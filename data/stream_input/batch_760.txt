0446677450|2.0|My father recently bought this book as he spirals further and further into debt with his wife and their ineptness in real estate.  While I do not blame this book for my dad's trouble, I do blame the simplistic nature of advice like this that does not take into account the fact that the working poor (which now includes my father, and once, included me) don't have the capital to incite the misadvetures promoted by the get-richers.  How poor, exactly, is the eponymous Poor Dad?<br /><br />The bottom line is this; no book is going to nmake you rich, unless you write it.  What has worked for this man probably won't work for you. My father once shorted a room out when changing outlet covers... I have no idea how he managed that one... but obviously he should not be attempting to \\"flip\\" houses.  If a book could actually make you rich, the idea would have caught on years ago and we'd all be rich... which would actually make us all poor.<br /><br />What is valuable about this book is that attitude.  But be careful if you don't have the safety nets that others have.  And don't be afraid to be conservative about your finance if that's where you find yourself.
B000001G1E|5.0|It's not an accident that almost all reviews of this box set give it five stars; it's also no accident that several people say they've owned this for over a decade and still find it fresh. James Brown was the most important American musician ever, completely altering the shape of music the world over, and this admirably complete collection will give you all the evidence you need as to why. Often shortened for 45s and radio play, the songs are presented in their full length; a few tracks (besides those from JB's famous \\"Live at the Apollo\\" record) are presented in well-selected live versions, giving those of us who never attended a concert some idea of the James Brown Band's consummate musicianship.<br /><br />The first CD, \\"Mr. Dynamite\\", covers Brown's early years up to the recording of \\"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\\". His major innovations were still to come, but he was a powerful conventional R&B singer and arranger, and the material stacks up very favorably with other '50s acts. The second CD, \\"The Hardest Working Man in Show Business\\", is where the magic happens: the band stretches out, rhythmically and in song length, such that tracks like \\"Cold Sweat\\" inaugurate a musical revolution -- and JB begins to articulate the new black consciousness in unforgettably clever aphorisms. \\"Soul Brother No. 1\\" illustrates the full-bore funk of Brown's \\"New Breed\\" (Bootsy Collins et al.); \\"The Godfather of Soul\\", the weakest CD (although that's not saying much), covers Brown's late-'70s and '80s output.<br /><br />Out of all the CDs I ever purchased, these are my clear favorites: and if any of the non-rock popular music of the last thirty years (hip-hop to house) has moved you, this will help you get an idea of where it all began.
B0013FDM7E|5.0|I would have to say that I am kind of a connoisseur of Apocalyptic movies and since I have never read the book everyone says this movie is based on; I went in with no preconceived notions of what it \\"Should Be\\"...     I thought the CG of New York was incredible and the creatures were believable and scary.  I do however question Neville's choice of car... Red Mustang?  Hello, Chick Car.  Why not get something more manly and more practical (since he was hunting) like a hemi powered pick-up?      Other than that all I can say about this movie is... WOW!  It was a great movie that gripped you right from the start and I did not feel like the tempo was up and down, like some have said.  I felt an affinity for Neville and at times understood what he was going through to some extent, not because I have been the lone survivor in a city hiding from zombies, but because the part was so well played by Will Smith and the crew that produced the movie did a fantastic job.     My final thoughts are this, it was a movie that left me thinking about it days later and at odd times because it was such a great movie, and I would recommend people to see the movie with an open mind and forget the book, if you want the book read it, enjoy the movie for what it is... a great movie.
6305511055|3.0|A movie that violates my cardinal rule as an amateur rewiewer: one should only have to see a film once for it to be comprehensible. I viewed Condor for the third time tonight, and I'm not sure that I've gotten it right yet. There is absolutely no need of acting talent like Redford, Dunaway, Robertson,and Houseman playing second fiddle to an inferior, confusing script. For the modern set, just imagine Kate Winslet, George Clooney, and Matt Damon suddenly showing up as operators 12, 14, and 15 in a remake of The Three Stooges'\\"Uncivil Warriors\\". The photography is vintage 1970's New York, and the lack of a musical score actually heightens the reality and suspense of the production. This is definitely not \\"My Fair Lady\\". Another point: Where are the police? 7 people dead and only one reported so by one cop? A prolonged sexual exchange between 2 people who seconds before were afraid of murdering each other? This is reality?            Anyway, I'm really sorry to go against the grain here. I just can't read the green!
B0011ZNAIC|3.0|Our story centers on Barry B. Benson (Jerry Seinfeld). He is a young bee ready to graduate from school. And boy, were those nine days hard. At least he had a perfect B average. He and his classmates are given their orientation at Honex, where they will choose their jobs for life.<br /><br />But Barry isn't ready for that. And the idea of doing one thing for the rest of his life doesn't excite him. So he slips in with the pollen brigade for one trip outside the hive first. It's a wonderful place with colors and flowers and fun.<br /><br />While outside the hive, he meets Vanessa (Renee Zellweger). He breaks bee rules and speaks to her. The two soon strike up a friendship and Barry even develops a crush. But a trip to the grocery store upsets Barry when he finds the row of honey.  So he decides to sue the human race to get the stolen honey back.  Will he win?<br /><br />When I saw this movie in the theater, most of the laughter was coming from the adults, not the kids.  And this was a Saturday matinee full of youngsters.  But even the adults didn't laugh as much as I thought they would.  While the jokes about the bee life span and the bee society like ours were funny, once Barry left the hive, everything felt old and recycled.<br /><br />The plot wasn't much better.  While one plot point followed another, it felt like it rambled and wandered.  I did like the ending, but the journey there was rather unfocused.<br /><br />Now that's not a knock on the voice cast.  Filled with top notch actors, they did a great job.  In fact, I didn't recognize most of them until I looked at the credits.  The animation is stylized, so it isn't as realistic looking as many of today's films.  Still, it is fine and the flying sequences are lots of fun.<br /><br />I laughed, but not as much as I expected to.  I didn't hate the film, but I'm not rushing out to buy it either.  You certainly won't be missing much if you wait a few months until the price on this one starts dropping as it heads for the bargain bin.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|Best british film ever. If you haven't seen it. Like Goethe says, I shall paraphase his philosophy and say;<br /><br />\\"If you have no watched a movie like this and not felt the emotions of this film. You have not experienced life yet.\\"
0143038419|5.0|Maybe I just read this book at the right time in my life, but it touched a chord and I found it both highly inspiring and wonderfully entertaining.
0060989157|5.0|All of these things...and more.  What a book!!!!  I PROMISE you - you won't put this down.  You'll spend time with Ozzy, Nikki Sixx's addictions, his death and resurrection, Tommy Lee's women, Vince Neil's drinking and Mick Mars' diseases.  Like a good movie...this is the type of book that you don't want to end.  It's on to reading The Heroin Diaries for me now.  Was never a huge Crue fan - was always more of a GNR or Metallica guy, but now am going back and jamming to all their old songs.  GET THIS BOOK!!!!
B0010YSD7M|4.0|I just reviewed The Ark of Truth and felt that they took one season and forced it into a 2 hour frame. I blame the scifi channel for that one. Over all the movie was excellent but I felt that in the beginning of the movie they could have dug a little deeper on the alteran/ori rift. The quick witted humor, and special effects were great, not to mention the cinematography too. The movie left a lot of open doors for future movies so that is a positive note. There was one thing that I expected in the movie and did not see it, I will not mention it because of the spoil potential. Over all I give the movie 4 out of 5 stars. I will say this, War and Peace can never be compressed into a readers digest book. Neither can this story. I recommend purchasing this movie instead of torrent site download, so we can look forward to more than just Continuum. Enjoy!! jim
0321544080|5.0|Great stories and very helpful tech suggestions.  Shows you what it takes on both a personal and professional level to be a freelance photographer.  Some of the stories at the end had me laughing out loud.
1596061308|5.0|John Scalzi has created an enjoyable and thoughtfull read.  The main character is humorous and human.  Not a 100% hero, just a guy trying to do the best with what he has.  The pacing is great.  Some of the characters are a bit generic and colorless, but the story is redeemed by the humanity of the old guy who is the centre of the action.  Science is not twisted too much, and neither overwhelms the book.  There are some strange anachronisms concerning Earth's backwardness.  But the inventivness and freshness of the story keeps your hooked to the end.

B000ASDFEU|4.0|The title says it all.  Acting was good and good battle sceens.  I would recommand this for any WW 2 movie collection.
0143038419|2.0|First of all, the whole reason I wanted to read this book was because I had a writing assignment that had a basis of some excerpts from different books. About spirituality, enlightenment, verities of life etc... The excerpts I read were intriguing and I had to go out and buy the book to read the whole thing. I loved her deftness and clever wits in which she wrote from. I quickly changed my opinion as I got the book and started reading the whole thing. The author, Liz Gilbert aka \\"Liss\\", \\"Groceries\\" and whatever other names you want, was completely self-righteous and absorbed within her own mindset and I'm not so sure she gained a whole lot more from these travels than some pounds from all the food in Italy she ate. I truly got IRRITATED how she talks so highly of her beauty and sexuality and yada yada yada. I don't care. Give me something material or insightful to work with here. I put my book down for over a week, then decided I spent the money on it so I might as well finish. I never not finish a book, but I will say that is was sincerely considered. I don't suggest buying this book. If you ABSOLUTELY must read it (which I advise against) get it for free from the library. Also, she's all \\"poor me this, poor me that\\" through the whole thing. She IS that person who thinks she is better than anyone she encounters, and she even admits it in the book. If you are peeved by people who cut you off mid-story, she will get under your skin. I do love the way she writes though. I'd read a book by her, just not another one about her. I could go on, but I think you get the point.
B000RF1QDI|5.0|Great movie, looks good and always a pleasure to watch.  The HD really brightens up the picture and makes everything that much more vivid.
0671015206|4.0|but sometimes it belabours the point a bit too much. Note - some of the examples/tables are very USA-specific, but it has a fair few nuggets of interesting information.
1400082773|5.0|A great biography of a phenomenal politician. I would highly recommend this biography to anyone interested in the life of Barack Obama.
B000002IAZ|5.0|\\"Retrospective\\" rates in my book as one of the seminal albums to come out of the sixties, and considering the groundbreaking music to come from that era, this is no mean feat. (Consider Cream's \\"Disraeli Gears or \\"Wheels of Fire\\" or Jimi Hendrix's \\"Are You Experienced\\" or \\"The Doors\\" or The Beatles \\"White Album & Rubber Soul...\\".)  I could go on forever about the incredible music bursting on the horizon throughout that glorious musical decade. However,  \\"Retrospective\\" never seems to get ranked in the top echelon of the sixties albums in polls and/or surveys.  For What It's Worth (no pun intended,)\\"Retro\\" rates as one of my top ten albums of all time.  Each song is a masterpiece in it's own right. This is a perfect album.
0307237702|5.0|A great book to read if you want a little more insight into the political ideals of Barack Obama. Highly Recommended!
B0011HOEY4|3.0|The star director, cast and expense was wasted on this film. Frank Lucas was a man who could not READ OR COUNT. Considering he was a black person from Harlem at a time when there were plenty more powerful gangsters in New York, this 'achievement' makes him a business phenomenon.    The movie is a somewhat interesting story on a gangster related topic but does not convey what Frank Lucas was and could have been more accurate towards his life which in reality was extraordinary.    Lucas imported drugs inside coffins JUST ONCE whereas the movie portrays it as the usual business model. The point here is that the movie is good as a fictional creation but compared to Lucas and his life it is just an average movie and certainly not in the league of GoodFellas or The Godfather - But it could have been as good if not better.    Most people will also not realize that Frank Lucas 'over-dressing' for the boxing match and sitting in seats in front of the Italian Mafia was a huge blunder. This single incident was a miscalculation (due to his wife) and which drew attention to Lucas. The lesson of flying under the radar is obvious but the movie does not stitch the lessons behind the Lucas story in a way that can be easily appreciated.    And this is why I give this move 3 stars because considering the money and talent invested - the movie is not up to the mark.
B00005JPTK|1.0|why cant someone just do justice to richard matheson's short story...the ending to this movie sucked and distorted the entire point/moral to matheson's story...and where the eff was neville? one neville scene and the story ending and everything would have been ok, sorry hollywood, you lack vision
0143143492|5.0|Great addition to the book, allowing you to hear the author in his own words, read what was written.
B000ZK4466|5.0|This is going to be short. And general. Ok. I am a Mars Volta fan and have been since their beginning. This album is the culmination of their genius up to this point. Some might dismiss them as too cryptic or whatever but when you get down to it, they are simply a group of extremely talented musicians. And I thank them and give them credit for putting Thomas Pridgen on a bigger map; he is a truly spirited musician who really does his instrument and the band's music more than justice. This group of musicians, with Cedric and Omar as the creative head,  makes me excited about music today. This is not meant to be some sort of snobbery; they play with their heart and make you feel like youre somewhere or like youre going somewhere else. They are different. And different is good.   It could be said that the time of important music has passed. The Bedlam in Goliath should be listened to once- if you don't like it, you don't like it. At least you will have given a chance to something important and exciting that is happening RIGHT NOW.
B00005JM02|5.0|My only complaint is that my son just want to watch it over and over and over... Great Movie.
B0011U8NZ2|5.0|for those of us that are doors fans that feel the studio albums are the best the doors have to offer this albums comes as a surprize in its quality in both sound and showmanship. jim gives some top quality live performances of studio classics, but the best of this album is jims ability to play songs live that are not in their studio releases. when the musics over and someday soon are great examples of quality showmanship that give the band a uniqueness in their live performances to always come up with something new and unexpected.higly recommended along with live in detroit and philly.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|lot's of great performances.  this set is rich with performance and low on interviews.  has some interviews but not too much.  ray charles and stevie wonder are amazing - sends chills down you.      not a big country fan, but the country performances here are great.  george jones, t. wynette, waylon jennings, hank jr. are exceptional.
3795753384|5.0|This book has the full vocal score, well-printed, well laid-out.  If you're doing Carmina, you want this score!  Clear type, adequate size, good binding, and you can see what the other parts are doing, which really helps most choral singers.    Expensive, but worth it.  Particularly if you're going to do Carmina maybe 5-10 times in your career.

1594481784|4.0|while i was reading this i kept finding my self saying this is being pulled straight from my head! very witty real and hysterical, the only thing holding it back from a 5 star is the fact that its too british but still a classic
0452289963|5.0|If you have read this book or buy it and read it, and then understand it, you will be forever grateful for authors like Tolle.  For the world as we have known it is changing and Tolle and other authors such as the Hicks, Neale Walsh, Don Miguel Ruiz, Alberto Villoldo, Rhonda Byrne, Gregg Braden, Wayne Dyer and Karen Bishop, just to mention a few, are bringing us the messages in such a positive and understandable way to help us help ourselves and therefore, speed up these changes one person at a time.  The insights Tolle gives us as to how our ego works are invaluable!  I thought I was doing pretty good before I read the book, but now I am aware of many situations in which my ego has controlled my life.  As the awareness grows, I am able to let the ego dissolve and face the situation from a place of peace and compassion.  I would recommend this book, A New Earth, to any and all who would like to change their lives for the positive...and therefore, help change the world into a better place to live and grow.
B00026WU64|5.0|Before Bob Dylan went electric and rocked, he was a simple folkie with a guitar and harmonica.  Before the ambitions of Blonde On Blonde and Blood On The Tracks, he simply cared about getting his messages out to people.  Before he was a legend, he was well on his way there with this release.  Folk is the simplest music instrumentally but the most complex lyrically.  Here, Dylan delivers his best folk album.  An album with no instrumental flash whatsoever.  Just lyrical gold.    This album finds a young Bob Dylan just as mature as ever in his songwriting.  Classics like 'Blowin' In The Wind' and 'Don't Think Twice It's Alright' have become folk staples but other tracks like 'Masters Of War' and 'A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall' pack just a big a punch.  When you're a folk artist with limited vocal capabillities and only a few instruments, every word in your songs has to count.  'Masters Of War' contains increasingly powerful chorus lines and the verses of 'Blowin' In The Wind' all relate well to the central theme of the song.  Bob Dylan has clearly mastered his craft and he doesn't let a single wasted moment appear on this album.    The moods here are more varied than usual.  He goes from the serious political critique of 'Masters Of War' to the light romance of 'Down The Highway' to the campy humor of 'Bob Dylan's Dream'.  Don't expect any rockin' guitar solos, relentless beats, or screaming vocals.  This is folk and it's all about the lyrical delivery.    Dylan would, of course, go on to produce 'rock records' but 'Freewheelin' is basically 'Highway 61' minus the electric instruments.  He may never have made it that far if he hadn't practiced his songwriting here before plugging in the electric guitar.  A true classic of folk music, this is a must have for anyone interested in experiencing Dylan's musical visions.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Ok I am a huge fan of musicals but there have been some dreadful cinematic treatments of many musicals.  Rob Marshall's brilliant vision in adapting the phenomenal Broadway revival (still running on B'way as of Mar/08) to screen is a pleasure and a guilty one at that!  Superb performances all around and of course Zeta-Jones deserves her Oscar although Queen Latifah gave as good as it gets.  Richard Gere is a delight as the smarmy lawyer and sings with an appropriate 1920's nasal tenor!  Obviously I give this film a high recommendation and looking forward to watching it over and over.
0143143492|5.0|For me, this book has been truly life changing and I am thankful for it's existance. It's about \\"living in the now\\", and not having your mind so caught up in future or past events.  Acceptance and Awareness are also helpful themes.  I find it to be an excellent tool for reducing anxiety.   If you are at a time in your life when a change is needed, you will really get a lot of out it.  I may not have been open-minded enough to read this book when I was a bit younger.  But now approaching 40 and feeling stressed with a busy work and family life I am staring to see my body rebel.  This book has helped me.  It is a spiritual book (not religious); it does not preach but offers a wonderful philisophy that rings true with me.
0307387178|4.0|This is a very very good read.  I devoured it in an afternoon.  Krakauer is a very strong writer who puts together a journalistic and even keeled chronicle of McCandless' life.  I particularly appreciated the story of his personal experience on Devils Thumb.  This vignette and comments throughout do an excellent and professional job of getting the writers bias fairly on the page.    Highly Rec'd.
B000WCBPOG|2.0|No amount of aural Bactine or Numzit will help. Painful mixes combined with some excruciatingly bad covers. I'd give this at least a couple of Courics, thanks to the presence of Bone-O, but after hearing the rest of this canine, yuck. Sometimes soundtracks should remain unreleased.
B00004RFFI|5.0|Probably the best disaster movie made about tornadoes/twisters.  The special effects were really exciting if you can overlook the inaccurate scenes enhanced for dramatic effect.  It was a good balance between the story and the action.  Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton were really good - actually the whole cast was wonderful.
B000ZOXDFA|2.0|There's very little substance of any kind here. You do get lots of beautiful costumes, sets, some decent naval scenes, and endless posing. Cate and Clive both look marvelous, simply marvelous. Cate certainly belts her lines out with conviction and Clive does a very reasonable Errol Flynn. But there's no center to this film, no evidence that any thought went into it at all. To borrow a bit more from the Bard himself, while there's lots of sound and fury, it signifies nothing.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|As you've probably figured out from my other reviews, I'm a major Floyd fan.  This is a tour I wish I could have seen because it had David Gilmour and Richard Wright which is about 50% of Floyd.  (Well actually 40% if you want to be technical)  Alas, I wasn't able to see it but they did do a movie of it.    When I found out this DVD was coming out, I was waiting patiently and was happy when it finally came out.  I picked it up at the store and as I was watching it, one of the tracks had a skip.  So I took it back and got another one.  It had a skip in the same spot.  So I went to another store and finally got a good copy.    The selection of songs are pretty good.  I'm happy with the mix.  I'm glad that he included some of his solo stuff and I'm also glad that he included some Floyd stuff.  Combine this DVD with my In Flesh DVD and you could have a good thing (75% of Floyd this time).
B000A1ENCU|5.0|I too have been waiting a long time for a restored DVD of this classic and inspiring film.  The wait is finally over and expect a fully restored Ultra-Resolution DVD set 4th Qtr 2008.  The reason for the delay has been the poor quality of the source film that has required extensive work.
0439813786|5.0|A Caldecott winner, the pencil sketch format along with the sophisticated voice in the story approach made this \\"picture book\\" a hit with my 9 year old, an advanced reader.  I recommend it for all ages, to read and be read.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This movie was beautiful, funny, crazy and fun. I highly recommened buying the soundtrack too. It was impressive that most of the actors in this movie were not singers, they were so on key that you would hope they would eventually release thier own record. Great movie!
B00000G3PA|5.0|A very good disaster movie with intense action packed scenes.  The special effects were great.  Everyone could find something as there was action, humor, romance, and emotional moments.  I guess what I liked about the movie most was the chemistry between the cast.  Not just between Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler, but the between the drilling crew.
044024238X|5.0|This was the first book I read by Sophie Kinsella - and I have already ordered more.  I actually laughed outloud throughout and could not stop turning pages.  Absolutely loved it!!!  The perfect mix of romtantic comedy - believable or not, it was definitely enjoyable!  Fantastically funny and FUN!!!  Even if you do not like reading - please read this book!
159562015X|5.0|Great insights!   First of all: quick, easy and clear assessment through internet. Results are presented to the point, detailed and personalized about one's strengths.   Each of 5 defined \\"strength themes' is accompanied with 10 action ideas.   This is a real must do!
B000ZN803G|5.0|Honestly, I want to beat Mr. \\"I'm so smart, I know the way of life\\" Christopher McCandless into sense.  Not because I hate him, but perhaps I feel I know him a little more than what a movie audience should have with his/her movie character.  He is one of my all-time \\"I hate to identify with\\" characters.<br /><br />Now, if you could understand what I was trying to say, then you are required to watch this movie.  Your life is probably on the brink of ostracizing yourself \\"into the wild.\\"  You don't need to go on a self-proving trip or do some odd self-destructive behaviors to know \\"happiness is only real when shared\\"..., so watch this movie, and you shall find salvation.<br /><br />Twenty-three years old is too young to know the way of life....  I found that out when I was twenty-eight.  LOL!  I didn't die.  Our Supertramp did.  Now that's the lesson for ya!  ;-)<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, and watch the movie again, and listen carefully what everyone was saying to him.  Answer to the quest he gave to himself was all there..., but he didn't listen (but kept talking).  I think it's easy to be absorbed into McCandless's view point and ignore every other character's, because it feels all so urgently important.  At least that's how I felt when I was obsessed with my own world view when I was at his phase.<br /><br />No spoiler for you.  :-D<br /><br />The HD-DVD version of this movie is essentially the same as the 2-disc Special Edition (but with native 1080p resolution of course).  No zoom via A button, but bookmark via B button works.  5.1 Dolby Digital+ surround is available for English, French and Spanish (but no Danish as listed in Amazon).  Subtitle info is accurate (two types of English subtitle, one is plain, the other one is for the deaf and hearing impaired).
B00027JZ3E|5.0|The 80's no doubt was the most exciting time for movies specially horror.All i have to say ifyou like horror films(vampire)films of course get it or even if you are just a corey's fan get it great film
0783225547|5.0|In 1997 there were two eagerly anticipated volcano movies released.  Dante's Peak was more of a blockbuster hit, with more entertainment value, but not very accurate from a geologist's standpoint.    Had it been based on reality instead of Hollywood, they all would have died early in the movie.  You can't drive through lava.  Since it can get up to 2000 degrees, the vehicle would have perished immediately.  I also don't know many metal objects like a small boat that can survive direct contact with acid elements and remain floating indefinitely.    With all that said it was a good entertaining movie.  Pierce Brosnan is always a must see!
B0000067L4|5.0|This is an all time classic.  If you a younger type looking for \\"finds\\", this would be one of them.  Every song is excellent.
B00104QSOM|1.0|This is a relentlessly unpleasant film, whose consistant depiction of some of the more apalling aspects of human behavior is not in the least bit redeamed by any historical accuracy.     I can appreciate a truthful telling of an difficult slice of history...Band of Brothers, Matewan, but that is not what this movie does. It creates two deeply flawed individuals and rubs them and their moral decline into your face for three hours.       Can this really be a movie that viewers enjoy? Are their people whose lives are so wonderful, so happy, so completely untouched by misery that they need There Will be Blood to show them what they're missing?    Or is it possible to appreciate the skillful rendering of something awful? Can people take pleasure in well crafted torture?    Beats me.
B00004YYDI|4.0|I still don't know why I love this movie so much. I am by nature a very calm sort of peaceful person, never in a million years I would have wasted money in renting a violent movie let alone buying it! But this movie really goes beyond violence. In fact, the violence aspect is only a facade for a most intrinsic and pure message: Love germinate in all enviroment no matter how harsh or hostile the environment is. And what's more it's cleverly done so by the outstanding acting of Portman, Reno and Oldman.
B000BAQ8A0|5.0|I almost didn't buy it because of the STUPID COSTUMES. But the DVD I had bought featured a homely guy with a great voice. He just wasn't convincing as a \\"love interest.\\" This tenor JUAN, on the other hand, is the handsomest opera singer I've ever seen, and my girlfriend went NUTS over him as well as the audience. The enunciation of the singers was superb, and the whole cast was hilariouly funny.  So much more enjoyable than the other DVD with the American singer from Detroit. I would just love to slap the costumer because the polka dots didn't work, and made the leading lady look like a matron instead of a young girl. The sets were terrific though. This is an opera you can see over and over again for the acting and the laughs.
B00003CX8V|3.0|I watched this on the advise of a friend who thought this was \\"an essential\\". Robert Osbourne praised this on TCM too.<br /><br /> Robert Osbourn commented it was neither a comedy, nor a drama but something in between or in it's own class. My friend thinks it is  \\"hysterical\\".<br /><br />Everyone has opinions, sometimes they contradict as is the case with my view of this film.<br /><br />I think in it's day, yes it probably was hysterical.I think the problem is its aging badly.<br /><br />Also, I was not convinced a man would really sleep on a park bench rather than keep his job ranking.<br /><br />This is personal opinion.
0143038419|1.0|I really thought it would be better due to hearing rave reviews about this book..and the premise seemed interesting but i was very disappointed. Fortunately, I rented the book at the library. Anyways, i found the author to be trivial and immature at times..the book also lagged on..and I don't know how i made it up to page 84..but after that i couldn't take anymore and i returned the book back to the library. I hear they're going to make a movie out of this book. I just hope it isnt as boring as the book. Although, I'm dubious about that because Julia roberts isn't exactly a great actress.

A young girl lets her imagination get away with her when she visits friends at an old house.

B000ZN8036|5.0|At first, I wasn't sure how to feel about INTO THE WILD. I'd read the book a few years ago and enjoyed it, but it left me feeling a bit bitter about someone as privileged as Chris McCandless (the main character/person in Jon Krakauer's nonfiction novel by the same name) who shuns his upper echelon possibilities after graduating from Emory and disappears into America, leading the free life of a moneyless vagabond.<br /><br />Certainly we've all thought about what it would be like to be completely unencumbered by the shackles of \\"things.\\" No cars. No mortgages/rent. Nothing but the open road and endless options spreading out before us. And this is what makes us care for Chris McCandless, the unfortunate (and very misguided) young man who's fate is tied to his own ignorance of what that kind of life entails.<br /><br />If you speak to anyone from Alaska, most will tell you what an idiot McCandless was. He went into the wild with only a backpack and a rifle, supposedly \\"ready\\" to live the life of a hermit on a decrepit and abandoned school bus. The Alaskan wilderness (or any comparable wilderness really) is unforgiving. If you aren't prepared, you're going to die. And McCandless, with his lofty dreams of wildlife living, was ill-prepared in the extreme; his life cut short due to his own ignorance.<br /><br />So why the five star rating, you may ask? Well, I'm not here to support or degrade what McCandless did or didn't do. I'm here to rate the film, and on that, you can't help but appreciate what director Sean Penn has given us. Showing McCandless' strengths and weaknesses, Penn guides us through the life of Chris without telling us how to feel about it. Actor Emile Hirsch pulls in an extremely powerful performance as Chris McCandless. The fact that the Academy didn't recognize him is a shame; they did note Hal Holbrook's supporting actor performance (which was damn good), but a far cry from Hirsch's awesome job (he lost 40 lbs during the filming so that he could show McCandless' starvation). Penn's screenwriting and directing are flat-out amazing, giving us a story that allows the viewer to make his or her own judgements about this very enigmatic young man.<br /><br />I feel compelled to mention that some may compare McCandless' actions with those of another dead Alaskan visitor, Timothy Treadwell of the nonfiction film [[ASIN:B000BMY2NS Grizzly Man]]. Although both certainly had their failings, Treadwell was definitely mentally ill, while McCandless simply seemed to lack life goals and instead substituted vagrancy in order to run away from problems back home.<br /><br />In the end, I finally came to the conclusion that Penn did exactly what all great film makers do: he gave us a story that many people probably would've found pretentious and plopped it into our laps without any filters or rose-coloring. That put the burden on the audience to come to terms with what McCandless' life really meant. Fool? Free-Spirit? Ignorant preppie? Loving brother? Easy-going drifter? Or perhaps a mesh of many of those.<br /><br />You decide.Penn's screenwriting and directing are flat-out amazing, giving us a story that allows the viewer to make his or her own judgements about this very enigmatic young man.

B00000AFDW|4.0|There are a lot of people who dislike Psycho Circus.  Fine.  I do get the dissent.      I get that it's not a \\"real\\" Kiss reunion through-and-through.  It simply isn't...and it could and should have been more of one.  No excuses.  It was sold as something it merely pretends to be (for the most part) and so there's a definite despicable quality to it knowing that, if you never ever hear a single note.    However, and this really is a BIG however, how often do you remember an album for the integrity of it versus the quality?  Truth be told I'm not looking forward to GNR's Chinese Democracy because I'm bitter it's just Axl Rose and a bunch of \\"other guys.\\"  But in the end it'll come down to one thing:  how good is the music?  Because the reunion doesn't mean anything if the songs suck.  That's the big picture truth.      At the end of the day, I like the songs on Psycho Circus for a number of reasons I'll get into below.  No, I don't buy that Peter \\"couldn't\\" have played on Within...or Ace couldn't have laid down a solo for Raise Your Glasses.  That's lazy Gene and Paul simply side-stepping a problem by conveniently working around it.  I think that's lame.  But in the end, I'm left feeling good about the music and in the grand scheme of things, what lasts?  Does anyone really care still that Ace didn't do the solo on Sweet Pain off Destroyer?  Maybe Ace does.  You either like the song or you don't.  Or that Eric Carr played bass on I Still Love You instead of Gene?  Does it really matter if the song is good?  I don't care who played on Read My Body, it's a crappy song.  Jesus could've done the lead work and I wouldn't care.    What I love about this record is how it works thematically.  It really is Destroyer Part 2 in design, even though the execution is modern.  You open with a \\"going to the show\\" vibe, which Detroit Rock City did and which Psycho Circus does.  You have numerous songs on this record lament and reflect back on a career, mirrored with Destroyer's \\"we're rock stars on the rise...watch out!\\" flavor.  You have album heavies in God Of Thunder and Within (both Gene tunes)....album anthems in Shout It Out Loud and Raise Your Glasses (both Paul songs)...and tender ballads in Beth and I Finally Found My Way (each Peter-sung).  Do You Love Me reflects We Are One, both addressing fandom.  Both albums are very heavily produced, thick and lush...layered with strings and in Destroyer's case, effects.  They're both thematic and aural bookends to the same career....one looking forward and the other in the rearview.    You hear very FEW people talk about this...and the satisfaction of it.  Maybe only I see it...or want to see it (LOL).  Either way, beyond the songs, this perspective has a great sentimental quality to it that appeals to me.      Psycho Circus (A):  Just a great song and a wonderful album opener.  I think the circus \\"effects\\" are creepy and atmospheric.  The song is heavy and simple with a great chorus...not nearly as full as Detroit Rock City but a solid opener with very much the same sentiment.  Lyrically the song works...the appealing to the fan perspective.      Within (A-): Clearly a left-over from the Carnival Of Souls album, this song sort of stands out like a bastard in the sense of the sound of the guitars (real crunch here), but lyrically it's wonderful and has a great tie into the final song on the album.  This was my first real indication Ace wasn't going to appear everywhere on the album, as it's a sound you'd never hear from Frehley...even if he tried.  But nevertheless (and again, I side with song over Ace-less disdain) it's a fine song, well sung by Gene.    I Pledge Allegiance To The State Of Rock And Roll (B+):  Very good rocking tune that has an 80s arena flavor to it.  Another simple number with an effective melody and some great vocals by Paul.      Into The Void (A-):  This song remains the ONLY song on the album featuring Peter on drums and one of only two to have Ace on guitar.  In fact, according to engineer Mike Plotnikof, it's a song where they all played it pretty much live in the studio, so in truth, it's the only actual reunion song.  Ace brought the music, Gene the lyrics, Paul added some accent guitars...and voila, an honest to God Kiss collaboration that feels like one.  It's not as good as the most classic Ace but it's a fun song just the same and quite a signature piece to be sure.    We Are One (A):  This is arguably the best song on the record and drums aside, it's a Gene solo effort (bass, guitars, all vocals).  Still and all, it works...with Gene tapping into his less demon facets and striking mostly from his Beatles background.  The jangling guitars are very contemporary and had Green Day done this song, it'd have been a number one single.  Lyrically the song sincerely reflects back on Kiss fandom and the ability to be brought back from the edge of obscurity and into the lap of your old life.  It's poppy and simple but marvelously effective, not to mention catchy as hell.    You Wanted The Best (C):  If there's a weak link its this song, mainly due to its atrocious and barely-listenable chorus...sounding more like a choir of tone-deaf Eyeores than multiple Gene Simmonses.  However the music is fine and the design is what saves it from the heap.  Each member shares a line or two of each verse and that's quite effective and charming.  The solo is the other Ace effort on the record (and a fine one at that) and the talky banter at the end is witty and clever.  But the song is typical contrived Gene, shoe-horning a song around a catch phrase and making square pegs fit round holes.    Raise Your Glasses (B):  Ok, it's uber cheesy.  (So is using \\"uber\\").  BUT the song is a real guilty pleasure.  I dare you to not be singing along by your second listen.  You'll also wonder how this song isn't a regular at the end of championship sports broadcasts.  One listen to the melody and \\"we are the champions\\"-like lyrics and you'll be able to see your favorite sports franchise hoisting its banner/trophy/medal over their respective heads and thrusting a \\"number 1\\" finger in the air.  But still, for what it is and what it attempts to accomplish, it's hard to fault it.  It's hardly genius, but its effectively exuberant.     I Finally Found My Way (B+):  I don't find this song nearly as offensive or schmaltzy as some people do.  I think it's very much in the same songwriting vein as the oft-overlooked Kiss tune from Revenge, Every Time I Look At You...and vocally Peter does a fine job.  We even get some unique Paul background accents with Peter's voice in the chorus.  (Yes, it was to cover up Peter's limitation but it works).  The arrangements were done by Bob Ezrin, who co-wrote the song with Paul.  I've heard far more vomit-inducing tunes than this, but then again I generally like a sincere ballad.      Dreamin' (A):  Paul and Bruce Kulick were sued by Alice Cooper's publishing company for copying the melody to Eighteen, but I've never heard it.  Beyond that, I don't much care.  Revenge's I Just Wanna does an even more blatant take on Eddie Cochran's Summertime Blues and you never hear that mentioned.  Anyhow, Dreamin' is a great song that to me sounds like it could've fit nicely on Creatures Of The Night.  It's a wonderful verse vocal by Paul that segues into a full, rich chorus, accented by these note bends that really give an ominous atmosphere to the song.  It's often dismissed as \\"80s type filler\\" but I really beg to differ.  It's one of my favorites on the record and a great song in its own right.    Journey Of 1000 Years (A+):  My favorite song on the album, at top 25 Kiss song of all time to me, and easily the most overlooked single Kiss song since God knows when.  It's not destined for the stage...and it's hardly a rocker.  It's studio created and intended.  It's not a demonic Gene tune or a sexual Gene lyric.  It's definitely Beatle-esque in every way that's admirable.  The lyrics harken back to word playfrom Within, making for a marvelous thematic bookend to the record.  And the music is this very orchestrated, percussive piece that has a strong dynamic and a definite \\"Day In The Life\\" feel to it.    Overall it's easy to dismiss this album.  It doesn't feature the original members on most of the record.  It doesn't sound like classic 70s Kiss.  It's really set up to be a letdown.  But I think that there's a lot of magical and fun moments within (har) these songs for the most part.  No...it's not Destroyer in the most literal sense, nor would it or will it ever flirt with that album's historic importance...but it does act as a fine bookend to that album.  I think it succeeds on many levels often ignored for the more glaring blights.  And it's not that we shouldn't resent the band for their transgressions.  We should.  They bungled an opportunity to do something really special by doing something under-handed and deceitful.  Problem with hating the album for me is that despite those things they still managed to make something \\"really special.\\"    Approach this album differently and re-listen.

B00006BIO0|5.0|Comments about the treble roll off (see note below) of JSP's edition compared with other editions (I have Yazoo's on vinyl, and Document's & Revenant's on compact disc) are reasonable, but the person who appreciates Charley Patton enough to acquire any edition of his complete recordings should be or become familiar with the quantitative and qualitative limitations of the source recordings: not a lot of copies of any Patton record exist, they're often pretty beaten up, and Paramount's studio where Patton recorded most of them was notoriously primitive.  Many of us may be quite willing to accept some sort of sonic compromise in the remastering process.  Really it comes down to a matter of how much the listener wants to struggle through varying amounts of surface noise to get to the music--some of Patton's recordings have been, until now, nearly inaudible behind so much surface noise.  Give the folks at JSP credit for trying to do something a little clearer than the purists at Yazoo and Document (not to slight them in any way--God bless your souls, Nick Perls and Johnny Parth!) and more economical than the lavish designers at Revenant (God bless you too, John Fahey!).    However, one reviewer's remarks about royalties are NOT irrelevant: Charley Patton's estate actually does exist, and if anyone deserves royalties, it's Patton's descendants, still alive and well in Mississippi. That said, the whole business of reissuing blues and old time music from the twenties and thirties (this business dating back to the fifties) is largely a case study in \\"bootlegging\\" by the independent labels and the withholding of royalties by the major labels. Why shouldn't the folks at JSP get their fair share in exchange for making such a crucial set of historical documents available at a reasonable price?     With regard to the payment of royalties, how many of us REALLY care?  Intellectual property rights are a legal fiction, and generally serve the interests of the privileged few.  You want a company that's likely to pay royalties?  Buy overpriced product from the major labels, most of whom wouldn't touch the music JSP sells with a ten foot pole since no mass market audience exists for it and there are, consequently, no big bucks to be made from it.  Ideally, of course Patton's estate would get money from the sales of any Charley Patton product.  Maybe I'm just really selfish, but if it came down to one or the other--honest business or dissemination of music--I'd take the music every time.  I'd like to believe that someone like Charley Patton would agree (though I can imagine he would not!). If we buy JSP's box sets because we love this music, how important is the question of royalties?  JSP seems to be about the music, not the money, so let's just be grateful for what we've got!    Now quit reading this rambling drivel and pay attention to something worthwhile: Charley Patton or Blind Lemon Jefferson, also in a wonderfully remastered (and slightly rolled off) box set by JSP.    Note--\\"Treble roll off\\" occurs in the remastering process when surface noises are removed: when the frequencies in which surface noise occur are removed so as to clean up the sound of the record, some of the frequencies we associate with the treble qualities of the music are removed too, making the music sound less bright.

1594489505|5.0|I can imagine a lot of people, hearing the buzz about Hosseini's second novel, saying to themselves: A book about poverty and repression in Afghanistan? Um, sure, I'll get to that one, just as soon as I finish \\"War and Peace.\\" But you don't have to be a CNN addict or a poli-sci grad student to enjoy this book. Even if the only thing you know about Afghanistan is that it's got a lot of caves and women wear blue tent-like things, from the first pages of this book you will feel as if you're reading about the lives of aunts and cousins you never knew you had. This is one of those amazing novels that lets you forget you're reading.    If you *are* a CNN addict or have a more than passing interest in recent Afghan history, it would be easy to read \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" as an indictment of the Taliban and an account of the suffering caused by the most repressive forms of Islam. To an extent that may be true, but to come away from this amazing book with only that understanding is to miss the complexity of Hosseini's narrative. Mariam, the soul of the book, lives in circumstances almost unaffected by the regime (democratic, communist, Mujahideen, Taliban) in power. For Mariam as for the other characters here, suffering comes from any situation in which some people are granted complete control without consequence over the lives of others. \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is a story of enormous suffering, of a country and the people who live there ground into dust. But woven into these stories of hardship and pain is a larger story of endurance and the tenacious power of love. In the end, it is the characters' love of each other and of the dream of Afghanistan as it could be (\\"One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs, Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls\\") that creates a story that can bring you to tears and yet somehow not break your heart.
0140042393|5.0|For the last few years I've been on a quest to read the one hundred greatest books ever written.  Unfortunately I've discovered that there doesn't seem to be any consensus as to which books deserve to be on that list.  Out of the three lists I've come upon only two books were even listed more than once (\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\", and \\"Of Mice and Men\\" both by John Steinbeck), so I've been forced to read as many books as possible from all of the lists to try and compose my own.<br /><br />Based on the listings I suspected the \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" was going to be a special book so I wanted to own the hardback copy of it, but since it has been out of print for so long I finally broke down and just bought the paperback.  Let me just say that this is one of the best novels ever written and certainly will make my final listing.  It definitely was deserving of the Nobel prize it received.<br /><br />Written in 1939 this book captures the story of the Joad family during the Great Depression when thousands of families left their farms in Oklahoma and moved out to California to try to improve their fortunes, only to find sorrow and death waiting for them there.<br /><br />The story opens with Tom Joad being released from prison on parole for a charge of murder he committed in self defense.  He returns home after being away for several years only to find his family packing up and moving away.  The crops hadn't been good for several seasons and the banks were foreclosing on the loans.  Small farmers were being squeezed out by the big corporations and people were forced to try to find a different profession.<br /><br />When handbills arrive declaring that there was plenty of work out in California picking crops the people took it as a sign of hope.  They sold most of their possessions, packed whatever was left up in a broken down truck and headed west on route 66.<br /><br />The Joad Family consisting of fourteen people and friends plus one dog, along with all of their belongings set out for the trip in just one truck that they bought from a very charismatic salesman and had customized.  (I'm sorry but this was one of the few things in the story I had a problem with, since I just couldn't picture it.  I'm one of seven kids and the nine of us could never fit in a station wagon.  How did fourteen people and a dog fit in one truck with all of our belongings?)  There was Mr. and Mrs. Joad, Grandma and Grandpa Joad, Uncle John, Casy the former preacher, the boys Noah, Tom, Al, and little Winfield, and then there was the daughter Rosasharon (Rose of Sharon) who was pregnant along with her husband Connie, Rosasharon's younger sister Ruthie, plus the dog...<br /><br />While home on the farm when there was work Mr. Joad and the men ran the family, but when they got out on the road without any work Mr. Joad became a lost without his purpose in life, and Mrs. Joad had to take over as the head of the family.  She made all of the tough decisions on the road and showed her strength to keep everyone going.  Uncle John is a dark soul who had never forgiven himself for not being able to do more for his wife when she got sick and died.  He fluctuates in the novel between being a drunk and someone who gives away all of his possessions to the kids to try to make it up to the world.  The oldest son Noah I believe is mentally challenged due to a birthing accident and is kind of lost with all of the changes.  Tom who is the next oldest son represents justice and truth throughout the novel.  Al is a tomcat who's always out looking for girls, but wants to settle down some day and be a mechanic.  Rosasharon and Connie are a young couple who dream of owning their own home with a white picket fence and raising a family.  Casy used to be a preacher but lost his belief in God.  Out in California he discovers a new calling.  The kids Winfield and Ruthie I believe just represent innocence.<br /><br />Along the road they live day to day, dollar to dollar with the belief thatall they need to do is get to California and they would find salvation.  They meet many adversities along the road which they struggle to overcome.  By working together and making some new friends they manage to survive.  The whole country seems to be moving and change is in the air.  Route 66 is perfectly described, from the truck stop restaurants, to the broken down gas stations, we are shown different levels of haves and have nots.  The Joads do a little better job than some in maintaining their moral standards and beliefs but they see the road take it's toll on the people.<br /><br />After many tragedies and tribulations they finally arrive in California only to find that they were mislead.  California may be beautiful and the land fertile but it is all owned by greedy men, who don't want to share any of their wealth.<br /><br />A great number of people have been lured out west in order to produce a cheap labor force to pick crops.  With thousands of people fighting for just a few jobs they would accept lower wages just to keep from starving.  The people tried to turn to the government for help only to find more greed and corruption.  The government would only grant assistance to people who had been in the state for more than a year and the police were all either related to or paid off by the wealthy land owners who wanted to maintain the cheap labor force, so they kept the people moving so they couldn't obtain any lasting residency.<br /><br />People were living in make shift homes on the edge of town called Hoovervilles (after Herbert Hoover, president 1929-1933), until the cops came and forced them out.<br /><br />Even in desperation the people still tried to ban together to create their own rules and maintain their basic morals for what was acceptable, but they were being plagued on at every turn.  They still acted as men, but you could see their tolerance reach critical levels.<br /><br />Each chapter you could feel the tension rising as the people were beaten down and mistreated.  It was hard to believe the level of cruelty.  The rich were afraid of the poor people and thought they were going to take everything they owned so they treated them as less than human and gave them nothing.  The poor could only turn to other poor people for help since no one else seemed to care.  Throughout the book as the people reached a greater and greater level of desperation you wondered when they were going to break, but the human spirit seems to persevere.<br /><br />After all that transpires you are just amazed at the ability of these people to keep fighting and go on, and that gives you a little bit of hope.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this book.y would find salvation.

B000MRAAJW|3.0|Bought it, but it didn't play all my discs on the X-Box 360 HD-DVD. Just read reviewer who said you can download patch from x-box live. Only question is; why did some of the discs work without the patch and some didn't? Brilliant series though.....pity about the tech problems.
0321544080|4.0|It is obvious Joe Mcnally is an excellent photographer and, I'm sure, a good seminar instructor.  It has some insightful comments on shooting many different types of situations and assignments.  I guess I was looking for the kind of book Scott Kelby would write, providing more specific details on how the shots were taken.  It's probably only me and my expectations.  It still provided good insight and knowledge, and I would recommend the book as a source for words (and images) of inspiration.
B000X1Z0BU|4.0|I would call this a romantic drama....the story is for the most part autobiographical, as the 'actors' are actual musicians and are actually in a real-life relationship.  The story is basically this:  two struggling musicians meet each other and fall in love.  What makes this movie different from most is the genuine chemistry between the two and the great music they create together, as well as the age gap they have (he's 37, she's 20).  The plot of the film moves along well, and the viewer really cares for them as they grew in their affection for one another.  This is a must see, and the soundtrack is outstanding as well.  You will enjoy both.
B00111L0MY|5.0|I've been a fan of Dennis Lehane's private eye novels about Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro for years.  I keep wishing Lehane would write another book about them.  Instead, he's written a couple of stand-alone books that have become a movie (MYSTIC RIVER) and one that will become a movie (SHUTTER ISLAND).<br /><br />GONE, BABY, GONE stands out not only as the first Kenzie/Gennaro book to become a film, but is also Ben Affleck's first turn as a director.  His brother Casey (THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD) stars as Patrick Kenzie.<br /><br />Both the Afflecks grew up in Boston, and the choice to use Lehane's background for the series, Dorchester, was a no-brainer.  Ben Affleck, when drawn to the project, stated that he wanted to make that microcosm of Boston come to life on the screen, and he used several people from the neighborhood in roles.  In my opinion, he succeeds admirably.  The background has a unique feel and rhythm to it that he couldn't have gotten while shooting somewhere else.<br /><br />Another thing that really rings too is the language.  The dialogue is coarse and explosive, the way it tends to be in crowded metropolitan areas.  And no matter where you put them, areas of cities that are in disrepair always stand out and offer their own views of the world.  It doesn't matter if it's a small town or a large town, people tend to be desperate, trapped, and unhappy while living there.  Since they're not strong enough, mobile enough, or brave enough to take on people outside their neighborhood, the bad ones tend to prey on people inside the local environment.<br /><br />I liked the motivation for Patrick and Angie to get involved, the fact that Patrick knew the mother whose child was kidnapped.  They'd gone to high school together, and no one gets out of high school without a history and usually scars to show for it.  Angie is reluctant to get involved with the case because she doesn't want to find a dead kid, which is how things like this normally work out.<br /><br />If you've only watched the movie, you should really read the book as well.  Patrick and Angie's relationship means a lot to the book series, and in particular to this novel.  The movie can't pull in all the history or the emotional angst that is in the pages of the novel.  There's just not enough room.<br /><br />Patrick's investigation immediately puts him in harm's way of the police and the bad guys - which is exactly how a private eye story should operate.  The PI is always the man or woman outside of the world that needs to be investigated.  In this case, Patrick belongs to that world but he's stepped outside certain aspects of it.<br /><br />Although I knew the story and what was going to happen, it was great seeing Ben Affleck's vision of it and Casey Affleck's portrayal of Patrick.  The city seems almost to close in on the viewer, especially during the scenes where Bubba leads Patrick to the house where the kidnapped boy is being held by drug addicts and a child molester.<br /><br />Ed Harris turns in a fantastic performance as Remy Bressard.  I love watching Harris work anyway, but seeing him in this role was a pleasure.  Morgan Freeman, solid as ever, wasn't given too much to do, but he always shines.  Michelle Monaghan plays Angie Gennaro, but the focus is so much on Patrick that she almost gets eclipsed in everything.  She's so strong, though, that she seizes moments and makes them her own.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film.  I liked the look and the pacing, though some people may find it a little slow in places.  I was just glad to see this world come to life, and I think Ben Affleck did a marvelous job of doing that.  Hopefully other novels in the series will be developed as well.<br /><br />The plot twists and turns, but by the time everything gets sorted, there are hard choices to be made.  The great thing is that the viewer is forced to make those choices as well.  The subject matter is powerful and moving.
B000TX7B5U|1.0|I'm a huge SOAD fan, and always have been.  I own all of their albums, and I have to say, this solo record is horrible.  It sounds nothing like SOAD atall.  He tried to change, and it just took a nosedive.
B000WCBPOG|4.0|No offense to all the Beatles fans...but...their vocals suck!! omg!  I just finished listening to their music.  The lead singer does not know how to sing man!  Wonderful lyrics but damn.....why couldnt they find someone who could sing??<br /><br />im so glad the film Across the Universe was made.  What an improvement!!  Their voices make the songs a trillion times much better.  My favorite songs from the movie, because of both vocals and lyrics, are \\"While my Guitar Gently weeps\\", \\"Something\\", and \\"All you need is Love\\".  I'm not sure who created these lyrics because i was not there literally when they were made but they say John Lennon wrote most of them.  It doesn't really matter who did or how, what matters is that they were written.  Very beautiful.  though I'd rather buy the movie, the soundtrack is at a fair price....10 bucks....hmm....ehh.....sure ;)
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Also this movie finally came out on DVD in the Netherlands. A beautifull movie with great names as Pfeiffer and De Niro who even plays an fantastic caracater.   I/we really enjoyed this movie. It was magical and entertaining the same time. Everybody could watch this movie and be swept away with this story about finding true love even in an fairytail.  I give it 5* because I think even the actors in this movie enjoyed playing this fairytale. De Niro was entertaining and Pfeiffer was gorgious even when she was ugly.
B00104QSOM|1.0|I did plenty of standing! I stood up and walked right out, the movie was horrible! There was not plot, other than trying to come up with an \\"masterpiece\\", failed agian. Besides the movie being horrible the music blairing into my ears was horribe too. How can something this bad hold your attention for 3 hours? I left after two!!
B000GFLE1S|5.0|I saw Kinky Boots on satellite a few months back and knew I needed to add it to my collection.  Some folks will see the packaging and read the description and come to the conclusion that it's about drag queens... but it's not.  It's a brilliant, funny, heartwarming film about compassion, empathy, respect, understanding, and \\"changing your mind about someone.\\"  There's nothing in here that'll offend the kids - but it could awaken someone who may be living with their mind closed.    The soundtrack is great as well!
B000LE0THO|5.0|This is my favorite by ELO. Had it as an album when I was a teenager.
0802136834|5.0|I recieved this book in perfect condition and it came a day before the estimated time of arrival. Thank you.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|It was just like being at her show again in Vegas! I loved the extra footage to of the behind the scenes. I also bought one for my friend that is a huge fan. We are seeing Celine again on her World Tour!
B00004R99F|5.0|My daughter who is 3 1/2 years old almost 4 years old LOVES GOOFY, she will watch this movie over and over again, except she was getting alittle sassy from some of the scenes, so we had to stop watching it for a little bit. It is a cute show and as she gets older there are some good lessons in the movie.
B00004YYDI|5.0|This film has drama, great plot and intense action.  If you want a film that will keep in suspense than this film is for you.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I highly recommend this to everyone.  If you Love the Beatles you will Love this CD and DVD.  It is the most AMAZING Musical ever.  It was done so well that I just can't say enough about it. Just buy it you won't be disappointed.
0975991477|5.0|I love this guy. Some of the reviews further down come accross like primary school book reports. Lets not loose sight of the larger picture. What Bruce is shedding light on is a misunderstanding that costs trillions of dollars and millions of lives every year. It truly is one of the largest paradigm shifts in human history. When people come to fully understand this, disease and disharmony will be a think of the past, where they belong.    I LOVE YOU BRUCE! :o)
1594489505|5.0|You know how sometimes you hear all this hype about a book, and then you read it and think \\"Eh...\\"?  This is not one of those books - it was even better than I expected (even having read - and loved - The Kite Runner).  I'm a full-time student and I work full-time, and I still managed to read this in less than 24 hours.  Amazing...
0375714669|5.0|This is the only book that I have manged to read the entire of it in one day!  It is a comic book, supper easy read and very educational in terms of knowing different culture.  I like Persepolis 2 better than 1.   U may wanna watch the movie, as well. It won and nominated for many awards in 2007.
B00133KFGW|5.0|August Rush is a movie that will make you believe in love, miracles, and music. My favorite movie of all time.
0143038419|5.0|This book is one of those book that you remember for while and can imagine yourself to live in the story line.  I will tell u know that you would love these book if you :    1. Love traveling and adventure   2. Know or experienced Spirituality and practice of Yoga and Meditation  3. Experienced pain of love and hardship of renewing your life     I especially loved the section about Italy and Indonesia   and the fact that the book is a real journey of a lady to self discovery .    Eat,Pray,Love is one of the best book I've read after the Kite Runner and Da Vinci Code
075640407X|5.0|Once you've begun the story, you're hooked!  GREAT read! But knew I was in trouble when the number of pages were coming to an end but not the story... Please write faster!!
B0011FXLCC|2.0|Just a quick bit of input, I LOVE Goldfrapp as fun and often strange makers of danceable and toe-tap-able music. But I have to say I was a bit shocked and disappointed when I gave this album a once over. I bought it without hesitation, and without giving it a preview listen, which was probably not wise on my part. I pre-ordred it and couldn't wait to listen to it. I had just finished listening to Black Cherry and was really pumped, but this album is a total 180. It is mellow and low key and doesn't feature any danceable tracks. Not saying it's not beautifully performed and all that, but if you are expecting typical club-type Goldfrapp, well, you may want to skip this album and stick with Supernature and Black Cherry instead.
0525950079|4.0|Twas a good read.  Some characters seemed a redo from Pillars of the Earth (which is a GREAT book), and story line became very predictable, especially with main characters.  But I did enjoy it, would recommend.
B0007939NO|5.0|Brigadoon has some of the finest music and dancing Hollywood ever produced. This is a must see for fans of Cyd Charisse and Gene Kelly.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|This is how good live DVD-CD should sound, Wish George was around to hear it.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I just got done watching this and it's as good as I hoped it would be. It's the best acting by everyone on the show to date and the story/conclusion of the Ori's fate couldn't have been done better.    About the only two things I wish would have been done differently is 1)I kind of wish Richard Dean Anderson was in it but then maybe thats just because it's hard not to think about SG1 without him still. and 2) I wish the final fight was a little bigger between the accended beings but it was to the point.    I can't see any fan of the show not really liking this movie. A must buy for fans and I hope there will be more SG1 movies in the future.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|The work Disney did in restoring this was AMAZING!!  The colors were jumping off the screen and you could really appreciate all the artistry done 40 years ago.  The person I bought this for and I noticed the difference right away!  Even if you have the early DVD release of this movie, getting this copy is well worth it!!  If you are a fan of the movie, this DVD set is a must!  The characters and songs are even better than they were before!  I'm so glad that Disney is taking the time to restore these classics for a whole new generation!
B000TGJ80I|5.0|One of my favorite movies and on Bluray the picture is incredible. Yeah and Kate Beckinsale in the outfit sure doesn't hurt my eyes either.
0307394549|5.0|I pre-ordered my book and just received it today. There is a colorful picture for every cookie recipe. I just baked (pictured on the front cover) chewy chocolate Gingerbread cookies and the smell, texture and taste came out sensational. Honestly this is a book worth buying.
0810993139|5.0|Both my daughters (10 and 7) read through and totally enjoyed this book.  It's a quick read, with the cartoon images, and captures so many cute moments of childhood.
B000O75F7C|4.0|As a decided sceptic of the whole prog rock genre this album came as a revelation to me in that I found myself really enjoying if not all the music then at least a fair chunk of it and also the mental acuity and focus of the lyrics. The first song, the title track, is an excellent tune and my personal favourite.<br /><br />You see, to me prog was always a sad little genre. Mega-drugged up hippes waffling on in that much loathed 70's jam ethic style, lyrically incoherent and the entire form surviving on the crumbs left to it by the hard rock and heavy metal genre - seemingly the ony popular form of music that would let the uncool kid hang out with it.<br /><br />Now I've not totally gotten over that opinion but after listening again and again to this albums title track the nuances possible in this genre when it's coupled with focus got me seriously rethinking my gut instincts.<br /><br />Other tracks here such as the lyrically forlorn and musically mellow My Ashes further builds this album into an intellectually sturdy edifice. The theme is one of youthful alienation. A fertile field for sure and hardly a new idea but the way in which it's doggedly pursued through the album is a novel approach demanding the listeners respect. The songs segue from muscular riffs and prominent drumming to ethereal shading punctuated by acoustic guitar passages. Production by the band itself is crisp, clear and allows the album to breath - not every single nook and cranny is filled with noise.<br /><br />The dour attitude of the album may become a chore for some listeners and at 17:42 the track Anesthetize will test all but the most indulgent listeners. But thee is much on offer here, perhaps their next album will have more lightness of being, so to speak. And having put out an album of such considered examination of disaffected youth, touching on areas such as youth suicided, drug use and abuse and antipathy one can't help wondering if they regret naming themselves Porcupine Tree.
B000M58PJ6|2.0|It works fine but it drains batteries... I went through 2 nine volts in 2 days (expensive!). It unfortunately did not come with a 9v adapter so I'll have to go buy one or remember to take the battery out when I'm done...
0143039504|4.0|It was a good value and it's easy to read, with its margins and I love the texture of the paper.  My only negitive is, I'm not sure how long it will last but I hoping to get quality hard cover copies of each of her books so it doesn't have to last forever.
B000O77SOK|5.0|I began watching this show when it first aired and fell in love with it!!  I can't wait for the rest of the seasons to come out on DVD.  I would recommend this DVD for anyone who likes Boston Legal or Law and Order.  I hope that all who purchase this DVD are really enjoying it as I did.  One last thing pleasssseeee put more of the show on DVD!!
B0012K1ILW|5.0|this shiz is straight fyah right out of the box...  you gots ta listen real close for it to work...  otherwise your just wasting your time.  great cd, great lyrics, great talent from erykah badu as usual.    kinda futuristic and will probably be one of those cd's you can put on 8 years from now and it will be just as relevant then as it is now.      #7 is a real third eye opener.  i think they call that type of beat like glitch or glitch hop.      this is a great commuter cd that makes my drive all the more fun.    ~bbr
0385338724|3.0|I've been a fan of Sophie Kinsella's work since \\"Shopaholic,\\" and she definitely has a way of crafting a memorable heroine with a plucky sense of humor. In fact, she's my favorite of all the chick-lit writers (and I read more than my fair share).     However, this story lacks that certain sparkle that so many of her other books have had. Not only is it nearly impossible to suspend your disbelief in so many of the book's impossible situations, but I don't find myself relating with Lexi all that well. And it's not just the amnesia. It's practically everything about her.    It's so clear from the get-go that Eric is hardly the perfect husband. Yet there's so much build-up to the eventual breakup that I lost interest by story's end. Thankfully, there's a few engaging supporting characters and glimpses of Kinsella's usual humor to prevent \\"Remember Me?\\" from being utterly forgettable.    Looking forward to seeing what Kinsella comes up with next, though...someone as memorable as Becky Bloomwood, please?
0440241901|4.0|\\"Can you Keep a Secret\\" was entertaining and a book I couldn't put down. It was not a challenging read, but if you're up for a cute quite read with an underlying love story, this is for you!
B00005JPS6|5.0|I love the actor Jerry Seinfeld and when I found out that he was going to be in the movie ... I was really excited. The first time I watched I fell in love. Jerry was great in Seinfeld and now awed us once more with this great movie. All I have to say is \\"bravo Jerry\\", and I look forward to seeing if he stars in any other movies. I highly recommened this movie to anyone who wants alittle different storline to ants and bugs and penguines.<br />Well done Jerry!
B0015HZMB4|5.0|For fans of the book, the movie is a bit different, but from the beginning to the end, you will laugh and cry with Holly and her friends as she copes with the loss of her beloved Gerry, played amazingly by Gerard Butler. As usual.He never fails to hook the audience. This movie is a wonderful chick Flick. A definite Must See!!
B000PFU7OO|4.0|Once is an amazing movie, that everyone should see if they enjoy life, and the music of life.    The Once CD/Soundtrack does a wonderful job of capturing the spirit of the movie, but also the heart and soul of the music that is entwined in the movie from start to finish.    As you sit and listen to this CD, you'll cry when you hear Marketa sing of lost love, but then laugh when Glen sings about silly things (Hoover-Fixer-Sucker-Guy!).    It's a beautiful blending of tenderness and laughter and love and hopefulness.    Enjoy the songs...and the passion...but do it more than ONCE.    (Thanks to Ana for taking me to see the movie)
1400064287|5.0|For some reason I picked up this book thinking it was about marketing. Of course the principles and examples in this book apply to marketing professionals, to be sure, but this book is about communicating. When we communicate we do so through ideas. Some of those ideas remain with us and some do not. I remember hearing that eighty percent of all that is said over a pulpit is lost within a few short hours. But when thinking about the speeches, talk and presentations (in formal and informal settings) that I do remember and what has stuck with me it is clear that the presenter used the characteristics in this book, perhaps without knowing they were doing so. The six skills and habits good communicators employ are: Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional and Stories (SUCCESs). Each chapter is broken down to discuss one of these skills and there are drills to help the reader gain an understanding of the meaning and application of each skill. This book is for everyone as we all must communicate and can always learn to do so more effectively.
B000WMFZNS|5.0|This new disc edition is quality, transfer is faultless for an epic,5.1 dolby digital sound gives it an added extra, to this already great movie,this edition comes in a great limited edition package.
0743289684|5.0|This is a powerful book written from someone who has escaped the intellectual cage of Islam.  Every liberal should read this book and open their eyes to the danger that is coming.  There needs to be a serious discussion in every country about how to assimilate (if even possible) the backwards followers of Islam into the modern tenets of democracy. We can no longer turn a blind eye to women being beaten and oppressed, solutions thru violence instead of informed discussion, and 6000 female children a day having their genitals scraped off in the name of this so called god. I'm adding Ayaan to my list of personal heroes and I think you will too once you read this book.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|The title says it all, if you are interested in Megadeth, this is the pinnacle of their body of work.  If you are a Megadeth fan and do not own this album, then you need to review your \\"fan\\" status.  The band was at their technical and production peaks with Rust.  The previous albums are more gritty sounding and unrefined and Megadeth's later albums are almost overproduced and the songs were radio length.  Rust in Peace was a full blast thrash ride into head banger mania.  A must for any metal fan.
B000VKJ6VS|4.0|I have a love/hate relationship with iTunes. Cause I bought this album and it has like 12 tracks... and I'm like, awesome. Then I take a look at iTunes, and they have a bonus track! What do they mean a 13th track! And you can't buy that 13th track separately, you have to buy the whole album off iTunes in order to get that track. So I suggest that you buy it on iTunes instead.
B000YENUI6|4.0|Yup...this is about as \\"enjoyable\\" as a Cronenberg film is likely to get, complete with a (relatively) happy ending.  Of course there is still the obsession with graphic violence, blood, etc....but it is not done here simply to gross out the audience or to shock the viewer and it comes in very limited portions.  The performances are solid with none truly standing out over another--just believable all around.  The story is tight and kept short...Cronenberg doesn't let the story dwell too long in any one place and keepts things moving---something more modern directors should learn from...All in all a great piece of entertainment...
B0002IU988|5.0|I mainly got it for Metalingus, because I'm a huge wrestling fan, and that is Edge's entrance theme. But the rest of the album is not as hard core as Metalingus, but it is still wickedly sweet.
B000063UR1|4.0|An acclaimed environmental masterpiece, Silent running is set in a ruined future where huge orbiting spaceships preserve the last remaining trees from pollution and overcrowding on Earth.    In response to the environmental issues of the 1960's,special effects guru Douglas Trumbull married the theme of ecology to his pioneering effects simultaneously making a social statement and a beautiful film full of aesthetic opposites. His rendering of vast greenery trapped within steel and glass is a moving vision. Dern's unforgettable rendering of the unhinged Lowell, a man driven by what he thinks is right, is frightening and heartbreaking.     Silent Running eerily resembles our present environmental and social issues. The concern of environmental awareness is of course obvious and at the forefront of the film. There is also a fantastic speech given by Lowell to his crewmates that really emphasizes some of the social issues that we are facing perhaps more today than in 1972. When his fellow crewmates make fun of Lowell for eating raw fruit and vegetables he argues by asking them if they know where their food came from and better yet, what it actually IS that they are eating. He goes on to explain, passionately to the point of fist fighting, that at least he knows where his food comes from, that he grew it with his own two hands and that he garners much joy from his toiling. These arguments are similar to the present day wave of eco-groups calling for more responsible eating habits a.k.a. sustainable agriculture, which encourages communities to eat \\"closer to home\\" by buying direct from local farms, butchers, fisheries and so forth. It is also reminiscent of the classic argument of processed vs. organic food that is still raging on as this is written.     The effects are quite astounding for their time working well with the film rather than overpowering it. The only things that date this film badly are two songs sung by folk musician Joan Baez. While her musical styling isfitting for the socially conscious theme of the film, some may find it over the top and borderline laughable.    Never the less,  Silent Running is worthy of a place on your sci-fi DVD shelf, although you may want to see if there will be a high definition format (most likely Blue-ray) in the near future. Digital cleaning and sound enhancement could only serve to make
B000WTNCYA|5.0|I think Melody Gardot has one of the best voices I've heard in some time. Her songs and lyrics both are very likable and listenable. I like the entire CD and every song is enjoyable. In Worrisome Heart she calls her self a \\"modern day dame\\" which probably describes her well. I heard her first on XM radio and went out and sought her CD several months ago. I paid well over twice as much as what Amazon is selling this for now. So pick up this CD for yourself, can't beat the price.
0143038419|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert gives a no-holds-barred account of her life as she goes through her divorce, ends an unhappy affair, and seeks varied spiritual enlightenments in Italy, India, and Indonesia.  Ms. Gilbert, despite the angst through which she goes, tells her story with humor, pathos, and truth.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I am actually happy that I did not see this woderful flick in the theaters. I sang along to almost every song, which I think would have been irritating to those in the theater around me. Of course, I might have gotten free popcorn to eat to shut me up! Terrific story in the form of history of the 60's and 70's like Forrest Gump only even better. Great reason to buy HD and a BIG screen TV.
B000NQRR1Q|3.0|Roman Polanski is an uneven filmmaker. Somtimes he produces a great, original story that captures the imagination, as in [[ASIN:B0009X1MIW The Pianist: The Extraordinary True Story of One Man's Survival in Warsaw, 1939-1945]](2002) and [[ASIN:B000UAE7RW Chinatown (Special Collector's Edition)]] (1974). Other times, he manages to create creepy psychological drama, as in [[ASIN:B00003CXCF Rosemary's Baby]](1968) and [[ASIN:B000069I09 The Tenant]](1976). In fact, Chinatown continues to be one of my favorite newer film noirs, and Rosemary's Baby is the ultimate example of how to combine horror and humor in what is ultimately a scary movie.     But sometimes Polanski's films are just okay, as in [[ASIN:6305133476 Frantic]] (1988) and downright bad, as in [[ASIN:B000AAIC64 Pirates [Import]]] (1986). The Ninth Gate (1999) is one of those okay movies.     It's based on the book by Arturo Perez-Reverte called [[ASIN:015603283X The Club Dumas]], which was recommended to me by my friend J. Mark Bertrand. I loved it. The book was about a conniving book dealer who is researching two books at once--a lost version of a chapter by Dumas and another book called The Ninth Gate. What made Perez-Reverte's version great is the way that the main character, Corso, gets mixed up in both of them. By the end, it's almost as if he can't distinguish fantasy and reality, and so he ends up falling into several strange situations dealing with satanism and Dumas lovers. And they look a lot alike, too.    But Polanski removes all of the Dumas stuff and makes the movie solely about Corso and The Ninth Gate, a book supposedly ghostwritten by Lucifer. What he creates here is a creepy movie with a great character. Johnny Depp plays Corso as laid-back yet unscrupulous, and his acting fits the character superbly. For the first hour, the tension is taut and building. And then you learn what is actually happening, or at least what may be happening. And it goes downhill from there.    Sure the ending is left open, but it's not necessarily a good thing. Sure there is psychological drama. But by the end, I don't care anymore. The plot has become so ridiculous that I don't care about the characters or whether they manage to actually conjure the devil. And the movie incidentally features one of the stupidest sex scenes on film.    So all in all, it's an okay movie.
B000OPOANE|5.0|The Snakes & Arrows MVI is a thoroughly enjoyable viewing and listening experience!  I cannot say enough good about Rush.  Snakes & Arrows is a GEM.  I've been a fan for 31 years and really like this recording as much as anything they've done.  (This coming from a Hemispheres fanatic).  Honestly, I thought the live presentation of Snakes & Arrows that I witnessed in July of 2007 in NJ was more fresh, fun and exciting than the older tunes I've enjoyed over the (many) years.  Just fantastic music.<br />Let's hope Rush continues to provide more of the behind the scenes footage (thanks to photographer extraordinaire Andrew McNaughton) on future recordings.<br />Two drumsticks up from moi.
1400031524|4.0|Henning Mankell is undoubtedly the Agatha Christie of Sweden - a very good, competent author of crime and suspense novels.  His writing style is sparse, but very effective, and as a suspense novel, this story will grip you and keep you reading until the last page.  At least, it kept me glued to the story to the last page.  As a history of the events in the Baltic states, especially Latvia, it is not so convincing.  Several grievous errors crop up, and it is quite unbelievable that a policeman, even from a small Skåne town, would be so ignorant of the history and situation in the Baltics.  Even in the turbulent times of the 1988-1991 'Singing Revolution', There was no question who the ultimate authority was in Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania.  To pretend that Latvians had any real say-so in their country is not realistic, even by a Swede.  It is true that Sweden was practically the only western country to recognize the incorporation of the Baltic States into the Soviet Union, but it also had a sizeable diaspora of Estonians and Latvians, some of whom moved in fairly high circles of the Swedish government.  Any halfway-educated Swede knew the situation across the Baltic Sea.  And any Swedish policeman sent to coordinate criminal investigation in the former Soviet Union should, and would have been briefed by the foreign ministry before being allowed to go.  So, in reading the book, be enthralled by the mystery, but do not take the history and explanation of the political scene all too seriously.
B0002IQHY8|1.0|I was thrilled when I heard that a new Alan Parsons disc was on the way.  It had been 5 years since \\"The Time Machine\\" came out, and that was, in my opinion, the best work he'd done since some of the better Alan Parsons Project albums.  So I bought \\"A Valid Path\\", popped it in the player, and, ouch!!!!  I'm sorry, but this disc it just doesn't contain the Alan Parsons sound I know and enjoy.<br /><br />\\"A Valid Path\\" is heavy duty electronica through and through.  Granted, APP has always had a strong component of electronica, but in this effort electronica has overwhelmed the music.  Um...it's like going to a movie where it's obvious that the producers were more interested in what they could do with digital effects than with plot development.<br /><br />If you are a long-time Parsons fan you may not not like this offering.  The only way I really knew it was a Parsons release was that the disc contained some electrocuted (er...re-engineered) tracks from earlier releases: Mammamgamma '04, A Recurring Dream Within a Dream...<br /><br />If you are looking for traditional APP-style music DO NOT LOOK HERE, Alan Parsons has gone off in a new direction.<br /><br />OK, with that said, please keep in mind that these comments were made from the perspective of someone looking for more Alan Parsons music after the manner of APP.  Since that was the case, I was hit with a double whammy - not APP style music, and a heavy dose of, at least to me, uninspired electronica overkill.<br /><br />If I were to rate the songs on a scale of 1-5 stars, the best one would earn perhaps a 3 - \\"More Lost Without You.\\"  The rest of the songs rated only 1 or maybe 2 stars each.  This is, in my opinion, the low point of the Parsons discography.  I do not begrudge anyone from following their chosen path, it's just not what I'd come to expect over the preceeding 13 releases.<br /><br />Over all, I give this disc 2 stars for the music, and 1 star for negative shock value.  Shock value wins - 1 star from a 30+ year APP and Alan Parsons fan.
B000000XB9|5.0|I got my first copy of this when I was in high school and 14 years later I still listen to it fairly regularly.  Apparently Fogerty was a California boy and not the bayou brat he comes across as in many of his songs.  No matter, his imagination was pretty extraordinary at that time and you will believe in his storytelling regardless of the facts.  Nobody did the fierce young man rockabilly blues like John Fogerty in his prime.  If you don't have this disc you need to get it and that's no lie.  All it's really missing is the midnight special though they had other decent songs.  Driving around late at night in the hills of southern Indiana as a teenager listening to this music was a transformative experience that I wish everyone would have.  Okay I'll stop now.      Favorite tracks, Lookin' out my Backdoor, Bad Moon Rising, Fortunate Son,  Have you Ever Seen the Rain, Someday Never Comes!, Okay I'll stop again :)

B00004YX39|5.0|Having previously enjoyed Steely Dan exclusively on the radio, it's been a blast to get into their albums.  I was under the mistaken impression that everything they've done sounds great, but essentially the same.  Yes, they have a distinctive sound, but the variety on GAUCHO is impressive.  When I'm not distracted by the funny, sardonic lyrics, the title track is actually a thing of great beauty.  I sometimes wish it were in a foreign language so I could just soak in the gorgeousness of the unexpectedly hymnlike melodic turns and chorus.  Overall, superb musicianship, instrumentation and arrangements reveal multiple layers and details that paint lovely, funky sound pictures.  I don't know the personal sagas of Becker and Fagen, so I can't comment on the cynical, funny lyrics other than to say that nobody does cynical and funny better than Steely Dan.  Even when I have no idea what the hell they're talking about, I'm seduced by the sophisticated synchronicity of music and lyrics.  \\"Time Out of Mind\\" is an uplifting gem enhanced by the guitar of Mark Knopfler, \\"Third World Man\\" is sad and sinister with a bit of Dylanish inflection, \\"My Rival\\" makes me laugh even as I'm bopping to the groove, \\"Hey Nineteen\\" is funny in the way only self-mockery can be -- and all of it sails along with some of the best hooks in the business.  Hope I don't sound like a cliche, because GAUCHO sure doesn't.  What took me so long?  Better late than never...
B0013ND30M|5.0|5 STARS (HIGHEST RATING):  THE MOVIE, THE MONEY, & THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY DVD:<br /><br />\\"Sleeping Beauty\\" (1959) marked a stunning departure from the usual \\"house style\\" of animation at Disney Studios. The Disney Version, principally designed by artistic genius Eyvind Earle, is most definitely set in an enchanted, 14th Century, Medieval Kingdom. Earle gets his own DVD featurette entitled \\"Eyvind Earle: The Man And His Art.\\"<br />  Legend has it that \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" took six years to create (but according to the new 2008 \\"Picture Perfect: The Making Of Sleeping Beauty\\" DVD Documentary, the film was actually in various stages of development for nearly a decade) at a cost of $6 Million Dollars. And, for once, you can see every penny up on the screen. (The 2008 DVD release has an even \\"wider\\" Widescreen aspect than the 2003 release). Everything is so detailed and lush, it adds up to an addictive movie experience that invites multiple viewings. Pefection came at a heavy price; both financially and personally. Walt Disney himself spared no expense to have Tchikovsky's stirring musical score recorded at a Stereophonic Studio in Germany, and that had nothing to do with the actual animation! Upon first release, the film made an impressive $3 million, but that was only half its cost. Nevertheless, the film won prophetic and instant praise as \\"an unmatched vision of pagentry and adventure.\\" Certainly, the film has now made back its cost with theatrical re-issues, video, DVD, and Blue-Ray releases.<br />  Many artists in addition to Eyvind Earle labored on \\"Sleeping Beauty.\\" Sequence director Eric Larson worked on the infamous Sequence 8 (Princess Aurora meets Prince Phillip in the forest) for well over a year. When that sequence alone cost $10,000 Disney fired Larson from \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" and put him to work on \\"101 Dalmations.\\" Disney later told Larson that animated features  (Once, Disney's bread and butter) were just too expensive and might well bankrupt the studio.<br />  By the mid-1950's, Walt Disney's time and interests were occupied with opening Disneyland theme park, live-action movies and \\"The Mickey Mouse Club\\" TV Show.\\" Disneyland opened in 1955. In 1957, Walt Disney was wise enough to promote \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" with a park attraction two years before the film's release. The original \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" Attraction is recreated as a \\"Virtual Walk-Through\\" DVD Bonus Feature.<br />  Disney was determined not to (exactly) repeat his own fairy-tale past. Although visually sophisticated, the film tells the story in straightforward fashion. \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" is blessedly free of the \\"comic bits of business, tricks\\" and \\"story padding\\" found in \\"Snow White\\" and \\"Cinderella.\\" Three tiny good faeries  named Flora, Fauna and Merriweather attempt to save Princess Aurora from the curse of \\"Mistress Of All Evil\\" Malificent, voiced with  chilling authority by Eleanor Audley (who also voiced Lady Tremine, the abusive Stepmother of \\"Cinderella\\"). A nice case of \\"mistaken identity\\" is also employed in the narrative. When Phillip  (voiced by Bill Shirley) and Aurora meet in the forest, he thinks she is a peasant girl. Aurora falls in love with him not knowing that he is the Prince she has been betrothed to since birth. Indeed, she (going by the name Briar Rose) does not yet know she is really Princess Aurora at all. While the \\"Prince Charmings\\" in \\"Snow White\\" and \\"Cinderella\\" are bland afterthoughts; essentially footnotes to the plot, Prince Phillip takes an extremely active role in saving both Aurora and his Kingdom from Malificent. She hisses, \\"Now you shall deal with me, Oh Prince, and all the Powers Of HELL\\", as she transforms herself into a fire-spewing dragon. What follows is one of the most thrilling and nightmarish battles of good vs. evil in cinema history. Prince Phillip just barely survives, but he emerges as a strong and hunky hero we can be proud. True, Aurora herself takes a back seat to the faeries, Malificent, and Prince Phillip. But critics who complain about Aurora's secondary role should remember that, in the original fairy-tale, the title Princess does FAR LESS! Whereas Snow White is depicted as an innocent child, Aurora is very much a lovely young woman who is clearly ready for the romance she longs for. And she is beautifully voiced by soprano Mary Costa.<br />  Animators John Lasseter, Andreas Deja, and \\"Entertainment Tonight's\\" Leonard Maltin provide  lively and informative Audio Commentary that is far superior to the grim and dreary tone of the Commentary on the 2003 DVD release. Among other things, we learn that Eleanor Audley initally turned down the choice role of Malificent because she was battling tuberculosis. Fortunately, she eventually  felt better enough to do the voice recordings. \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" was also the last feature to be completely drawn, inked, and painted by hand. Afterwards, the Studio moved to the less expensive Xerox process for the modern-day story of \\"101 Dalmations.\\"<br />  I find \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" to be an absolutely  hypnotic and mesmerizing film; one that should be cherished forever. On the occasion of its 50th Anniversary, I hope it is finally regarded as  an apex in animation and the Crown Jewel of Disney's fairy-tale features.<br />\\"Sleeping Beauty\\" is one of a kind, and the last one of its kind.o complain about Aurora's secondary role should remember that, in the original fairy-tale, the title Princess does FAR LESS!

B0012YRTJ8|1.0|Obviously, the author has a right-wing axe to grind.  His methods are flawed.  Through oblique argumentation, ad hominems, guilt by association, non sequiturs, and latent prejudice, the author attempts to swiftboat Candidate Obama.  His motives are transparent.  There's fodder here for a smear campaign, but little else of value, unless you're out of Presto logs.  Heslop should probably stick to accounting.
B00006AVRK|5.0|I first saw a clip of \\"Jeeves and Wooster\\" on the internet. After seeing several more clips, my wife and I gambled and bought the set. We are quite happy with it and consider it to be in the same vain as the old \\"Fawlty Towers\\" series. Set in the 1920's, Bertie Wooster (Laurie) is an upper class gentleman who is continually getting himself in a predicament and Jeeves (Fry) his manservant works his magic to make sure his gentleman gets through the various situations unscathed and saves the day. There is a lot of drinking and throwing of bread rolls in the gentleman's club too.

006135323X|5.0|[[ASIN:1432719300 Purposefully Made]] It's up to us to choose what works. I'm glad that this book is here. I encourage you to read it.
0765316889|5.0|I, unlike a lot of readers here, enjoyed this one more than the first, slightly. Yes, Kelsier's gone, but the crew has enough charisma to keep reader's attention. Another review suggested this novel to be a \\"YA Novel\\", which to some extent I agree. As a \\"new\\" writer, Sanderson has yet reached the levels of Jordan, but his plots and twists overshadow the shortcomings. The storyline continues to be intriguing and well thought out. I think the twist in this book is on a greater scale than the first book. With some books, you can see where it will be going but with this one, it's quite unexpected. The political warfare is entertaining to me, but it could use more stategic warfare action. I also liked the mystery and suspense levels of this book. It keeps the reader wondering and thinking. When a book makes me sweat like this one and gasping at times, then I realize how entrenched it makes one feel. The ending is some what a cliff hanger, and that's the only gripe I have with this book. I have a lot of mixed feelings regarding this book, but overall it is a great great read and I truly recommend it. Otherwise, I cant wait for the finale, but at the same time, I dont want it to end. Sanderson created something great and I expect and hope that his future series will be longer and more powerful.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|not only is this rare jewel (rare in germany) in itself in excellent condition, speedy delivery, etc., but one of the funniest and darkest series ever. The biggest question, how did this ever get through prude US censorship and could actually be broadcasted in the U.S. Maybe there is still hope that not only cheap trash invades our living-rooms.
0765350386|4.0|A well paced read. At first I didnt think I was enjoying the book but something kept me going and wanting more. The more I read, the later I stayed up at night and finding it hard to put down. I thought the ending was a little weak, and had the feeling of \\"Huh?.. that's it?!\\" That's how its done? I was trying to find plot holes because I was so expecting more.  However, I let it go and accepted it for what it was, feeling really satisfied at the same time wanting to read the sequel immediately. The action sequence wasnt detailed enough, imo. I also liked the way this book isnt a fantasy cliche. I suspect most people will find this an entertaining book. Definitely worth your time!
0553382179|5.0|This book has changed my life!  Who knew things could be so calm in my life?  After reading and implementing the \\"Baby steps\\", I really learned to fly. I am still learning and loving every minute of my new life! I have given this book as a gift and have recommended it to all of my friends!  Buy it now! You wont be sorry!

159562015X|2.0|I was disappointed by this book.  I gained very little value or insights from it.  The online test revealed nothing beyond what I've already learned through basic HR testing at my current job.    If you have never taken any sort of PAPI or skills inventory testing before, you might find a benefit in the online test.  However, I suspect there are more valuable inventories available on the web FOR FREE.  You just have to google around a bit to find them.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|What can I say. I like some of the pop I hear on the radio and Love Song was what drew me to Sara Bareilles. I then checked out a few of her videos on the internet and found something much deeper to this artist.    I bought the CD and I have to admit I love it more with each listen. There are times I hear a bit of Sarah McLaughlin, some Beth Neilsen Chapman, some Ricki Lee Jones. In all while she may remind me of others she has a unique sound all her own that draws you in with the strength of her voice and song writing.    Don't count on much else being a hit on the radio but get this album for what the substance it has to offer beyond a catchy hook.

B00003CX8V|5.0|If Billy Wilder had only directed Double Indemnity, Some Like It Hot, and The Apartment, he would be entitled to a high seat in the Hollywood Hall of Legends.  Although very different in character and atmosphere, all three films bear Wilder's unmistakable stamp and showcase his mastery of his art. As with Some Like It Hot, Wilder's co-writer here was I.A.L. Diamond.    It's hard to believe today that The Apartment was viewed as alarmingly racy becuase of its casual treatment of marital infidelity and an undeniable form of, well, executive procurement - today these issues, by themselves, wouldn't raise a yawn.  It's a tribute to the Wilder way of presenting the foibles of humanity that you watch with a grin.  Jack Lemmon plays ambitious clerk and lonely bachelor C.C. Baxter - a small cog in the big wheel of the American Insurance Company - he works on the 19th floor but wants badly to work his way up to the 27th (the \\"Executive Floor\\").  He's found a quick stepping-stone: the key to his apartment on West 67th St., a walk-up in one of those ancient brownstones just off Central Park West that probably looks exactly the same today as it did in 1960.  His married superiors on the 27th floor, a group of aging mid-level executives bored with their jobs, wives, and homes in the suburbs, amuse themselves by picking up girls and taking them to Baxter's little flat after work.  Baxter has quite a job keeping their schedules tidy and carving out time for himself in his own home.    News of this convenient love-nest has reached the Big Cheese on the 27th floor, Jeff Sheldrake, a serial philanderer who has cut a large swath through the company's young, single employees.  Sheldrake's current amusement is pretty elevator girl Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine) who has fallen hopelessly in love with Sheldrake even though she knows that he will never leave his wife, two children, and nice home in White Plains for her.  As it happens, the attractive Kubelik has caught the eye of most ofthe men at the company, including Baxter, although his interest in her is more than merely physical.  When Sheldrake demands the key to Baxter's apartment, in return for promoting Baxter up to his own office on the 27th floor, Baxter has no idea that it is Fran that Sheldrake will be entertaining.    Until, that is, Baxter comes home on Christmas Eve to find Fran passed out in his bedroom, having taken the sleeping pills she found in Baxter's medicine cabinet after her evening with Sheldrake, during which Sheldrake made his intentions (or rather, the lack thereof) toward her clear.    From then on, Baxter's ambition struggles with his better nature and his developing love for Fran, as Fran's obsession with Sheldrake begins to crumble under her growing contempt for him and her dawning realization that life just might hold something better for her, after all. Along the way, the viewer is treated to views of corporate life in the early 1960s,  peopled by a host of entertaining supporting characters, by turns hilariously and viciously played by stars such as Ray Walston, David White, Jack Kruschen, and David Lewis.  Edie Adams makes the most of a small but sharply etched portrayal of Miss Olsen, Sheldrake's secretary and one of his past flings, who gets the shaft but manages to send it back to its owner in fine style before she flounces out the door in her faux-leopard hat and pointy glasses.    Jack Lemmon is wonderful as the schnook who turns out to have more backbone than his contemptuous superiors supposed; Shirely MacLaine is enchanting as Fran; and Fred MacMurray makes a smooth, cold-hearted cad - his best scene is the one in which he makes it clear to Baxter that if Baxter wants to move up at American Insurance, he has to hand over that key.  MacMurray wasn't happy with the public response he got for playing Sheldrake - by 1960, Double Indemnity was well in MacMurray's past and his screen persona had moved into kinder, gentler material like \\"My Three Sons\\".  After The Apartment, MacMurray forsook negative roles for the rest of his acting life.    The Apartment, released in 1960, offers bittersweet charm, plenty of the Wilder brand of cynicism, a witty script, a flawless cast, and a sophisticated, nostalgic score by Adolph Deutsch whose primary theme went on to be a hit for the Ferrante & Teicher orchestra.  The film won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. The Apartment is a classic by a master, and a mark of its quality is that while the styles of dress and the look of corporate America may have have changed, the film's observations about human relationships have not dated at all.
B00003CXMG|5.0|I just love this movie.  What a great coming-of-age tale.  Patrick Fuget is superb as a naive, innocent yet brilliant young man trying to break into the crazy world of rock journalism.  In fact, the entire casting of this film was serendipity.  Each actor, from Billy Crudup to Frances McDormand, gave an amazing, heartfelt performance.<br /><br />I have always enjoyed Cameron Crowe's movies, but in my opinion nothing he has done before or since has approached the brilliance of this, his life story.  This is in my top ten.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|A \\"reel\\" feel good movie.  The gorgeous guy gets the adorable girl.  They write and sing together forever.  This music is snappy and reminiscent of the 80's.  Could have used the Eagles closing song to round out the cuts, but all in all enjoyable.  Hugh and Drew.....funny together!
B00003CWL6|5.0|As evidenced by the many stellar reviews, this is a great, great film.  The fact that it is so enormously popular speaks to the quiet desperation many of us sometimes feel in our mundane, humdrum lives...where most of your time is spent doing stuff you are obligated to do, not what you really want to do.<br /><br />From the exterior, Kevin Spacey's character has a good job, a great house, a beautiful wife and a loving daughter.  The fact is, he's miserable. I love how he is sick of keeping up appearances.  I love how he decides to live life the way he wants to - telling his boss to buzz off, buying his dream car, working out and smoking pot - it's brilliant.  If a lot of people were brave enough, they would probably admit that they might like to go on a similar adventure.<br /><br />In short, the way the tale unfolds is sheer brilliance.  The end is shocking and surprising, and very powerful.  This is mandatory movie watching for any film buff.
006135323X|3.0|The book is a fun read -- mostly Dan experiments on MIT students and shows how people make decisions that are different from what standard economic theory assumes. The experiments are interesting and seem well designed -- the main problem I have with the book is that Dan takes these tightly controlled, very focused results and suggests that they are generalizable enough for him to recommend sweeping policy changes that would fix our healthcare system, consumer debt and teen pregnancy. After a while I took to reading the experiments and skipping over his rather broad interpretations of what they mean.<br /><br />Anyway, I read a lot of this sort of soft-non-fiction and usually end up forgetting all the experiments described, so I've taken to making notes. The ways in which people behave irrationally may be useful reference material for me in the future :) You can read my completely unedited notes here: [...]
0743496736|4.0|I haven't been able to stop thinking about this book. After reading the first 60 pages, I couldn't sleep all night. I had bad dreams, and then would wake up and think about the book and think about what I would do in a similar situation. I found myself planning how I would save my students and me if this were to happen in my classroom. Then, as the story unfolded, my preceptions changed. One thing I love about Jodi Picoult is that she takes a controversial issue, and when she's done, you don't know what to think anymore! I alternated between hating Peter and feeling sorry for him, for liking him! Then I'd say to myself, You're feeling sorry for a murderer?! I did the same with Drew, Matt, and Courtney. I would hate them one moment, then feel sorry for them another minute. As a teacher in a middle school, I wonder if there are Peters in my classroom?? Am I missing the Drews, the Courtneys, and the Matts?? What's going on under my nose in the hallways and in the classroom? Picoult has given me much to think about.  But why 4 stars instead of 5?? I didn't think the ending was as revealing as some of the endings to past books.
B000Y8GFY8|2.0|I love her albums Black Cherry and Supernature that I own on cd along with the single cd Number One that has two bonus tracks but this album strays away from them completely. I gave it two stars not to say it sucks or anything or that I didn't like it. It's just I can't get into it. I think this is the follow up to her Felt Mountain album that's practically done the same way.    Maybe when she comes out with another album like the two above that I love alot I will jump to get. I was so into wanting this new album untill I sampled the songs and found that it is not techno dance like. I said \\"I'll pass!\\"    No hard feelings Goldfrapp it's not my glass of chocolate skim milk. :)

B000ZLFALI|2.0|I had little desire to see this movie, but based on a rave review from a best friend decided to be open minded.  I must say that I definitely should have followed my first instinct.  The music was fantastic and for those who love Beatles music as I do, will not be disappointed.  The movie however was a completely different story.  This movie was extremely drawn out with little flow and just plain boring.  I watched this with my 16 year old and she couldn't wait to watch.  When the movie was over, we looked at each and said \\"Thank goodness that's over.\\"  Not a reaction I was expecting.    I can say that I would be tempted to purchase the soundtrack, but know without a doubt that the movie will not make my collection.
B00005MP58|4.0|I have not read the book, so I cannot compare the two as such. I can only guess that it is adequate and for the most part faithful since sooo many people agree. I can however compare this to the 2005 movie version. Personally, I liked the newer one better. I am not sure if I am biased since I saw that one first. I just though it felt fresh and lively. And Kiera as Lizzie did a much better job than the actress in this mini-series. That is not to say I dislike this version. On the contrary, I found it intriguing and never dull, even at the 6 hour length. I absolutely adored Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. He was perfection and my favorite part of the mini-series.   The costumes were lovely to look at as well as the scenery. The soundtrack was lacking however, I barely even noticed it while watching. Despite the lack of certain qualities that I thought were abundant in the newer version, this is a solid period piece and anyone who is a lover of such films should watch this.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|I love the Beatles and I love Cirque Du Soleil. I haven't seen this show, but I believe the remixed music would be a tremendous background for their acrobatic arts.     As a music album divorced from its stage performance, I can't be very enthusiastic. The remixes are very clever. There are some very amusing juxtapositions between instruments recorded for one song added to a new mix of a different song. But I don't find these new creations having the power of the originals. Still, this is an artistic judgment and many will disagree, thinking the new equal or surpassing the original albums we have known and loved.     On a purely sonic level, it was a disappointment to me. I expected greater clarity and dynamics, since George Martin's son went back to the multitrack tapes used to mix the master tapes of the original albums. That is one analog generation closer to the source, and ought to be that much clearer.     In an effort to make sounds from two different songs meld into one, and trying to make all the songs have a similar sonic signature, it appears that the high frequencies have been somewhat rolled off, and the dynamics reduced a bit. It is all very homogenous from one track to the next, but I thought the end result was less immediate in most cases, less \\"alive\\" than the tracks on the original LPs and CDs we are so familiar with.    As a soundtrack for a Cirque stage production, I'd have to give it a full five stars. I believe it is perfectly suited to the task for which it was created. The new mixes brought something new, creative, viable, a great canvas on which to paint with color and movement of the wonderful Cirque Du Soleil performers.     As an attempt at remixing and remastering that helps us hear more detail in those vocals and instruments laid on tape in the 1960s, it is not very successful. Sometimes you can hear more of a particular instrument because it is mixed far right or left, away from the other instruments in the sonic soundstage. But that'sa rare occurrence. And it honestly doesn't sound very clear. It sounds homogenized, like what compressing a CD to a low bitrate MP3 will do to the sound quality.     I don't think this album will have any lasting value for me. I listened through it, hearing all the very familiar melodies and instrumental parts, being somewhat amused. But not amazed. To me it is a curiosity, and perhaps a bitter reminder that what I really crave are remastered versions of the original albums that preserve all the detail and dynamics possible, without altering the proper balance between all the individual sound elements. In short, something that gets us closer to the original master tape.

0452289963|5.0|After reading The Power of Now, I was already very intrigued with Eckhart Tolle's perspective on all things spiritual.  This book blows that one out of the water.  This combines the wisdom & teachings found in books by such contemporary authors as Wayne Dyer, Gary Zukav, & Thomas Moore and conveys it in an amazingly clear and concise manner.  Tolle's gift lies in the simplicity he lends to all that he illuminates.  Can't recommend this highly enough.  I would especially encourage Christians to read this book as it takes one beyond the boundaries of religion and into the deeper realms of individual and planetary collective conciousness- mankind's potential salvation.  \\"Evolve or die.\\" :)

B00005JKG7|5.0|John Carpenter's \\"The Fog\\" is one of those movies that traumatized me in my youth.  Legit scares, great atmosphere, and frightening protagonists, \\"The Fog\\" is a must have for horror fans.<br /><br />With the ususal cast of Carpenter dependables, the story is masterfully woven during the celebration of a town's founders.  But a local priest, played by Hal Holbrook, discover the sinister origins of the town, and the reason for the peculiar fog bank and paranormal activity in the city.<br /><br />To this day, this movie still provides chills and scares for me almost 25 years later.  The soundtrack provided by Carpenter is the key to the scares, in my opinion.

B00102F5WK|5.0|After all the hype about its poor box office receipts, I was wary about a serious political film starring LEGALLY BLONDE's Reese Witherspoon, or another sensationalist \\"rendition\\" of what American movies make of torture.    But the script is particularly intricate and intelligent, with a wonderful twist.  Sorry it didn't catch fire for the amazon reviewer, but the restraint with which this film treats the subject is responsible and works well.      Especially since--despite the director's political position--the script does harken back to the early years of LAW AND ORDER, when the strongest arguments of all sides of an issue were voiced.

B00023B1LC|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />I am late getting on the \\"Bourne\\" bandwagon. I just watched the first two films in the series for the first time last weekend after years of avoiding them. My impression? That so far, the \\"Bourne\\" films deserve all of the praise and success that they've received.<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Identity\\" manages to take a story with a myriad of cliches (the super spy, the spy with amnesia, secret government experiments and cover-ups, etc, etc, etc) and still make a film that's fresh, exciting, intelligent and engrossing.<br /><br />So the question is, why does this film excel when so many other action films fall flat? First, the film utilizes an excellent cast. Matt Damon as Jason Bourne is the thinking man's action hero, bringing a complexity to the role that flies in the face of the typical cocky, wisecracking American action hero. Veteran actors like Chris Cooper and Brian Cox bring gravitas to their supporting roles, and Franka Potente brings an international, quirky sex appeal to her role as Jason's love interest.<br /><br />As great as the performers are, the script and direction also really deliver. Although the action scenes are all wonderfully executed, the film makes sure not to sacrifice character development either. Jason Bourne is a man who has lost his identity, and as a result is able to regain the humanity he has clearly lost in his previous life as an assassin.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|A very funny British farce about family dysfunction, death, and the range of human emotions/foibles.  Watching without a laugh track or a theatre audience, not every gag is immediately obvious.  But relax and go with the story -- it grows more and more amusing, with a touching ending.  Please be sure you like British-style humor; this isn't in-your-face slapstick and dick jokes (but there is significant scatalogical humor).  Excellent cast, direction, and storyline all around.  We actually watched it twice and enjoyed it even more on the second run.  Very fun.

B000ETQPYM|2.0|The main theme in this book is about coping with the loss of a loved one, in this case Holly's husband Gerry, who died prematurely due to a terrible illness.  I shall not go through the whole synopsis as many of the reviewers have done so before me and the book description above is also explanatory.  At the risk of sounding unpopular (I see many voted with 5 stars) my own 2 stars refer to what I think was a poorly executed book.  The concepts of loss and love are interesting and some of the ensuing situations are even described humorously despite the sad main subject.  However all the characters, with the exception of Holly perhaps, are underdeveloped, most descriptions repetitive and the storyline predictable at best.      Perhaps my negativity about this book is due to the fact that I was expecting not Shakespeare certainly, but something more maturely written, as it belongs to one of the `adult' categories of Amazon.  I think that the age target here is between 15 / 20 year-olds.  Nothing wrong with that however.  If you are reading me and you fall into that age group, I think you might enjoy it much more than I did.

It's a must read for anyone that appreciates good books and great writing.
B000001GX8|5.0|If you enjoy a quintessentially Viennese production of *Figaro*, then this recording is for you.  B&ouml;hm leads a performance that consistently uplifts for its geniality, elegance and charm.  This is a heartwarming rather than a sizzling account of the score, though B&ouml;hm's tempos do not strike me as excessively slow (as they did another reviewer on this website).  Indeed B&ouml;hm can convey enormous vitality when the occasion demands--as in the Act II Finale.  He also manages to get crisp and committed playing from his Viennese forces (nothing routine here).  Few listeners will be able to resist B&ouml;hm's ideal combination of pathos and serenity in the great reconciliation scene of the Act IV Finale; this may be B&ouml;hm's finest moment on record.<br /><br />But it is chiefly for the singing that I am always drawn back to this version.  Arguably this is the finest cast ever assembled for a studio recording of the opera.  Janowitz' Countess can seem cool at first, but the sheer beauty of her voice--silvery, angelic, like something one might hear in Galadriel's mythic realm--and the consistent perceptiveness of her characterization cannot be gainsaid.  Opposite her, Fischer-Dieskau overacts as usual--sometimes distractingly playing the buffoon--but his commanding manner and intelligent way with the text make this otherwise slimy character unusually sympathetic, even noble.  One believes every word of his penetential plea in Act IV--while remaining disposed to forgive him for any future lapses!  Prey is a virile, at times overly serious Figaro who plays up the revolutionary subtext.  One could wish for a bit more \\"smile in the voice\\" but with a singer as gifted as he, one is not disposed to complain.  As his consort, Mathis is a pert and perky Susanna, sexy where she needs to be, believably scheming, and most movingly standing by her man  (Figaro -- or the Count?) in \\"Deh, vieni non tardar.\\"  Best of all is Troyanos' Cherubino.  I have never heard a more convincing portrayal of this terminally randy adolescent. Her agile and believably boyish voice is a perfect fit  for the part; no matronly mezzo she.  The comprimarios are everything they should be, with the possible exception of a \\"grandmatronly\\"  Marcellina.  Their Act IV arias, included here, do prove to be too much of a good thing too late in the game.  If I were conducting *Figaro*, even for a recording, I would omit these arias (which suffer by contrast to the other, truly great, arias in Act IV) if only for the sake of preserving dramatic continuity.  But listeners can, of course, choose to include them or program them out.<br /><br />The remastering is a success.  The sonics, which always were crisp and clear, are smoother than on LP, though there is a hint of peaking here and there.  One might wish for a tad more warmth, but with superbly balanced orchestral textures and vocal ensembles, I count the engineering to be far more of an asset than a liability.  I notice that used copies of this set are being offered for astonishingly low prices on this website; don't hesitate, then, to acquire a *Figaro* with all the classic virtues and an unbeatable cast.vincing portrayal of this terminally randy adolescent.

B0001VV1GK|4.0|We have the plan toy 110 piece train set on a train table in our house. I purchased this garage set for my son for his birthday and he really enjoys it. It does take up 1/4 of the space on a regular train table though. I didn't anticipate it (even with the measurements given) being as large as it is. It does make the $60 price tag make a lot of sense too.<br /><br />I love the durability and build of the set. Only one car comes with the garage, but there's also a little car wash (that I wish they had integrated into the road system somehow rather than it being a stand-alone) and a parking attendant. It's also great to know that  it's made with vegetable dye and not made with hazardous materials or plastic.

0066620996|3.0|The basic concept of \\"Good to Great\\" is that there appear to be companies that outperform others quite spectacularly for a  number of years.  Jim Collins sets out the results of his research team that looked at \\"why?\\"<br /><br />I'm not a statistician, but whenever I read a book such as this I get worried about the selection criteria.  Who says these companies are great?  The key measure used by Collins is \\"Ratio of Cumulative Stock Returns to General Market\\".  Such a measure only looks at the company through the eyes of one stakeholder - the owners.  There are also stakeholders called customers, suppliers, staff, the industry and the community - these do not seem to be considered.  Taking just one stakeholder measurement does not in my mind, deem the company \\"great\\".<br /><br />The author lists eight reasons for the selected companies success.  Ranging from what he calls \\"level 5 leadership\\" through to continual persistence - akin to pushing against a giant flywheel.  These may or may not be accurate reflections of the reasons for success.  But how does one emulate them?<br /><br />This is a dense book on leadership - perhaps a little too dense for me.  Nothing wrong with the concepts, but I found it a little hard to concentrate.  I would have liked to see shorter chapters that engaged my thinking, rather than long winded explanations.  I'd also like to hear how these \\"great\\" companies manage their other stakeholders.<br /><br />If you liked \\"In Search Of Excellence\\", you'll like this book.<br /><br />Bob Selden, author [[ASIN:1432714287 What To Do When You Become The Boss: How new managers become successful managers]]

0385338724|3.0|It was with great hopes that I picked up this book at the library the other day. I was looking forward to reading this especially since I loved \\"The Undomestic Goddess.\\" I had read the first few books of the Shopoholic Series, which was ok, but got tedious after awhile. I mean, how can you keep writing about shopping so many time? Anyhow, I picked up this book and it sounded so promising. What is there not to like about waking up in the hospital and finding yourself a more gorgeous, thinner self than you were three years previous, which was the last thing you remembered? And being married to a gorgeous bloke with a lot of money. Wow!    After Lexi leaves the hospital to the gorgeous flat she shares with her husband, Eric, she struggles to remember who she was before the accident. There is a teaser that there was something big about her past, which was provided by Jon, Eric's architect. That teaser was a bust because there were all this built-up to it but led to nothing more than just an affair.     The book is ok. It is entertaining. It is quick. But it is definitely not like her other stand-alone novels. If you want a fun read, I would definitely recommend \\"The Undomestic Goddess.\\" That one is still my favorite of her books. Just save your hard-earned pennies and borrow this one from the library. You'll be glad that you did.     3/10/08
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Recently, i've been on a tear, watching all the new versions of Jane Austen's novels, and then as well some other period pieces similar to hers, such as Jane Eyre, and North and South.     I wasn't in particular looking forward to watching this, I didn't expect much and didn't think i'd be able to sit through the whole thing (it being 4 hours and all). But as soon as I started watching, I got swept up into Jane's world, I was intrigued by Thornfield, and wanted to know everything about Mr. Rochester.     Ruth Wilson as Jane is a revelation, she makes you feel so much warmth towards her, and you honestly want to follow where she goes. Toby Stephens is amazing, and will forever be etched into my mind as being Edward Rochester, there will be no other that can fill his place. His character is right up there with Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy, and Richard Armitage's Mr. Thornton, he's just that good.     The story is interesting, it keeps you wanting to watch more, and after each episode, you can't wait to watch the next. I watched this straight, where most of these would take a couple of days to finish, I couldn't leave it be.     This is the definitive Jane Eyre, and recommend it to all those who enjoyed the book, or for those looking for a Darcy replacement!
B000E6UWE4|4.0|When I bought this book (I am now on Midnight Tides) I did NOT like it, because I felt the writer was giving us half of what was happening.  I was very frustrated with the dialogue that, at times, seemed only half there.  Meaning I felt like I was listening in on a conversation and was not privy to two thirds of the information that the characters knew.  But then I decided to just let go, and tried not to figure out what was going to happen, or what character X had just meant, and just let the story take me.  It was worth it. And I will say that I feel Mr Erikson has a style of writing unlike any other fantasy writer I have read.    Pick this book up and just let it take you.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of Pride and Prejudice, and of course the Colin Firth version (hello wet shirt!), and I had never really thought I could enjoy another period piece like that one. Then I discovered North and South, and all of that changed.     When watching for this for the first time, I was so engrossed in the film that I didn't stop watching until it was finished. Having never read the book, I didn't know what to expect and there were many delightful surprises along the way. I now plan to read the novel and hope to fall in love with it as much as I have this movie.     The character of John Thornton is so incredibly beautiful and poignant, and was handled just right by the wonderful Richard Armitage. Not only does he bring the necessary hardness to the role, but he brings a rare vulnerability to the role, that makes him such a diverse individual. He grabs you in with those eyes of his, and makes you want to know all there is about him. In many ways he is similar to Mr. Darcy, but I found him to be almost, more real if that makes and sense. The depth and diversity that he puts into the character makes him so unique to these types of films and you'll find it hard to resist his charms. I daresay he is probably the sexiest man (and character) in these period novels that I have ever read or seen a movie of.     The heroine, Margaret is also one of great character, and Daniela Denby Ashe pulls it off with great poise and sensibility. While I was angry when she rejected Mr. Thornton (how could she???), the beauty of the scene is that the two play off eachother so well, and make you believe what's going on is real. His I do not with to possess you, because I love you line is one of the most heart wrenching things, and her refusal of him is so heartbreakingly good, that it will leave you eagerly anticipating the next episode.     Overall one of the greatest period pieces ever, and probably one of the most beautiful films as well. The simplicity in the main theme is so breathtakingly beautiful, that you will be humming it days after seeing it. And the image at the end of the first episode, of Thornton walking through the mill with all the cotton in the air will also be etched in your mind as well. The music and that image blend so beautifully together, and really create one of the most mesmerizing and memorable scenes in television history.

1592289444|5.0|In 1941 as the rest of Europe was entering WWII, we learn that in the Siberian Gulag there are political prisoners sentenced for 10-25 years for offences such as being nationality other than Russian.  These are mostly young men, strong, educated and smart.  Qualities that present a threat to Stalin's new world where only Russians are to be trusted and all others are representation of threat to a New World he was building in that part of the world.  Story about seven men of different nationalities who amongst themselves speak Polish, Russian, French, English and German languages.  They all want their freedom more than anything else. Even death seems a better option than spending the rest of their lives in humiliating conditions of a political prisoner in the arctic pole.  This group of men decides to make an escape during snow night of early April 1941, hoping that snow will cover their tracks and give them a lead for their escape plan.  They head south and start their facinating journey thru Mongolia, China, Gobe desert, Tibet and India.  Their determination to escape and survive is mesmerizing.  I could not put this book down.  The book written in 1956 still has magnificent impression on anyone who reads it.  It is a story of human triumph in the face of diversity that is indescribeable.  Small kindness of village people they meet along the way is heartbreaking.  These people instictively know that the group is the \\"unfortunates\\" - title reserved for Siberian prisoners.  But they are not judgemental and they help in the only way they can by providing food, shelter and clothes to them to help them on their journey to the south.  This book will help anyone to be reminded of the small things we have to be thankful for in our everyday lives.  It is a book of human bonding, friendship, endurance, bravery and determination.  This book is a must read no matter what generation, gender or social standing a person is. It will make you humble and grateful for the little things in life.  The book will change you and the perception of limits of the human will.s in life.  The book will change you and the perception of limits of the human will.

0321544080|5.0|What I find most compelling in McNally's work is its lack of pretense, and genuine feel for creating compelling images without any attempt - conscious or otherwise - to become more important than the subjects he so creatively portrays.  No artifice here, no attempt at becoming larger than the celebrities he occasionally shoots, just a great flow of ideas and inspiring images. McNally proves that you don't have to have Tom Cruise in front of your lens to create memorable images.      As for the book itself: terrific.  Fun pictures, well explained, from both technical and aesthetic points of view.  For the techno-inclined who much care about what's in his bag - it's there, and so is plenty of \\"inside the head\\" of the photographer narrative.      If you're a photographer, from aspiring or working pro, you'll likely love this book. Not only for the photographs, which are uniformly splendid, but also for the valuable insight McNally so willingly shares.  Get this book for yourself, or as a gift, or both, but don't miss it.
B000YXMMAE|3.0|or is Thom Yorke turning into one giant wailing vowel?  Seriously! The album should have been called AEIOU and sometimes something coherant. I thought we were passed this. Oh well, at least this album has a lot to offer in terms of variety.  It definitely isn't an eraser knockoff and it certainly has its high points. I just don't feel they are really moving forward, but maybe that's what they want. At least they didn't take a step backwards and have Timbaland produce the bloody thing.
B000ANXLB2|3.0|It is at best Ok, average performance. The delivery of Beethoven music, probably because of BAD camera work is tedious and heavy. Since it is DVD I was expecting for more. I lost track of the music on third minute. If you are looking for great visual experience and Beethoven music see [[ASIN:B001ETLY1A Beethoven Symphonies 1,2,3,4,5,6 and Art Galleries of the Time, 2DVDs+3CDs Ultimate MosaicDVD Collection]]   I can listen to the performance, but the visual element is very distracting. To my taste there's some lyricism in Beethoven symphonies. In this Karajan's version it sounds very harsh, straightforward.

1401200923|2.0|Unfortunately, this second volume of \\"Batman: Hush\\" falls victim to the same problems that usually plague the second halves of graphic novel series.  In other words, the storyline is predictable and the action outweighed by tedious amounts of exposition, as though the author is trying to unravel the previous volume's mysteries as fast as possible rather than allowing the story to unfold more naturally.  The artwork is still very solid, but I would have greatly preferred to sacrifice some of the mystery of Volume I (which is excellent!) if it would have meant keeping Batman from long expository ponderings while he's supposedly fighting for his life!<br /><br />Reading this second volume, I was reminded again and again of the second volume of \\"Superman: For Tomorrow\\", which suffers almost all the same problems.  Overall, I'd say both series are still worth reading, but in both cases, the first half is definitely better!
B000UU4NE4|5.0|I love spider-man movies and this movie was more exciting. This movie enemy was sandman, black suit, and his angry friend that three combination. Also the spider-man never lose control his mind but this movie was he changed a bit. Anyway this movie was exciting and fun. I love it.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Fans of Ridley Scott movies know that they almost always come in twos--the theatrical version, then the director's cut, released sometime later and without much fanfare.  Invariably, the director's cuts are almost always leaps and bounds better than the theatrical versions, which tend to take very long, complex stories and boil them down to something more palitable to the bean-counters.  \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" is no exception.      While the theatrical version of this film left me grimacing and shaking my head, this director's cut manages to fill in virtually all of the holes that plagued the theatrical version's plot, and allows the storyline to unfold at a much more entertaining, natural pace.  Orlando Bloom--often said to have been miscast in the lead role--fares far better in this version, and actually makes the character come alive!  I've shown this director's cut to people who downright despised the theatrical version, and without exception, everyone has completely changed their minds about this movie!  Like \\"Blade Runner\\", \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" demonstrates just how greatly two versions of the same film can differ.  I highly recommend this director's cut, which in my opinion is quite possibly the best Ridley Scott has ever made!!
B000WDROYK|4.0|This movie was good and I was very impressed. But this movie was never speaks English I hate subtitled. The story was sad and heart stopping.  Anyway this movie made good. However why the loving people couldn't live long together? in this movie, that's sad.
B00092ZL80|5.0|The team of these two great groups, was the ultimate choice. The brass section of Chiacgo is fantastic and when you put Earth, Wind & Fire's brass with them, the performance was unbelieveable. I thought that Chiacgo when playing solo without Earth, Wind & Fire was much better than the solo act of Earth, Wind & Fire. That's most likely because I'm a Chiacgo fan. All in all the dvd is very much worth purchasing and you won't be disappointed.
0452287588|2.0|I'm almost done reading Eckhart Tolle's, \\"A New Earth....\\" and I'm still waiting for the enlightenment or \\"A-Ha\\" moment. It's pretty basic theology 101, along with some \\"pop culture\\" pep talk all while breaking down what the ego is and means. I have read past pop self-help books about people needing to \\"Lose the Ego already.\\"     At times, the language is a bit hard to transfer to everyday language, as it speaks a bit \\"above the reader.\\" However, it's a good reminder what Jesus' beliefs were and how we can all be much kinder to each other.     I just never got that \\"awakening\\" that Oprah and many are buzzing about. If it's good for others, that's great though. I just didn't get much out of it personally.
630463949X|5.0|Of course I'm Speaking about Mick Fleetwood. He definitely is a man of many facial expressions while taking his percussion to the ultimate playing experience. Not only is Mick fantastic on the drums, Lindsey Buckingham is one of the best guitar players of today. Watching the way his playing almost becomes magical is astounding. And of course you cannot and would not forget that distintive voice of Stevie Nicks, along with Christine McVie, make the great sounds of this vintage group awesome. If you like the music of Fleetwood Mac, you will love this dvd !!!
B000VDDES6|4.0|You know you're heading for a good movie when you get the first giggle at the very start. Right at the very start. Before the movie starts.<br /><br />I normally would go out of my way to avoid a movie that not only features Jack Black, Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Steve Carell etc. The latest Hollywood Rat Pack. Sometimes they can be good in movies (Shallow Hal), but mostly, they think they're funny.<br /><br />This has to be the first movie where they ARE funny. I was initially expecting a movie that was totally sexist. While it is totally sexist, it's cringeworthy (the outfits, the BAD hair, the facial hair), and funny (Baxter talking to Ron among others), and it's superior to all the other movies that feature the main stars. I can't really comment on Will Ferrell, I've only previously seen him in Old School (I think), and don't remember being that fussed about that film. It was something to pass the time.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Christina Applegate character is a role any actress could have played. How many actresses could have got away with it though? She manages to pull off a previously stupid sounding role, and make it her own, and make it work against Will Ferrell.<br /><br />Anchorman is a story about the seventies. And I'm not just talking about bad hair, bad clothes, bad facial hair, bad music. It's a man's world. Women belong in the kitchen, tending to their husband's every need, making babies, while he goes out and earns the money, and eyes up the pretty girls, and regrets getting married. More specifically, it's about a woman, trying to break her way into being the first female anchorwoman on TV news. It was a very man's world apparently. But the lead male anchorman has some fatal flaws, apart from his looks - he falls for a pretty girl in a skirt, he reads ANYTHING on the teleprompter (heaven forbid, don't put a question mark at the end of a sentence that doesn't require one). The rest of his supporting anchorman include sportscaster Champ Kind (David Koechner), feature story guy Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), and weatherman Brick Tamland (Steven Carell). They yet again manage to hold their own against Will's character, Ron, and pull off memorable performances, especially Steve LOUD NOISES Carell.<br /><br />Full of funny situations, hilarious lines, funny outfits, and deliberate OTT acting, Anchorman is a film I would have normally avoided, and I totally expected to do an entirely different review.

0375701427|4.0|Through 'American Pastoral' Philip Roth explores grand themes of the second half of the \\"American Century.\\" Seymour \\"Swede\\" Levov, son of a fully assimilated Jewish family, has it all growing up in post-WW II America: he's attractive, popular, athletically gifted, married to a former Miss America contender and believes in the American promise of reward-for-work. He has it so good, in fact, that he's never had to face any significant setbacks in life. None, that is, until the advent of the 1960s. Swede's Norman Rockwell existence is shattered when his daughter slowly and inexplicably turns politically radical. Despite all of his efforts to understand his daughter, counsel her, empathize with her, and nurture her, she cannot be reached. Eventually, she completes her journey towards radicalism and bombs a local town establishment as an act of protest against the war in Vietnam that she despises.<br /><br />This plot allows Roth to examine the giant generational rift that opened up in American society in the 60s -- a rift that has never quite closed. Swede's universe was steeped in tradition, hard work, being a respectable citizen and playing by the rules. He held close all of the virtues his father had instilled in him. In American Pastoral, the reader is led into the mind of a parent of the 60s, raised themselves by parents of the 40s. Through his eyes, we see the incomprehensibility of privileged children who wanted for nothing  but went wild anyway. His daughter's rejections of all of his principles is simply bewildering to him...and remains so for the duration of the book. A linked theme he explores is the decay of urban America, the end of \\"the neighborhood\\" as a cohesive social entity and the export of manufacturing jobs during the early days of globalization.<br /><br />As a sociological exploration, I found the material compelling if somewhat bleak. This novel is a tragedy in the extreme in which nihilism and the randomness of the universe reign triumphant in the life of a good and decent man who, despite his best effort, is led to ruin.  This theme reminds me a little bit of Thomas Hardy's \\"Jude the Obscure\\" which dishes out the same lesson: having your heart in the right place is no guarantee of comfort in life.<br /><br />Some cons: the sub-plot about a the complication of a Jew marrying a Catholic beauty queen in the 1950s seemed a little late and tacked-on. It was too brief and too late in the book to feel like a substantially contributing part of the plot. (I get the fact that it further illustrated Swede's disillusionment with what he thought was a perfect situation, but still...) Also, the pages and pages dedicated to the manufacture of gloves in the Levov factory became tedious after a while. The point Roth was trying to make was that Swede's father really, really believed in the work that he had committed his life to. But I got it in the first 10 pages of glove descriptions.

0452289963|4.0|Great thought-provoking book. Lots to read, lots to internalize. Found it helpful in gaining insight into what makes me tick. Found lots of applications in the real world. Requires slow reading and much processing of the information on the page. It is worth it though - at least in my opinion.
1582701709|3.0|The highly touted book ,the Secret, provides some useful insight into the most ancient view of life and the concepts of paradise in the human experience. The author uses plain English and makes points with examples. For those with an IQ higher than room temperature, the incessant repetition is frustrating.     Nevertheless, if you're fed up with the vestiges of organized religion of the middle ages still being perpetrated on humans of the 21st century, this book is refreshing and worthwhile.

They have beautiful melodies, powerful vocals and guitars (and drums!)!   This is an excellent compilation for an excellent rock and roll band such as Aersomith, period 1986-1993 included in this disc. Rock On!
B000IONJH4|2.0|I remember watching Dune when I was a kid, and I recently read the book.

B0013D8LOU|5.0|I was completely blown away by this movie.  I am not a slasher movie fan by any means, but I do enjoy Tim Burton movies, and Alan Rickman always delights me, so I went to see this movie.  It is both epic and beautiful - at least in a monochromatic sense.  You have a nearly black and white contrast of charaters to the redness of the blood.  I should mention, this movie is not nearly as bloody as I thought it might be, in fact, it was rather minimal in my opinion.  In truth, i found there to be an extremely witty layer of dark humor running throughout the film.  I was highly amused in many places.  The humor reminded me of the works of Edward Gorey: dark, dismal, and extremely funny.  In fact, many of characters in the movie looked like Edward Gorey characters in their period dress and stark makeup contrasts.  I was more than delighted with this film, and I strongly encourage potential viewers not to be dissuaded by the gore factor.  Its really not that bad, and its done in such a way that it is intended to look theatrical.  This is without doubt the best musical remake that I have seen.  The entire cast did a brilliant job, and the entire film was amusing, shocking, and above all, entertaining!!!!
B00007GZR0|4.0|After directing Doris Day in 1963's still-hilarious [[ASIN:B00007GZR1 The Thrill of It All!]], Norman Jewison showed similar comic sensibilities with this screwball 1964 marital farce complemented by a sharp screenplay by longtime veteran Julius Epstein. This one represents something of a departure in that Day and Rock Hudson, in their third and last pairing, play a married couple from the outset. As George and Judy Kimball, they are a happily married suburban couple hamstrung by his persistent hypochondria. Convinced that he is dying after a regular check-up, George spends the rest of the story preparing for what he thinks will be his imminent death, including setting up Judy with her next husband, a former suitor whom they literally run into at their country club.<br /><br />Unlike the previous two films, Hudson actually dominates this movie, and he is in peak comic form with a dryly funny turn as George. With her glamour minimized in favor of her homespun likeability, Day is relegated to the role of the confused wife here, though she has funny moments along the way. Randall steals practically all his scenes as devoted neighbor Arnold constantly in a drunken stupor in his premature bereavement over George's departure, and Paul Lynde has a riotous scene as an overzealous memorial park director. This one may lack the will-she-won't-she dilemma of the first two films, 1959's [[ASIN:B0001CNRC0 Pillow Talk]] and 1961's [[ASIN:B0001CNRB6 Lover Come Back]] and is usually dismissed as a domestic comedy, but I think the set-up is genuinely clever and the laughs well-earned. The only extra on the 2003 DVD is the original theatrical trailer. For those interested in all three films, your best bet is to purchase the bargain-priced [[ASIN:B000P2A22O Doris Day and Rock Hudson Comedy Collection]].

So, I purchased them based on those reviews, and, sure enough, they are GREAT!!!<br /><br />The sound is awesome, clear, with super separation . . . you can tell because as you up the volume, nothing changes; you don't experience it as too loud.<br /><br />They are really comfortable.  You put them on and don't even feel them.<br /><br />The only thing they are is big.  Luckily, I have a big head, but if you're a woman with a small head, there is no way to make these smaller.  I wear them without expanding them and they just fit.  I think they're made for men, mostly.<br /><br />I am really grateful that all the other folks who purchased these headphones took the time to review them and that Amazon has this great feature.  It was those reviews that made me purchase these headphones.  Thank you all and thank you Amazon!!!!

Every mom should buy this album for her teenage daughter.  I'm telling everyone about this album.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|Ark of Truth is a must see for fans of the series. It concludes the Ori battle and yet ends with SG-1 starting another mission. Something SG-1 has not had time to do for a couple years. Let's face it most of us have missed Jack and the exploring they use to do. The bulk of the movie is finding a weapon to destroy the Ori, but it turns out it is not where they first thought and when they find it, it doesn't do what they originally thought either. However they are victorious and there are changes of loyalty from a place you might not expect. Overall I was not at all disappointed, but I must admit the scene with Teal'c walking across a desert after being shot by a Ori weapon was a bit much.<br /><br />The wife and I were a bit disappointed that Richard Dean Anderson didn't even put in a cameo appearance. Excellent production values as always, they won't seem better as the TV series was so good that we were all spoiled by them. The DVD includes plenty of extras including a prelude you can play previous to watching the movie. The prelude is snapshot segments from several episodes from the last two seasons and that lead up to the final battle. I bought a copy because I loved the series and it wouldn't be complete without this movie. They made it clear another movie is in the works. Let us hope there will be more exploration and singular episodic adventures for future movies. Great quality picture and sound and good replayability.

I should not have worried.  Although the language is definitely adult--no Harry Potter here--the game's afoot and the story unique.  I am looking forward to adding many Lynch novels to my fiction collection.    Definitely worth reading.
B000WQWPKA|2.0|This is a great movie but how can the DVD special ed have more content then a 30GB Blu ray disc. This blu ray is lacking the behind the action content, it is lacking the directors cuts. Save your money and get the DVD 2 disc instead of this quick buck pacakge by Fox.

0385338082|5.0|I had never heard of Kinsella until I saw this book in an airport store. I bought it because when I read the back of it I laughed til I cried. Just the back!! The whole book is hilarious and witty and light and fun. The heroine seems just like me (and every other woman I imagine). Like Bridget Jones but not as depressing. I started reading other books by Kinsella (The Undomestic Goddess and Shopaholic books) but this one is my favorite. You won't be disappointed!
B00005JMJG|5.0|Elizabeth Essenfeld says: This movie is fantastic! Jim Carey really steps out of his 'Dumb and Dumber' cast type and plays a somber realistic character that is believable and likeable.  The movie has twists and turns with outstanding effects. A 'must own' for the DVD collection.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|Another brilliant season of Veronica Mars! Sadly the last one as I have been made aware of recently :(    Veronica and her friends are now in College at Hearst, however you don't see much of Wallis, but she has made new friends now and occasionally catches up with Wallis.    The only thing that was not so great was (without giving anything away!) the open ending, I felt that the ending really didn't resolve much and it feels like another couple episodes should have been added to the season.    Previews are included on this disc for what they thought would be the 4th season, which looks interesting but seems to have lost the 'spark' the original three seasons had, so maybe it's not such a bad thing there are only the three seasons after all.    The outtakes are fairly funny, and it's good to see the cast and crew having fun :)
0143038419|5.0|Elizabeth Essenfeld says: This is such an inspirational book.  Gilbert's accounts of her journey towards self-actualization are brave and ring with an honest we can all relate to.  This book is perfect as a gift for a friend going through hard times or as a indulgence to yourself looking for some guidance.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I just finished watching it, and I loved it. Great wrap up of the Ori storyline, though I would love to see how the humans and former Priors adapt to life after the Ori. It was everything I hoped for, and more. I really, really hope there will be more SG1 moves after the second one comes out.     I had to go to 2 stores to find it today, the day it came out. And the copy I got was the last in the store. Hopefully, its doing as well elsewhere.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Elizabeth Essenfeld says: This is a very cool movie with an amazing soundtrack. A great gift for a Beatles fan.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|ABSOLUTELY AN ENJOYABLE IRISH PRESENTATION.  WILL PURCHASE CDs FROM THESE FIVE LADIES AGAIN AND AGAIN!  GREAT PRICE, TOO!
B00005V9HH|5.0|Elizabeth Essenfeld says:    This movie is hilarious! A great cast with all the turns and twists you could ask for. Kevin Spacey is outstanding! If you are a fan of 'Resevoir Dogs' and 'Momento', you will love 'The Usual Suspects'.
B0009F9O6M|5.0|Luis Mejia (son) - The second concrete album of the band is their real point of turn, in both their senses of musical direction and style (which gets more dramatic but specially harmonious) and their classic almost all time lineup emerges, Nic Potter (electric guitar and bass) goes out, leaving a very original trace ever happened in rock music: the least need of an electric guitar, though still Potter and Robert Fripp collaborate in this aspect of this album. H to He Who Am The Only One is a near masterpiece, every sound on the album is completely inflictive, eclectic, and full of originality and a body of work, the feelings this album (or generally the band, as this special quality never changed in their years) gives you are exactly chills, for any rocker or listener this is such an original side of music that appeared to be totally unnoticed, that's why you can hear to their music anywhere, this style doesn't sound dated at all (in fact, many punk revival hits are going back in a certain secretive way to this matching style), and the dramatic and exagerate but really rocking feelings it gives you, but still being such a compelling and cerebral work any music essentialist will recognize (just see this band's professional critics!).<br /><br />\\"Killer\\" became another of their classics, it arises your attention in its instrumental, kind of jazzy start, express madness in the way Hammill sings it, and even get you to laugh a bit, and as it is quite repetitive and catchy it is a true gem, the same as \\"House With No Door\\", another memorable piece, this is more serious in its theme of loneliness but the dramatic piano touches are outbursting. \\"The Emperor In His War Room\\" hits this same feelings, but with a touch of serenity.<br /><br />\\"Lost\\" starts the second part of the album as more of a strange but complex piece, full of alternative and non-standard melodies, key risings, but specially the way of mixing and juxtaposing the instrumentation, and quite a really jamming but fierceful piece. The ending \\"Pioneers Over C\\" is a critics favourite (one of mines, too), specially because it is one of their most representative pieces, the beauty and cohersion of the obvious experimentation, the \\"free verse\\" lyrics, switching vocal range that can be provided only and just by Hammill, and it focuses more on rhythm, a very jazzy one, instead of mellody.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the extra \\"Squid 1/Squid 2/Octopus\\" is pure experimentation and jamming. Overall, this is truly their first true expression of quality and originality, finally melodious, and for the ones looking for a rock album different from the commercialized trash rock of today's charts, but sounding different and acquireable, their progressive music full of horns and organs will just be perfect, also including Hammill's vocal duties which there are no words which exist to qualify it.piece.

B000GFLKF8|2.0|Spike Lee is not intelligent enough as a director to tackle the many disjointed plot lines of this film.  In one scene you'll have a cliche filled mess regarding how Muslims are treated by the police.  Then in the next, he's trying to create an intellectual battle between Washington and Owen.  Believe it or not, despite the fact that there is so much going on, the entire film just feels so, well, boring.  Jody Foster is a pointless addition, and after about 35 minutes you're still waiting for something to improve...but....it never does.  I'll give it 2 stars simply because I love bank robbery movies, but this one might just be the worst on record. Even Denzel seems to be stumbling through this role, I haven't figured out why he ever agreed to take it on. Stick to mindless UFC and car chases Spikey, because serious directing eludes you.
B000O77V4W|3.0|Just a short review to say that, although I am sure I will like this video; if you have an el-cheapo (like me) DVD player.....wait for the  April 1 release also shown on search page.   I ordered this import and although the specifications shows it NTSC....it is actually PAL formatted (European) In fact, it has PAL printed on DVD.  My regular DVD player will not play it (it ejects on insert).  My GoVideo DVD-R will play it but video has horizonal lines running thru it and is unwatchable.  So if you order this import, BE SURE your DVD player will play PAL format!!
B000006045|5.0|Excellent. If you like to hear to different music genres, you have to try Massive Attack. I tried to listen to Massive Attack more than 10 years ago, when I was around my 20's. To be honest, I wasn't ready. Now I am enjoying every single song from this band, all rhythm and sounds. And I can understand how these guys made a huge evolution to the music.    Are you ready for Massive Attack?
B00111YM5G|4.0|I really thought this film would be a cheap Prophecy knock off....which even that was enough i checked it out on netflicks. I was really impressed....unknown cast that did a great job...the writting wasn't the strongsuit but wasn't horrible and the movie was highly entertaining....even though the effects weren't big budget they were ok and the terrific cinematography helped them look better then they were. I ended up buying my own copy after renting it.
B00133KFGW|4.0|Freddie Highmore as a guitar-playing Oliver, Robin Williams as Fagin, and even an Artful Dodger by the name of Arthur. The movie is indeed excellent, yet predictable (and completely satisfying).
B0011NVC9I|3.0|It was entertaining though quite visually stunning....the writing had \\"A twist\\" although nothing that hadn't been done before. Ususally Gaimon is very original and i figured especially with such a wide open ambiguious text to work with. It definately wasn't awful though you get what you pay for :)
B00005JPFH|5.0|I just wrote a scathing review of Seinfeld season 9 before I came to this review.  And how much happier I am for it.  The basis for my critical review of Seinfeld was the elitism present in the cast away from the camera.  How much nicer is it to see Tobey McGuire and this talented cast.  I'm quite certain that Tobey McGuire is a nice guy (very much like Peter Parker) and that's a good thing.  As for the movie itself:  it really grows on you.  The first time I viewed it was at a movie theater and, like many, I thought they tried to do too much.  But the second time I saw it, it got better.  The third time I viewed it, better still.  I don't think they tried to do too much at all now.  As someone that never read the comic books I didn't really know much about some of the villains in this movie (Sandman...the whole Black Spidey thing, etc).  I remember seeing, in passing at local 7-Elevens, the black spider-man on the front cover of the comic books.  But I never took the time to learn about it.  So it was kinda nice (as a casual fan of what spider-man is all about) to learn a bit about its history.  Again, Tobey McGuire was the absolute perfect choice for Peter Parker, well done guys.
B000ZLFALS|4.0|The point of buying Blu-ray is to have a crystal-clear picture which is exactly what the cinematography of this film deserves. The movie itself is excellent. The story is filled with powerful, moving, radical scenes and images. However, the story itself is not great. There are some confusing points and much of it is random and does not move the story along. However, the soundtrack is excellent. I am saying this as a Beatles fan. The singers and muscicians certainly did justice to the greatest Beatles songs. My favorites are \\"I want to Hold Your Hand\\" and \\"Let it Be.\\" If you simply want to be entertained and are a Beatles fan, then this is the perfect movie for you. The HD is the icing on the cake for sure.
B000VECAEO|2.0|I'm a Seinfeld fan so let me explain the reasoning for giving the 9th season 2 stars.  The entire series started and ended weak.  First, I'm not a big fan of the final episode.  I remember it was a bit of a let-down when I first viewed it.  Subsequent viewings haven't really changed my opinion.  Second, after I had about the first 5 seasons or so I saw Jason Alexander on a poker show on tv.  He was such an arrogant jerk it's not even funny. (he was genuinely bragging about \\"being a millionaire\\" and how some young lady who was dealing cards was obligated to treat him differently as a result) We all know about Michael Richard's patently racist crap. Seinfeld and Louis-Dreyfus are both elitist snobs, of course.  So the second star was taken off for personal petty reasons:  it bugs me a little bit to provide money to talented, but elitist jerks.  (It seems a lot of their snob humor was genuine whereas I always thought it was sarcastic in nature).  The reason for the third star being removed was based on their marketing.  The release of a collector's compilation pack kinda bugged me.  I could have saved money by waiting.  They know there are some small-minded people out there who will purchase it all over again just to have it (as one reviewer proudly proclaimed he did).  I'm not so petty, I'll live without the stupid little book and what not.  Besides, money seems to be the root of their elitism.  If I can mitigate their real-life snobbery by a modicum, I must try.
B000000ORX|5.0|Take a singular artist who became known for her gossamer voice, throw in a few decades and a couple thousand cartons of cigarettes and what do you end up with? Simply one of the most gorgeous CDs in her collection. It is wonderful to hear Joni's voice now, it is so different than back in the '70s... but it is definitely the same compelling, masterful instrument. As she has become older and her voice has deepened and grown a bit raspy, it has become downright haunting in places on this CD, like in \\"Slouching Towards Bethlehem\\" and my favorite \\"Two Grey Rooms\\". Supporting this unique voice which, though wisely not chasing the shattering highs of years gone by, is still precise and versatile, is Joni's surreal guitar and piano work. Supported by a smaller but familiar cast of expert musicians, \\"NRH\\" is one of the most beautiful, most mature, most objective CDs I've heard in a long time. It is so hard to believe it came out over 15 years ago!
1594489505|4.0|In this story, the lives of two women are thrown together then torn apart by the gut-wrenching twists and turns of Afghanistan's history. Through the  tragic tales of Miriam and Laila, we learn about Soviet occupation, the Taliban, war lords, ethnic and class tensions, extreme poverty and oppression, and the grim heroes whose small gestures help the women and their families survive.<br /><br />A spoonful of drama helps the history go down, and I hope that people reading this walk away with a better understanding of a country the US is now deeply involved in and with a heightened sensitivity to the delicate balancing act of making peace in a country that has been at war for decades and the unfathomable suffering of individuals that have been the consequence.<br /><br />Some stories are worth telling, even in the high drama and simple writing that characterizes Hosseini's prose. I wish that I could be swept away by the language of his books and not have to listen to my inner critic hmphing at his heavy-handedness, but I will settle for sweeping through his stories quickly and getting my dose of drama and history.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This is more than a feel good movie. It is a beautiful story about a boy searching for his parents. He goes about his quest listening to the music all around him. Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers are great. Russell's performance is truly excellent. She is cellist who becomes pregnant after one night with a bad singer. Throughout the movie, she searches for her son. Freddie Highmore is a fantastic actor. His face never lost that innocence and hopefulness that made the movie fantastic. The story was absolutely beautiful and hopeful. Yes, the movie is sentimental and full of events that are way too coincidental or do not make sense. But, so what? The movie is absolutely beautiful, and the plot and visual representations are enhanced through the music.<br /><br />The Special Features has deleted scenes.
0307237699|1.0|Okay, I wanted to read this book because of the recent campaigns...I thought it would help me clue in to the man himself.  And it does, he is a genuine man with a lot of heartfelt motives.  But to be honest, he's better at speeches.  I closed this book before I finished the first chapter and stacked it away on a shelf.  It would be great for a person who is completely aware of political agendas, history, current events.  For me, no thrill here, none at all.  A lot of name dropping, names I didn't have a clue about, and a lot of political ramble that truly went in one ear and out the other.  So if politics is your thing then this is your book but, I prefer an interesting read.  Can't waste my time in that one.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|Fine example of great television plot structure.  You can follow the large story arch's of each individual character or drop in for a single episode and still be engrossed in the story.  This show is made for television and not dvd like so many other tv shows today.  Thoroughly enjoyable, relies on good acting and good writing, not on gimmicks.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|This is one of the most original recordings I've heard in a long time.  Having written all the songs herself, Melody Gardot presents them in a heartfelt and seemingly unrehearsed manner that I can't stop listening to over and over.  Much promise for her development when starting off so well.
B000001E7T|5.0|Truly she is an amazing sensual Goddess!  PJ Harvey has unbelievable vocal talent.  I have bought almost all of her work and I am craving more.  Her music is a Haunting, Sweet, and brutally honest journey into the minds of us all, so humanly perverse yet innocent.  Surround yourself with her music and and feel it.
B000SXOGW2|4.0|First, I'd like to commend the astute analyses of the other reviewers. The Roger Waters vs. Pink Floyd comments really capture a debate that should make good sense to Floyd fans. I would just like to add one point which illustrates that debate: I think this album would have been far better had it ended with \\"The Final Cut\\". To me, Not Now John and Two Suns feel like after-thoughts or, perhaps, some effort to include at least one song that had a chance of getting some air-play at the time the album was released. I never listen to those tracks because for me, it's like eating a delicately prepared gourmet meal and then, instead of savoring the taste for a while, shovelling a handful of Doritos in my mouth. I like Doritos. But there is a time and a place for them. And this album is neither the time nor the place. The Final Cut is a more complete and satisfying work of art without those two tracks.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|This cd is great listening, period. It has all the great songs from the Beatles, and if you saw the movie this is a must have collection. Actually, it's a must have for any Beatles fan!
B000V6BE6C|1.0|Hey if you think listening to korn, nickleback, and three days grace is cool then I would recommend you pick up this horrendous, awful, and embarrassing record.  If your a bone-head who thinks the war in Iraq was a great idea and your favorite beer is bud heavy (even though you know it is awful), and if you just started another cycle of HGH rush to the stores immediately to pick this hot one up! I know I have just formed a gross stereotype of people who might potentially enjoy this record but I could not have done it without Avenged Sevenfold's willingness to belong to this stereotype.  I mean is this the first record besides Toby Keith's to defend the war on Iraq? Fred Durst would even think these guys are retarded meat heads. He would \\"break stuff\\" knowing that there are idiots bigger than him in the world.  This band was actually once innovative believe it or not. I remember hearing \\"second heartbeat\\" on a subcity compilation (one of the hopelessly devoted to yous) and thinking wow this band has done something really interesting.  They literally brought so-cal melodic hardcore sounds and mixed them seamlessly with classic 80's style thrash, and all the while, molding them into giant rock opuses.  Music fans everywhere shed a tear b/c those days are long gone and I am sad to say I liked this band at all. I even chose to watch their set at warped tour instead of watching taking back sunday and bad religion playing back to back (in retrospect a god awful decision). I mean seriously if one was to make a film about the downfall of America culturally and intellectually I would start with an introduction by Bill O'Reilly, and the soundtrack of the film that followed would be provided by these inbred mutants (we could also insert some trivium and stone sour if you want as well). Seriously if I was millionaire, I would pay each and every one of you to not buy this record because IT IS AWFUL. Also, if you were wondering how long it took me write this review don't worry ITWAS ALMOST EASY. I just cut and pasted half of it from a review I wrote  about disturberd's new record, MAN!
B0010X8NF0|4.0|Awesome movie, but a crappy dvd. Don't get me wrong, it is definitely worth buying because Wes Anderson is a genius and has outdone himself again, however, I was disappointed because unlike The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic, and Rushmore, this dvd doesn't come with any of Eric Anderson's drawings or commentary. Again, it's a great movie but it should really be released from the Criterion Collection.
B000NA28A2|4.0|Juan Luis is a very, very talented person!  Giving his life to Christ has certainly made his music much better than it ever was, and before it was great, so you can imagine.  This CD is a very great buy!  Lyrics, music, it is the complete package!
B00020HEG6|5.0|After listening to this soundtrack again and again and again...I ask myself; How much better can it get?<br /><br />Truth be told, there isn't much room between this and divinity. John Williams delivered a soundtrack that defies possibility (mysterious, emotional, dark, sweeping, epic, funny....)<br /><br />He keeps some music from the first two, yet incorporates more themes and styles that add much more to the score. \\"Buckbeak's Flight\\" is beautiful, a perfect illustration of the scene in the film. \\"A Window to the Past\\" is a very good theme, and is incredibly effective when it is layered with the Patronus theme in \\"Finale.\\"<br /><br />And the underlying theme for me- the one that appears throughout the score, being played in different styles and by different instruments- is \\"Double Trouble.\\" I don't know how many times I've found myself whistling or humming it because it's always in my head. Not because it's annoying (like \\"Its a Small World) but because it's so darn good.<br /><br />So is it perfect? They say nothing is, so I'll suffice to say that this is about as close as it gets.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|I can't believe I'd never even heard about this movie! It was only a few days ago, when I read a novel where this is mentioned, that the idea of the story --a couple of lovers who meet for a weekend, every year for twenty-something years-- caught my attention and I decided to rent it. I loved it. It's funny, moving, and utterly wonderful. Don't miss Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn's amazing performances.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|We recieved a tip from a fan that this movie was really good, so we rented it.<br /><br />WHAT?!?!?<br /><br />It seemed like it was written by people suffering from A.D.D. It doesn't follow at all. Even if you can figure out where the story is going, it's hardly worth the trip.<br /><br />Jon Heder is funny, but I found it thoroughly unamusing (not to mention disgusting) to watch him shoving \\"tots\\" into his mouth, pocket, locker, or anywhere else he can think of.<br /><br />Seriously, if you want a comedy that is at least standable to watch, see Nacho Libre.
B000SQFC0E|5.0|I was impressed with the quality of the movie in HD format.  Of course, the special effects are bad but the movie was still pretty good.  (Note: you need an HD-DVD Player to view movie)
B000065R29|2.0|I immediately fell in love with this film.  It was beautifully acted, and photographed.  But that later changed.  I loved the story of the 2 main characters and wanted to see their relationship develop (by either moving forward or even backward).  Instead (about half way through the film), it was as if the director had run out of ideas.  The plot/film just ran out of steam.  The music cues (once beautiful) now became unintentioinally funny.  The slow pacing became more exposed and obvious (since the story simply stopped) and the film dragged on to it's obvious conclusion.  Overly self conscious.  A shame really, as it started so promisingly.
B000HEVZ8K|5.0|Very good movie but I was very impressed with the quality of the picture, especially considering the age of the movie.  I plan to purchase more \\"classic\\" movies in HD-DVD because of the quality of the ones I've seen.  (Note: you need an HD-DVD Player to view movie)
6302293553|5.0|Review the movie not the features!!! Your reviews effect all versions of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. This is my favorite comedy of all time and people are plaqueing it with review of the quality of the dvd and special features. This not only effects the special edition but the vcr version too.
B000P6XU56|5.0|Very good movie and the quality was excellent.  I've been very impressed with the quality of HD-DVDs, especially with older movies.  (Note: you need an HD-DVD Player to view movie)
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is one of my fav. films.... Well i have most of studio ghibu films... anyway abousolutly should own if really into anime. super cute and makes you wish it never ends.
B000VWYJ8Q|5.0|This is the best of all the Bourne movies.  Non-stop action, for one.  HD quality is great.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes action movies but remember this is the third in a series.  (Note: you need an HD-DVD Player to view movie)
B0010V4TZU|1.0|It's really amazing to me that this band is getting famous. It's not surprising that they get positive press, since the press is beholden to the industry, which essentially picks it's next \\"big hits\\" and then makes it happen through monopoly of distribution and advertising. But it's shocking that people choose to listen to this when there's so much great music being made these days, let alone the original stuff that paved the way back when these fools' trust funds were still in diapers.    Check out Paul Simon! These brats apparently did, although all they (barely) managed to steal was the sound, they got none of the subtlety or depth. How could they? They have nothing to sing or write or play about, they went to college and now they're famous.    This band is terrible - there's nothing there, folks. They can barely play their instruments, the songs are monotonous, and the albums have no character. The vocals are whiny and the lyrics are devoid of substance. \\"Is your bed made? / Is your sweater on? / Do you want to / Like you know I do?\\" Boo.     Vampire Weekend is not an \\"Indie\\" band, they are a product of the industry, without which they would probably be in law school or at an investment bank and no one they went to school with would even remember their band. If you like their music search a little more and find the really creative stuff - it's there waiting for those who seek it!
B000J3OTSM|1.0|Very boring, very predictable, every cliche under the sun. The lame plot might have been bearable if there had been more dancing but there was hardly any. I hated the little brother and was very happy that he got plugged. What the heck was the big brother thinking, giving him money and telling him to take the bus? What an idiot! Everyone in this movie was an idiot.  Nora's Senior Showcase seemed to showcase everyone but her. And wasn't Tyler a senior too? I'm pretty sure you can't transfer into an art high school in the second half of your senior year -- you just don't have the background necessary to graduate. All the boys at that school were wimpy little things, weren't they? Could any of them hold up a partner in a pas de deux? Also, I couldn't tell how much time went by after Tyler quit and then asked to be taken back, but it had to be weeks. So Nora was willing to switch her Senior Showcase dance at the last minute back to one that hadn't been practiced for ages -- seems like quite a risk. Channing Tatum sure is nice to look at; that's about the only nice thing in this entire movie.
B000244FDW|3.0|I have both the A&E and BBC version of this wonderful book and I have to say that I prefer the A&E version. I don't know how anyone can think the 1980's one is true to the book! Um, did you notice that in the book Charlotte's sister and father went to visit her and  Eliza accompanied them? Not to mention all the dialog not found in the book that people kept spouting. Yes, I thought Mr. Collins was better portrayed by the BBC actor, but Mrs. Bennet in the A&E version is a scream. The BBC version kept having to  place dialog where it didn't belong because they spent time inventing lines not in the book and then cramming all the real written dialog into places where I didn't think it sounded right! Not at all as good as I had hoped it would be. I do have to say that this Mr. Darcy a was stone fox! Yow!
B000ZLFALI|5.0|what more can you say? a movie you can watch over and over and over and over and over and over and love every single time.
B001041JLE|1.0|As THE biggest Michael Jackson/The Jacksons/Jackson 5 fan EVER I am disappointed at the treatment Akon, will.i.am, Fergie, and Kanye gave these classic songs.  They took a million carat diamond and turned it into a cubic zirconia.  Perfection never should have been messed with.  Their visions for and performance of the songs just did not work...at all.  The only bright spot to this 25th Anniversary edition is the inclusion of the unreleased track \\"For All Time.\\" For true fans, please stick to the original copy of the World's Best Selling Album of All Time!!!!!  This one is not worth your money.
B000WTBMBK|3.0|I give this three stars because it is not what I expected.  That said, all the songs have pretty much the same drum beat.  Why not just put out a single.
0061142026|2.0|I bought this book after seeing the movie which I absolutely loved. This was the first book I have read by Gaiman and I am so unimpressed I don't think I'll be reading any of his other work.<br /><br />This book felt like he wrote one draft, passed it on to his editor, and had it published. The characters were half formed, the plot meandering, and the conflicts were weak. Characters were given easy outs for every conflict presented to them. In the final conflict with the antagonist(gaiman spends most of the story working up to this) he uses a deus ex machina ending(an improbable turn of events used to resolve the conflict.) The world building was half done as well.<br /><br />The ideas, although original, lacked any real substance. It is very rare that I would ever say this, but if you love a good fairy tale or love story, watch the movie. Gaiman's ideas were expanded on to create a truly magical story.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|The Ark of Truth nicely closes the book on the Ori storyline.  The writing and acting are exactly the kind of quality Stargate SG-1 fans have come to expect.  Standing on its own, it is a must-own for any Stargate fan.  Closes with a few questions unanswered (not related specifically to the Ori), but not in an irritating way like the X-Files movie did.    The cinematography and other production values were WAY better than most of the movies I've seen in theaters in the last few years.  This is not your father's direct-to-DVD movie.      The prelude (which can be skipped entirely, viewed on its own, or viewed as an intro to the movie) was a nice \\"Previously on Stargate SG-1,\\" but it's not enough of a Cliff's Notes to introduce someone to SG-1.      Buy this DVD, and sate your Stargate jones until Continuum is released.

B000Y9KUQG|5.0|It is always a privilege to catch Supernatural (even if I missed an episode).  This show has everything, action, humor and most of all - The Supernatural.  With all elements contributing to the success of the show, it you are interested in possibilities outside of the norm, this show is FANTASTIC!!!!!!
6304712944|5.0|This epic film stands right up there with Errol Flynn's \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood.\\" It is totally filled with the emotion of this part of the Grail Legend. The performances are mannered but the actors always hit their marks. And the cinematography, sets, costumes and music are unparalleled in beauty.    Get this DVD now. A word about the dialogue not being heard in the first part of this DVD. You have to turn on the language on the menu. Otherwise all the music will play. It is a bonus. It says so on the cover.
B0012K1ILW|1.0|I have been waiting patiently, like I'm sure others have as well, for the new Erykah Badu cd. I bought it the first day it came out and ripped straight into only to be very disappointed. This is the worst Erykah Badu CD yet. I even listened to it over again a few times just to make sure my initial reaction was the right one. TRUST ME IT WAS!!!!! I wanted my money back. I could have spent my $11.99 on something better. I am a huge fan of music and I try to support the artists as best as I can, but come on. This cd was so bad that it prompted me to finally write this review. TSK TSK TSK.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Incredible footage showcasing drama of the unseen and unheard world. What an effort by the team to bring this idea into realty that is \\"Planet Earth- The complete series\\". A rich buy from Amazon.
B000FL7CAK|2.0|I rented Season 1 from the library to make sure I liked this series.  I was hooked and it became my \\"workout\\" video.  After completing Season 1, I bought all three seasons for my collection.  I anxiously popped the first DVD from Season 2 into the machine to begin my usual workout and much to my dismay found that even though the shows are in English, the subtitles are only in Spanish and French.  Season 1 and Season 3, however, have English subtitles, furthering confusing the issue of \\"what were they thinking?\\".  What is with that?  Considering it was intended to be my entertainment while I worked out on a treadmill (which is noisy), the lack of English Subtitles was significant.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I saw this movie and although the movie was predictable, the music was wonderfullly done. I ordered the CD soundtrack before I was finished watching the movie! I LOVE THIS SOUNDTRACK! It is a lovely tribute to the original songs, but does not take anything away from the originals. The songs on this CD give me the wonderful feeings that I get from listening to the originals, but they also give me a feeling like I'm listening to something new.  I can not say enough about this CD, except that I highly recommend that any Beatle lover give this a listen. I recommend that you give this CD a listen even if you don't like the Beatles! Like I said, it's got that compliment thing going as well as a new feel.  It's got an extra emotion, soul and 'edge' that I really love in music. Even my young children are liking this CD.
B000WQWPKA|3.0|Just a quick review for everyone looking at the Blu-ray edition of Independence Day. While the picture and sound are fantastic, this disc does NOT include the extended edition, nor does it include the alternate ending. It does have commentary, but it's OLD commentary from a previous edition. (It references things like, \\"gee - this looks different on video due to 30 frames per second\\" which is completely irrelevant at 24fps 1080p HD.) Wait for the double-dip that's sure to follow eventually. In the meantime, hold on to your original ID4 special collectors edition DVD!
B000QUCNOK|4.0|I had no intention of watching this movie (the title put me off a little, especially the \\"story of a murderer\\" bit), but when my daughter started the DVD-player at first I cast a few quick glances over the top of my newspaper. After two minutes or so I laid down the paper and started watching in earnest too. And got mesmerized very quickly by the highly original and fascinating storyline, the breathtaking scenery and photography, the grand performances of the actors and ultimately the way the storyline developed. For more than 1,5 hours I was enraptured. Until the grand finale, the final twist, which in my opinion was a bit of a let-down because it is simply too incredible for my taste and does not fit well with all that had happened before, which is pretty realistic and believable. After the final credits we both felt a little bit disappointed, but not too much. We both agreed that we had watched a really good movie, at least for 98% of its length. The conclusion could have been better. Should have been better. Had I been the director, I don't know how I would have ended it, but for my taste the conclusion was a bit too far-fetched. Definitely a movie you will want to see more than once, though.
B00004R9A4|5.0|Bedknobs and Broomsticks is great for all. It has a wonderful cast, terrific animation and wonderful music. For us older folks it brings  back a lot of memories of when our children were little and is now  perfect for grandchildren and children of all ages.
0143057375|3.0|The book was a disappointment to me after all the Oprah hype. It is interesting, and I am almost finished with the book. However, it is a struggle for me to read, and I feel that I am not understanding a lot of it. I condider myself to be of average intelligence and wonder about the book's appropriateness for the masses, which I think was Tolle's intent. It would have been a lot more meaningful to me if it were told in a simpler, less complicated way. Once I struggle through a few pages, I can sort of see what he's trying to say, so why doesn't he just say it?! I know there's a message in there somewhere - if I could just find it!

B000VWYNNW|3.0|First off, let me say that I don't own this, BUT I do own the remastered DVD.    At the time of this review, this CD set is $22.99.  I just recently paid $15.69 for the DVD set on Amazon - this includes the same exact audio (butchered edits, great sound quality) that's on the CD set.  I just ripped the audio from the DVD and can listen on my iPod, or crank the DVD through my home stereo.  If the CD set was like the original (1976) soundtrack (different edits), with remastering, I'd definitely get the this as well, but it seems like a waste if this version is just an audio copy of the DVD.  On a separate note - I'd pay twice as much for the DVD if they got rid of the fantasy sequences.
1582701709|4.0|Reading the book has been a very thought provoking experience.  It doesn't seem to matter the background of your religion.  It stimulates your faith.  It is a book to read over and over.  I liked all the various contributors.

B0010YSD7M|5.0|I can't tell anyone who doesn't know, like, or love Stagate SG-1 whether they will enjoy this film. I'm just not one of those folks. However, the rest of you should know that this is a truly well executed film. Not only does it serve to encapsulate Stagate SG-1's nonexistent 11th season, but it takes the plot, characters and production values to unseen heights. I encourage you to buy this DVD for your own pleasure, but if not for that, then for the rest of us who want to encourage many more amazing films like this one.
0316166685|5.0|The Lovely Bones wasn't what I expected.  Then again, it's not everyday you pick up a book narrated by a dead girl.  The main character, Susie Salmon, loses her life as the story begins--highly unusual and a huge challenge for the author.  But Alice Seybold rises to the occasion, painting a landscape of love, loss, justice and hope.  Through Susie's ghostly eyes, we see the life she left behind, with the people who meant most--her parents, brother & sister, boyfriend and friends--doing their best to move on.  With a gentle hand, Alice Seybold creates memorable, witty prose as she introduces us to a world--and afterworld--few could imagine.  The Lovely Bones is a memorable read, one that raises questions about life after death, purgatory, heaven--and the bonds we create here on earth. [[ASIN:1592993052 Salmon Run]]
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I just saw this today and I have to admit that it was really good, although this there was one thing that I wasn't expecting and that was the return of an old enemy from seasons 4-8.

0452289963|4.0|I am a little embarrassed to admit that I was one of the millions who hopped on board the \\"New Earth\\" bus, but I found the ride to be interesting. It is pretty New Age, but has depth and is applicable even if you don't completely buy in to it. Keeping in mind that he (Tolle) makes certain pretty strong assumptions that you need (at least temporarily) accept to make it all work, still, there are plenty of contemplative ideas that are worth pondering.  The concept of \\"now\\" can be a bit of a challenge to grasp, but once understood, it is very helpful in getting through sticky situations throughout the day.  There is a lot of terminology, like \\"pain body\\" and \\"ego\\" that could be translated differently in other  psychological/religious/philosophical contexts that perhaps would be more helpful, but all-in-all it is an interesting read.  Try a friend or library first though, because this is a book that is readily available.  Buy it only if you really want to scribble (make meaningful notations) on it or re-read it.
1593080778|5.0|To begin with, a note on the edition.  This Barnes & Noble Classics series version is based on the first edition of The Origin of Species, which is actually nice for a couple of reasons.  First, it allows the reader to experience the book as it originally appeared.  This is not only interesting historically, but a nearly unmitigated virtue because of the second reason: The core content of the book remained essentially the same throughout the later revisions Darwin made in his lifetime, but such changes as he did make were for the most part unnecessary or even (in retrospect) unfortunate--mainly minor concessions to skeptics (religious and otherwise) and to the Lamarckian theory of evolution (as opposed to natural selection as the basic mechanism driving evolutionary change).<br /><br />That said, there are several things to say about the book itself.  First, it is extremely readable.  Modern audiences (especially those educated in the American government schools, which almost certainly failed to introduce them to this material) might be intimidated by the prospect of tackling a somewhat technical scientific volume of this size written a century and a half ago.  Those who attempt it, however, will be pleasantly surprised to find that Darwin's presentation is extremely clear and intelligible, at times even beautiful.  This admirable writing style is in large part due to his scientific method, which leads me to the book's next great virtue.<br /><br />Darwin's approach is primarily inductive--that is, he was not some armchair philosopher abstractly theorizing off in an ivory tower somewhere, as one might suspect from the photograph of him as a bearded old man with which we are usually presented.  In other words, evolution is not \\"just a theory,\\" precisely because Darwin was not just a theorist.  Rather, Darwin gathered massive amounts of evidence on his Beagle voyage, and continued to accumulate ever more (with the help of his scientific colleagues in various related disciplines) for decades before he felt ready to publish his theory (and he still felt rushed into it).  (Indeed, for anyone interested in the philosophy of science, or in epistemology in general, On the Origin of Species should be the textbook case of scientific induction.)  Darwin then presents all of this evidence to us piece by piece, building up his case from the ground, as it were, and in effect recreating his own line of thinking for his reader making it incredibly easy to follow his case.  Which brings us to the third point.<br /><br />What kinds of evidence does Darwin draw on?  Intriguingly, Darwin did not begin his career as a biologist aiming to solve the species question.  He boarded the Beagle as a brilliant amateur natural scientist generally with an inclination toward geology.  Perhaps this is why he was able to draw so widely on various fields in making his case for evolution when that question did become his main interest.  From Lyell's theories and his own geological observations, Darwin concluded that the period of time available actually allowed for a very (previously unthinkably) slow process of evolution.  From this geological perspective, he naturally was able to look at various pieces of evidence more directly bearing on the species question, such as the fossil record and the geographical distribution of species.  After the Beagle voyage, he was able to conduct  experiments in many other areas (and correspond with colleagues about the results of their experiments), including artificial selection (Darwin's pigeons being the most famous example of this) which became important as an analogy for the process of natural selection; the means of the geographical distribution and isolation of species (including seeing whether seeds can germinate after extended periods of submersion in salt water or passing through the digestive tracts of birds); and even the sex lives of barnacles.  All of these experiments are described at some length in The Origin of Species.<br /><br />But Darwin, ever the scientist, was in fact cautious not to overstep the limits of what he could prove.  The Origin of Species contains an excellent chapter anticipating and answering possible objections to his theory, and acknowledging its shortcomings.  For instance, Darwin acknowledges that the fossil record at the time did not tend to show gradual progression from one species to another, and offers an explanation as to why the fossil record might be so incomplete.  He also acknowledges that while he found the evidence for evolution by means of natural selection to be overwhelming, he did not know the actual physical, biological mechanism by which this takes place (as genes had not been discovered and the discipline of genetics created at that time), but he does briefly mention a hypothesis that was actually sort of on the right track.  In fact, in all of these weak areas, subsequent history has borne Darwin and his theory out remarkably well.<br /><br />And finally, in addition to being a masterpiece of scientific thought, The Origin of Species is also a work of, at times, almost poetic beauty, and deserves praise for its literary merit.  After presenting or indicating all the evidence in a specific area throughout each section, Darwin ends each chapter by summing it up in an eloquent statement naming the general principle to be derived from this vast array of specific evidence, often employing an apt and evocative metaphor.  The most famous of these passages is of course the one with which he concludes the book: \\"Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\\"<br /><br />You cannot legitimately consider yourself an educated person if you haven't read this wonderful book, and yet a shockingly small percentage of Americans (including even those who claim to believe in evolution) have read it.  But you will find that to do so is not a chore, but one of life's great pleasures., ever the scientist, was in fact cautious not to overstep the limits of what he could prove.

B000YKE87W|2.0|I saw a video on Youtube of Jonas Kaufmann singing Mozart and I really liked it so I decided to purchase this CD. Unfortunately, this CD was not as good as I thought it would be. He sounds pretty good in the German repertoire. I really liked the WEBER and the WAGNER but the italian selections are a bit hit and miss. In the Italian selections his voice is not really that appealing except in the high notes which sound good. And when he signs piano it sounds really odd. Don't know it just doesn't work for me, maybe he had a bad day while he was recording this. Also, it just might be a voice that sounds better live than in the recording studio. Who knows.
B000VWE5OY|3.0|I love the old and new Dr. Who and the last two seasons of the new Dr. Who are outstanding.  So I bought the Torchwood Series 1 without having seen any of the episodes on TV, just from my love of sci-fi and the carryforward of Captain Jack.  Torchwood's writing is no where near as good as David Tennant's new Dr. Who series.  The sci-fi in Torchwood sometimes takes a back seat to the character drama.  The last couple episodes of season 1 devolved into soap opera. I watched the whole series with my 14-year old daughter.  During these last episodes, we started doing chores while watching, that's how uninteresting they were. And, worst of all, we started (correctly) predicting what was going to happen next. As a sci-fi lover, it's still got some interesting stuff.  But too often, the characters' actions aren't believable.  This is some government funded super-shop, and yet, Captain Jack's employees very frequently act like untrained idiots. Over and Over. And them acting like idiots will take up 20 minutes at a time. Overall, if you love sci-fi excitement, I would recommend David Tennant as Dr. Who as a much better show.  If you like standard sit-com drama, then you may be more appreciative of Torchwood. Oh, and, yes, Torchwood is more \\"adult-oriented\\" than Dr. Who.  But they've said that from the beginning.  Sometimes, the \\"adult\\" stuff works well with a storyline, like when Captain Jack meets his namesake. Othertimes, though, it's more like filler to get the ratings up (sleaze) or it's filler to use up time (instead of good writing).  I really hope that the next season has better storylines, because there's great potential.  I'd start off with killing off all but one of his employees, and the one I'd keep is the 2nd-tier doorkeeper.<br /><br />Happy Reader
B000GFLEB8|1.0|I liked this movie. The cast was pretty good and the acting and story were also strong.    The HD DVD sucks royally. The video quality is like a regular DVD. I saw this using an HDMI connection on a 1080 HDTV on which other HD DVDs have looked much better. High definition discs are still new and I expect it will take some time to improve the technology, but this movie is an exact replica of the DVD version.    I bought this at Best Buy, on sale for almost the same price of the regular DVD. And it is definitely worth less than the regular DVD because I could at least watch a DVD on my blu-ray player when they become somewhat affordable in the distant future. This is why I like combo formats better than regular HD DVDs.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|First I would like to say that this was a completely unexpected reaction to the film.  I loved it, but not for the reasons you would usually say you love a horror picture.  The creatures are only a catalyst to the real horror that comes rocketing through the screen.  The moral precautions about human nature you will take away from this viewing experience is well worth the price of the movie.<br /><br />The acting was very convincing, first of all. Thomas Jane always does well when he is a leading man, very convincing and very raw. The little boy was very good, and Marcia Gay Harden was a bit too convincing! I hated her for real in this thing, to the point where I wanted to strangle her through the TV screen! But seriously she did a great job of being the real villain of the story.<br /><br />This film was far from flat. What I like about it is that it doesn't rely on the CGI and gore factor to carry out the movie like most modern horror tales. It relies on human emotion and storytelling. The story here really has a lot to say about human nature; some of the philosophy and religion discussion amongst the trapped are quite riveting, and really makes think twice about your fellow neighbors.<br /><br />The CGI has been better in other movies. Granted, it is not bad; a lot of it looks quite real, but there are little moments where you say to yourself \\"Yeah that looks fake.\\" Overall though, it is satisfying. It's obvious Frank Darabont has a lot to say here, and he does so quite well.<br /><br />This film goes right onto my category of \\"Best Steven King adaptations.\\" Misery, Stand By Me and The Shawshank Redemption definetely deserve to be there. I would also add a few: for one, 1408, the film from 2007 starring John Cusack. That was a very well done supernatural thriller; anyone who disagrees must watch it again. I would also add Pet Sematary, Dreamcatcher, and The Green Mile.<br /><br />Overall I recommend The Mist. Thank You for reading my review.

B000ZN802W|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie and got very involved in Alex Supertramp's adventure.  He was searching for something that he found, albeit a little late. But the search was exciting.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|This is one of the most perfect films I've ever seen. Unfortunate it had to compete with other great films this year like \\"No Country for Old Men\\" and \\"There Will Be Blood,\\" but I think this is the far greater achievement. The fact that it's a musical may have thrown some audiences, but now on DVD, I hope people will have the chance to really appreciate and enjoy it.     Here's a couple of things to consider as background to this film:    Movie musicals died a long time ago when audiences tired of them. The height were Rodgers & Hammerstein extravaganzas like [[ASIN:B000AP04NI Oklahoma! (50th Anniversary Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B000HT3PGA The King and I (50th Anniversary Edition)]]. Modern audiences thought the whole conceit of characters breaking into song to be just plain hokey. But some films tried a more sophisticated approach: [[ASIN:B00008AOWO High Society]] (1956) was a remake of the witty [[ASIN:B00004RF97 The Philadelphia Story]] (1940) with original songs written for the film by Cole Porter. It's a great movie because the songs were added in small, intimate ways, consistent with the dialogue. There are no giant dance or production numbers. Sophisticated leads Frank Sinatra, Grace Kelly, Bing Crosby and Celeste Holm were allowed to easily slide from speaking to singing, the transitions were cool and realistic, and the music genuinely reflected the characters and situations.     Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd has taken this approach and refined it further. Other reviewers have given you the story and detail, so I'll skip all that. But a real gift of this film has been Burton's ability, with Sondheim's approval and contribution, to change what was a stagebound spectacle into an intimate film with real, relatable characters. The music seems to slide in as a complement to the action and the visuals. Yeah, people start singing, but the entire drama is personal. There is great subtlety in the relationship of Todd and Mrs. Lovett, and this film focuses on that intimacy,while most musicals pull the viewer *out* of the drama. You see this in the way Burton shot the film: in the old days, songs and production numbers were shot to give an audience the feel of the same scene onstage - showy and unrealistic. More recently, directors unfamiliar with musicals used angles very at odds with the action. A good example is Woody Allen's [[ASIN:6305428085 Everyone Says I Love You]]. In this film, he often shot musical sequences with a different technique than the spoken scenes, but it comes across as out of synch. It's a hard thing to nail, shooting people singing. But Burton pulled it off, and brilliantly: in Sweeney Tood, songs are shot as though characters are simply having a discussion with each other.    Really, everything about this film is perfect: the script, and shortened version of songs work ideally for film; the visuals, with Oscar-winning art direction by Dante Ferretti, are breathtaking; cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is quick, exciting, fresh; editing -- especially the hilarious \\"Worst Pies in London\\" -- by Chris Lebenzon is dazzling. The orchestrations are also something unprecedented: this is one of the most beautiful scores ever, but Burton and Sondheim went a step further, beefing up the orchestra from around 35 players in the stage version, to something like 70. The result is an incredible richness and depth, a sound that's so big and so effective, especially against the intimacy of the story and the voices. Orchestrator Jonathan Tunick and conductor Paul Gemignani have created one of the best musical soundtracks in the history of film.     And then of course, is the cast.    Edward Sanders is unbelievable as the boy Toby; he's the right age for the part, and his voice is clear and strong. He's got the right accent and look, and despite playing a tough street kid, his scenes of tenderness with Mrs. Lovett are heartbreaking and convincing. Burton is often portrayed as a gothic/artsy director, but I think people overlook hisbrilliance at drawing poignancy in the most unlikely places. His selection and direction of this great young actor remind us of that.     Jamie Bower and Jane Wisener are ideal as the young lovers: Bower is literally wide-eyed with yearning and wonder, and Wisener is beautiful, innocent and lovely. Again, Burton sketches the story by selecting these exquisitely perfect unknown actors.    And then you have Depp and Bonham Carter. These are two artists at the height of their powers and they are both extraordinary. Depp is an amazing actor, for all the reasons others enumerate here. He is so gifted: he shows us Todd's hard, vengeful crust for most of the story, but softens and nearly seduces Judge Turpin under the razor. Then, near the end, where he realizes what he's done to the beggar woman and who she is, his madness disappears for a flash, and Depp reveals the man Todd once was, his sudden, tragic realization of what he's done, and then, in a flash, it's gone. Few actors have his ability to show such a range of subtle colors and textures. Like the visuals of this film, the first impression is one of grayness and gloom, but on second and subsequent viewings, the amazing amount of detail and subtlety really reveal themselves.      And finally, Bonham Carter. I think the play's hardcore stage fans have unfairly compared her to Lansbury and others. This is an entirely different performance. Bonham Carter finds the subtle, absurd, dry British humor in this character, as well as her very real and touching sadness. She plays it like a drawing room drama, not a music hall belter. And that is the truer and more realistic approach for the modern musical.     Two other great actresses also tried this to different reaction: Audrey Hepburn sang in her own voice in [[ASIN:B000BTGY1O Breakfast at Tiffany's (Special Aniversary Collector's Edition)]] and audiences were entranced with her lovely but imperfect sound. However, Hollywood would not allow her own voice for [[ASIN:630522577X My Fair Lady]], and she was dubbed over. Similarly, Ava Gardner sang her own songs in [[ASIN:B00004RF9K Show Boat]] but again she was dubbed. If you listen to the reissued soundtrack to [[ASIN:B0000033KL Show Boat: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (1951 Film)]], you get the original outtakes sung by Ava Gardner, and you know what? They are far better, more authentic and richer than the dubbed versions. It was a mistake not to use Gardner or Hepburn's own voices, and those films seem dated because of it. In Sweeney Todd, Burton was wise enough to have all the actors use their own voices, and Bonham Carter's interpretation in particular is lovely and personal -- and like everything else about this film, appropriately perfect.     I'm guessing that in DVD many more people will be struck by how great an achievement this film really is. At least, I hope they will be. Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd may be one of those films that did only moderate box office in original release, but will, upon future screenings, be recognized for the landmark achievement it is in the history of film. Every actor, every shot, every edit, nuance, costume and moment -- is perfection.

B0010YSD7M|5.0|This film, the baby of Stargate franchise writer and producer Robert C. Cooper, proves that direct to DVD is a viable second life for Stargate SG-1. While the film manages to just reach \\"big screen\\" production values, it really feels like an extended length episode - and that's not a bad thing. It feels good, and familiar.    Regular viewers know the plot line of this story arc, and want to see the resolution that the Sci-Fi cable channel preempted by canceling the show. The movie does not disappoint here. The loose ends are tied up, with a couple of new twists added to the mix to keep the audience on their toes. All of the character relationships are intact and the canon of the show has not been violated in the slightest. For viewers who know Stargate SG-1, but aren't familiar with the arc of this story line, a \\"Previously on Stargate SG-1\\" extended prelude sequence is provided. As a regular viewer of the franchise, I even found it helpful in jogging the memory of a few plot points from season 9 of the series.    With the actors being completely comfortable in their characters, the performances are just what the Stargate viewer wants. Cooper does a very good job of directing  actors and a story he's very familiar with. The movie was made using film cameras, as opposed to the more recent use of the Hi-Def video format of the series. As good as Hi-Def \\"film\\" is, there IS something about 35 mm film resolution that lends to the big scale feel of the movie. The visual effects, having been completed by Stargate's in-house facility, are familiar and comfortable. But, their scale is wider and more time has obviously been invested in ensuring the visuals live up to \\"movie\\" standards.    The only criticism I would make is that the pacing occasionally DID feel like this was an episode, rather than a movie - a bit ironic in as much as much was made by the producers and cast about how liberating the \\"2 hour\\" format was. Two particular sequences seemed a bit glossed over, with one character setting off without a solid explanation of \\"how,\\" while the situation three other characters find themselves in doesn't get treated with enough depth. But, that is minor, because the third act sets up a scenario that places most of the leading characters into great danger. Even though we know that the resolution will be successful, it doesn't take away from the jeopardy because of the earlier mentioned completely unexpected plot twist. Act 4 resolves the story and set SG-1 up for further adventures in this direct to disc format.    The disc itself has wonderful \\"special features,\\" including the treat of watching the actors, as themselves, at the ComicCon convention in San Diego. Having attended one Creative produced Stargate convention, with the opportunity to meet and hear stories from Michael Shanks and Christopher Judge, I know how much fun the folks at the San Diego convention had.    I feel that my enthusiasm and money was well spent on this film, and that it was worth the wait. I certainly don't find paying such a small price for more SG-1 movies, and I think MGM and the Stargate brain trust at The Bridge have found a wonderful way of keeping the shows alive.  I'm looking forward to the upcoming \\"Stargate Continuum\\" release in July, and hope that the production team can get another film in the pipeline soon.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|I was surprised to hear that Dire Straits' Brothers In Arms had sold 29 million copies worldwide, the 3rd-best selling album of the 1980s, and the 12th best selling album of all time as I had always believed that they were my favorite band. This album is a classic (but not my favorite from them) and contains such masterpieces as So Far Away, Money For Nothing (which is their best song along with Heavy Fuel), and Walk of Life. This is great, but Love Over Gold and On Every Street were even better!
1595141715|5.0|I bought Thirteen Reasons Why for my 15 year old son and 12 year old daughter; both avid readers. My son read it first and told me it was very thought provoking and disturbing at the same time. I read it next and like the narrator Clay,unable to stop listening to the tapes, I could not stop reading this book. I finished it in one day. Jay Asher really makes you stop and think about the reprecussions of your actions toward other people. What may seem like a joke to one person may have irreverible concequences to another. I would suggest it be recommended reading to all middle and high school students by councelors or literature teachers. I will share this book with others.(My 12 year old hasn't read it yet. Some parts are a little graphic for pre-teens but I still feel it is important for her to read it.)
B000ULQV0W|5.0|I will keep this review short.  This is not a Pearl Jam CD.  It does not have the composition of a Pearl Jam CD.  It is what it is...Brilliant.<br />Eddie Vedder took the feel of the book(which I read) and wrote a soundtrack to the essence that it portrayed.  Honestly seperate from the movie this CD could be the soundtrack to a nature hike.  It is the perfect companion when you are driving in your car on a long trip or even when you are cleaning the house.  The songs are mild, yet aggressive.  I would recommend this CD to anyone with good taste in music.  It can be appreciated on several different levels.
0385340540|2.0|The only thing saving this book from one star is that it isn't illiterate or annoying. . . just boring. Had I not lost my book to read on a long plane trip, I would not have bothered with it.     Come to think of it, the Skymall Catalog would have been more interesting.    The reviewer who said this was an excuse to write off a long Italian vacation has it nailed.
B000JJSRNY|5.0|Beautiful music, beautiful people, 1st class voices, and a quality video. You can't miss with this one. There are even unique surprises. Everyone was in top voice, and it was a joy to listen to and watch!

Branson bares his soul with very personal stories - sex, business, money and fun fun fun ... Attention! Readers who are employed might feel the surge of entrepreneurship after reading this book! :-)
0062502182|1.0|Preachy, shallow, obvious.  I kept reading because I figured it HAD to get better, but it didn't.  Basically, it was 200 pages of fuzzy headed \\"follow your dream\\", with an incredibly boring story allegedly going on to prove the point.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|I have been a huge Stargate fan since the beginning.  When the series ended it felt incomplete.  The current story arc was not finished.  This movie did what it needed to do:  it put a satisfying bow on the package.<br /><br />This extended episode has all the elements that made Stargate a phenomenal series.  As always, the writing and dialogue are excellent, the characters have fun and interact well, the sets and effects are what we have come to expect, the plot was fast paced and interesting, and there were balanced amounts of humor and tension and of action and science.  The musical underscoring was superb.  It added to the story, and was delightful to listen to.  And of course, good triumphs over evil, and our heroes ride off to their next adventure, hinting at even more to come.<br /><br />There are only two minor issues with The Ark of Truth.  1.  No Jack.  I really like the new SG-1, but I miss Jack.  2.  As stated earlier, the movie completes the Ori story arc, but it did no more.  It had all the excellent elements of the series, but no more.  As a movie, I would have expected them to go farther than they would in an episode, to be even bigger and better.<br /><br />Overall, I was not disappointed, as I had been with the \\"last\\" episode. Every fan of Stargate will love Ark of Truth.
B000ZLFALI|4.0|Loved this when I saw it at the theatre. Enjoying watching it again and my friends who purchased this video with me are also enjoying it. Great music and characters. Creative way to represent the beatles music of the 1960's
B0010358CG|5.0|Ok, first of all, if you're not an anime-fan, you'd feel a bit lost on what's the big deal with this.<br />If you don't know Shirow Masamune, then you'd definitely feel lost.<br /><br />If you know John Woo and had followed his work...then this will catch your attention. thumbsup.gif<br />Imagine, Mission Impossible 2, Face Off, Hard Boiled, A Better Tomorrow 1,2,3, The Killer, Once a Thief and Hard Target in animation.<br /><br />If you like The Matrix cyberpunk story, this is for you, except its not dark to hide its flaws. This movie actually celebrates details. And details are abound in here. Even if its a close up in the eyes, the mouth, the lips, the jawlines.<br /><br />If your a gamer that starves into details; who spends $500 on a videocard so you can see the textures of those leaves in Crysis, then this movie is definitely for you. This movie does not cut any corners in textures and details. If a character is wearing a leather jacket, you'll see leather. The CGs in this movie is tremendous. I've seen it twice in a 24hr-span I'm still seeing things I've never noticed in the beginning. The motion capture technology is simply amazing.<br /><br />Ok, but does it have a story?<br /><br />Does Jason and the Argonauts have an interesting story?<br />Is it really ground breaking? When Gene Roddenberry introduce the communicator, he brought in the cellphone.<br />Shirow Masamune introduced a theory in sci-fi, brings a story into this, but continues by illustrates it also.<br />It tackles a love story, technology available now and the future, politics, ethics, ideology, and the dilemma that each brings into the story. If you look closely at the armor protections, paddings and vest, you'll see them in current Blackhawk vest, and those riot gears worn by cops worldwide.

B000SZLSB2|5.0|Few are the sophomore albums that turn out to be better than their predecessors. It's the case of All The Lost Souls, an album that may not be for everyone, but works alright. If you liked his first album, you'll surely enjoy this one better. I agree that James Blunt doesn't have the best voice around, and there was too much exposure of \\"You're Beautiful\\", enough not to hear any of his songs again...this time he sounds more honest, warmer and less depressing. I enjoyed \\"1973\\" it has that mellow sound from the early 80s, it reminded me a lot of Andy Gibb...\\"Same Mistake\\", \\"Carry You Home\\", \\"One Of The Brightest Stars\\" are also very good ones, but it's unfair not to mention the rest: The whole album is great, you won't be disappointed!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|This is a great movie which finishes the Ori story from Seasons 9 & 10. It closes many of the open questions. The acting is great, SFX are even better, and there is an incredible story too. I felt there was so much more to tell of the SG-1 story and this movie fills the void. Buy this movie!!!
B0013FDM7E|5.0|This remake of Omega Man (staring Charlton Heston), which itself is a remake of  Vincent Price's The Last Man on Earth, is arguably the best of the three.<br /><br />I watched both of the above movies in preparation for viewing I am Legend.  Each is campy and fun, updated for its own time.  I expected the same from this:  another fun zombie movie.  I was quite mistaken.<br /><br />Although not a die hard fan of Will Smith, I am in awe of his stellar performance in this movie.  It is basically a one man show, and Smith hands-down proves he has the talent and screen presence to successfully pull it off.  It is a riveting performance; one in which Smith lives up to his potential as a cinematic leading man.  His emotions are realistic and run the gauntlet:  anger, humor, hope, love, caring, despair, shock, loneliness, fear. He does it all and leaves you believing.<br /><br />The cinematography of a deserted New York is outstanding, both oddly beautiful and action packed.  The opening sequences grab you and glue you to your seat.  The scenes of Smith hunting on the streets of NYC really drive home just how alone he is.<br /><br />The infected, the CGI vampires, actually made my skin crawl.  All the effects were well done, and allowed the viewer to successfully suspend his disbelief.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great film.  It still affected me days after I had seen it.  And that is exactly what a good movie should do.
0061122416|5.0|This is an incredible book about learning to listen to your heart, and following your dreams and realizing your destiny. If you are open, this book will have a strong influence on you.
0517053616|2.0|Brian Kendig's previous review says it all, but I wanted to add a caveat to a still-potential buyer: the text is so incredibly condensed that the endings of some of the longer lines are scrunched up in awkward brackets in the white space above, making for a disjointed reading of an already unapproachable edition. (Please read the previous review--it's quite helpful.)
B000UBOTG0|5.0|Ramble Tamble is, IMHO, the best song CCR ever did. It hit my stereo in the summer of '70, and its menacing lyrics, combined with a gradually accelerating train ride pace that careened throughout with chugging rhythm section and eerie lead guitar, grabbed my head and gut and wouldn't let go until it finally spun back into its foot-stomping accompaniment to John Fogarty's wailing complaint about modern life. It was a hot summer, what with the War heating up and general craziness in the air, and this song captured the West Coast mood perfectly. And the rest of the album ain't bad, either.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Stargate: Ark of Truth marks the first of at least two movies, direct to DVD, that reunites the cast of SG1.  Daniel Jackson has had a vision of a weapon that will finally give Earth the ability to defeat the evil Ori.  SG1 sets out to recover the item and once and for all defeat the Ori.  This is a pretty standard plot for the series.    Is it very original?  No.  Does it sometimes feel rushed?  Yes, much as the ending to story arcs in the TV show often felt rushed.  Is it a whole lot of fun?  Oh, yeah, you better believe it.  Action, humor, cool special effects, and great characters are all things which permeated SG1 the tv series and the movie is no exception.  As a bonus, more refined cinematography and better sets help the viewer to feel like he is watching a true feature length movie.      The DVD has a few extra features; there is a great segment from a comic convention that is really funny (Browder, Tapping, and Judge answer fan questions), and the making of featurette provides a great look at how the film was made.    If you liked all ten seasons of SG1, you will love this movie.  If you were never much of a fan of the show, or if you didn't like the Ori story arc, then this movie probably won't interest you.  Fans of the show can rejoice; they have a well done Stargate movie in Ark of Truth that delivers all the thrills of the original show.
1400079179|4.0|Very interesting story...even if you saw the movie and did'nt read the book, don't let the movie ruin it for you, READ THE BOOK! The movie did not do it justice.<br />Happy Reading!
B00000K3CR|5.0|This is one of my favorite Tom Hanks movies. It is very funny. A very good movie.
0452289963|5.0|One of the greatest books written. I started reading this book not expecting anything special and I finished it with a whole new perspective. Now truly awakened and accepting life's purpose. This book has done so much good in the world. Thank you so much.
B000QXDEDG|5.0|Look no further if you want to watch the best action movie of the last few years.  The acting is good, the story is great, and the special effects are among the best ever created!  The movie is based upon the Spartan's brave stand at Thermopylae against the Persians , and captures the great fighting spirit of Western Civilization against a barbaric , aggressive Arab onslaught ( sound familiar to today's situation?).  I highly recommend this great movie !
B00005B36H|5.0|I don't how the hell I met Tool some few years ago, but something pulled me to buy this album, and well, I didn't took it on its entire glory.    Now, I have rediscovered it and I can comfirm that \\"Lateralus\\" is one the best albums I ever heard, not only from Tool, but from any Music artist/Band.    Tool is not like any band, that is have to be cleared. They have some powerful aura around their music that takes you very high inside your mind.     Everything in this album is GREAT, from the masterpiece \\"The Grunge\\" to the final \\"Faaip De Oiad\\".    No one can be disapointing with this album.    HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B00003CXA6|5.0|A five star movie that is a tad diminished in the currently released editions due to lack of a complete and full release in DVD.    The 271-minute version is longer than this theatrical version of 254 minutes, which tends to be the one mostly encountered in DVD.  Moreoever, the more extensive Collector's edition, originally sold at a premium price as part of a kit of memorabilia, included the truly longest, most complete version of this great film on VHS (nearly 30 extra minutes), but has never been released on DVD. This version included extended and deleted scenes that were important to story and character development, especially Lee's decision to attack the Union Army despite disadvantageous situation, as well as Buford's defense leading up to Reynold's arrival.  The latter scene is instrumental in seeing the role of Reynolds and knowing more about him and the respect he commanded from his troops(not to mention some fine acting). These scenes should never have been cut. Many fans are anxiously awaiting a full release in DVD format that this truly great film warrants.

B000W746GK|4.0|Warning, this rerelease does not have all the scenes in it for some reason. For instance, when Harry uses flue powder to get to Diagon Alley and ends up in that strange shop, it does not show the Malfoys coming into the store. There are other missing pieces, too. I do not see an extended edition anywhere, so I can only assume these scenes have just been left out. Does anyone know differently?
B00104W8T6|3.0|This album does not hold up well without the film as a backdrop. I generously gave it three stars because it fits Ellen Page's quirky charm. If you haven't seen the film you might wonder what the fuss is about. Garden State's soundtrack stands on its own; Juno's wobbles and wanders from place to place (and genre to genre.) There are classic rock groups (The Kinks, Mott the Hoople, The Velvet Underground) mixed with indie rock/folk (Belle and Sebastian, Cat Power Kimya Dawson) and the result is mixed as well. Without the context of the film The Moldy Peaches and Dawson sound like amatuer hour at a local club. That's fine for the film but serious music listeners deserve more...
B000E1MTY0|4.0|Just as Daniel Craig and the writing crew are bringing a welcome change to the James Bond story, Christian Bale does it for Batman. This is a darker, more thrilling version of Batman and more in the spirit of the Bourne movies (seems like this is the benchmark these days!). Never cheesy, very entertaining. If you've shied away from Batman after the last few in the series, you will definitely climb back on board with this movie.
1416524290|5.0|I also read this all in one night.  I could NOT put it down! King uses his natural storytelling genius to pull in the reader.  Absolutely terrifying! Now if only his newest stuff could live up to his novels like this...
B000OV170W|5.0|This isn't going to be a typical review...I love the book for the record.  Some people have complained about the ending (which I will admit made me gasp because I didn't see it coming).  However, the ending of the book now has a new controversy attached to it:  I just came from a book signing with Jodi Picoult.  She informed us that the powers that be in Hollywood have seen fit to change the ending of the book for the upcoming motion picture starring Cameron Diaz and Abigail Breslin.  She didn't tell us the ending, only said that it was a sappy Hollywood ending that is completely unrealistic.  Many readers may not have liked the ending, but I think we can all agree that Jodi's work should be respected, and changing a major plot point is unacceptable.

0743298039|5.0|This is a brilliant, elegantly written debut novel. Although it seemed to start off a little slowly, before I knew it, I found myself reading through the night, loathe to put the book down, so engrossed was I by the story. Somewhat gothic in feel, the plot will draw the reader in, like a spider to the fly.<br /><br />Margaret Lea, a young bookish woman with a secret that haunts her and a penchant for writing biographies of obscure literary figures, is commissioned by beloved, popular author Vida Winter to be her authorized biographer. Ms. Winter, who has never before said anything about her life that was truthful, now wishes to set her story straight for posterity. While Ms. Lea is initially suspect at the author's request, upon meeting Ms. Winter she feels a connection and agrees to the commission.<br /><br />Thus, Ms. Lea is led into a labyrinth of mystery, secrets, and a most unusual cast of characters.  For her it is a journey that will prove most cathartic and will unlock her own closely held secret. With well-developed, interesting characters and a plot that is simply ingenious, I was riveted by this beautifully written book. Bravo!
0385338724|5.0|I'm a die-hard Sophie Kinsella fan; I'll rarely pre-order a hardback edition of fiction, but Sophie Kinsella's books are an exception. I thought this one was laugh-out-loud funny (as are all her books). The characters pulled you in, especially Lexi; the plot was cleverly executed. The only trouble for me was that it was so good, I read it in a day; then kept thinking about Lexi, wondering what might happen with her next. I recommend this book.
0395389496|5.0|This is a beautiful classic children's book.  It is the perfect gift for any age.
1881273156|5.0|This is a wonderful book! Chapman's insight's are truly inspirational.  Though the book is geared towards married couples, his wisdom can be applied to any of your relationships! His thoughts are clear and his real-life examples are revelant.  It's not 'new' information, but a new way of explaining how we receive and share love! I think it's great and recommend it to anyone in a relationship with anybody!
B000VE439Y|4.0|A little less funny than when I saw it many years ago when if first came out and I had tears and belly aches from the laughter, but it's still a riot.
B0012Q94QW|1.0|For someone like me who enjoys the Zorro movies and the Tomb Raider movies, I have to say... 10,000 BC is just pathetic. Unlikeable characters, terribly inconsistent accents, lame script, GOD AWFUL acting... it's all here. True the effects are good but this viewer needs more. This script needs about 10,000 more years to evolve into something watchable.
B000WCCUZO|5.0|I totally disagree with the first reviewer. This band and cd rocks.  Although the cd sounds low-budget (production) the energy of the band is incredible.  Great vocals and even better melodies.  Get it.

B00104QSOM|5.0|I'm not sure where to begin this review.  I usually start with a summary of whatever I'm reviewing (movie, book, CD), and then go into my thoughts on it.  But how do I summarize this movie?  Daniel Plainview becomes an oil man and is determined to keep his position, no matter what the cost?  Anyone who's seen this film can tell you that such a statement barely summarizes the plot of \\"There Will Be Blood.\\"<br /><br />The movie isn't really about plot, anyways.  I mean, it's there, yes; it's a hell of a story, loosely based upon Upton Sinclair's outstanding 1927 effort, \\"Oil!\\".  But even \\"Oil!\\" wasn't so much about plot as it was about a social concern (as were most, if not all, of Sinclair's novels).  \\"There Will Be Blood\\" (it is definitely Paul Thomas Andeson's movie; he wrote it, he directed it; it doesn't feel much like an adaptation at all) is more about humanity, about one character's \\"growth\\" (I use the term lightly) as he succumbs further and further to his greed.  Daniel Plainview, as portrayed by Daniel Day-Lewis (who thoroughly deserves the Best Actor trophy he took home for this), is a downright evil man.  We are given little motivation for his evil (aside from greed; but we all suffer from that, don't we?) nor should we be given one.  I have heard people complain that the movie is dark, that it is uncomfortable to watch, that it has no redeeming features.  This is all true--thank God.  It is an honest portrayal of a dishonest man, and never once succumbs to the pressure to be a box office sensational feel-good film.<br /><br />I should say a little bit about other aspects of the movie, although if you've already seen it then such a rehash is pointless, and if you're curious about watching it you're already convinced one way or the other.  Paul Dano, as Plainview's \\"nemesis\\" (be warned: such terminology does not apply in a film such as this), is a wonder as always.  Why I've never heard of him, outside of \\"Little Miss Sunshine,\\" I do not know, and is something I aim to rectify.  Kevin J. O'Connor, as Plainview's long-lost brother, is impressive; we can forgive him his turn as the comic relief in cheesy-yet-enjoyable horror fare such as \\"Van Helsing\\" and \\"The Mummy.\\"  Dillon Feasier, as Plainview's adoptive son, is mesmerizing; it's rare you find a child actor with that much depth.  The scenery also becomes a star of the film; shot in part where the recent \\"No Country For Old Men\\" was filmed (Anderson and the Coen Brothers would occasionally disrupt one another's filming), the landscape awes and captivates.  The musical score underlies the depth of the film--something that's been rare in Hollywood, though as of late has been making something of a comeback.<br /><br />Have you made up your mind yet?  I can't blame you if you don't feel like seeing this movie; I was skeptical myself at first.  Even after the film, I had to think a while.  It wasn't until after a month or so that I decided that not only did I enjoy this movie, but that it is one of my favorites.  It's not an easy thing to watch, I'll admit.  Greed is one of humanity's curses; it's a primitive desire, but a powerful one.  \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is a dark, haunting look at one man's submission to his greed--and the life that it takes him through.ctify.

B000002KAT|5.0|It was 1977. My brother bought me this album (on vinyl) for Christmas. Just sort of...of the cuff.<br />It changed my world. This was not nostalgia. I didn't even think about the release date. I dropped the needle and there it was. Perfection. Whatever that is.<br />This record will change your life.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|...and I don't think I had read even one critic's review before going to see this movie. I had high hopes for the movie (for $10, we all would like to enjoy what we see when we go to the cinema, right?), but not exaggerated ones. I too am prone to walking out of films I find unenjoyable, but There Will Be Blood captured me for its entirety. I've read all of the 1 and 2 star reviews, and many people have said character development was poor, or have mentioned the lack of dialogue in the first 10 minutes. I had a completely different experience of this film. The cinematography of Marfa, TX (a place I think most of us would rarely give a passing glance if we drove by) was exceptionally stunning, the musical score disturbingly well-done, and the character development engaging. The focus of this movie is Daniel Plainview (DDL's character). If you don't like 3-hour-long character studies, perhaps this movie isn't for you, but in my view the development of the supporting characters and their relationship to Plainview made his madness and greed all the more believable. Many reviewers said they were \\"waiting for something to happen\\" (which never did). With the Hollywood hype, did people expect explosions, strange plot twists, and unforeseen drama? Apparently. TWBB tracks the course of one man's life; it isn't guided by scintillating plot details or shocking moments--although Plainview is, in many ways, quite shocking. And remember, this is (loosely) based on a Sinclair novel, so how much \\"action\\" are you looking for in turn-of-the-(19th)-century scripts? I don't want to be one of those people who tells others they \\"missed the point\\" if they did not see the value or beauty of this film, because it feels unfair. What I will say, however, is that it is very literary (if not \\"intellectual\\"...though not in a high brow way), and takes some investment from the viewer to be properly enjoyed. My best experience watching this film was in a theatre all by myself--no lines, no smacking of popcorn. And it was perfect.
1594489505|5.0|This book was Beautiful, touching, heart-wrenching, satisfying, and PERFECT. Honestly I have to say this was the best book I ever read! My biggest complaint is that Khaled Hosseini needs to honor us with more books! I am currently reading kite runner, but Thousand Splendid Suns has really touched my heart, opened my eyes, effected my life, and it will stay with me forever. It is about two women's lives in Afghanistan. Their problems, their desires, and their changing lives. The story is wonderful and the words are poetic. Trust me read this book. I have never felt so passionately about any book before and I have walked around begging everyone I know to read this because I think it is that important.
B0012Q94QW|2.0|How about there being Egyptian Nile boats that weren't<br />invented until 5000 years ago? Or there being horses<br />in the movie which seems to take place in Africa?<br />They weren't domesticated until about 4000 years ago?<br />How about that Mammoths were pretty much a \\"northern\\" European,<br />American and Asian prey animal and not really hunted in Africa?<br />So before we get to the climate change idea this movie<br />is at the level an old B movie of the Tarzan type; fake natives,<br />costumes and plot... not really sci fi,<br />because it has completely ignored both history and science.
1881273156|5.0|My only regret is not having this book 39 years ago.  My wife and I have a good marriage, but I expect the next 39 to be even better.  Should be a must read for all newlyweds.
B00004W4LM|5.0|Propaganda was perhaps the best of the 80's.   I know I'm still listening to them and enjoying them as much now as I was then.  This collection of remixes might actually be more fun than A Secret Wish.  But regardless, it should be part of your collection.      This is ZTT at their best.
B00003E43X|3.0|\\"Moody Blue\\" was the last album Elvis released before his death.  It was a huge hit worldwide after his passing, peaking at 3 on the album charts in the US and UK and going all the way to number 1 on the US Country Album chart and staying there for 10 weeks.  It would eventually be certified MULTI-PLATINUM by the RIAA.  Most of these songs were recorded at Elvis' Graceland studio. Elvis was poor health during these sessions and also apparently suffered from depression which affected his motivation. Because of this, Elvis' producer, Felton Jarvis, did not have enough studio recordings to complete album and ended up using some live recordings to fill out the album. Despite these problems, this collection includes several strong performances.<br /><br />The song \\"Moody Blue\\" was also a Top 40 hit in the US but went all the way to number 1 on the Country charts and number 3 on the Adult Contemporary chart, before Elvis death. It reached number 6 in the UK.  \\"Way Down\\" was released and moving up the charts just before his death. After his death it quickly moved into the top 20 on the Pop chart and was another number 1 Country hit. It would also reach number 1 in the UK and stay there for 5 weeks!<br /><br />Despite its flaws, this is a very good collection and a must for Elvis fans.
0763627410|5.0|This book is colorful without hurting your eyes, simple but with lots to talk about and see... It appeals to both my 3yr old and almost 22 month old.  They love the rhyming, counting, and \\"spying\\" all the different fish.  They enjoy the ending best of all!  Definitely a favorite at our house!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is an outstanding series, I strongly recommend it. The BBC DVD version has David Attenborough's commentary which I always enjoy, and each section is followed up by an \\"inside look\\" at how the filming was done, and this was equally fascinating.   I agree with other reviewers-the music in the introduction (only) tended to drown out the commentary, but no problems after that.
0375846735|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the whole trilogy of \\"His Dark Materials\\" .  Not only are the books a cracking good read from an entertainment point of view, but Pullman bravely presents a theory of religion that is wonderfully refreshing and honest.    Yes, it does appear that Pullman has a Gnostic view of  the God of the Old Testament, and he does indeed present the domination of the \\"Church\\" in a rather dim light, but let's face it - if we look at the history of the Church and it's savage dealings with suffering mortals through the ages - then Pullman is not saying anything that isn't absolutely true.  It always astounds me how people can forget about the many thousands of people who were horribly tortured and burned alive by the Inquisitors in service of the Church.  How many people were executed because they had the temerity to discover something that didn't agree with suffocating church doctrine.  It is appalling - yet all forgiven and forgotten in some strange anesthesia of the group mind.  Would people be so forgiving of Hitler ?  I think not.    Pullman's trilogy is a completely unique fantasy, and I was sorry to finish it.   It will be a classic along the lines of Lord of the Rings.  I particularly appreciated Pullman's black and white sketches at the beginning of each chapter - proving that he is an artist of many talents.  Highly recommended.
015204907X|5.0|My 9 month old may not understand the story or appreciate the language but, boy, do the illustrations keep her glued to every page! Bold black outlines and lots of curly-cues for the sheep's wool. This book has been holding my squirmy one's attention for going on 3 months now. She loves the Near Sheep the best. But that's because she's a baby and likes things near! Thanks to this book, \\"sheep\\" may be the first word she'll learn how to read.  My only criticism, alas, would be the language. The rhymes are lovely and adults won't get tired of reading them. The thing that worries me (only a little bit) is the way adjectives are made out of words that aren't really adjectives: bath sheep, bed sheep, up sheep, down sheep, far sheep, near sheep, car sheep, train sheep, etc. Okay, these may be neologisms and I'm being too much of a strict grammarian or maybe I'm just reading it incorrectly.   Whatever the case, I'm still giving it five stars because it is definitely a hit with this mom and her baby.
B00004RF8J|5.0|I remember watching this movie when i was a kid so i bought it for mine.  My kids laugh just as hard as I always did.
0375424474|5.0|This is a great book that illustrates our link to lower animals, fishes and bacteria via paleontology and the structure of bodies and DNA. There are also great explanations for how paleontologists search for fossils, and how DNA tests are setup to prove a result. The book does not go into deep scientific detail and is easy to read by a layman. Nice work Shubin.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|Excellent Blues Tribute to the some of the well-known and lesser-known \\"Fathers of the Blues\\".    Kudos to KWS for putting together such an outstanding tribute and rewarding his fans with a terrific bonus DVD.    The DVD alone is worth the price of admission.  Thanks, Kenny.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I get this cd for my wife birhday, the item is brand new, excelent condition, and on better price then regular store.
B00005QW5X|4.0|I won't repeat the summaries of this film -- I only want to say it is much more than a cult film but is more exciting and intriguing and fun and sad than most films out there.  Unfortunately even New Line decided to market this as a niche product -- comparing it to the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Without knocking that film, which is a phenomenon of its own, Hedwig is in a different league.  While the style of Hedwig's band owes a lot to camp and to glam rock the film itself is never campy.  It has the music and power and vision of some of the great musical celebrations like The Wall and The Commitments, but has a more intimate feel than either of those.  It is, in style, closer to a documentary, and after watching this you will swear that Hedwig is not merely an invention of the actor and director John Cameron Mitchell but has a life of his own.<br /><br />Apart from enjoying the film quite a bit, I was also quite happy when I noticed that the song \\"The Origin of Love\\" is a retelling of the story Aristophanes tells in one of the most exciting of ancient books, Plato's Symposium -- of how in the beginning we were created as a unity of two and the gods saw that the contentment this generated made us too powerful and divided us, so that love is the longing for our other half.

B00065MDRW|5.0|One I've been meaning to buy for about 20 years or so (first time I heard it). Queen also does a version of \\"20th Century Schizoid Man\\" on an album called \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\", but I prefer the original.  If you like the old school stuff this doesn't have a bad song on it.  Kinda in the Pink Floyd spacy catagory, except for the song mentioned above which rocks hard.
1416523359|1.0|I am a Stephen King fan, that's why I initially kept plugging away at this book, thinking it would eventually get better.  But it never did.  This book had it's own language, the \\"bool\\", the \\"bad gunky\\", etc., ENOUGH ALREADY!!  It made the book seem downright CORNY.  Also, it continually jumped from here to there, leaving the reader confused.  I should have read the reviews on it first before I began reading it.  At least I got it from the library and didn't waste my money by buying it.
0316174483|5.0|We got this for my 6-year-old daughter.  She has used it well.  There are so many things to do in the book that she hasn't gotten bored.  We haven't had much luck finding washable stamp pads that easily wash off her fingers though!  Her stained fingers are worth it though!!
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Michael Moore opened my eyes to a dilemma of which I was already somewhat aware.  I have worked as a nurse for many years most of it in community nursing but have also worked in the insurance industry.  I had no idea how politicians play so much a part in how and IF someone gets health care.  While today I met a patient who had to pay over $300 for 20 pills one of the giant insurance company's CEOs is making over $1.6 billon yes BILLION dollars per year.  If you haven't seen this, it is definitely a must see.  Then make yourself aware of the bills currently before any Congressional session and do your part by contacting representatives and congressman so that this atrocity can be stopped.  Universal Health Care is something to consider, but watch the movie, you will understand more of what I am trying to convey.
B00005JNS0|5.0|The aspect I like most about \\"Cars\\" is that there is no villain (unless you count the nasty green race car, but he is such a small part of the movie, that he is easy to ignore) and almost NO crude or stupid humor (which is what I hate most about modern television).  All you have is a selfish young car that learns to love others and to value people and friendships.  He learns this from \\"normal\\" everyday cars that care about each other and come to care about him.  The show just makes you feel good about what you can do to be a good friend.  The ending just puts a great big exclamation point on the theme of the whole movie.  I loved it.  This is what movies should be like.  Oh and did I mention that it is FUNNY!
184195425X|1.0|The moral of this story is that you should believe whatever nonsense you want if it makes you feel better. Some people who loved this book like that moral. Such a moral abhors me, so I cannot score this book low enough.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|Really delightful adaptation.  Some people have gotten upset about the liberty taken with Catherine's fantasies...enough that the American release has been edited by 10 minutes.  For some reason, we can watch a grind pool on MTV but not see Catherine's naked back!  Go figure...JJ Feild is a charming Henry Tilney and the last kiss is probably the best captured on film!  Perhaps not the most stringent adaptation but definitly captures the light satiric tone Miss Austin favored.  Highly recommended.
B0000000KW|5.0|What a strong cd, Ringos first cd from rehab and what a come back, It rocks and its fresh.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|I bought this after watching Arcade Fire on Austin City Limits. I cannot imagine a more high-energy stirring show on a small studio stage. The music just blew me away coming from so many unusual instruments played in frenetic activity. It's hard to place their music but I felt strains of Talking Heads, Sugarcubes/Bjork, Cranberries, rockabilly and folk music. The music and lyrics moved me. Their songs seem to talk about big and deep things. The music is often just as hard and powerful. AF has a unique sound--once heard you will not confuse them with any other band. My favorites are the anthemic Antichrist TV Blues, Black wave, Ocean of noise, Windowsill but there is not a single song I would skip on this album. I also bought Funeral after this and it is just as good with Wake up, Haiti, Rebellion.
B000007MVU|3.0|Your mom will love this one, Tats who Ringo did it for His Mother. A big band sound.
B00008977N|5.0|This has all the essential elements of a great concert DVD. Inspired music from musicians at the top of their game having fun on stage. Simple yet effective thematic props and visuals. An audience loving every minute of the show. Camera work focused on the performance and the performers with no backstage or offstage shots and just enough views of the audience to give a good feel of being there without being distracting. Peter Gabriel and his band put on a great show. Every member of the band is right in there. Paula Cole makes this show extra special. Her vocals are superb. She has a magnetic stage presence right from when she first appears on the excellent opening number Come Talk to Me. The picture and sound are very good and the specials are fine.
0375423877|5.0|How charming are these books!  I have a confession to make - I've never really cared about traveling all that much, and especially not to somewhere as remote and foreign as Africa.  But that has very much changed with Mma Romotswe and Alexander McCall Smith's accounting of her.  I now harbor a secret dream of visiting Botswana and the Kalahari.<br /><br />This first in a series is delightful; Mr. Smith is a true craftsman.  He manages to bring us the world at a much slower pace, one that can be very difficult to understand in this country.  But he does it while maintaining the integrity of his characters.  While they may have a simple way of viewing the world, the characters in this book (and the others that I've read) are not one-dimensional simpletons.  Smith manages to weave the problems of today into a culture that isn't necessarily ruled by time so strictly as in the western world.<br /><br />And while there are many \\"mysteries\\" in this novel, the detective agency is more about human nature and the problems we create for ourselves.  Mma Romotswe just manages to ponder and resolve some of these issues, while dealing with the problems that arise from daily living.  What a fun book.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|I am a recent fan of AF and started with Neon Bible. This debut album reminds of the feeling of pure raw driven energy I heard in the first efforts by The Cure, U2, Cranberries and Talking Heads. This is not to say AF's sound is similar to those bands but that I heard unique genuine compositions coming from the heart with potential for greatness. Those other bands went on to more polished sophisticated and popular work but the early stuff containing the seeds of success has an unadulterated feel that cannot be matched. My favorites are Wake up, Haiti, Rebellion. Even after weeks of repeated listening I'm still overcome when Regine begins \\"Haiti, mon pays ...\\"
B000002JSJ|5.0|Immediately I would like to say that I am giving this album 5 stars only and ONLY for one song Achilles Last stand, which is one of the greatest songs definitely Led Zeppelin has ever written... it's just brilliant, defintely listen to it by all means... it stands near these masterpieces as Kashmir and Stairway To Heaven... the rest of the album though is honestly not worth listening... probably Candy Store Rock and Tea for One are presenting something worth your attention... but the rest is just boring, though probably it's necessary to listen for those people who have never heard of the album, so they could decide for themselves whether it is worth spending time on the rest of the album... I bought Presence only for Achilles Last Stand... not for its whole content!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Got my copy yesterday, watched it last night. In short, it's really damn good! If you've watched Stargate over the years you'll not want to miss this.    No spoilers here, but they do a decent job of tying up the loose ends in the Ori saga, or at least as good a job as you can do in 1.5 hours. Remember, it took them 40 episodes over 2 seasons (30 hours of video) to lead up to this, so in some ways I with they'd taken at least 120 minutes to tie it up, but it's still well worth the watch. It's got all the classic interplay between the characters, the comedy, the tension, the action, it just reinforces why we all loved this series, and how nuts SciFi was to not renew it. Maybe they'll see the error of their ways? :)    Production quality is superb, the wide shots w/the mountain ranges are amazing, and as several have said, only a feature affords them the time and $$ to make shots like this. Special effects are great, and some of the explosion scenes are quite interesting, especially after you watch the DVD extras and see how they did it.     Speaking of bonus material, the bit at comic-con is absolutely hilarious. Gary Jones (Chief Mst Sgt. Walter Harriman, you know, the \\"receiving IDC\\" guy) MCs it, and while I get the occasional chuckle out of SG1, I had a couple of out-loud laughs at this Q&A w/the cast of SG1 (well, except for  Michael Shanks (Daniel) who was, well, you'll see).    One thing... please, please, please tell me they filmed this in HD and there will be a BlueRay Director's cut released after Continuum later this year.    Bottom line... BUY IT NOW!
B000WC3AOE|5.0|I feel compelled to give this 5 stars immediately, and find it odd that Amazon would continue to lower the overall average by including a negative rating by someone who could not view the product when attempting to play it in a devise for which it was never intended. At any rate, anyone who is at all interested in the glory days of old Hollywood (particularly musicals) will thoroughly enjoy this. As with the original theatrical releases, Parts I & III are the real gems (II was rushed into release to capitalize on the success of the first and is the weaker of the three but still has it's moments including the rare paring of Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly). The high definition fan may be a little disappointed by some of the footage (it's had to make some old grainy black & white film look great) and by the constant shifting of screen ratios (from 4:3 to 16:9 and even wider) but it is all handled as smoothly as possible. The extras and interviews all add greatly to one's appreciation of a truly American art form and a period that's gone forever.
0316113506|5.0|I've read a lot about the brain in the last decade, and I thought this book was the most helpful summary I've seen of what to do differently. The thinking person is the person who aerobically exercises regularly.<br /><br />Spark is an excellent summary of the brain research during the last decade or so that has added to our knowledge of how regular aerobic exercise stimulates better and more effective mental activity. Dr. Ratey considers the impact of such exercise on school-age children . . . and adults with stress, anxiety, depression, attention deficits, hormonal changes, and aging bodies. He also recommends a general exercise regime that seems to optimize what we know today from these studies.<br /><br />The essence of the book can be found in the observation that optimal brain functioning requires plenty of blood, the right nutrients, a balance of body chemicals designed to help the brain operate, and an ability to grow new cells and connections in the brain. Each of these elements is helped by regular aerobic exercise. The results are often measurable within a few weeks.<br /><br />So if you thought that aerobic exercise was simply about looking and feeling good, you're wrong. It's also about thinking well and being able to learn. There are longevity and other quality of life benefits as well . . . including reduced incidence of disease and less chance of dementia.<br /><br />The book also explores that you don't have to do a tremendous amount of exercise to get most of the benefits.

B0011NVC9I|4.0|I agree with some of the reviewers' comments about Angelina Jolie, she is incredibly overrated, and I'm so tired of having her \\"perfection\\" shoved in my face.  I realize I'm in the minority here.  She actually looked better in CGI than she does in person.  They obviously tweaked her figure to make her even more attractive.  Most people don't seem to understand this... they think what they saw on screen was a 100% faithful representation of her real body.  Her face, yes... her figure?... no way!  I'm sure \\"adjustments\\" were made here and there.  Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't push her out of bed in the morning either, but I can find at least a dozen other actresses who are far more attractive and desirable.    And let's face it... Ray Winstone (Beowulf) looked nothing like his CGI character either!    With that out of the way, I thought Beowulf's character was very well written.  He was a flawed character, arrogant and sex-obsessed.  His desire for women became his undoing (I can relate to that haha).  His lack of will power, and always thinking with the wrong head got the better of him.  I read the original text (I own the Seamus Heaney translation), and I thought the script changes were genius.  Connecting the dragon to Grendel's mother and his past sins was brilliant.  In the end, he redeemed himself by slaying his son and saving his kingdom.  And Grendel's mother?  She still lives in that somber cave, waiting to tempt mankind once again.  And for those saying the ending left the movie wide open for a sequel, I completely disagree.  No sequel necessary, we \\"get\\" the ending!    Anybody else out there think his son looked like an Oscar statue? :D
B000Y7U98W|5.0|The movie is one of the most beautifully moving and cinematic Science Fiction films I have ever seen. The acting is superb and the story is strong. By the end of this movie I was left speechless and all I could think was \\"wow\\".
B000003JA7|5.0|As I pulled out my LP to burn it to CD now that I have the capability, it was amazing that this album reached me the same way it did in 1972 when I first purchased the vinyl.  I'm glad I was able to keep it in good enough shape to copy, despite multiple interstate moves over the last 30+ years.  Ian Anderson managed to make music that was unique.  He showed a generation that there was more to rock and roll than a lead guitar, bass guitar, drum set and maybe an organ or sax.  To Jimmy Page they may have been \\"Jethro Dull\\" but Anderson's music probably touched a much wider range of people and was certainly more imaginative and creative.
B0010V4TZU|4.0|Vampire Weekend is not going to be the next \\"super\\" band.  Their songwriting isn't fantastically complex, however it is \\"fun\\".  Don't buy into the hype and expect something that this DEBUT album is not.<br /><br />Expect a good extremely easy to listen to indie/pop rock album, and enjoy it for what it is.
B00030DEQE|5.0|Not much to say, it is a network card that works on 1Gbps speed over not so professionally done network (I did wiring myself, wires and terminations mix of CAT6 and CAT5e, with wire lengths up to 40 feet).
B000CNFC76|5.0|This is one of those stories that makes you feel good, and is filled with inspiration and hope. This movie is great for almost any age, entertaining, and even a bit educational (economic-class discrimination, and common attitudes pertaining social-order at that time, are highlighted). Overall, a big thumbs-up for this movie -- a good, inspiring, family film that basically says \\"follow your heart\\".
B000R7HY0K|5.0|I think this is brilliant film, meshing Grindhouse cinema attributes with classic Tarantino style. Sufficiently gory, nice little comedic moments (yes, they're in there), and a smash-up ending. If you don't like talky films, then you probably shouldn't even watch anything by Tarantino. His characters talk. Period. Death Proof is no exception, but the entertainment factor never goes away. I saw this on Starz and now I'm here to buy the DVD.
B00003CXRM|1.0|I love comedies. When someone told me this was the funniest movie they ever saw I had to see it. I'd rather get a root canal before watching it again.
0307394549|5.0|I love baking and I love cookies.  That's what encouraged me to purchase this book and I'm so glad I did.  There are around 175 recipes; I now have enough cookie recipes to last a lifetime and all the new possibilities of flavours makes my head spin.  I am so glad to see she made ANZAC cookies (something really popular in New Zealand and Australia).  They are so devine and definately worth trying.  I also love the Lemon-Apricot Sandwiches and the Chocolate Meringues.  There are fantastic pictures to go along with them all (making them all the more tempting) and I can't wait to make more than the three I've done already.  It's a good way to broaden your taste bud horizons because the variety is endless.  I also find her instruction easy to follow which is so important.  If you are someone who loves baking and want to try some old favourites or new kinds, it's one of the better books I've seen.  I love it and imagine it will be used many many times down the road.
B000YPUFA6|1.0|One star because I cannot give it no stars.     A feeble excuse to move from one fight/shooting/zombie scene to the next. No plot. No story. No excuse.     The laziest excuse for a movie I have seen in a long, long time.
B000YB4G32|5.0|Sawdust is one of the most creative and interesting albums I have ever run across. The Killers are showing their incredible talent through range of musical styles, emotion and complexity delivered in every song. They totally surpassed my expectations - I am simply blown away by this work.
B00130UFY2|3.0|When I run out of TIVO shows to watch nice alternative to watch or going out to rent, just download. Wish it had a longer viewing time then the 24 hours from the start of viewing.
B0006JGFNQ|4.0|I bought Gizmo for my girlfriend.  When she was a child she wanted one for a pet but didn't know he wasn't real.  This stuffed animal is the closest thing she can get.  He's cute, huggable, and \\"sleeps\\" on the pillow next to her at night.
B000002H70|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet. This is one of the greatest albums of all time. Unbelievable instrumentation, amazing lyrics, flawless production. You cant go wrong with this CD. Even if you aren't a Cure fan, you should pick this up for the sheer musical brilliance.
B000QFCD5O|5.0|I saw ASIA's concert during the first leg of their reunion tour in September 2006, at the House of Blues Cleveland.  The performance was as great that night as it is on this CD and DVD (GET THE DVD TOO!). This concert is in the top three best concerts I've ever seen.<br /><br />I'll never understand all of the people who feel the need to write hateful (and worthless) reviews of this or any other talented performer, doesn't seem very objective to me.<br /><br />I was only 10 or 11 years old when ASIA's first album was released. Seems like only yesterday when 'Only Time Will Tell' was in regular rotation on MTV ...AAHHH - the good old days. Being that young, and having parents who weren't really into any kind of music. I never knew anything about the past history of the ASIA members. So all of these complaints and comparisons to ASIA's Progressive Rock roots don't really mean anything to me. The complaints seem especially silly when, truth be told, ASIA was formed to be a hugely popular, album-selling monster (and that's not a bad thing!). ASIA makes great rock and roll, period. So save your hate for performers without talent ...there are PLENTY to choose from nowadays!<br /><br />Anyway, I'm glad the Original ASIA is back together, and I hope they keep rockin' for many years to come.  Oh, and I LOVE the acoustic versions of 'The Smile Has Left Your Eyes' and 'Don't Cry'. Carl Palmer is the KING of all rock'n'roll drummers!
B0010358D0|2.0|This looks very good. The visuals are amazing on an HDTV. I am about 30 mins into the movie and I have to say that the story, acting and animation is horrible.     First the actors from the first do not lend their voices to this one.   Some of the characters seem to be different than from the first movie. The acting is pretty stiff and cliche (the tough cyborg guy is annoying).  Some of the fights are just stupid for stupids sake. I mean does Duenan and Briarious need to spin and do cartwheels while shooting? It doesn't even look cool, just stupid.    Why did they go with CGI models 100% this time? Did the old animated cells not work anymore? It sure looked a LOT better.    The events from the first movie don't even seem to play a part at all which is a shame.    I loved the first movie but I wouldn't consider this deserving of the same name. I will be selling this shortly as I regret buying it.    2 stars just because if you mute it, it looks very sharp.
B000WQWPKA|1.0|Boycott Blu-Rays that do not come with Speacial Features like the Standard DVDs do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!       They brag about how much material a Blu-Ray Disc can hold and yet they omit all the material that a Standsard DVD Special Edition has.
1400064287|4.0|The book delivered on its claims.  These concepts can be applied to selling a new idea, product or service both internally and externally.  For a company that has very traditional marketing techniques it would be very helpful to pass this along to the marketing and communications staff so that they can shift their paradigms and embrace these concepts.
B0011NVC9I|3.0|I was expecting an exciting action/adventure movie but what I got was a mediocre film with bad acting and a weak plot. I found the movie to be quite boring actually. And don't believe the hype about the so-called Angelina Jolie nude scene. She's animated! Cartoons don't count.
B000002GI0|5.0|John Hiatt's 1988 release \\"Slow Turning\\" is a hands down classic.  This was my introduction to John Hiatt after I heard the uptempo rocker \\"Paper Thin\\" on the local radio station.  I soon discovered that this CD was one solid set of songs that were easy to listen to all the way thru.  I just happen to listen to this great album the other day on my iPod while driving back from a worksite with a group of co-workers.  It had been awhile since I listened to this classic, and towards the end I remembered just how good it is.<br /><br />The album kicks off with a few up-beat songs featuring great acoustic and electric guitars.  John's backing band is very tight, with good production.  \\"Icy Blue Heart\\" slows things down to a crawl, but what a great country-tinged ballad it is, telling the story of a couple who meet in a bar.  I hadn't heard John's previous album to this, Bring the Family (1987), until recently.  Many consider it his best, but I prefer Slow Turning because it rocks just a little more.  The great songs just keep coming at you, and the beautiful closer \\"Feels Like Rain\\" is one of my favorite slow songs.  It brings back memories of when I lived in Louisiana near New Orleans.  If you listen to the song, you'll understand.  If your thinkning of trying out some his music, you can't go wrong with this one.<br /><br />*****Highly RECOMMENDED*****

0743454537|2.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend.  I began reading it on an airplane and feel I should have stopped after about 30 minutes when I sensed this wasn't going to be anything very uplifting. Because it was a long flight I kept reading. The flight was just as long on the way home, so I read.  Whereas the author writes with an easy -to -read type of style, I did not appreciate the constant back and forth between past and present. And I'm sure she was trying to be accurate with the correct names of treatments, meds, disease terminology, etc., but it got to be too much.   I lost a brother to leukemia just under 3 years ago. My other brother's wife died of metastatic melamona nearly 1 year to the day after his death. If you have had recent illness or death in the family, I would stay away from this book.  The ending is not only heart wrenching, but depressing. Yes, sometimes life sucks, and this is not what you should read if you've gone through tough times recently.
B000002UAU|5.0|For me, Sgt. Peppers and Pet Sounds are the two best albums of all time.  And I would never put them in any particular order or compare them.  For some Beatle-nuts it's really hard to warm up to Brian Wilson's glorious masterpiece.  But both albums are ridiculously good...  For there own separate reasons.   Buy both, if you don't like Pet Sounds, then you have no heart.  If you don't like Sgt. Peppers, you have no spirit.  If you hate both, you have no soul.
0321544080|3.0|I'm not sure what I was expecting from this book, but after reading reviews I guess I was expecting something that blew my socks off. It's not a bad book, but it's not one that I'd bother reading through a second time. As long as you purchase this with the understanding that you're buying a collection of photographs and not an educational book, you'll likely enjoy it. It's great for a coffee table or the bathroom as you can read a page or two and put it down (it's not an on-going story, each page stands alone).
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I received my DVD this afternoon and popped it into my computer moments later.  Wow there is no disappointment here.  It's an awesome movie.  It's a great plot with excellent writing, great effects, and the usual excellent acting and directing with most of the characters we've grown to think of as part of our family.  I loved the film and look forward to the next, and hope they will not end the SG-1 franchise there.  The only thing that could have made the film better would have been an appearance by Jack O'Neill.  This is a must buy for anyone who is a scifi fan.
B000YXMMAE|3.0|Props to Justin Quick for his rather clever observation:     \\"... is Thom Yorke turning into one giant wailing vowel? Seriously! The album should have been called AEIOU and sometimes something coherant.\\"     I have duely noted that his review was useful but there's no way to say how funny that comment was to me except to write about it here.     Let me add that evidence of the stagnation of Radiohead's sainted singing dude was obvious in his terminally uneventful solo release --- unfortunately the utter lack of distinctiveness has carried over to the rest of Radiohead's holy players on this release.    Even though Radiohead's collective hearts are in the right place, and even though they generally deserve the canonization that they have received from their faithful, myself included, there is still no getting around the fact that this record is generally dull and uninteresting.
B00005UOXL|1.0|The original album's cover has Billy in an '80s Oriental shirt, and the last song was \\"Congo Man\\". Bring those elements back, and I shall grant this album 5 stars. Until then, I don't care how many times you remaster it, it's still being used as a tool to sell \\"Dancing with Myself\\", which stains the beautiful vibe of this album. Is there any guitar work on this planet that can match \\"Shooting Stars\\"? Billy, there ARE actually fans of \\"Congo Man\\" out here, and I'll even go so far to say it's \\"part 1\\" of \\"The Dead Next Door\\". I'm WAY beyond fed-up with the \\"attention shoppers\\" attitude of Billy's marketing dept., mostly because it puts us true fans in the back seat.
0385338724|5.0|When 'Remember Me?' came out, I was initially sad that it wasn't the next in the Shopaholic series. Once I began to read 'Remember Me?' those feelings disappeared. This book is a very fun read! The plot is quite intriguing- Lexi wakes up in the hospital from a car crash and cannot remember the last 3 years of her life. During those 3 years, she has become a totally new person- definitely not the \\"old Lexi.\\" How did she become this new person so completely different?<br />As always, Sophie Kinsella's writing is a joy to read. The writing is both stylish and engaging.<br />I, along with many other fans, wait anxiously for the next Shopaholic adventure...but for now, am happy with reading 'Remember Me?'.
B0015HS5TA|3.0|For me, the most enjoyable element in Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day was the relationship between Miss Pettigrew (Frances McDormand) and Joe (Ciaran Hinds).  Joe designs fashionable lingerie but from the start seems detached from the rest of high society and the fashion world; he's weary of it and wants a simpler and more honest life.  Miss Pettigrew, an out of work governess who's had to sleep in the train station, isn't all too impressed by some of the things she sees in her foray into the rich and trendy entertainment world, and is at heart a decent, old-fashioned woman.  Their scenes together in the film feel like moments of quiet discovery.  They brush by each other throughout the course of the long day in which the movie takes place...  they talk here and there, dance, and I found all of that more engaging than the romantic hijinks of Delysia Lafosse (Amy Adams), the dizzy, ditzy actress and cabaret singer who becomes Miss Pettigrew's employer for a day.  Hinds makes for a lovely gentleman and McDormand is very sweet as Miss Pettigrew, so really  I wish there would've been more of those two.    In general the movie had a hard time finding the right pace.  At times it seemed very rushed, at other times the scenes felt like they were dragging, largely because the comic timing was off and the screenplay wasn't as witty and sharp as I felt it could've been.  Absent was the energy needed to carry the movie from scene to scene.  Amy Adams tries her best to act out her character's wild affairs, but I often felt her bubbliness was overdone.  She also didn't have a great deal of chemistry with any of the actors playing her boyfriends, especially the one who's supposed to be her true love.  Rather than characters playing off of each other, there are often slight awkward pauses, and new events and circumstances are introduced in ways that seem belabored rather than truly surprising.    Some of the supporting characters were a bit weak too.  I felt the character of Joe'sfiance, Edythe (Shirley Henderson), was rather a wasted one.  Edythe's relationship with Joe is, from the start, an empty one, and Edythe doesn't pose any real threat to Miss Pettigrew; she also isn't a sympathetic character at all, so Joe doesn't really have the dilemma of whether or not to give her up.  The whole bit with Edythe felt manufactured, which is a shame, because from her opening lines - introducing Joe's line of lingerie in an unflattering way - I thought she had some potential as an entertaining and devilish sort of woman.    Still, I think the movie might be worth seeing for McDormand, and particularly for her scenes with Hinds.  Also, there's some really good music on the soundtrack and the costumes are nice.  But on the whole it does fall short of its potential.
0385339682|3.0|The last Juror is the second book i've read from John Grisham. It takes place in a small town in Mississippi where a big crime is committed and shakes the entire county. Its is set in the 1970s when segregation was still happening.  Grisham did a good job incorporating the issue of segregation in the plot. A white man committed a rape and suicide and was sentenced to life in prison but after nine years, was released.  Then certain jurors from that trial began getting murdered.  Throughout this entire ordeal, Willie, the county's only newspaper editor, covered the trial.    What I was confused about was the title.  Personally, i don't think it fits with the story.  I didn't see the ending coming when Willie, the main character, found out who had been killing the jurors.  Overall, i think it's a good novel and i would recommend it to people interested in books that deal with the law.
B000MRAAJW|4.0|The series looks absolutely stunning in HD, but I can't give it a 5 star review due to missing material.    Each episode on the DVD is 10 minutes longer than the HD version, adding up to 110 minutes of missing material. It's lovely that the Blu-Ray and HD-DVD versions look so much better, but there's no excuse for them to be missing segments that appear on the standard DVD.    The standard DVD package also includes a 5th disc which is missing from the Blu-Ray and HD-DVD versions. This disc contains 3 one hour episodes entitled \\"Planet Earth - The Future\\", that's another hour and a half of missing material.    So in the end, HD customers are billed more for the series and presented with around 4 hours less material.
0743486285|5.0|I just got this book in the mail today.  As soon as I saw the box, i ripped through it and pulled out The Heroin Diaries.  I'm already hooked.  When I read The Dirt I was 15 and I couldn't put it down.  I'm not big on reading, in fact I don't like it much at all.  But there's something about the way it's written.  It's real, it's raw, and it's relatable (at least it was for me).  For anyone wondering what it's like to be an out-of-control addict, this is THE book.  The pages flow with euphoria, paranoia, and psychosis.  It grasps the desperate, helpless, hopeless feeling of hitting rock bottom, surviving the fall, and finding the will to get up again.
0800141601|5.0|We watched this movie with two teens and three young adults -- we all LOVED it. \\"First Knight\\" now ranks as one of our favorite movies of all time. Sean Connery is perfect in his role as King Arthur. And we were happily surprised with the versatile, athletic performance Richard Gere pulls off in this film as Lancelot -- a far cry from several of his later movies where he typically portrays a \\"stiff\\" businessman figure. There was ZERO cussing in this movie -- that in itself was refreshing! And enough action and daring to keep the four men in our group satisfied...     Guinevere, as Princess of her tiny province, is unable to defend her people from the marauding Malagant whose ultimate goal is to usurp Arthur from Camelot. Out of love and duty to her people, Guinevere accepts an offer of marriage from King Arthur -- who had been a great friend of her father's. While this is a marriage of joy for Arthur, it is a marriage of expedience on Guinevere's part -- not one of the heart. While she is sincerely attracted to Arthur's character strengths and political beliefs, he is old enough to be her father. Before Guinevere reaches her wedding day, she is kidnapped and single-handedly rescued twice by the daring young Lancelot -- who succeeds because he cares for no one, not even himself. But his bitterness with life is about to change. As his heart burns for Guinevere, Lancelot's growing respect for King Arthur brings him to the honorable decision of leaving Camelot...  The magnificence of King Arthur's lifelong concern for the welfare of others over himself comes through in a grand finale of forgiveness and blessing.
B000I2J6K0|3.0|As a regular exerciser who used weights and did regular cardio before pregnancy I was looking for a prenatal video that would feel like a pretty good workout. I bought this based on the reviews that suggested it was challenging, but still find it pretty mild, at least for now (during my second trimester). I was much more pleased with Perfect Pregnancy Workout (which has modifications for the advanced exerciser), as well as with Jennifer Wolfe's prenatal vinyasa yoga (short forms).
B000063DFQ|5.0|After firing Paul Di'Anno for his abusive drug habbits that would affect his vocals,Iron Maiden recruited Bruce Dickinson,recorded and released the masterpiece that was \\"The Number Of The Beast\\".With a new signer and a great album,Bruce reinvented Maiden(or at least changed the band a lot)and they grew more famous by the day as Bruce Dickinson proved to be a better vocalist than Paul Di'Anno and a great frontman as well.For 1983's \\"Piece Of Mind\\",Iron Maiden had gotten togheter what is considered the band's classic and best lineup,with newbie drummer Nicko McBrain.This album is arguably the best Iron Maiden album,either this or TNOTB.I would say Number Of The Beast is probably more classic than this one but Piece Of Mind is simply better in terms of sound,lyrics and proves to be much more complete overral.<br /><br />This album generated quite a few classics and some of the best songs of Iron Maiden.\\"The Trooper\\" is certainly a metal classic,its the most famous song of this album and one of Maiden's most recognized songs,I heard this song a lot already but its still an amazing song,that sounds very complex.\\"Flight Of Icarus\\" is my favourite here,it was the single of this album and has a catchy chorus that just begs for you to sing along.\\"Where Eagles Dare\\" has a great drum intro from Nicko McBrain and at over 6 minutes long proves to be quite an epic,the playing mostly is great as Bruce altought good doesn't sing a lot on that song.\\"Revelations\\" is one of the band's only ballads,its the closest to a ballad and its pretty good with the tempo changes and Bruce's vocal transitions adds to this incredible song,Bruce seems to describe a beautiful moment and in fact this might be the best track of the album.\\"Die With Your Boots On\\" is probably underrated,i don't know why as its such a great song about a captain dying with his ship and its a killer.\\"Quest For Fire\\" is not a song i liked a lot but i don't hate it,its an okay one.\\"Sun And Steel\\" is really good despite overshadowed by many other songs on the album,the chorus is ceratinly catchy and pretty solid overral.\\"Still Life\\" is the filler track to me here,its just what i think each other songs are better than this one.\\"To Tame A Land\\" is an epic,being quite long and good.<br /><br />The lineup for this album consisting of Steve Harris on Bass,Bruce Dickinson on vocals,Nicko McBrain at the drums,Dave Murray(guitar) and Adrian Smith(guitar) generated four classic albums,wich are \\"Piece Of Mind\\"(1983),\\"Powerslave\\"(1984),\\"Somewhere In Time\\"(1986)and last but not least \\"Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\\"(1988).Those are the best of Maiden and are terrfic albums for a newbie to the band.The production on this one is very good,it sounds impecabble no lousy parts at all,its perfection,HEAVY METAL perfection!Anotherb good point is that this classic sounds as good as it did over 25 years ago and to say that is quite a compliment.This remaster,tought is not as good as it should have been i mean there is only a video as an extra i think there shoud have been some unreleased tracks or something to make this worth it as unless you have it either on Vinyl or Tape,then its worth upgrading.<br /><br />Someone who never listened to Iron Maiden before could say,its just another band with typical songs,but it isn't.The songwritting is often inspired by some novels and in fact the band in the acknowledgements section of the booklet,thanks Alistair MacLean and Frank Herbert for the inspiration their novels gave to them.Piece Of Mind already became an instant classic and its still a classic today.If you are a fan of metal then this album is highly recommended to you.Starting listening Iron Maiedn with this album is a good way to get into the band as this is definatly a masterpiece.What's left to say?Piece Of Mind is one of my favourite albums ever and it gets older like a fine wine,it only gets betterby many other songs on the album,the chorus is ceratinly catchy and pretty solid overral.\\"Still Life\\" is the filler track to me here,its just what i think each other songs are better than this one.\\"To Tame A Land\\" is an epic,being quite long and good.

B0012GVKVY|5.0|Wow, i dont even know how to express how detailed this blu-ray disc is.  I own about 30 blu-rays right now and this is one of the top picture quality.    The audio is amazing, the 5.1 DTS track is very very well done.  Great quality pared with a great sci-fi movie.
0316010669|5.0|With roughly 260 pages and seven chapters (including the conclusion), \\"Blink\\" is a well-written and insightful book on the subject of accurate \\"snap judgment\\" or two-second of \\"looking.\\" This book gives us, the reader, a great deal of information about our \\"moment\\" to see things accurately, either in quick reaction, warnings, reading strangers, as it is very much like \\"gut\\" feelings or first impressions.<br /><br />I personally found this book to be quite fascinating and insightful to which I enjoyed both Gladwell's flowing writing style and his clear organization. It took me a good few hours to read it as I could not put the book down. To understand our \\"snap\\" judgment is to reach an understanding of how basic a human being really is.  Today's world, with all the media and overwhelming information, we tend to lose this kind of sense in ourselves.<br /><br />I would very much recommend this book.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|Beginning with the opening credits, 'Stargate - The Ark of Truth' shows that writer/producer/director Robert Cooper wants this movie to be more than just an extended version of the SG-1 television show. Does he succeed in turning the SG-1 world into a full length movie? To a large degree, yes, and he does it while remaining true to the spirit and flavor of the TV series.     'Coop' (familiar to many SG-1 viewers as a writer since first season) uses much of his expanded budget to bring a cinematic quality to the movie.  Some gorgeous panoramic mountain scenes back the opening credits, and later in the film he drops a major character on the same mountain tops to be shot via helicopter, reminiscent of some of the photography in Jackson's Lord of the Rings. Unlike the later episodes of the TV series which were shot in HD video, the Ark of Truth was shot on 35 mm film like a feature film, and it shows in the richness of the cinematography (by Peter Woeste, Director of Photography on the TV series). The special effects in the SG-1 series have almost always been high quality, but in the movie the extra budget shows up in the extended CGI work. Composer Joel Goldsmith (also with the show since the first season) is allowed to work with a full orchestra, and his music is a great support to the onscreen action and moods. As the opening credits roll, you may notice a difference in the SG-1 theme song reminiscent of the original Stargate feature film - a very effective way to bring a larger and slightly different feel to the Ark of Truth, and a good example of the handling of the transition from TV to movie.     The premise is fairly simple - tie up the Ori story arc that was left hanging in season 10. The basic plot is predictable since we are shown the potential solution to the Ori problem in an opening scene flashback to the million year old civilization of the Alterans, but the fun is in getting there. The various twists that occur manage to split the team up and put the members of SG-1 into the usual tight spots, something viewers of the series are familiar with. This kind of development is true to the flavor of the series since its first season. Some will be disappointed at the return of an old nemesis, but others will appreciate it as a nostalgic complication to an already hopeless situation.     The actors brought their well-established characters to this movie, and there's not a bad performance in the bunch. Their enjoyment of working with each other, and their off-screen friendships, are very evident as on-screen chemistry. Samantha Carter (played by Amanda Tapping) was a bit underutilized, but her character performs the usual miracles under pressure. Cam Mitchell (Ben Browder) amusingly accepts command of the Odyssey for the voyage to the Ori galaxy, and manages to quip humorously even as he gets the life beat out of him. Vala Maldoran (Claudia Black) is her usual sarcastic, slightly devious, yet vulnerable and funny self. Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson) gives a very strong emotional performance in one scene, demonstrating the personal toll that the whole ancient/ascension experience has taken on him over the years. And Teal'c (Christopher Judge) addresses the issue of how he has dealt with (or not dealt with) his past, where he was responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent people. It provides the motivation for the act he performs later in the movie, which is one of Tealc's great moments in the SG-1 mythology.     Viewers of the series will recognize other regulars and guests, including Beau Bridges (General Landry), Gary Jones (Chief Master Sergeant Walter Harriman), Morena Baccarin (Vala's daughter Adria), Eric Brecker (Colonel Reynolds), Martin Christopher (Major Marks), Doug Abrahams (Prior #2), and Julian Sands as the Doci. There are two special guest appearances of note. Tim Guinee reprises his recurring series role as Tomin, husband of Vala in the Ori galaxy. He gives an excellent performance beginning where the series left off, as a true believer in Origin, but a doubting agent of the priors, and he grows throughout the movie to become an ally with a special bond to Teal'c. Currie Graham plays Merrick, a very unlikable ex-CIA operative turned agent of the bureaucratic I.O.A., who is responsible for some major peril SG-1 faces. I won't spoil it for you, but his character is dealt with in a very satisfying manner. ;-)     The DVD includes a commentary track with Robert Cooper, Peter Woeste, and Christopher Judge that is reasonably informative and entertaining. Special features include a filmed panel discussion at a recent Comic-Con that will have you laughing out loud, and a good 'making-of' documentary. There is also a 'Prelude to the Ark of Truth', which recaps the entire Ori story arc from the series; very helpful if you have not watched the shows in a while. The packaging is good with a sturdy plastic case in a cardboard sleeve.     I found little to complain about with this DVD, but it is not perfect. As attractive as the cinematography is, I think Cooper probably spent a little too much time and money trying to bring a cinematic feel to the movie when the extra screen time would have been better spent dealing with the story and characters.  There are the usual 'homages' to other movies which can come across as unoriginal, but the series has always been full of these, and the writers/directors have always taken great pleasure in emulating shots from their favorite movies. (Look for nods to \\"Star Wars\\", \\"The Terminator\\" and \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" in this one.) There is a scene where the use of a slanted view from a shaky handheld camera is distracting and seems inappropriate to the moment, but most of the camera work is superb and matches the mood.     Perhaps the biggest problem is that the movie tries to fit so much into a limited time that it feels rushed. I found myself wishing for more details on the Alteran civilization, more of the usual SG-1 exploration, andmore character moments.  As it is, the story could easily have taken 3 episodes of the TV series, and with expanded details and more character beats, even more. But it is better for a movie to make you want more, than making you want it to end earlier.     Bottom line, this is well-produced fun entertainment, with characters you can care about, with enough action to keep it moving, while remaining true to the spirit of the SG-1 world. And most importantly, I found it to be a satisfying (if rushed) ending to the Ori story arc.  If you have not seen the series, you will definitely be confused, even after watching the 'Prelude' first. If you are someone that feels the series went south after Richard Dean Anderson left, then you won't like this movie because it deals with the SG-1 of the last two seasons.  In that case you might want to check out the latest SG-1 movie 'Continuum' where Don Davis and R.D.A. make brief appearances.    5 stars for cinematography and acting, 4 starts for story line, 3 stars for originality and pace.  Give it a 4 overall.  All in all, this is a good ending to the series, and a good beginning for more direct-to-disk releases.  I hope the DVD does well enough that more will be made in the future.
B000AMWIVM|2.0|I saw this in distribution. I actually had to turn my head at certain points. This, along with Trent Reznor's soundtrack made for a great splatter flick. I thought the uncut version could only be better.....WRONG. It is not nearly as tense and nerve-racking as the theater version. Plus, they have replaced Reznor's soundtrack with something else. In this case, the orginal was much better. Be warned!
B0000268M6|5.0|Ludovico Einaudi is, in my opinion, the best composer working today in the nebulous field of \\"neo-classical\\" or \\"new age\\" or \\"contemporary piano,\\" whatever you want to call it.  His music has a minimalist flair, reminiscent of Philip Glass (but more melodic than Glass) or Yann Tiersen.  Out of deference to the cranky reviewer below, I won't compare Einaudi to John Reich, except to say that Einaudi's pieces have much greater melodic appeal to me than Reich's. ;-)<br /><br />Le Onde is a very good album, but not Einaudi's best.  The strongest tracks are \\"Le Onde,\\" \\"Questa Notte\\" and \\"Ombre.\\"  If you are new to Einaudi, I'd recommend that you start with the \\"Echoes\\" greatest hits collection instead, or \\"Divenire,\\" his most recent release.  If you are an established Einaudi fan, then you will probably want \\"Le Onde\\" simply to have a complete collection.<br /><br />One last comment: Einaudi has released most of the sheet music for his work, and it ranges in difficulty from fairly easy to quite advanced.  I recommend highly \\"The best of Ludovico Einaudi: Piano solo\\" sheet music collection.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|This is a classic that no one can afford to miss out on.  It's for all generations as long as the viewer is old enough for an \\"R\\" film.    See Belushi at his best.  The film has well known actors and those who play good support roles.    It's a superb film for Tim Matheson.  He's got a great role as do others who fit in excellently with the dialogue and scenes.  You'll be rolling on your couch, even if you've got a son considering joining a frat.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|While the events in this movie are based on actual events, the movie does not pretend to be historically accurate in all things.  The movie is as much about the legend of El Cid as it is about the real El Cid.    This is one of the epic movies that Hollywood is famous for making many years ago.  It is long, but it is still 40 minutes shorter than Ben Hur.  Because of its length, the movie itself is on two DVDs.  The last chapter on the first DVD is actually the intermission.  I fast-forwarded through the intermission to get back to the movie only to find out that I had to put the other DVD in.  It would have been good to either delete the intermission or to give some warning that there is no movie after the intermission.    The casting in this movie is great.  Sophia Loren is a pefect contrast to Charlton Heston.  She brings a lot of passion to her role which is what was needed of her.  Charlton Heston does a great job in a role that he was born to do.      The only actor that threw me was Herbert Lom as the leader of the invading Muslim army.  He only has about 5 minutes in the movie, but I had trouble seeing him as a dangerous fundamentalist.  All I could think of when I saw him was his role as Chief Inspector Dreyfus in the Pink Panther Movies.  I realize that El Cid came out before these movies, but the association is very strong in my mind.    The visual quality of the movies is great in this new format.  I saw this years ago on VHS and the inprovement is amazing.  The audio is less than perfect.  The music is louder than the dialog in a lot of parts.      I give this DVD set 5 stars even while acknowledging some negatives because this is such a great movie.  It is a great movie to have in your collection.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|If you like chick flicks and traveling I recommend that you see this movie.It's simply an excellent film if that's what your into.
B000002ORU|5.0|i already had a respectable WHO collection but this is like icing on the cake..
B000UFAURI|4.0|Foo Fighters decided to cement their ten-year history with [[ASIN:B0009HLDFU In Your Honor]] back in 2005, and although that album was good, it was still the first album from them that I gave less than a four-star rating to (I gave it a three-and-a-half). Now they're back with Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace.<br /><br />This album illustrates another case where although I like the first single (which also becomes a hit), what I like more is the second single that DOESN'T become a hit -- in other words, my favorite song on the album is \\"Long Road to Ruin\\". But \\"The Pretender\\" is still damn good, as are \\"Let It Die\\" and \\"Come Alive\\". This album is also pretty divided, as the more energetic tracks are on the first half of the album (with the exception of \\"Once & for All\\", which I think is only on the digital version) while the mellow songs are on the second half. Fortunately, while the songs on the second (acoustic) disc of In Your Honor were so similar that it sounded like an hour of the same song, the production in THIS case is more varied, as \\"Summer's End\\", \\"Home\\" (the song that inspired the album's title) and \\"Statues\\" easily stand out.<br /><br />Maybe Foo Fighters should work with Gil Norton more often because although they have never made a bad album, Gil was also present on their best album [[ASIN:B000QEIORG The Colour & the Shape]], and this album is right up there with that one. Pick it up if you haven't already.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B0002WZTOI|4.0|A good movie....however, remember that movies from the 80's and 90s that are rated PG are not as innocent as you might think.  I got this for my husband and ten and a half year old son who wants to be a fighter pilot.  I was disappointed that I forgot what bad language it contains.  However, we got through it, and were very pleased with the bonus feature disc that comes with it.  It was cool to watch all the stuff about how it was made, etc.
0553213105|5.0|I decided on my own to read this book when I was just 12 years old. I immediately fell in love with the language, era, and setting, not to mention the characters and story. My all-time favorite book, I have read it several more times, and probably own every movie and mini-series version as well. Although ours is no longer a culture of manners, life events and human emotions never change. Superb reading!
B0000X61VE|5.0|I purchased the VHS version of this workout video when it first came out around 15 years ago and used it then to take off 30+ pounds and continued to use it throughout the years when I needed to get back into shape.  After having a child two years ago and one three months ago, I needed to lose lots of weight again and found that I had finally worn out my VHS version and bought this DVD on Amazon.  I have currently lost 31 pounds and will continue to lose more with this DVD's help in the next few months.  Would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants a full body strengthening workout!
0618918248|1.0|Dawkins can speak as a scientist. He has the right to do so.  But to give special compensation to his words on that basis is wrong.  Dawkins assumes a patronizing voice of one so intelligent that with sincere sympathy wonder at the simple naïve thoughts of mental peasants.  “The story makes me almost tearful, and it brings me as close as I shall probably come to understanding the consoling and counseling role of imaginary gods in people’s lives.”<br /><br />Dawkins claims that the existence of God can be settled scientifically, but then uses ridicule to make his case.  Many reviewers have ridiculed Dawkins for using ridicule. When not guffawing, Dawkins attempts to use verbal logic from which we are to draw conclusions.  We have very little else to work with, but we need to remember that no formal logic exists that can remove the semantic ambiguities.  Philosophers  have been debating the correct forms of logic with respect to religious questions for centuries, ironically using verbal logic.<br /><br />Having said that, Dawkins invokes infinite regression to ask who would have designed the designer, but can't answer what came before the big bang.  No one can.  Currently, physicists are avoiding the question by claiming that our concept of time does not apply before the Big Bang.  It appears that man cannot know the &#34;mind&#34; of God.<br /><br />Dawkins conveniently forgets that science is a process, a discipline.  To enumerate the equations and rules has its place and can be powerful.  But when scientists attempt to draw philosophical conclusions from the equations they are no different than the shaman who sees the meaning of life in a disarray of human bones.  The equations are just as much an invention of a rational mind as is a belief in God.  Dawkins believes in the equations, not God. I might come to the same conclusion, but there is no reproducible physical experiment I can perform to verify Dawkins' personal opinions.<br /><br />I challenge Dawkins to prove that quarks exist.  I doubt that he has personally witnessed the experiments or has a direct grasp of the physics and mathematics that supports their existence.  So then, Dawkins must be passing this on to us as one scientific authority faithfully quoting another.  I personally have no direct experience or comprehension of quarks.  I have to take it for granted.  I have to have faith in the validity of science because a very few people with far more insight than I possess say so.  I realize how disingenuous this is of me because I know that if I study hard enough I can examine the evidence and possibly come to the same conclusions.  Religion, on the other hand, is not based upon reproducible evidence, the cornerstone of science.<br /><br />I believe in Quarks because I accept the principles of the scientific method and have faith that scientific authority can be trusted to not violate those principles.<br /><br />I believe in God because I accept the principles of religion and have faith that religious authority can be trusted to not violate those principles.<br /><br />Let’s try a little thought experiment.  The first statement is easier to embrace because we live in a modern rational age.  The second is more difficult because, frankly, religion does not have a good track record.  Were religion to practice what it preaches, would Dawkins have an evolved leg to stand on?  Upon subtraction, we have an attack on religion because he doesn't like Christian ideas.  Therefore, the stance against religion is based upon the atrocious acts, not against the ideas.  If this is not true, then Dawkins is guilty of waging war against thought crime.  Perhaps both are true.  Dawkins has not proved that religious atrocities directly result from religious faith.  Would there be fewer horrific events if religion never existed?  How can we possibly know this?  How can Dawkins know this?  We need to pay better attention.<br /><br />Having said all this, I need to state thatnone of it should be taken to mean that I disagree with Dawkins' belief that there is no God.  I merely disagree in the way he gets there.  At the end of the day, I merely don't see the point.  It adds nothing to my understanding of the universe.  And I do not feel the need to commit atrocities because my morality is not grounded in religious myth.  I said this elsewhere; I might as well say it again:  The theists are absolutely right about everything!  Let's give them that. Now go find God and ask him why man is evolved from apes instead of angels.t should be taken to mean that I disagree with Dawkins' belief that there is no God.

B00005JLFC|5.0|This is an amazing work by Barbra Streisand.  It has made a profound imprint on me in a variety of ways.  The role of women and what they had to do in order to become what they were meant to achieve and the lyrics of the songs and how it relates to me personally and to other women.  Also, how the theme of the play is so Barbra in her responsibilities to this movie.  I recommend the soundtrack, the musical, the story behind the story, Barbra's desires to make this musical, the connection to the original play, the differences between Barbra's version and the original play.  Bravo Barbra!
0812550706|5.0|I've found myself on more occasions that I can remember, using Ender's Game as an example for a variety of things.  \\"It's like in that book Ender's Game, when...\\"  I think I quote it more than the Bible, or at least more than the Koran.  Great story, great moral, makes you laugh, makes you cry - but most importantly makes you imagine.
B00009L1TA|4.0|This is one of those movies that you criticise whenever you're thinking logically...even though you secretly love it when you've got a night alone and feel like watching a movie.    The acting is...passable.  The writing is on the same level.  The plot is downright silly, but enjoyable at the same time.  Enough money went into this picture to leave nothing missing from sound, special effects, or set pieces.  The holes in the plot are huge, but the producers seem to have gone with the \\"if you can't hide it, feature it\\" school of thought.  It's left as an open-ended, figure-it-out-yourself closing at the end (don't try TOO hard).    Look, I'm not going to argue that this movie will be remembered in 50 years.  All I can say is I've watched it about 10 times, with everyone from army buddies to a range of girlfriends, to family, all the way to friends from school and training...and it's always a great movie for a rainy night in.    Worth the price.  Fun.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|another great season. My only complaint is how it ended. it was just over. It was like the writers just ran out of steam and left us hanging. The development of the characters in this season has been a great.
0783235380|3.0|Just didn't get the point of this movie. IT has sorry a ending. The story of an engaged man getting trapped with a woman that is a bit on the loony side. **spoiler** They end up getting together after trying very hard not to. They decide that they are meant to be together but only in the end separate!!
B000089QEN|3.0|The acting was mediocre. The story just wasn't what I wanted it to be. There is a bit of nudity which was unnecessary. I don't know which movie is closer to the book but if I had to pick one I would choose the newest one with Reese Witherspoon. It just had a better and more dramatic ending. The production was a decent one and that is the best I can give it.
0679745653|5.0|Arguably the greatest writer of the 20th century, the only misfortune of Capote's work is that there is not more of it.  In this somewhat peculiar collection of stories, Capote demonstrates his command of the written word.  While one tale gives the book its title, another story shines even brighter in this collection.<br /><br />\\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\"  is a legendary work in the cinema, though fewer Americans every year realize it is based on a novel.  While certainly more crude at times, the written version adds another intended dimension to the tale.  In reality, Audrey Hepburn's potrayal was far too sanitized.  \\"House of Flowers\\" is an odd story of a wife that never had the approval of her mother-in-law.  \\"A Diamond Guitar\\" is a tale of prison friendship in which one character almost seems to be the adolescent male version of Holly Golightly.<br /><br />\\"A Christmas Memory\\" is a story that some may find too sweet for their taste much like a Christmas fruitcake.  But even better than the other tales in the collection, it symbolizes a friendship that ends far too premature for the characters.  The youthful recollection is engaging enough to make readers recall elders, that have left this world before them, in yearning gaze.<br /><br />Though this collection is tied together with a loose theme, it is a sample of Capote's command over language.  With vivid details and command of plot, the knowledgeable reader will not be disappointed in Capote.
0143038419|5.0|As a sarcastic, cranky New Yorker I did everything in my power to avoid reading this book.  I was all Judge-y Wudge-y like the rest of NYC.  But there's nothing like a little heartbreak (read DEVASTATING BREAK-UP) to open your mind a bit.      Elizabeth gives the appropriate weight and humor to the experience of heartache and how if handled properly can open your world to a new set of possibilities.  For anyone who has lived the dream of a break-up, you know that what you crave most of all is a flipping break from your own mind's vicious attack.  You just need some altitude to see where you are really at right now so that you can move forward.  Elizabeth's crazy journey takes that concept to the ultimate place.  Inspiring and funny and real.      I am officially one of those Eat Pray Love women now..whatever, I feel a lot better.
B0011UF79C|4.0|I have two topics to mention: The \\"special features\\" and the \\"image quality\\".    It is worth noting that I own the both the original Gattaca DVD and Super-Bit version for comparison.    1) Special Features:  While maintaining the original DVD's ugly menu system, this edition contains a 22 featurette on the making of Gattaca with interviews of Ethan Hawke, Jude Law, and a number of the production crew.  I enjoyed this addition.  There is also a new clip on gene manipulation (history, current, and future) which was somewhat interesting.    2) Image Quality:  The original DVD was only a single layer 4.5gb disk, which resulted in a grainy image with a slightly blue tint.  The Super-Bit disk was disappointingly mastered, with visible dust and hair in the copy.  The Super-Bit version took on a more natural tone but suffered from over-saturated browns and greens.    Finally, this reproduction seems to have a good balance between color and image quality, although some scenes are a little grainy and the movie overall seems darker.      Conclusion:  Is it worth buying this edition if you have one of the others?  Probably not, but with the HD format wars over, I might be inclined to splurge on a Blu-Ray player to give the new Blu-Ray Gattaca disk a spin.
0452289963|1.0|Tolle's books are a collection of vague clichés and ambiguous platitudes;  a combination of kindergarten philosophy and New Age mysticism.  There are millions of books available, written by so-called enlightened individuals who all churn out the same stuff.  Does this prove there must be something to them?  Not at all.  Billions of fast food joints doesn't prove that fast food has much nutritional value for the body.  Similarly, thousands of self-described enlightened writers putting out books like these doesn't prove that fast-food spirituality has much nutritional value for the spirit.  Eckhart Tolle admits that his enlightenment came spontaneously.  Clearly he didn't need a book like his to become enlightened.  Why should anyone else?  I'm just going to wait until I become spontaneously enlightened too.
B00005JPOO|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, as I entered it with zero expectation for enjoyment. As a guy, I am not inclined to fantasy/romances.<br /><br />However, this movie was well cast, making the characters very enjoyable.(Especially Penelope's mom, played brilliantly by Catherine O'Hara.) And despite the pig snout, cute Christina Ricci alone made it worth the money. James McAvoy also turned in a nice performance. (Special note to the scene when he sings \\"You Are My Sunshine.\\") And Reese Witherspoon was awesome!<br /><br />Sure it got cheesy at times, but what else can we expect from a PG love movie? I definately recommend seeing this film. It'll be worth your time and money.
B0010YSD7M|3.0|* Spoilers  Being a very big fan of the series, I must say that this was somewhat of a disappointment.  There was enough in this 102 minute movie to expand into at least one season.  Another annoying thing about the movie is that the Replicators, which I consider to be the best enemy in all of Stargate Sg-1, was introduced and are defeated in the same movie?  If they wanted to bring the Replicators back, they should have had a seperate movie for the Replicators.  The Replicators also made it so that the only people actually helping at all at finding the Ark of Truth are Daniel, Vala, and Tealc.  Sam and Cam are busy fighting the Replicators and don't contribute that much to the Ori ending.  It was good, but I had seen several season finales that were much better than this movie.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|If you rent this movie for the car chases, you will be very disappointed...there are none.<br /><br />Besides that point, there were several things I didn't like. For one, the special effects were terrible. The CG teacups looked COMPLETELY fake. Also, I couldn't understand a word that was said, as it was all spoken very quickly, in whispers and in heavy accents. The dance numbers were terribly choreographed, and frankly unimpressive. They looked nothing like the dancing in \\"Step Up\\"<br /><br />The only thing I liked was Darcy. The actor who played him was marvelous, conveying all the emotions you could think of in both his voice, and his expression.<br /><br />Another bad thing is the plot. It didn't even make sense. It's no wonder the author who wrote the book isn't well known or anything...
B0010YSD7M|4.0|First a note to fans of the 1994 MOVIE:<br />If you are not familiar with Stargate SG-1 the television show, this is not the movie for you.  In case you are unsure of what this product is, it's a continuation of the Television series of the same name.  If you've only seen the movie, you'll want to start with the first season DVD of SG1.<br /><br />Now on to the review:<br />Overall I think this was a very enjoyable film.  It picks up right where the final season had ended.  It deals mostly with the ORI and serves to wrap up that story arc.  The production values were very high and when it was all said and done, I had a very good time.  That doesn't mean there weren't issues, though.  But most are pretty minor and not worth nit-picking here.<br /><br />The Plot (No Spoilers Version):<br />SG1 is looking for an Ancient artifact called the Ark of Truth (obviously) in the hopes that it will help them to defeat the Ori, a race of ascended zealots who feed off the worship of their ... well, worshipers.<br /><br />The story takes us to several familiar settings and sees the return of many popular characters from the 9th and 10th seasons of the show.  It also adds some new faces as well!  Sadly, Richard Dean Anderson does not make an appearance as Jack O'Neill.  Robert Picardo is also absent (now part of the Atlantis mission) as Woozy.  However the rest of the SG1 gang is all here.<br /><br />Fans of the Star Gate SG1 series will definitely want to add this film to their collection.  You'll easily be able to overlook it's shortcomings and enjoy it for what it is ... a film about our favorite characters from a great series and a wrap up to 10 great years of television.  I look forward to seeing what they have coming next with their release of Continuum this summer!
B000WGZGNS|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this DVD. Before I bought this dvd I was not a huge fan of Beyonce's music although I found her visually very appealing & thought she was a good dancer. But this concert was amazing, Beyonce sounded beautiful: doing several acapella sections to demonstrate her control over her fabulous voice. This DVD proved one thing to me: Beyonce can really sing!<br /><br />I loved the parts where she was just singing.<br /><br />I also loved the dancing, OMG, the dancing was incredible and as usual all of the outfits in this show were all show-stoppers. Beyonce looked smoking hot and elegant at the same time: how does she dance in those heels?<br /><br />I loved the moments where she let the members of her band play their instruments solo it shows how much individual talents she has in her band. She also did a reggae segment that I loved.<br /><br />All of Beyonce's team was on point for this one, The back up singers were fabulous, the dancers were great and the all female band was rocking!<br /><br />This DVD also has special appearances by Jay Z and Destiny's Child.<br /><br />While watching this concert I was reminded of just how many hits Beyonce has been a part of over the past few years. She performed all her major hits from Destiny's child, Dangeroulsly in Love and B'day including music from the Dreamgirls soundtrack and \\"Check On It\\" from The Pink Panther movie.<br /><br />Also it must be said that the stage & the lights were AMAZING.<br /><br />I loved this DVD, 10 stars!
B000R7HY0K|2.0|Both 'Resevoir Dogs', and 'Pulp fiction' are phenomenal films by Quentin Tarantino. I wont deny him that. And whilst the Kill Bills played a very large homage to films of the past (including a scene that came straight out of Good Bad and the Ugly) I was willing to accept his ambitions as a movie buff.     But the Grindhouse films are simply a blatant attempt to cash in on the history of cinema. Its a movie buff trying to see the job through (starting with Kill Bill). Its more blatant and to be quite honest I find it insulting. Wouldnt we all love to make a movie that ripped off some of our favourite films from back in the day. HE Throws in a few Quentin trademarks, blood splatters, drawn out coffee conversations, and overly cool lines... and you have yourself the Grindhouse.     Deathproof is Quentin's overly stylized film with very little substance. I am a fan of the very films he tries to emulate and even though he tries ever so hard to make these feel and sound like the 70's cult classics... it lacks any flair. He tries too hard.. the grazing of the film quality and the intermittent reel skips are just too forced. Its like going to Disney Land... nothing is real... and everything is... \\"how can we make this cool\\"    Tarantino is all about how can we make this cool... oh I know... let the girls kick some a$$... oh I know ... I'll make her walk around with one leg... oh I know... Ill make myself a bad a$$.     The endings to both Grindhouse movies are terribly over the top and I know we can sit here and argue that it was intentional in the tradition of 70's cult classics... but it doesnt work... and thats the bottom line.    So is this Tarantino's future, to indulge as a movie buff.. to borrow, steal and pluck from the tree... is this ok?.. as long as he admits to it?     Does he think he is doing us a favour. As if to say that we had not seen such classics or that we needed the cult explained to us once more?    Of course he has a fan base now that will call whatever he does \\"genius\\".  This is not Genius... the originals are... this is a movie that copies from other movies. Plain and simple folks.     (Yeh Im annoyed... dont ever steal from 'the Good bad and the ugly' ever again Quentin - these are our classic cult films too).
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I just received the DVD today.  I have been a huge fan of Stargate since the original movie.  I was very dissapointed when SciFi channel cut SG1, especially since they replaced it whith ECW.  Of course, now I do not watch SciFi channel that much. Just to see Stargate Atlantis and a couple other shows.    The movie The Ark of Truth should be a huge success.  It is well acted and the music score is outstanding. I was on the edge of my seat for nearly the whole movie as things went from bad to worse for SG1.  Before seeing that there is another movie pending, I was concerned that SG1 was going to get killed off in a way similar to what was done to Farscape. Fortunately this did not happen, though I thought one of the SG1 Team would be killed off at a couple points during the movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes SciFi and especially to any Stargate SG1 fan.
009917961X|5.0|This isn't a mystery, nor is it a thriller.  There are no sadistic serial killers slinking through the night, no wondering who the killer is, no car chases, etc.  Despite that, this is a suspenseful book that had me cheering for the little guy to prevail.    A newly minted lawyer in Memphis takes on a mega insurance company, represented by a pack of lawyers who have initials in front of their names and Roman numberals behind.  And lest I forget, expensive clothes and haughty smirks.  The issue:  the insurance company arbitrarialy turned down coverage for a bone marrow transplant that would have saved the life of a young man with cancer.  Every trick is used to reject coverage, to obfuscate, to delay.  As an aside, I worked in insurance for over 26 years, and Mr. Grisham's version represents what I saw and sometimes did.  I'm not proud of it.    Apparently some other reviewers read a different book from the one I read.  One said that the characters were not well drawn.  I thought they were excellent.  Some doubted the plot.  Don't doubt it.  Grisham stacked the cards, but that's the nature of fiction.  This book along with the movie \\"Sicko\\" give an accurate picture of how insurance companies often operate.  Adjusters are not promoted for how fairly they settle claims by the terms of the policy but by how many claims they can deny or settle for a sum below what the policy promises.  \\"We're on your side\\" and \\"good hands\\" are what all companies promise, one way or another, but they are promises that are not always delivered.    I've not always been fond of Grisham's novels, but this one is a winner.  It also has some nice surprises, ones I certainly didn't expect.  That added to the pleasure in reading this.
B00111YM5G|2.0|I thought this movie would be a more action based angel vs Devil for the right to control purgatory movie but I was Grossly misinformed the movie starts out with the arch-angel Gabriel coming to earth when you think it was supposed to be the realm of Purgatory like the movie says.What I mean is you watch the intro it starts out how seven angels and seven fallen angels vie for control of the souls of purgatory who have yet to be decided if they go to heaven or hell the evil forces have apparently taken over what you think is purgatory and have started corrupting the masses there.That is why Gabriel is sent he is the last arch-angel not killed or defeated in that realm yet including Michael who is apparently missing in the realm of supposed purgatory.When an angel or fallen angel enters this world they have to take a human body that was the first thing that threw me off weren't these people supposed to be dead already also when he meets one of the other arch-angels Raphael who tells him how hard it is to live in this world as a human that really threw me off how did they get from purgatory to the human world that is supposed to be separated.Then he explains how if an angel or fallen is killed on earth that both the soul and the angel or fallen inhabiting the body would both ceases to exist.I'm sorry but how did we get from protecting the realm of purgatory to going to the living world they never tell you yes there are some gun fights and combat but both are pretty lacking don't expect the bourne movie fighting sequences or the matrix like special effects.The acting isn't bad but it dose not help this movie much I say this is a rental at best but you won't hurt yourself by missing it either a real sleeper movie sad to say
B0001IN07Q|5.0|I watch the DVD over and over.  The next best thing to actually seeing him live.  I have loved his music for years but once you watch him perform, you are hooked.  This DVD has turned casual fans in to fanatics.  Not only is he a talented singer but he will make you laugh.  Can't say enough about it.  I just went to my first live concert of his and it was more than I expected!!!! This is sooooo worth it.
B000ZN8036|5.0|Right now this movie has 88 reviews with a 4-star average, folks that is a disgrace.  This movie is the best I've seen in years and deserves nothing less than 7 or 8 stars.  This dude reminds me of Travis Bickle (Deniro) in Taxi Driver, fed up with the \\"existential angst of being\\" in a hypocritical and savagely-selfish world, except this guy doesn't go around shooting people, he retreats Into The Wild instead.  I can greatly sympathize both with this man and with Bickle's character.  Eddie Vedder, by the way, comes through with the music for this movie, in such a magical way, that I'm sure it'll catch even Pearl Jam fans off-guard.  This is better Vedder than I had ever heard before, even as a fan of the classics from a couple decades back.  I as well had all but given up hope in American cinema, as it's usually just blank-negativity or blatant propaganda both of which are grossly predictable at this point and oh so typical of the present admin and of our times.  It seems like every year or so I see a genuinely great movie though, this is one of them.  Into the Wild joins ranks with Cast Away, Million Dollar Baby, Grizzly Man, and the Motorcycle Diaries.  I can vouge for the reality which permeates this film, as I was homeless for the better part of 4 years, and have also been a regular faster from food for years now (off & on, of course).  This movie shows both worlds very clearly, to put it simply, any lover of nature and Thoreau will be very grateful that they own a copy of this DVD.  And for you my friends this is non-optional, trust me on this one, you must go out and see it at once.  I highly doubt I will ever in my lifetime forget this man's words: Happiness Only Real When Shared.  I just wish we all could live that more, then maybe we wouldn't have people retreating into the woods so much, much more than people \\"who walk a straight line from cradle to the grave\\" might assume.  Peace.
0684830485|4.0|Hemingway is a master storyteller, and FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is a fine example of that mastery. The strengths lie in character development, and thematic presentation. The weaknesses lie in it's style, and language. For example, the use of what passes for colloquial Spanish, particularly in it's profane form, seems artificial and clumsy. I also think elements of the plot tend to weaken or dilute the overall effect of the climax, like when Pilar reads Jordan's palm to tell his future, thus foreshadowing events to come.    That being said, this is a very inspirational book, and Hemingway has a knack for grabbing the reader's attention, and keeping it. He is especially good in his short fiction, and an excellent example of that can be found within this novel, when Pilar tells the tale of her village. It is perhaps,the single most riveting and effective part of the novel.    FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is of course one of the great novels to deal with sacrifice for righteous causes, and devotion to higher ideals. It reminds me, in a way, of A TALE OF TWO CITIES, in that respect. It is a great noble work, and an indictment of war. There is also a great personal love story here. Hemingway writes (maybe intentionally) very cinematic novels.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Leaving the Ori storyline unresolved at the end of Sg-1's final season, the makers of the show give us this film. The Ark Of Truth lives up the hype of fans hoping for an epic end to the storyline that drove the show's final two seasons.  Indeed, The Ark Of Truth proves to be both an epic and fitting end to the Ori storyline.<br /><br />In fact one might go so far as to assume that the show never ended. From the performances of SG-1's members, it's just like picking up where Unending left off. In particular Michael Shanks and Ben Browder both get to shine in their roles of Daniel Jackson and Cameron Mitchell. That's not to say the rest of cast doesn't, but Shanks and Browder really do stand out in this. The supporting cast does too from Beau Bridges to Sarah Strange, from Sarah Strange to the villainous Julian Sands and the absolutely evil Morena Baccarin. The real stand out of the supporting cast however is Currie Graham as Merrick, the double crossing IOA supervisor.<br /><br />The rest of the production is also first rate for the film, in both writing and production values, is epic. There is a scope to the film that wasn't possible for the show on television. The story feels epic, taking us from Earth to the Ori galaxy and back again. The story has so much going on though that we don't get to see some of the things fans would like to have seen but we see enough to keep everyone happy. The effects and photography aren't just as good as they were on the show, they're better. They go from mountains in the opening credits, the ruins of Dakarra and the Altaran city, to the Ark itself: something that was hard (if not impossible) for the series to do with even a two-part two of the series. There's also one or two moments that evoke memories of the original movie from years ago and fans should get a smile out of it. There's one other thing to mention: the music. The music by Joel Goldsmith is just as epic as the film, evoking not just the original Stargate theme by David Arnold but the Germanic chants of the Ori themes and heroic themes for the team. But the real treat of the music is that while it may be familiar, you've never heard it played this. Fans of the series won't be disappointed. Everything that made us love the series is still here and thriving.<br /><br />Not to say the film is perfect, which it isn't. Some parts of the film don't make a lot of sense such as the IOA's actions. They don't make much sense especially when they resurrect an old enemy from the series in the process. I won't spoil it because it makes for a great plot twist, but in retrospect it just feels like padding. There's also the odd flashbacks to the Altarans involving the Ark which, while they add some texture, really might not have been needed. But these are minor flaws, and its hard to find anything without any.<br /><br />The DVD has bonus features for any of the series to enjoy. From Comic-Con to a making of documentary, fans get the chance to go behind the scenes of the film and its promotion. There's also a short semi-preview of the second direct to DVD SG-1 movie to tease fans with. But the mains tar of the bonus features is the commentary by writer/director Robert C. Cooper, cinematographer Peter Woeste, and actor Christopher Judge. Their commentary talks about not just the making of the film, but the attempts to make the film larger and better then the series and the difficulties in doing so. For fans the commentary is a must-hear.<br /><br />In short, The Ark Of Truth is a good film. It does exactly what it was supposed to do: be both an epic and fitting end to the Ori storyline. It succeeds for the most part, though it does have some flaws to it. While non-fans might want to watch the Prelude on the DVD to catch-up on all the plotlines going on in the film, fans should enjoy it. If this and Continuum, the yet to be released second film, are to be the final end of Stargate SG-1, they will be the fitting end of the series.e Germanic chants of the Ori themes and heroic themes for the team.

B000YRY8BG|5.0|\\"The more compelling moments of the series come not in the various subplots surround the mystery in front of us--although it is a great mystery indeed--but in how indoctrinate and incestuous the interplay between politics, media, and industry are in the modern information age. All three stand at cross-purposes, yet secretly acknowledge that none can succeed without careful consideration of the other two. Vital communication often runs deep underneath the observed interactions between the groups, taking place in back-room meetings and clandestine e-mails, and through veiled threats.\\" Judge Arsenault<br /><br />Having just come off the viewing of 10 weeks of the critically acclaimed HBO's TV show 'The Wire', I needed a pick me up, and wowser did I find one. This BBC 6 show series that aired in 2004 has it all and it is an even toss up with me as to which show is best, 'The Wire' or 'State of Play'. In both series the acting is superb. Bill Nighy as the wry, buttoned down, full of himself editor of the Herald hits the mark every time and won the UK's Best Actor award.  Polly Walker known to most of us from HBO's 'Rome' is the politician's wife and is flawless. David Morrissey, as the politician, John Simm and Kelly Macdonald as the intrepid reporters for the Herald mark this cast as fully realized.<br /><br />The shotgun murder of a drug-related killing, and the apparent accidental death of Sonia Baker, a researcher for Member of Parliament Stephen Collins seems unrelated. The one difference is the makings of a scandal when the news of Sonia's death hits the streets. Stephen Collins the Parliament member who employed Sonia is visibly shocked and upset when her death is announced.  The editor of the Herald suspects some hanky-panky and sends two of his best investigative reporters out to look the matter over. Cal McCaffrey and Della Smith find that these two deaths are not only related but were linked to the oil industry and the British government. One scandal after another is uncovered and this minor story soon leaps to the largest story of the year.<br /><br />The story of corruption and mayhem and lies and deceit are all realistic. The fact that the media, government and industry could all be in collusion seems all too true to those of us in the US looking at the war in Iraq and what has been wrought. What we don't count on is that once we think we have everything figured out, a new twist occurs. Some of this is a little over the top, but the superb acting counters any fallacy.<br /><br />'State Of Play' shines on the media, in this case, the newspaper, the Herald. Financial success is intertwined with the government, and it is not easy to convince the CEO and the board that publishing the story is the right thing to do. Everyone in this series is touched in some manner by the final decisions and actions that take place. The action, the suspense, the writing, the cinematography are all as one to produce one of the best BBC series I have viewed.  Helen Mirren and Russell Crowe are at this moment filming a movie version of this series. We have the best here, how could they ever top this series?<br /><br />Highly, Highly Recommended. prisrob 03-13-08<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000A59PL0 The Girl in the Cafe]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000A1HQ7 8 1/2 Women]]ed and this minor story soon leaps to the largest story of the year.

B000R7HY0K|4.0|While 'Planet Terror' was fun, campy and over the top, 'Death Proof' really set a stage (perhaps a bit too much), takes itself more seriously (not necessarily a bad thing), psychological character study of a psychotic killer who stalks groups of young, unsuspecting women with a souped-up muscle car as his weapon of choice.    While some do decry the lengthy, dialog-driven charcter establishment of the first two thirds (but, what a glorious, facinating banter it is, as only QT can do), the film is genuinely suspenseful, and thrilling, in a disturbing, train-wreck element of the series of car-chase finales that wrap things up.
B000000W5L|3.0|It would be easy to find 2 or 3 Stones albums to take the place of Exile as the \\"Stones Best\\". I find Exile very slim on classic Stones tunes. If you enjoy the Stones playing acoustic blues-based songs this is a great album. If, however, you prefer the Stones playing their great, crafted songs, then choose something else, as this is more for the well-versed and initiated in the Stones. I would start with \\"Let It Bleed\\", \\"Sticky Fingers\\", Beggar's Banquet\\" or \\"Some Girls\\" even..    Don't get me wrong--Exile is an excellent album, but instead of being a quintessential Stones masterpiece, I would call it an encapsulation of the top British Blues Band playing their nod to great American Blues.    I think even the Stones would have agreed back in '72 when Exile was released. This was just after they had started their own label, and they were more isolated in the studio, arguably more in the throes of drug addiction, and they weren't at their creative peak. Interestingly the prior album Sticky Fingers--their first on their own label--is arguably their strongest album, but probably Let It Bleed is their greatest achievement. All the songs are strong and original on Let It Bleed (with plenty of blues to knock your socks off, and great slide work by Brian Jones). I think they were still struggling and Mick Taylor's contribution would not really come forward until later.    So basically I'm saying that if you acknowledge the Rolling Stones' best era as being between '68 and '78, mostly the Mick Taylor era with some early Ron Wood at the tail end of it, then Exile is certainly an important work. But if you realize how capable the Stones were of writing incredible tunes, then you have to admit that Exile on Main Street is a second-rate effort song-wise. It is still a great album by any standards, though...
0786838655|4.0|This is the first book in the series by Rick Riordan about Percy and the Olympians.  I've been wanting to read this series for quite a while and finally got around to it.  I listened to this on audio book and the audio book production was very good; I have no complaints about that at all!  The content of the book itself was also very enjoyable.<br /><br />This book follows Percy who has been labeled as a juvenile delinquent because of his ability to always get into trouble and his learning disabilities (dyslexia and ADD).  Percy quickly finds out that there is a reason for his problems.  Percy is actually a half-blood; his father is a god.  More shockingly his father is one of the three main Greek gods that promised never to sire another child.  Percy is framed for stealing Zeus's lightening bolt and must find the bolt to prove that he is innocent.  Percy gets assistance from a couple of unlikley sources; his best friend Grover (whom he finds out is a satyr) and another half-blood named Annabeth who is a daughter of Athena.  The would be heroes encounter many familar foes along their travels; among them Medusa, Cerberus and Ares.<br /><br />I surprisingly really liked this book.  I liked the incorporation of Greek mythology (which I've always really enjoyed) into a young adult fantasy novel.  The book had a little of a Harry Potter tone to it with Percy being sent off to camp half-blood.  This book is more tongue-in-cheek and uses a lot of slang and modern language and this makes it much different from Harry Potter.  I also found myself drawing comparisons between this book and Abarat.  Percy lives in a similar home situation to what Candy Quakenbush did.  I always felt bad for Candy's mom being married to such a horrible man and kind of angry at Candy's mom for not changing her situation.  I liked Percy's mom a million times better because she had a reason for living with her idiot husband and once his usefulness was done she...took care of him.<br /><br />It was a quick, fun listen.  I didn't necessarily like Percy as a character a whole lot but his character worked well for the book and the situation he was in.  It is a creative book and an interesting book.  My only complaints would be the quality of the writing.  It's definitely written in a very off-hand style, most likely to appeal to the young reader age group.  Sometimes the slang and frequent fits of self-pity Percy went through got kind of distracting and annoying.  These are minor quips though; all-in-all it was a very good book and I am already listening to the next one.<br />[...]didn't necessarily like Percy as a character a whole lot but his character worked well for the book and the situation he was in.

0143038419|2.0|Skimming previous EAT, PRAY, LOVE reviews, I see readers had one of the two reactions I had, if not both to this autobiographical story of an American woman who leaves her husband and rediscovers herself on trips to Italy, India and Indonesia.      My first reaction: Author Elizabeth Gilbert writes well and takes the risk of pouring her feelings all over her book's  pages.      And my second reaction: Maybe she went through a costly divorce, but in EAT, PRAY, LOVE author Gilbert sounds as though it was not too much trouble bouncing back financially, so why was she feeling sorry for herself for practically the whole book?  Better to be a divorced Yuppie than the typical American earning $15,000 or less annually whose marriage breaks up.  If Elizabeth Gilbert really thinks she had troubles, she should read Barbara Ehrenreich's book NICKEL AND DIMED: ON (NOT) GETTING BY IN AMERICA.  Most women who walk out on their husbands don't take off for Italy; they are lucky to have the bus fare to go home to their mothers.    And while Elizabeth Gilbert speaks of her ex-husband hating her for leaving him, I noticed she had to mention that during their marriage she was tired of being the primary breadwinner.  That cheap shot reveals Ms. Gilbert resented him for failing as a Yuppie as much as or more than he resented her for divorcing him.    Finally, in EAT, PRAY, LOVE Elizabeth Gilbert makes herself sound pretty attractive (tall, blonde) and writes of her travels to some of the world's beautiful locations.  But don't expect any pictures (save a thumbnail of the author's face) if you pick up this book although it is reasonable to think it would include some.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|Stargate SG-1 has been a staple of the science fiction scene for years. Although not as thought-provoking as some series (Bablyon 5 perhaps), it has consistently delivered good-quality scripts and solid performances from the main actors.<br /><br />Stargate - The Ark of Truth is a real treat for SG-1 fans everywhere. For a start you can really see the quality difference between the series and the movie. It also seems as if the script writers had more time to ensure that each characters idiosyncrasies came out more than in the series. Christopher Judge, in particular, is given a plumb piece of dialog delivered with just the right amount of gravitas.<br /><br />A few genuinely surprising moments made the movie seem even fresher and, unlike some of the reviewers, I did not feel that the ending was either forced or sudden. It was a natural closure to the story line and I felt genuinely satisfied that it was done proper justice.<br /><br />Its not without its flaws, but is WAY better than just about any direct to DVD release and better than many movies that play in theatres.

0307387178|3.0|It was pretty good.  I wouldn't classify it as award-winning or anything like that.  It was an interesting read.  He basically wraps a few other interesting tales and philosophical essays around the tale of Chris McCandless.  Krakauer is a good writer. You can tell he thoroughly researched the details of the story.  When he detailed his very convincing theory about what killed McCandless, I remember thinking, \\"I can't believe he put this much effort into it.\\"  You have to admire that.  It definetly makes you think about the paths you choose in life.  Who hasn't thought about taking off into the wild at one time or another.  I played in the Utah desert for a week once.  It was great, but I was ready to go home.  He did this kind of stuff for 2+ years.  I'm not going to rant about whether McCandless was a fool or not.  The beauty of America is that you CAN give up all your possesions and go into the wild if you want.  That's what he wanted to do, so who cares if he was experienced or not.  It was his choice, I think he understood that, and I think he would accept responsibility for it.  My only complaint about Krakauer is that he occasionally uses words that I have no idea what they mean.  I know; I can just look them up and then I know a new word.  Just a minor complaint.
B000WTBMBK|5.0|I really connect with this album. I'm not absolutely sure why, but perhaps it's because the music seems to take me to a place that I'm not at now, but that I want to be. It seems to encourage sense of wonder and discovery, which was probably was Burial was feeling when he was creating this album.    The style is not entirely retro, but it takes me back to a time when music ignited a feeling of curiosity in me. It's what I felt when I found my first favorite radio station that played music that I liked 24 hours a day. I wasn't really familiar with music at that time, but every sound that I heard seemed altogether new and interesting.     For Burial to make an album that inspired the same feelings from my childhood when I'm now past the age of 20 is truly remarkable. It's the kind of spark that is missing from most albums that come out nowadays, but I'll be satisfied as long as an album like this comes out every once in a while.

B000002J03|3.0|Zeppelin's second album is good, but weaker than people will have you believe.  You see, radio stations like to try and convince us that it's the second or third best album the band ever made, but that's not true at all.  Their very best albums were Houses of the Holy and Physical Graffiti.  This album was also recorded rather poorly, which explains why it sounds severely dated.  It does affect the listening experience as well, because all that noise in the middle of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" is hard to sit through.  Why anyone could consider that song a classic with all that annoying noise in the middle is beyond me.     I won't knock \\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\" because that song IS a classic.  The build-up to the loud chorus rules and grabs my attention every time.  \\"The Lemon Song\\" is another great song.  The band was good at the blues.  I also love \\"Thank You\\" a lot.  A beautiful ballad.     The second side has a few weakpoints that simply get old in a hurry.  The guitar riff that opens up \\"Heartbreaker\\" is nice, but doesn't excite me nearly as much as it did when I first heard it many years ago.  The rest of the song passes by harmlessly without really exciting me the entire time.  An okay riff, and alright vocals.  No more needs to be said about it.  \\"Living Loving Maid\\" pretty much stinks though.  I don't know WHAT the band was thinking putting this song on record.  \\"Ramble On\\" is even worse.  It never really picks up or goes anywhere.  I guess it was supposed to copy what \\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\" did, but it fails because the vocals never really come together to create a good melody.  The long drum solo is pointless and \\"Bring It on Home\\" is a decent way to end the album.     No classic, just a nice hard rock album that bands like James Gang, Humble Pie, and Captain Beyond did a LOT better.

Mystics who've allowed this Enlightenment/Gnosis/Cosmic Consciousness (so many names, so many who've been there, are there, are going there, as we all are when we \\"die\\") have been trying since the year dot to guide people towards that same awakening.  Ancient mystery religions taught all this and initiated people into direct experience of the divine.  Here Tolle is trying to explain the nature of reality and he does a somewhat fair job of it.  He can't compare to the Sutras or Lao Tzu or Seth or a number of others I've read but he's trying...perhaps too hard and in language lacking the kind of poetry that catches at the heart and drags the soul along.  Tolle is riding a crest of a global search for meaning, and good for him.  But there are better sources out there.  I KNOW, as do many, what he's trying to describe.  If you want a grand adventure as well as beautiful accessible writing as well as a real grasp of what Tolle is laboriously trying to say, I HIGHLY recommend [[ASIN:0307346676 The Secret Magdalene: A Novel]] by Ki Longfellow.  This book is my touchstone for all others.
B0012BTBQU|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and am so thankful for one of the reviewers of this book who said that they were hesitant to read The Final Empire because Elantris was a let down.  However, the reviewer loved The Final Empire so I picked it up and am glad I did.  This book is so much better paced than Mr. Sanderson's Elantris.  The Final Empire has a good story, great characters, and a cool well thought out magic system which sets up for some thrilling action sequences.  This is a thoroughly entertaining ride.  I look forward to reading its sequel. Hope you enjoy and thank you to all other reviewers who help us find some great gems!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Quite honestly, a lot of the time a film that gets high reviews just doesn't live up to the hype.  Fortunately, this wasn't one of them!  In part because of the other reviews on this site, and in part because of the quality of the show, I went into the experience with high expectations.  I'm glad to say that the movie did NOT disappoint!    The writers, cast, and crew did an excellent job wrapping up the loose ends from the series (although because of the timing of the releases, I'm a bit confused about where the movie exists -- with Carter LEADING Atlantis AND still an active member of SG-1, I'm trying to figure out how she seems to be in two places at the same time...) and the end of the movie is very satisfying.  (When it ended, all I could think was \\"And... THAT's why I love this show!\\" == with a bit of Mitchell's enthusiasm...)    Unfortunately, there isn't much here for viewers who haven't been following the series -- especially the last few seasons.  So if you're looking to start with a movie, my suggestion would be to begin with either the original Stargate film or with the pilot for the first season.    There ARE a few surprises for fans, though, even while they are working to wrap up the series.  As mentioned in other reviews, the bigger budget shows in the quality of the sound and picture.  One nice thing about the longer format (aside from just getting more of the good stuff) is that they took the time to really develop the film and bring everything together without it seeming like they wrapped everything up in the last five or ten minutes with a deus ex or some other plot contrivance.    In short, if you're a fan of the series, you have GOT to buy this!  (This is my first review on Amazon.com, and I felt like I just HAD to say something.  If any of the writers, cast, or crew happen to read this, GREAT job!)
1401302378|4.0|The future commerce revealed, this book explains \\"in English\\" the effect new media (and by my generation) has had on today's and tomorrow's economy...
B000ULQV0W|5.0|What a beautiful tribute to an amazing story. Eddie Vedder got it right.  It's powerful and emotional and timeless.  I read the book while listening to the cd and it made it soooo emotional for me.  I found myself reading each chapter a few times over...just to keep Chris McCandless alive for a bit longer.  Kudos to Eddie Vedder...this is a true soundtrack.
B0000057D8|5.0|If you like baroque music. If you like (or love) Bach, then seek no further! Trevor Pinnock is your man!  It's difficult to believe, I know, but every single recording the man has made (at least, as far as I can see) is superb or excellent or at least very good. So, if these classics are what you're after, this classic recording of Bach's Orchestral Suites and Brandenburgs is the one to have. Excellent sound, packaging, notes, photos.  Get it!
B0010YSD7M|4.0|Excellent ending to Stargate SG-1. An Epic space battle would have been more fun. The very end kinda sucked, but I suppose it leaves room for more SG-1 movies (which would be good by the way). They seemed a little desperate to add conflict by adding the replicators. But overall the replicators were a good familiar foe to tie the movie with the series.
B00002DEGZ|5.0|John Eliot Gardner and Malcolm Bilson are to be thanked for giving us such a superb release of all of Mozart's original piano concerti on original instruments of Mozart's time. These are brisk and bracing as well as dramatic and even dancing versions of these timeless classics. Bilson is an excellent fortepianist and Gardner and his band provide great performances of their parts, making this an essential set.  There are other good and great performances of these works, either seperately or complete (such as those by Brendel, Uchida, Perahia, et al.), but these are special.  Excellent sound and good packaging and notes.
B000J103YI|5.0|If you enjoyed the movie, now enjoy the music. Great complilation of songs from the motion picture soundtrack. A worthy add to anyone who enjoyed the movie as well as good music.
B000059MEL|5.0|I've owned this album on CD and MP3 formats for many years, and it is among my top favorites.  I have DJ'ed many places and songs from this album always end up in my playlists and are always a hit, no matter the crowd.    Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, I decided to purchase this album in Vinyl.  It changed the way I look at the album.  Definitely one of the best, and even better in the purest format known to man.    If you haven't heard this album, you must, and if you can, hear it on Vinyl.
0375842381|5.0|Pullman has created an amazing and complex story in 3 parts. As an adult I appreciate the nuances and the depth of his imagination and knowledge in creating such an intricately constructed and balanced book. His book raises very interesting issues and questions about the narrow beliefs that many of us hold or cater to or blindly follow. If your mind is not already open to these things, it soon will be.
B00003CWTI|5.0|This movie astounded me when I saw it. The acting is brilliant. The cinematography is brilliant. And the script.....wow! I think Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the best American directors and hopefully over time and through his career which is already amazing (There Will BE Blood, Boogie NIghts, Punch DRunk Love, Hard EIght) he will be included alongside other great American Directors such as John Huston and Robert Altman. For the people that find it too long and boring, you must just have different tastes in movies or sumthing. Because I have watched this movie like ten minutes and the film moves so fast that I was barely aware that I was watching this movie for three hours.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|The Ark of Truth is supposed to tie up all the hanging storylines from the sadly cancelled Stargate series.  However, there are still unresolved stories -- like whatever happened to the Harsesis (spelling correct?) child, or Laira from A Hundred Days, or the Tok'ra.  Were all the Tolans really killed, so whatever happened to Schroedinger the cat?  What about the Furlings, and who are the enemy/rescuers in episodes Enemies and Grace?  The Ori story thankfully comes to an end, but not a spectacular one.  It would have been far more interesting to have gotten all the Ancients to finally have battled the Ori, but the writers didn't go there.  Still, this episode is quite good, with really fine acting from Shanks and Tapping and Judge.  For the Farscape cast, Claudia Black seems a bit out of character, like she's tired of Vala (so am I) -- and a grinning Tomin doesn't seem quite right either -- but Browder does well, right in character, though he does get beaten up a lot.  The soundtrack is often intrusive, as if they want you to know that this is a true film and not just part of the series, where the soundtrack never intruded.  And there are portions that include singing like Gregorian chants, okay if you like that stuff but annoying otherwise.  Sorry to say, the writers also brought back an old, dead plot element -- it seems like whenever they don't know what to do, either in SG-1 or Atlantis, they resurrect the replicators.  Ho-hum.  And at the end, they could have spent a bit more time building the drama, since for me it fell a little flat.  I did enjoy Beau Bridges, who is the best of the Stargate generals.  Despite some disappointments, though, it's an entertaining episode, although I have to admit the the second time I viewed it, I got a little bored . . .
B000001G7O|4.0|Mutter plays with great tone, vibrato, and expression.  The recording is actually very enjoyable and beautiful to me whenever I listen to it.    However, I prefer a slightly faster tempo for Tchaikovsky.
0446577391|5.0|This book is great. Very well plotted. Much better than the last book in the series. I can't wait for the next Camel Club book.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Spoilers are fun, but I'm going to be careful not to give anything away here, since not everyone agrees with me about the fun thing. I have to say up front that I loved the movie, not so much because it was the best episode of the series but because this was the series wrap-up that was missing from the final episodes of season 10. I liked how the arcs came together and how the characters seemed just as easy to like as always. The action was dramatic and exciting and drove the story to a satisfying conclusion.    If you liked Tomin from the series, you'll enjoy seeing him again here. He plays a key role, and I was thrilled to see his character again. I also liked the parallels between him and Teal'c.    I imagine the show will be easy to watch again and I'm already looking forward to seeing certain scenes replayed.    Despite my love of Stargate and my love of this show, it had its flaws.    To be frank, I thought most of the tricks that were meant to make the movie more like a \\"real\\" movie were a waste of time and storytelling space. Thinking back, I must say that this wasn't any better (if not even as good) as many of the two part episodes from the series, such as The Lost City, Full Circle, Exodus/Enemies, and others.    Many of the characters seemed to be stick figures. Landry's part in the movie could just as easily have been left out for all but one scene. Teal'c's \\"walk\\" seemed unlikely at best, and blatantly ridiculous at worst. The difference between the feel of the movie and the series jarred.    However, I would certainly recommend this movie to anyone who likes Stargate SG-1. It's a lovely tribute to the last two years of the series.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|This review is spoiler free!!<br /><br />I have to preface this review with the statement that I am an avid Stargate fan, and as such, my review may be biased (but I think not!)<br /><br />After enduring season 4 of Atlantis this year, it is nice to get back to the show I truly love, Sg-1.  Opposed to Atlantis, SG-1 takes place on earth, spends time on the explorations, and takes into account ancient mythologies, opposed to Atlantis, which is more action oriented, with dumbed down dialog, and shooting anything that moves.<br /><br />I have been awaiting this release since it was announced, it finally came to my home yesterday, I watched the movie, then the extras (comic con conference which was really cool! and a behind the scenes which was great as well (this is almost 1 hour of material), I then watched the movie again, this time with commentary (again, I love SG-1).<br /><br />This dvd has a \\"prelude\\" which basically goes over everything you need to freshen up on to fully enjoy and prepare for this viewing.  As someone who has seen each episode of stargate countless times, I found this prelude a great review, as it has been a while since I watched it all.<br /><br />The movie then follows, and it is a great movie. The scenery in this movie is astounding, it looks much better than we are used to seeing on the TV show.  The pacing is slower, more akin to when the show aired on Showtime, which works well, as the aspect of stargate that i enjoy most, is the interactions between the characters, the explorations of new worlds and civilizations, and how everyone reacts to the culture.<br /><br />This brings the conclusion to a satisfying end.  I think several of the cliffhangers are drawn out a bit much (putting a tad too much tension near the end), but all in all, I enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />This reminds me of why I love this show, I know they are coming out with another movie soon (this one will have Richard Dean Anderson in it), and word on the streets is, it should arrive this July.<br /><br />I truly hope people are not just downloading bootleg copies of this dvd, and I really hope everyone will buy this dvd, and the next one.  I really want this show to continue on, if the studios do not get the results they are looking for, this could be the end.<br /><br />I really hope the dvds do sell well, maybe they can continue to do movies throughout the year, and maybe even a mini series or another season.  There are many aspects of the Stargate world that have gone unexplored, and unfinished.<br /><br />I hope the producers read this review, and understand that what make stargate work is not the snappy dialog, the wonderful interactions, the brilliantly designed enemies, sound design, artwork, and constant tension, but the exploration of new worlds, the ability to learn something (ancient history, see ancient figures, the Egyptian gods) and the exploration of these foreign cultures.  Something Stargate Atlantis completely misses, which is why I do not enjoy it as much.<br /><br />I truly hope everyone will buy this dvd, enjoy it, and more get made.<br /><br />I also must comment on the beautiful video quality and sound design, the show has never looked or sounded this good (they did use 35mm film) and it shows.<br /><br />Please keep up the great work, and I hope everyone enjoys this fantastic dvd.<br /><br />(note, if you are a fan of the movie, and haven't watched too much of the series (last 2 seasons--9 and 10) this dvd is likely not for you, do yourself a favor, and buy the complete series collection, and catch up, then enjoy this fantastic dvd, as you will not be able to understand much of what is going on)<br /><br />Also, the creators of the show, are working on a third show, that deals with the ninth chevron, tentatively called \\"Stargate Universe\\" which is set in present time.  I really hope this will be the return of intellectual Stargate, and I eagerly await its arrival on TV.uld arrive this July.<br /><br />I truly hope people are not just downloading bootleg copies of this dvd, and I really hope everyone will buy this dvd, and the next one.

B000J4QWMC|5.0|I recieved my disc and I couldnt even tell it wasnt new. Very fast shipping. I had it in hand before the computer gave me a ship date. Thanks
B0010YSD7M|4.0|[[ASIN:B0010YSD7M Stargate - The Ark of Truth]]<br />The movie was awesome. No problem there. But I've one little issue. I found the quality of the actual dvd-playback to be seriously wanting. It was almost like watching VHS quality footage. The picture was clearer watching SG1 on regular tv. That was my only beef... the pic fuzziness.
B000HEWEEY|4.0|Realized by many as the greatest sci-fi film of all time, Forbidden Planet comes in an amazing set. It has a ton of great bonus features like great documentaries, a wonderful show about the creation of the most iconic robot in history, Robby, and an episode of an old tv show in which Robby was the star. Also included is Robby's follow up film venture, The Invisible Boy. There are also interviews with the surviving members of the cast, though it is somewhat strange seeing how people have aged, much less shocking, though, if you've seen them in any recent movies/shows. Forbidden Planet has never looked so good ! The colours are incredibly vivid and the sound is amazing. All the classic sci-fi sound effects are here, and are at there best here as well. Probably the best extra is the small, greatly detailed, Robby The Robot figurine that comes with the set.If you're any kind of sci-fi fan at all, you have to get this 2 disc set. The movie will never look better than it does here. Even the HD-DVD can't look any better. The movie is 50 years old and HD won't make any difference in the picture quality. This is as good as it will ever be ! Get this set !!!
B000001GQB|4.0|This set my have fallen in recommendability a little recently according to some of the so called professional reviewers, but to me it is still one of the best. Bohm brings out the details and intricacies like few other conductors. Of course, there are many other exceptional recordings of Mozart's symphonies, by such conductors as George Szell, Erich Kleiber, Bruno Walter, Josef Krips and so forth. Bottom line is this is an excellent set that is easily recommended, especially when compared to period performances. Another reviewer called this the worst Mozart recording ever. Huh!? I can understand liking other performances better than Bohm's, but that is one of the most laughably ridiculous statements I have ever had the misfortune to read. 4 1/2 stars.
B0002PZVH0|5.0|First done as an installation piece for the Flughafen Tegel in Berlin in 1983, where a number of sonic installation pieces were being done at the time, the piece doesn't really have a beginning, middle or end.  Neither do you have to *listen* to it to get it. The tones sit in the background, intelligent configured, but not invasive. Ready for you when you are ready for them.  Nice.
0553382179|5.0|I love Flylady.  I wouldn't get through most weeks if I didn't do it 15 minutes at a time!
B00104QSOM|5.0|This film isn't for everyone.  If you can't watch a movie over 2.5 hours long, and if you have to like at least 1 character, then this probably isn't for you.  It's relentless, vicious, a look into the mind of a greedy oil man.  I think it's amazing though.    Of course, Daniel Day-Lewis is absolutely phenomenal.  He deserved every award he received.  Paul Dano surprised me, though.  I heard some negative things about him, but I thought he was great.    The cinematography, directing and score are also fantastic.  Visually, it is stunning.  Every shot is near perfect.  It wasn't eligible for score, but I have a feeling it might have beaten \\"Atonement\\" for the Oscar.      I thoroughly recommend this.. It's just brilliant.
B00005JMK0|5.0|Sorry for the bad English Im from Mexico<br />I was just a kid when this movie came out but I have very good memories coming from it. I remember I used to play the record with the music over and over. (the duet of the computer and the chelo is great)<br /><br />I hope the studio decide to make a DVD, definitively is going to make many people happy with it (including the kid inside your friend)
B0012K1ILW|5.0|It's jaw-dropping how Ms. Badu can flip from Neo-Soul Princess to Neo-Soul Priestess. Yep, it's hard. Yep, it's deep. And yep, it's brilliant!  When the music ends, it feels like a multi-disc release. And with that, my only complaint is not having the second disc to keep the vibe alive. Although I can't see them all coming this hard, I can only hope that New Amerykah, Pts. 1-3 are complete and that this isn't \\"a test.\\"     Apr 11 2008 ADDENDUM:  I'm amazed at all the 1-star reviews here. It seems that most were expecting a CD dripping with Honey. Honestly, Honey is my least favorite song... perhaps because it's the most commercially accessible. Odd that it appears to not have been intended for this release. I even read that someone's CD didn't even include it... maybe an early pressing or a promo.     Anyway, I love this dics even more now. There are some incredibly beautiful and important messages here. The beats are, more often than not, hard (as hinted at in my original review) but war isn't pretty. Is it?       I've caught vid clips on Youtube and these songs work extremely well live. Try locating \\"That Hump.\\" Heavenly!    This isn't the type of CD you pop in your car and blast while speeding away from the mall. Give it a 2nd listen.     It needs your \\"undivided\\" attention.
0525950079|3.0|I love the reviewer who said it should be called \\"The Book Without End\\". She is so right. Although it's an incredible piece of work it is certainly no \\"Pillars...\\" It took me 300 pages to get into it and if it hadn't been Ken Follett I would never have given it that long.  If reading is your pleasure, but your reading time is at a premium right now, save this book for retirement.
B00006G8K0|5.0|This is the movie that redefined how vampires would be portrayed on the screen for all time.  Christopher Lee makes the character his own.  No one before or since has injected so sinister a villain with so much charisma and sex appeal.  Peter Cushing is perfect cast as the vampire hunter Van Helsing.  No collection is complete without this cinematic gem.
B0010ZR160|5.0|When a young girl is taken from her home in broad daylight, a young private detective is her only defense against the child-kidnapping statistics. To get her alive, she must be found almost immediately and the clock has already been ticking. The detective, an unlikely toughguy, is getting little help from the police and no help at all from the girl's mother. He will have to face many physical and moral conflicts if he hopes to find her.     This movie was very good, but I liked it for the story and not the acting. Casey Affleck was very unbelievable as the hard-nosed private detective who pushed the limits to get the answers he wanted. Michelle Monaghan was in the movie just so there was a pretty girl on screen occasionally. The back of the DVD acclaims Morgan Freeman's performance, but it only does so to mention he's in the movie so you'll have another reason to want to see it. His part is minor and he is good as always, but it is too small of a part to base your decision on. But there was some good acting among all this.    Amy Ryan was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her role as the missing child's uncooperative mother. She was great, and her performance is worth seeing if you like to catch up on the Oscar nods.     Maybe my fanboy bias will come through a little here, but I can't help it; I am a big Ed Harris fan. He shares a lot of scenes with Casey, which helped neutralize how ridiculous the young Affleck was at times. He does good work, but Amy Ryan is still your star.     The story is almost classic pulp in the way it had some over-the-top dialogue and a quickened pace. It moves along very fluidly and I never had that \\"check my watch and see how much is left\\" itch.     Another thing I should mention - and I wish I had links to support this - is Ben Affleck's directorial debut. I have heard/read many reviews of this movie that say that Ben has shown on which side of the camera he belongs (my apologies for not being able to give credit to the originator of that comment). I'm afraid that is more of a jab at his much maligned career on-screen rather than praise for his successful first-attempt at directing, however. But for whatever little it's worth, I thought he added to the feel of the movie, especially with the shots of the Boston neighborhoods that reminded me of what Spike Lee did for New York in [[ASIN:0783230443 Clockers]] (and pretty much every other movie he's made).     Gone Baby Gone was a great story and one that leaves watchers tangled up in the same moral dilemmas the characters faced. I enjoyed the puzzles the plot created and how they were put together. Some performances weren't the best, but Amy Ryan was very deserving of the Oscar nomination she received for this part and maybe you should see it just to judge for yourself if she should have won, if nothing else.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|DEPP was Picture Perfect in his role of the muderoud TODD. A well desserved OSCAR NOMINATION. The music and score is outstanding and the costumes and sets are picture perfect!!

1400079179|1.0|This is the worst book I have ever read. I read it because everyone around me raved about it: how interesting and intriguing it was, how much it made them want to learn more about Christ, etc etc. While I do admit that it did make people want to research and learn, there are more than a few points about this book that make it bad:<br />1) Style of writing. His style is awkward, amateur at best, like someone's who has absolutely no training nor affinity for writing. The sentence structure is horrible. The dialogue is stale and predictable.<br /><br />2) Boring and predictable plot. It reminded me of a computer language loop that goes from 1 to 4 and goes something like this: the apostle is dying, we need to save him, let's decode by which method and where he is dying, let's rush there, oops we didn't make it. The plot is recycled from \\"Angels and Demons\\", where very similar thing happens, albeit with a  slightly different theme. And then there is the cheese factor.<br /><br />3) Lack of character development<br /><br />These are just the few things that are wrong with the book in a pure literary sense.<br /><br />As far as the historical plot, well, if you are interested in occult, go and read some non-fiction. Do your research.<br /><br />To summarize, this book holds absolutely no value as a work of fiction since it basically fails to deliver on every point where great books should deliver. Read it on the beach, and throw it in the trash, or better yet....don't waste your time.
1400079179|5.0|How big is this book? Literally how many pages? A ton.  It doesn't matter.  No really it doesn't matter.  I got on a plane in Philly headed to Palm Springs.  I flew across the country reading the whole way, drove from LAX to Palm Springs.  I kept thinking about this twist, that charactor and talking to myself about it the entire drive.  I got to the hotel at Midnight (3 am my time)and ordered some non-airplane food and sat up to read until 4 am west coast time.  Is that insane?  I enjoy reading don't get me wrong, but this was horrible, in a good way.  I could not put it down.<br />The next morning, I was by the pool by nine am.  I was in my cabana reading all morning.  I was so wrapped up that Lisa Rinna and Harry Hamil were in the cabana next to me and rather than listen in to movie star conversation, I read the book.  Even when she came into my cabana to get her daughter's toy, rather than enter into polite I acknowledged her and went back to my book.  What does that tell you about the book?
B00000634J|4.0|... your appreciation of lennon's solo output cannot be complete until you listen to/possess two of lennon's best albums : imagine and jl/plastic ono band.     there are only two tracks from each of the two albums in this collection.    with these two albums and this collection which also incidentally favors  (6 tracks!)lennon's other great album \\"double fantasy\\", you will have a strong representation of lennon's best solo work.    btw i cannot comprehend how anybody can leave out such a beautiful number like \\"hold on\\" from any lennon best of/collection.
0307387178|5.0|I loved this book. I thought it was just so engrossing--it captured the lost soul in all of us, wandering around trying to find where we fit in. I often think that Chris looked at his interactions with people much like he did with nature--to not leave a footprint. But he did on every human being that came in contact with him, and I'm just sad that he didn't realize how impactful he was on so many lives. This book is great for personal reflection, understanding of the human condition, and just about who we are in relation to the world. Everyone will have their opinion--about who he was, what this journey meant, etc.--but I will reserve mine because I think that many can say that the book written about them might be different than how they perceived their life. Just a phenomenal story and writer.
B0002YCVXI|1.0|Beware,the media after a while willl disapper from your cd. The cd has a 1-800 number to call. It is disconnected.I guess Sony produces so many duds it dosen't want to provide service anymore. This Sony CD is high priced junk. After a year all the music has gone poof into nowhere. Just cheap junk.
B00004RFCM|4.0|Very happy with the product that I purchased.  Only negative feedback is that an episode listing is missing, although easy enough to download this off the internet.  Also the cover is a little flimsy and not a standard locking case.  Other than the superficial aspects, the dvd's are great.

B000WCBPOG|5.0|This soundtrack is so awesome that it defies any explanation.  Most of the songs on here are so wonderful that it almost brings me to tears.  The re mastering of Beatles' songs is pitch perfect. In some of them such as , I am the walrus it is hard to tell when listening if you are tripping out or just singing along.  I would so highly recommend this soundtrack because it is some of the most wonderful music i have ever heard.
B000ULQV0W|1.0|As others have said, this is definitely NOT a \\"soundtrack\\" recording.  In fact, the whole Eddie Vedder presentation has absolutely NO relationship to the actual music that was in the movie.  That music was beautiful, sensitive, poignant and very appropriate for the story.  This recording is just noisy.  I suppose if you're an Eddie Vedder fan you'll lap it up.  But don't buy it if you think it has any connection to a sensitive, poignant, meaningful, well-acted, and ultimately a very tragic film.     Russ Heitz  russheitz.com

0784011710|5.0|Quite simply, Sophie's Choice remains, for me, the most unforgettable Nazi concentration-camp movies ever made. In fact, because it is not ENTIRELY set during WWII, it has the Shakespearean \\"comic relief\\" that the Bard included to break the tragedy long enough to let the viewer \\"catch their breath\\".<br />And, of course, this is truly needed to offset and heighten the ultimate tragedy. A MUST for ANY serious film collector.

B0001HAHXW|1.0|I played it 1-1/2 times...then it became litter.    The cover showing Clapton in a stark setting, acoustic guitar in hand, led me to believe this would be an \\" solo acoustic blues\\" album, befitting a \\"tribute\\" to RJ.    WRONG.    Slick, over produced, over-blown, and most especially, over-instrumented, this disc sounds like a \\"Chicago Blues\\" session...    Yes, I disliked this take on Robert Johnson very much.    To Eric Clapton:    Listen to Rory Block doing Johnson....    [[ASIN:B000F5GKO0 The Lady and Mr. Johnson]]    That's how to show tribute...Smokin'!!
1427200882|2.0|This book should earn 5 stars for covering an extremely important topic.  Klein reveals an important aspect of the Bush administration and the neocons in general, something that has always confused me... Why does the Bush administration always seem to make the worst decisions possible?  The answer is of course they are driven by an extreme ideology.<br /><br />This book loses a star for being written in a disingenuous matter.  The phraseology used in this book is emotionally manipulative and hollow.  Every word seems designed to elicit sympathy for whomever Naomi designates as a victim.<br /><br />The book loses another star for its preoccupation with torture.  There are some parallels to the books main theme and torture, but they don't deserve nearly as much treatment as they get.  Once again this is done for emotional value.<br /><br />Lastly, the book loses another star for its unabashed socialist attitude.  Naomi's hate of corporations and capitalism is plain.  She constantly paints corporate failures as something a government entity wouldn't allow to happen -- She forgets that governments and corporations are both made up of people and both are at least as likely to be incompetent.<br /><br />In addition continually approaches problems from the socialist premise that the government owes people things -- once again forgetting that the government is just ordinary and often below average people, and that it cannot give you anything which it did not take from you.<br /><br />If there was any other book on the subject, I would recommend it.  Until then its important to be aware of the issue, so read this book if you can.
B0011TQLA2|5.0|Bought this today (well, it's just after midnight here, so yesterday).  I dig it!  A slight continuation of the style of the previous three albums, but with some fresh twists on the guitar work, and a few straight-ahead and textured rock songs.    Though the old school fans will point to \\"OK Computer\\" and previous albums, I am a fan from \\"Kid A\\" to the present only.  I'd say this is as close as they've come to their pre-\\"Kid A\\" era, yet it possesses the freshness and experimental vibe of their more recent work.    Great disc!  A little on the short side, time-wise, but still sweet.
0452289963|5.0|though \\"A New Earth\\" may not be the absolute answer to all this worlds woe's it is absolutely an insightful, enlightening and very worth while read.  Even though Tolle creates some sort of new age vague sort of language his message is clear... Stay awake. Be aware of the disfunction in your self and others. He may, though, lack any emphasis on recognizing the innate beauty in every creature by instructing us to ever beware of ego. None-the-less, I find myself reading it a second time. And this time very slowly as Tolle has a message the whole world must hear and heed.
1430300612|5.0|This is, indeed, a first-person description of stroke by a scientifically and dare I say it -- spiritually --  sophisticated person.  The author describes a range of experiences that make sense given our knowledge of localization of function.  I'm not sure that such a detailed and consistent report by a scientist is available anywhere else. As such, this story is unusual and important.  Moreover the author reports how she turned her stroke into an opportunity for profound wisdom and insight.  Amazing stuff!  And this may save lives.<br /><br />Personally, I don't share all the author's ideas about strict functional localization in the brain... but that is secondary and doesn't detract from my admiration of her remarkable contribution.<br /><br />My enjoyment of this book was enhanced considerably by the material and links at the author's website.  She has posted a number of video and audio presentations, radio shows, etc.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Muse have been mocked as a Radiohead knock-off. To some degree one could hear the similarities, even with that said this album is still exceptional and powerfully original.<br /><br />Even with the noted similarities theirs no denying the originality that lies here.<br />\\"Knights of Cydonia\\" garnished some great interest with its odd natured music video and catchy spacey groove(and later appeared on the massively successful game 'Guitar Hero III:Legends of Rock'). Muse make their stay with the well to do bass savvy chime tingling tune \\"Starlight\\", which was an obvious take on a single.<br /><br />The album holds a wide array of falsetto scattered vocals and creative lyrics, and for once even a very optimistic song \\"Invincible\\". The song itself is truly motivational, giving you a 'I can take on everything, things are finally going to change' feel. The slow tempo \\"Soldier's Poem\\" is quite relaxing overlying vocals in the background and a soft acoustic to catch it from being a dull song. \\"Assassin\\" is familiar ground for Muse musically, but still a great speedy song (think Muse's \\"Hysteria\\" with less emphasis on the vocals and more on the beat).<br /><br />The mechanically processed, electronically doused \\"Map of Problematiqu\\" is my favorite song out of the album, opinions very. My reason for it is simple, great sound, unique, and holds multiple meanings.<br /><br />Each song is its on entity in this case,and show a strong separation from one another giving this album a high replay value. Not a definitive album<br />by the standards Muse have set so high, but a strong addition to their growing library. If you haven't herd the Muse yet, it may take a few listens to truly appreciate this album, if you like the sound already grab it you'll enjoy the entire album. If you're a fan of their previous works do you even need to read this?! Great album strong album for any musical library.

B0002STNQ2|4.0|Out of the many science fiction novels today, few are able to create a world real enough to fully engulf the reader.  Prey, by Michael Crichton, is one of those few.  It provides a rich story with not only the main plot, the escape of nano-particles that can reproduce, learn, and, to the demise of the inventors, hunt, but with sub plots that make the story much more real-to-earth.  Crichton's novel displays a mastery of language, and he uses his skills as a writer to effectively create a book that no reader is going to want to put down, with the exception of a few minor flaws.   Jack, the protagonist, worked in the computer programming industry until he was fired and blackballed after learning of corrupt management.  His wife, Julia, works for a nanotechnology company, Xymos.  She becomes more and more mysterious, to the point where Jack is sure she is cheating on him.  Jack is forced to stay at home and take care of the children, essentially turning into the maternal figure.  In many cases, he is even depicted in a grocery store buying diapers or in a furniture store debating the color of placemats.  Increasingly, Julia seems distracted with her work.  Jack is angry about a situation with his wife, Julia, who rarely comes home anymore: \\"In truth, that wasn't what I thought at all.  More and more, I regarded this as my house, and my kids.  She was barging into my house, late at night, when I'd gotten everything the way I liked it, the way it was.\\"  Things come to a peak when their youngest daughter wakes in the middle of the night swollen and red, screaming in pain.  Nothing seems to appease her pain, until she is given an MRI, and she instantly returns to normal.  After this event, Jack is asked to work for Xymos, puzzling him severely.  He accepts the job, and is puzzled to learn about the events at the Xymos lab.  The answers that he receives only confuse him more, resulting in a novel that takes turn after unexpected turn. The novel is riddled with eventsthat are seemingly unexplainable, and those events enhance the desire to keep reading, to find the explanation. Even the definition of human is questioned after the release of the nano-particle swarm.  For example, Crichton writes, \\"And then in a sudden rush Julia literally disintegrated before my eyes. The skin of her swollen face and body blew away from her in streams of particles, like sand blown off a sand dune.  The particles curved away in the arc of the magnetic field toward the sides of the room.\\"  With this information at hand, it is easy to see that reality begins to get shaky, to say the least.  Don't worry; this doesn't spoil anything too important in the novel.  Even in the final pages of the novel another turn occurs, keeping the reader captivated until that final page turn.    A few of Crichton's weaknesses do reveal themselves frequently though.  Generally, most science-fiction authors try to ease into the technical information, incorporating it into normal conversation until the reader knows everything.  In this novel, it is essentially dumped on you. For example, Crichton writes, \\"I saw a probe push what looked to be a tiny squid into position on a titanium field.\\"  Julia soon after states, \\"Our camera is one ten-billionth of an inch in length. [...] Microtubules in the tail provide stabilization, like the tail of a kite.  But they can also [...] provide locomotion. [...] That is the miniature gallium arsenide photon detector, acting as a retina, and the surrounding banded area [...] is bioluminescent, and lights the area ahead.\\"  I ask, \\"A miniature gallium arsenide photon detector?\\"  Obviously, you are barraged with information and some of it is difficult to believe, and even worse, some of it is wrong.  When Crichton is describing the methods used to produce the nano-particles, the methods are, in many cases, physically impossible to achieve, such as the presence of an electro-magnet that could never exist, one that can produce 33 Tesla.  This is over a million times the magnetic field of the earth, but, that aside, the story could not go on without it, so it has to stay.  Of course, it is science fiction; so much leeway can be given to the author to make the story sound, at a minimum, intelligent and interesting.       These small disadvantages aside, Crichton still has a way to instill trust and distrust on certain characters.  For example, never is Jack distrusted.  The reader is right there with him the whole way, allowing a connection to occur between character and reader.  This connection also accounts for the reader's emotional attachment to the events that take place.  Crichton does use this gift of his, though, to sometimes trick you, so watch out!      After reading this fast-paced thriller, which will literally have you questioning reality, I simply had the desire for more.  Even with its rather modest 350-page length, I could have handled another 100.  The way Crichton creates his characters, though sometimes shallow, creates a trust system between the reader and the character.  He is a master of exploiting simple writing techniques to convey a clear, concise meaning.  All of this together will leave you, and every one who reads it, with only one question.  Why is it over?
B000002O51|4.0|This was the first Boston album I heard.  It came out in 1986 as I was starting my senior year in high school, and I was hooked.  Later I discovered their earlier albums which are by far more memorable, but I still like Third Stage just because it was my first exposure to Boston, but for those who'd heard the earlier albums, they were not as impressed by this one.  At least it's better than \\"Walk On\\".  That was terrible!

0823013626|5.0|I had worked with polymer clay years ago and abandoned it as a medium. While watching reruns of Carol Duvall shows I would sketch and make notes about inspiring crafters and artists. I knew nothing of Donna Kato and as I looked back through my notes her name appeared again and again as work I had admired. This new book is an excellent addition to my resource library and I refer to it again and again as I practice polymer clay techniques with a new appreciation for the medium. The techniques are well described complete with specific brands of materials and clearly well-tested. A must-have.
0307346617|5.0|I can honestly say that this is the only book to have actually scared me (And I've wanted a book to scare me for so long!) It stayed with me and, embarrassingly, I even had nightmares for a few weeks afterwards. Something about zombies... they're just beyond horrifying. And, of course, this books full of them!    My favorite section was the interview near the beginning with the Coyote, the imagery was terrifying. I recommend this to any one looking for a seriously scary (and good) book, as long as you don't get frightened very easily.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|The original cut of Kingdom of Heaven was an intriguing and beautifully filmed take on the Crusades that, nevertheless, felt rushed and somehow lacking.  Orlando Bloom's character, Balain of Ibelin, was a passively written character propelled to great destiny by happenstance and instantly loved by the cast of kings, queens, and noble knights simply for being the son of a great man.      In Ridley Scott's director's cut, Balain is still passive and ridiculously lucky in his relationships, but he comes off as more human due to added scenes that clue you in on his past and how he came by his forty-yard stare.  Likewise, Liam Neeson, who plays Godfrey, Balain's father, is given a more complete character arc that lets Neeson stretch out and demonstrate why he's such an enjoyable actor to watch.  Hamstrung in Star Wars, Neeson returns to true Oscar calibur form here, allowing us to see the deep love he has for his son and the pain he has endured as a Crusader.  Godfrey, noble, sad, and scrappy (\\"I once fought two days with an arrow through my testicle,\\" he relates at one wry moment) is the true heart of the story and in the Director's Cut, he is given the time and care he deserved the first time around.    There isn't a single character who doesn't benefit by the restored 194 minute running time.  The beguiling Sybilla (played by Eva Green) is deepened via a subplot involving her young son--who wasn't included the first time around--that explains much of her emotional collapse near the end of the movie.  Green is a phenomenal actress who captures Sybilla's many colors in a moving performance.  Jeremy Irons, Edward Norton (haunting in his role as the leperous King Baldwin), David Thewlis, and supporting bad-guys Brendan Gleeson (as Reynald) and Marton Csokas (as the increasingly power mad Guy de Lusignan) all get more screen time, more development and more closure (you actually discover what happens to Guy after he takes that fateful donkey ride)--and all of this contriubutes to the emotional gravity of this visually sweeping film.    Kingdom of Heaven: the Director's cut is the movie Ridely Scott wanted to make, an epic in the true sense of the word: long, bloody, gritty and thematic.  Vast armies charge across alien vistas, banners wave, crosses glitter, catapults topple and men are no more than ants, seen from above, as they struggle atop the walls of Jerusalem.  When one sees what Scott originally intended one can only shake their head in awe at the stupidity of studio execs who cut and truncated his vision into unrecognizeable chop suey.  Restored to full running time, this Kingdom redeems the \\"Gladiator Lite\\" label and hits you in the kidneys with moving characters, heart-pounding violence,and a truly unique take on a historical period known more for its one sided prostletyzing than its moments of grace.  What has always amazed me about this film is that Scott doesn't go for the usual \\"one side good,\\" \\"one side bad\\" dichotomy, but invests his cast of wannabe knights, seasoned warriors, desert kings and unlikely saints with a diverse blend of moral philosophies.  In a period of time known for the evil and cruelty of men, most of Scott's characters seek understanding of their supposed enemies.  Christians and Muslims live side by side in Jerusalem (a little know historical fact, Muslim King Saladin (beautifully potrayed by Gassan Massoud) offers his doctors to an ailing Baldwin and Godfrey strives for a \\"Kingdom of Conscious\\" in the heart of siege.      Orlando Bloom remains a problematic main character, but in a way, his blank slate approach is perfect for a movie with such stong themes of journeying and finding yourself.  Pilgrims in the Crusades often went because they wanted to \\"find themselves\\" along the way--and though you never quite buy Bloom's transformation, he's a charming enough presence that you can let it slide.  (He also makes a great action hero, sweating, grimacing and beating the hell out of enemy knights with alpomp.)    If this cut of Kingdom of Heaven had been released in theaters I believe the reaction to the film would have been more favorable.  This is a compelling movie, full of thrilling battles and gorgeous cinematography--now completed with fully realized emotional gravity and a clarity of ideas.  It is a film that rewards repeated viewings (you can take in niether the physical nor moral scope in one go)and deserves a place not under the shadow of Gladiator, but alongside it as another splendid artistic achievement by one of our most ambitious directors.

B000FZETIO|4.0|Andie Walsh (Molly Ringwald)is a kid from the wrong side of the tracks .She is however self-confident,pretty  and  stylish ,making her own clothes and cajoling her widower father Jack (Harry Dean Stanton)into looking foe work .He is still deep in mourning for his wife's death ,Andie is a good student  and works part time in a record store .She is however having a tough time -the \\"ugly sister\\" types being the well to do female students who pick on her and her friends.She is also the target of the boorish advances of the preening rick kid Steff Mckee (James Spader).Andie is adored by the geeky \\"Duckie\\",more properly known as Phil Dale (Jon Cryer) who is quite willing to announce to her Dad that he wishes to marry her but who never asks here to the prom ,an event avoided by the poorer kids in the school.  Enter rich kid Blaine (Andrew McCarthy ,not as snobbish as the others in his set and who woos Andie, a process not without its ups and downs and which divides him from his friends especially McKee .The theme of money and class runs through this movie very clearly and helps make the movie less sugary than it might otherwise have been .  The performances are good especially from Stanton who brings a welcome touch os astringency to the role .The John Hughes script is fine and Howard Deutch directs expertly aided by a well chosen 80's soundtrack(which I did not like as it is not my musical thing but it does suit the movie well and that is the prime consideration ,surely)    Nice Cinderella themmed movie amd above average for the high school genre
1881273156|5.0|The basic premise of this book -- that people express their love and commitment to one another in different ways, which can easily be misunderstood -- is a most important realization.  It's a simple concept, but to really apply it, to try to view your spouse differently and break-out of over learned patterns, especially in the \\"heat of the moment,\\" takes a concerted effort.  The book is one to read and re-read in staying on-track, whether to replenish or to enhance feelings of commitment and intimacy in your marriage.  I most highly recommend this book.

B0013HE4HE|4.0|What a great album.  I'm not a Goldfrapp fan, wasn't into their earlier stuff.  This album, however, is quite sweet and infectious, in a moody sort of way.  Very delicate with some of the best vocals I've heard anywhere.  The first track, \\"Clowns\\", is quite special.<br /><br />The biggest critique I have of this album is that it is so slow throughout with only a minor uptick in mood and beat toward the end.
1557507473|5.0|I recently read this book for the second time.  As others have noted, this is by far the best American memoir of the Pacific Theater.  While Sledge's narrative style is straightforward and plain, there is a sensitivity to the work that is not found in other American war memoirs.  Sledge was a good Marine, and understood that Japanese brutality had to be answered in kind: he had absolutely no compunction about killing the Japanese and often expresses an extreme hatred towards them.  His descriptions of what he witnessed are often horrific--the picture he paints of \\"Maggot Ridge\\" on Okinawa is nothing short of a hellscape.  And yet a central theme in the book is that in the midst of all the brutality of Peleliu and Okinawa, one had to try to maintain at least a modicum of sensitivity and human compassion.  That, I believe, is what makes this such a remarkable record of the war.<br />I had the privilege of talking to Dr. Sledge about a decade ago, and he was a true gentleman--courteous, kind, and very generous with his time.  Indeed, my overwhelming impression was that he was a very gentle person.  Perhaps that is why his memoir is so haunting.
B0010YSD7M|1.0|I used to love Stargate.  But maybe it was the departure of Richard Dean Anderson, I don't know.  But the last few seasons have been extremely repetitive and tiresome.  Random Ancient artifact saves the day.  The Ark of Truth is no exception.   The only character that gets any decent character development is Tomin when he has a change of heart.   Otherwise it's the same ole tired formula.   1) Find Ancient artifact.  2) magically decipher it despite how ridiculously old and advanced it is. 3) Save the day.  4) Lather rinse repeat.  It was bad enough that the first seasons of Stargate dealt with Humans miraculously defeating an enemy that was vastly more advanced and had been in power for thousands of years.  But my suspension of disbelief simply cannot tolerate simple humans fighting virtual deities and somehow winning.   It is extremely disappointing to see Stargate fall so far.
0810994739|5.0|I read this book to a 5 and 7 year old boy.  They loved it, and got a bunch of laughs out of it.  Reads like a diary.  Addresses the issues of middle school etc.  Bullies, parents, friends, frustrations... nice sense of humor.  Makes you remember the frustrations of youth.
0060575816|4.0|I will just add my praises for Garth Nix's 'Sabriel' the story of a young woman who is thrust into the role of the Abhorsen, who has the dangerous responsibility to put back into Death those spirits (usually malign) who have returned to Life. 'Sabriel' is a very good story, refreshingly different from the rest of the genre. The story moves at a fast pace, and is an easy, but not simple read. I am glad to hear there are sequels, as it seems that there is much yet to discover in the Old Kingdom.
B0009MDPYM|5.0|Fortunately a few years back my son discovered comic books. At least the card sets that were coming out about that time. In so doing, I helped him to find out what was behind all of those cards and found myself immersed once again in the brightly colored world of comics. Except that I soon discovered that comics were no longer a children's art form but a whole other world of graphic storytelling and imagery that was unlike anything out there with the exception of film. Tales of heaven and hell battling it out for the souls of humans, secret government agencies that allowed people to extract revenge on those who had done them wrong and heroes that actually killed people because they felt it was in the interest of society were all present. And so was John Constantine.<br /><br />The comic series HELLBLAZER was the story of John Constantine. And unfortunately I never found myself drawn to it. As written by Garth Ennis, it took on a legendary status among fans and helped to increase the popularity of DC's Vertigo brand, a home for more adult oriented comics like this and SANDMAN. When I heard it was going to be made into a film I was interested. And after watching this film, I may have to take the chance of picking up some of the trade paperback copies of the series.<br /><br />The film opens with John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) being called to a tenement apartment where a young Hispanic girl has been possessed. With the knowledge he possesses, Constantine is able to bring the demon out of the young girl and send it back to Hell. But something was different here. It seemed that the demon was about to enter our realm and leave its own.<br /><br />We are next introduced to a woman who dreams of another leaping to her death from the top of a building. It turns out it wasn't a dream at all and police detective Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) saw the death of her twin sister. Called to the scene, she seeks solace from a priest later hoping that he will allow her sister to be buried in consecrated ground. At that time, her path crosses with Contantine.<br /><br />Constantine is at the same church talking about the gamble between God and the devil which allowed them to put man's own free will at stake. Either side might try and influence the actions of man, but neither was allowed to be on this plane. Someone is trying to break that deal and Constantine wants to find out whom.<br /><br />The one fault of the film is in assuming we know all there is to know about Constantine and his battles here on earth. It is at this point that we finally begin to get a glimpse of what transpired in the past as Constantine and the angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) discuss John's past and his desire to do good in the hopes of changing God's mind into allowing him admittance into Heaven.  More details of this transpire later in the film.<br /><br />Eventually Constantine's and Dodson's paths cross once again and they are led down the road that will help them both discover who was behind not only the death of Dodson's sister but the attempt to enter this mortal plane as well. It's a long path that leads them both, literally, to hell and back, but the journey they take is one filled with danger, fear and a believable story that draws the viewer in.<br /><br />The story itself here makes the film, offering a battle of good and evil on this plane that was formulated in the beginning with God and the devil. No balance of power is discussed, no self righteous name calling is produced, simply the battle that is fought is brought to our doorstep with all the souls on Earth hanging in the balance.<br /><br />The weakest point is Keanu Reeves. While I enjoy his work and think of him as a more accomplished actor than many give him credit for, he seem far too Neoish here. After three MATRIX movies, I see him in black and think of him there once more. He does a good job, as does Weisz, but I still have that mental image of him.<br /><br />The movie is well made with some great CGI effects that startle and frighten. The images of Hell are what one would expect as are the demons. But all are done with quality here.<br /><br />CONSTANTINE may not be the greatest movie ever made. But it is one movie that will entertain while you watch. And it may cause a few conversations to rise concerning God, the devil, Heaven and Hell. What more could you ask for in a movie?hat one would expect as are the demons. But all are done with quality here.     CONSTANTINE may not be the greatest movie ever made. But it is one movie that will entertain while you watch. And it may cause a few conversations to rise concerning God, the devil, Heaven and Hell. What more could you ask for in a movie?

Through her specific experiences, I have been inspired to do more in my own practice. She has a lot of courage and a gift with words.

At times his use of language was confusing and I ended up skimming parts of the book. Not what I typically like to do.
B00005JM02|5.0|Disney and Pixar have come together over the past few years to bring about a revolution in animated motion pictures. While many studios have faltered in their attempts or fallen back on trying to adapt anime as a way to make movies inexpensively, these two studios have taken a different route and joined the art of animation with cartoon storytelling.<br /><br />The movie tells the story of Nemo, the only offspring of two clown fish raised along by his single father Marlin (Albert Brooks). Having lost his wife and hundreds of unhatched eggs to the sea, Marlin has been overprotective of little Nemo. And when Nemo rebels and is captured his first time out to the big ocean, it seems as though all of Marlin's fears were right.<br /><br />Fearful of the ocean himself, Marlin must make a journey to find his son and save him. He heads out to sea not so much boldly and without fear as much as he does out of concern and love for his son.<br /><br />Along the way, Marlin makes many new friends, among them another fish named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) who has short term memory but ends up being a help anyway and Crush, a cool dude sea turtle voiced by the films writer/director Andrew Stanton.<br /><br />Nemo himself finds new friends as well. It appears that he was captured by a snorkeling dentist who intends to present him as a gift to his destructive niece. The other fish in the tank try and help Nemo to escape.<br /><br />Word of Marlin's adventures as he searches for Nemo go so far as to reach Nemo's \\"ears\\". Marveling at the tales of his father's love, Nemo and the tank fish do all they can to escape.  It's not until nearly the end of the picture that you find out if the father and son are reunited or if Nemo becomes just another fish tossed down the toilet bowl.<br /><br />The humor in this film is so on the mark it's fantastic. Not only are there jokes that the kids can laugh at, but there are a few in jokes for parents to get as well. This path seemed to work well for animators in the heyday of cartooning in the 40s and plays well here too.<br /><br />The animation is nothing short of phenomenal. The waves on the surface, the vibrant colors of the fish, all mingle together to form a feast for the eyes.<br /><br />But beneath it all is something much more important. The rest is mere icing on the cake. Because at the heart of this movie is the story of two people, parent and child, who may not see eye to eye on all things. But the deep rooted love of that father for son is enough to make him forge ahead and do all within his power to protest and save the one most important thing in his life. His son.<br /><br />Reports are coming in that this film was the highest box office successes  of the summer it was released and it's easy to see why. It's because it works on all levels and appeals to every viewer out there. It is a movie that is one to watch again and again.plays well here too.     The animation is nothing short of phenomenal.

075640407X|5.0|Books are like wine, each vintage has something different to offer the consumer. This book is sumptuous, sultry and full bodied. The book is slow, a journey of learning and setting aside this world. It's hard to explain what vintage this book is, where it falls on the tongue. The flavor is similar to `Kushiel's Dart' by Carey or The Cycle of Oak, Ash, Yew by Norton.  The action is second to the story being told. With books like this it's not even a story being read, it's more like it unfolds. I feel I lack the words to describe the wonder of this book I have been privileged to read. I'm just really glad I finally did. It's been sitting on my books to read shelf for months.  I am glad I read it a month before book 2 came out, which leaves me less time to wait for it. I have waited 10 years for a sequel and I'm willing to wait again. I'm also really glad that in this case, I don't have to.  'Nuff said.
0452289963|5.0|At first, when beginning to read the book it was a little bit hard to take in... but as I continue to read... it was so enlighten ... so many things that we feel and  don't understand, this book gave reason and resolution to it... I would recommend this book to all that is seeking to get in touch with who you are and what you are able to be.
B0012K1ILW|2.0|I truly am an E. Badu fan but, this album is lacking the quality that her albums typically produce.  I can appreciate her message which is delivered in a very militant fashion with the assistance of tracks that are reminiscent of black exploitation cinema.  She is challenging us to wake up and see what's going on from a political and social stand point.  I hear her message loud and clear on some of the tracks however, she misses the mark vocally.  She never really sings to her audience.  She's kind of standing in the background prompting us to make moves as opposed to standing at the podium delivering the speech which will totally captivate her supporters.      \\"The Cell,\\" and \\"Twinkle,\\" have amazing production content.  As for \\"Master Teacher,\\" the track is a bit too \\"noisy\\" for me.  There are too many sounds going on at once which prohibits full engagement with the song.  My favorites are \\"Me\\" which is one of her most personable songs on the CD, and \\"Telephone\\" which is a tribute to J Dilla, one of our Hip-Hop soldiers lost in early 2006.       I have tried so hard to like this CD but to no avail.  I AM happy to add it to my collection because of my appreciation for E. Badu but, I will not be willing to force myself to listen to this CD on a regular basis.
B0002XVQNU|4.0|Marvel comics has launched an assault on moviegoers with a line up of films that are about to undue the bar set by DC comics' BATMAN and SUPERMAN. The success of SPIDERMAN set about a bidding war that resulted in several of their titles being picked up and work is in progress on a number, including IRON FIST and THE PUNISHER. But before those two ever hit the screen, anther title made its way and did well- DAREDEVIL.<br /><br />Ben Affleck stars as Matt Murdock, a blind lawyer who has abilities that offer him more sight than any other mere mortal. As a youngster, Matt was injured in a freak accident that left him blinded. But the chemicals that robbed him of his sight also gave him greater gifts, a sharper sense of hearing and a sort of radar sense.<br /><br />When his father, a boxer who refused to throw a fight and lose in front of his son, is murdered, Matt dedicates himself to fighting for justice. Developing his senses, his mind and his body, Matt becomes a lawyer who defends those without hope. And at night, he becomes Daredevil, donning a red leather costume and disguise as he tracks down those who evaded justice by twisting the law.<br /><br />In his daytime guise, Matt meets and falls for a woman named Elektra (Jennifer Garner), the daughter of a wealthy man who is a cohort of the infamous Wilson Fisk ( ), an underworld leader known as the Kingpin. It is the Kingpin who has been moving into the neighborhood Daredevil protects, the Hell's Kitchen area of New York, Matt's childhood home.<br /><br />When Elektra's father is murdered by Kingpin's assassin Bullseye (Colin Ferrell), the hit is made to appear as if it was done by Daredevil. Trained in numerous martial arts herself, Elektra sets out on a course for revenge against Daredevil, never realizing who he is or how innocent he might be. And while she pursues him, Bullseye sets his sights on her.<br /><br />More story involving Kingpin and Daredevil in one rivalry and Bullseye and Daredevil in another keep the plot going and offer a chance to find out the character motivations of the man beneath the mask.<br /><br />Filled with religious icons aplenty and morals not often found in most stories today, DAREDEVIL offers plenty of action but with something solid beneath it all. Affleck does a great job in the lead role, offering a caring daytime persona and a fear influencing sight to see at night. Garner is superb while looking the part of the object of Matt's infatuation one minute and the avenging angel of death the next. The standout performance here though is Ferrell as Bullseye, a maniac from top to bottom with a wry sense of humor that will have you laughing while being glad he doesn't really exist at the same time.<br /><br />Perhaps the most important aspect of this film, at least for comic fans, is the fact that this movie looks exactly like a comic book come to life. The images seen are sometimes used from the actual comic, including some created by Frank Miller and Joe Quesada in their runs as artists on the book. Daredevil standing atop a church, arms around a cross in the dark of night are both eerie and offering a glimpse of the motivations of the man without fear.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fun movie, dark and light, filled with story as well as action, then you'd be hard pressed to find one more filled with both than this one.<br /><br />A large number of fans and critics alike pounded on this movie when it was released.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a really good workout.  It's geared a little more to advanced exercisers, but the choreography is fairly basic and you will definately feel this the next day.  There are three workouts that combine toning and aerobics together which are about a half an hour each.  This way, you're burning fat and toning muscles at the same time.  It's a little challenging, but fun and effective.  The first workout is the easiest of the three and from there it gets more challenging.  The most challenging workout is tough like she shows on The Biggest Loser (ie travelling pushups and tough jumps etc).  It's a good idea if you're intermediate to begin either at the start or middle and stick to that for a while and then move on.  Each workout uses toning, kickboxing and ab work.    I found this really good to do.  It's absolutely a good idea to not go too quickly with it and begin at the lower of the three levels even if you do it only a couple of times - you can always advance as soon as you're ready for your next workout.  She may not be the best cuer, but she is certainly encouraging and motivating.  This is fun and I highly recommend it.  I've only done it twice so far since it's so new, but I can still feel my muscles thanking me.  This is great.
B00005JNJV|5.0|I've loved almost every Batman movie that's come down the pike. Being a fan of the comic for years, having grown up with it and the camp TV series, watching it change, reinvesting in it when my son was old enough, I've seen the caped crusader in all his incarnations. But the last two films twisted what started as an interesting concept and directed them back towards camp and not in the best way possible. This films makes up for all of that.<br /><br />The film opens with Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in a prison in some Asian country. Fighting among the prisoners with a sort of jubilation, Wayne is visited by a mysterious man (Liam Neeson) who discusses with him the where's, why's and how's of what led him here. They discuss his need for revenge. And then he offers him a chance to find the answers that he seeks, if he will complete the simple task of bringing a flower to the highest point in what appears to be a mountain monastery.<br /><br />Wayne follows this course and becomes a disciple of a man named Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe), the leader of a select group of ninja warriors trained to root out evil. With Neeson as his instructor, Bruce begins to hone his natural born skills. But when push comes to shove and he is required to kill someone, he revolts, strikes out against his masters and torches the building in the process. But before he does so, he rescues Neeson.<br /><br />Returning home to Wayne Manor in Gotham, Bruce sets out to rebuild his life and confront his demons. In the process he makes plans to save Gotham from the downhill slide it has taken since his departure. In discussing it with his long time friend and butler Alfred (Michael Caine) he realizes he must do so from a position of secrecy.<br /><br />Throughout all of this we are given glimpses into the past of young Bruce, from the time he fell into an abandoned well that was filled with bats and caused him his deepest darkest fear to the day that his mother and father were cold bloodedly shot in an alley after he asked them to leave the opera they were attending. All of these things have left emotional scars upon young Bruce. And all of them will help to develop the man, the legend that he will soon become.<br /><br />As Bruce returns to life in Gotham he is reacquainted with the girl he grew up with, Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes). Now a member of the district attorney's office, she remembers the Bruce she knew long ago. She struggles with the world that Gotham has become and regrets the fact that Bruce is not the man about town playboy socialite only concerned with the next party instead of the great city his father helped build. She is completely unaware of the man that Bruce truly is and the plans that he has.<br /><br />As Bruce considers his options, he also has to take back control of the company his family helped build. Now run by Erle (Rutger Hauer), it is about to lapse into open the open market since Bruce was thought dead. And may yet do so.<br /><br />All of this progresses without an ounce of boredom for the viewer. The thing that separates this film from the rest is the amount of rich storytelling involved. The plotlines weave in and out of each other as the motivations and backdrop for this hero become evident.<br /><br />While he adjusts to Gotham and the false lifestyle he must portray, Bruce also makes the acquaintance of a member of the family business, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). Directed this way by Alfred, Lucius now spends his days in the basement areas of the Wayne building harboring the creations he has come up with over the past years. Everything from body armor to grappling hooks to transportation is there. Upon seeing these items, Bruce knows just the way to put them to use.<br /><br />Going back to the long lost bat cave he visited as a child, Bruce turns it into a secret lair where he creates a costume and then goes forth to fight evil doers. Yeah it sounds hokey but isn't that what Batman did? And along the way he confronts a new evil, one that intends to turn Gotham into a town brought down by madness.<br /><br />Gangster Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) has aligned himself with a psychiatrist named Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy) and a benefactor unknown. Crane has developed a highly toxic hallucinogen that transforms those infected with total fear and madness. Upon infecting someone with the drug, Crane puts on a mask and becomes the evil Scarecrow, inducing nightmares beyond belief.<br /><br />A face off between these three is inevitable and as Bruce aka Batman grows accustomed to his new persona, more comfortable in it, the chances of his survival increase. Along with one single policeman he trusts, James Gordon (Gary Oldman), Batman sets out to stop the plan that has been put in motion. But even he has no idea who the real foe he is confronting is. And the revelation of that is a surprise not only for him but for viewers as well.<br /><br />The movie does two things with ease. It makes the story of Batman just that, a story rather than a framework with which to place characters and toy designs around. It fills it out like it has never been done before and makes you think it all plausible, if not possible.<br /><br />The other thing it does is offer a movie that is filled with action and romance and adventure and it does so in spades. This is a fun movie that kids, perhaps not too young, can enjoy as well as grandma who may remember the old sixties show.<br /><br />The movie features excellent acting all round with no one person taking the full credit. Each and every actor stands out. The special effects are eye dazzling and they compliment the character and story rather than become the main feature.<br /><br />This film opened big at the box office and deservedly so.

B000FL7CAK|5.0|This show just gets better and better. The writing is amazing and the whole cast from top to bottom are really talented. This isn't just a typical teen show by any means. There is more going on in one episode of Veronica Mars than most shows have in five. The bus crash mystery unravels all season long and there are plenty of other \\"mysteries of the week\\" to keep everything interesting. Too bad the show only lasted three seasons, but at least it got that long.
B0001L3LUE|4.0|Director Errol Morris is noted for the numerous documentaries he has made over the years. Well researched and made with an objective viewpoint, he does what a true documentary film maker does. He assembles previous footage, shoots his own footage, conducts interviews and assembles it all to tell a story. Sometimes, as in the case of THE THIN BLUE LINE, he tries to make the viewer see the truth in what his film is about. But more to the point, he does this without setting someone up or trying to make someone look bad, without ridiculing someone in an attempt to make a point. Because of this, Morris deserved the recognition he received this past year as FOG OF WAR went home with the best documentary prize at the Oscars.<br /><br />The film is a look back at Robert McNamara, past Secretary of Defense under both Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. Some background about his life is offered, his family, his schooling and such, but for the most part, Morris wants to focus on his time under these two presidents and their involvement in the Vietnam War. Morris never attacks McNamara nor presents him as the cause of the way and our involvement in it. Instead, he presents a man who sincerely wanted out and whose advice was ignored.<br /><br />The film is told in chapters, its title letting you know that at the beginning since the full title is FOG OF WAR: ELEVEN LESSONS FROM THE LIFE OF ROBERT S. McNAMARA. Each chapter moves in a progression as McNamara tells of the events in his life that formed him, from his time in the military during WW II through his recent past. The lessons that he has learned and tries to somewhat impart here are ones that everyone should follow, especially those in power.<br /><br />McNamara was there during the missiles of October event, when we stared straight into the eye of the Russians and Cubans and said we were ready to go to war if need be. But his insight into this situation here is fascinating, helping the viewer to realize just exactly how close we came to all out nuclear war. And in his manner of presenting this fact, McNamara lets us know that he felt we would never have completely recovered from such a devastating event.<br /><br />A majority of the film focuses on Vietnam. Recently released White House tapes made by both presidents are included here as we get a behind the scene glimpse of how the office works. While Kennedy values his advice and counsel, Johnson seemed to have taken him on only due to his being there when he took office. The fact that both men respected McNamara is evident as is McNamara's regret of having not removed America from Vietnam sooner.<br /><br />Morris is a fantastic film maker, always letting the subject of his films speak out rather than forcing them to do so. His combination of archival footage with current interviews, his use of music and editing techniques have always made him a force to be reckoned with in the field. But it is his choice to give the viewer a glimpse into those subjects unfiltered that makes his films more real than those of any documentary film maker today.<br /><br />While this film may not seem entertaining to most it is enlightening and informative. You walk away having a newfound respect for McNamara. And if you don't recall or remember the name, you find yourself wanting to discover more about him. And isn't that the objective of a documentary film maker? To draw the viewer into wanting to know more? Morris does that with ease. Let's hope he continues to do so.ear war.

B0002F6BRE|5.0|If you are anything like I am, then you are a sap for almost any sentimental movie that comes out around Christmas time. This may have been caused by too many viewings of RUDPOLPH on television or the fact that the first time I ever saw IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE I was fortunate enough to watch it in the company of creator/director Frank Capra. In any event, put enough sentiment into a movie and I am gone.<br /><br />That being said, this movie isn't overwrought with sentiment but it does have its share. More than sap, it offers us a truly funny movie that doesn't rely on the most total of gross jokes to make you laugh (although a well placed burp does occur). Instead, it offers us the naïve charm of a character that is so innocent that every move he makes becomes touching and funny at the same time.<br /><br />Will Ferrell of SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE fame stars as Buddy. When a baby in an orphanage, Buddy crawled into Santa's sack and was taken to the North Pole. There he was adopted by a kindly elf (Bob Newhart) and raised until he was about 30 when he discovered he was a human and not an elf. Like I said, Buddy is quite naïve throughout.<br />Learning his true lot in life, Buddy heads for New York to find his real father, a man Santa tells him is on the naughty list.<br /><br />Buddy's father Walter is played by James Caan. Walter is a publisher of children's books who is looking for a hit. He's also one of those workaholics that have no time for anything from the holiday to his own family. Needless to say when Buddy arrives rather than welcome him with open arms, he sends him away and refuses to believe.<br /><br />Buddy finds work (and a love interest) at Gimbels in the Christmas department naturally. A tussle with a store Santa (you see Buddy KNOWS he's not the real one) and he loses his job. But not before Walter takes him to his doctor to discover that yes, Buddy IS his real son.<br /><br />Moving in with the family, Buddy is filled with Christmas cheer non stop. He decorates the apartment, he eats everything with syrup on it and he becomes friends with Walter's other son Michael (Daniel Tay). It is through watching and being exposed to Buddy that several of the characters change by the films end.<br /><br />But before that happens, a destitute Buddy watches as Santa's sleigh falls from the sky into Central Park. The magic that kept the sleigh soaring in the past was Christmas spirit which has been lacking lately. An engine was put on by Buddy's adoptive father to help Santa along. But the engine has fallen off and only Buddy can replace it and help Santa. But can he do so before the park police catch them? Or will there be a way that the spirit of Christmas will rise again, enough to get the sleigh running once more?<br /><br />This movie is filled with simple jokes that are funny, mostly visuals that lose something in the translation when described (for instance Buddy's joy in running around in a revolving door...see? Not funny to read but funny to watch). Ferrell is fantastic, providing the right about of simple mindedness to Buddy but at the same time offering that hopeful attitude that most of us have lost along the way.<br /><br />Caan does a great job too as the frustrated father who never knew about Buddy but is struggling to not only come to terms with that but his whole life as well. Mary Steenburgen adds just the right support in her role as Caan's wife. Zooey Deschanel is a bright star as the object of Buddy's affection (with a fantastic singing voice as well). And stand out but used only for a brief moment is Peter Dinklage as Miles Finch, a high priced creative genius in the world of children's lit who buddy mistakes for an elf (Dinklage is actually a dwarf).<br /><br />The movie offers some hilarious moments and some touching ones as well. And it also takes a moment to remind us all of the real spirit of Christmas. The joy of giving and not just waiting to see who got you something. It makes you realize that this is a special time of the year. And above all else, it makes you feel one of the simplest things at this time of year. Warm and fuzzy. Don't miss this one.<br /><br />Oh yes, one more thing. If you too grew up with RUDOLPH you'll love the stop motion credits and characters at the North Pole who seem slightly familiar. Created by the Chiodo brothers (of CRITTERS and KILLER KLOWNS fame) it is a tremendous tribute to the classic Rankin/Bass creations.e of the simplest things at this time of year. Warm and fuzzy.

B0002IQNAG|5.0|DAWN OF THE DEAD is a classic horror film although only a short time has passed since it was released. With a remake in the works it's important to go back and take a look at the original. And it's a horror film that loses nothing with time.<br /><br />The story picks up where the original left off, a world where flesh eating zombies are roaming the countryside in search of fresh kill. This plague, which is never explained as to how it began, has multiplied and now the ratio of zombies to live humans is about equal.<br /><br />Enter a pair of S.W.A.T. members (Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger) who have tired of hunting down these zombies. Reiniger plans on escaping the city with a friend and his girlfriend (David Emgee and Gaylen Ross), a pilot and a producer for the local TV station.<br />They four set off to find a safe haven and discover a world gone mad along the way, with order destroyed and hunting parties roaming the countryside.<br /><br />As they fly, they come across an abandoned mall and land on the roof. Noticing the obvious pluses of taking the mall over, blocking the entranceways and staying put, they make their play. But taking out a mall filled with these creatures is not an easy task.<br /><br />Blocking the doors with trucks from a nearby freight company and then dispensing of the zombies within, the four find it a home away from home. One casualty in their conquest leaves the other three enjoying the spoils of war and soon finding themselves bored.<br /><br />The three reinvigorate their will to live, as Ross learns to fly the helicopter and they monitor the radio in the hopes that there are other survivors. When a call comes in they almost invite the callers, but then discover that it's only a band of marauding bikers on the move, raiding any and everything in their path. A battle ensues in which not only the bikers but the zombies reinvade the mall as well.<br /><br />What has been most talked about with this film is the fact that it is more than a straight on piece of gore filled horror. Director George Romero has used the mall and the creatures as a metaphor for the mindless zombie like shoppers seen everywhere in this country, evident in today's malls as much as it was in 1978 when this film was made.  Go to any mall in the land today and walk around looking at the shoppers after seeing this flick and you will be sure to see one or more characters come to life before your eyes.<br /><br />While a horror movie doesn't have to rely on gore, this movie was one of the first to utilize it, garnering it an X rating had it actually been submitted. Relegated to midnight showing across the country and no newspaper advertising, it still gathered a cult following that included the likes of Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel.<br /><br />The movie takes the day to day spots that we all go to each week and turns them into the most horrific of locations. With this in mind, we are put upon not in a castle or haunted house, but a shopping center that contains all that we feel we need or want. It is a well lit and mundane location, a spot where we are offered muzak and water fountains, only to have it tainted by the horrors of these creatures.<br />We are taken into a world filled with fear of the unknown, of a future that may not exist. And we are given a chance to look at ourselves in a different light. And at the same time, we scared to death by both what we may be and by what may happen.r George Romero has used the mall and the creatures as a metaphor for the mindless zombie like shoppers seen everywhere in this country, evident in today's malls as much as it was in 1978 when this film was made.  Go to any mall in the land today and walk around looking at the shoppers after seeing this flick and you will be sure to see one or more characters come to life before your eyes.    While a horror movie doesn't have to rely on gore, this movie was one of the first to utilize it, garnering it an X rating had it actually been submitted. Relegated to midnight showing across the country and no newspaper advertising, it still gathered a cult following that included the likes of Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel.    The movie takes the day to day spots that we all go to each week and turns them into the most horrific of locations. With this in mind, we are put upon not in a castle or haunted house, but a shopping center that contains all that we feel we need or want. It is a well lit and mundane location, a spot where we are offered muzak and water fountains, only to have it tainted by the horrors of these creatures.  We are taken into a world filled with fear of the unknown, of a future that may not exist. And we are given a chance to look at ourselves in a different light. And at the same time, we scared to death by both what we may be and by what may happen.

But it end well and this last season has shown that the girls have grown a lot since the beginning of the show. But they still fun and witty. Gilmore Girls rockss!!!
B0001MDP3G|3.0|The novel COLD MOUNTAIN was one that took the world by surprise. Not a book that some thought would find an audience, it became a hit and spawned this film as well. And it is one of the most romantic, although brutal, films to come along in some time.<br /><br />The story takes place at the beginning of and throughout the years of the Civil War, Young Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) has moved to the town of Cold Mountain with her minister father (Donald Sutherland). There, she meets and falls in love with a quiet man named Inman (Jude Law) and we are off and running on a rocky romance.<br /><br />The couple never has the time to court as most do when word of war erupts and changes their world forever. Inman sets out to fight and not until the last moment before leaving do the two have the chance to let each other know that there is more going on here than just minor attraction. Inman heads out with the knowledge that Ada will wait for him until his return.<br /><br />It is these words, along with a book she gave him and the three letters he receives that keep Inman going. Through the killing and battles around him, including that of Petersburg. Inman sees the folly of war and the loss of those around him. Wounded in battle, he is sent to a hospital to recover. Changed by all he has witnessed, Inman deserts and heads home for Cold Mountain and the woman he loves.<br /><br />While this is going on, we are brought into the story of Ada as well. Her father passes away and she begins to lose hope. Unable and unknowledgeable in the day to day means of living, she depends on others to help her. One sends along Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellwegger), a self sufficient up front young woman to help. Not only does Ada begin to change in what she learns and how she deals with the world, Ruby offers a character with more depth than is revealed on the surface.<br /><br />The ladies resurrect the farm and Ada's way of life. All of this takes place under the watchful eye of Teague (Ray Winstone), a ruffian who once owned the land Ada now possesses and who wants it back. Teague and his men are now the law of Cold Mountain, placed in charge of hunting down deserters first and foremost.<br /><br />The movie follows two separate paths, one the literal one of Inman as he travels and meets all sorts of people from a randy minister (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) to a young woman (Natalie Portman) with a child whose husband was killed in the war. Each episode of what Inman is witness to brings images to mind of the Civil War that many are not familiar with.<br /><br />Ada, on the other hand, makes her own journey, trading in the somewhat pampered life she had led before as a young woman for the world of a woman who must tend to learning how to live life on her own should it come to that. With no men and slaves now a thing of the past, only Ada with the help of Ruby can survive.<br /><br />Along the side is the story of Ruby who deals with her past, including her father (Brendan Gleeson) who left her to fight. He returns with a two friends and they are welcomed back, though not quite with open arms. And now that they are deserters as is Inman, the shadow of Teague must eventually fall into place.<br /><br />The paths that these lives take is one that moves slow at first, but builds to an ending that is both romantic and tragic at the same time. It seems that all literary romances end in some sort of tragedy (thing back to TITANIC, a movie that I felt contained nothing of the heart that this one does). And this tale does so as well, though where that tragedy comes from I won't share here. Instead, watch the film, keep a box of Kleenex handy and enjoy a story of America's past. And while anti-war to an extent, it does not do so with a holier than thou attitude. The actions and images seen say it all.Ada now possesses and who wants it back.

B000ERU9S2|4.0|Ronin is not your typical CIA spy movie ala James Bond, it's actually realistic.  Maybe that's what hurt this movie with some reviewers and at the box office.  What we get with Ronin is a serious spy/action movie of that genre that brings together a ragtag group of mercenaries who are hired to retrieve a briefcase at any cost.  What's inside the briefcase?  Well, we never know.  But who cares, really?  It's not about that really.  It's about the suspense, espionage, and double-crossing this movie brings to life in the streets of France.  This is probably how hired contracts are actually drawn up and executed in the real world.  When a superpower wants a piece of information, this is how they go about getting it.  But who can you trust?  Absolutely no one.<br /><br />What steals the show in this movie more than the overall plot, is by far the car chase scenes on the streets of France.  I believe Ronin to have the best car chase scene to date.  I haven't seen one to come close yet.  Obviously the streets have been closed off and the cars are driven by stunt drivers, but you will be at the edge of your seat at a car chase that comes pretty close to 10 minutes in length.  How these guys managed to pull it off is amazing.  Kudos to those stuntmen. Hair-pinning turns at disastrous speeds absolutely draw you into the action.  While some of the acting may lack just that, you have to remember that real-life mercs are probably just like that.  Stoic, secret, and plain.  That's how they get the job done.  Overall an excellent thriller of a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  De Niro is top notch as well.  He can sell any role.  4 stars
B00005JNEW|4.0|I've never been a big fan of sports but I have enjoyed far too many sports films. Some of them I came across quite by accident or due to friend's recommendations. Others I had to see because of where I lived (HOOSIERS was directed by local resident transplanted to LA David Anspaugh). The fact is that while I never enjoyed the sports so much, I always appreciated what it was that was going on. And the movies made about sports have for the most part always turned out well.<br /><br />But this movie takes things one step further than most. It gets to the heart of the game as well as the downside without using the usual contrivances of most films. Some may appear to be those, but upon closer examination you can find the differences. The big game, the problematic team member, the tough as nails coach. All are here but not quite like you may have seen them before.<br /><br />Billy Bob Thornton stars as coach Gary Gaines, the coach of the Permian High Panthers from Odessa, TX. The town of Odessa worships the ground that their players walk on. Why? Because there is nothing or little else to do or find in Odessa.<br /><br />This year the team has the chance to make it all the way, to be the state champs. And all hopes are residing on the shoulders of one player, Boobie Miles (Derek Luke), a player who is not only filled with talent but with an ego to match. The team rallies behind Boobie and knows that they are going to win. That is until an injury sidelines Boobie...for good.<br /><br />Now if the team is to make it, they must work together and work hard to get there. The battle is not one won by an individual, but won by the team. And each and every one works in their own way to get there.<br /><br />The film offers us glimpses into the lives of the players, but none to the extent that the story becomes each individual's. Instead, it shows their trial and tribulation but keeps coming back to the team and the efforts they make to become winners. Rather than become absorbed in the off the field dramas of each, the film focuses on what goes on ON the field. It is perhaps the best shot look at football on the field that I have seen.  It draws you in and places you on the field with the team, rooting for them all the way.<br /><br />You feel it all in this film. The pressures to perform coming from coach and community, the need to win, the desire to be their best, the confusion of becoming a \\"star\\" in the local school and community that is passed on to these gridiron heroes. And right smack in the middle of it all is the heart that beats loud and clear, the heart that shows these youngsters were there not for the fame and glory but because they felt the need within themselves to be their best.<br /><br />The film is based on the best seller by author H.G.Bissinger and based on the true story. While I am certain an amount of liberties were taken with this book, the soul is very much seen on film. One great extra on the DVD is the inclusion of a look at the players as they are today. The question of what happened to Boobie Miles after his misfortune is answered as are what became of the other teammates involved. The movie is part touching, part sports like violence and part examination of what goes on in the lives of teen sports heroes. But above all else, it is a movie that draws you in and holds you tight until the clock ticks down the final seconds of the game.the film focuses on what goes on ON the field.

B000UGG39Q|4.0|While not the 1995 masterpiece that was Down's first album, Down III - Over the Under certainly takes off into a new direction for the members of Down.  This is a more soulful effort by the band with songs that are directly from the heart.  You can feel it in the music and by listening to the lyrics, this was an album that was raw emotion.  Phil's lyrics come from the heart regarding recent events from the death of Dime to Katrina, it's not an album about anger, but perspective and where to take it from here.  The music sounds a lot more clearer than that of Down II.  A difference you'll notice right off the bat.  Also, Phil explores his softer side and strays away from a lot of his past stuff and really delivers a rich soulful performance on each song.  Personally, a solid effort in production that I personally rank better than the previous Down  album, but nowhere near as perfect as the first.
B00005JM4Z|3.0|Fans of the first film, THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS, may have felt that what it offered was nothing more than a career boost to co-star Vin Diesel. The fact is that it was a fun filled roller coaster ride that film goers flocked to. Hollywood, never one to not notice something like this, did what had to be done. They made this sequel.<br /><br />Now sequels are never looked upon very well by most critics. It is the rare occasion when they find any praise whatsoever. And as they go, this movie isn't quite as good as the original. But it still retains the fun and entertainment level of the first, sacrificing only a fraction of the serious undertones seen there.<br /><br />Having aided a felon escape at the end of the first film, officer Brain O'Connor (Paul Walker) is now on the run. Taking his tricked out car and heading down the road, he makes his way across the USA towards Miami. Using his driving ability, he picks up cash along the way as well as when he hits the south Florida streets. A bust after an illegal street race (using state of the art technology that shuts down a cars electric system), Brian is offered a chance to avoid jail time AND have his record wiped clean.<br /><br />All he has to do is go undercover again and find out how drug runner Carter Verone (Cole Hauser) is laundering the money he makes. With an agent already in deep cover, they assign a newbie to Brian. Demonstrating how inept he is, Brian insists on recruiting his own backup.<br /><br />Change of location to Barstow where an old friend of Brian's is racing. Roman Pearce (Tyrese) holds a grudge against Brian for not helping him after Brian became a police man. But being offered the chance to have his record cleared and removed from house arrest, he jumps at the opportunity.<br /><br />The pair has a chance to prove themselves right away as Verone sets up a contest for drivers to return with a package. The high speed race is on and of course, the dynamic duo wins. Now working for Verone, they are given a job to transport a package (the money) for him. Problems involving Verone's trust of his close personal assistant who also happens to be the deep undercover agent (Eva Mendes) results in a set up for Brian and Roman. Combine that with a stereotypical overzealous FBI agent (James Remar) and you have a predictable yet fun movie.<br /><br />The charm of this movie is not the in depth look at social problems facing today's youth gone wild that results in their fascination in hot looking cars and illegal street races. Leave that for another film, perhaps a documentary. No, the charm of this film lies in two things. The actors and the cars.<br /><br />Walker and Tyrese fit well together, making their friendship believable. The ease with which they slide into their characters is fast and fun and filled with plenty of humor as well. The sign of a good actor is one who makes it appear as if he is not acting. And both of them do that well here.<br /><br />The cars? What can I say? These are some of the most ticked out vehicles on the planet. Filled with everything from televisions to computer assists to neon and chrome, each one is almost a character in itself. They look wicked and hot and lethal all at once.<br /><br />A few side stories involving friends and more street races fill out the basic plot of the movie. But everything continues to focus on the cars and the leads. And in the end that's all that matters. This is not a heavy duty drama. This is a popcorn flick, pure and simple. And as far as that goes, it fills bucket after bucket.(the money) for him.

B000TFINY6|4.0|LOST is possibly one of the greatest shows of all times. The hi-def, widescreen jungle, mountain and ocean scenes are incredible in Blu-Ray.    The only drawback is that like many Blu-Ray DVDs, it is painfully slow to start up. And to make matters worse, LOST is one of those poorly-designed DVDs which will not start up at the same spot after it shuts down.    Say that you put it on Pause and go to answer the phone. After a couple of minutes, the DVD player shuts down and you have to go through the painfully slow start-up again and scroll around to find where you paused. There is no excuse for producing a DVD this way, as far as I know. Other DVDs will restart from where they were stopped/paused, and some even have their own system for marking where they were stopped.    The solution I use is to Pause, but then start it in slow-motion at 1/8 speed. This keeps it from cutting off, then when I get back, I can easily rewind to where I was.    I hope LOST Season 4 comes out in B-R, but that it fixes this problem.
B000TX7B5U|4.0|To me this album is at the same time enjoyable and saddening. If you used to like SOAD alot then you will probably like this album too, the melodies are catchy and the voice is awesome as always. But... where are the guitars ? Those powerful guitar attacks, those incredible guitar riffs which used to become each time stronger and more original throughout their whole discography... where are they gone ? Same question for the drums. Where is what made SOAD's sound \\"unique\\" ? Here the whole instrumentation sounds like every average pop/rock album of those years. Not that it sounds bad, but something is terribly missing if you compare it to what SOAD used to be.    If this album is still without any doubt the genius of one man, then SOAD was definitely the genius of several men and therefore unfortunately cant be reached anymore.    System Of A Down, I miss you.
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|As a student of the sociological field, this movie is a plethora of excellence!  It explores various avenues of social class and instability and shows truly how a person can overcome these instances.  The best thing about this film is that it is set in the future yet, it feels like it is happening today.  Michael Nyman, the composer of the score, does an excellent job in setting the mood.  This is my absolute favorite film...I suggest getting the Cambridge Guide to the movie if you would really like to dissect some of the deeper themes within it.
0143038419|2.0|This book was very fun to read when the author was in Italy.  Her character really began to develop and the way she wrote made you care about her failing marriage and her depression.  However, when she gets to India, the book loses momentum (halfway in book). I just think there is so much more she could have done with showing the difference in lifestyle and culture from being in Italy to going to an ashram.  Once she gets to Indonesia, it isn't very clear exactly what her purpose is (although it is supposed to be to let go and have the wild love affair with the Brazilian guy).  I didn't feel connected to her character anymore and frankly, I couldn't wait for the book to end and found myself wanting to stop reading it toward the last few pages.  I left it on the plane for someone else.[[ASIN:097952640X Integrative Nutrition]]
B000O178BY|5.0|All hail Trent Reznor.  \\"Year Zero\\" starts off with the instrumental \\"Hyperpower!\\", and from the first couple of seconds I could tell what kind of album this was going to be.  I feel that social commentary works best when it is sarcastic, sincere, and not too preachy, which is why this album works.  It is a grandiose statement about where our country and world could be heading in the future, but the feel of it is most cetainly rooted in our everyday lives RIGHT NOW.  \\"Survivalism\\" and \\"Capital G\\" are specifically aimed at the Establishment (Bush Administration?).  \\"The Good Soldier\\" tells the story of a war-weary soldier who questions his actions and duties (Iraq and Afghanistan?).  \\"God Given\\" is a ditty about religious belief and class superiority (American/Middle Eastern differences and the American Public itself?)  \\"The Great Destroyer\\" is the frightening turning point of the album where a military leader foresees his/her personal regret in dropping \\"The Big One\\", yet does it anyway.  The final three songs on the album bring the story to a bitter but appropriate end.  \\"In This Twilight\\" and especially \\"Zero Sum\\" are amazingly heartfelt songs where the narrator looks back on the destruction of the world and wonders just where it all went wrong, and wishes that they can do it again and make different choices.  They realize how it all came to this, and come to the conclusion that it was \\"brought on by our own hand\\".  A wonderful end to a wonderful album.  I feel that pessimistic outlooks on the future come to be because of our flawed civilization.  Some have accused the album of sounding too \\"computerized\\".  The justification for this is very simple: the story takes place in the future.  I hope that our world is not heading in this direction, but I sure do hope our music is.
B0002V7ODI|5.0|In 1944, the Nazis and German scientists with the aid of legendary Russian mystic Grigori Rasputin (Karel Roden) are conducting experiments in black magic. They have created a special dimensional portal machine that can summon a powerful demon god from another dimension to bring armageddon to the world but it failed. Paranormalist Professor Trevor Broom Brutterholm (John Hurt) and a band of soldiers discover a harmless baby devil-like demon with short non-sharp horns from hell as they raise him to be an avenging creature that defends people and destroys evil nicknamed Hellboy (Ron Perlman). Sixty years later, Rasputin has been resurrection as now he joins forces with zombie-like nazi soldier Kroenen (Ladislav Beran) and sexy Illsa (Biddy Hodson) as they must attempt to try to bring the demon god to create the apocalypse. Now it's up to Professor Broom's Beauru for Paranormal Research squad lead by Hellboy with the help of kind hearted, intelligent and telepathic merman named Abe Sapien (Voiced by David Hyde Pierce and played by Doug Jones) and gorgeous pyrokinetic woman Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) as they face off some deadly demons and try to save the world.<br /><br />Superb horror comedy fantasy adventure from the brilliant Mexican director Guillermo Del Toro (\\"Blade II\\", \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\" and \\"Cronos\\") and based on the popular cult Dark Horse comic \\"Hellboy\\" by Mike Mignola who was one of the producers of this movie. It's faithfully adapts the brilliant comic book to life thanks to the director's vision, Ron Perlman was born to play the title hero and just fits the bill the right way! Hellboy's make-up was created by Rick Baker (\\"An American Werewolf in London\\") and the creature effects especially on Abe Sapien are fantastic. The film co-stars Jeffrey Tambor, Rupert Evans and Brian Steele as the entire cast gives out wonderful performances and there's good action sequences. I love how the film has a mix of fantasy with H.P. Lovecraft-esque themes to it and of course some good timed humor mixed in, this is one of the greatest comic book movies in recent memory and a true must see! i can't wait for the sequel this summer.<br /><br />This 3-Disc DVD contains the unrated director's cut with never before seen footage not shown in the theatrical cut with hours of awesome extras.

B000YXMMAE|2.0|I'm sorry,  but I must be one of the only people on the planet that feels that Radiohead is overrated.  Due to the fact that Radiohead has such a devoted following, I'm sure some people reading this have already begun to load their shotguns and sharpen their knives because of the statement I just made.  The music is not garbage, but I wouldn't really consider it rock music, either.  Most of the songs on this album seem like Thom Yorke solo songs.  I know that there are subtle nuances in every instrument, and blah, blah, blah, but I feel that most of the time the other band members are just sitting there and waiting to do their part to serve the song while Yorke whines like a young boy in timeout.  Seriously, I give him credit for his lyrics, but his voice is annoying and always sounds the same.  To me, a great rock and roll singer is someone that conveys earnest emotion through their voice (which Yorke does relatively well) and plays with their vocal range and peaks based on the mood of the song they are singing.  In other words, someone with versatility in their voice, and Yorke just doesn't seem to have it.  Most of the songs sound the same.  I thought \\"Reckoner\\" and \\"Bodysnatchers\\" were great songs, but they don't carry the album as a whole.  I'd like to see what the other band members are capable of instead of standing in the shadow of an egocentric lead singer.
0440419514|5.0|After seeing the movie for 'The Golden Compass' I was expecting that the book would be better and that the whole series would play as just another alternative to 'Lord of the Rings' (as the movie did).  I was absolutely shocked by how MUCH better the book was than the movie, and was completely riveted through books two and three.      What I find most amazing is that the author reveals everything in such a slow and meticulous way that you are still learning new elements of the world and of the story right up to the end - every page you read could contain an amazing shift of direction.  I *never* expected this story to take me where it did, and my only regret is that it all had to end.    This is not just a book for young adults, either.  In my mid thirties, I found pleanty in this book worth being excited about.
B0001XALTG|5.0|Trainspotting is in some regards a masterpiece of film making. The portrayal of the deadend heroin addicted lives of a group of friends in Scotland is one of the most despairing looks at drug abuse and it's lethal appeal ever committed to film. It is also incredibly funny in parts at the same time. That is what makes the film so unique. You're cringing one minute and laughing out loud the next.<br /><br />That said I can't recommend the film to everyone. It is pretty disturbing and graphic so viewer beware. If you have the stomach for it you will be rewarded with one of the best films of the 90's.
B000002UAC|5.0|Great album but if you can find Meet the Beatles! it is the only US release that was better than the UK release, it has less songs ad more original songs.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Take a rat, add lots of wild and dangerous chase scenes, add a few recipes, finish off with a message that may be too deep for children and you might wind up with this film.  This film is somewhere in the middle of Pixar's output.  It is not the best but not the worst.  Our rat is unusual.  He does not like the standard rat diet of garbage.  He has a refined palette which his family exploits to check for poison.  But he is unhappy.  A violent episode lands him in Paris where he finds the restaurant of his chef hero.  Here he has adventures with avoiding the staff and trying to cook.  Add two villains (yes, two), the restaurant's current owner and a food critic and our rat's life gets very complicated.  This is a long film with much of it taken up by chase scenes.  The cooking scenes are fun and clever.  But in the middle we have the lone rat who does not fit in with other rats or with people as he keeps trying to be what he is not in order to please others.  It is only in the end when he finds a way to be true to himself that things begin to go well.  Great message but a little out there for the kids.  The understood the message in Cars and The Incredibles but they didn't quite get this one as it a more adult problem.  Still, it has plenty of the tings kids like while being intelligent enough for adults.  Check it out.
B000002UAI|5.0|Most do not like this one as much because it is mostly remakes but the beatles always did the best remakes and this album is amazing because they did that and because johns trio at the beginning is such a leap in his musical style and they are so good and paul also has some really good songs on here too. One of my favorites from them .    Highlights  No Reply  I'm a Loser  Rock 'n' Roll Music  I'll Follow the Sun  Mr. Moonlight
0007144350|5.0|This book has it all. If you are an Oscar fan, than it is a must for your collection.
B000002UAO|5.0|This is my favorite album from the Beatles, second favorite album of all after Plastic Ono Band. This album is the most cohesive album I have ever heard everything works perfectly with what was coming next. The songs are  all perfect, even though nowhere man took a while but it has grown on me and no is one of my favorites on the album. The progression in the writing is amazing and the experimentation is not as extreme as revolver or sgt peppers but still there and that is why i like this one more than the other two, nothing is taken to far everything just falls into place so perfectly.    Highlights:  Drive My Car  Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)  You Won't See Me  Nowhere Man  Think for Yourself  The Word  Michelle  What Goes On  Girl  I'm Looking Through You  In My Life  Wait  If I Need Someone    and yes that is every song on the album, i said it is perfect (for me at least)  Run for Your Life

B000002UB3|5.0|while not my favorite beatles album, it is still amazing. The first side has great song after great song and the second side fits so well together and the trio at the end is perfection. great album, awesome cover, awesome band,  and just one of their best albums.    Highlights:  Come Together  Something  Oh! Darling  I Want You (She's So Heavy)  Because  Here Comes the Sun  Golden Slumbers/Carry that Weight/The End
B000056K04|3.0|I've never been a huge fan.  Dave's voice annoys me after a little while.  I do think this is my favorite album by them.  Many fans don't seem to like it but I can't understand why.  Angel is my favorite track on here.  This album got me into their other work which I had previously written off.
B000002UAX|5.0|As my friend says, \\"Everything the Bible doesn't say, is in the White Album\\". This album may have some of their worst songs but the rest is perfection. Every time I listen to it I have a new favorite, the songs grow on me or they leave and come back, Hell Helter Skelter is kind growing on me. The album has everything I could ever ask for; however, this is not my favorite Beatles album, that goes to Rubber Soul.  Highlights  Dear Prudence  While my Guitar Gently Weeps  Happiness is a Warm Gun  Why Don't We Do It in the Road?  Julia (favorite as of this moment, so touching and beautiful)  Birthday  Long Long Long  Revolution 1
037571457X|5.0|I've been waiting for a book like this to come out for years...something about a modern girl, growing up in Iran, exactly during this time, presented in a unique way. Persepolis is perfect! I love the fact that Satrapi presented her story as a graphic novel--genius! All of her characters, the names, the places, the stories of her family and neighbors and friends, the atrocities, everything reminded me of the same names and stories I grew up with here in the U.S., told to me by my Iranian father and grandmother. I felt like Marji was a relative of mine, and found myself in tears in several places in this book. I read it with my daughter, too, because I thought that it was a good way to introduce her to one aspect of her heritage. She loved it as much as I did! Neither one of us could put it down. I look forward to reading the second volume of her life in Austria.
B00000JNO1|5.0|And that's just the way it is. They're all that good in my book. Every one of 'em. Stop yer nitpickin'. Nuthin' Fancy (1975) may be nothing fancy, but it sure is something special. Saturday Night Special, On The Hunt, Am I Losin' and Whiskey Rock-A-Roller are all Lynyrd Skynyrd classics from this album. I also like the slow blues Cheatin' Woman and Ronnie Van Vant's personal declaration of independence, I'm A Country Boy. The acoustic roots-music Made In The Shade works for me, too. This is all great music! Saturday Night Special is top-of-the-line Skynyrd rock that addresses the issue of gun control and the availability of cheap handguns. Van Zant gives us an example.<br /><br />Two feets they come a creepin'<br />Like a black cat do<br />And two bodies laying naked<br />Creeper thinks he's got nothing to lose<br />So he creeps into this house<br />And unlocks the door<br />And as a man's reaching for his trousers<br />He shoots him full of .38 holes<br /><br />Nuthin' Fancy, but strong stuff! Whiskey Rock-A-Roller is quintessential Lynyrd Skynyrd party-on-the-road rock n' roll and a great song, too. Of course, every one of these songs has great Lynyrd Skynyrd signature guitar work. This isn't my favorite Skynyrd album, but it's one that's essential to the Lynyrd Skynyrd catalog, and one that I like very much. Any Lynyrd Skynyrd album with Ronnie Van Zant is a classic, if you ask me.
0887306667|5.0|Now this is one of the most simple books I've ever read on the subject, but it's chock full of the true rules on marketing.<br /><br />Some might say it's a slap in the face or without substance but the TRUTH is that these are very simple laws, and if applied correctly will help one be able to market.<br /><br />I always refer to this book when launching a new clients product.  Of course, you can't market without research and many other things, but if you apply these simple laws to your research and creative content, you will do well.  So the truth is it's simple.  It's not rocket science and it can be done..
0385339100|4.0|I have always enjoyed this book immensely.  The way Patrick orchestrates his crime is phenomenal and you find yourself rooting for him to somehow pull it off - even if you have moral qualms about whether you really want him to or not.  Grisham constantly keeps us on the fence about whether Patrick is the good guy.  He has moments of humantiy and compassion, especially in his ultimate treatment of the child who isn't his own, as well as his friendship with Clovis. But we're then confronted with his smugness, his \\"f- you\\" attitude for the establishment, and the moral ambiguity of stealing \\"dirty\\" money.<br /><br />**Spoilers to the end** It almost seems that Grisham is testing the reader's morality - should Patrick really live happily ever after or not?  And the way he tests us is through the ending that people hate so much.  If we believe that Patrick was justified in all he did, then we're angry that he couldn't ride off into the sunset with the girl.  But if we find ourselves a little uncomfortable with the way Patrick played everybody, then we'll accept the ending because it's what he deserved.  The only problem I have with the ending is that it does come out of nowhere.  We never see any foreshadowing or motivation for her to run off with the money.  The only explanation is that she was planning it the whole time - she never loved him, she never intended to run away with him, but she needed him to be in the clear so no one would come looking for her (they found him, so they'd find her).  So ultimately the player got played.  What goes around comes around.<br /><br />Personally I feel like the ending completely justifies the book's existence - otherwise it's just a flashy story about a guy who steals a ton of money, gets away with it, and lives happily ever after.  Kind of pointless and a little troubling.  But Grisham had more to say than that.  He probably could have said it better, but it was fitting that Patrick ultimately paid a price for his deeds.
B000I2J0W4|5.0|The Shining is perhaps one of the greatest horror films ever made. Like Jack Torrance, its writer, director and creator Stanley Kubrick had an obsession.  Kubrick was one of Hollywood's finest director but he believed everything, including the slightest detail had to be perfect. Kubrick loved Stephen King's novel but felt that it had flaws so he decided with his writing parter that he would take the concept and characters of Jack Torrance and his wonderful adventure in the old Overlook Hotel and create a more eerie and sadistic story.     King allowed Kubrick to take his novel and create a movie out of it, giving it a physical life. Although King loved Kubrick's envision of The Shining, he was upset of how Kubrick changed some of the roles of characters and the storyline. King did not believe in Jack Nicholson's character as Jack Torrance, the simple and kind abusive drunk who goes from teacher, to lonely writer to psychopath serial killer. Jack Nicholson has a history of being a bit loony in his films which is obviously true. King did not like Nicholson as a Jack Torrance because he did not want the audience to witness Nicholson and automatically assume that he will turn into a psychopath based upon his history in films prior to the Shining. Jack Torrance at first is to appear as a warm, loving family man who later goes insane due to isolation, alcoholic withdrawal and maybe perhaps the afterlife presence that exists within the hotel itself. King did not believe that Nicholson could play the role of Jack Torrance.   Clearly when you watch a Nicholson film, you can see right from the start that he is a truly gifted actor, superior to most of the crap that is portrayed today. Nicholson is able to pull off various roles. He excels in the crazy, psychopath role which is what Jack Torrance later turns out to be. The premise of the Shining is to have a strong believable Jack Torrance, you need, the movie cannot survive without a powerful performance. Nicholson was the perfect fit for this film. He knew, the cast and crew knew it and Kubrick knew it. Although King is a brilliant author, he is as crazy as his characters if he believes that Nicholson was not perfectly suited for this film. The Shining, I guarantee some day, there will be another theatrical remake, whoever assumes the role of Jack Torrance has mighty shoes to fill. They must live up to Nicholson's standards.     Kubrick's envision of King's novel is a masterpiece. This film was not nominated for any academy awards... it should have been especially when you see all the garbage that wins awards in today's \\"questionable\\" standards. The movie should have been nominated for best film, best director, best actor and best actress. Sadly, it wasn't. The movie is brilliant. Kubrick was very obsessed with his work and he didn't care how tired the actors were or how much of the studio's money he was spending, he had to have double digit outtakes on his roles of film for each scene. He was the drill sergeant of films directors. He made the cast and crew earn their paychecks. He drove them insane. When you see crazy yet brilliant performances from Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall in this film its not only because they're talented but also because they were tired of Kubrick that they began to lose it. Their frustration in the film showed in their performances. Nicholson's dramatic impression with the ax wasn't far from the truth, he really was beginning to go insane. Thats why his role in this film is so powerful, because it was real. Although he loved Kubrick, at points he probably wanted to hack the famous director into tiny little pieces. Kubrick in all of his films reached for perfection when clearly he worked with a mortal cast and crew.     The Shining is a movie that leaves you guessing because you don't really know for sure whether or not there are supernatural beings living within the Hotel because whatever so called \\"ghosts\\" you see are either an imagination of the young and gifted child of Danny or the crazy father Jack. The only proof of supernatural beings is when Jack is locked in the food bin and someone lets him out. Now there are several answers to this,  it could have been the wife, it could have subconsciously been the son or the last resort could have been the spirits that are kept alive through  the power and memories of the hotel. Kubrick does not want to give it away to his audience and like Hitchcock, he leaves you guessing. The point of Jack reaching his last step towards insanity must be fulfilled through his great escape from his enclosure. Once free, he not only physically releases himself from his shackles, but mentally his mind goes a muck and he releases the psychopath within that perhaps always was part of him but was just suppressed. The symbol of Jack losing his sanity is when he is at the bar talking to the bartender and he is offered the drink of whiskey. At first, he looks at it and wonders whether or not its right for him but finally he gives in and drinks the alcohol. Keep in mind, Jack was a recovering Alcoholic that had been sober for months. That scene where it takes a few seconds for him to decide whether or not he should or shouldn't drink the liquor, that symbolizes the struggle between his sanity and insanity, two different egos of his mind. Ultimately his sanity is lost.     Shelley Duvall, although not a pretty actress to look at, is the perfect choice for the role of Wendy, Jack's concerned wife. King criticized Duvall as not being as strong and Independent as he made Wendy out to be in his novel. This is completely false. Wendy essentially does Jack's job that he originally was hired to do, she is the caretaker of the hotel because she looks after it, runs it and takes care of it. You do not see Jack taking care of the hotel at all. She makes sure the boiler is running she knows the kitchen well, she makes minor adjustments to the hotel while Jack is typing away gibberish on his typewriter. Shealso stirs Jack's emotions and causes him to go deeper into his isolation which causes him to crave alcohol and later go insane. She looks after the family, especially her little boy Danny. She is the heroine of the film. Duvall  plays a powerful and convincing role. She makes up for her appearance by   acting as Nicholson's foil and you can tell right from the start, there is a good chemistry between the two characters. They portray the average American family because not all couples look like Angelina and Brad, so therefore it is more realistic because people can relate to the characters. Duvall is not the greatest actress, there are far worse but she truly shined in this movie, no pun intended. She gave Wendy life and meaning. Her body language and accent is perfect for the film because at first you get the impression that she is this dumb senseless brunette but she later evolves, showing her true colors and you understand who wears the pants in the family the same way Hilary Clinton dominates her marriage with Bill. She proved to be Kubrick's perfect choice because he was not looking at her face or breasts when he chose her, he was looking into her soul. Many actresses may be pretty but the question is, can they act? Duvall proved her case in the Shining showing that looks are not everything.     The Shining was released on HD shortly after Toshiba began creating and distributing HD players and movies. I personally owned the Shining on regular DVD but when I learned that it was released in a more superior format, I jumped at the chance the own the HD version of this film.                  I'm not the type to buy multiple formats of DVDs that I already have. The Shining was an exception because this truly is a remarkable film. Its brilliantly acted and directed and the scenery for the time was remarkable. This had a decent budget, it was not a B movie like Night of the Living Dead. This was one of Nicholson's finest performances and probably Shelley Duvall's best. Kubrick's interpretation of the Shining was far superior to the made for TV film that was produced by King himself which was a complete waste of time and not because of the budget and production but the acting was better, the script was better, the props and sets were better and the storyline was more dark and dreary. I do not recommend the TV version of the Shining at all.   The HD format looks unbelievable, so much clearer and crisp. This movie was made for HD especially the end when Nicholson shows his true colors, his persona of his own personal life. The extras as the same extras that are on the 2 disc special edition of the Shining. The extras are not in HD but it doesn't matter because your not buying the movie for special features but for the feature itself. The movie looks amazing on a 50 inch 1080p HDTV especially when Nicholson drills a hole in the bathroom door with his trusted rusty friend ax, sticks his head through the hole and yells out \\"HEREEESSSSS JONHNNNYYYYYYY!!! This is a must buy. I would recommend buying this movie NOW because very soon, Toshiba will be taking HD movies and players off the market due to the competition with Sony's Bluray. Its also available on Bluray, but if you have an HD player and you want to stock up cheap titles, this is definitely the one to buy. This is a fantastic film, if you don't believe me, check it out for yourself. I hope this review was helpful.     - Chris B -
0452270073|4.0|When the First World War broke out, most people assumed it would be over in a few months as their nation (whichever one that was) sent the others packing. In fact, many raced to enlist fearing that \\"the fun\\" might be over before they got there.<br /><br />Instead, what they discovered in Western Europe was a stalemate with trenches dug from the North Sea to the Atlantic Coast across which English, French, and German soldiers faced each other for years from cold, wet, corpse-filled, and disease-ridden trenches.<br /><br />No one knew how to break the stalemate. Millions died as shelling continued against these fixed positions.<br /><br />Every so often some general would convince himself that a massive charge would break the other line. Each time this was tried, the slaughter accelerated as men ran into point-blank machine gun fire and artillery barrages.<br /><br />Regeneration looks at the disillusionment that led one decorated English officer and poet, Siegfried Sassoon, to remonstrate against the military leadership in public. Rather than court-marital Sassoon, the military chose to send him to a psychiatrist, Dr. William Rivers. Regeneration creates a fictional account of their relationship at Craiglockhart War Hospital. The book also looks at how Rivers treated other \\"mental\\" cases sent his way.<br /><br />The most interesting parts of the story come in looking at the ethical dilemma of being asked to help those who cannot mentally deal with the war any more . . . when that \\"help\\" may lead to them going back to France where their life expectancy is measured in weeks. I was reminded of stories I've read about patching up people who tried to kill themselves so they could be legally executed.<br /><br />There's a revolting section on how less sensitive physicians dealt with these \\"mental\\" problems . . . basically torturing soldiers until they wouldn't resist going back to fight.<br /><br />The book has two weaknesses that mar its obvious strengths in recapturing that difficult moment in English history.<br /><br />1. Ms. Barker assumes that her readers already know about Siegfried Sassoon (or at least that they don't mind her holding back details about what he did for some time). I had never heard of him so it was annoying to try to figure out what all the fuss was about in the early pages. The book could use an extensive historical footnote as a prologue for those who don't know about the incident.<br /><br />2. The book often skates around the edges of how Sassoon and Rivers related to one another. Much is tacit, and I found it hard to understand in all scenes what Ms. Barker was trying to suggest each one was thinking.<br /><br />I commend Ms. Barker for picking real characters and bringing them to life in a way that's very poignant (even for those who aren't English) 90 years after the events have taken place.Barker assumes that her readers already know about Siegfried Sassoon (or at least that they don't mind her holding back details about what he did for some time).

B000TGJ8AS|5.0|NCIS is one of the best series on TV. I love the humor and innuendo as well as the story lines that keep you guessing. The characters personal lives are revealed more in the 4th season. The stories draw you in as a well written and planned out mystery. They make you feel as if you are there trying to solve the crime yourself. It is refreshing to see a team that works and plays together so well. It is a reflection of true working relationships whether functional or dysfunctional. I look forward to each story to see where my emotions will take me whether I be laughing hysterically or crying uncontrollably, I am totally entertained.

I love travel, have been on a spiritual path for 30 years, love having new meditations to help me rid mind, body and soul of negativity, love excellent writers who make me laugh a lot and also make me cry from being deeply moved. This book was written for me! I have both the book and the book on CD from my local library. Elizabeth Gilbert does a great job of narrating her own book. She has a pleasant, well modulated voice. As an English major, I liked her structure of having a third of the book set in Italy, a third set in India and the last third set in Indonesia. As a psychotherapist, I cheer her journey from the depths of depression to transcendent joy with roadmaps to share on how to get there. I relate to her experience of finding her higher divine self and assurance of the omnipresence of a loving God. You go, girl!

B0006Z2KYI|4.0|In the midst of World War II, before the Americans had entered into the fray, Ernst Lubitsch made what appears on the face of it an oxymoron: a light-hearted comedy about the Polish Resistance to the Nazis.  (The film was released just after Pearl Harbor, but had been in the works while the United States continued to stand on the sidelines.)  Of course, while it does end up being quite funny, the film has a much more serious subtext -- about the responsibilities of Hollywood (and of the United States) in the face of the increasing dangers faced by countries across Europe.<br /><br />An acting troupe in Warsaw prior to the Polish invasion is planning a production to expose the dangers of Nazism, when they are shut down for fear of angering the Germans.  Their practice in portraying Nazis, however, becomes extremely valuable when they are needed to keep information regarding the Polish resistance out of the hands of the Gestapo.  The story is very clever, and played with panache by a delightful cast of characters lead by Carole Lombard and Jack Benny.<br /><br />What makes the film especially interesting, apart from being a fine Lubitsch comedy, is the film's message to the audience and to other filmmakers about the responsibilities and limitations of the artist during wartime.  The director of the Polish acting troupe  wants them to make a serious play about Nazis; the actors want to make it into a comedy.  Still, their actions proceed from a false perception of their safety -- it is easy to criticize the enemy when he is not at the gates.  As I take it, the message of the film is that artists (both actors and filmmakers) should not be afraid to use their unique talents in the service of war, and should not be afraid to risk their lives and repuations, and that their power and potential should not be underestimated.  A further message seems to be that humor and satire can be more effective than serious propaganda.  An enjoyable film in its own right that also provides a valuable window into a period of American and world history.s a valuable window into a period of American and world history.

How disheartening to find that not only was the author as self-obsessed and shallow as she appeared in the opening chapters - she was worse! I can imagine that the bestselling success of this book has done nothing to encourage her to improve herself or actually go within. Such a great premise, such a lousy delivery. I'm disgusted.
B000P12LWY|5.0|THE TUDORS is about the life and times of a sometimes immature and irritable but always lusty English tyrant (Henry VIII). The main plot thread focuses on King Henry's attempts to divorce his loving Catholic, Spanish wife, the Queen, who has not produced a male heir to his throne. Other story elements include court intrigues and loves, international diplomatic fencing and England in the Plague. Henry VIII is protrayed as a younger, athletic man, not the grossly fat king we have often seen on the screen and in paintings. Populated with top-drawer actors, THE TUDORS is a visual feast for the eyes with stylish and beautiful costumes and authentic sets. Showtime is to be commended for a suberb production, rivaling anything HBO has done.
0312330871|5.0|\\"And Then There Were None\\" by Agatha Christie, © 1939, 1940, renewed 1967.<br /><br /> This was a very strange story.  Of course, Ms. Christie is very good at writing, but to imagine this tale is impressive.  It is a simple enough story: ten people are invited to spend some time on an island; they find a poem, a take off of the 'ten little Indians'; then they are all bumped off, one by one.  You realize that these people are the subjects of the lines in the poem, but how to find out who is killing them is the question.  The answer is supplied, fortuitously, by a letter in a bottle found later.  It was a really amazing story.

B000U1ZV8K|1.0|The good:  Four films (the first two of which are awesome) at a great price.    The bad:  The Lethal Weapon 4 isn't really what you might think it should be.    Explanation:  If you've seen Lethal Weapon 4 on DVD, then you know what the best parts of it are -- the deleted seasons from the first three movies, and the behind the scenes / gag reel.  This is what you expect.  The problem is, those features are *NOT* included in this set.  Each film is presented as one side of a two-disc set (LW1 is disc 1 side 1, LW2 is disc 1 side 2, LW3 is disc 2 side 1, and LW4 is disc 2 side 2).  The problem is that the good features of LW4 were on side 2 of the original DVD.  So when you click on the dynamite icon to show those features, the menu says to flip the disc.  Well, since it's not the real disc, you can't do that (LW3 is on the flip side of the disc).  In other words, no special features.    If you're buying this set to get the first three films, you're probably saving yourself some cash.  But do yourself a favor and buy Lethal Weapon 4 separately so you can actually see the special features (which are, by far, better than the film).

B00001ODGR|5.0|Sometimes seeing a concert video by a favorite artist can be disillusioning.  For example, watching a Queen concert video helped change me from being a Queen fan to having no use for the group.  (The lyrics for a lot of their songs was also a factor.)<br /><br />What about Styx?  Styx is one band I always considered one of my favorites.  I would lump them in a group below my two favorite secular bands Little River Band and the Bangles (I'm not putting them in competition with Christian bands).  This lump would include Yes, the Go Gos, Crowded House, Simple Minds, Talking Heads, ELO, and others.<br /><br />After watching this video, Styx has emerged as being in a solid third place.  The music has always been great, but I've noticed a more positive outlook in their lyrics.<br /><br />Before going philosophical/theological, let me start with the music.  One disappointment with the above mentioned Queen video was that they avoided the complex vocal harmonies they are famous for.  Styx did not do this at all.  I think the only Memorex moment was the intro keyboards on \\"Lorelei\\", which allowed Dennis DeYoung more flexibility in singing.  This was the exception.  The complex instrumentals and the great vocal harmonies of Styx were present.  My only disappointment was that they didn't do \\"Mr. Roboto.\\"<br /><br />One thing that I had the impression of was this band was having fun, not just playing their instruments and singing, but doing so together.  Maybe it was a grand illusion, but I doubt it.  Mark Shaw's commentary made it sound genuine (more on that later).<br /><br />Decades ago, in Bob Larson's book dealing with rock, he goes through several groups with their problems.  When mentioning Styx, his only concern in his commentary is their name refers to the River to Hell in mythology; he himself mentioned he had no complaints about lifestyle, lyrics, or graphics as he did with other groups.<br /><br />There are three things in the video that bothered me, and those things were not deal breakers (as opposed to Jewel's \\"Who's Going To Save Your Soul?\\" in her video was to me, or Freddy Mercury saying the f word to the audience in Queen's video).  Those things were 1) Jack Young seeming to make fun of preachers in the intro to \\"Snowblind\\" (which may have been a genuine mockery of Christians, or it may have been him being a ham), 2) Dennis DeYoung using a cuss word in the introduction to \\"Grand Illusion\\" (my favorite song by Styx, no less), though the context made it less offensive to me than Mercury's cussing, as well as that this was a PG word instead of an R rated one, and 3) in drummer Todd Sucherman's video, one of the extra features, he flipped off the camera as it was showing him drumming.<br /><br />I've mentioned the extra features a couple of times.  The back stage commentary by Tommy Shaw was fun and enjoyable.  So was Todd's video, except for the mentioned scene.  There is the title track of Styx's then new album, \\"Brave New World\\".<br /><br />The most disappointing extra feature was the Styx story.  This was more in text as opposed to video.  It was very condensed.  It told nothing of how the band started.  It merely mentioned they were successful before they took a hiatus, that three of the four original members had success individually (with the exception of Cuck Panozzo, who I assume is the bassist), and that their reunion became long-term.  Tommy's comments were more helpful than this brief blurb.<br /><br />One other criticism for me is that without Tommy's comments I would not know which one was Tommy and which one was Dennis.  They could have told more about the other members.<br /><br />I am impressed that Dennis has a marriage that in '96 was longer than mine currently is (I'm approaching my silver marriage).  This is not the norm period, and less so in the entertainment industry.<br /><br />In conclusion, this has been an enjoyable video.<br /><br />Jeff\\"Who's Going To Save Your Soul?\\" in her video was to me, or Freddy Mercury saying the f word to the audience in Queen's video).

B000I2MRHE|1.0|After great experiences with smaller Lamaze toys for my infant (especially the sensory cube) and after a remark by the pediatrician that my infant was a bit behind with rolling over and such due to GERD issues that limited time on her tummy or flat on her back, I bought this item.  While it's attractive, it did nothing more than what and ordinary Boppy or even a blanket on the floor would have done for her.  In fact, concentrating pressure on her torso shifted her reflux into overdrive.     What a waste of money for us.  However, the mat will make a nice wall decoration in the nursery.
B000059MEK|5.0|Homework. Alive.  All those were cool, esp. homework which I highly recommend.  But NONE of them have the impact of discovery.  People have criticized this for not being modern enough as far as electronica as a genre--but some people just don't know what they're buying or listening too.  Being a fan of both disco and vocal house this was all love for me; all admirers of the genre: do not miss this album!
B000YAFJYS|5.0|\\"Persepolis\\" (2007), written and directed by Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud, is a beautifully made film that recounts an engaging tale, that also happens to be true. It is important to point out that even though this is an animated film, it is definitely not for children. Nonetheless, I firmly believe that this funny and somewhat wistful movie is a rare gem that teenagers and adults will appreciate in its full value.<br /><br />This film is based on the autobiography of one of its directors, Marjane Satrapi, a young woman that grew up in Iran, and lived there both before and after the Iranian revolution that established an Islamic Fundamentalist government, drastically reducing personal liberties and imposing a completely different lifestyle on its citizens, specially on women.<br /><br />Marjane's story allows us to see her as a young and enthusiastic child that shares her parents hopes regarding the new regime, and as a rebellious teenager that cannot understand the limitations that affect women in her country, and that is sent abroad by her parents in order to protect her. We suffer with Marjane when she tries to find herself in Austria, and understand her feelings when she decides to return to Iran in order to be with her family.<br /><br />What happens then? Well, you have to watch this film in order to find out that. All the same, I can let you know that I loved \\"Persepolis\\", and that I think that this simple and powerful film is highly likely to strike a cord in you. Highly recommended...<br /><br />Belen Alcat
0060575816|5.0|I loved this book. It was exciting, mysterious and eventful. The rest of the series was just as good if not better. The world that surrounds the story is rich and imaginitave and the characters are unique and special. Overall I loved this book and this series and reccomend it to teenagers and adults alike.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I just finished watching the \\"The Ark of Truth\\" and can sum it up in [1] word: ==FANTASTIC==. Of course I have every movie in the series and to get full enjoyment you need to know a little STARGATE SG1 history! They really pulled out all the stops when filming this one.    As soon as they start selling the next in the series \\"CONTINUM\\" [filming is supposed to begin on MAY 23, 2008], I'll order it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0011FXLCC|5.0|I know a lot of people keep saying this is a change of pace for Goldfrapp but I don't really think so. Certainly the erotic glam beat of other works is missing this time around HOWEVER a more pastoral sound isn't really out of character. Those who listened to ALL the songs on Black Cherry and Supernature will know that Goldfrapp has done quieter material that is just as engaging as the rock/disco/stomp (and of course let's not forget Felt Mountain which some newer fans seem to disregard)that got them a more rock oriented audience. So relax. Let Allison and company pull you into their wonderful world. It'll be great. And even better, there's no telling what they'll come up with next time.

0751532711|5.0|This is the first book that I have read, that has greatly influenced my way of thinking about business and money.  Yes, I have to credit this book with having impacted my life.  I absolutely love Robert Kiyosaki and everything that he stands for.  I appreciate his style and purpose of teaching readers the differences between an asset and a liability.  And even more his teachings of what he classifies as the four quadrants E (Employee)/S (Self employed or Small business)/B (Big Business)/I (Investor).  The key to true wealth from Kiyosaki's perspective is to make the leap from Entrepreneur or Self employed, to Big Business and/or Investor.  Who knew that being self employed or running a small business would still keep you in the Rat Race!
B000268QB2|5.0|I highly recommend getting this cd - every song is worth listening to, over and over again. It is that good. All relatable lyrics and the melodies are fantastic. A must have in any ipod/mp3...
1591396190|4.0|Is it possible to find a book to be boring and interesting at the same time?   * In Blue Ocean Strategy, some sections of the book I found myself re-reading twice just to ensure I fully understood the author's intent.    * Other parts, I entirely skipped over due to extreme boredom.    * And in other sections, I fully embraced the content and couldn't get enough!   This very complex, hard-hitting, detailed book is perfect for business junkies who want to learn innovative strategic methods for increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of their business operations.  If you are ready to THINK and ACT outside the box and take your business to another level, by differentiating your products and services and separating yourself from the competition, then this book is for you.
B000002J1B|5.0|Anything Yes does is amazing. It's that simple. I own almost every single release the group ever put out.<br /><br />But, I have a very sentimental connection to this record: This was the first Yes record I ever bought. The record is killer; even though there are three songs, the three here are simply incredible.<br /><br />The highlight of the record is of course the 22-minute 'The Gates of Delirium'; Patrick Moraz is no Rick Wakeman, but he proves that he knows how to jam.<br /><br />The excerpt to listen to is of course 'Soon.' The excerpt has become a concert favorite over the years, not to mention a fan favorite.<br /><br />'Sound Chaser' is a great song, featuring some superb slide guitar from Steve Howe. Anderson's vocals are heavier than on previous albums, such as 'Fragile,' but it proves that he can sing it all.<br /><br />And, the closing track is the calm and relaxing 'To Be Over.' This is a nice 9-minute song and is still to this day one of my favorite Yes songs.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended for any Yes fan. But, you may want to buy Rhino's 2003 remaster, which features bonus tracks, including a rare studio run-through of 'The Gates of Delirium' and the single edit of 'Sound Chaser.'<br /><br />Highly recommended for any Yes fan. ENJOY!!!
0887307280|4.0|Very much like my favorite book Rich Dad Poor Dad, this book snaps some reality into everyone who runs a small business or desires to start a business.  After reading this book you'll soon discover that every business owner falls into three categories: Manager, Technician, and Entrepreneur.  However, According to Michael E. Gerber the reason why most business's fail is because most small business owners become too heavily weighted in one trait, rather than a balance of all three.  Gerber shows you that by running around like a crazy person and working hard doing all the work that you will never be able to take your business to the next level.  The trick is to set up your business to run exclusive of YOU!  But how...?  E-Myth will show you!
B000MRA5NS|5.0|I think this is probably one of my favorite Bond movies ever. I'm not sure I'd say that Daniel Craig is quite as good as Sean Connery as far as Bonds go, but the plot and lack of cheesiness of Casino Royale were a welcome improvement over recent Bond movies.
1582701709|5.0|Based on the Laws of Attraction and the many ideals surrounding \\"manifestation\\" and \\"what you focus on becomes reality\\", the book demonstrates the power of your thoughts and feelings, and how it can lead to action.  Full of inspirational passages in a quick and easy to read format.     I brought the DVD movie and was quite satisfied, but when a friend suggested I read the book, I am glad I did because in my opinion, it's even better! The reason why--you control the pace based on your current needs.  I would find myself reading a little bit each night before I went to bed, amazingly enough the sections that I would read were ALWAYS in sync and aligned to what I needed to hear about or read about most at that point in time.  You know how when you go to your place of worship and the pastor, teacher, or adviser says something that resonates as if he were talking directly to you?  Well that is how I felt many nights reading the passages.  Then when I would wake up in the morning, the readings were still heavy in my thoughts so I would put into practice what I had read the evening before.  I had a new attitude and way of thinking each day and was ready to embrace positive thinking, feeling and actions.  Here's another analogy...have you ever walked into your place of worship feeling one way and walked out feeling lighter, better, simply happier?  Well, this is what the Secret can do for you!
B000VI6T6U|5.0|after seeing the hendrix movie, i was very curious about him and purchased live at Monterey.. now i have 3 books and 4 dvds about him. and plan on buying more!!  jimi was sexy, talented, and knew his s*it!! i agree with what one of the reviewers said; noel was rude when he interrupted precious jimi by makin that loud noise with his guitar, but thats what haters do. as usual, the haters only made him stronger. i hope jimis still playin in the heavens!! buy the dvd.
0060763280|5.0|I have read this book several times and will continue to read it again and again until it all sinks in--and all of my thoughts, feelings and desires are put into action! This reminds me of the book, The Secret, but for business minded folks!  Its powerful and easy to read, in no time I was repeating the mantra of T. Harv Ecker, \\"I have a millionaire mind\\", only I took my new-found learnings and changed it to \\"billionaire mindset\\".  This is the power behind the book, it helps to change your thinking.  Ecker is an amazing mentor who offers some valuable insight into how the poor, the middleclass, and the rich think. Of course you may think you already know, but really you have no idea.  Ecker will show you how to unlearn everything you know or ever thought about the rich and shows you how to reprogram your way of thinking.  And very soon you too will have a millionaire mindset and maybe even one day a d billionaire mind!
B0010358CG|2.0|Appleseed E.M. -  This movie's cell-shaded style provides tons of eye candy for Appleseed fans.  The CGI effects are excellent except when it comes to the animation of body movement and character interaction in non-action scenes.  I'm not sure if it's the affects of the CGI cell-shading or if it's by design (cuz it seems rather glaring to me), but the characters seem to move like plastic dolls.  There are scenes in which human flesh is depicted to come in contact with metallic cyborgs (such as the scenes between Deunan and Briareros), but because of the clunky animation of the bodies and the seemingly unresponsive physical contact between characters, I miss out on the emotional conflict of what it must be like to be in love with a machine. The action gun-fight sequences are outrageous, but that is to be expected with John Woo at the helm of production.  Personally, I don't mind the over-the-top flipping, looping, twisting, whirling gun fights.  Those scenes are fun to watch, for me.  Buildings, scenery, character models, and vehicle CGI are top-notch.  Overall, most people would be the animation style of Appleseed E.M.    Now what I don't like,(perhaps this is due to the nature of Animes in general) is how little things just don't make any sense.  For instance, in the first action scene, Deunan (the main female protagonist) launches a flash bomb into small group of terrorist before the order to attack was given.  I understand a part of that scene was to illustrate she's an independent and strong woman not privy to the command of others at times...but the flash bomb really didn't provide any additional advantage to the ESWAT attack. Did I miss something?  Why did she throw that flash grenade and jeopardize the entire mission?  Then, after the scene in which Briareros grabs Deunan and jumps out of the chapel window, one of the ESWAT member holds her back from running to his body. Why couldn't she run to his body? Perhaps I'm too nit-picky, but for anyone who is like me, this ruins a movie.  I would have given the movie at least a 4 were it not for those bits of the storyline which left a bad taste for me.

1400049628|5.0|The world is awash in zombies, as anyone can see by watching reality shows or news reports of political rallies. It's only a matter of time before they march on your innocent community to devour the pre-softened brains of your loved ones. But rest assured that there is better practical advice available than the \\"put duct tape on your windows\\" gibberish that you get from government bureaucrats. First, Max Brooks lays out the physiology and psychology of zombies, because understanding your enemy is the key to victory and survival. But don't think that you can just throw Molotov cocktails at any old zombie. You need to have a detailed plan, and Max Brooks provides the knowledge for what could be years of war against zombie terror. I for one was a bit perturbed by how much planning and preparation is required - is Brooks trying to tell me that I need months of weapons training and that I should learn how to grow my own food? Well that's war for you. If you're not prepared for the long fight then you'll hardly be qualified to complain after the zombies have destroyed your country and stolen your freedom. But thanks to Max Brooks and his very detailed and practical survival manual, they'll never take me alive! Or dead... [~doomsdayer520~]
B0010YSD7M|5.0|First off I am reviewing the retail release of this movie. Not a bootleg version minus the special effects and score.<br /> I liked the movie and it is good to have closure of the season 10 plot line. I have been a long time fan and while I am not fond of the Cameron Mitchell and Vala characters I suppose they served to help carry the plot in Rick Dean's absence. Besides, \\"props\\" must be given to Farscape and if this is what it takes for them to pay the bills, I will play along.<br /><br /> All in all this is a must buy if you want to close the story arc of season 10.
0618918248|5.0|Boken gir en strukturert og udogmatisk gjennomgang av ulike måter å vurdere eksistensen av en høyere makt. Ved å bruke enkle bilder som \\"spaghettimonster\\" og \\"allmektig tekanne\\", skaper han et skille mellom vår trang til å visualisere en personlighet og koble den til personlighetens egenskaper. Boken er preget av god britisk humor, samtidig som den er veldig godt strukturert. Den vil ikke ta troen fra noen, men den vil gjøre det lettere å forstå sin egen skepsis og gjøre det lettere å gå fra usikker agnostisisme til reflektert gudløshet.  Svein

B00004RD54|5.0|A lot of reviewers try to pigeonhole this album as glam-rock or arena-rock. Forget the labels, just enjoy the music. This album captures the magic of a great touring band at its zenith. The two guitarists, Steve Hunter & Dick Wagner  are so tastefully creative and melodic that they breathe new life into Lou Reed's stark compositions. This is simply one of the greatest rock guitar albums of all time and should be part of every electric guitar lovers collection. Lou's detached punk-style vocals are an excellent counterpoint to the passionate virtuosity that embellishes the tunes. The whole band cooks and I suppose the best testimony I can give is that I wore out two vinyl versions back in the seventies and am now enjoying the cd. Also recommended is LOU REED LIVE, taken from the same show at the Academy of Music in NYC
B000ZN802W|5.0|When I rented this dvd I had no idea what it was about.  Needless to say it is a powerful film that has had a definate effect on me.  Can't get this kid out of my head.

B00006DEFA|5.0|This is the director's cut version of the critically acclaimed movie, \\"Amadeus,\\" which premiered in 1984.<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie.  The acting is superb, it is visually beautiful, and of course the music is beyond words....besides, it's nice to be \\"historically entertained\\" (i.e., I learn something, but don't realize it because I'm enjoying myself).<br /><br />I actually bought the movie for my grandson to enjoy when he gets older.  In the meantime, my son watched it and loved it too.
B0012Q94QW|2.0|10,000 B.C. is a sprawling, messy, jaw-dropping, silly, enjoyable bit of forgettable fun.  It's the most disposable epic movie I've ever seen.  Roland Emmerich, who has brought us fluffy epic fun before with INDEPENDENCE DAY and DAY AFTER TOMORROW, certainly has a grasp on how to bring moments to film that will stick with the viewer.  Long after forgetting the details of these former blockbusters, I still remember the image of the White House being blasted to bits or Manhattan encrusted in ice.  With this latest effort, I suppose I might remember the stampeding wooly mammoths.  Or I might not.  It's been 5 days since I saw the movie, and I can barely remember half of what happened.    It tells the story of a tribe of early humans who survive by hunting mammoths.  They live in the foothills of a giant mountain range, and are pretty isolated from the rest of the world.  But when another tribe invades and snags many of their best hunters, presumably to enslave them...our intrepid hero and his older mentor head off into unknown lands to save their fellow tribesmen.  Naturally, one of the prisoners is also the love interest for our hero.    As this little band of travelers moves, they go from the blistering cold of the high mountains to the grassy lowlands where they meet a friendly tribe who join them on their quest.  What began as a tiny group determined to win the freedom of some friends turns into a guerilla army comprised of members of several tribes...all eager to free their comrades and bring down an empire that is enslaving all these folks in order to build what looks suspiciously like the Egyptian pyramids...thousands of years before they were really built, of course.    It became almost laughable to see the climactic changes these men went through.  As I said, from foothills to snowcapped mountains, to savannahs, to grasslands, to marshy country to a Saharan desert to a fertile river valley.  We get no sense of how long they have traveled.  Heck, it might havebeen a journey of two years or two weeks for all we can tell.  And each climate has its own distinctive group of indigenous peoples...so we end up with a truly multi-racial and multi-cultural army.  But instead of sending a message about unity...I was mostly perplexed in trying to figure out just where in the world this story was taking place.  Probably Africa...but some of the geography felt more like the Andes mountains of South America.  So it all ended up feeling very generic.    There were a few impressive scenes.  Early on, we see a mammoth hunt, and the scenes of grazing mammoths, turned into stampeding mammoths was well done.  The CGI effects were credible and for about 2 minutes, you can really believe you're getting a sense of how our early ancestors behaved.  (Later CGI of a saber tooth tiger is NOT very believable at all...I have yet to see a large cat done convincingly via CG...just think of Aslan in NARNIA).  Towards the end, the scenes at the city where thousands of slaves and hundreds of mammoths are toiling to build a series of pyramids is nothing short of impressive.  Again, the CG is first-rate, and briefly a sense of awe IS inspired.  I emphasize the word \\"briefly.\\"  Most of the movie is incredibly generic questing stuff, done far better in many movies that have come before...mostly notably in Mel Gibson's brilliant and very exciting APOCALYPTO.      The generic feel is not much helped by the average performances.  The only truly recognizable face is that of Camilla Belle (BALLAD OF JACK & ROSE), who plays the love interest.  She is striking to look at and absolutely, 100% boring.  Everyone else is bland.  An Omar Sharif provides grating narration in a voice that is so filled with silkiness and wonder that it bordered on camp.    I had a decent time watching this film, but I doubt if it will recoup its budget.  I sensed no true enthusiasm for it from the audience I sat with.  Yes, we all came to see the big epic in a very dutiful manner...sheep trained to attend all things where a giant wide-screen is advised.  But we also filed out in a dutiful manner, and no voices were overheard saying, \\"that was fun.\\"  You've certainly seen worse movies, but probably never a movie this big yet forgettable.

B0007YMUZW|5.0|This is Ryan's best album.  I agree that in time this will be looked at as his masterpiece.  There isn't one bad song on here.  The only thing that keeps it from being perfect is the tempo of Beautiful Sorta doesn't really fit the rest of the album.  Life is Beautiful is Adam's best song ever recorded.
B00133KFGW|4.0|It was a really nice movie that caught your attention and made you tap your feet along with the music.  Even my husband enjoyed this movie and he's more of a action/adventure guy.  In the beginning the movie seems somewhat disjointed but at it progresses it mostly comes together.  Would recommnd this movie.
B000IHY9UW|3.0|First, let me start off by saying that Val Kilmer's performance in this film is nothing short of genius.  He literally became Jim Morrison, almost to the point that I thought that Val was actually a mental patient who thought he WAS Jim Morrison.  There are many times during the film that I had to tell myself that it wasn't Jim that had come back from the dead.  Second, Oliver Stone is a brilliant director and he can make the viewer feel as if he has just stepped into a time machine and gone back to visit the 60's--that's how authentic the setting is in this movie.  However, the problem that I sometimes have with Oliver Stone is that he has a tendancy to go a little to overboard in his films, and \\"The Doors\\" is a perfect example of this.  We all know that Jim Morrison was a troubled soul, but, hey, let's face it--most of your artistic geniuses are, which what makes their work so incredible.  Stone, however, made Jim Morrison out to be some acid-draining Nazi that cared only about himself and had violent outbursts all the time.  In reality, though, if one does a little research, one finds out that Jim was only like that some of the time and not every second of his life.  This movie, I felt, failed to show more of the beautiful maverick poet/shaman that Jim, most of the time, really was.  Also, I felt that the sex angle was overplayed a bit, as well.  Obviously Jim had slept with a number of women, and the women that weren't able to, most likely fantasized about being with Jim.  However, it was if this film made Jim out to be so horny that he would actually have sex with mannequins at the local department store.      In reality, when all is said and done, the only real saving grace of this film was Val Kilmer's outstanding performance as well as Stone's accurate re-creation of the trippin' sixties.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I love this disc.  Sara Bareilles has a beautiful voice.  Every song sounds different.  My favorite track is the  \\"Love Song\\".  Sara's piano playing is upbeat and so lively here. \\"Gravity\\" is a slower tempo song about how fragile life can be.  This song is really pretty.  \\"Vegas\\" is a great song about looking for adventure in places like Las Vegas and New York.  There is power and grit in Sara's voice that I really like here.  \\"Morningside\\" is an engaging track about relationships.  It has a sensual soulful quality.  I love the beat of the track \\"Love On The Rocks\\".  She hits notes perfectly on the song.  \\"Fairytale\\" is an interesting spin on the myth of happy endings in fairytales.  \\"Many the Miles\\" is a very good song about the things people do for love.  I love the music on this disc.

B00000APLB|5.0|Initially released as a double-album on September 23, 1977, Love You Live sizzled due to what then was side three (on disc two of the double-CD), the 1977 performances from the El Mocambo club in Toronto, Canada.<br /><br />The four songs - Mannish Boy, Crackin' Up, Little Red Rooster and Around And Around - performed before a raucous audience, sum up the roots of Rock-n-Roll and the power of the band in such an intimate setting.<br /><br />The arena performances are drawn from the Tour of the Americas (1975) and Tour of Europe (1976), with Billy Preston and Ian Stewart on piano. The consummate showmanship of Mick Jagger is especially heard in the tongue-in-cheek classic, Star Star.<br /><br />The Andy Warhol artwork was supplemented by Jagger's pencil smears. The band literally built arena extravaganzas, but it's back to the bars which makes this release a winner.
B000002LTU|4.0|I enjoyed this disc and I compliment the artist and Miles for stepping outside the norm to develope something fresh and funky. This disc will probably be killed by some of those traditional jazz addicts out their but they forget. That Miles is known for stepping outside the circle after all he was the first major jazz artist to incorpate electical instruments in to his band which lead to funky jazz, fusin, and now smooth jazz. Besides some of the old stuff puts me to sleep and has no direction, I gave this 4 stars only because most of the recordings were snythisized I would have liked to hear more of a fat funky bass guitar and a mellow in the pocket guitarist.

0143038419|1.0|I really can't call this a full review it as I couldn't get past the first leg of her journey in Italy.  This was chosen by a member of my book club.  I read 30 pages and put it down and dreaded picking it up again.  I managed about 50 more pages but couldn't go back.  The author's tone is whiny and tries too hard to be witty. I had no sympathy for her so I could not get invested in her need to find herself.  I will gladly pass this book along rather than have it waste space on my shelf as I have no desire to continue the author's \\"journey\\".
0679720200|4.0|The universe does not care for us.    For many, this is a daunting realization.    \\"The Stranger\\" is a fictional account of a senseless murder committed by a man that knows he is alive only through sensory experiences. Everything else, be it his mother's death, his misogynistic neighbor, or even the simple sunlight, means nothing. It has no bearing on Meursault. It does not affect him. It does not concern him. He continues living without consequence.    Until he visits the beach.    It is there that, through unfortunate chance, Meursault murders a hated Arab; yet Meursault knows not why this is, both the hatred and the murder. But it does not stop him.    It is at this point where Camus introduces an absurdist element to \\"The Stranger.\\" Once ensnared in the legal system, Meursault's character undergoes a series of transformations at the hands of others. But Meursault the man, Meusault the persona, remains much the same.    Unchanged.    Camus highlights the banality of persecution, impending death, and salvation, stripping these elements of meaning and instead mocking them as absurd and, ultimately, meaningless.    And for some, this knowledge is salvation.
B000UD08HW|3.0|Just purchased a Blu-ray player and this \\"HD concert\\" and was VERY  Disapointed in the quality as with other reviews.  Very grainy and poor HD for a Blu-ray release.    There should be a disclaimer on the DVD that says, \\"not in original HD\\"    This HD show looks like an \\"up converted 480i\\" show.    Thinking about returning it.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I saw that movie in the cinema and was amazed. Thoughts about it haven't left me since then, so I bought this DVD to watch it again. I'm really impressed and now this DVD is the most precious thing for me on my home desk. Movie is great! comments are splendid! all actors sing alive! i really-really wish this movie to win some of the greatest awards of the year because it more than deserve this! I play this dvd every evening as a background while I'm using my laptop. I feel that I'm deep in love with this movie and now I realize that I need-need-need a CD with all soundtracks from it. That's what I'm going to order!

0596009208|5.0|This book is extremely helpful for those who wish to learn Java programming fundamentals but require a more entertaining approach. Let's face it, learning any new programming language is tedious at best. Personally I found it a bit too simplistic in some areas and, at times, a little overly distracting. The content of the book accurately reflects it's title and does an excellent job teaching anyone who has some time to be entertained while learning Java programming. In addition, this book provides links to websites which offer many more helpful learning resources. I can highly recommend this book with 5 Stars to it's intended audience.
B000X1Z0BU|2.0|The only reason I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is for some of the music. I did enjoy a few of the original songs, but in no way thought they were Oscar worthy. The movie itself is boring and goes absolutely nowhere. I agree with one other review here when the said \\"I just didn't get it.\\" What was the purpose? I kept thinking it was going to get better and then it just ends...sometimes Once it too much.

B00005JM4Z|3.0|I was truly disappointed after liking the first movie so much.  The effects were still cool though.
B0000CNY27|3.0|Snake Plissken is one of those iconic characters, who everyone knows about, and who everyone loves. Except for me. Until now. I had no idea who Snake Plissken was until ages ago, when someone bought a soft toy snake, and called it Plissken.<br /><br />There's something about Kurt Russell, that makes him fit the anti/reluctant hero role so well, he surpasses himself in this movie, as he was a bit cocky in Big Trouble In Little China, but here, he's mean, he's moody, and he's a bad boy. Perfect guy!<br /><br />In Escape From New York, Plissken has to rescue the president, a guy he really couldn't give a damn about. Air Force One has crashed into Manhattan Island, holding the largest prison, and the President is now trapped, with vital information on his person. Freshly captured, and about to be incarcerated, Plissken is ordered to rescue him, within a time limit of 22-24 hours, and that's that. Lots of fighting, chasing and Kurt looking pretty damn good. It starts off set in the future (but in the past by now!), where in 1997 there were high levels of crime. New York is now a high level prison, where all the toughest criminals are to serve life. It's survival of the fittest inside, with no rules, except what's made by the prisoners, so it's survive or die!<br /><br />The film's quite brisk, and passes by quite quickly. There's literally no scenes in this that deserved to be on the cutting room floor, and it was to the point. No nonsense from the Plissken. The only quibble is that it's dated now - they actually use cassette tapes (how did we EVER manage?), and apart from Kurt's hair (mullets were never a good idea), it feels like it could have been made recently.<br /><br />There's something about Escape From New York, in my opinion, it lacked a certain something. It never really punched me right in the gut. But it was a good movie. With a meagre budget, compared to today's standards, it doesn't look that way.<br /><br />With rumours about this being remade - with Gerard Butler of all actors - I seriously hope it falls through. I wasn't quite sure what all the fuss about Kurt was about until I saw this. This film cannot and should not be remade. Get some original ideas and leave Snake Plissken alone.ope it falls through.

B000LC55F2|4.0|I have now seen all of Christopher Nolan's film, apart from Insomnia (for no other reason than I simply haven't gotten around to it yet), and I must say this does have the distinct Nolan/Pfister (the Director of Cinematography) feel to it. Though that darkness of tone and color is there, which seem to be in all Nolan movies.  The Prestige also flashes from the present, to the past, to the future, which is reminiscent of Memento, but is nowhere near as dizzying as in the latter movie. The heart of the movie is oneupmanship, as it plays like a war between the finest kings in a land, and as human kings, the unintentional happens inevitably.  I got so entangled in this war that by the end of the movie, I was dying to know who would be the victor.  I can only equate the whole feel of the movie oddly with MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch, where with each round it seems so obvious as to who will win. Great performances by Caine, Jackman and Bale.  Everyone's favorite, the beautiful Johansson and her character could have been played by just about anyone in my opinion, but I think it was just the nature of the part. When will she star in a Wes Anderson movie? Or Baumbach? Or another Woody Allen movie? Lastly, was the great Tesla.  The writer's (the Nolan brothers) knew what they were doing when they took on one of the most brilliant and mysterious men ever to live. Nolan mentions in the Special Features, there was only one man that he wanted to play the part, and that man was David Bowie. The Great Bowie is indeed the only one who could play that part off just right. I think there are many of us who have been craving another Bowie appearance in a movie.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|I don't know where I was coming from with the title, it's just something that I thought would capture peoples attention, and if you're reading this then that means it worked. My Chemical Romance broke onto the scene with the album \\"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love.\\" which gained the band a huge underground following which eventually lead to their mainstream success with their second album \\"Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge.\\" Although the band have been regularly labelled as an \\"emo\\" band, lead singer Gerard Way has regularly shot this down, saying that it's a label that people use to stick them with a particular crowd. I happen to agree with this and see MCR as a truly unique band with a unique and powerful sound.<br /><br />The previous two albums where what built MCR up and gave them their international recognition and fanbase, which would eventually lead into the release of The Black Parade, one of their biggest albums to date. Sales figures aren't everything and don't really assure you that the album will have the trademark MCR sound that made them so big. This is truly something different from the band, but doesn't steer away from the emotion and epic ambiance that they have become known for. This has received many criticisms by people saying that the band have sold out by becoming too mainstream, this is again something I disagree with as there's nothing wrong with a band like this gaining mainstream success as it simply brings this excellent style of music to the world and gives them the opportunity to appreciate it like I do.<br /><br />The songs vary in different ways as some start off slow paced and build into something massive and loud, yet some simply blow your mind from the first second of play. Unlike most mainstream music, MCR give us a true message about society in every song and in a sense give you something to think about. Songs such as Blood, Dead & Mama are great tracks, each with their own message.<br /><br />My top 5 from the album are<br /><br />Dead<br />Famous Last Words<br />This Is How I Disappear<br />Mama<br />Welcome To The Black Parade<br /><br />Obviously the other tracks on the album are incredible but it is something that has to be experienced first hand.Last Words  This Is How I Disappear  Mama  Welcome To The Black Parade    Obviously the other tracks on the album are incredible but it is something that has to be experienced first hand.
B0010ZR160|5.0|Dennis Lehane is a great author, and this is a great screenplay. Casey Affleck (he is so much better than his brother) is great in the role of Patrick Kensie. I highly recommend this movie. I can't wait for other Lehane books to make it to the theatre.
B0010X73ZG|4.0|The mist is good throwback to old horror movies, I really enjoyed it. I like Darabont's other two Stephen King adaptations The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile. The Mist has good atmosphere and the scary thing is actually not the mist but how the people react to the events in the store. And the ending will stay with you well after the film is over. I would give it an 8/10.
B0000009RT|5.0|Substitute \\"...if another WHITE TRUCK DRIVER...\\" for \\"...if another woman driver...\\" and you have not the Watts riot '65 but south LA '92 -- the Rodney King riots. \\"Trouble Every Day\\" has stayed with me all this time. My band covered it, believe it or not, with that one update. It still sounds good on my sound check tapes.     \\"Mr America, walk on by your liquor store supreme...\\" Has anything changed?     It is difficult to take Zappa at face value when he says he was only in it for the money, so he could make the music he really wanted, string quartets, in his basement.
B00005JNDZ|2.0|I loved the first book and thought the first movie was fairly well done so I was excited when I heard they were going to make a movie from the next book as well. Unfortunately this one wasn't as true to the book or as good BY FAR. If you've read the book don't ruin it by watching this.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I adore these headphones.  I have a number of issues when it comes to finding headphones I like.      Firstly, I'm a distance runner so I need headphones that will stay in my ears for a long period of time.  I hate having to fidget with headphones during a run so the more stable the better.  Secondly, I have tiny ears which normal ear buds tend to fall out of.      I've tried many different types of headphones but I keep coming back to these.  I first got these headphones (or this style) probably 10 years ago with my CD player and I have yet to find a pair that better stay on my head and in my ears.  The sound quality is great for what I use them for.  Also, they are pretty resistant to sweat and weathering.
0743486285|5.0|As a recovered heroin addict myself, I found this book to be horrifyingly real. Not only did it touch upon the disgusting reality that is sticking a needle in your arm, but tt also touches on what happens to those around you. Drug abuse and addiction harms more then just yourself. I feel that this book is a beautiful yet necessary grotesque way of encouraging me and others to stay sober.
B000001EC1|5.0|My favorite music when driving my Mustang with the top down on a cool spring day.
0312379293|4.0|The novel is engaging as I found Danny Cartwright more likable and accessible than Edmond Dantes from Dumas classic The Count of Monte Cristo. There are several devices to tie up the complex plot in A Prisoner of Birth (as a previous reviewer mentions) but then again in the Dumas classic there are several items that make the story go that strain credibility (that a prisoner can make medication, tools, and ink in his cell). A certain amount of this stuff is necessary to make the plot go. The fact that Cartwright can take a plea is pure modern times. Nice touch. The ending is riveting as Cartwright doen't completely blindside his enemies, and ruin them via  his wealth and the power that brings [as Dantes does].  I loved Dumas' clasic and enjoyed this as well.

I am a fan of Stargate SG1 and had pre ordered The Ark of Truth i wasn't disappointed it is a visual feast, fantastic effects, beautiful scenery,  terrific cast and a great conclusion to season 10.  Be prepared for a fuller richer adventure with SG1. All the SG1 team is there happy to see there was no casualties from the series ending. Especially enjoyed  the special features Comic-Con. Thank you Robert Cooper and Brad Wright i hope you produce many more quality 2 hour SG1 movies i will be buying everyone and enjoying the adventures of SG1.   I am not going to give the story away read another reviewers comments if you are a fan you won't be disappointed.
B0012K1ILW|4.0|First off, i have many of Badu's CDs..she is not a follower.  Love her voice and artists that contribute musically on her CDS.  In particular for this album i like those tracks that are produced by Madlib(The Healer/My People), her tribute to JDilla is beautiful as well and Honey produced by 9th Wonder is good.  All around I recommend it, listen to it a few times...
1594489505|3.0|For me, \\"The Kite Runner\\" was a well-written piece of literary art.  There was no doubt it took much time and effort.  My impression reading \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" was that it was more hastily put together, perhaps to take advantage of the spotlight \\"Kite\\" was enjoying, in order to promote awareness of a very important issue.  While the book didn't work, for me, as a great read, it was compelling and emotional and brought me to tears several times.  I want to reach out and do what I can for these women.  In that, Hosseini is very successful and I hope that his work has encouraged many to make a difference, and give generously, to organizations that support refugees and women.  In America, we are spared the violence of war.  This was an eye-opening reminder that this is still happening in our lifetime.  We remember the horrors of the Holocaust--but this is still a reality.
B00025ETIW|4.0|...now I like my ambient abstract and bizarre music that doesn't follow a distinct structure...from mathcore to pure ambient sounds I've normally avoided music that follows any simple structure unless it has something new to offer...I can't really say this has anything new to offer...and that's why it bothers me to say...I like it...    ...my brother asked for this album for christmas (of course him being of a rather young age it was unexpected) and then I listened to this when he did...the stand out tracks standed out as much as they should (the obvious singles: Helena, I'm not Okay, Ghost of you) and the rest blended in with the verse, chorus, maybe if we're lucky a guitar solo done reasonably well...after a few listens yes it did grow on me but if anything what irritates me most is this attack on emo stereotypes with them seeming to be the crusade leaders of this genre...THIS IS NOT WHERE EMO STARTED!!! Yes they are probably the leaders of the new emo fad but real emo started with Rites of Spring, Fugazi, and Sunny Day Real Estate....yes the sound has changed to a more hardcore sound then it did before but for that you have At the Drive-in...but anyway I don't like this album enough to give it a track by track review...my personal favourite is thank you for the venom regardless of how gerrard ways voice can get annoying after a few listens...lets just say if you like this so called \\"Emo\\" and want to find a place to start...then be my guest and start here but I tell you there's much better out there (Finch? Perhaps?)
B00000DCHE|5.0|These are songs you don't hear on the radio, and maybe never did - except perhaps for Piano Man.  This is Joel at his best, in front of an audience and before he got too big for his own britches.  If you only ever buy one Billy Joel cd, buy this one.
B0012K1ILW|2.0|I would have given this album a better rating, but there are songs with explicit words being used and I personally do not appreciate the fact that there is no explicit warning.

B000006TSC|4.0|Luis Mejia (son) - Breathless album results quite confusing for Camel; here, the sound is still original and quite progressive but goes farther into a light style, even close to pop, but the main reason is for the band to become at least a bit noticed in media apart from cult fans, although the hard efforts where vane, as the album went nowhere on charts. So a prog band makes a light album, it wasn't the first time it happens, but the colateral results? Peter Bardens, in my consideration the most inventive and original keyboardist by that times of fame in prog,wents out of the band because of songwritng differences with Latimer. Still, this may seem as any excuse for Breathless to be a bad album, but its far from it, still the sound and songs are very even and yet favourable, as Camel never let us down:     The introducing title track is as sweet as innocent but distinctive as a rock ballad should be, the acoustic guitar riffs are infectious, and the tickling of the rest instrumentation gets to be delightful; \\"Echoes\\", this is the most reocognizable prog song in the album, and being fast paced and with a soothing guitar, its nothing but refreshing. \\"Down On The Farm\\" takes you to the most humble farm in the world, and with its simplistic meaning and magestic instrumentation, it is for me the best song captivating the farm-like way of life, while \\"Summer Lightning\\" is a post disco style of music which is nothing but delightful, memorable and works as the perfect atmosphere. \\"You Make Me Smile\\" has the perfect rythm and tunes. Finally, \\"Rainbow's End\\" is such a beautiful and tearful ballad that makes me cry the way Latimer sings it. Nothing further, the works on Breathless are emotionally captivating, perfectly set, and wonderfully arranged, still rocking and with that jazz-fussion touch of versality that Camel always possess, but yet, as a severe prog band, it gets as the same case as Blondie's infamous disco song, as a disco song its adorable, but who will prise thesevere New Wave band song as one of their bests? almost none. The remains of why you should buy this album is to experience one of this bands most touching periods, the music for the first time has a big soul, but just don´t expect that harsh side of instrumentalism and progressive rock pride they used to always show.
0307394549|5.0|I purchased Martha's special cookie magazine at Christmas a few years back, and it's simply falling apart now because I've made her cookies again and again. I was excited to see this book as a lot of my favorites from the cookie mag are included and the protective book allows me to keep these yummy recipes in one safe place. The photos are stunning - there's a pictorial table of contents (very unique!) based on things like 'soft and chewy' and 'crisp and crunchy'  and there's even a delightful section in the back that shows you how to package your cookies for gifting. I simply can't wait to try the all the recipes!
0671027344|2.0|Perks of Being a Wallflower is an extremely over-hyped book. Sure, it had its parts but the way people talked about it you'd think it was the Bible or something. Some parts were funny, but other parts I just didn't get. I don't think that it is an accurate portrayal of adolescence. Another thing that bothered me about this book was that sometimes the situations Charlie gets himself into are so embarrassing that you yourself feel embarrassed for him. I've also seen that the people who tend to read/like this book aren't very well read. This book is not equal to those of literary merit by any standards.
B000001ESP|5.0|MOVING PICTURES is the second installment in Rush's ultimate 80s trilogy of forward-thinking progressive rock albums. Slightly darker in tone than PERMANENT WAVES, this CD finds bassist-singer Geddy Lee exploring his lower range even more than its predecessor did, although he still sings in a high voice on songs like \\"Tom Sawyer\\", a commentary on the nature of the male gender and how men can be tempted to push themselves, and others, too hard. \\"Limelight\\", on the other hand, is about stardom and how it affects those who achieve it, leading to them demanding attention even from those who can't give it due to attention disorders. This album will leave you thinking for days about what its lyrics mean.
0385338724|3.0|In Sophie Kinsella's \\"Remember Me?,\\" Lexi Smart woke up one day in 2007 and realized that she did not remember anything the events for the last three years. Her last recollection was the night before her father's funeral in 2004. The Lexi in 2004 had frizzy hair and crooked teeth, and was stood up by someone named Loser Dave. She was unambitious but popular with her friends. Lexi discovered that in 2007, she was a director at the carpet company she worked at, and she was married to a highly successful and gorgeous man named Eric. Initially, Lexi was extremely happy that her life worked out that way but soon discovered that it was not the way it seemed.    This was an okay book for me. I was a little disappointed because I have high expectations of Sophie Kinsella as her work has been just splendid so far. \\"Remember Me?\\" was quite average for me and I found that it lacked wit and humor which was I expected from the author. That being said, this was a quick read and it has its sort-of-funny moments with a rather unoriginal plot. That being said, I still look forward to her next book.
0452289963|2.0|I know that everybody knows that it is not possible to create a new earth...Mars is too cold, Venus is too hot, but Ecky Tolle lets us into a fresh way to interpret the old/current earth.<br />Things like slow down, calm down, relax and calm down are all suggestions that he makes.  For me this is tough, because if I slow down I will probably lose my job.<br />Perhaps this book is better for people who have time to follow his steps.  All to say, it is really good, and someday I really hope to nail all of my life's purpose by awakening.<br />It would be interesting to see how this book would apply in war stricken or poverty stricken areas...I don't think it could.<br />Anyways, this book is really good, and while I am having a hard time applying the lessons,or seeing how they apply, they are very intelligent and very well written.

B000UVLK1M|5.0|Ok, all the rest comes further down, but here is the cut: Listen to this, if you can, without judgement, without a thought, because by the time you get to track eight, you are going to be starry eyed. Somehow, Hancock does it again. I wanted this CD to be another Gershwin's world, and it certainly isn't, even though Joni sang two songs on that CD. This is different. This is Joni's world. It's subtle, textured, and when you realize what a great Jazz talent Joni is, in addition to being the composer of all these textured story-songs and chordal motifs, you'll say \\"Why didn't somebody do this sooner?\\"<br /><br />Well, because Herbie had to do it, and didn't get around to it until now.<br /><br />I've got the 10 track CD, with 4 vocal tracks, four instrumental, and one spoken poetry-lyrics track. Tina Turner, Norah Jones, Joni Mitchell and Corinne Bailey Rae are the singers. Herbie heads up a jazz quintet that would smooth out your most wrinkled pair of socks. More later. I've got to go hear it again...

0399152717|1.0|The subject matter of Polar Shift promised scientific intrigue and a storyline full of techno-thrills. What the novel delivered was a hodge-podge of gappy scientific reasoning, implausible circumstances, repetitive phrasing, random romance, excruciatingly over-detailed descriptions of alcoholic consumption, and excruciatingly under-developed stereotypical characters. (How often can one heroine be called `beautiful and intelligent' before the first piece of evidence is presented to make the case? Answer: 32 and still counting.)    As a vehicle for learning anything about polar shift, I think the book exhibited just enough research to be dangerous. If a magnetic shift really can cause geological shift of plate tectonics - which seems unlikely but perhaps there is some scientific merit here - how does this occur? How would an `antidote' work? Is it through wave cancellation? If so, why not go down that path a little further, both to be informative and to help the plausibility of the plot line? And what of the code/cipher nonsense that housed the critical Kovacs equations in a nursery rhyme? (What ARE these equations? I thought they were frequencies.) Either explain the code fully or not at all, but please spare the half-hearted attempt at a dialog-based explanation of ciphers and code-breaking that gets wrapped up prematurely by our hero's, \\"Are you saying what I think you're saying?\\"    So if Paul Kemprecos is, in fact, the ghost writer for this book, it feels a bit disingenuous. Is this true and does it explain why such a touted writer as Clive Cussler would have produced (or merely signed off on) such a tour-de-farce? Can anyone rise to Cussler's defense before I resign to this being the first and last book of his I will ever read?
B0012Q94QW|3.0|I didn't have any high expectations for this film, so enjoyed it.  There are plenty of worse ways to spend a couple of hours.  The special effects were satisfactory.  (Excepting the sabre-tooth tiger, of course - I have to agree  with another reviewer that CGI just cannot do cats yet, much less large cats.  Still, acceptable though.)    I did like to velociraptor-like giant chickens / dodoes / whatever - very large man-eating birds are scary AND cool!    The non-specific geographic location and lack of time orientation were disappointing, though.  Another reviewer remarked that they weren't sure if it took days, weeks, months, or years.  From what I could tell, the whole story only took, like, four or five days!  That's a lot of hiking, man!    Overall - okay.  I'll buy it when on clearance next year :)
0321544080|2.0|I thought this was the most entertaining read for a book on photography, I laughed out loud several times. The stories are great. But if you are looking for shooting information camera settings, lighting ratio's etc.. you should look elsewhere. I was hoping for a little more information based on all the hype this book received. I think the Kelby marketing machine is in overdrive on this one.
B0012RCMH4|5.0|Outstanding release containing legendary 1983 demos 'Satanic Rites' and 'Triumph of Death'<br /><br />Disc 1 is the real treasure [Satanic Rites] By this point Hellhammer was about as good as they ever were gonna get. This is basically a full-length Hellhammer album containing such familiar classics as 'Third of the Storms' 'Messiah' 'Revelations of Doom' and an amazing rendition of \\"Triumph of Death\\"<br /><br />'Triumph' is not the only Hellhammer epic however, as there are two other songs that clock over the 6-minute mark. 'Satanic Rites' and 'Buried and Forgotten' which is an early version of \\"Necromantical Screams\\"<br /><br />If you thought Apocalyptic Raids was too short, then definitely check out this release!<br /><br />+ADD THIS TO YOUR COLLECTION+<br /><br />P.S It is also worth mentioning the infamous black metal band MAYHEM borrowed quite a few Hellhammer songs titles for use as their pseudonyms:<br /><br />Members of Mayhem:<br /><br />Euronymous-Guitar<br /><br />Messiah-Vocals<br /><br />Maniac-Vocals<br /><br />Hellhammer-Drums<br /><br />and on \\"Live in Leipzig\\" I'm pretty sure Dead tells the audience \\"Only Death is Real!\\"
B00000DCHI|5.0|This dual CD set contains some of the most well-known (and well-loved) Billy Joel hits from his heyday (during the 1970s and 1980s).  Though, he still continues on today, many of the tunes featured here really defined his career during that time.  They include his signature song, the soulful and bittersweet \\"Piano Man,\\" \\"New York State of Mind,\\" \\"Just The Way You Are,\\" and the infectious \\"Only the Good Die Young.\\"  And that's just disc one.  Disc two includes \\"My Life\\" (for me, this will always be remembered as the theme song to \\"Bosom Buddies\\") and \\"She's Got a Way.\\"  Whenever I hear this music it really settles my nerves, makes me feel good to be alive and gives me a perspective on the curve balls that life throws at me.  I think you'll feel the same.  This definitely should be a part of your CD collection.......
B000086EOE|5.0|Matthew-              If you haven't checked out the site Prog Archives, I recommend that you do. You should be able to find some answers there. They've got a great site with a lot of cool music represented from all over the world. I obviously don't know if it's your cup-of-tea but, give the 70's Italian Symphonic Prog a try-it's some really good stuff! Banco...,PFM and le Orme to mention the main groups although there are some great one hit wonders as well like Locanda... (a favorite of mine-as with the best of the first three groups mentioned) and Reale..., et al. Well good luck and I hope this helps.
0452289963|5.0|This has to be the best book, beside the Bible, that I have ever read.  Learning about your ego and how it affects your life has been an awakening experience.  I highly recommend this to everyone.    Cherie Young
B000K15VSA|5.0|I OWN THE THE SD DVD VERSION AND PLAN TO BUY THE BLUE RAY.    THE SD VERSION IS EXCELLENT
B0002234LS|5.0|The movie is creepy and good.John Turturro did a good job playing Shooter.The strange twists and turns in the story were good.Timothy Hutton was also fantastic.And the ending,shocking and surprising.
B000V6U7CY|5.0|I know it's a matter of taste but this recording is so alive and refreshing. Yeah, it's not on period instruments and there are some other really good interpretations out there that you may feel are better. BUT! how can you listen to this and deny it's beauty? Perhaps it's too unconventional. But therein lies the beauty of it. Even if it's unique doesn't make it inferior. Quite the contrary.     Anne-Sophie Mutter plays with grace and vivid expression. The Trondheim Soloists support her like true friends. Even if one argues that it's not true to form, it still is fabulously played in my book.  I love it and am proud to keep it in my library along with two or three other fine interpretations of Vivaldi's: The Four Seasons.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|You have to get this movie, This is a British comedy, It is off the wall funny! Worth every penny!
0385338724|4.0|THIS IS A GREAT BOOK!  IT WAS VERY HARD TO PUT DOWN.  IT TAKES YOU FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.  YOU WOULDN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS PURCHASE.
0765318741|4.0|It is completely different from the movie and just as good. I recommend you see the movie and then read the book. You'll be really surprised.
0440241413|1.0|She is superficial, flighty, has no self control, no self restraint, and no discipline.  She lies constantly.  She has no work ethic.  She cheats her employer.  When she brings a sandwich to work for lunch and eats it in 5 minutes, she looks for other things to do rather than get back to work.  Since she does other personal things on other company time, I felt it would be honorable of her to give back a little time to the company when she took a short lunch, but no, that would never occur to her.  It is hard to enjoy reading about someone I dislike so much.  I couldn't believe Luke could find anything about her to like.<br /><br />The main character, Emma, in another book by this author (\\"Can You Keep a Secret\\") was very similar to Rebecca.  I didn't like Emma either, but I did like \\"Can You Keep a Secret\\" because of the guy, Jack, and the hilarious interaction between him and Emma.  Jack asked Emma questions in front of other people and as she answered the questions with lies, she knew that he knew she was lying.  Unfortunately I didn't find similar or any humor in \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic.\\".<br /><br />Sexual content: none.  Setting: 1997 to 2000 London.  Copyright: 2001.  Genre: chick lit.<br /><br />For a list of my reviews of other Sophie Kinsella books, see my 5 star review of \\"Can You Keep a Secret\\" posted 2/21/07.
B00005JPOO|5.0|I just don't get it. Actually I do. I understand perfectly why a gem of a movie like this is not well liked by many critics. Gone are the days when a nice story that let you escape from the crazy world was okay. Now days if a movie isn't \\"realistic\\" enough then it's not worth seeing. What is up with that? I don't know about others but I like to go to movies to ESCAPE reality for awhile. Leave behind the stresses in my own life and let a story of some little happily ever after take me on a journey that will leave me with a smile.     This wonderful movie and it's many reviews only reaffirms what I've long ago discovered and accepted. If the critics thinks it's not worth the film it's recorded on then I'll probably love it. Such is the case with Penelope. In fact, the less than rave reviews by many only made me want to see it more and I wasn't disappointed.    Not only do I pretty much never agree with the critics but I now more than every have very little faith in the profession as a whole. It really comes down to the fact that a movie review is merely an opinion. An opinion that not everyone shares and therefore only counts for so much. A critic does not necessarily like all genre's of movies in which case if they aren't a chick flick kind of person then of course their review is going to be less than stellar.  Whatever.    In a wonderful *Fantasy* world (fantasy being the key word, people) that's reminiscent of Pushing Daisies (thought technically this one came first) a young woman named Penelope finds happiness and peace with the trials life has dealt her and when it's all said and done she learns loving yourself as you are is enough, but you can still get your prince in tarnished armor in the end as well.    I thought this movie was everything wonderful. The story, the sets, the costumes and the performances by an amazing cast left me grinning like a fool every time I left the theater. I'm growing less tolerant for a lot of the garbage floating around these daysso when I find a movie like this or Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium that has a wonderful story and remains refreshingly clean I can't help but love it and want to see it again and again. I love the soundtrack, I can't wait for the DVD and I suppose those who don't like it, it's just their loss. I myself can't stand horror flicks. So to each his or her own.
B00002MZ2C|4.0|Why is it that all the negative, one-star ratings of this album rant about its anti-capitalist messages and fail to discuss - um - the music?     Solid, rocking angry music. Yes, it is political - and not everyone's gonna agree with the politics - but then imagine political rock that was in favour of the system... it would be boring.     Listen to this album and decide for yourself...
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|Cate Blanchett is spectacular as Queen Elizabeth I.  The film is loaded with style, story, history and a magnificent splendor not seen of late.  Admittedly, it is a triffle difficult task to create a film that is altogether historic, accurate, precise in detail and entertaining for those who don't appreciate the history and accuracy and detail.  Some detail must be left on the cutting room floor and a broad brush must therefore paint the intricate picture of who's who and whyfore.  But this film is balanced in this regard, almost perfectly balanced in this regard.  It is an art film to be sure, and a beautiful masterful art film at that.  Geoffrey Rush as the senior advisor and confident of the queen, is reprised in the role of Francis Wallsingham, the eyes and ears of all things secret.  Clive Owen is very good as Walter Raleigh, perhaps a bit much of a romantic than historical, but placed well within the story line and effective as an element of cohesion between the plots and the actual events.  Cate Blanchett is the greatest actress since Bette Davis and a true 'star' of the screen.  Her portrayal of Elizabeth is breathless perfection.  One is immediately endeared to the queen in both as a part of history and as a deep person of greatest inner strength and womanhood.  (Bette Davis and Cate Blanchett played the same role, years apart, and both are supreme.)    The digital effects are necessary and beautifully accomplished, yet not overdone as in most epic films.  The scene near the end where Elizabeth is standing upon a rock at the sea's edge watching the destruction of the Armada ranks with the best in any film of any time.    I would love to see a third film someday about the reign of the queen in later years with Cate Blanchett in the role.  I would never tire of seeing her.    Excellent, supreme masterpiece this is that the entire family could enjoy.  Any violence is non-gratuitous and germaine to the story.  It is a clean film by today's standards.  It is a love story yes, but more of a story of courage and determination to overcome fear and prevail in the face of what could have been certain destruction for England.
B000002UAX|5.0|MY favorite song is Goodnight and it will be the lullaby I will be singing to my grandchildren. That song just touches my soul. Sadly it is only on this album, and unless you have this it goes unheard. There is great music  on this album I have to say that this is my favorite and I have a lot of Beatle music.
B000002AOD|5.0|Great compositions (and piano playing) from Michel Camilo, as well as fantastic horn arrangements, which really show off the A-list NYC studio cats on the session.  If you enjoy trumpets, you'll love this CD.  It features amazing lead trumpet work from Jon Faddis, a great solo by Michael Mossman, and rock solid section work from Stanton Davis, Bryan Lynch, and Ryan Kisor.  Superb sax solos from Ralph Bowen, Paquito d'Rivera and Chris Hunter, and an A-list trombone section (David Bargeron, Ed Neumeister, Conrad Herwig, Douglas Purviance and David Taylor).  Also a really high quality recording, a great demo disk for a high end stereo system.
1400079179|5.0|The Davinci Code is one of those great books that gives the reader so much information... conspiracy, suspense, religious context, probes questions, visual problems, etc. There is no question that this is an amazing book and that is why it was produced into a movie.<br /><br />If these subjects interest you, then I highly recommend the following book as this goes deeper and is more truthful on questions surrounding religion: \\"HOW JESUS BECAME CHRISTIAN\\" by Barrie Wilson, PhD.<br /><br />In \\"How Jesus Became Christian\\" similar controversy is raised surrounding religion but it is presented as fact in a historical context. Barrie Wilson's book asks the question, \\"How did a Torah-observant Jew become a gentile son of G-d and the leader of Christianity - a religion that he would not recognize if he were alive today?\\"<br /><br />Both great books. Both books ask tough questions about our understanding of religion.
B0010V4TZU|5.0|This is the post-Indie, post-Belle and Sebastian, post-Decemberists, post-New Pornographers album I've been waiting for.  Get it now!  You won't be sorry. A perfect entre into spring.
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|i saw Gattaca back when it was first released in 1997... more than ten years later, it still stands as my favorite film of all time.  I bought the DVD when it came out and i have watched it several times since and never tired of it. Now I am very excited to receive my bluray copy. Heck, this film was the reason I sided with Bluray over HD-DVD!  Glad I made the right choice!
B000002U9Y|5.0|Pink Floyd sure were incredibly strange back in the pre-Dark Side of the Moon days.  They weren't afraid to experiment with their sound and style, even if it meant giving listeners the creeps!  Sometimes the album focuses more on atmosphere and lets us search for the vocal melodies behind many interesting and creative musical ideas.      I absolutely love \\"Let There Be More Light\\".  The speedy psychedelic introduction that builds to a catchy verse melody and highly unusual yet comforting chorus.  LOVE this song.      Now let's talk about the title song.  I have a friend who refuses to listen to this song, despite how much he loves Pink Floyd because it puts bad pictures in his head.  I can totally see why.  Listening to the song this afternoon I was totally caught up in the quiet atmospheric parts in the beginning of the song.  That wasn't the only fantastic thing about it.      The drums came along and while they play a really nice pattern, they were able to put me in very dreamy state that NO drumming has ever been able to do before on ANY other rock record.  Come on, it's drumming!  How can it be possible for a guy playing on a drum kit to move a listener all by itself?  I have no idea how, but it did.    After that, the drumming got really hectic and out of control, while changing from a moody drumming pattern to a more uncontrollable and outrageous style (or to put it simply, messy as heck).  Then came along either keyboards or organs and that totally changed the entire feeling I originally had.  Now it feels like an evil presence is around me, whereas in the beginning of the song I could sense something was wrong and my life was about to be temporarily hypnotized.  The evil is real, and now it's right in front of me the way the vocals and the instruments get all spaced out and extreme as can be.  It makes the whole experience very confusing to me.  A VERY eerie song.    There's other songs on the album that have solid melodies, and these would be more fun, playful tunes.
B000E1ZK50|4.0|I just don't understand people.  This movie is a lot of fun and has very cool visual effects.  I am not even going to mention that just the fact Kate Beckinsale is in it is worth seeing and buying this flick.  Why are there so many naysayers in this world?  People who just love to hate everything.  I can understand if this type of movie is not your cup of tea if that's the case then don't see it.  But if your into this kind of stuff then watch it and have fun!  Anyhow, check it out if you like monsters, action and cool effects. Oh did I mention KATE BECKINSALE is in it?
B0010YSD7M|5.0|As we have been SG1 Fans for over 6 years, we were so angry at SCI FI channel for their stupidity in canceling it that words could not express my opinion without being crass.<br /><br />KUDOS to MGM.  This is an excellent finish to the Ori story arc.  The DVD extras are great, too.<br /><br />If you are not a Stargate fan and wondering about it, this has an excellent \\"prelude\\" section that will quickly bring you up to speed.<br /><br />Well worth the cost.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This was some of the best tv I've watched in a while. Was hooked from the start. Would bring my laptop to bed with me at night and watch 2-3 episodes from bed, before going to sleep. Made for some interesting nightmares. :)
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|The Wall has to be the strangest and most amazing movie I've ever seen. I saw it the first time with a few friends when I was in highschool and never forgot about it - I knew I had to have it. I tried to find it in stores and *if* I could find it, the price tag was usually in the ballpark of $30. So I finally looked on Amazon.com and found this one on sale for less than $15 - I snatched it up immediately. The movie itself is indescribable - you just have to see it for yourself. It's a look into a disturbed mind that goes beyond anything else you've ever seen. There's not much of a linear storyline, it's more like... a music video for an entire album. It's absolutely insane and you have to see it to believe it. If you like Pink Floyd, you must see this film. Period. The animated portions of this movie are absolutely insane. Buy this movie!
B000000WA4|5.0|Mellon Collie is a beautifully written masterpiece in my opinion.  Of course, I simply adore the pumpkins.  I find the album itself can satisfy a vast array a different music \\"moods\\" and left me with a number of songs I could identify with at that specific time in my life.  For those who say it doesn't compare to Siamese Dream:  While I admit Siamese Dream was a masterpiece, I see no decline with mellon collie-just difference.  It was still the beautiful pumpkins music I knew I loved (which is more than I can say now in 2008). Anyway---Beautiful Album*****
B00008LDPU|5.0|Personally, I didn't really like the movie The Matrix, so I was skeptical when I heard about this collection of short films. The idea behind The Matrix always appealed to me, but other than that, I didn't enjoy it. But when I saw the Animatrix the first time, I was hooked. It's a collection of beautifully animated (and computer animated) shorts that are based on the idea behind The Matrix. Each short is independent of the other (except for one that has two parts) and they are all amazing. You have to see it for yourself. Don't watch this with expectations, and make sure you pay attention. I would say this DVD is probably best for ages 15 and up.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|this was i think my introduction to jane austen films.  i had always thought them frilly, overly mannered, and just way too girly..  my sister was aghast and lent me her five hour bbc pride and prejudice and persuasion.  mansfield park came third in line.     while the pride and prejudice was lovely and beautiful, i completely swooned over persuasion.    true that the actors aren't overly attractive.  but as the film goes on, hinds becomes handsome and desirable because we see him through Anne's eyes.  Anne, who is plain and not overly attractive, goes through the same metamorphosis.     the acting is subtle, measured, deliberate.  we ache, yearn,and love with these characters.  it speaks to the love of that we have lost, that we have given up on, resigned to being alone...  it is a modern fairy tale, a love story for grown ups.      the film is beautiful in scenery, music, everything. i never tire of watching it.  it remains my favorite  jane austen i have seen yet,though the new pride and prejudice with keira knightly, the non masterpiece theatre mansfield park are very very closely behind this film.        i did see some of the new persuasion done on masterpiece theatre and was automatically put off by the blonde surfer dude captain wentworth.  it didn't have the same beauty and majesty as this version.       this is beautiful.....
0066620996|4.0|My bosses boss loves this and I was made to read it as part of my annual P-928.  I read it on the plane over to Rome from Detroit and it was a good solid read.  Its a well documented research study on companies who were average performers who then had 15 years of sustained 2.5 or 3x stock market performance.  I did appreciate the explanations as to the choices the researchers made and why.  Nevertheless, it seems to be more for middle level managers and above given that the main thesis appears to be you want a work horse CEO and not a show boat as well as one who digs down into what their company can do best and then drags the company through his dogeddness and sheer will into makeing any and all changes necessary to pursue that goal.
B000BMSTMS|3.0|I have been an avid korn listener for years. Their Music is great. Korn has gone very mainstream and now I believe that they do not like making music that talks of sex, drugs and good old rock and roll. Korn used to mean something man. Getting all your hatred out. Songs of 3 day speed binges. Songs of killing and other stuff that made korn unique. Now with See You on the Other Side. They are talking about Politics and other dumb crap. Dont even get me started on how bad korn is selling out with Ballsville. Korn needs to go back to the basics. Back to the anger hate and frustration. They need to slap these fake listeners in the face and make them say \\"Wow tho are these freaks\\". I Love korn and think their the greatest band around. If Youre getting in to korn kids all I have to say is start all the way back from 1994. All the cds from 1994 to 2003 are really tight. See you on the other side is okay i guess but if you want the true korn. Older the better.
B00140PK6O|5.0|I ordered this from Amazon UK to be able to view this prior to its release date.  I was not disappointed! Sadly, I had to watch it by myself because my husband didn't think he'd like it.  He would have been wrong, by the way. It was exquisite in every way.<br /><br />I watched it over 2 nights. It's a 5 hour miniseries and it is broken up into five 1 hour-long episodes.<br /><br />The first 3 hours were very very good. Excellent, even.  But the last 2 hours were absolutely perfect.<br /><br />In Cranford, we meet many of its residents with most of the focus on 2 spinster sisters and their surrounding friends and relatives.  Everyone is kind here and look out for their neighbors and generally want to live correctly and do the right thing.  Their village has been like this for ages and the citizens have all known eachother since birth. It is an idyllic place and a happy place.  They welcome new residents, too, with every bit of friendliness.<br /><br />Cranford has existed in the same way for years, even though times are changing. A railroad may come through the town and most residents are against this type of change. For with the positive changes-- such as information, goods, and knowledge, there would also be negative changes-- more transients, less safety, etc.<br /><br />The intertwined story lines here involve the two sisters, class distinctions, entitlements and expectations, a very funny love triangle, and accepting change and modernity.<br /><br />One of the best stories involves the young son of a poacher (one who kills animals on others' land).  The manager of the aristocrat's large estate takes the young boy under his wing and wants to teach him to read and write.  The aristocratic Lady finds out and believes that those of this underclass should not attempt to learn skills outside their \\"class\\".  Maybe worse, the boy's father finds out of the boy's desire to read and also disapproves.  We find out later that the Lady isn't cold-hearted. On the contrary.  She's kind-hearted and full of pain, yet it's difficult for her to recognize the times are changing and that some of her ways must change, too.<br /><br />When a new handsome doctor moves to town, he immediately falls for Sophy.  Sophy returns his admiration, yet so do 2 others who misunderstand his general kindness for more romantic intentions.  This culminates in expected confusion, but the outcome is happy at the end.<br /><br />Those watching Cranford from the beginning may take it to be an old-fashioned chick-flick.  It's really not, though.  It does focus on the women of Cranford more than the men, but the stories depicted cross gender lines.  Change-- industrialization-- is the antagonist here, along with fear of change.  However, as new medical practices save several lives, and a member of the trade class saves a member of the Upper class, it's also obvious that change, by itself, isn't bad.  It can be positive for everyone involved.<br /><br />This is a fantastic series.  The only disappointment was that it was only five hours! I definitely could have watched another few episodes with the same interest these five held.  Beautifully acted, filmed, and scored.  The entire film was thoroughly enjoyable.s difficult for her to recognize the times are changing and that some of her ways must change, too.

B0011ZNAIC|1.0|This marks the first time Dreamworks animation has let me down. I believe the purpose of fictional films is to have people 'temporarily suspend their disbelief,' but in this film, things just went from unbelievable to ludicrous. The movie would've been fine if it had followed the idea of Barry's wish to fly and explore or whatever, to rebel against the natural order of bees. At first, I thought the film was heading in a similar plot line to Antz which I thought would've been lazy, but after watching the film all the way through, I think following such a plot would've been better off. What I really disliked about this movie's structure is its quick jump away from a sensible plot. Out of impulse, Barry decides to go gather pollen. I found it odd that none of the bees questioned this 'unnatural' behavior and the flyers that appeared to be the 'bully' type in an earlier scene never really follow through on their supposed character. In fact that whole scene with Barry lying to the girl bees about his flying experience should have been deleted as it added nothing to the plot. Next comes a plot involving Barry falling in love with a human woman; bad? yes! Still, the plot changes again for the worst when Barry who apparently knows about coffee, learns that humans are selling honey in stores. Now he boldly states that he plans to sue the human race; ridiculous? Yes! At this point, I told myself, OK, this bee is just making a rash claim. Sadly, I was wrong; not only does he follow through, but his human friend actually helps him and what's more, the humans actually do have a trial for this bee. Suddenly it is perfectly natural for a bee to talk and sue people. Another note I'd like to make is how simple they make it for bees to talk to humans. All they have to do is address them, no clever explanation as to why they avoid talking to humans or how they came to learn the English language never mind the fact that they should really have to shout to be heard with such tiny bodies. Now I understand the movie's fictional and with that I can forgive some unbelievable events presented in the movie, but there is a limit as to how far I will accept it. That point was reached when they held trial for the bee and it was crossed by a mile when a group of bees managed to lift a plane. From the beginning of the whole lawsuit and onwards I kept telling myself that the bee was dreaming all of this nonsense and would wake up eventually... he never woke up. Even a kid's movie should have some credible story structure to capture an audience without them scoffing and muttering 'ludicrous' or 'completely unbelievable.' This movie was just a bunch of nonsense. I have heard great things about Seinfeld, but this movie is hands down the worst Dreamworks animation I've seen. So, to conclude, if you're looking for a movie with a story similar to Antz or A Bug's Life, do not choose this film for there is no real story, just a bunch of nonsense. However, if you like nonsense, this is right up your alley.
B000ADWDF2|5.0|While I stumbled upon this wonderful movie because I was looking for other movies with Connie Nielsen, I can only agree with other reviewers.  The movie is everything they say it is and more.  As a veteran who served and has spent time in VA hospitals, I can tell you this movie hit home.<br /><br />My only wish is that the movie would come out in an English dubbed version so that the movie might garner greater exposure to the general public.  If more people saw this movie they would by sheer exposure learn something about the realities of Afghanistan/Middle East politics and their effects on all humans lives.<br /><br />Update--1 July 2008: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.

B0012BTBQU|3.0|I've freshly completed the current installments of GRR Martin's A Song of Fire and Ice.    My very first impressions of this book(after the first 300 pages) are that the dialogue is so unnatural and unrealistic.  Vin, a 16 year old street-rat, speaks with the tone and vocabulary of someone well educated and versed in language.  The Skaa elders in the very first few chapters also come to mind.  Slaves with no formal education at all?  I've put the book down many times just for this very reason.    I can continue by scrutinising character behavior but I don't think I've read far enough to be able to give a valid opinion.    Pros: Interesting World.        Original and innovative magic system.    Cons: Dialogue.
B00003CX5P|2.0|So, this review is long-overdue, and I'm sure it's been said before:    Why did Mr. Lucas have to take, what started out as a well acted, fun series, and prequel it with this garbage?      First of all, I should say that Liam Neeson and Ewan McGreggor were excellent in this film.  Darth Maul was an ultra cool villain.  The graphics were quite cool, and probably cutting edge.  However...    1) Jar Jar Binks might be one of the biggest mistakes in recent memory.  I think GL was trying to recapture a Chewbacca-like character..... but FAILED MISERABLY.  AWFUL.  It actually polluted the entire movie for me - I felt like I was watching a made-for-TV Disney kids movie.  Hideous mistake.    2) Darth Maul had the potential of being a GREAT foe, for the duration of the movie.  Instead, he engages in a couple of really great fights, then gets killed.    3) Instead of seeing more of Darth Maul, we are forced to suffer through the cutsy-wootsy little Anakin Skywalker.  Yes, establish his innocence, before his turn to the dark side, but really..... it was too much.    4) The droids were absolutely unbelievable.  Their speech was unrealistic, and they occasionally seemed to have a sense of humor that was like watching two computer geeks talk to each other.  It seems like they tried to stick to the sterotype of how a robot might work, but then threw in a cute little spin to it - - - it made them unbelievable.     5) What's with all the racial stereotyping?  The alien guys that look like fish have unaltered Asian accents?  Why?  Why does the water-going rastafarian-wannabe Jar Jar Binks have a Jamaican accent?  Why do the Jedi's have british accents?  It looks like GL spent too much time wanting accents, and not enough time working them out.  It's kind of offensive.      In conclusion, if it weren't for Jar Jar Binks, this movie would be quite worthy of the Star Wars name.  If it weren't for all the hype about this super-villain, Darth Maul (who was so easily dispatched), when the movie came out, it would be far cooler.  This movie isn't worthy of the Star Wars name.
B000001BZT|4.0|I love Steve Earle. I think Side 1 (I used to have the cassette) is as good as anything you'll ever hear. Side 2 seemed to be sort of a letdown after those first five great songs. As to the editorial review: the \\"wild-west themed\\" Snake Oil is about POLITICS....and the BS we get from politicians.........
B0013D8LOU|4.0|Whenever you put Tim Burton and Johnny Depp together you know your going to get a great movie and with Sweeney Todd they have done it yet again. It is a movie that is slow going but once it goes it is a pleasure to watch.<br /><br />  For those who don't know, the story revolves around a guy named Benjamin Barber who has a beautiful wife and daughter only to have both snatched from him which ultimatly makes him a changed man by changing his look and appearance and renaming himself Sweeney Todd plotting revenge to all those that destroyed his life. (Most of this is told through quick flashbacks).<br /><br /> This movie is NOT for the feint of heart though as it is bloody and gory throughout. The mood of the movie is dark and it shows through the visual effects. In fact, the person I was with thought the movie was in black and white.<br /><br />  A thriller like nothing before, it is essentially a musical which is weird for a movie like this for obvious reasons. It is also not like Depp and Burton to make a film like this however after seeing the movie, I couldn't see anyone else in the role. Depp is perfectly cast as is Helena Bonham Carter.<br /><br />  Johnny Depp has never before sung on the big screen nor did anyone think he could sing but once again he has surprised his fans and surprisingly has done such a great job with it. He deserved the win at the Golden Globes but unfourtantly the Oscar he so richly deserved was robbed from him as this is one of Depp's finest performances to date.<br /><br />  For some reason, Sweeney Todd didn't do as well in theaters as many thought it would. I guess it just isn't everyone's cup of tea. Thankfully the DVD will allow the movie to become the classic that it should be with great performances throughout.

B0012K1ILW|2.0|Every album Badu has released and graced us with has been of some measure memorable. Meaning, we can all remember some, most or all of the lyrics from songs like \\"On & On\\", \\"Bag Lady\\" and \\"Tyrone.\\" Heck, we can remember which album most of her songs are on. From the moment I opened up \\"Baduzim\\", \\"Mama's Gun\\" or her live album, I felt that special magic about listening to a Badu album for the first time. I think to some degree, as fans, we all felt it. Yet for me, something was different this time around. Something just didn't feel quite right. And to be honest, as much as liked \\"Worldwide Underground\\", it was with that album when the magic began to fade. Other than the song \\"Danger\\", can you honestly remember the name of three or more songs from WW? I can't. This is how I feel about \\"Nu Amerykah\\".     From the moment \\"Honey\\" dropped, I struggled to regain that feeling, that excitement of a new Badu album again. I figured, \\"oh, maybe its just a new sound that I have to get used to from her\\". But then I thought to myself, \\"why?\\". Why should I have to get used to it? If I don't like it, I don't like it right? Well, I don't like it. At least, not in it's entirety. The sequencing on this album is simply not very good and the tracks are jumbled in an array of songs without any direction of a beginning and true ending of an album. Then there's its pretentiousness. Sometimes, being \\"artsy-fartsy\\" about your music can be a bit annoying when folks on the receiving end are trying to make sense of some overly righteous, metaphysical malarkey in the form of \\"sexy\\" music. But there are some high points that should also be acknowledged as well.    Let's break down the tracks...     Amerykahn Promise: I'm surprised that Badu would lift an ENTIRE song and it's lyrics to use for the music on this track. For those who may not know, Amerykah Promise is a direct lift from The American Promise performed by RAMP (Roy Ayers Music Project), a group assembled by Roy Ayers in the mid 70's. See their album \\"Come Into Knowledge \\"in which was heavily sampled by rap music producers. Otherwise, a boring track.     The Healer: Produced by Madlib, a phenomenal producer in his own right. While talking about the significance of Hip Hop and its influence on the world, the beat was laced perfectly with her lyrics and her voice. Good track.     Me: This is one of the better songs on this album. The personal honesty in Badu's lyrics is on point and upfront. All of which establishes what made Badu such a phenomenal artist to begin with.     My People: Like Amerykahn Promise, this is a completely wasteful use of classic material. This time, she lifts music from Eddie Kendrick's song \\"My People, Hold On\\". Not sure where sure was driving at with this track. So this continues to be -->>.     Soldier: Hot track. This is another one of Badu's better songs on this album. She goes on talking about folks getting their act together and start \\"waking up\\" to the reality of the world that surrounds them. Not much science to learn behind that message. Otherwise, a good track.     The Cell: More repetitive social commentary.     Twinkle: Not sure where badu was going at with this track. Maybe I'm just not that deep enough. Next.     Master Teacher: Quoting a verse from this song, \\"What if there were no N***** and only Master Teachers?\\" Well, how about this Badu? What if we stop calling black folks the N-word, first? ...and maybe you'll keep my interest long enough to hear the rest of your song. Next.    That Hump: This is a track that everyone can relate to -- Moving through those pesky obstacles in life and in spirit. But the music is boring and doesn't do much except remind you of her \\"neo-soul\\" beginnings. Not feeling it.    Telephone: A wonderful tribute to music producer J Dilla aka Jay Dee. With words like -- \\"Just fly away to heaven brother, make a place for me, brother. Fly away to heaven, brother... save a place for me. Fly away to heaven, brother... put in a word for me\\"...this is without a doubt the best song on the entire album.     Bonus Track/Honey: Honey is clearly a track made for the radio. I didn't care for it in the beginning but admittedly, it has grown on me. It has a nice summery vibe with a reminiscent feeling of R&B music from the 80's. But what I don't understand is why on earth would this be the lead single if it's essentially a \\"hidden track\\" on the album? A lot of folks who bought this album told me that they bought to because of Honey, yet... they couldn't find it on the album. Sure they could have taken the time to listen to the album in its entirety in which they would eventually find it. But I still think this wasn't such a good idea, regardless of the fact that it doesn't, \\"fit\\" with the rest of the album.     Overall, this album is good for what it is, but hardly something that can equate as being as memorable as her first two albums. Also, its semi-pretentiousness tarnishes the honesty that could have taken this album in a more appreciative light. Then there's the sequencing that isn't very good and as a package, the album sounds lazy and uninspired. Hopefully \\"Nu Amerykah Part Two: Return Of The Ankh\\" will shed some light on this album like a sequel of a film attempting to explain the first.     Or is that too much to ask for?     With Erykah Badu, one can only know.
B000WC3AKI|5.0|The Good Things<br />*Great special effects.<br />*Gripping suspense and action.<br />*Good cast of characters.<br />*Pretty good story.<br />*Good, fun dialogue.<br />*Some good music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Focus on character drama sometimes overwhelms other story elements.<br /><br />On the surface, this is a good, fun, exciting film.  The special effects will certainly please anybody who likes special effects.  Good comedy, witty dialogue, and a gripping story with lots of conflicts makes the movie even more watchable.  At its core, this is also a good drama about an estranged couple trying to get back together.  At times, this drama makes the film a little tedious.  Otherwise, it is great fun, and would reccomend it to anybody who likes action, movies about scientists, and movies about natural disasters.

B000XUUQQK|5.0|Boogeyman 2 does something right here; it sets out to entertain us.<br /><br />From what you have gathered from previous reviews, this is not a sequel to the original Boogeyman, starring Barry Watson.  It stars a young woman by the name of Laura (Danielle Savre) and a young man named Matt (Henry Porter)as traumatized young adults, from witnessing the murder of their mother and father as young children. As children, they were convinced the \\"Boogeyman\\" killed them, and they grew up with a growing \\"Boogey-phobia.\\"<br /><br />The only real comparison you can make to the original is the fear the main character has for the Boogeyman.  The only difference, is that in the sequel there is no Boogeyman, only a psychopathic serial killer. In the end all this movie really ends up being is a slasher flick; a well done one at that!<br /><br />It has been a long time since a slasher film has truly grossed me out, and made me wince in my chair.  The gore factor was definitely there; this film but Jason and Freddy to shame.  The main part of the story takes place in the psychiatric wing of a local hospital, located in Santa Barbara, CA.  The terror takes place at night, one everyone has gone home.  One by one, each patient is plucked out, being murdered based on their greatest phobias.<br /><br />For a straight to DVD film, I was surprised by the seemingly high production value.  The cinematography was very pleasant, and the acting was very well done.  The effects were great, the gore looking a bit too real at points.  The pacing was perfect, and the ending has a nice little twist.<br /><br />If you did not like the original Boogeyman, and you love slasher pictures, check this one out.  If you are expecting a supernatural thriller, look else where. I hope you enjoy this one as much as I did.
B0011FXLCC|5.0|Oh my.     Just wait till July-ly-ly.     Vaguely, but only vaguely, reminiscent of the similarly exquisite From Gardens Where We Feel Secure by Virginia Astley which was recorded at John Foxx's [we are not worthy] studio. English pastoral. Cathedral Oceans. Revolving Birdsong, etc.. Europe After the Rain. All in the golden afternoon, full leisurely we glide...     Tomorrow Never Knows drum loops; Kinks' 'Village Green Preservation Society'/'Walter'; Trespass era Genesis; The Wicker Man; Kick Inside/Never Forever/Lionheart Kate Bush; Joni Mitchell 'Chalk Mark in a Rainstorm'; Basil Kirchin's soundtrack to \\"I Start Counting\\"; Bracknell newtown; quiet West Country market-towns on cool, long light summer evenings heavy with possibilities...     The kind of hangover Sunday morning comedown music that makes you glad/thankful to have been born in these islands.     Fragile. Strong. Resiliant. Truthful.     As if the music wasn't more bliss than we deserve, AG's cover shot is pure Goldie Hawn in \\"There's a girl in my soup.\\"  Gorgeousness and gorgeousity made flesh.  Sigh.     Oh my. Oh my. Oh my.
0930289234|4.0|Superheroes are never messy, tired, weak...<br /><br />You name it.  The Watchmen are all the above and Moore.  Under all that spandex and leather is a human being; flawed and scared.<br /><br />The whodunit on steroids; The Watchmen is a glance over the shoulders of a dysfunctional team of retired costumed adventurers investigating the murder of an apparently amoral collegue.  As the mystery unfolds, they catch glimpses of themselves and their human frailty.  The limitations and personality flaws are both the affliction and advantage of the team as they hinder and guide themselves to the awful truth.<br /><br />The characters are defined well and distinguished almost as they would be in a movie or a novel.  From their costume choices and methods of operation, they are exeedingly individual.  Journals and bios are referenced to indicate origins of profiles.  You are given the \\"why\\".  I'm afraid for the comic book genre and I'm a huge fan of it.  The standard has been raised...quite unexpectedly...and quite high.<br /><br />The Watchmen...Damn.

B00005JPAO|4.0|Right off the bat, let me say that I'm probably the only Di hater to review this movie here.  Oh, do I hate the hype around that Princess Di bitch.  I wanna puke like a bulimic.<br /><br />I believe I heard this movie isn't always historically accurate, but I guarantee you it's true to the characters.  Brilliant performances by everybody, not just The Queen herself.  I laughed out loud at the understated yet biting British wit, and the drama was compelling despite being driven by, well, Di.  I love this movie.
B000ZK4466|5.0|For some reason I find myself saying that many critics just don't get it when it comes to this band. The reason I say that is because the context of their work seems clear, but because they make no efforts to win over hipsters, I think \\"the scene\\" (whichever one that may be) takes it personal. Initially they put out the \\"Tremulant EP\\" which introduced us to their basic Zep-obsessed prog-meets-punk sound. Then they unleashed \\"Deloused in the Commatorium\\" which not only further solidified their sound, but also established them as more than a one-off side project of former At the Drive-In members, but in fact a formidable opponent on their own and clearly dominant over Sparta (the other At the Drive-In offshoot). Then they returned with \\"Frances the Mute\\" and many including myself, were disappointed to varying degrees because it was such a marked change. However, Frances was effective in reminding us that this is a band whom pride themselves on their Latin heritage, as the album ran the gamut from 60's Santana, to 90's Santana, to Buena Vista Social Club, to just about every other version of Spanish rock. Next came \\"Amputechture,\\" and just like the previous album, critics and fans alike sorely missed the context, which was basically blues (and to a lesser degree, jazz). Like the Latin theme of the previous album, Amputechture sought to prove that American blues was another critical part of this group's identity. This time they decided to bring back the vocal rock feel without the extended instrumental ambient passages. I expected this album to have a Middle Eastern theme that would awkwardly blanket the band like their last two albums themes, but I was wrong because only the beginning and the end really even classify. With \\"The Bedlam in Goliath\\" it's almost as if unrest itself was the theme, as these songs are more chaotic and dark in a way that is paced like the whole album is running for its ever loving life. Ironically the experimental vocal effects, combined with strait forward vocal performance in almost every part, reminded me of the Tremultant EP morphing into something bigger and more paranoid. This is the sound of a band coming unglued. 9/10strait forward vocal performance in almost every part, reminded me of the Tremultant EP morphing into something bigger and more paranoid.

0920668372|5.0|For those who really are trashing this wonderful book, I dont get it.  Now 20, raised by parents who always called me their baby since I was their only child...this book has stayed with me throughout my entire childhood.  My parents never read this to me, instead this was a book i picked up at a library and never forgot.  I can not believe people are trashing this book and calling it creepy.  Whats creepy is that all these people who claim to have children and blah blah blah are taking this book in the \\"dirty perverted\\" sense.  I dont think it was to be taken literally that a parent would ever do something such as creep in their own grown son's window and hold him. Its just a book to show the neverending cycle of love.  And as for the people analyzing it as ..where's the father, why is it only a bond between mother and son...oh come on. I bet the author thought people who read the book would have more of an open mind to imagine it being between any gender parent and any gender child.<br /><br />And on top of that ...the ones who analyze it as \\"what if it were between father and daughter?\\"  What if it was?  Why is that the question that people ask?  This book wasnt meant to be analyzed for how obsessive parents can be. Its just a book about love - never ending love.  And its so sad to me that people cant see that.  This is a book I'd read to my child and in the end hope that they always know and understand that no matter what I will always love him/her.  And in the end, I only hope after all the years that will come in between my child and me -- and I bet it will, that in the end, he/she will still return the love as strongly as they did when they were children when they didnt know anything except adoration for the one's who raised them.<br /><br />what a wonderful wonderful book.
B000H7JD4A|3.0|First of all, I'd just like to say that I'm glad Iron Maiden are still together and putting albums out. I thought 2003's DANCE OF DEATH was a fine modern Maiden CD with great cuts like \\"Paschendale,\\" \\"Rainmaker,\\" \\"Dance of Death\\" and a few others. I like the fact that Maiden has their own highly unique sound and refuse to jump on stylistic bandwagons. Iron Maiden is Iron Maiden.<br /><br />I'd also like to point out that I had owned and digested their debut album and KILLERS before Bruce Dickinson made his premier as vocalist and they subsequently made it big in America.<br /><br />With this understanding, I bought A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH when it came out in 2006 and I've given it numerous listens since then. I'm sorry but this isn't a very good Maiden album. It's okay; it's very original and I respect that; there are some good parts here & there and a couple of fine songs, but that's about it.<br /><br />What's wrong with the album?<br /><br />- For one the production isn't all that great for a modern CD. I'm not a big Evanescence fan or anything, but the production on their 2006 album THE OPEN DOOR was incredible. The thing is, Evanescence are a relatively new band while Maiden has been releasing albums since 1980. Since Maiden have WAY more experience shouldn't their CDs sound significantly better than a group of young bucks? The best way I could describe the production on LIFE AND DEATH is that it's raw. Even though this is so, it wouldn't matter to me personally if the songs were great (after all, I'm a huge fan of rawly produced albums like Bathory's HAMMERHEART). But this is hardly the case.<br /><br />- Bruce is a fine metal vocalist and has numerous stellar moments with Maiden, but on LIFE AND DEATH he too often sounds like he's straining to stay in key and it grates on the nerves (some places worse than others). What's interesting is that Bruce is a much better vocalist on his solo material. This indicates that he's likely pushed to do things against his better judgment in Maiden. Perhaps his judgment gets squelched by the democratic Maiden proccess machine. Who knows? All I know is that he comes across annoying on LIFE AND DEATH too often. I realize this is sacriledge to uber-Dickinson fans who automatically rate any Maiden CD a masterpiece as long as he's on vox, but I don't share such mindless enthusiasm. In fact, some of my favorite Maiden albums are without Bruce -- the debut, KILLERS and even X-FACTOR. But, don't get me wrong, I love Bruce; I just can't stand it when he grates on the nerves.<br /><br />- There aren't that many good songs on a WHOLE. \\"The Legacy\\" is nigh stellar and there are a couple of other decent tunes like \\"Different World\\" (notice I said decent, not great) but by and large the songs don't work as whole numbers. For instance, the beginning of \\"The Longest Day\\" is creative and catchy but it's ruined by most of the rest of the piece, especially the chorus. Despite this fact, you'll hear numerous shining MOMENTS interspersed throughout the CD, such as the chorus of \\"For the Greater Good of God.\\"<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH ranks with Iron Maiden's weaker efforts, but it's thankfully no where near as bad as VIRTUAL XI. Regardless, there's quite a bit to like and respect here if you're a Maiden fan, especially the fact that it's totally original, sounding like no other band or release. But, be forewarned, it's a real hit and miss mediocre affair IMHO.<br /><br />3/5 Stars is generous.his judgment gets squelched by the democratic Maiden proccess machine. Who knows?

B00133KFGW|3.0|***CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br /><br />Schmaltzy and predictable, AUGUST RUSH will still manage to please most movie-goers. The basic ingredients make this so: a healthy helping of a cute young kid (Freddie Highmore, [[ASIN:B000BB96M6 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]), a dose of a busted-up, romantic, musical couple (Keri Russell, [[ASIN:B000AJJNI6 Scrubs]], and Jonathan Rhys Meyers, [[ASIN:B000EQHXNW Match Point]]), and the sprinkling of a slimy vagabond (Robin Williams, [[ASIN:B00005JPCF Happy Feet]]).<br /><br />Highmore has come a long way in his short life. Having immensely enjoyed his portrayal as Peter in [[ASIN:B0007CNXUU Finding Neverland]], I have followed the career path of this super-young-star with interest. Most recently he's starred in [[ASIN:B00005JPNY The Golden Compass]] and [[ASIN:B00005JPXR The Spiderwick Chronicles]], two blockbuster films. Whoever his agent is, they've done a fantastic job.<br /><br />But Highmore has never taken on a role quite as focused as August Rush before. He tended to be overshadowed by the larger than life actors that played beside him (Johnny Depp, Anjelica Huston, etc.). But this time, the focus is all on his character, Evan/August Rush. His name change from Evan to August is affected by the wayward homeless musician \\"The Wizard\\" played by Robin Williams. The slime-factor is high for Williams here, higher than I've ever seen from him. This also made the story much more interesting and made you dislike Williams' Wizard character in the extreme.<br /><br />The love story between Lyla (Keri Russell) and Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is executed well if a bit distant and unrealistic. Their one night stand that results in a pregnancy becomes the culminating factor that binds all of the characters together. Well ...that ...and music, of course.<br /><br />Evan (Highmore) is lost amidst the U.S. orphanage industry until he eventually makes good his escape. He carries with him only his belief that music will somehow connect him with his unknown parents. He's lived music his entire, short life, so whenever he comes into contact with an instrument (be it a guitar or a piano) he quickly grasps its workings and can play it within moments. A prodigy, he's soon called by those that know him. Pulling him away from his dreams, however, is The Wizard, a man who wants to personally capitalize on Evan's astounding abilities by prostituting him to the highest bidder ...the highest bidder willing to pay his manager (i.e., The Wizard).<br /><br />Juilliard is offered up to Evan, and he quickly surpasses all those before him. But he still hasn't found his parents (who are also musicians), and a concert in New York's Central Park soon beckons them together. It's so sweet it'll make your eye-teeth ache.<br /><br />Even with its overly-sweet beginning, middle, and end, August Rush is something of a must for those who enjoy unique musical playing and the process of melodious discovery.<br /><br />Just don't eat any chocolate while watching it.music his entire, short life, so whenever he comes into contact with an instrument (be it a guitar or a piano) he quickly grasps its workings and can play it within moments.

B000UZ4EP2|5.0|Ok, that was a cheesy title. My apologies. I hate trying to come up with a title for reviews! Anyway, I just wanted to write a quick review of this CD. I had never heard of Moya Brennan until I picked up her CD Two Horizons (Which I recommend checking out. It's really good!) I was captivated by it. I loved the style and I really loved her voice. This CD is done in a slightly different style than Two Horizons but I have taken to it all the same. Even if the style of music is different it is still Moya's voice that is the star here. So soothing and easy to listen to. I especially enjoyed \\"Gone Are The Days\\", wonderful song! All together I really think this is a great CD. Keep it up, Moya!
B0007XT87G|5.0|This is some of the most satisfying music this old rocker has heard in 30 years.  PT stands out from all the mediocre grunge rock and rap of the last couple decades.  They're innovative, technically excellent, melodic, unique, and they're balanced with youthful driving energy and the intelligence of subtlety and sweetness.      An outstanding band whose members have the sophistication and foresight to put out their excellent music in SACD format!
B000A2WA5G|5.0|This DVD surprised me by shedding new light on the Dark Side of the Moon album thanks to interviews with Gilmour, Mason, Waters, Wright, engineer Alan Parsons, mixer Chris Thomas & others. There's a great quote fight between Parsons & Thomas over the compression. There are also some great lines from David Gilmour when he tells us how great Dark Side is, but how sad he is that he never got to experience it as a first-time listener like the public did. (Since he spent months making the album)
B00005JPTK|2.0|The visuals of a post-plagued New York City was about the only impressive aspect of this movie. The last half of I Am Legend is where the massive stink bomb drops, though. Viewers are presented with...what looks like... body-building mummies. I actually laughed...very hard. I also thought to myself...why didn't the producers go the whole nine yards and dress these creatures in Major League Baseball uniforms?
0060836253|5.0|The match of my current favorite author and favorite reader for audio books made for an enjoyable experience.  As you can probably tell by now, this review is for the audio book version.<br /><br />There are many very detailed reviews of this book that go into all the symbolism, writing style, and literary methods used by Gaiman and I am not going to even try to go down that path.  Let me say that I listened to this book after The Anansi Boys, which I also liked immensely.<br /><br />I saw that George Guidall read this and had to listen right away.  George Guidall is such a gifted reader he can make a text book interesting.  He has narrated hundreds of books and his accents, inflections, and ability to convey emotions is amazing.  I can and have listened to his voice for hours on end.<br /><br />The Anansi Boys was my intro to Neil Gaiman and on balance that book's pace moves along faster.  That does not mean I enjoyed American Gods any less.<br /><br />My wife read the book on my recommendation and did not like it that much finding some of the background information or historical vignettes too long and alternately boring and disgusting.<br /><br />I believe that Gaiman's books are much better enjoyed being listened to.  There are many people who say books can only really be enjoyed and/or appreciated when read.  I disagree completely.  Human beings have been telling stories to each other verbally for as long as we have had speech.  It is one of the most natural activities we have engaged in as a species.<br /><br />If you have found some of the other detailed reviews of the plot and characters has piqued your interest, I recommend getting the audio version of this book.  Take a long trip and listen to this in your car.  You will be able to travel hundreds of miles in a state of rapt attention.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Definitely worth the wait. I wish this could have just been another season so they could have made this as powerful as possible but it was still great. Everything made you feel like it was time to give up all hope but there are some powerful wild cards some you assume and some you didnt.
B000T1GKH2|4.0|Critics, amateur and professional alike, have made such frequent use of certain terms that they've lost all of their potency and are little more than cliches. The terms I'm referring to have been used in reference to Jethro Tull's Thick as a Brick probably more often than any other pop-rock record, with the possible exception of one: A Passion Play, also by Jethro Tull, which directly followed TAAB. It isn't that the terms pompous, pretentious, or self-indulgent, are without meaning, or that they are totally inapplicable to the aforementioned works, it's simply that those three terms, to name a few, are so hackneyed that it surprises me when someone who seems intelligent and informed uses them nowadays in a review, in the very same way it would surprise me to see a fine poet use the simile \\"red as a rose\\", or \\"soft as silk\\" in a new poem. As any reader of poetry knows, those two cliches are completely impotent to a modern ear, they convey nothing, they do no work, for the simple reason that they are worn out with use and are so familiar that as soon as the eye and ear register them they are passed over and given no attention at all.<br /><br />Jethro Tull's 1972 follow-up to the tremendously successful Aqualung album, Thick as a Brick, is one of the great grand-daddies of early prog and is to many minds perfectly representative of the so-called excess and self-indulgence of seventies art-rock, or whatever you wish to call it. In my opinion progressive rock was, unlike today, literally progressive at that time. The bands that flourished in the seventies were moving things forward at a truly amazing pace, and in that decade the biggest acts in rock were all unique, in that there was something about them, musically speaking as well as theatrically, which set them apart from everyone else and which was in its most genuine sense inimitable: Tull, Zeppelin, Sabbath, Queen, Yes, Floyd, to name a few. When Punk came along you had bands that were basically conservative to the core, bands that insisted on bringing rock and roll back to its roots. Those young tories had had quite enough of rock and roll as art, they were tired of poetic, narrative song lyrics, musical experimentation, innovation; they wanted the old anger, the bad reputations, the snotty, leather-jacketed, three-chorded rebellious conformity. There were some great punk bands, like the Clash for example, but overall punk seemed much more like a social movement than anything else and music was a tool, an expedient means of making a stink, whereas with prog and other types of forward-moving rock music of that era, music was an end in itself.<br /><br />As for self-indulgence: it's precisely because of this trait that we have some truly outstanding art to consume and enjoy, and it's the opposite of it which results in so much flimsy and ephemeral aural debris coming over the airwaves. I'm not just referring to bland top-forty crapola, but to many a recording artist across the popular-music spectrum, from rap and hip-hop to so-called alternative rock, industrial, and metal. Unlike the premier artists of the seventies, you could play mix-and-match with personnel from many of these bands and you'd hardly know the difference. Everyone wants to look the same, sound the same, create the same effect, convey the same emotion. I can't flip through a music-mag anymore without seeing the same angry eye staring out from under the same barbed eyebrow, the same f-you finger sticking up from the same tattooed forearm. Who is impressed by these flagrant concessions to conformity anymore? These people are not self-indulgent, they are selfless, in the worst possible sense, and selflessness doesn't enhance creativity, it puts a stop to it. That isn't to say there isn't some great music being made. There is; but many of the prevalent musical genres, rap, hip-hop, and all the various sub-genres of metal in particular, are so deeply infused with the punk esthetic of angry, mean-spirited uniformity that one has to wonder if there is any real concern among them about taking music into the unknown.<br /><br />When Thick as a Brick was issued it was virtually unheard of in the pop music industry. It's easy to use twenty-twenty hindsight and see that songs of epic proportions would become the norm for prog-rock acts throughout the decades to come, but you have to put yourself in 1972, when this sort of thing was only just getting underway. Not only was TAAB in most respects a novel and momentous release, it was also a great risk. Aqualung was tremendously successful, and Thick as a Brick sounded nothing like it. Aqualung was fraught with heavy, memorable riffs. Thick as a Brick was a spacious and evocative piece of music, a single song that gathered momentum as it went, and there was almost no heavy guitar at all, let alone any of those catchy riffs. Naturally such a piece of work makes certain demands of its listeners, and because of those demands many people have decided that TAAB is a pretentious and pompous record. How dare Ian Anderson think we should spend forty-five minutes of our time listening to something he dreamt up in his moments of self-delusion? Not that I think TAAB should be everyone's cup of tea. If you don't like it you are entitled to your opinion, and your opinion is probably as good as anyone else's. As I said in another review, it's senseless to render judgments about one another's tastes in music (and here I mean music strictly as music, not as socio-political posturing or fashion statement), since music appreciation is firmly in the realm of the subjective; but what bothers me is labeling a record as pretentious and pompous simply because it doesn't cater to your particular tastes, or because you haven't got the time to give it a fair listen, or, worst of all, because those terms are so common and easy to use.<br /><br />To be fair about it, there are some things about TAAB which I don't like. For one, it seems too fast-paced, which might sound ironic considering the song's length, nor do I think the production was top-notch. Also Ian Anderson had not yet gotten total control of his voice and his singing is full of youthful bravado and that pinched, sarcastic tone that we hear all over Aqualung. Contrarily, there are some more subdued, delicate passages throughout the piece, a particularly notable one being the \\"Do you believe in the day\\" section on side two. TAAB is the first outing for what was arguably Tull's best line-up, but in my opinion the truly great period for the band was to commence the following year, in 1973.has to wonder if there is any real concern among them about taking music into the unknown.

B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I saw this in the theatres, where it showed for just a very short while. I'm surprised that it didn't do better there, as the audience of ~50 people in the theatre all clearly enjoyed the movie. I was hoping it would come out on DVD by Christmas, but it did not. I put my order into Amazon to ship it when it came on DVD and had it three days later. The movie is, frankly, one of the most hilariously funny I've seen since the original Austin Powers. It's full of black humor and sight gags that just make you laugh out loud. -minor spoiler- I especially loved the first minute of the movie, where the oh-so-serious-undertakers bring the coffin in from the Daimler hearse in seemingly slow motion, and later leave in a hurry, spraying stones and kicking dust up as they leave in haste.
0316013684|5.0|I loved this book. I thought the main character was relateable, and through the story while he learns, the reader learns with him. The book will keep you laughing (and in my case, crying a bit too).
1582701709|5.0|The information in this book is powerful and transforming! Staying focused on your wants and desires in a real, applicable way enables positivity in everyday life and is completely applicable to business strategies! _The Secret_ educates and  informs about the law of attraction but also addresses concerns, arguments and gives life stories about each person who has experienced \\"The Secret\\".
B00005QW5X|4.0|\\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\" is not a typical love story.   It is a Boy-Failed-To-Turn-Girl falling into, out of, and into love with a Confused-Boy-Who-Stayed-Boy love story (And, of course, there is additional drama added by the complex feelings of Gay-Exhausted-Artist-Turned-Transvestite.) But though the story is made strange, the emotion is familar: love, true love, deep love; convincingly, compellingly portrayed.   It is often moving; slyly (sometimes rudely) funny. And, of course, the music rocks.
0143038419|1.0|This is a book that I had to force myself to finish. I kept thinking to myself that there must be something to all the buzz regarding this book. I honestly don't know what all the fuss was about. I understand that this is a memoir and about the author's experiences but my god this woman is damn proud of herself.<br /><br />Why? I wouldn't know. She strikes me as an affluent white woman with all of the opportunities that others only dream of. She is a Siddha yoga devotee and refuses to divulge who her guru is in the segment devoted to her ashram stay. But why would she mention Guru Chidvilisananda and Guru Muktananda when she is sooooo absorbed with herself. She should have titled this self indulgent fishwrap, \\"Me, Me, Me\\". It would have been a much more apt title.<br /><br />Her characters come off as caricatures. She is clearly dazzled by the exotic. Sure, wealthy white women are entitled to their ennui but please, save us from hearing how you had to make a parallel shift in your lifestyle or how you had to lose all of your money before you got lots and lots more!!! Perhaps the writer does not, in fact, lack depth but you wouldn't know it by this memoir.
B0012QE4OY|5.0|The fellow below me is, in all aspects, correct. If what you look for in a dance movie is to be highly distracted by a shabby plot. Me, I loved Step Up 2 for this very reason...    Most dance movies aim too high: they want killer dance scenes -with- an excellent plot. What do most wind up with? Trite, familiar plots they still try to execute even though we've seen them before (so we know well enough to follow along) while still delivering a sliver or two of dance sequences... but nowhere near the amount the usual viewer wants to see.    Now, Step Up 2 says a big \\"yeah right\\" to that entire idea.    There is next to NO plot. Yeah, it's there, barely. Enough to pretend that it's not one long music video. But, it really IS like one long music video--and that's wicked awesome. The dance scenes are long and intricate, the music is great, and it delivers on everything I want to see in a dance movie: less talking and more dancing.    So if you're into these sorts of movies for the chick flick value, it might be a skip or a rent. But if you're into it for, well, the dancing--I give it 5 stars.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|Did old folks know that Taylor Swift wasn't an American Idol Star? She started singing when she was fourteen. Taylor Swift put her first album out called Taylor Swift,she also put this album out in 2006.This cd includes the songs \\"Our Song\\", Picture to Burn\\", and \\"Mary's Song\\". This cd is mainly about her break ups with her boyfriends. Big Machine Records is the label company. Taylor Swift is a country singer, and her cd, Taylor Swift costs $9.99. This cd is a great cd as long as people out there like Country music.  Heather H.
B000ZOXDFA|3.0|Elizabeth - The Golden Age is in my opinion, almost as good as the first.  Instead of picking up closer to where the first had ended, this begins much later and several characters present in the first are not mentioned in this one.  However, Cate Blanchet continues to embody the powerful part of Queen Elizabeth I.  The movie ran on with scenes that had no build up of how they came to be.  The plot to assasinate was almost a duplicate as in the first movie. I would have like to have seen more of the person and less of the plotting.    Overall, it's worth watching.

B00005JLWN|3.0|Maybe I am getting jaded, but I really didn't see anything in this film that is not 1984-ish, except that the good guys win, with a bunch of fabulous martial arts thrown in.  There is absolutely nothing original about it, it is a used template.  Moreover, while the actors are pretty much a dream cast - Bale is brilliant at whatever he does, as is Watson - the directing is so tight, so controlled, so over-scripted that they have little latitude to add much character quirkiness.  There are tons of films like this:  a dystopia that suppresses what is most human, resistance grows from within, it reaches a climax with a few plot twists, etc., etc., etc.      Really, I wish it were better - I shelled out $10 afterall.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This moving Beatles music-driven movie is a must see for anyone with a place in their heart for the music and the memories of the time.  This video is an artistically crafted production with a plot that winds through the lyrics of some of your favorite songs, and moves your soul.      It brought me to tears,             and lifted my spirit.    This is a video I will watch again and again!     Buy it, watch it, love it!
B00005R5G9|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time the last week, and I thing that It`s an excellent movie, one of the best 80`s movies, and of course the girl is very hot.
B0001CNRB6|4.0|There is nothing better than classic Doris Day and Rock Hudson, but throw in Tony Randall, and you can count on a winner.  The threesome has appeared together before, but it never gets tiring.  One thing that surprised me was that this movie was ahead of its time, as you don't find many classics that emphasize sexual relationships.  A definite keeper - Many hilarious scenes that will make this movie enjoyable to watch over and over again.

0800141849|5.0|While this movie will never win any acclaim or awards, it was a light romantic comedy that hit a home run with me.   I liked Jeff Bridges and Barbara Streisand together.  They were funny and had good rapport together on screen.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|I've watched every episode of Stargate. I even paid for Showtime just so I could see it, before it gated over to Sci-Fi. I very much hated the last episode for reasons I won't go into here. This should give my review a context.<br /><br />Ark of Truth was good. Not great. I really like the actors and the characters they portray. The effects were up there and the interesting Ori story arc was closed nicely. HOWEVER, there was nothing new here. It was an extended episode. What was worse was the whole plot thread that seemed to be added by a fan of the Terminator. It was cheap and a waste. I can only guess their reasons for it but it was insulting to have to watch that to get to the real story.<br /><br />The ending hints at more adventures to come and I'm glad for that. Maybe they can take the Ark over to the Pegasus galaxy...
B000055ZB8|4.0|\\"The Bremen Incident\\" proved a touchstone in Nazi History. Moored in New York harbor in 1933 the German Cruise Ship The Bremen flew both the Traditional National flag of Germany as well as the flag of the newly elected Nazi administration; the centerpiece of the Nazi flag being the ancient occultic symbol The Swastika. Angered by Hitler's anti-Semitism a mob of communists and Jewish intellectuals stormed the ship and destroyed the crimson, white and twisted black flag. In the aftermath of \\"The Bremen Incident\\", Hitler rallied the country to adopt the Swastika as the national symbol of a united Germany. The Nazi Party flag, with its occult symbol in the center of an iris-like circle became the sole image of the German people.   above information paraphrased from the following site:   [...]    \\"When your candle burns low, you've got to believe that the last light shows you something besides the progress of darkness\\"   Blanche DuBois in A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE by Tennessee Williams       Dirge-like, deliberate, ominous and foreboding- a harbinger of impending doom, the vampire Count Orlock marches up the cobblestone streets of Bremen carrying his coffin. Director FW Murnau's 1922 occult masterpiece NOSFERATU uses the medium of film to capture the steady dark progress of not only a plague, but also eerily foreshadow the destructive rise of the German Nationalist Socialist Party. As Count Orlock transforms the bright and sunny sea harbor of Bremen-Town into a funeral procession of endless black coated shadows, so would Hitler leave Germany (and Western Europe) as a rubble strewn corpse, cloaked in darkness.    Murnau communicates this steady progress of darkness through a wide variety of film techniques, perhaps none more so than the iris wipe. As a transition device the iris wipe brings either light to a darkening screen or dark to a bright screen. Like the candle illuminating only a small circle of light so does the iris wipe photograph (the word itself meaning \\"light writing\\") a limited image. During the iris wipe, the central image-lit in a circle (like the iris of an eye) may be lit while the rest of the screen vibrates with progressing darkness. The darkness continues to advance on the circle of light until in completely swallows the image.    While Murnau does employ the lapse dissolve to bridge his sequences and scenes, the iris wipe dominates. This re-enforces the theme coursing throughout the film- the steady progress of invited evil methodically poisoning a healthy organism.     Count Orlock communicating to his disciple, the real-estate agent Knock through occultic ancient Sanskrit and Celtic-derived runes asks to purchase an abandoned estate adjacent to the unwitting Hutter and his virgin fiancé Ellen. The legal purchasing of property represents an invitation. Orlock does not invade in a blitzkrieg of dark force. He infects methodically. He is a dark disease descending upon and devouring the forces of light (the dressed in white and pure of heart and body Ellen). The iris wipe serves as visual metaphor for Orlock's power.    Like both the vampire and the steady iris-wipe, Hitler's diseased message of hate descended upon Germany and the world laden with occultic symbols. Legally elected to office, and frequently invited to \\"annex\\" unwitting neighboring nations, Hitler poisoned and plundered; fed off the riches of the land, the people and the culture-leaving a wake of cemeteries, rubble and black smoke.    Perhaps Murnau's off-screen interest in the occult and prophecy yielded a means of divining the future for Germany; perhaps not. Regardless, his eerie 1922 horror film NOSFERATU through its use of staging and film transitions foreshadows the blight of Nazism and the progression of darkness it cast over the light of the world.

B000P6R6X8|5.0|I saw Wilco in a bar in Pittsburgh just after their first album came out.  Took my teenage kids, might've been their first rock show. We  high-fived the guys after the show as they were going downstairs to the dressing room. They've come a long, long, way.   The tunes have really expanded - sometimes I don;t know what Mr. Tweedy is trying to say, but the way he writes tickles me like no one has in the last twenty years or so.  The new lead guitarist is THE INCARNATION OF JOHN CIPOLLINA (RIP - from Quicksilver MEssenger Service of long ago). Nels, you are the MAN! The guitar work and melodies on this album defy description. The bass playing is PERSIAN RUG! The drummer is CONCRETE SOLID. The keys add PECAN PIE & WHIPPED CREAM. I know you fellas won;t make another like this, but WILCO, you're in a great groove here. Folks, buy the recording with the DVD, it's a great look inside the band as they run through some tunes in their practice pad. WOWSA!
B000W1V5OC|4.0|This is supposedly the last Nightwish show done with Tarja Turunen on vocals. The show looks spectacular in every way...the energy of the band, the setting, the fans....the only thing that I don't like is that it appears that the band is \\"synching\\" to the music. I'm sure the music is from that show, however the editing makes it appear that they are not actually playing it. I'm sure Nightwish wanted a top notch production so they cleaned everything up for the DVD but it's just a little too weird not to see it as natural as possible. As for any special features, there is a documentary but it's boring to be honest so if anything get this disc for a great show & nothing more.

B0007D9VAK|5.0|I give this book 5 stars simply because it was written in a style that's easy to read and understand and uses common terminology.  The best part about it is the readability and resourcefulness of the content.  Everything a student needs to learn the subject matter in a motivating format!
B0011NVC9I|4.0|I had heard so much bad stuff about this movie it was hard to try to go in with a clean slate. I must say it was very good and I enjoyed every minute. It was full of excitement and a great story. This is a very adult movie too full of violence and action and adult themes as well as humor.<br /><br />I recommend it to anybody. Great flick. And the animation? Well half the time I forgot I was watching animation it was that good!
0765348780|5.0|This is perhaps the most incredible fantasy I've ever read.  Bear in mind that I've read Jordan, Tolkien, Martin, Herbert, and Card.    This book, the first of a ten book series, is filled with incomparable magic and significant intrigue.  It is like a combination of Jordan and Martin, with a lot more magic.  The characters are developed carefully over the course of the story.  There is some level of similarity between many of them, but the subtlety conveyed is thick for each one of them.  It is well done imagination.  The writing has some small flaws, but that is insignificant in this book because you so thoroughly enjoy the elements presented that you do not really care if the prose is perfect or not.    I think my favorite character so far is a young girl who is named Sorry.  She's not all that she appears to be, though.  We encounter this girl early on in the book and she is transformed by some process of magic (which is left unexplained, and so open to imagination) and this development leaves the reader wondering what is to happen to Sorry, and what has she become.  But, that is not the limit.  There are many characterizations therein that require you to pay full attention.    As Stephen R. Donaldson says, \\"Steven Erickson afflicts me with awe.\\"  I could not have said it better, myself.    Want an epic fantasy that will keep you up past midnight, yet forces you to take breaks so that you may consider all that has taken place over the course of reading?  Get this book.  Once you've read it, you will probably go after the entire series.  If the rest of the Malazan series is as good as this one, then I'm in for some very interesting times with Mr. Erickson.
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|I didn't care that this movie came out as Jerry Seinfeld is sometimes overhyped as being funny, when in reality, most the time he isn't.  I decided to rent this because a few other new releases were sold out at the video store.  I get home, watch it and within minutes, am floored laughing.  With a good message and superb humor, I went out today and bought this movie.  I love it and if you appreciate cartoons with a good message, get this!
B000NVIXFK|4.0|I would technically give this a bit under 4 stars.  But I'm so happy that Rush finally released another good album that I'm rounding up to 4 stars.  In relation to their other albums, Snakes and Arrows is probably closest in sound to Counterparts and Presto, though at moments there are elements of their earlier records as well.  I didn't care for Test for Echo or Vapor Trails very much, so this is really their second good album after they started moving away from the sound that defined their 80s period (Signals to Presto, with Moving Pictures serving as a transition into this period and Roll The Bones the transition out IMO).    For the most part the songs on Snakes and Arrows are very easy to listen to.  The two weakest songs for me are Armor and Sword, which has a heavy riff but no real fire, and Faithless, which feels like a hamfisted attempt for Neil Peart to re-write Free Will.  There are two good instrumentals here and one so-so instrumental (Hope) that is more like an intro than a song. I'm frustrated with The Way the Wind Blows because it opens and closes with a really fun blues line, and then loses it to become a mostly acoustic contemporary rock song that seemed like something from Geddy Lee's solo debut (which isn't a horrible thing, but its not very original).    The songs I find myself listening to most are Workin them Angels, which basically has the same riff as Armor and Sword, but with better lyrics and melody; Bravest Face, which has a lyrical rhythm that reminds me of several songs from Presto and Roll The Bones; Good News First, which is a good, modern sound for the band; and finally We Hold On, which has some incredible guitar work and a really incredibly catchy chorus which I happened to be singing to myself all day long at work.    Basically, if you liked Rush's early 90s work, you will probably find something to like on this album.  Lyrically it has more in common with their 80s work, but it lacks the new wave influenced synth-heavy sound of that period.  While its musically heavier than their 80s work, its definitely not a return to their fantasy/sci-fi epic style of the 70s.  Also, if you liked Test for Echoes or Vapor Trails (I did not like either), this is what both of those albums were trying to be, and accomplished what they did not.
B000EAT246|4.0|I do not even remember when I saw this movie for the first time. I do know that outside of Jaws and All that Jazz, this is one of Roy Scheider's best movies. I am not a movie critic, I just know what I like. This has plenty of action and a good plot to it. Also it is one of the first movies in which I saw Daniel Stern.
B000ANVQ0K|1.0|This movie only gets good when the ship hits the iceberg. And then only for a few tense minutes. It is a boring love story upon which the couple involved happen to be on a ill fated ship. Why do people take such a historic event and make sauch a boring movie out of it. This movie is as bad as \\"Pearl Harbor\\".
B000YIGNKE|1.0|This movie was a complete disappointment.  it left me wondering one thing, have the creator's of this film ever read or watched Persuasion.  What was the point of hitting the shuffle button on one of the most beautiful plots ever written.  They completely took any meaning away from Wentworth's letter and mixed up the plot so much the to create drama they had Anne Elliot running all through bath.  The ending seemed forced.
B000JJS8TM|4.0|When I bought this DVD-Audio album, many of the tracks had a serious distortion problem that rendered the album unlistenable, which I now know is a fixable problem.  I traded it in hoping for a non-defective copy.  No luck.  I went to the internet and found that I was not alone in this problem, but that it seemed to be somewhat equipment specific, my player, a Pioneer DV-578A being one of the afflicted. My center channel speaker doesn't have much response below 80hz so I have it marked as a \\"small\\" speaker in the setup menu, thus sending the lower frequencies to the front sides which are flat down to about 25hz.  This works fine most of the time but not on \\"Love.\\"  When I changed the setup to  a \\"large\\" center speaker, ALL audio problems vanished.  I have never listened to the CD.  Why would I want to!  The audio quality on the DVD-Audio blows away any other Beatles sound I've ever heard except for 1960s vintage British pressings of the original albums, and in some ways, the DVD-Audio is to be preferred.  For example stereo-recorded parts that were mixed down to mono hard panned to one side or the other on the original stereo album mixes are in real stereo here spread across 2 or more channels, as they were on the album, \\"1.\\"  Only here they sound much better with the much higher resolution of DVD-Audio.  It rather whets ones appetite for SACD or DVD-Audio releases of the Beatles catalog with new mixes from the original parts in surround AND in stereo (and in some cases  mono, too), designed to reflect the balances chosen in the original mixes, but without the hard panning and monoed down-mixes.  Meanwhile we have this, not exactly the originals, but respectful and great sounding.
B000ICL3KG|3.0|If you strip out the totally self-serving \\"Al Gore, the only person on the planet who really understands\\" attitude and the egregiously, makes you want to gag  \\"feel sorry for me, Al Gore, I was robbed\\" material that this documentary is liberally laced with, you have an outstanding documentary that makes a clear and compelling case for global warming and that this issue needs to be addressed now. The pure documentary part is worthy of 5+ stars. The Al Gore part is worth zero stars, and indeed negative stars were they available. Average it out and 3 stars is a fair rating for the whole package. That Gore has this compulsive need for constant self-aggrandizement and public self-pity is sad; it also detracts from an otherwise well-told and well-presented case for environmental action. That the Academy Awards saw fit to honor this with Oscar awards shows how totally out of touch with reality they are.<br /><br />If you want a just-as-compelling case without the Gore nonsense, I recommend \\"A Global Warning?\\", the History Channel documentary (available here on Amazon), which is easily just as good (arguably better because it's just as long but adds more substance to replace the histrionics found here).
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I'll admit I was a little disappointed with the final show of the last season. It seemed rushed to me and didn't wrap things up that I thought needed a conclusion.     The Ark of Truth fixed that. It really was a great movie. Well written, interesting story line excellent visual effects (although the standard episodes had great visual effects all along).     Yeah, I can say I was very pleased with the movie and hope they make a new feature length film with this cast every year or so.    Lastly, I can't believe they made that quality of a movie for 7 million dollars. Compared to many 50-70 million dollar flicks I've seen in terms of quality, The Ark takes the cake. Well done
B000ZOXDFA|4.0|Cate Blanchette makes Elizabeth live again with an intriguing performance that lets us believe Elizabeth was just this engaging, intelligent and awe-inspiring. Wonderful costuming!
B00005JPLW|3.0|This is a gorgeously shot movie.  It will take you in on scenery alone.    But...  It is no Gladiator. It is no Braveheart.  It is no Sin City.    Honestly, the slow mo cuts got old, and the pacing was varied.  I found the History Channel treatment of the real events (including more than just a passing scene on the naval strategics) to be a much more satisfying and interesting story.    If you do not have the aforementioned titles, get them first.  They are more deserving of the money.  If you feel you must have this movie, I suggest you buy used, or if you need to show off your HD display or new HD player, get the HD version.  I am sure it's magnificent to look at.
B0010358D0|5.0|I like the film because the graphics were a better improvement than the first not that the first was bad in the first place. The story was a little more creative that the original because the first part was a little more slower paced in the begining (Not including the intro)and picked up more in the middle. While this one picked up more quicker in the begining keeps you in the suspense till the end. The voice acting i felt was a better improvement than the original as well.     Is this movie worth buying? Yes     Will it be better than the original? Yes    Go get it and watch it you won't regret it. And for those who hated the first and writes that the sequel sucked. My reply is why did you see it in the first place if you hated the first? Leave the reviews to the ones who like the first.
B00004WG2F|4.0|This movie was actually quite a suprise I dodged watching it for years untill just a few years ago. Maxim machine guns, WW1 , and the American Frontier pretty good stuff. Little Luvy Duby at points but the Helmets The Germans wore during the war make up for all that.
0452289963|5.0|Like other reviewers here, I came to this book hoping for something half as good as Tolle's other works.  I did so because I didn't think anything could top my past experience with him- that experience pulled me out of an incredibly deep depression, not unlike Tolle's own dark night of the soul that he describes in \\"The Power of Now\\".  What I have found is that \\"A New Earth\\" helps bring the entire philosophy into a greater sense of order and the depth still blows me away.  Anyone walking away with only one or two \\"Aha! moments\\" needs to turn back to page one.  His message is so clear and so effective- it was then, it is now.  In fact, since reasserting \\"silence\\" with my \\"egoic self\\", I've found a great deal of the inspiration that was admittedly lacking in my life.    I would also recommend Tolle's audio presentation \\"Living a Life of Inner Peace\\" for a short but effective reminder to be present and cherish the only thing that is- the present moment.  For those willing to look past the confines of a man-made societal box, Tolle's answer to many deep questions is incredibly simple: Just be.
0689878451|1.0|I think this is so inappropriate for young readers!  The content is not for children - why must authors and publishers alike push their gay activism and disguise it for children?  What a sad, sad concoction.  Children don't need this in any form.  Protect them.
B000WAGVHE|4.0|I loved this movie.  I loved the original John Waters movie, loved the Broadway musical, and loved almost all of this in the theaters, the only major exception being a miscast John Travolta.  They should have gotten Harvey Fierstein - yes he is in general an acquired taste, but there is no better Edna.    The Blu-Ray transfer is excellent and the special features are extensive, entertaining and enlightening.  My only issue is the audio.  The *only* audio track is DTS 7.1 and, as someone mentioned previously, that doesn't always work.      I have a brand new mid- to high-range receiver (Denon), which is capable of DTS 7.1, but my living room can't handle that many speakers, as there is no room for the rear.  Instead of converting it ot 5.1, apparently receivers (or at least mine) can only convert to fairly crappy stereo.  As I am sure that there are many people in similar situations, especially considering 7.1 is a relatively new format, they really should have included a 5.1 mix as well.    This is the first Blu-Ray disc I have had that only had the 7.1 option, so I don't know how common this is, but I hope it is not a industry-wide trend that I am going to have to figure out a way around.  Anyone else having the same problem?
B0010358D0|1.0|I hate this DVD.  Ok why do I hate it?      The story is all over the place, it seems like several people worked on the story and threw a final version together.  Also the story does not follow any of Mr. Shirow's original books, which is a shame since his original story is such an Excellent original mix of CyberPunk and Greek mythology. I wonder if the movie writers read the original stories at all!     The Animation quality is not up to the standard of the first movie.  The characters are not rendered is the same beautiful style of the first DVD. It is close, but it is different.     One Star. There are alot of cool Mech models in this the 2nd Appleseed DVD movie.  And the city models and sets are also quite awesome.     If you are expecting a SHIROW Appleseed movie, forget it, it's not here.    Very disappointed!
B000002NJS|5.0|\\"I traded fame for love without a second thought,\\" Madonna sings behind a soft, hypnotic backdrop of \\"Drowned World,\\" the opening song to her masterpiece album that was released ten years ago today. Madonna certainly changed both as an artist and person during this time with a sonic groove added to many of the songs along with an album that's emotional, spiritual, and greatly personal. Her shift in perception and questioning the meaning of life was genuine and even helped many skeptics forgive and forget her past musical choices that sparked controversy. Certainly there was no controversy necessary here as this is Madonna at her most real. Following her role in Evita, her voice never sounded better, and with the birth of her first child and her expanding interest in yoga and religion at the time, her convictions and honesty come off as deep and enlightening rather than something of shock value. Though she hasn't yet matched the brilliance of this release, she may do it again someday and maybe even with her upcoming release, Hard Candy. If not, fans can always embrace her Ray of Light.
B0013FFMOK|5.0|I gave this movie 5 stars based on the interaction between Will Smith's character and his dog.  The potrayal of this relationship by Will Smith is some of the best acting I have observed in a movie.  To not pick up on that is to miss the best part of the movie.  I credit the premise for going against the typical man and woman action delivery of most movies.  Will Smith's development and potrayal of the relationship between his character and the characters dog is one of the most underated/overlooked prformances of the 2007.
B000002J6H|4.0|Why does amazon think they need to feature that awful review? I don't even see how the argument could be made for Nash or Crosby being most accomplished:     Graham Nash: had a really pleasant voice and was a gifted harmonizer. As an instrumentalist he was of such a low standard that The Hollies used to turn off his guitar for live shows. He wrote some really nice songs and is a worthwhile artist indeed, but he should be taken out of the running for most accomplished immediately thanks to his very basic instrumental ability and the fact that his songs often lacked in intensity.     David Crosby: One of the most powerful voices in rock and roll. Very hit and miss songwriter even from the days of The Byrds, his ambition often seems hampered by too much drug use. Potentially a major artist, but essentially an underachiever. His guitar playing is decent, very good support player to better players like McGuinn and Stills.     Neil Young: I have to admit I may not be his biggest fan, but I recognize the importance of his achievements. His playing and singing lack the polish of Stills but he could be seen as a singular artist. He contributed little instrumentally to the songs of others on CSNY albums, which can be said of Crosby and Nash too (though certainly not Stills) and he lacked the natural harmonizing abilities of his compatriots. Good artist but like all these guys (including, it must be said, Stephen after his first few solo albums) often underwhelming in the quality of his output, though certainly not the quantity.     Stephen Stills: As commercial a songwriter as Nash and as intense as Young. Not as naturally gifted a singer as Crosby but uses his limitations in his favour. Can play any rock instrument and play them all astonishingly well. A true master on the acoustic guitar. Songs stand up decades later, and although his inspiration has run dry since, at the time before, including and shortly after this album he was DEFINITELY the most accomplished musician ofthis group (a case can be made for Young depending on your taste). Amazon's review must be changed.
0385338724|4.0|First off, I have to admit that I've never read any books in Sophie Kinsella's bestselling Shopaholic series. So I dove into REMEMBER ME? with a completely fresh and somewhat curious attitude. Would it live up to the popular hype of that series? I must report, much to my surprise, that I couldn't put it down. It's fun, funny and told in a Bridget Jones-esque slang that, I suppose, Kinsella has polished to a brilliant sheen and made very much her own. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this novel.    REMEMBER ME? concerns Lexi Smart, who, when we first meet her, is 25, working at a carpet retailer, having trouble with guys like Loser Dave (that should give you a heads-up on her romantic prospects), going to dingy clubs with her mates and getting wasted for lack of anything else to do. After a car accident, Lexi wakes up to find herself 28 and fabulous. She is the director of the sales department at her previously dead-end job, is gorgeous (even her British smile has been evened out and whitened, to what would be a considerable expense), has a Louis Vuitton purse with marching wallet (again, big expense) --- and she's thin!    Imagine waking up to a new and improved you and not having any idea how you got there. Then add in a super-rich and dashing husband you don't remember marrying, and secrets and schemes that show up the dark side of your seemingly perfect existence, and you have the basic makings of a really fun and fast read.    Kinsella's eye for detail wavers a bit thin, depending on the readers' knowledge of top posh brands to drive home her points about living large in the big city. However, it is her ability to weave little secrets into the plot line, enlivening it when you've gotten sick of the crass commercialism that Lexi is so inundated with, that makes REMEMBER ME? such a memorable novel. It's the perfect book to be turned into a film. I can imagine Ben Chaplin as the handsome but businesslike Eric, the husband she didn't know she had; Colin Firth asthe dashing architect who unleashes a new worldview on Lexi; and perhaps the delightful Emily Mortimer or hilarious Emily Blunt as the Alice-down-the-rabbit-hole Lexi, trying to figure it all out.    Lexi's journey is a rollercoaster ride of revealed secrets and behind-the-scenes intrigue, and Kinsella aptly describes Lexi's problems with her memory with interesting details that help the reader stay in touch with Lexi's emotional turmoil. The British slang, for you Anglophiles out there, is deliriously funny, and the supporting characters --- from Lexi's punk princess sister to her outdated mum and even her rake of a dad (seen only via videotape taken before he died three years earlier) --- fill in the missing pieces of Lexi's true self very nicely.    Kinsella clearly has another hit on her hands with REMEMBER ME? And now I'm off to find myself some Shopaholic titles before the film version comes out. I hope I like that series as much as I enjoyed this book!        --- Reviewed by Jana Siciliano
B000002LND|5.0|The cheekily titled Immaculate Collection contains the majority of Madonna's smash hits from the 1980s to early 1990, including such pop standards as Like a Virgin, Papa Don't Preach, Holiday, La Isla Bonita, and Material Girl. However, there are some other great slow additions that don't receive quite as much radio play in the present, including Crazy For You, Live to Tell, and Open Your Heart. There's one of Madonna's edgier, more overtly sexual tracks at the end of the CD, Justify My Love, that foreshadowed her [[ASIN:B000UOGHKS Erotica]] and [[ASIN:0446517321 Sex]] period.<br /><br />Although I was too young to remember most of these firsthand, especially earlier tracks like Borderline or Lucky Star, it's a testament to Madonna's enduring legacy that I know so many of them by heart from radio exposure and soundtracks. Even though the production (synths, drum machines) dates many of them, they are still enjoyable on their own, many with stronger lyrical chops than I would have expected for dance pop.<br /><br />To be honest, this would have been better as a 2CD set to allow for major omissions such as True Blue, Angel, Dress You Up and Who's That Girl, but fans looking for her earlier dance hits such as Vogue and poppy delights such as Holiday and Cherish won't be disappointed. Also, several of the songs are remixes rather than original album versions, which may disappoint some fans, but overall, this is a pleasing pop confection sure to bring back memories of the '80s from one of music's enduring voices and trendsetters (cone bras, anyone?).
B00104QSOM|5.0|Let's face it. America, and the world were dull in 2007. Here's what was interesting. The Rockies run to the WS, and two little films entitled There Will Be Blood and No Country for Old Men. Both brilliant epics, one being substantially better than the other. That one is Blood.  Daniel-Day Lewis. Wow. Hard to imagine a better actor ever gracing this earth. The movie is based around Day-Lewis. It's what makes the picture click. PTA is a great director, no doubt, but this is Daniel's show.  Day-Lewis plays a man named Daniel Plainview. Kind of a mean guy, really. But he is an entreprenuer who adopts a baby left behind by one of his dead workers. He uses the kid to make profit and put a smile on people's faces. The entire film is about plainview making his fortune via any means necessary. And by the end, you'll feel like you got hit with a baseball bat.   This movie is HUGE, the definition of a major motion picture. But not hokey in any way. Its not Pirates or King Kong. It is a stunning masterwork on all levels, from the script to the cinematography to Day-Lewis' performance. This is an earnest as a film gets.  Idiot viewer beware: if you think that the film has heaps of gratuitious violence because of the name or that you won't have to do any thinking to comprehend it, please, go enjoy Norbit instead. This movie is the equivalent of a social issues class, hitting you over the head with morals and practically shouting questions at you in so many words.   Trust me. See this movie. Unless you qualify as a retard like some of the other reviewers on this site. It SHOULD have won best picture at the oscars. No Country did because that movie was packaged flawlessly in every which way. But Blood is gritty, not too stylish, and perfect for the thinking viewer. Sometimes I think that the only reason NCFOM got so much praise was because it was a Coen brothers film. If you had seated Michael Bay or someone to make that film, well then Blood would have been noted as practically the ONLY film in 2007 worth a hoot.   P.S.for every Bush-lovin, flag-wavin America fanatic out there, which I am indeed not, you had better love this film because it doesn't get any more purely American than this.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Ratatouille, from Pixar and Brad Bird ([[ASIN:B00005JN4W The Incredibles (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]], [[ASIN:B00009M9BK The Iron Giant (Special Edition)]]), is a rat's-eye view of the gastronomic delights of fine cuisine (the name itself is a pun on the classic French roast vegetable dish ratatouille). Remy is a young rat who discovers that he has a heightened sense of taste and smell, and becomes inspired by the late television chef Auguste Gusteau (Brad Garrett), whose motto \\"anyone can cook\\" now extends to rats, too. Remy begins to experiment with combining classic combinations of flavor and texture, herbs, and other ingredients, until his clan is forced to flee their country safehouse.<br /><br />During the traumatic escape, Remy is separated from his family. The ghost of Chef Gusteau appears to Remy when he is discouraged, inspiring him to cook at Gusteau's formerly-five star restaurant. The acid restaurant critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) made it his personal mission to write a scathing review of Gusteau's that stripped it of one of its Michelin stars, consigning it to the tourist trade. Now, the restaurant is under the iron fist of the shady, domineering Head Chef Skinner (Ian Holm). Remy befriends the bumbling, couldn't-boil-water-if-his-life-depended-on-it Alfredo Linguini, whom Skinner grudgingly adopted as the new garbage boy, and Remy and Linguini team up to create culinary delights that astound the normally staid French restaurant critics. Remy controls Linguini by hiding under his chef's toque and tugging on two strands of hair (the scenes of Remy perfecting his technique with a blindfolded Linguini wielding dangerous tools and messy ingredients are priceless). Toss in a handful of intrigue, kitchen highjinks, father-son bonding, a dash of romance with the formidable chef Colette, and plenty of culinary delights, and you have Ratatouille.<br /><br />The 3D animation is photorealistic, and 360 shots of nighttime Paris entrance. Small touches really capture the Bohemian feel of the Montmartre district, and the soundtrack features (brief) snippets of La Marseillaise, light and airy French themes, and French-language vocals by Camille (the standalone soundtrack [[ASIN:B000PKG7HK Ratatouille]] is available for purchase). As with The Incredibles, there's lots to keep kids engaged (although the scene with the window full of dead rats might be traumatic for very young kids), and a whole other layer of adult humor bubbling under the surface, so mom and dad will be able to enjoy Ratatouille with gusto.ohemian feel of the Montmartre district, and the soundtrack features (brief) snippets of La Marseillaise, light and airy French themes, and French-language vocals by Camille (the standalone soundtrack [[ASIN:B000PKG7HK Ratatouille]] is available for purchase).

B00003CXCD|5.0|Roman Holiday is a beautifully bittersweet romance starring Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck (originally, it was optioned by Frank Capra, who had hoped to cast Cary Grant and Elizabeth Taylor in the lead roles). Hepburn plays the spoiled Princess Ann, who is fed up with palace life and the endless protocol. After being given a sedative, she makes a run for it and ends up out cold on a park bench in Rome, where newspaper man Joe Bradley discovers her and begrudgingly takes her home with him, fearing for her safety.<br /><br />He quickly pieces together her formal, outdated manner of speaking and the disappearance of the princess (official reason: sudden illness), and his first inclination is to cash in on her secret identity by writing a tell-all story for $5000. He enlists his friend Irving as photographer. But as Joe indulges Ann's simple wishes for gelato, sightseeing, and a dash of adventure, he finds himself genuinely falling for Ann. The two engage in a complicated tango of avoidance; Joe hides the fact that he's press, and Ann tells him that she's run away from school. Irving uses a camera hidden in his lighter to snap impromptu photos. Poor Irving is tripped and spilled on by Joe in a none-too-subtle attempt to shut him up before he spills the beans on more than one occasion, and I felt bad for Irving's bewildered expression as Joe keeps taking him out.<br /><br />Pandemonium breaks out as the palace sends out secret police to retrieve Ann, and the film falls into near-slapstick in the final third at a barge dancehall. The ending is bittersweet yet appropriate, neither too much nor too little. Roman Holiday is a stunning vehicle for the luminous Audrey Hepburn, who won an Oscar for her performance, was the first comedy for Gregory Peck, and most of all, serves as a showcase for the timeless wonders of Rome. It was the first American film to be shot entirely in Italy (Paramount had frozen assets in Italy). Real Italian nobility and real international press corps were featured in the film. Most of the locations exist, and the colorful, authentic backgrounds and ethnic faces add a degree of authenticity that could never have been matched in a California studio.<br /><br />There are several extras including a documentary on the film's restoration, a stills gallery, and the original trailer. The transfer is crisp enough and looks fresh despite its age. Roman Holiday will appeal to fans of romance, comedy, and travelogues, and is a mesmerizing blend of all three elements.d in the film.

This is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand some aspect of the people of Afghanistan, especially the women, what they suffer on a daily basis and why the culture is the way it is in some areas.  Never a dull moment in this book and I couldn't put it down.  Truly extraordinary!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones' debut album Come Away With Me is as comforting as a steaming cup of coffee on a cold morning; just let yourself slip into the dreamy rhythms and feel the tension melt away. Opening with Don't Know Why, Norah's piano gently underscores the snare brushes and bass. Seven Years has the nostalgic reminiscence of an old-time music box, while Hank Williams' Cold, Cold Heart is given a bouncy, playful beat and Norah's delivery sounds as though she's wearing something between a Mona Lisa smile and a Cheshire grin, despite the lyrics. Come Away With Me is the standout track; mellow and slow, it's a sensual, late-night slow jam, a last dance before the band packs up. Norah is at her most poetic and open here.<br /><br />Turn Me On finds Norah channeling her earlier blues persona with Peter Malick ([[ASIN:B00009QI3R New York City]]) with a growled, husky delivery and bluesy piano riffs. Lonestar is an old-fashioned country ballad that could reflect Norah's home state of Texas. I've Got To See You Again is an erotic Latin-charged ballad, with prowling snare brushes and smoky tango chords. Norah's layered harmony is used to great effect, and the song reminded me of Sway. Also deserving particular merit is Norah's enchanting, sexy cover of The Nearness of You. Simplicity itself, it's just Norah and her piano evoking images of Casablanca and classic 1940s romance.<br /><br />Nightingale opens with steel-string guitar and sounded like a 1960s Joan Baez folksong. What Am I To You slides back into a slow country waltz.<br /><br />The strengths of Norah's first (and in my opinion, her best) album lay in her effortless bridging between various genres including jazz, folk, and country. The majority of the songs are original, penned by Jones and her band, and she inhabits them with a maturity and grace far beyond her years. This may be my favorite album to unwind to; it's guaranteed to wash away the tensions and worries of the outside world.
B00000255F|5.0|Bruce Springsteen & The E. Street Band-Born To Run *****<br /><br />In 1975 Bruce Springsteen & The E. Street Band released what many consider to be the greatest rock n' roll album of all time, and  they may be right, I don't agree but it is damn close. With Born To Run Springsteen said he set out to create the greatest American rock album, so it is no wonder that the album came out so good. If I was going to give that mission to anyone Bruce would be among my first choices.<br /><br />Born To Run is the first album to be credited to both Springsteen and The E. Street band. Clarence on sax, Max on Drums, Steve on guitar and the rest of the boys saddled in to make history.<br /><br />With the lyrical matter dealing with such subjects as love, finding yourself, breaking out, and just having a good ol' time, Born To Run has something to offer everyone. The classic `Thunder Road' opens the album. A song which is easily among the top 100 songs ever written. `Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out' is a personal favorite and one that I feel is underrated and among the very best songs the Boss ever pinned. The angst of `Backstreets' is a song for every young person. The title track `Born To Run' is easily the best song that Springsteen ever wrote and is among the top ten rock songs of all time. Featuring some of the greatest lyrics of all time about not excepting little and going for everything that you can.  The song still gives me chills to this day. `She's The One' is a silly love song that had it been performed by anyone else would have come across stupid and pretentious but the boys made it work. `Jungleland' closes the album with what just might be Springsteen's magnum opus. With Beat Poet meets Bob Dylan lyrics  you have this albums `Rosalita.' The band couldn't have ended the album with a better song.<br /><br />I will just end on this, Born To Run is the one album that if you don't have it in your album collection, then you can't call it an album collection
B000N3AWDE|4.0|D'elles is Celine's follow up to 1995's bestselling [[ASIN:B000024JE2 D'Eux]] and as such, is a shout-out to grrrl power (the clinical-sounding official line is \\"a concept project that celebrates womanhood\\"). The lyrics for the thirteen songs were written by well-known female authors from Belgium, France, and Canada, including Fran'oise Dorin, Christine Orban, Nina Bouraoui, Marie Laberge, Lise Payette, Denise Bombardier, Nathalie Nechtschein, Jovette Alice Bernier, Janette Bertrand and George Sand (Baroness Dudevant).<br /><br />The studio wizards include the four collaborators on Celine's last French album [[ASIN:B0000DJZ7W 1 Fille & 4 Types]]: Jean-Jacques Goldman (music supervisor), Jacques Veneruso, Erick Benzi, and Gildas Arzel (the \\"four guys\\" referred to in the title of her earlier work). My favorite Acadien singer-songwriter Jean-Francois Breau ([[ASIN:B000DZJHSI Expose]]) also contributes his songwriting expertise.<br /><br />Some of the thirteen songs have uptempo flirtations with dance music (Et s'il n'en restait qu'une, A cause), while others are gentle slow ballads (On s'est aime a cause, Je ne suis pas celle). We even see Celine \\"duetting\\" with the late Maria Callas through studio wizardry on La diva, although Celine sings along so softly with Callas that it's difficult to hear how her operatic aspirations measure up. Another of the more experimental tracks is Lettre a George Sand, in which Celine recites the text of a letter from George Sand and dissolves into a melody that somehow reminded me of my grandfather's favorite religious song \\"Prayer of St. Francis.\\" My least-favorite track was the grating lullaby Berceuse, in which Celine merely whispers the words and infinitely repeats the \\"Mama t'aime\\" (\\"Mommy loves you\\") chorus ad nauseum.<br /><br />Overall, it's a pleasant, if sometimes bland, listening experience that makes for pleasant background music, but for the most part, the songs blended together and weren't instantly memorable on first listen. Also beware if you buy the deluxe edition from France: the bonus DVD is Region 2 PAL only; Amazon.com didn't specify that, and I ended up returning my copy since it was pointless paying $26 for a disc I couldn't play (I had erroneously assumed that the deluxe edition was the Canadian, not European import, and it was not labeled as such).buy the deluxe edition from France: the bonus DVD is Region 2 PAL only; Amazon.com didn't specify that, and I ended up returning my copy since it was pointless paying $26 for a disc I couldn't play (I had erroneously assumed that the deluxe edition was the Canadian, not European import, and it was not labeled as such).
0321344758|5.0|Yes, this book makes me think contrary to the title. And I assume that's what the author wanted, and he lives up to it. I am happy I got this one.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|To put it simply, if you watched SG1 and can't wait to see the ending to the Ori story arc, buy this movie now.  The Comic-con special feature is great, too.  It's great to see the actor's talking about the show we (including them) all love.
B00006F83Y|5.0|Songs for the deaf i have to say is a really good album. We got some great songs on this one. Well of course there are some songs that i did not really enjoy, which is: six shooter, a song for the dead, you think i aint worth a dollar but i feel like a millionaire, and the final track; mosquito song. But still, all the rest of the songs like the sky is falling, no one knows, first it giveth, go with the flow, gonna leave you, do it again, and god is in the radio are pretty amazing.      rock on queens of the stone age!!!!!!!
0751532711|3.0|He did have some out-of-the-box creative ideas and things i had not thought about before. he makes some valid arguments and forces you to re-assess common assumptions.     but he also makes statements that are simply not practical for most real people.
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|Well, as this album leads from songs for the deaf, i also have to say, this is a really good album. Long slow goodbye, little sister, and in my head are really good songs, and someone's in the wolf, (another song on the album) is good. and practically every song is pretty good. I would say the worst song(s) are broken box, and you got a killer scene there man. Well, let's see what our surprise is on the next album......
0375424474|5.0|I am a proponent of interesting more young people in science and technology. Alas, most American youth attend public schools where teaching real science and technology is essentially unheard of.<br /><br />  Books like Neil Shubin's \\"Your Inner Fish\\" could go a long way in showing a young person just how fascinating science and technology can be, not to mention how vital scientists and technologists are to our nation's future.<br /><br />  Shubin brings a wonderful enthusiasm to his calling here which is to demonstrate that we humans owe what we are to the many, many animals that have preceeded us, including fish, worms, tadpoles, amphibians and reptiles. In short, we as humans are bits and pieces of almost all that has gone before us.<br /><br />  Shubin makes it all interesting as he traces the development of the human ear from the jawbones of fish. Or informs us that the human eye is only one manifestation of something far more fascinating: that the eye developed at all millions upon millions of years ago.<br /><br />  Shubin brings together paleontology, DNA and other specialties to show how science has developed and begun to unlock the mysteries of human evolution. For example, why do primates see in color when so many other animals don't? Shubin discusses a theory that may come as an interesting surprise to many. It did to me.<br /><br />  Why are human males prone to hernias? Hint: look inside sharks and other fish for the answer.<br /><br />  There is a richness in Shubin's book that is simply not found is most books on science. It is a beautiful thing to behold. He is never boring, never tedious and rarely uses polysylabic terms. This is science for the masses: fascinating, interesting and never dull. New facts on every page and never overwhelming.<br /><br />  Shubin makes science interesting and accessible and his book deserves to be in every public school classroom. Failing that, buy this book and give it to the young people in your family. You will be doing them, our nation and our world a great favor.<br /><br />JerryJerry
B000PKG6TE|4.0|Well, i have not completely listened to this album, but so far, i would give it a 4 star rating. 3s and 7s is a great song, turning on the screw is a great song, and make it with chu is really good. I also listened to suture up your future which is good, and that is all that i probably all i listened to so far. but do not judge this album so quickly, there could be more good songs, so i will remind myself to listen to it more. as i said before, queens of the stone age......   YOU ROCK!!!!!!
0743455967|5.0|Extremely helpful, AND entertaining.    I have developed tremendous respect for Stephen King as a writer, and this book was just one more reason for that.
0375847227|5.0|i have been reading some reviews on the books and i was shocked to see so many people putting up bad reviews. i first saw the movie the golden compass and i thought it was alright, but i knew the books would be 10 times better and i was right. i have read all three books three times each and i have read lyra's oxford just as many times. i dont belive for one minute that these books are anti-anything. if they were, it would be anti-cruel or evil. if you read these books with a closed mind then im sure thats why you have all those bad reviews.     i personally believe that there is so much mystery in the world and the christian reliogn doesnt explain everything throughly.    i believe that the books are full of adventure, love, trust, friendship and sorrow. i believe that if you have a wonderful imagination then this is definately the series for you.     throughout the whole series, it talks about how the church trys to supress anything good. but lyra and will discover that there are so many good things in the world. they discover love and friendship and i think that this series is abousutley wonderful and i would recomend it to anyone.
0739321005|3.0|listening to this audio book in my car created an intense curiosity to understand barack more. although this book is somewhat inspiring ,it truly reads like a long,drawn out novel at times giving too much information in one direction ,but not enough in others. of course I realize that it is incomplete, maybe I feel like the author jumped the gun to create this too soon. At certain points it feels rushed,then again It can appear evasive.. some chapters were entirely too verbose and I needed and auditory break.
B0010358CQ|2.0|Truly disappointing in so many ways it's hard to know where to start.  Dialogue - The worst aspect of this movie is the unbelievably horrible dialogue; so bad it will make you cringe.  Story - As others have noted, you get the feeling there were multiple writers for the story and they kept getting fired and only using half of the previous writers work; a few almost interesting points are brought up in the movie and then abandoned before they can be explored.  It should also be noted that the movie steals (without adding or improving) quite a lot from other movies, the matrix, the borg cube, etc.  Animation - While it's admittedly a nice clean HD transfer, the actual CG animation used looks like it's from one of the straight-to-video Barbie movies; half the time the characters move in a very unnatural, stilted way.    My recommendation:  instead of purchasing this, just watch the previous Appleseed movie again, it wasn't that great either, but much better than this.
0307237702|5.0|I've not the time nor inclination to go on a ten page ramble about this book, although given the time I certainly could. I'm far, far from a political activist. I've admired few politicians and respected fewer. I find myself a staunch believer in the leadership capacity and charisma of JFK. Then I read this book... and it's absolutely brilliant. Poetic, insightful, caring, compassionate, funny... real!<br /><br />Read this book and see how you feel. If only a fraction of this is authentic (and I get the sense it all is) this man is more qualified to lead this country than anyone crazy enough to take this job in many decades!
B000VUFJ4Q|5.0|Taylor Swifts new CD is her best CD, I love all of her songs,   Tim McGraw, Picture To burn, Cold As You, Stay Beautiful, Mary's Song, Our song, Should've Said No, Tied Together With A Smile, Teardrops on my Guitar, A Place In This World, The Outside. There all about Making up or breaking up. Something about her and her relation ships.  Her voice is amazing and pretty. She is very pretty. I love how it says in the back of her album at the bottom. PS: All of you boys that thought it would be funny to go and break my heart. Here are 11 songs about you. It's funny. I rate her CD a 5 because her songs are under standing, she is like 18 or 19 and I think she has been through many relation ships. If you like Miranda Lambert, Carrie Underwood, Sara Evans, Martina McBride, Then you'll Love Taylor Swift. That is why I convince you to buy or listen to her CD.   PS: So then you can also write a review about how much you fell in love with her CD.
B000001ELP|3.0|So, you're reading my review for this album, huh?     I don't think my opinion of this album will convince you to run out and buy it. You will probably do the same thing I did and buy it on a whim when it goes on sale.     After you buy it, you will start to listen and think, \\"Good Lord! This sucks!\\"     Give it time, friend. It took a few weeks for it to grow on me.    For starters, I recommend that you dump all preconceived notions of this being a \\"concept album.\\" If you go into it with the mindset of a storyline, you will be disappointed. The concept itself is weak. Most of the storyline is wasted on telling the tale of a boy who is trying to figure out if he is worthy to save the world from evil. (Yes, you are worthy. Now shut up, pick up your sword and go kill something!)    Musically, this is an experimental album for KISS. I know when it first came out back in 1981, I referred to it as \\"Music FOR My Elders.\\"     Having revisited the album, I have concluded it is not as bad as I thought it was. It's just not the album that gets cranked during the drive at 5PM on a Friday afternoon. It's more like the album I put on at 8:35PM while playing \\"Bejeweled\\" on the computer. (Yes, I live my life dangerously and on the edge.)    Here is what I have surmised, having finally given the album a 2nd chance:    1)Ace Frehley has the two best contributions on the album. \\"Dark Light\\" is omnious and heavy. The guitar solo alone is worth giving the track a listen to. \\"Escape from the Island\\" is an instrumental piece that further showcases Ace's talent for writing and performing solid music that creates imagery in the mind of the listener. (Just the sirens in the opening of the song makes me want to grab my stuff quick and get the hell out before something bad goes down.)     2)\\"The Oath\\" could have easily appeared on either \\"Creatures of the Night\\" or \\"Animalize.\\" It is a KISS/Paul Stanley rocker and it works well for the band.    3)The song \\"I\\" is positive and uplifting. It isfurther proof that Gene knows how to write anthems that are tailor made for sold out areans. It could easily be added to their set list nowadays and the fans would probably sing along, word for word.    Unfortunately, there are some serious stinkers on this album.    I would recommend that listeners skip \\"Under The Rose\\" and \\"Odyssey.\\" Trust me. \\"Odyssey\\" has the worst lyrics ever committed to paper.     Example of lyrics:Through the luminescent night                    On beams of neon light                    You and I in wing-ged flight    (Yeah, the rest of the song is just as bad. Can you taste the cheese yet?)    Admittedly, this album is not for everyone. However, if you consider yourself to be a musically open-minded person, you may come to enjoy it after a few listens.     It could have been worse. KISS could have put out an album about rock music being banned in a futuristic society run by Robotos.    Domo arigato to you, KISS, for not writing THAT concept album.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|Taylor Swift       I loved the Taylor Swift CD. She is my favorite singer. I used to not have a favorite but after listening to this CD I have finally figured it out. I would give this CD a 5. The reason that I give it a 5 is because I think anyone would love the songs on it. But anyone who listened to this CD would have to love Country. She has 13 songs on this CD and these are the names :{ these are not in order} 1. Tim McGraw 2.Picture to burn 3. Cold as you 4. A place in this world  5. Teardrops on my guitar  6. The outside  7. Tied together with a smile  8. Stay beautiful  9. Should v said no 10. Mary song  11. Our song             All of her songs are about boys. Either she has a crush on some boy or a boy doesn't notice her. Mostly about some boy she likes.         Taylor Swift is a great singer I don't care what anyone says. What I like about her is her music is also interesting if I don't like the words then I listen to the music. That's when I really start to like it. The music just gets me into the song then the words come to me, it's amazing! She's amazing!
0143038419|4.0|I guess I have been picking up God awful books lately because I finally liked this book.:) It helps that I have been to the places she has. Even an Ashram. I have done the whole Guru thing while I was very young and I think it took me back. I had similar feelings in certain situations and some I dont agree with her. For example I did not find Rome so charming but loved Venice. Anyways, it is no Pulitzer winner but an easy, enjoyable read.
B000002I53|5.0|If you are new to jazz music, this is a definite must own.  My third 'favorite thing' by J.C. and company right behind \\"A Love Supreme\\" & \\"Blue Train\\", this one is a no brainer.  In fact, out of the 800+ jazz CD's & records I now own (and growing daily), I would put these three recordings in my top 40 favorites without thinking twice.  With the one possible exception of Miles Davis, no other jazz musician is more responsible for this addiction of mine that started about six years ago.  For once jazz music seeped into my veins, my life truly changed forever.  This is one addiction that I don't ever wish to quit.<br /><br />Coltrane was blessed to have a trio of special cats playing behind him.  McCoy Tyner on piano, Elvin Jones on drums and Steve Davis on bass, the four of them play together like the L.A. Lakers did in the 80's - pure chemistry, pure magic... Tyner in particular, is something special on this one.  And to think, he's still at it today!<br /><br />This is Coltrane & Company at their peak.  This is jazz music at its finest, four solid tunes played divinely.  Hell, I could listen to \\"My Favorite Things\\" (and God knows I have!) a dozen times in a row and still never tire of it.  If this doesn't do it for you, then jazz music probably isn't your thing.
B00000DFSK|4.0|U2's music is legendary. Every single song they do is simply incredible. Every single album they do is simply amazing. They are that good.    This is the first official U2 best-of. Released in 1998 on Island, the set documents the band's early years, spanning (as the title says) the 1980-1990 period.    So how does this collection measure up?    Positives  -MOST OF THE BIG U2 HITS FROM THAT ERA ARE HERE! 'Pride (In The Name Of Love),' 'New Year's Day,' 'Where The Streets Have No Name' and 'With Or Without You' all appear on this set.  -You get underrated gems on here too. 'October (not listed in the track listing, because it is a hidden track),' 'The Unforgettable Fire' and 'Bad' all appear on this set.  -THE SOUND QUALITY IS EXCELLENT!    Negatives  -WHERE IS 'BULLET THE BLUE SKY' AND 'A SORT OF HOMECOMING'? These are great U2 songs that got some radio airplay back in the day, and yet, THEY ARE NOT ON HERE!!!  -And, they could probably fit on here too!    Overall, despite what's here, I can't give this more than four stars. But this is still highly recommended for the casual U2 fan looking for nothing more than the hits.    ENJOY!!!
B000OCXFCO|5.0|I've said it once, I've said it many time, and I'll say it once again, words just cannot describe how much I love Megadeth. They are one of the best thrash/speed metal bands of all time, and they're also one of my all time favorite metal bands as well, man I just can't praise them enough. Their eleventh full length release &#34;United Abominations&#34; (their first album with Roadrunner) is just absolutely incredible, in fact it's one of the best and I DO MEAN ONE OF THE BEST metal albums of 2007 as well as one of my favorites of 2007 too. I have highly anticipated this release, and I knew it would be great, in fact, this album has also become my third favorite Megadeth album, behind &#34;Rust In Peace&#34; (my all time favorite Megadeth album) and &#34;Peace Sells...But Who's Buying&#34; (my second favorite). &#34;United Abominations&#34; also marks a return to the band's classic thrash sound. It sounds like a combination of their three best albums from their glory days (&#34;Rust In Peace&#34;, &#34;Peace Sells...But Who's Buying&#34; and &#34;Countdown to Extinction&#34;). There is no other band in my humble honest opinion that has taken such a more political stance the way Megadeth have, and &#34;United Abominations&#34; is the band's most politically charged album, no questions asked.<br /><br />Frontman and mastermind Dave Mustaine has definitely brought back the complexity of the guitar work and the aggression on this album right here, and he's also brought back that angry snarl in his vocals as well. This album is just full of great head-snapping complex riffs and awesome ripping skull-searing solos played with precision, passion and fire throughout. Dave's guitar riffs and solos are just downright amazing as always. The man is an absolute genius, as well as being one of metal's all time best guitar shredders. Glen Drover's guitar work is awesome as well, and of course he does his excellent share of soloing. His playing style to me is very reminiscent of Marty Friedman's. Bassist James Lomenzo lays down some sick catchy bass lines, and Shawn Drover (brother of Glen BTW) does some excellent drumming throughout, especially with some wicked fast tempos thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />I love every song on this album, but here's a look at some of my favorites.<br /><br />The album opens up with a straight forward thrasher in &#34;Sleepwalker&#34; which is in my opinion, Megadeth's best song in years and my favorite song on the album. It starts off with an acoustic intro before going into full throttle with monster ripping riffs and Dave's trademark snarls. This song also features some wild awesome solos and some very cool lyrics for example: &#34;NO ONE IS SAFE, WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES, I'VE COME TO TAKE YOU ALIVE&#34;. The following track &#34;Washington is Next&#34; is another highlight on here that features fast thrashing riffs, some sick pulsating bass lines, and some wicked trail-blazing solo breaks by Dave and Glen in the middle. There's also some excellent double bass drumming by Shawn and I like when he slams down some fast pounding fills during the solo break. Track three &#34;Never Walk Alone...A Call to Arms&#34; is another great song that features catchy riffs especially during the chorus (which is catchy as well), and an excellent and I do mean EXCELLENT solo section in the middle with a nice clean interlude over some nice guitar harmonies. Next up, we have the title track which is definitely one of the best tracks on this album, as well as one of my favorites as well. This song features lyrics that talk about how the UN (United Nations) is undone. This song also features some bruising chugging riffs and a great melodic solo section in the middle. Track five &#34;Gears of War&#34; is another favorite on here that features all around solid heavy riffs, a catchy chorus and some great melodic soloing as well. Track seven &#34;Play for Blood&#34; is another stunning track that features excellent complex riffing, some solid double bass kick fill from Shawn, and also not to mention that Dave and Glen absolutely slaughter on this song with their dueling solos, and I believe there's over ten solos on this song if I'm not mistaken. The lyrics on this song are very cool too, and it goes to show that Dave brings such attitude to his lyrics, believe me this song is proof. Next we have &#34;A Tout Le Monde (Set Me Free)&#34; which is a nice solid remake of the original version (which is on the 1994 release &#34;Youthanasia&#34;). While I do like the original version more, this version is much more driven and more upbeat, and it also features Christina Scabbia of Lacuna Coil on guest vocals as well, a great song this is. Track nine &#34;Amerikhasten&#34; is a strong politically charged straight forward rocker that features angry vocals and lyrics from Dave, and more excellent soloing as well as some killer double bass kicks from Shawn. &#34;Burnt Ice&#34; is a ferocious album closer that starts off with some nice solo fills and some good mid tempo drumming by Shawn until he changes tempos especially around the 2:30 mark with lightning fast fills and there's also some great blazing solo breaks by Dave and Glen, especially that one solo by Dave near the end that's just ripping, blazing, thrashing and just destroys everything in it's path. What a great closer this one is.<br /><br />Jeremy's song ratings:<br />1. Sleepwalker (5:53) - 5/5 My favorite song<br />2. Washington is Next (5:19) - 5/5<br />3. Never Walk Alone...A Call to Arms (3:54) - 5/5<br />4. United Abominations (5:35) - 5/5<br />5. Gears of War (4:25) - 5/5<br />6. Blessed Are the Dead (4:02) - 5/5<br />7.

Burnt Ice (3:47) - 5/5<br /><br />Overall, if you're a fan of Megadeth, metal, thrash/speed metal, or if you're just into good music in general, then by all means, you must buy &#34;United Abominations&#34;. This album definitely goes to show that Megadeth are back and better than ever in a big time way, and yes this album is indeed proof.

0060558121|3.0|Neil Gaiman has long amazed people with his work in the comic book industry. His groundbreaking Sandman helped pave the way for the current mainstream acceptance of comic books as something not merely for children or meant to be an interest hidden from sight, so people did not judge you: Comics are suddenly more influential in the media, especially within the movie industry, than quite possibly any other creative form. When Gaiman crossed over into novels, many fans crossed over with him and his first novel, Neverwhere, met with some critical success.<br /><br />Here, Gaiman describes the present day, but a behind-the-scenes look if you will. The premise is interesting, something straight out of a comic: America is teeming with gods, both the old, brought over with various peoples when they first came over to the United States, and newer ones, representing the exponential growth in technology. At the center is a man named Shadow, who is just released from prison and is the most important player in this struggle between the old and the new.<br /><br />The plot is incredibly original and at the beginning, you really are drawn in. But then something goes awry: Gaiman creates an opportunity to dazzle us and really go into detail about these characters and creatures he has created, but instead leaves us with skeletal descriptions, leaning heavily on past conceptions of what these gods would have looked like in the present day. In some sense, you wonder if Gaiman's writing is too dependent on an artist that is not there to provide some sort of visual context.<br /><br />I myself bought this book because I needed a fast read, which Gaiman does provide. It's mainstream fiction, something meant to entertain, but not challenge in any way. I think my disappointment comes from the potential Gaiman's opening pages creates to the sudden drop off and lackluster ending. You want something bold and visionary and instead you are left with \\"bleh.\\"<br /><br />Read this when you need a break, but don't think that going in you're getting something along the lines of Ender's Game or even the Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />Some interesting quotes:<br /><br />\\"The room was freezing.

If you want blood.. - one of the best live rock recordings ever!!), the original remastered Oz edition of \\"Let There Be Rock\\" (circa 1992) should not be overlooked (assuming you can find it now!!) as it contains this classic, slow, bluesy masterpiece from Bon - think of it as an extension of 'The Jack' (same theme etc).  I prefer this Oz version of the album over the recent remastered version which deletes this (too racy/controversial for international audiences apparently - and \\"The Jack\\" wasn't???). Anyway, enjoy this album and play it loud - one of the best albums done by the boys and one of the best hard-rock albums period.  Even my hero, Dave Mustaine, has been quoted as having said that this AC/DC album ranks as one of his personal favourites - so it must be that good coming from the King of Thrash himself. Thanks for reading.  Can't wait for the new AC/DC album and the promised extensive tour of their homeland - Oz.  Cheers, Mark

0618918248|1.0|\\"None of Dawkins's loud pronouncements on God follows from any experiment or piece of data. It's just Dawkins talking.\\"    In the January 11, 2007 Issue of the New York Review Of Books, H Allen Orr disects this book and finds it empty. The book relies on a philosophical \\"proof\\" that God doesn't exist that is flawed. By \\"a mental Judo Move\\" Dawkins tries to turn the argument-from-design on its head, by claiming that                          \\"any God capable of designing anything would have to be complex enough to demand (an explanation of who designed him)\\"      In other words, The argument from design (the probability of life evolving from nothing is like a tornado whipping through a junkyard and assembling a 747. It's possible but vanishingly improbable) which relies on probability,  doesn't consider the designer, which would have to be even less probable than the 747.  Dawkins treats this like a knock-out blow when actually it's just a rehash of a number of old tropes.     The second half of the book is a full-on diatribe against religion, painting it pitch black without any acknowledgement of the positive aspects of religion in life and society. Orr, the reviewer, says     \\"The most disappointing feature of The God Delusion is Dawkins's failure to engage religious thought in any serious way. This is, obviously, an odd thing to say about a book-length investigation into God. But the problem reflects Dawkins's cavalier attitude about the quality of religious thinking. Dawkins tends to dismiss simple expressions of belief as base superstition.\\"     By calling agnostics & athiests who don't attack religion \\"Neville Chamberlains,\\" he implies that fundamentalists are Nazis and the agnostics are weak-minded pacifiers.     He has a point:  Fundamentalists exhibit the same zeal and certainty, and the rhetoric (if not yet, the action) is just as violent and hate-filled. Should we steel ourselves for battle with half-truths, and face the enemy with stern moral certainty? Perhaps.
B0000TB05A|5.0|Well, i'm not a huge U2 fan, but i am a fan of the Edge's guitar work. The sound on this dvd was mastered very well. The music is top notch. I have the U2 live at boston for the elevation tour dvd, and it was horrible compared to this one. This is personally my favorite U2 concert Dvd, although i have yet to see Rattle and Hum (WHICH I MUST SEE, i love the album). Angel of Harlem, is a great tune. Pick up this dvd you wont be disapointed. I played it so much, it got scratched beyond playability, so i bought another copy. Thats how much i liked it!!!!!
B000H305U0|4.0|I really waited a long time before I succumbed to listening to this album, feeling that Timberlake had been less than noble by not publicly supporting Janet Jackson following the faux pas that was the halftime of Super Bowl XXXVIII or A.K.A. \\"Boobygate.\\" I couldn't bring myself to give young Justin a try.<br /><br />It wasn't until I saw a video on YouTube of Timberlake's \\"Sexyback\\" accompanying scenes from the primetime soap \\"Dallas\\" that I began to hear him in a different light. Later, I saw his video to \\"My Love\\" and the moves of him and his dancers were quite eye-catching. Next, I saw one of his appearances on SNL and saw that there was a comic talent behind that pop/hip-hop persona.<br /><br />Then, it wasn't until I discovered that he was the auteur behind \\"Until the End of Time,\\" one of the best R & B songs of last year, I then said to myself, \\"OK! He's a tad more than just Britney's ex!\\"<br /><br />After having heard the entire album, I can say that it has something that appeals to a wide spectrum of the listening public. There's enough of the old (the 70's-funk sounding \\"Sexy Ladies,\\" for example) intertwined with the new (\\"Chop Me Up,\\" among others) to satisfy the kids, their parents, and, possibly the younger grandparents.<br /><br />Granted, the use of a couple of expletives could have been eliminated, along with the ridiculously out-of-place \\"Damn Girl,\\" the one track that sounds like a holdover from the singer's 'NSYNC days. Using profanity is not necessarily a sign of maturity but \\"kids\\" tend to think that it is.<br /><br />Overall, \\"\\"FutureSex/Lovesound,\\" while not one of the great pop albums of all time, is definitely a keeper and shows a talent that, with a couple of more years, may develop into a something more than \\"the flava of the month,\\" just as long as he matures vocally and doesn't remain in one niche.
B00009ZYBY|1.0|This movie lost all credibility, and me, after the first battle scene between the Romans and the Germans when the Germans were chanting in Zulu.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure that whoever did the sound editing on this film was high when they inserted that little gem.<br /><br />It sounded great at Rourkes Drift*, but really stupid in the German forest.<br /><br />I assumed that from that point onward the film would go downhill accordingly...and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />* The movie was \\"Zulu\\" with Michael Caine, Stanley Baker and Jack Hawkins.
0810994739|4.0|This second volume of \\"Wimpy Kid\\" stories is just as compulsively readable as the first, once again giving us a glimpse into the world of Greg Heffley, a typical, terrible preteen American kid.<br /><br />This volume focuses more attention on Greg's rotten older brother, Roderick, and delves deeper into their ongoing sibling warfare.  One weekend, Roderick throws a \\"Risky Business\\"-style house party when the 'rents go out of town (and locks his little brother in the basement so he won't get in the way...) but Greg gets in trouble anyway, just because that's the way it works when you're a kid.  Meanwhile, he's up to his usual hijinks at school and at home: Greg becomes popular after inventing a way to psychologically torture another kid by getting the whole school to pretend he doesn't exist; he has ongoing difficulty understanding why his durfy pal Rowley is so popular with the girls, and he frets endlessly that Roderick will \\"out\\" him over an embarrassing incident that happened over Summer vacation... Greg gives Roderick all kinds of power over him all year long (and won't tell us what happened, until the very end) and of course it turns out to be hardly anything at all -- just the kind of thing that a preteen kid would agonize over, although the panic doesn't really translate into the adult world.<br /><br />I have to admit, this series got to be a little exhausting after a while, although I read it from start to finish, unable to put it down.  It's just that I had this nagging feeling that I should chase that kid away or call the cops or something... And what the heck is a twelve-year-old doing going out trick-or-treating, anyway?  What a rotten kid! What a funny book! (ReadThatAgain children's book reviews)

B000TKW3E2|5.0|Dario Marianelli beautifully captures the atmosphere that is `Atonement'.  He understands the concept behind this novel/film and he masterfully creates the most beautifully intricate companion piece I've heard in quite a long time.  He takes a stunning, seductive and mesmerizing score and then builds on it with very imaginative and complex creativity.  The fact that he incorporates typing into the music (in ode to the fact that the perils of this film all stem from a little `story') is a flawless and admirable decision.  Marianelli's score is probably the most beautiful and intoxicating musical piece I've ever heard; honestly.<br /><br />The score opens with `Briony', which sets the pace for the rest of the score.  It rises and falls and then swiftly runs into the somber piece `Robbie's Letter' which carries along with it a feeling of dread which then manifests itself when `Two Figures By a Fountain' begins with it's interweaving resemblance to `Briony'.  It builds itself up until it explodes only to lead into the soft and breathtaking `Cee, You and Tea'.<br /><br />I could go on and on but the point here is that each track is a marvelous compliment to the one before and the one after; all of them coming together to create a perfectly cohesive piece; united and courageous.<br /><br />Tracks like `With My Own Eyes' expose a layer of fragility within a seed of corruption.  As the typing rapidly increases we can feel the lie building within young Briony Tallis. In stark contrast we have the marvelously constructed `Farewell' which exudes longing and heartache, and while they differ so much they fit together so masterfully.  The piano work in `Love Letters' is dreamlike and is elevated all the more by the breathtaking violins that accompany it.<br /><br />Tracks like `The Half Killed' subtly rise in power and grace that about halfway through you are stunned at its immortal presence.  It falls into the smooth flutes of `Rescue Me' only to be heightened yet again by the commanding `Elegy for Dunkirk' which brings to mind one of the most memorable scenes in the film.  `Elegy...' weaves itself beautifully into `Come Back' which works itself back around to the memorable `Briony' before moving onto the beautiful `Denouement'.  `The Cottage on the Beach' and finally `Atonement' beautifully close out this miraculous score.<br /><br />The final track, `Clair de Lune', is performed by Jean Yves-Thibaudet and add a layer of authentic beauty to the collection, bringing us into the Tallis home and making us a part of their story.<br /><br />As a whole Marianelli's score is beautiful, exotic, seductive, enticing, warm and fragile; a beautiful composition that compliments its source material by understanding it and working to become a part of it.  This is truly a score that exemplifies everything the novel/film represents.' which brings to mind one of the most memorable scenes in the film.  `Elegy...' weaves itself beautifully into `Come Back' which works itself back around to the memorable `Briony' before moving onto the beautiful `Denouement'.  `The Cottage on the Beach' and finally `Atonement' beautifully close out this miraculous score.

0345494768|5.0|I am not reviewing this book based on the content as I did not purchase it to read.  I purchased it as a gift for my husband - a Star Wars fan from his youth.    I'm sure this book would make a great gift for the hardcore Star Wars fans (although I expect they would have already purchased it for themselves.) I would particularly like to recommend this book as a gift to more casual fans of Star Wars and fans of books on the film industry in general.  My husband has read quite a few Star Wars books, but has said that this is among the most interesting of the non-fiction books he has read on the topic and he was constantly stopping me to read quotes from the book on various aspects of the production history.    It's a very heavy, very large book and makes great presentation on the coffee table - much too nice to be left sitting on a shelf.  :)
1569242739|5.0|I bought this after I got the Veganomicon as a gift.  Yep, I'm not a vegan or vegetarian (yet?) but was so impressed with the dessert recipes in the Veganomicon that I wanted more.      This cupcake book definitely delivers.  I'm no chef, but with all the delicious, easy and unique recipes in here I could start a bake sale revolution.  :)    Some products used in a few recipes are harder to find than others - particularly for someone who is not used to shopping vegan, such as agar agar and some alternative flours, but there are so many other fantastic cupcake recipes, I haven't even needed to experiment with those yet.    This is highly recommended for delicious cupcakes with a twist.  I particularly love the low fat vanilla cupcakes... perfect for my struggling-to-stay-health-conscious family.
B000002J1U|4.0|This is head and shoulders above the previous two releases even if one is apt to hear more from the former two on the radio. While the first two albums tried hard and often overdid it, this album finds the band settling into a comfort level, spreading out, and demonstrating the kind of diversity and damn the torpedoes attitude that would come to define their uniqueness. While I am curious as to the sagacity of delineating so clearly the hard side and soft side (whereas IV/Zoso intermixed the loud with the quiet), there is no doubt that LZ III was their best effort to date. Plant's Norseman's wail and the thundering gallop of \\"Immigrant Song\\" knocks you backward as is typical of Zeppelin's opening numbers and from there it only gets better. \\"Friends\\" is one of my top five favorites, and the straight-forward blues of \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" is about as genuine and defining as this band ever did the curious stepchild of the blues which owed as much to the American masters of the genre as it did to the heavily amplified and excessive machismo of the British electrified interpretation.   The songs are nearly all exceptional with the only misstep being the closer \\"Hats Off To (Roy) Harper\\" which is a bit too clever for its own good. The second half of the album features the more acoustic influences of Page and Plant and allows the listener to hear how diverse and capable this band was, and in particular, how Page's studio experiences and varied influences allowed this band to separate itself from its Yardbirds roots and forge a path that no band had yet traversed. As this album clearly underscores, the genealogy of this band were clearly broader than Robert Johnson and Willie Dixon.   Along with the follow-up and Physical Graffiti, this is an essential release from Led Zeppelin.
B000UCEJEQ|3.0|The title previews the music.  The songs are powerful and intense, at times I needed a rest.
B00133KFGW|5.0|First of all I want to make it clear that I absolutely loved this movie.  The story is very beautiful and moving.  But the key to enjoying this movie is to realize that it is a fairy tale and not a typical drama or thriller.  Anyone familiar with musical theater or opera are used to suspending their normal skepticism to unlikely or even impossible plot situations and instead enjoying the heightened emotional reality that is portrayed.  This movie is not about clever plot twists or dialogue.  It is about the power of music and of love.  Those ideas are more important than even the characters in this movie.  For those of you who can not stomach the idea of that, then this movie is not for you.  But for those of you who enjoyed \\"Across the Universe,\\" \\"Big Fish,\\" \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" hey, even \\"Il Postino\\" then you will probably have the artistic maturity to enjoy this film.    Being a professional musician and music teacher gave me in an interesting perspective on this film.  On the one hand, I can fully appreciate what the character Evan is implying with his line \\"The music is all around you, all you have to do is listen.\\"  Music is simply sound, repeating vibrations in the air that are caused by all things that move.  Our music was at some point in the beginning derived from the sounds of nature, and I could tell that the composer tried to make the soundtrack sound initially more \\"natural\\" by using a lot of open octaves and fifths, the kind of harmony that is by far most prevalent in nature.  I was also deeply touched by the idea that the music \\"of one's soul\\" could attract another person.  The ancient Greeks believed in \\"the music of the planets\\" and the music of one's soul, in addition to our \\"audible\\" music.  The philosophers Plato, Boethius, Aristotle and others  came up with the \\"doctrine of ethos\\" which lies at the heart of this movie: that the harmonies of nature and the mind are inter-related with and affect the harmonies we create and enjoy in music.  The fact that music alone can elicit emotions in us proves that at least some of this ancient philosophy is true.    On the other hand, listening in closer to the soundtrack leaves me a little disappointed.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers is just barely good enough of a singer to get by as a professional musician--even for a rock singer--and his versions of \\"Moondance\\" and \\"Something Inside\\" start to sound like open mic at a karaoke night.  And I was sad to listen later to \\"August's Rhapsody\\" and find it is full of cinematic music cliche's and uninspired harmonic movement.  But I did not notice any of these things when I watched the movie (which is amazing for me) because of the effectiveness of the gestalt of the movie.  With a little effort to curb a desire to nit-pick, I enjoyed this movie so much that I would say it is one of the best I have ever seen.
B000JBWWBK|5.0|THE MOVIE,A GOOD YEAR ,IS A WONDERFULFUL ESCAPE ROM THE GREY RAINY DAYS OF WASHINGTON.  THERE WAS FRANCE, PLENTY OF MONEY,WINE, GOOD LOOKING PEOPLE,AND OF COURSE THE CHATEAU.

B0013FXWVU|5.0|When Ron Howard's version of \\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\\" was released in 2000, I was amazed at the artistry, with the world of Dr. Seuss being brought to life through whimsical sets, creative make up and costumes, and impressive special effects. But even then, it still didn't feel entirely Seussian; the limits of live action filmmaking were present from the start. Such a problem doesn't exist in the case of \\"Horton Hears a Who!\\" a computer animated cartoon that looks and feels exactly the way a Seuss story should look and feel. Of the three films made from his material, this is the first one that completely convinced me to believe what I was seeing. It's also the only one with compelling characters and deeper levels of story. This is wonderful because it tells me that the filmmakers had all audiences in mind, not just children.    \\"Grinch\\" alumnus Jim Carrey voices the title character, a happy-go-lucky elephant living in the lush jungle of Nool. On the fifteenth of May, his big ears detect noises from a speck of dust floating in the air. It soon lands atop a fuzzy pink flower called a clover, and at that point, Horton realizes that the noises are actually voices. It turns out that the speck contains the microscopic city of Whoville, the home of the equally microscopic Whos. Theirs is a world fully realized, a world of misshapen buildings and swirling clouds and wacky gizmos, all of which are perfectly suited for such a bizarre-looking population. The limbs of the Whos are a little too thin and lanky. Their stomachs are a little too round. Their heads are a little too big. This is exactly the way they should look--when it comes to Dr. Seuss, odder is definitely better.    Horton soon makes contact with the Mayor of Whoville (voiced by Steve Carell), who not only has a city to run, but also has his hands full with a wife (voiced by Amy Poehler) and ninety-seven children (ninety-six of which are daughters). The upshot of this is negative for both main characters.No one in Horton's world believes that voices are emanating from a speck, least of all Kangaroo (voiced by Carol Burnett), an uptight woman who only believes in what she can see, hear, and touch. Likewise, not a single Who believes that their Mayor is communicating with an invisible elephant living in the sky. It all basically boils down to belief--just because you can't see something doesn't mean it isn't there.    As the Mayor struggles to maintain his city--recently plagued by tremors and immediate changes in climate--Horton remains determined to keep the Whos safe because, \\"A person's a person, no matter how small.\\" Unfortunately, he has to deal with Kangaroo, who finds his line of thinking so threatening that she hires a ruthless vulture named Vlad (voiced by Will Arnett) to destroy the clover. Consider the fact that Horton's basic goal is to keep a flower safe from harm: In what way does this pose a threat to jungle life, seeing as Horton never once asked for anyone else's help? Obviously, there's no threat at all. Kangaroo is merely a control freak, demanding that others believe what she believes without stopping to question the status quo. The Mayor of Whoville has a similar problem with his elected officials, who overstep their bounds frequently and with no apology. Apparently, they would rather die than let the Mayor postpone the upcoming Who-centennial.    In case I haven't made it clear by now, yes, \\"Horton Hears a Who!\\" is in part a social commentary. But don't sell it short--it's above all a delightful family film, and probably one of the funniest of recent memory. There's a sequence in which Horton imagines he's in an episode of \\"Pokémon,\\" fighting off the bad guys with martial-art moves; the Japanese-style animation in traditional 2-D was absolutely hilarious. I also enjoyed the plethora of side characters, all of which add their own comedic touches to the story. Horton's best friend is a blue mouse named Morton (voiced by Seth Rogen), and his tailends in an odd curlicue, as is appropriate for a Dr. Seuss character. There's also an odd but cute yellow puffball named Katie (voiced by Joey King), who tries to go along with Horton by holding a clover of her own: \\"In my world, everyone's a pony, and they all eat rainbows and poop butterflies!\\"    The most prominent side character in Whoville is the Mayor's only son, JoJo. He's a brooding young man who refuses to speak to his father, not because he doesn't love him, but because he's afraid of being a disappointment. He's expected to become Mayor someday--like his father and his father's father and so on--and this is something he just doesn't want to do. Little does he realize just how important he is, not only to his family, but also to the entire city of Whoville.    As good as these characters are, there's no question that Horton is the best thing about the movie. He's a funny character, yet his personality isn't overshadowed by pure goofiness. He's loyal to those who are kind, yet he doesn't reject those who are not. He's loveable, yet he's not forced to take part in sappy subplots. Everything about the big fella is just right, and the same can be said for the movie as a whole. \\"Horton Hears a Who!\\" is the best Dr. Seuss adaptation yet, and it will probably be one of the year's best animated films; it's funny, smart, heartfelt, and engaging, a welcome combination for a film that easily could have been just another mindless cartoon. What we have here is rare: A family film that both children and adults will love. This elephant really is faithful one hundred percent.

0486409511|5.0|This book is wonderful!  Mt daughter got interested in calligraphy after a project in school about colonial America.  I bought this book for her to try to learn one of the styles of that period.  It was a bit much for her, but I became fascinated by it and quickly began to improve my own penmanship.  This style of writing is not the easiest form of calligraphy out there, and I wouldn't reccommend it for someone just learning to use a calligraphy pen, but after a little practice holding the pen and some basic calligraphy like unical or roman, an older child or adult will find this a very helpful book.
0060090383|5.0|I am a Marian Keyes junkie, and \\"Rachel's Holiday\\" was one of my favorite. Marian Keyes gives us the laughter and enjoyment of Chic Lit- but with a brain. I hate the typical Chic Lit books that discuss page after page of shopping and how sad they are because they can't afford Dolce and Cabana. Keyes addresses all the funny issues we can relate to such as the bad haircuts, waiting by the phone for him to ring us, body image issues, and many our hidden insecurities. Rachel's Holiday addresses the serious issue of depression and drug abuse while giving us some laughs at the same time. She also doesn't fail to give us a fantastic romantic lead. Another issue that I liked about this book was that they addressed Rachel's sensitivity to the world. Her highly sensitive nature and insecurities are what lead her to begin her drug addiction. And yet she proved to us that highly sensitive persons such as Rachel are loved and rewarded with a great man who loved her just the way that she is. Unfortunately she met him long after her cocain habit began and it takes a long time for her to face reality.
B000001ESF|5.0|Review no. 280. First thrilled hard rock fans in spring, 1976 - as this was of course, the Canadian power trio's 4th release as it was also their make-or-break album. Believe I may even still have my vinyl copy of this record, but it's sure nice to have the remastered CD as well. Tunes that most (if not all) true Rush fans will never grow tired of are the fantastic twenty-minute sonic opener \\"2112 Overture / The Temple Of The Syrinx\\", the awesome \\"Twilight Zone\\" and the high-energy rocker \\"Something For Nothing\\". Also liked \\"Tears\\", wow! It really has been awhile since I've heard this disc. Highly recommended.
0743455967|5.0|For a how-to book and instructions on how to get started, why not take advice from a man who is making millions from his craft? Most of the books about writing seem to be written by those authors who have published few books and they all seem to be page after page of rambling. And who is not interested in reading an autobiography of the King of Horror? I had no idea that he grew up in poverty and was such a family man and loving husband. I am still way too scared to read most of his books, but he is the master of his craft. His advice is the best that I have read so far of any book about writing.
B0002PZVH0|4.0|Ha-ha! Really get a big laugh out of that patron who put on a one-star review of this CD reissue - asking 'what is this stuff, Chinese water torture?' No, Bubba! It's clearly ambient bliss for most of us. Originally released in 1978 - has it really been thirty years now since this electronics / ambient classic had surfaced? Two tracks here that I got the most out of was the sixteen-minute soundscape piece of brilliance \\"1/\\" and the twelve-minute \\"2/2\\". Line-up: Brian Eno-synthesizer & piano, Robert Wyatt-piano, Christine Gomez & Inge Zeininger-vocals and the late great Konrad Plank-engineer. Definitely recommended.
1594489505|5.0|I highly recommend this book for those who want a good page turner, and to empathize with the trials and tribulations of the women in Afganistan. It is true that this novel was absolutely depressing and not a barrel of laughs, but the women who are struggling to live each miserable day at a time in Afganistan need their voices to be heard. My boyfriend visited the country in 2005 and the streets were still infested with Burqas from the photos that I have seen.     Unfortunately, Marian's mother was right about the lesson of endurance. Women who were forced into such abusive marriages had no choice but to learn to endure the pain or commit suicide. And countless of women have unfortunately chosen the second option.The Taliban claimed that a husband has the right to treat his wife as he pleases, and it was shown clearly in the novel. These women are powerless; especially during the Taliban rule. A womans happiness and survival was solely dependent upon the men in their lives. Self-suffiency was not possible and still is not today in most cases.     It is hard to imagine how Marian survived all of those years living with Rasheed before Laila arrived. Laila and her children were a new blessing in her life. In her case, a second wife was a blessing. Many women residing in patriarchial countries with an abusive husband do not have the luxury of a second wife or companion to help cope with the hardships. At first,Laila had a chance for happiness due to her luck of having such a loving, and liberal father, but of course tragedy struck her household. As I personally witnessed in a Muslim country that I previously visited- a womans dress, education, and freedoms depend solely on the father that raised them, and what was \\"allowed\\" by him or her husband. There still is much progression to be made. I am thankful that Hosseini cares to educate the world of the obstacles and misery endured by the women of his country. Hopefully, someday Afganistan will be the lovely country that he remembers from his childhood before the Soviet Invasion. He delivers two strong and brave characters from this novel who learned to survive during such hardships. Hopefully there are more and more women like these characters who are returning to Afganistan and helping make the country a better place for the future generation to come.

0978607651|5.0|If you like spare,abstract, but still realistic to the object illustration, you'll find nothing like Parker this side of Japanese scroll paintings. The book is a testament to a little known American master illustrator and the abstracted illustrations of real life things that were and will continue to be inspiration for anyone that takes the time to really look.
B000AYEL6U|3.0|Have not completely seen it yet, but I loved Wives and Daughters so I purchased this film due to the excellent author.  I will do a more intense review later, so far it looks very good.  Not as fancy as Wives and Daughters, you know us ladies love the period films for their lovely gowns, countryside and sweet romances.  I also like Charles Dickens so I go from one to another.  Thanks
B000W4HFY8|5.0|This is the first: in this world it will always be the blond leading the blind. TWIN PEAKS is a case study of great creativity getting gummed up by meddling TV executives and accountants taking more important decisions than directors. After a phenomenal first season, (against David Lynch's wishes) Laura Palmer's murder  got solved in mid second season, effectively killing the impetus of the show. What was left, was a show that was too slow in finding a new direction, decelerating into vapid style and enjoying a huge cult following that is still going strong. I should know; I am a huge fan since the first time I laid eyes on Snoqualmie Falls.<br /><br />This the second: your favorite childhood gum can never taste the same again. This OST reflects the shows decline in Season 2. It contains only a handful of original tunes; most tracks are reprises of Angelo Badalamenti's dreamy music. To TWIN PEAKS fans, this is a treasure chest full of timeless gems, bringing back memories of Maddy's misfortune and James' adventures. No unique tunes, though, and nothing to rival the original and timeless Love Theme.<br /><br />And now for the third Truth: seek for the secret before the beginning.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED!
B000MG1ZFQ|4.0|\\"The Soft Parade\\" is usually regarded as the least successful Doors album with Jim Morrison. You get the impression the the band was in need of enough good material and some of the better songs are partly ruined by too heavy orchestrations. So by Doors standards it may not be a great album, but this does not make it a bad album at all.<br /><br />The two opening tracks \\"Tell All the People\\" and \\"Touch Me\\"are both great songs, though I would have preferred gentler arrangements. But the Doors were obviously seeking new grounds at this point of their career. \\"Shaman's Blues\\" is back to the classical Doors sound. A very good track!<br /><br />\\"Do it\\" is also close to being classical Doors, though not really a very interesting track.. The same could be said about \\"Easy Ride\\", which comes out pretty lightweight.<br /><br />\\"Wild Child\\" is a bluesy track, not unlike the style of their final album \\"L.A. Woman\\" - though not one of their best blues songs.<br /><br />Fortunately the last three tracks are the Doors at their best. \\"The Running Blues\\" is varied song very different musical parts; and a charming vocal performance by Robbie Krieger in the country-break.<br /><br />\\"Wishful Sinful\\" is a great pop-song and the second single to be taken from the album.<br /><br />The long title track is a suite of different musical parts, of which most are really great. Fortunately this great finale was allowed to be just the Doors - no outside orchestration.<br /><br />\\"Welcome to the Soft Parade\\"

0723257639|5.0|I have actually owned this set of books for almost 40 years and have read them repeatedly to my children (and myself). This new set is for one of my children and her new baby. Her fond memories of this series prompted her request for the books rather than some other baby item that some might have considered more \\"practical\\". As you can see, I have raised my children to have their priorities in order. No family, whether they have children or not, should be without this classic of children's literature!
1582701709|2.0|Ok, I'm a writer, I've got two and a half Master's Degrees and I read all the time, so on vacation down in Malibu I bought this book because of all the hype and began reading. To my surprise (and disappointment) I found that all it is is a bunch of other people's quotes gathered together for inspiration. I worked in advertising in New York City and I learned you can't just promise something, your product has to deliver. THERE IS NO DAMN SECRET in this book, just the basic premise that if you put good energy out, good energy will come your way. Wow...astounding...Shame on you Rhonda Byrne for thinking the general public is really that stupid. A good MAC lipgloss would do me more good than this book and it would have cost me less! I gave my copy to a homeless guy. Maybe Rhonda can help him find his dream home!
0743298039|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have ever read! I loved it so much that once I was done with it I needed more!

B00005JK8K|3.0|Windtalkers: a story of a young Navajo Codetalker, fighting on the battlegrounds of Saipan.  Windtalkers: Woo's pathetic attempt to elevate Native Americans from Hollywood's Tonto.  So, why give this movie three stars?  The actors in this movie were superb.<br />Newcomer, Adam Beach (and his gorgeous smile) did a fine job holding his own against co-star Nicholas Cage (whose slight eye and body movements were underscored by a terrible score).  Lovable Mark Ruffalo zips in and out of scenes, provoding a strong character you pray makes it home alive.  There are also numerous cameos and small roles given to the old-timers like Peter Stormare and Jason Isaacs add to the movie's strong cast.<br />While it is obvious that Woo had military consultants, he cheapened it with Hollywood melodrama. There where too many over-the-top war scenes: rolling while simutaneously shooting, arm flailing deaths, and the curses at comrades between gurgling mouthfulls of blood.  The abrupt closeups throughout the movie add wonderful cheese; it was perhaps the best special effect in the whole movie!  The score's cliche cords threatened to overpower the actors and hindered the movie greatly.  Let's not forget about the historically askew storyline, in which Marines are charged with killing codetalkers should they be caputred; it cheapens the history of the U.S. Marine Corps and Native American Codetalkers.<br />If you're looking for a historically acurate (or close to acurate) drama, Windtalkers is not it.  I wouldn't buy this movie, but it's worth the money at Blockbuster.  For now, the world still waits for a good movie about Native American codetalkers.
0439895294|5.0|To call this a picture book is to limit the feast to a single item.  This masterpiece has many layers and nourishes from the very young to beyond wise elders.  An individual will enjoy total immersion and a group will be supplied with discussion items for as much time as available.  This should be listed in the United States award columns.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|If your a SG1 fan and a collector of the season's series then this is a must have. The story is right on track with what you expect in action and adventure. I watch this on a Toshiba HD A-2 with the upconversion for regular DVD's and the picture quality is almost equal to HD quality.
B001041JLE|4.0|First of all i am a big fan of Michael Jackson. I own all the DVD collections and audio collections ever done my Michael. I was really amazed upon receiving this new special edition CD.   It also comes with a DVD, but has only a few videos in it, It would have been nice if they have included the complete video set from the thriller album including the making of Thriller videos.     The CD quality is amazing, plays perfect with crystal clear sound on my BOSE Car Stereo.
B000EPR7NE|4.0|I collect movie soundtracks.Some of my favorite composers are Jerry Goldsmith, James Horner, John Barry, James Newton Howard  to name a few off the top of my head.  I love the movie music of Hans Zimmer. On occasion I will get one that has only  one or two tracks that I listen to repeatedly. However,on \\"The DaVinci Code\\", I have enjoyed almost all of it.   There is only one track that I forward past. It's kind of creepy.   I have been listening to this CD while working  on my computer; I especially like the choral music that seems to be in much of the background. I wish the crescendo on the 1st and third track had been muted somewhat; I worry about what it's doing to my little speakers.   This has become one of my favorite Zimmer recordings. I have to force myself to change the disc so that I dont get tired of it.  That almost happened with \\"The Gladiator\\", both the first CD and \\"More Music from the Gladiator\\" with bits of  dialogue.

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|When you reach a certain age, romantic comedies have no ring of truth to them.  This movie is different.  It is about shared passion - musical passion - shared loss, shared friendship - and unrealized love...because adults cannot usually indulge in love.    This movie acknowledges the pain of love - and still makes you want to go for it.  It is real - and really - what more can you ask of a movie?
0452289963|5.0|\\"A New Earth\\" is an amazing book! It speaks of a shift in consciousness-a kind of awakening that is possible and is happening now throughout the planet.     In order for us to grow and evolve in spirit, we as a species need to change our thinking from that rooted in ego to that inspired by our inner Being. In an inspiring account Tolle presents the dazzling potential  of not only personal transformation but also transformation of our planet.     I definitely recommend this book, which goes nicely with another book on spiritual transformation: \\"[[ASIN:0978107004 Nexus: A Neo Novel]]\\"
B000UFAURI|5.0|Having never been much of a FF fan I was skeptical about buying the whole album. I had heard \\"The Pretender\\" and \\"Long Road To Ruin\\" so with 2 really good songs at least, I took a chance. Now it's my current favorite album and one that I'm positive I'll keep in my collection forever.  Not many bands or musicians release albums like this anymore and with Foo Fighters history and credibility being a major factor (how many grammy's have they won now?), I'm curious to see what the future holds for these guys!
1594481717|5.0|This book connects the reader with a wide ranging variety of areas. It opens one to re-imagining the world and people around us. He suggests music to listen to, books to read, web sites to visit and people to engage. He recounts his personal process in search of an answer: how do we conceive the world? It doesn't tilt into: How we Should conceive the world.
B000JMK6LC|5.0|Anyone in their teens when the attack on the World Trade Center occurred should vividly remember seeing the images on our televisions at our homes, schools, caf&eacute;s, etc.  I know I will never forget sitting in my classroom that morning and watching the live reports and coverage.  However, what makes this film more than just a playback of tragedies past, it offers a fresh, unique perspective on the event by retelling the story from the point of view of a pair of brave fire fighters.  It is a story of friendship and loyalty, bravery and courage, and above all... a country in the face of adversity.<br /><br />No matter what kind of genres you enjoy, this is definitely a must-have for anyone who even vaguely remembers September 11, 2001.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|If you liked the series, you will like this movie.  I can't wait for the next one!

0060776579|5.0|I really enjoyed this audiobook. I do not know if this book will help me in becomming a millionaire, but there are very good hints and tips in this book. The chapters which gives you information about how to look on your financials, how to split the monthly income in different buckets with clear purposes and the clear explanations about the passive and active income I consider them very valuable.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|My husband and I loved Northanger Abbey!  We watch it at least twice a month!  The casting of the actors was perfect!
B00005JKC3|3.0|The Hulk movie was definitely underrated.  The movie was about 30-45 minutes too long and dragged at parts but the action was awesome.  The CGI Hulk was incredible and looked much more real in the film than on previews.  This is a good movie when you have over 2 hours to kill and there's not much else on.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|My husband and I are VERY selective about the movies we purchase.  Some so often disappoint with crude language, violence, and/or nudity.  This one delighted us with superb acting and casting.  The only critical remark would be that we had to put the volume so loud to hear the whispers that were pertinent to the story.
0765357151|3.0|I Am Legend is great book that can really make one think for a long time.  It has a great ending that has yet to be captured in any of the films made of the book, The Last Man on Earth(1964), The Omega Man(1972), and I am Legend(2007).  I am Legend was surprisingly short, coming in at 160 pages.  The rest of the book is filled with some of Richard Matheson's short stories which I could have done without.  I would have easily given the book another star or two had the short stories not been included because they were just plain bad.  A lot of them started off well just to disappoint at the end and the rest were just bad from start to finish.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I KNEW FROM THE FIRST SCENE THAT I WAS WITNESSING TRUE ART AT IT'S FINEST.

THE WORLD NEEDS MORE OF THIS AND LESS GORE AND GUTS FROM THE PHONIES IN HOLLYWOOD.

B000002J5K|5.0|The Blues Brothers do it again with their second album to go along with their big screen debut.

When you add greats like Ray Charles, Cab Calloway, and Aretha Franklin how can you go wrong?
0385333846|3.0|This book is overrated. Although it is interesting and I couldn't put it down, I found that its standing as a perennial anti-war book is undeserved. Sledge, in With the Old Breed, had a more profound impact on my understanding of the destruction, horror, and sense of helplessness and despair in war.
B000UFAURI|4.0|As per ususal great - I am a long time fan and this met my expectations and beyond  - well worth buying.
0321544080|3.0|I like this book, I just don't love it.  Half the book is pretty pictures, the rest is cute stories about the picture with a sprinkling of how-to about the photos.  I learned a few tips, I guess I hoped to learn a lot.  Like someone else wrote, this isn't like having a Kelby photoshop book on photography. Too bad.

B000R7GKQE|5.0|This is my absolute favorite show, and if you have never seen it, you should. Sam & Dean are brothers who go across this country to fight demons, ghouls, monsters, and spirits. A yellow-eyed demon killed their Mom when Sam was 6 months old and Dean was 5 yr.s old. They kind of taken over the family business since their Dad gave his life for Dean's.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I would love to give a long review but I won't. I'm pretty sure there isn't anything new I could I add, that hasn't been said already. I just want to say that this is the first movie that truly moved me. First, I am a HUGE Beatles fan, so this movie is a dream come true to me. The music was great, and the plot tied into the songs was just genius. This is the first movie I was able to sing a long to. If you are a Beatles fan, I highly recommend you watch this!
B000PC8AFU|5.0|Hi,   If you are reading this review, then you must be a true SRV follower as I am.This CD is Stevie jammin' with other blues cats at different stages in his cut short music career. Highlights are Pipeline & Lets Dance.I bet you  wouldn't  have brought a Bowie record for this one song that put Stevie on the world stage, but now you can have it.  The live tracks capture Stevie on equal footing with his pears sometimes even holding back so as not to overpower then with his mighty guitar prowess.  Hopefully the SRV Estate will be able to also come up with a DVD of like material for us to remember him by also.
B000O1799U|2.0|So I decided since eveything was in such a hype of dreamgirls I would watch it.  Bad idea. Has anyone ever seen movies like Cabaret or hell even Sound of Music?  That is how you do a musical, not some horrible cheesefest of actors. I don't know about anyone else, but I am really tired of Jamie Foxx and his horrible attitude towards almost anything. By the time this movie started to get an interesting plot it was almost over, and the music wasn't even that catchy at all.  It was annoying after awhile, actually. I enjoyed this movie when they weren't singing, but it was just painful when they were.  Also it was extremely perdictable. I knew what was going to happen before it did, which makes it boring to watch.   The only reason it is getting any stars at all is because of Eddie Murphy and when they weren't singing.
0765350386|4.0|As soon as I heard that Mr. Sanderson would be writing the final WoT book, I knew I had to read his prior books.  I started with Warbreaker, as it is a free download on his website (and I own a Kindle and only use that for my reading now).  That book by the way is great!  I was disappointed than none of his other books are yet available in electronic format.<br /><br />When Tor released Mistborn as an ebook as part of their promotion I jumped on it.  I've gotta say that I couldn't put this book down!  It is extremely well written, and not your run-of-the-mill, cookie cutter fantasy novel.  It was unique in its magic system (allomancy), and in its characters (gotta love Kelsier). If you are a fan of the genre, this is a must read.<br /><br />I would have jumped right into the next book in the series but unfortunately it is not yet available in ebook, so I'll have to wait.
0307387178|4.0|great story, well written. holds your interest until the end. author forfeited his chance to get a 5 star review from because he put himself in it at the end.
B000SM7QUC|4.0|If your a Nikki Sixx fan then just get this already. Always takes too long to hear something new from someone in the band and this is worth the wait. I'll always prefer the Crue, but it's always good to hear new stuff from anyone in the band. Great album!
0452289963|5.0|This book is a must read for everyone no matter gender or age. It really gives you the insight you need to understand your purpose in life and to disentangle yourself from your ego.
0743454537|2.0|I recieved this book as part of a book-exchange group, and I wasn't thrilled as I did not particularly enjoy the other Picoult book I had read.  This one was no different.  Although Picoult's writing style is intriguing and I enjoy her non-chronological inclusion of flashbacks, this book was written entirely around the ending.  It played on sympathies to make the ending seem shocking and \\"unpredictable,\\" when it is completely obvious that the characters must experience some chaotic and tramautic event as a capstone to this event in their lives.  It is also difficult for us to develop sympathy for the mother; she obviously does see her younger daughter as a savior for her older, and we readers can hardly blame the younger for not especially liking that position.  In addition, the pyromaniac son seems to exist simply as a counterpart to his ever-so-perfect sick sister and to prove how distracted his parents, particularly his fireman father, have become.   I personally won't be picking up a Picoult book again; I prefer books that do not assume such naivete on behalf of the reader.
0452289963|5.0|This book is not for the casual reader.  I found the first chapter difficult to grasp at first, but stayed with it and began to open up to the message contained in this book.  I found it best to read this book in a quiet place with no distractions so I could fully absorb the words and meaning behind the words.  It is not a book you fly through, but I am glad I bought it.  I am also following the webcast on Oprah.com which is helping to understand the content even more.

0810993139|5.0|If you are trying to get your child interested in reading, this is a great book for BOYS AND GIRLS.      We first saw this book in the airport.  A little boy of about 6 was reading it and would not put it down.  He was totally engrossed.  His parents started talking about the illustrations and the writing inside.  We decided we should let our daughter read the book.  Our DAUGHTER picked up the book and read it in a week.  We would ask her if she understood it and she would tell us what was happening in detail.  There were many times where she would giggle out loud and ENJOY the book.  We just ordered the second one for her and she cannot wait to sit down to read it.      It's wonderful to see my 6 year old sit down and read a book and really enjoy the content because she wants to and not because she has to for school homework.  Excellent!
B00001ZWTT|1.0|I watched the TV series as a kid and loved it and was hoping for a hit with this film, but when I heard that Will Smith was being \\"miscast\\" as the secret service agent James West, I thought the wagon wheels have already come off this ride and I was right.  Will Smith was riding a popularity high at the time and this movie was rewritten abysmally for him.  The reality - at that period in our history, a black man would never have been able to move in the circles that they want you to believe he could especially among Southerners or those with allegiance to the \\"Cause\\". Kevin Kline is a passable Artie Gordon, Salma Hayek is a waste cavorting scantily clad while spouting cartoonish lines like: \\"Huhhh, oh he is so brave\\",  and converting the evil genius of Dr Loveless into a Confederate Racist amputee was just plain silly.  Except for the sophomoric exchange between West and Loveless where they spew racist epitaphs at each other this movie is a write off.  The producers didn't know what they wanted to make here -- a drama, a comedy or bordering on a campy romp.  So rent this if you really really really want to hear the jokey epitaph exchange but only if it's 99 cents or less.  Instead, spend your hard earn dollars for DVDs of the original series -- even though they were produced in the 60s with less money and without CGI special effects the series is far superior to this pile of horse manure!
B000088E6M|4.0|Yeah it's true that this was the most overrated release of 2003. But it's also true that this was the best album that he has ever made(next to Guess Who's Back). Every wack album after this proves it. In Da Club was a huge record for him and Many Men, Wanksta, What Up Gangsta pretty much kept this album afloat. Eminem makes two dominating appearances on here(Patiently Waiting and Dont Push Me). Eminem floored 50 on Patiently Waiting and Both Em and Lloyd Banks leave 50 in the dust in Dont Push Me. Back Down while overrated was a good diss record towards Ja Rule and Murda Inc but they could have kept Alex Thomas fruit basket a** off of the record though. Gotta Make It Heaven is tight as well as the three bonus tracks: Wanksta, U Not Like Me and Life's On The Line. Contrary to popular belief this album is not a classic. Blood Hound feat Young Buck is weak. Like My Style feat Tony Yayo is straight garbage and Poor Lil Rich, P.I.M.P., and 21 Question feat Nate Dogg have filler written all over them. By the way, the bonus DVD is not worth mentioning. Other than that, this album was good but way overhyped. Even though GRODT is overrated in comparison to what came after it, GRODT is one of the few G-unit releases worth mentioning. Standouts: WHAT UP GANGSTA, PATIENTLY WAITING, MANY MEN(WISH DEATH), IN DA CLUB, HEAT, IF I CANT, BACK DOWN, DONT PUSH ME, GOTTA MAKE IT TO HEAVEN, U NOT LIKE ME and LIFE'S ON THE LINE.
B000MRAAJW|4.0|This is the most spectacular documentary that I have ever seen.  The photography is superb and includes closeups and scenes that I would consider impossible to get if I hadn't seen them with my own eyes.  The narration was also excellent......not too much was said and it let your eyes paint the picture.  My only complaint with the album is quality control on one of the discs which did not provide sound for about 15 minutes of the presentation.      I think that this album should be a staple of everybody's DVD library.
0452289963|4.0|You need to read this book a couple of times. It is worth reading. I don't agree with all of it but it's message is valuable and it has shown me how to be in this world.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|This album was the first Sufjan I heard and it bored me. I had not yet perfected my present taste in tunes and his untraditional style totally threw me off.  Later however I began to recognize his artistic qualities that point out real musicians.Sufjan's use of a huge assortment of instuments adds to his artsy flavor. He is a quality musician. One thing Sufjan could profit from is some good hip funk, no matter how beautiful the album is it could do with some fun. Sufjan is definitely capable of this and has shown it in his remix \\"the avalanche\\" in numbers like \\"Henny buggy band\\" and \\"the perpetual self, or what would Saul Alinsky do?\\". Of course, if your a real Sufjan fan then this won't matter to you, and in that case Illinoise is a must.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|If you are a Stargate SG1 fan you will definately want to purchase this movie. I have been a fan since the beginning with the original Stargate with Kurt Russel. I usually have found spin offs lacking from original releases but I just fell in love with this series and how the charactors all interact and bring out the best in each others charactors. I won't analyse this release with other than the special effects are fantastic and the story line finishes where the series left off. One mention however is in one of the last scenes I have to say Amanda Tapping is just gorgeous with her hair down. Hope everyone enjoys this release as much as I did.
0452289963|5.0|This is a very well written, inspirational kind of book.  As the author notes, those who are open to the messages contained within will be those who really resonate to what's being said.    For myself, I was glad that I didn't fall into the trap of constantly making comparisons with another spiritual \\"guru\\" I'm rather fond of.  That kind of mental game would only detract from my ability to resonate as well as I did.  About the only item I'd take issue with is his prescribed \\"hand exercise\\" which I bring up having at one time practiced Tai Chi for a few years; in my experience at the time, it had no effect in changing my body consciousness(and certainly not in helping my immune system!).

B000KKPN5C|5.0|[[ASIN:B000KKPN5C Nikon SB-400 AF Speedlight for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras]]   I at first hesitated to buy it because the cost was so reasonable (for Nikon), and i didn't think it would do the job.  But it ads so much to my indoor photos, especially with the ability to \\"bounce\\"  the flash off the ceiling. It is lightweight, fast, I can rapid shoot with it, and not wait for it to get ready. Because it is small I take it with me and get alot more indoor shots when visiting relatives.
B0012K1ILW|4.0|Erykah Badu serves up a cocktail of 70s funky soul, hip-hop and jazz over which she sings her songs of truth - songs that some might find challenging. It's a slight change of direction for Badu in the sense that there is a more edgy, political style to her lyrics on this one. She reminds me in places of the group Undisputed Truth who were pretty radical back in the day.<br /><br />I've always had love for the lady. Her 1997 debut [[ASIN:B000005AYM Baduizm]] was an almost orgasmic blend of solid hip-hop beats and deep modern soul vibes  but she has since steadfastly refused to return to the formula that gave her huge commercial success and essentially put her indelible mark on the musical map. I was saying to someone just recently, that I have the utmost respect for any artiste who does what she wants to do, as opposed to what everyone else is doing or what might make good radio, good sales or whatever. More people should be like her. I'll take authentic over popular any day as long as I like how it sounds, no matter how \\"wierd\\" or \\"strange\\" the masses might think it is.<br /><br />Well, she's definitely doing what she wants to do on this one. Artistically, I think it's courageous, authentic and admirable. Commercially though, while I'm pretty sure no one knows it more than the lady herself, I think it's a bit of a gamble. But what do I know? The album entered the Billboard Top 200 at a very respectable #2 and currently stands at #6. She's in at #2 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart (but for Janet's [[ASIN:B00112ARJ0 Discipline]], she probably would have entered at #1) so right now, the gamble seems to be paying off. (Whatever favour she might find in the charts here in the UK will not be evident until tomorrow).<br /><br />Among my personal favourites are the blaxploitation era-styled opener, \\"Amerykahn Promise\\", produced by Roy Ayers, Edwin Birdsong &<br />William Allen and featuring vocals by Ramp; the message-laden \\"The Healer\\", produced by Madlib; the very personal mid-tempo shuffler \\"Me\\", produced by Badu & Shafiq Husayn and featuring horns by Roy Hargrove; \\"Soldier\\", another song with a message, produced by Badu & Kariem Riggins and featuring guest vocals by Bilal; the utterly funky, bass-driven \\"The Cell\\" (another message!), again produced by Badu & Husayn; \\"Telephone\\", the beautiful ballad tribute to J Dilla (she also gave him a shout on \\"The Healer\\") produced by Badu, James Poyser and Ahmir '? Luv' Thompson and of course, the 9th Wonder-produced 'bonus track' (and lead single) \\"Honey\\" - though I have to admit; the song, when I first heard it on disc, did not have the same impact that it did when I first saw the video.<br /><br />One or two of the songs don't work for me at all; the first half of \\"Master Teacher\\" is a good example, though the jazzy second half of the song more than makes up for it. \\"That Hump\\" is another. It's just a bit too untidy for my liking. The song was born out of a jam session, apparently. It shows. The album as a whole takes time to appreciate but is well worth it once you get there.<br /><br />A wee bit of trivia: the songs on this album are not all the lengths stated on the CD back cover. \\"Amerykahn Promise\\", for instance, is 4mins 16secs long (and not the 3:40 noted); \\"Me\\" is 5mins 36secs long (not 4:24); \\"Soldier\\", 5mins 3secs (not 3:55); \\"The Cell\\", 4mins 20secs (not 3:36); \\"Twinkle\\", with its emotional but totally on-point tirade towards the end, 6mins 56secs (not 4:02) and \\"Master Teacher\\" is 6mins 47secs long (not 3:37). There may be other examples on here; I didn't have the time to check all 11 songs. It's probably an unimportant detail but I wonder what the deal is? Oversight or intentional error? Another message?

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this video..it was very \\"eye-opening\\" and really exposed the shame of our medical industry - the insurance companies, the drug companies, the lawyers, the HMO's, and on and on.  Plus it shattered myths about \\"socialized medicine\\" and shows how well it REALLY does work in countries around the world - even CUBA!!!  It is the shame of America!
B000GH3CVQ|5.0|The movie \\"Once\\" is really great, the music from it even better. Glen Hansard in particular has a very moving emotional voice, Marketa Irglova is amazing. I can't wait for them to come Keller in April.

B000FSME1A|4.0|I think the original version of Apocalypse Now is vastly superior to the needlessly long Redux, although the additional scenes of the latter (the French plantation, Playboy bunnies, Willard stealing the surfboard) are interesting in and of themselves. So now we can have both, in a single, bargain-priced and handsomely packaged edition. As with most DVDs, the bonus deleted scenes are pretty much a waste of time, although they do help a person understand the choices Coppola made in editing, and in that sense, it really drives home the magnitude of his achievement in creating the original masterpiece. I don't like that the movie is broken into two parts; why couldn't they have put the original on one disc, and Redux on the other? But then again, in a long movie most people have to take a bathroom break at some point anyway, and the sampan massacre is an appropriately dramatic scene with which to end part one. All told, The Apocalypse Now Complete Dossier 2-disc special edition is well worth buying.

0312379293|4.0|Danny Cartwright proposes to his beloved Beth Wilson who accepts.  The pair and her brother Bernie, who is also his best friend, celebrate.  Four drunks (Spencer Craig, Lawrence Davenport, Gerald Payne, and Toby Mortimer), who call themselves the Musketeers insult the trio.  A fight occurs and one of the quartet stabs Bernie killing him.  The four Musketeers swear they witnessed Danny kill the man though he claims otherwise.  Since they are elite Cambridge University graduates and successful professionals who speak and dress like aristocratic gentlemen while he is an illiterate slum scum, he is charged with the homicide as \\"clothing\\" makes the man.  His attorney the best one he can obtain with little money is slaughtered by the prosecutor.  Danny is convicted to serve twenty-two years at maximum-security Belmarsh Prison.<br /><br />In prison Danny shares a cell with Nicholas Moncrieff, who teaches him to read Dumas. When someone kills Moncrieff, Danny pretends to be Nicholas and escapes his incarceration.  His goals are to destroy the Musketeers and prove his innocence.<br /><br />The fun in this crime thriller is finding the numerous references to The Count of Monte Cristo as Jeffrey Archer pays homage to Alexander Dumas.  The story line is fast-paced from the moment of the first confrontation and never slows down as Danny works his revenge.  Although the key players including the hero are never fully developed beyond their link to the original novel, readers will enjoy this entertaining modernization of the Dumas classic.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B00133KFGW|5.0|So many reviews have focused on the \\"Oliver Twist\\" subplot to this film and failed to see the genius in the true structure.  August Rush is a clever inversion of classic Anastasia tales, where it is the parents, not the wayward child, who need to be reminded of whom they were meant to be.  On a spiritual level, this film has kinship to the legends of the reincarnation of the Buddha and the Christian emphasis on the importance of children in being able to perceive the heavenly realms.  Little Evan-August is music incarnate who seeks not only to restore his wayward parents, but to harmonize a discordant creation.  And the film as well as it's protagonist succeed!
0452289963|5.0|Very few books will make you see yourself and the world around you different.  This book will.  With each chapter, each suptopic, I could feel something changing within me.  By the time I completed it, I was a more peaceful and happy person. I know the concepts or realities of the book will be lost on some or seem too new age or deep for others.  But for those who understand it and apply it, I am sure you will have the same result I had. No book I have read before has changed me so dramatically.  I would encourage anyone who either wants to become a better more alive person or a more spiritual person to read this book.
B000067J1H|5.0|This is an absolutely original movie, unlike anything else. Its a satire with a really grim sense of humor. Designed to encourage thought rather than to just entertain. The situations are just presented straightforwardly & the audience is left to make up its own mind. I'm grateful somebody's making intelligent films like this & we get a choice & an occasional change of pace. This is quite possibly the weirdest mainstream movie out there & extremely worth the viewer's trouble. The 3 leads are fantastic & they all do a top-notch job. I read the book after seeing the flick & I'm glad I did it in that order. The movie's plot twist wasn't ruined for me beforehand & I got a better understanding from the book. For example, in the book its explained that Tyler Durden gets all his clothes from the lost-and-found at bus stations & so forth. So you see why he dresses so strangely.  Again, only try this one if you're looking for something unusual.
B0013KTGAG|1.0|Started out good but quickly degraded to a 3rd rate horror movie - evil undead captain killing people with souped up butter knives. Saw this movie with smart thoughtful people who all agreed - no deep meaning here other than NEVER go onto the ghost ship and avoid butter knives.
B000X5KSWM|5.0|First off i must say, stop judging this as if it were a Nightwish album. It's not, and it wont be. It is Tarja's style and it not as heavy. She is more operatic and thats just her style, quite similar to Sarah Brightman. Dont expect a wicked heavy fast hardcore album, again its not Nightwish. Some people have called the album boring, but I think its excellent and beautiful. It's a different style, it's very relaxing and pretty. Tarja's voice is good as ever. If it's not heavy enough for you, theres plenty of stuff that is in similar styles.. Within Temptation... Nightwish... Evanescence.. Tristania..   Peace and love.  Cody
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I pre-ordered this on 12/08/07 & Amazon shipped it to me ahead of the 3/11/08 release date so I had it early (USA).     I own all 10 seasons of SG-1, the original movie, SGA Rising, SG AoT, and plan to purchase Continuum. I will continue to buy all DVD offerings from SG-1 & SGA. There are not many shows I watch but SG-1, SGA, BSG, Firefly, X Files, & Terminator SCC are the type of shows I am interested in with SG-1 & SGA my favorites.    I have only watched AoT once (and the extra features) but the imagery and on location scenery including sets are wonderful. Character interaction, trademark humor, and pace of the episode/movie are great. Great action sequences and FX. When I watch it again I am sure I will enjoy it as much or more.     Any show or movie will have some flaws but overall Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis have been thoroughly fantastic for me and I dread the eventuality of NO new shows or movies from SG. In this current time, how else will I be able to travel off world to explore new planets?
B000ZLFALS|3.0|I had to return my Blu-ray Across the Universe, because I don't have the equipment for viewing Blu-ray! So if you're out of sync with the latest technology, take my warning and always read the full product descriptions before buying. That'll save yourself the hassle of having to return stuff and the disappointment of not having ordered the right thing in the first place.  The good news, though: Across the Universe is a fabulous movie! I highly recommend it as a great portrayal of the late 1960s with fantastic music, reinterpreted Beatles music for today.
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made, and it looks spectacular in 1080p.<br /><br />It is perfect in every way, and always leaves me with that warm fuzzy feeling inside after watching it.<br /><br />I love how the movie looks, the photography, the feel of it.  The colors and hues in the film are breathtaking.<br /><br />Everyone should be required to watch this, because sadly, this is where our society is headed, and this movie presents it beautifully.<br /><br />It may be my favorite movie.  In fact, it must be.  And yes as other reviewers say, the quality of the Blu Ray transfer is impeccable.  Absolutely stunning.<br /><br />Required watching/renting/buy.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|It is an outstanding CD.  I have seen one play this year and Wicked was it.  One of the most outstanding performances I have ever seen.  The music is outstanding and on this CD, it was performed to perfection.  I recommend this CD without any reservation.
B00003CXC7|5.0|There are solid reasons why this is justifiably considered one of the greatest movies of all time.<br /><br />The plot is intelligent, the characters well-developed, the actors top notch, Princess Grace is incredibly glamorous, the dialog is memorable and the social observations and commentary quite thought-provoking.  It's a visual and verbal treat at every level.<br /><br />I do agree that the murder is not so much the main point of the movie (since we never actually see the murder and there's no doubt as to whodunit), as is the exercise in pseudo-voyeurism that Hitchcock provides.  The viewer gets to take advantage of the neighborhood espionage of L.B. Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart).  It should be pointed out that in 1954, television had fortunately not yet become the staple feature of American home life - which makes it understandable that a homebound individual in an urban neighborhood would unintentionally find himself watching real people instead.<br /><br />If you're looking for mindless, action-filled entertainment full of gratuitous sex, gadgetry and/or special effects, then it is true that you will probably not enjoy this movie.  But that will be your loss.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Very good - loved the use of the Beatle's tunes and enjoyed the overall move.
B000E5N62U|3.0|I own about everything Steely Dan has done. I rarely play this CD. I might play the H Gang, but this is a big miss by a great artist. I can't put Donald down. He is amazing, but I don't play this much at all.   Sorry Steely,   It's a miss. Nice audio if you like CD's. I don't. I play vinyl and based on what I heard, I just won't pony up the money to buy it on vinyl.
0596007124|5.0|First off, this book is not for all programmers.  If you think the Gang of Four (GoF) books were great: stay way.  If you think the Gof book are not readable: get this book.    It was written by unconventional writers who are actually trying to TEACH the subject, rather than just tell you about it.  That is different from almost all other tech books I see these days.    If you are new to design patterns, but know your object oriented design, this book could be for you.  But please, go check out the book at a bookstore first.
0451450523|5.0|If you liked the movie, you will almost certainly like the book. There is a lot of narrative in here that is word for word with the film (probably because Peter Beagle did the screenplay for it), but you do get a bit more to the story. For example, you miss out on the whole prince Lir subplot in the film.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|No exaggeration.   Music is absolutely great. Each and every cut is a different style.  ....and the big surprise ?   The lyrics - smart, funny and tends to bring you back - hear this CD again and again.

B00003CX9E|5.0|Lots of people would use lots of different criteria for themselves in deciding what makes a movie great; I know people who dismiss any movie that's in black and white for instance.  Others need non-stop action with fancy special effects and crystal clear colour enhanced with CGI if necessary before they would even consider the content as a candidate for greatness.  For me, a movie has to have substance and it has to move me with an abiding message that never gets old even with repeated viewing.<br /><br />Like another reviewer, I agree that what makes this movie for me other than the innovative manner of telling a story using flashbacks and excellent acting and directing is the message that the movie is trying to put across and \\"Citizen Kane\\" does this extremely well indeed.  For me this movie proves that our actions and what we eventually become are inextricably linked to how we treat one another and how we in turn are treated.  We see young Kane as a relatively well-balanced kid who is suddenly traumatised with a shocking dislocation from his familiar and loving family background to embark upon a life not of his own choosing.  Charles Foster Kane becomes what he becomes as a consequence of this probably feeling that a lack of parental love and a lack of control over his life is what led to his involuntary departure from his \\"Eden\\" subsequently over compensates and results in his self-destructive and generally despised future behaviour.  I found myself greatly sympathising with Welles' character and it helped me understand my own life too.  This movie touched me deeply and the great acting, directing etc was a nice plus too.<br /><br />This 2-disc version is a real treat for fans as well as the picture quality is brilliantly restored; the only thing I would have liked to have is an option for Dolby Digital Surround 5.1 or DTS with THX quality sound.  They were able to do it with \\"Gone With the Wind\\", \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" etc and so they really should be able to go all out for this of all films.  The documentary \\"The Battle for Citizen Kane\\" is also very good and is a big plus for the overall package.<br /><br />Overall, this comes highly recommended although I hope they would improve the sound quality options should a Blu-Ray version be in the works.f all films.

B0006A9FKA|4.0|this is a good movie but  dont expect it to be as good as hot fuzz
B00003CX9W|5.0|This movie was clearly way ahead of its time when it was released in the early 1940s and I'm not surprised that it was a box-office flop at that time as it struck me while watching this that this must be the \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" of animation at that time.  Another major reason for the lack of success was that the logistics of the times were not up to scratch as few theatres were equiped with stereophonic sound and probably fewer audiences still were able to stand what amounts to more than 2 hours of a collection of music videos and yet it's unmistakeable that this is simply a work of art and this movie alone convinced me that Walt Disney was a genius.<br /><br />Some of the scenes were like Mickey on an acid trip and this movie was clearly targeted at an adult audience more so than say a \\"Snow White\\" was clearly targeted at kids.  I thoroughly enjoyed these classical music MTVs except for Bach's \\"Toccata and Fugue In D Minor\\" which was arranged for orchestra by Stokowski instead of in the original solo pipe organ arrangement which would have been better and the \\"Meet the Soundtrack\\" segment both of which should have been left off and would not have been missed.<br /><br />The rest of the videos though were excellent and I found myself better appreciating the original compositions when listened together with the brilliant animation that although is almost 70 years old now still looks very impressive to me although I'm sure the brilliant digital restoration had a large part to play in it as well.  My favourite was the Beethoven 6th Symphony video with Stravinsky's \\"Rite of Spring\\" coming in a close second.  Tchaikovsky's \\"Nutcracker Suite\\" video was charming too and Ponchielli's \\"Dance of the Hours\\" was just hilarious!  The \\"Night On Bald Mountain\\" video was chilling and would give any death metal video ala the band Death a good run for its money in terms of scare value too.<br /><br />What I really liked the best about this DVD though is the brilliant sound quality with Dolby Digital, DTS Surround Sound in 5.0 channels with THX quality which makes it better for me to listen to the classical music tracks off the DVD than off my cds on my high end stereo!  The picture quality has been restored very well too and so the minor imperfections were few and far between and you really had to look real hard to find them.<br /><br />The special features were a real treat too with the featurette \\"The Making of Fantasia\\" the standout item there.

B000025H0Q|4.0|History is not so much doomed to repeat itself as it is to revise itself.     Clearly Bryter Layter has been an important touchstone for the indie-folk and chamber-pop set, and it is a glimpse at Drake out from under his usual spare, melancholy mantle.  There are some positively bubbly arrangements that belie the myth of Drake the introverted suicidal.  Flutes, strings, and percolating piano lines adorn songs that, in a more \\"Pink Moon\\" mood, might have garnered tags like \\"somber\\" or \\"interior.\\"    For fans of Drake who appreciate his fingerpicked guitar and wistful, reflective material, Bryter Layter is often the least favorite -- \\"Poor Boy\\" and \\"Hazy Jane II\\" don't fit the mold of Drake as lonely outsider.  Clearly some daring was shown in producing this album -- Drake even insisted he had \\"no songs left\\" when Bryter Layter's three instrumentals were in jeopardy of being left off the album.  He was proud of the arrangements and the lusher sound.    He rethought this approach by the time he recorded Pink Moon, an album without so much as a vocal harmony.    It is really difficult to listen to Nick Drake dispassionately, forgetting he was an overlooked genius in his own time, forgetting his recorded output is entirely crystallized by his early death and by critical adoration.  He is destined to be forever brilliant, forever charmed, forever sad and haunting.  Idiosyncratic albums like Bryter Layter might be seen as stylistic blips leading to his \\"true\\" sound on Pink Moon -- just an idealistic dalliance with adding lush orchestrations to his simple and emotionally gripping songs.    Now that Drake is cannonized by Volkswagen commercials and a younger generation \\"discovering\\" and \\"revering\\" him, all his albums are considered brilliant.  If a demo is unearthed, it is given huge amounts of attentive listening.  If only living artists had this privilege!    In that light, and perhaps in a deliberate effort to find fault with Bryter Layter and the general adulation givenDrake, I could complain that the orchestral arrangements veer close to what would become smooth jazz, that the breezy horns and flutes are at odds with the outlook of the songs.  I'm not ready to fully adore this album the way \\"Five Leaves Left\\" and \\"Pink Moon\\" salve my ears and listen like clear, sparse poetry.  Indeed the album was met somewhat coolly upon its release.  Yet the strength of Nick Drake's songwriting shines through the experimentation with swelling strings and jazzy rhythm guitars.  The search for pop is in high evidence here.      This was a necessary misadventure for Drake, still standing on its own feet and earning its own four stars by merit alone.  The most dated of Drake's recordings, but far far from inessential.  Some sobriety is needed in the reviews -- not all new listeners will listen charitably (at least not at first).  Bryter Layter is probably the most pleasant sounding \\"challenging\\" music out there.  If misteps were made, at least they were made with confidence, and led to further artistic growth.
B000077VR3|1.0|The entire time I watched this movie I was absolutely miserable. Kidman's voice ruined classic songs (for me at least) and it was just way too eccentric for me, which is funny because I liked Across the Universe and that's very eccentric as well . . . It seemed to just try to have shock value more than anything else. It was a very plot driven movie with not much character work. I can understand that some people like this but I really couldn't stand it. If I could give it zero stars I would. All flash and no substance.

B0010358D0|4.0|Not as original as the...errr...original, but still a really good sequel.      It takes a lot of elements from other modern stories, you get zombies (sort of), the Matrix (sort of), and one of the primary vehicles of the story, Connexus, is ripped right out of another story, but the plot is very good, the visuals are impressive.  You can see John Woo's influence, but it isn't over the top.  I like the love triangle idea and it works well, up until the last lines of the movie (Way too convenient and forced).    One change that didn't completely click with me is the change to rendering.  The characters are still cell shaded and 3D rendered, but it looks like they tried to 'smooth' the differences between characters and the scenery, but I liked the stronger contrast in the original.  Also, the motion capture seemed weak in places.    Definitely worth a purchase.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|This isn't going to be a very sophisticated review; nor is it necessarily objective. I loved the CD mostly because I really enjoy her voice; I find it nice and mellow and fun to listen to in the car. I heard her first on the Napster commercial and decided I had to have her CD, pure and simple. Little known artists need all the help they can get in the form of CD sales, so any type of illegal download is out of the question. I think America has to vote with their wallets in this type of situation.     And yes, I do believe others will enjoy her music as well, although I understand this style is not for everyone. So, if you liked her sound-bite on the commercial, you won't be disappointed by buying the full version.

America's warriors, since the invasion of Afghanistan, have amazed those who have taken time to learn of the dynamics of the invasion and ongoing struggle against the Taliban. Their moral orientation, their combat capability, their toughness, and their compassion for all living things may seem diametrically opposed. Not so. Americans have every right to have pride in the Navy Seal organization. When a dirty job comes up on the radar screen, the Navy Seals are quick to respond and complete difficult jobs anywhere on the planet.
6305754969|5.0|Some say that Howard Hawks made the same picture three times with Rio Bravo, El Dorado, and Rio Lobo.  In the broad strokes, it is true.  John Wayne isn't the straight romantic lead in any of them, but has his interests.  There are several beautiful young women in different roles in the film and there is a younger man, usually a male star that someone is trying to push (Ricky Nelson, James Caan, and Jorge Rivero).  And Wayne is fighting some mysterious guy with all the money trying to cheat and drive out an honest family.  All the stories have enough twists to be enjoyable.  And I liked this story very much.<br /><br />In this movie John Wayne plays a hired gun named Cole Thornton.  He comes into El Dorado and meets up with Sheriff JP Harrah (Robert Mitchum).  The have known each other since before the Civil War, but something has passed between them.  They respect each other, but aren't quite close friends.  One of the problems is Maudie (the beautiful and captivating Charlene Holt).  She has a relationship with the Sheriff, but she has deep affection for Cole, and that spoils it for Harrah.<br /><br />The Sheriff is worried that Cole has gone over to a bad place and wants to fill him in on the truth about Bart Jason (Ed Asner) who has hired Cole.  The truth is that Jason has been building a big spread that requires more water, but the water he needs is on land owned by the MacDonald family.  The MacDonalds have been on their land and built their ranch over a lifetime and after much sacrifice and hard work.  They don't want to sell.  Cole is supposed to convince them to sell.  Cole decides he doesn't want to work for Jason and heads over to his place to return the money he was paid - less traveling expenses.  The MacDonalds have heard about Cole and left one of their sons as a watchman.  A tragedy occurs and the boy's sister ends up shooting Cole with a wound that leaves a bullet pressing against his spine.  Every now and again, it causes Cole shooting pain and temporary paralysis that increases with time.<br /><br />Cole leaves the town and along the way picks up Alan Bourdillion Traherne (James Caan) as a traveling companion.  Traherne is called Mississippi by Cole because he finds the name as absurd as the man's hat.<br /><br />There are people on both sides of the fight over the MacDonald's land, but by the time Cole returns to El Dorado, Harrah is a sorry drunk.  The story builds to a climax with Cole, Harrah, Bull Harris, and (Arthur Hunnicutt) under siege in the town jail.  Christopher George does a nice turn as Nelse McLeod, the gun hired by Jason to counter Cole's support of Harrah.<br /><br />I will let you watch the movie to see the way things work out.  Sure, you can guess the final resolution, but the way the story twists and turns does keep us entertained.  One of the lighter moments comes when Harrah sobers up and his companions demand that he bather.  I will let you delight in the way the scene plays out.<br /><br />Quite a good Waynestern.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MIysis that increases with time.

There are detailed instructions and clear photos for many techniques of bead making that I have not seen in other books. Although the gallery of works is fairly small, each instruction page contains finished projects that are fine examples of the craft.     This is probably not a true beginners book, but anyone who owns other polymer clay books should have enough basic skills to enjoy this book and be able to accomplish the interesting projects shown here.

B000TKW3E2|5.0|When I first heard about the movie, and knowing I LOVE soundtracks, I thought I'd give it a try!  Its so worth it, even to listen to samples, with its mesmerizing type writing, piano and deep strings.  My favorite songs are:  1. Elegy for Dunkirk (gotta love the men's choir background)  2. The Half-Killed  3. Rescue Me  4. Denouement (sorry if its mispelled...0  5. Atonement (best piece of music I've ever heard!  This is the star!)    Though I haven't read the book or seen the movie, I know about the story and its sad! I'm sure its worth seeing, from what I've seen in previews, but I think I'll wait until it comes on TV or find it edited somehow.  But before you see it, I think getting into the music will help you appreciate the movie even more!  Its the best soundtrack you'll ever buy!
0974872407|3.0|The book is very good in conveying the sad and dark environment of post Civil War Spain and, if you have ever been to Barcelona, you feel it has been able to capture the spirit of the city. It is enjoyable and always keeps the reader interested, but in many aspects it remains a promise without achieving the expectations it arises during the first chapters. The plot, though in a restraint way, borders the soap opera and characters lose psycolgical depth and tend more to stereotypes as the book progresses through a chain of unlikely coincidences in the plot. In short,you will never get bored but, in spite of the impression you might get while enjoying the first pages, do not expect much more than decent enterntainment.

0385338724|2.0|I am a HUGE Shopaholic fan. Huge. I even forgave the Shopaholic & Sister book.  Something about Becky Bloomwood made me want to read each of the stories and read them all in one day (book, not the series, lol).  Anyway, I also adored Can You Keep a Secret.  Becky and Emma were neurotic and occasionally over the top in their actions, but they cracked me up and I always wanted to see what would happen next.      This book, and the other one Undomestic Goddess are severely pale in comparison to the aforementioned.  The two heroines seem like empty shells devoid of any of the charm of Becky and Emmma.  Remember Me? was a hard one to read.  I was so excited to read it, and even pre-ordered it, but it was a chore to finish. Matter of fact, just tonight, I started skimming pages until I made it to the end.  I'm not going to rehash the synopsis.  The characters felt so on the surface. One-dimensional.  Couldn't find a reason to empathize with any of them, even our heroine amnesiac.  It was just awful.

B00005JPTK|2.0|Sigh... I had high hopes for this film that were ultimately laid low. Will Smith is great as Neville, but why did they mix up a few different scripts, including using ideas from The Omega Man (which is still my favorite adaptation) rather than SIMPLY USE THE BOOK. I Am Legend is the greatest Vampire Novel ever written. It should be done, one day, as the book, not a conglomeration of ideas from other films. As many have said, the first half of the film is great. Smith alone with his dog (which doesn't happen in the book, but when Neville does find the dog it's the books strongest point), traveling through a devestated New York (and done very well). Where the movie fails though is in a few major points: 1 - Making the infected non-characters. In the book they are your neighbors and friends, not simple, doofus, monsters of the week. 2 - Removing his wife and child in a helicopter crash, rather than having them be infected.<br />3 - The rather smarmy ending, which feels tacked on (even though Neville does have to die). The film is good, but far from perfect. Perhaps one day someone will have the guts to do it as the book, and not just pander to a star and the idea of simply making money.

It is fine for what it is, but it is not what is in the item description.  It is DTS encoded CD, not DVD.  It will play on any DVD player that supports DTS or that has a optical output to a \\"receiver that can decode DTS.  It does not need a DVD-Audio player at all.      \\"The crucial difference is that DVD-Audio uses a lossless compression scheme while DTS uses a lossy compression scheme. This means that data will be lost when DTS is decoded while DVD-Audio will preserve the original data structure.  In practice DTS can be found in 4 sound qualities, most using 20bit/48kHz (a qualified guess):    754 kb/s: Used on DVD.  ca 1200 kb/s: Used on DTS CD.  1509 kb/s: Used on DVD  24bit/96khz, unknown bitrate.  In comparison, full DVD-Audio in 6 channels use a bit rate of 13824 kb/s.

For $2 more you would have the DVD-Audio disc which would have the DD tracks as well.      From the net:    \\"However, the DVD-A sounds seriously better than the DTS disc, plus it has a great hi-rez stereo track to boot! Get the DVD-A!\\"  \\"the 2004 release is a regular DVD-Audio disc. In addition to the high-res DVD-A tracks, it does contain a 5.1 DD track playable on any DVD player.    \\"You are correct that it does not have a DTS track. However, I would still recommend you get the DVD-A (2004) version. You can play it in multichannel, and when you upgrade to a DVD-A compatible player you will have access to the high-res tracks. With the older DTS disc you're stuck with the lower-res DTS mix.\\"  \\"So to summarize what has been said, DTS-CD cannot be listened to in stereo. The DTS-CD isnot as good of a mix as the DVD-A, plus you may listen in stereo if you wish.\\"

B000JJRIP2|3.0|This box set is great because it contains recently remastered material. Well, at least I hope that is a good thing because I don't have the original CD's to compare it to.    This box set has a lot of duplicate tracks. Seventeen to be exact. There are four different versions of Rocka and Roll All Nite. The bad thing about this is the the value of the box set is diminished. The good thing about this is that you get to choose which version of the song you like best.    I would hate to get stuck with the versions from the Millennium Concert because they are slow and lifeless. I only kept three out of the fifteen songs, and only because they weren't duplicates.    Then there is my favorite Alive, ALIVE III. The duplicate songs on this album are much better than those of the previous two. Extra effects are added and it sounds a lot bolder and cleaner.    And then exist the other two albums which are also great, although they don't sound as good as III.    Overall, this is a good compilation of KISS. It doesn't have every hit that I'd like, but I'm satisfied with the purchase.

Miller's Crossing tells the tale of a mob boss, Leo, his partner, and the many, many, many things that trouble them.

B000V8I2QU|2.0|I have been a Bruce Springsteen fan for more than 20 years and own most of his music. I saw him in 1985 during the Born in the USA tour and consider that show to be the best live concert I've ever attended.     I pre-ordered Magic based on comments by Springsteen's manager that this album echoed the Boss's work of the 1970's. Having listened through the album several times, I do not agree with that assessment. I agree with many others that some of the lyrics are hard to understand. For a person like Springsteen who has something to say about life in our times, I think the words matter. Many of the songs aim for the good-time feel of some of Springsteen's earlier work with the obligatory Clarence Clemon's solos and fine keyboard work by  Roy Bittan, but they don't have much to say.     The highlights for me are the buoyant \\"Livin' in the Future\\" and the wry cover song \\"Magic,\\" both subtle damnations of the policies of the \\"Current Occupant.\\" I admire Springsteen for putting his reputation and career on the line to say what needs to be said in this day and age of people who will crucify you for speaking against those currently in power. But he should have made sure the final mix of the songs put those words out front.     I wanted to like this album. Despite repeated listens, I can't get very excited about it as a whole,  although I do really like a couple of the songs.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|This CD is good.  By now, everyone knows about the crazy media ruckus that surrounded the release of My December.  Being a huge fan of Breakaway (Since U Been Gone is in my top 3 favorite songs of all time), I can't deny that I was more than a little worried.  However, Kelly didn't disappoint and My December just as strong song for song as Breakaway, despite the massive hits.  I definitely recommend buying the entire album, but for those who are just looking for specific tracks to download on iTunes, here's a quick rundown.    The Standouts:  One Minute: A frothy concoction of electro-pop that makes me want to jump when I hear it.  If you like a New Wave-ish techno beat, this track is for you.      Hole: One of my early favorites from the album.  It's much more edgy than anything Kelly's done before, with a fiercely catchy guitar loop and addictive chorus.      Sober: Probably the best song Kelly's ever recorded and my hands down favorite from My December.  Amazon's clip doesn't do it justice. The song is a slow, hypnotic build to an absolutely arresting vocal performance by Kelly at the end.  If you buy only one track, this is definitely the one.    Maybe: I have loved this song ever since I heard Kelly sing it on tour.  It's another slow burning track that builds steadily over crunchy guitars as the song progresses. The key here is the lyrics, which are amazing and utterly personal.    How I Feel: No Doubt meets Cyndi Lauper, with vocals by Kelly.  Seriously, this song is unbelievably catchy, both lyrically and musically.  It had the potential to be a huge hit, so it's a shame it wasn't released.    Irvine/Chivas:  An absolute masterpiece. Irvine is about as personal and raw as it gets, to the point where it's sometimes tough to listen to.  It's beautifully crafted though and comes with a huge payoff: Chivas.  Chivas is the hidden track which starts about a minute after Irvine ends.  It's a hilarious kiss-off to a bad lover that's infinitely singable.  I would have bought the CD for this song alone.    Honorable Mention:  Dirty Little Secret: This isn't on the CD; it's only available as a bonus track on iTunes.  However, it's completely awesome and one of my favorite Kelly songs of all time.  Kelly sounds--dare I say it--lusty when singing, with a seductive purr on the verses and an all out wail on the chorus. This song really does rival SUBG in its infectiousness.     Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend any fans of Kelly's previous work or just casual music lovers in general.  It may lack some of Breakaway's polish, but it's an important step in the evolution of Kelly as an artist and one of the best albums of 2007.

0374105235|3.0|It is important to bear in mind that the author of this book was a young man from a war torn country with little education in writing so I am giving the writing style a break. Other reviewers who have criticized the author's writing are certainly valid. Nevertheless  Beah's story is powerful and readers will learn about this war torn region.    There have been a lot of questions whether this story is true. I cannot shed any more light on these rumors. It is clear that the story cannot be entirely true. For example, the specific quotes from conversations and the dreams are way too specific to be credible. How much is the story embellished? I do not know, but I believe it is important for authors to come completely clean when writing non-fiction. Even if only 1% of a non-fiction book is not true, authors need to disclose their readers. If we, as readers, discover the lack of complete truth of a non-fiction book then how can we possibly trust the facts of any part of the book? I would have liked a discussion or some notes about these issues. A similar book, \\"What is the What\\", is sold as fiction even though most of it was in fact true. I applaud the publisher and the authors of  that book for not misleading readers. However, even if \\"A Long Way Gone\\" is partially true only, it is still an educational book. I was happy that it was a relatively short book and at the same time was disappointed that Beah did not tell us how he finally got to NY.

B000021XS0|4.0|Ever since I first listened to Dream Theater, I enjoyed them.  Progressive Rock and specifically their progressive rock sound is so much different than what is played on the radio.  I love listening to something you don't hear very often.      I'm a huge fan of Pink Floyd and probably regard them as my most respected and favorite band.  No doubt then, The Wall is one of my most favorite albums.  SFAM is in many ways similar to The Wall.  One, it's a concept album which forces all the songs to need each other to stand making the album, as a whole, a complex organism.  If this wasn't a concept album, even with the same music, it wouldn't be a memorable for lyrically it would be weaker.  Two, SFAM is obviously strongly influenced by the Pink Floyd sound.  From adding sound effects, song introductions and endings, Gilmore like solos and an epic atmosphere, Pink Floyd is no doubt part of this albums former life.      Although a great album, it isn't a masterpiece.  Despite the interesting story, it falls short.  We needed the story to be on a larger scale, such as involving more people, more deeply involved and more plot twists.  When you really examine the lyrics, it's just a short story that you may read and make you think about life, but then put back on the shelf, never to be seen again.  Some of the songs are lyrically week as well such as, \\"The Spirit Carries On.\\"  For example, that song contains the lyrics:     If I die tomorrow  Id be alright  Because I believe  That after were gone  The spirit carries on    A third grader could have thought up this paragraph.  Not much ingenuity and creative writing went into this one song; although the solo isn't bad in the least.  This is personal opinion but some of the guitar solos are a big turn off for me.  They change tempo and switch back from different instruments.  I guess I'm more old school with Jimmy Page and David Gilmore solos.    Over all, a solid piece of work that I can enjoy listening to over and over again.The lack of radio time is the icing on the cake.
068987474X|3.0|A decade after reading this book I bumped it up by a star because it is accurate. If a guy isn't interested, he just isn't interested. However, if you like someone you should always encourage him to ask you out. You can ask him out by framing th question in such a way as to sound like you're suggesting a date but not actually asking him. For example, you could say &#34;Let me know if you want to grab some coffee one of these days!&#34; Then it's up to him to actually do the work of asking you out if he likes you. However, you've let him off the hook a bit because the chances of you saying no if he does ask you out for coffee is virtually zilch. After this initiation I would recommend cooling off and letting him do the pursuing. If he isn't, the he is definitely not interested.  This book is great and acts as a wake-up call for a woman who may fantasizing about a man who is not interested in her. I did not give it more than 3 stars because this book doesn't give you concrete, realistic, practical and effective methods to find your Mr. Right. I am a results-oriented kind of girl and I prefer books that get me results. This one convinces you not to delude yourself, which is great, but it doesn't teach you what you need to know to get the guy you want.
B000001FFJ|5.0|Tom Waits is really one of those artists that perfectly fits into the \\"love or hate\\" category, but no one can deny he is a great musician. Rain Dogs perfectly combines the experimentation of Swordfishtrombone with the melody of his early material. There are some \\"noisy\\" songs on here, but for every \\"noisy\\" song there is a softer one such as the beautiful \\"Anywhere I lay my head.\\" Overall even if you aren't the biggest fan of Tom Waits I think it is worth checking out before making judgments.

0679879269|5.0|so, i heard so much about how they \\"kill god\\".   be assured, it's absolute propaganda.   \\"god\\" dies accidentally because he's basically already dead, just hanging on for way too long.    very cool.    great story, great journey the kids take, and they grow up too, in a very tasteful way (i thought it could go south at that point, but he kept it very tasteful, nothing explicit).   cool musings about evolution with the sraf and these strange new creatures who ride on seed pod balls.   really interesting fantasy writing with the underworld, and very emotional development when lyra has to leave her daemon behind.   it's all great, perfect, and wonderful....     ignore these other posts obviously by christian fundamentalists who are crusading against these books.    it's  just good reading, and a great closure for the trilogy.  makes you feel all grown up after reading (um... i'm 32...  so, er.. yeah...).
B000VHPXR2|4.0|I have the three major recordings of this work.I prefer this soundtrack and love the others. The original U.S. album was produced for airplay and the arrangements and performers (Such as Ian Gillan of Deep Purple) result in a good rock album with a series of songs in a theme. The audiophile in me likes that album.  This soundtrack album, however, is the only great Rock Opera. Ted Neely, Yvonne Elliman,Carl Anderson, interpet the songs with dramatic voices. You can listen to this album and visualize the drama or sense the depth of emotions just as with a good traditional opera recording.  Since some have chosen to comment on the theology of JCS, let me just say this: People seem to either identify with a sympathetic Judas who has it together or discover a depth of faith in a Jesus that leaves people profoundly changed. It is not the intent of the production to do either, but--like the Gospels on which it is based--that's just what it does.
0887309372|5.0|This book contains the (infamous) 22 laws of branding according to Al Ries & Laura Ries. If you're looking for the Reader's Digest version of the message, here it is:<br /><br />  * Be first (invent your own category).<br />  * Keep it simple and focused.<br />  * Don't extend the brand; expand its category.<br /><br />But really, why take my word for the book's message when it's such a fun read?<br /><br />The language is simple, and there are plenty of images. You can skim right through it, or take the time to review the examples he gives of how big brands did the right (or wrong) things and come up with your own counter-examples.<br /><br />This book isn't just for big brands; the 22 laws generally apply to smaller businesses too.<br /><br />They point out that you shouldn't necessarily do the same things big companies do to become successful, even the ones known for success with branding. If you want to get rich by doing what rich people do, what you'll get is broke. You have to do what rich people did before they got rich.<br /><br />Yes, big company branding is what they're still teaching in most business classes. Just say no if you're growing a smaller organization.<br /><br />The addition of The 11 Immutable Laws of Branding on the Internet turned out to be a disappointment.<br /><br />The problem is that the Internet is a fast-moving target, and the book was written a few years back (its copyright is 2002). When they say:<br /><br />  The Internet will be the first new medium that will not be dominated by advertising...<br /><br />it's based on the way the Internet was then (remember bright flashing banner ads?)<br /><br />If the Internet isn't going to be dominated by advertising, you'd never know it by Google's advertising revenues. Advertising on the 'net is here to stay, and can be a key component of your marketing plan.<br /><br />Still, a great book, and a fun, fast, worthwhile read. I recommend it to anyone responsible for revenue growth.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|Across The Universe is the best soundtrack and most real version of anything that I have heard to date,  The actors and actresses express clear respect for the Beatles music and express utter awe for its power,  I hightly recommend that Beatles enthusiasts pick up a copy of this cd,
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I saw this movie because I am a fan of Jennifer Connelly, and I had heard excellent things about it. And most of what I heard was true. This is a grotesquely brilliant movie. It touched me and disturbed me so much that, like \\"Schindler's List\\", I don't think I ever want to see this movie again.<br /><br />I am a squeamish person, but I was entranced by the visions of ugliness created by the director. However, this is not simply a cautionary tale about the dangers of drugs. I believe this is about pride, the pride that many drug users have that allows them to think that they can control their drug use, rather than the other way around. It's highly effective.<br /><br />I dare anyone to watch this movie twice.
B0010358CG|3.0|When i first heard about this release i was very happy to find out that it was going to be released in blu-ray, and given the first Appleseed Movie(conventional animation) i expected this one to have the same intense gripping action scenes and storyline. How dissapointed i was when i watch the whole movie, it literally bored me to death with the weak plot and lackluster action sequences, if it weren`t for the beautiful visuals and stunning CGI effects of this movie(first by anime standards on blu-ray) i would have given this movie a 1 star. There was not enough action and drama to keep you excited, the story was shallow and simple and the voice acting was mediocre, even the climax of the movie was pretty lame. Overall this movie is a must have for hardcore fans only, if not you be better off renting it from Blockbuster or Netflix(if they have it) or just buying the dvd version which is alot cheaper than the blu-ray edition. I wish they should just have released FFVII: Advent Children on blu-ray instead of this, i would have been alot happier.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This was a delightful love story.  I love the music of the Beatles and thought it was put to artistic use in this movie.  Many memories flooded my psyche as I watched \\"Across the Universe\\".  I doubt it is award-winning by the industry's standards, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I would recommend it to those who grew up in the 60-70's, don't mind others performing the Beatle's music and like artistic interpretations of music.
B000OCXM68|5.0|I enjoyed the c.d. Michael Buble's voice is mellow and flowing. Truly a listening pleasure.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Overall, a very cleverly written, acted and produced gem of a tale.  Not for every taste, but definitely innovative, creative, and entertaining.      The print is excellent and when played on a HD player, it is surprisingly detailed.
0307346617|5.0|I love this book.  Brooks, you are AMAZING!  Read this, read this, read this!
0743496736|3.0|Nineteen Minutes was certainly an entertaining book - I finished all 400+ pages in a weekend. However, I can't say I continued reading the book because I was interested in the characters or the plot, but mostly because I couldn't tear myself away from Picoult's multitude of ridiculous stereotypes  and adages about high school life. Picoult lays it on thick, to say the least; as a high school student myself, I can't say I've ever witnessed (or even heard of) 99 percent of the occurrences Picoult describes in Nineteen Minutes. Every \\"jock\\" is tall, muscular, and witty; every \\"cool girl\\" has long blond hair. I wanted to slap each and every character at some point in the book - not because I was emotionally invested in them, as is usually the case with Picoult books, but just because people like that simply don't exist. While such characters aren't always a book's downfall, I found them very distracting in this novel.     Picoult also strays from legal realities when she insists on keeping Alex, the judge with a maternal conflict of interest, on the bench for a portion of the trial. Even more bothersome was Picoult's attempt to justify it to her readers by repeatedly exposing them to Alex's questionable thought process on the matter. This only caused me to distance myself further from the book and its characters.     In short, the book just read more and more like a bad teen novel as it went on, which was disappointing. The book was more frustrating than anything; it definitely showed potential, but was thrown off course by a lack of research and shallow, stereotypical characters. Definitely not Picoult's best work, but worth reading, I suppose.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|To get an idea of how convoluted this plot is, imagine channeling the spirit of Raymond Chandler, giving him a pound of dope to smoke and feeding him nothing but postmodern ideas for a few years.<br />The result? The Big Sleep on steroids; and just like The Big Sleep, following the plot is irrelevant. The movie is carried by loquacious, deliciously irreverent dialogue, and eclectic characters.<br /><br />Though based in Los Angeles, this film's aesthetic feel is not that of a big city. Compare its general tone, coloration and cinematography to Michael Mann's films, which DO filter the feeling of a big, sprawled urban environment.<br /><br />The Big Lewbowski hides its surroundings in the twisted minds of its characters.<br /><br />Since the plot is largely a ploy for dialogue, it is hard to summarize this film.<br /><br />All that needs to be known is that it is about a group of die hard, lazy bowlers, one of whom, The Dude, gets mistaken for a millionaire. After Jeff Lewbowski (aka the Dude) is mistaken for another Jeff Lewbowski (the rich one), some criminals break into his house and pee on his rug. From that point on absurdity reigns.<br /><br />I suggest not even trying to make sense of the labryntine plotline, nor the heliogabiline twists and turns. The best thing to do when watching this movie is listen to the witty dialogue and pay attention to each character's quirks and idiosyncracies.<br /><br />Walter (a bowler and vietnam  vet.) is undoubtedly the funniest character, representing as he does, old school nationalism and pseudo-masculine values. The Dude is a lazy sponge. He is the ultimate anti-hero. He spends most of his time (mis)regurgitating dialogue. His blazen attempts to plagiarize out of context make for some maliciously ironic scenes.<br />If you expect to get any large 'grand' meaning from this flick, you will not. There is nothing to get.<br />Just enjoy the humour, philosophy, and irreverance. If there is a moral, it is that life is found in the cracks, fissures, and crevices. The big picture often obscures this. Oh yea, and heroes are passe. This is the age of the everyman hero. What better everyman (anti)hero than the Dude?<br /><br />Each time you watch this movie, new s$%& will come to light!!cures this. Oh yea, and heroes are passe. This is the age of the everyman hero. What better everyman (anti)hero than the Dude?    Each time you watch this movie, new s$%& will come to light!!

006135323X|2.0|\\"Predictably Irrational\\" is an interesting book, offering several useful insights into human behavior. Unfortunately, the conclusions the author draws from these insights and the policy recommendations he advances are seriously flawed. They are devoid of thoughtful analysis and substantiation and seem motivated solely by the author's political orientation. Two examples illustrate this point, though many more could be provided.    In one chapter, the author notes that, in an attempt to combat excessive CEO compensation in corporate America, companies were required to publicly disclose these salaries and those paid to other senior executives. The result? CEO salaries increased because of the relative comparisons that were inevitably made by executives: \\"I'm as smart or smarter than Jones, so I should be paid as much or more than he gets.\\" I do not take issue with the notion that people measure their perceived worth against that of other people; from this observation, however, the author offers the following lament: \\"All this extravagance in CEOs' pay has had a damaging effect on society.\\" (Page 18).  Really? What damaging effects is Mr. Ariely referring to? We will never know because he offers no evidence to support this claim. Nada. Are the salary demands of professional athletes affected by their knowledge of the salaries paid to their peers? If so, have the compensation structures in the NBA, NFL and MLB had a \\"damaging effect on society\\"?  Since when is the dissemination of information about the cost of any item--whether it be widgets or the price you must pay to get a top-flight CEO or a good point guard--a bad thing?    Even worse, in another chapter Mr. Ariely concludes that because his experiments show that our buying decisions are often irrationally influenced by the initial price we are quoted and by our past buying experiences, he chooses to label the entire science of supply and demand a \\"fallacy\\" and to question our commitment to the free market and freetrade. Here again, he offers no evidence regarding the relative weight these forces should be given when weighing their impact on the economy--just his own idle speculation. And what does he propose? If you accept his unsubstantiated assertions, then, according to Mr. Ariely, \\"you may find yourself among those who believe that the government (we hope a reasonable and thoughtful government) must play a larger role in regulating some market activities, even if it limits free enterprise.\\" (Page 48).  Mr. Ariely, as soon as you locate on this planet a consistently \\"reasonable and thoughtful government,\\" I will be delighted to let it run our economy. Until then, I'll stick with what we have.    In a word, Mr. Ariely believes that because we sometimes collectively and individually behave in an irrational way, we need the government to save us from ourselves. If you believe that, you will love this book.
B00003CXCT|4.0|This product was never received. The DVD's were to be a Christmas gift and a week before Christmas I had to go to the mall and pay a steep price in order to have the gift for the holiday. While the payment was refunded, the non-delivery was a big disappointment.  However my son has enjoyed the videos and he now watches then with his own son.
B000VUFJ4Q|5.0|I knew the CD was going to be good but the extras on the DVD blew me away. They show just how down to Earth and in touch with her fans Taylor Swift really is and how much hard work she's put in to getting where she is. This girl is one to watch and this deluxe CD/DVD package is a must have for either a country music fan or a budding singer / songwriter.
B0010358D0|3.0|The producers of EX MACHINA have robbed Appleseed of its uniqueness and given us something that resembles a video game cut-scene.  The shiny cell shading that made the previous film so visually appealing is completely gone.  Everything looks like it's made of rubbery plastic and the people look and move like dolls.  Deunan's cute anime look has been removed.  Her eyes are much smaller and her lips are too thin.  The corners of her mouth are turned down much of the time, giving her an odd pouty look.  Briareos now has green \\"eyes\\" instead of red.  The streets are no longer paved with reflective material and the vehicles, for the most part, move on tires rather than hovering.  The city of Olympus has only one mirrored dome rather than two.  Furthermore, the music is nothing special.  There are no Boom Boom Satellites or Paul Oakenfold tunes to accentuate the action.  The English voices are all different and the dialogue is peppered with profanity.  Yet, much of the commentary track is devoted to telling viewers how \\"rushed\\" the 2004 version was and how much better this version is.  And the features on the bonus disc are devoted to telling us how great anime is, despite the fact that this sequel has been stripped of all its anime-ness.  Sorry guys, EX MACHINA is okay, but the first movie was not broke and therefore should not have been fixed.  Simply put, if you loved Appleseed 2004, you will most likely be disappointed with this effort.
0783227434|4.0|This movie was so bad I had to buy it.  Once you see it you'll never forget it. I am a fan of H.P. Lovecraft and this movie puts all of his frightening paranoia into it's proper perspective.  This is a really funny movie as the hero takes himself way too seriously and puts himself in peril because in peril is where he wanted to be in the first place.
