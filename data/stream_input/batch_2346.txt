B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Great graphics.  Entertaining game.  Best Hungry Shark game yet.  And it is FREE.  The slow-motion scenes when you eat people/fish/birds are very cool.
B009O07NMA|5.0|I love their music and listen to the cd all time!!!  So glad to see them win at the ACM on Sunday night.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Beautiful to watch.  Historically, may not be the MOST accurate, but, after nearly 500 years, who really knows.?  It does peak your interest to know more.  I've looked up several things because of watching this series.  Solid acting by all involved.  Very handsome men and beautifully gowned women. Interesting to glimpse into history.
B00571F26Y|3.0|From what I've read so far, its pretty informative.  Its interesting to see how he shows how the wheat grown today is the cause of a lot of our diseases.
0345529057|4.0|George Martin has mastered Scheherazade's trick of telling a long story in short installments so the reader is always in suspense over &#34;what happens next.&#34;  There's an army of characters
B0093X805W|5.0|This book is a great book to start with. I never liked reading and I was never good at it. But my mom got with my favorite teacher and she was Tudor. We word on fluinsy and word on reading skills. Overall it's a great book like the movie if you've ever seen it. Funny there's pictures and most of the chapters are short. I recommend it great beginners book and its a pretty easy read for those of you who just like to read.
B0038AUY96|4.0|Loved the book and couldn't put down!  Will definitely read more of the series. Wanted a better ending though. I guess this is how it is...engaging all the way then leaves u with wanting more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway surfer is a terrific game!!!!!!I understand that this game is about a character who is jumping on trans in the subway.
B00B19DMUE|4.0|The Possession follows a recently divorced couple and their kids. It mainly follows Clyde, the father, and Emily, the younger daughter, after they purchase a haunted box and release a demon. The Possession is a creepy possession film.<br /><br />The story in The Possession is creepy and often unsettling; I'm a fan of possession films and haven't seen a great one in a long time, so this was a pleasant surprise. I like the approach of the film; it doesn't rely on bone-popping, excessive vulgar language, or heavy special effects. However, I wasn't a big fan of the storytelling. A lot of events in this film occur spontaneously, and end suddenly - no lead up or continuity; for example, the breakfast scene suddenly starts, then ends rapidly without much explanation before and after. This happens often, even the music starts to build up then suddenly cuts to the next scene. I liked this at first, but then it got a bit repetitive, especially since it used the same music. It has some scary moments, both with jump-scares and disturbing imagery, and it at least takes some time to develop a sweet father-daughter relationship. Although it is often somewhat disturbing, the film is very tamed and never shocking, this may be a plus or negative depending on your taste. The acting was great, I really liked Natasha Calis' performance. The music was also great and atmospheric, although repetitive.<br /><br />The Blu-ray of this film has excellent picture and sound quality. However, the Blu-Ray lacks special features as it only has some audio commentary and trailers.<br /><br />Overall, The Possession is a great possession film; not the best, but definitely better than recent attempts, like \\"The Devil Inside\\". A purchase is recommended for fans of the genre, a rental otherwise.<br /><br />The Possession has some violence and blood.
B004SIP8JI|5.0|I'm a hugh Meg Ryan fan to begin with and eve though I usually am not a fan of &#34;fantasy&#34; type movies Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman make this so easy to  believe.  This is one of my favorite movies all all time.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Interesting story which keeps you interested throughout. The MacGyver  of outer space shows how he uses his knowledge and skills to stay alive in the harshest of environments.
B008OOYALE|3.0|This game is a lot of fun! It would be nice if you could make money and gold more easily. Lack of these can tend to make the game come to standstill, and then it gets boring!!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love the game... when it opens!! I have had to delete and re download this game two times but when I can play it its lots of fun :)
030758836X|4.0|Didn't think the end was as bad as most reviewers. It made a lot of sense given the crazy plot twists. Interesting and thought provoking for any married man.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I'm a longtime fan of Ken Follett.  He can't write fast enough to suit my hunger for<br />his books.  I had seen the film based on this book many years ago but had for-<br />gotten enough of it to make the e-book thoroughly enjoyable
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I must first admit, I'm a S. King lover. I believe there is ONE book that I didn't care for, but no King book I won't read. This one intrigued me for the longest time before I finally broke down and purchased the Kindle edition. I don't usually buy Kindle books over $8, but this one was worth every penny. I hated having to put it down to go about my daily business or to charge my Kindle. This one is a book to share with all my friends.<br />There are no supernatural monsters here. Even the time travel part of it seems to be normal in the way King writes it - totally acceptable as reality.<br /><br />King's ideas of the Kennedy shooting are, of course, one opinion; and he could just as easily write a second novel with the same premise but with the opposing view of the assasination - one shooter vs two shooters - and it would be just as thrilling to read a second time.<br /><br />The ending is perfect. I felt the same \\"OH NO!!\\" that King's character (Jake/George) felt and wondered how he would handle it - going thru it all over again? Resetting and letting the true course be as it should have been? King put a lot of research into writing this one and it shows. He does well with showing the differences between 1958 and 2011, though I'd have liked to see more - the differences are hugely abundant. Some of the questions a reader would have (did Al die after Jake came back? What happened to him?) weren't answered, but with the length of the book, it's not surprising.<br /><br />King hits time travel in a new and believable way with this one. Who knows if the bubbles don't really exist? Maybe someone DID go back and change the past. Perhaps Regan died the first time around. Perfect King, leaving the reader wondering, as always.
0307716546|4.0|Drawing comparisons to the likes of Kate Atkinson and Sophie Hannah, author Rosamund Upton delves into the psyche of an over-protective mother who is pushed to the limit following a traumatic experience.<br /><br />The school where her children attend is on fire and Grace Covey flies into the conflagration seeking to save them. This incident awakens in Grace a high sense of duty to protect her loved ones and begins her own investigation into the fire.  As Grace begins her private task she senses that her children may still be in danger and she will go to extraordinary lengths to keep them safe.<br /><br />A tale of well-intentioned obsession and a mother's undying love and duty towards her children.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I have never seen this show but I have heard about it from friends.  If you like the X-Files and lots of interesting characters, you need to watch this series.  The plot twists are unexpected and you really have to pay attention to what is going on.  I don't watch much reality TV so many nights I can't find anything to view, which is good because I am hooked on this series.  I am watching season 2 right now and very happy there is a season 3, 4 and 5.
B00BGZ8TVA|4.0|I bet in a month and another viewing I'd move to 5 stars. Very well done.<br /><br />These are my extra words required to submit my review.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Enjoyed this book from beginning to end. Cathy is a well written character and the story unfolds at a perfect (scary) pace. Great read.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Uhm... you have to read this one. Not only because they have made a movie of the first book and because the second movie premieres this fall, but because the story is uncanny and with no match. I read this trilogy in mere 6 days and. Well, 'nuff said, just read it.
0375842209|4.0|It's a sad story, but don't let that deter you from reading it.  Most stories set in Nazi Germany will be sad.  I was drawn to the main character as she survived each obstacle set in her path.  I was glad that the book ended on a positive note.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I'm not into zombie or horror shows, but got talked into Walking Dead.  Couldn't stop watching it.  Now I'm bummed that I  have to wait until October for Season 4!
B008602KQI|4.0|It may have been low expectations, but I enjoyed this much more than I had anticipated.  It was interesting to see someone else's interpretation of the characters, and I thought it captured the book as well as a movie could.  I should admit that I find the books interesting but also uncomfortable, and I had the same reaction to the movie.  Jennifer Lawrence was very compelling, even in her flatter moments.
B00BJS7LHC|1.0|how odd to mix terror and extreme violence with quirky... bad taste.  how did this get Oscar nominations? two words.
B009NX409M|3.0|Love De Nero and Streep but too much emoting and not enough movement. Worth watching but it's a bit unrealistic.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Makes you smile and have fun I also love how it will be very helpful when you need it<br />great for kid's or adult s of all ages
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book was one we chose for our book club.  It was well written and very thought provoking.  It made me say often what would I have done.
0062082353|4.0|As an American Korean war veteran, I am so happy to see the recognition of our fighting men in a positive fashion and one that shed true light on the skills and determination exhibited by our men at arms.  It is so awesome to see the improvements in our weaponry and the dedication to use them effectively.<br /><br />Records are not important other than to recognize levels of achievement and to give credit to those who pay the price to acquire the skills necessary to setting those records.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|After reading and watching the LOTR trilogy way more times than I should, I was worried that this would be a let down.  Not so!  It is definitely not LOTR, but it did a good job of capturing many aspects of the book, and I was readily immersed in Middle Earth once again.  Looking forward to the next installment.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|The movie was fine.  The historical facts, however, were embellished to make the movie show more drama and action.<br />I have no clue how this beat out Lincoln, Les Mis, or Zero Dark Thirty.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This is a book I couldn't put down.  It gave a wonderful picture of India which involved aspects of daily life from the very poor to the very rich.  It explained everything through they eyes of an interesting adventurous man.  He had love and great compassion for the country and its people.  I felt like I was seeing it myself and feeling it as well.  It is exciting and heartbreaking and keeps you wanting more.
0316056863|5.0|The book was in excellent condition upon arrival. The book is well written and quite hilarious. I just love Tina Fey's humor.
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|The story was fantastic and the scenery, costumes, creativity, and music were magical and spectacular. I was amazed and mesmerized.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|With all the hype about this movie, I expected it to knock my socks off.  This was just an average &#34;spy&#34; movie.  I think the thing that made it &#34;fly&#34; with the movies goers ...... it actually happened.<br /><br />While I left being entertained, I didn't leave going &#34;WOW&#34; that was the best pic of the year.
B005P1YCNK|4.0|Just finished the first reading. Ready to go through it again slower and really digest the specifics. This book has some very simple ideas that are going to make a big impact on my next 90 days.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|Simply put, this movie is brilliant.  Meryl Streep is absolutely flawless in her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher.  How she is able to do both the median aged MP and the aging one is simply proof that convincing acting is a true skill and a skill which Meryl Streep dominates completely.  The movie is excellently done.  And the biographical elements well portrayed.  Eventhough I am not a fan of Thatcher's economic policies, I respect the quality of the film.  And I think it merits five out of five stars and more.
B009O2XY12|4.0|This game is fun and addicting, but as you get to the later levels you will need to spend money, to get jewels, to get through them.
B005LLSZNM|4.0|I'm hooked! I don't have much time for television, but I could not stop watching. We just finished season 4 and can't wait to start season 5.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I was a big fan of Rush in the late 70s and early 80s and then drifted away. Recently I bought this album to see where they are today and I am thoroughly humbled by their phenomenal talent. The songs are awesome and seem to weave, on a few occasions, several melodies into one piece, something that can only be done after many seasons of musical poetry, experimentation and orchestration. Let this album grow on you and be amazed at where time has brought this band after all these decades.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Vulgar, Trashy and Juvenile.  Just as advertised.  This movie has no socially redeeming value.  It isn't even slightly funny in the least.  I kept expecting it to improve.
B00457WZEI|4.0|I read this with my 10 year old daughter and we both found ourselves wrapped up in the story far more than we anticipated. By the time we reached the scene at the horse auction near the end (no spoilers!) we were both ready to cheer. I am not a fan of animal books but this one won me over.
B009AMANBA|5.0|This is what has been lacking in Hollywood lately, a quality film.  The plot centers around Lincoln's machinations in getting the 13th Amendment passed before the Civil War's end.  All the issues, such as potential Constitutional violations, are brought out in the film.  And the attention to historical detail is overwhelming and well done.  The all star cast pulls through as everyone from Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones, and Daniel Day Lewis are so convincing in their roles that one leaves the movie with the feeling that one has actually met these great protagonists of history.  Don't expect battle scenes in this movie, as it isn't a war movie but rather a look at what transpired behind the scenes.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I hooked it up between the two available ports and now I can read! Don't let its simplicity belie its usefullness. A better cable some where else? Show me!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This CD Is Freaking Amazing! A Must Have In YOur Music Library And Is A Classic! System Of A Down Is DOPE!
B0060AY6FO|3.0|I suggested this book to our book club based on a USA Today recommendation. I almost didn't make it through the prologue. I realize it was written to reflect the style of Jane Austin, but it was just too wordy and detailed in areas that really didn't seem necessary to me. I did finish it, and I got used to the wording, but till the very end it still seemed to plod along. I did watch Pride and Prejudice halfway through the book and enjoyed it more after that.<br />Wouldn't really recommend that anyone read this.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|Some good computer action.  The story is not that good.  Way too much time floating around in the ocean with &#34;forced&#34; emergencies.<br /><br />And whats up with the island with the lemmings?<br /><br />Story ....Stupid.  Cinematography....OK
B003TTMFCK|5.0|I have always enjoyed Grey's Anatomy, and am really happy to be able to view it as part of Amazon Prime!
B000W94FE6|5.0|This book answers many questions I have.  It is neither a philosophy text nor a scientific one.  It's a combination of both.  Wish I found Mr. Csiksgentmihalyi's work earlier in my life.
B0082RHRHC|4.0|Jane Eyre is a good read, but the character would not survive well today unless she was twice as lucky as in this story! It was a little frustrating. She doesn't explore her leads and seems to just muddle along. It is very well written, though (obviously! It is a &#34;classic&#34;!) and had me almost speaking very antique English for a week lol!
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Love this album! Every since I bought it I can't stop listening to it. I listened to it everyday since i bought it! Really Amazing Album! >_<
B002APU580|5.0|I really loved this movie, but then, I'm pretty well a fan of anything Keira Knightley does. It was also a good reminder of the book which I liked, too. Matthew McFaddyen was really a good choice for Darby. Leaves out some details from the book, but don't all movies? I recommend!
B00AAQRNQ8|2.0|every thing seems to be ok with this mouse. However the mouse produces heat.  Even with the pulsing light shut off.
0316223239|5.0|Very entertaining book.  At first I was put off by the 5 year old child's narration but then it grew on me.  This book made me so attached to the little boy, I felt his fears, happiness, tension, curiosity, etc.  I initially did not want to read this book because I didn't like the premise but it won me over in just a few pages.
0066620996|1.0|Many things have been said on the lack of rigor and statistically valid inferences in this book. But it is not the unique problem of this manuscript. Self-helping and cheerleading literature, in general, favors positive examples to \\"explain\\" the successes of the past. Hindsight is always 20/20 and everyone knows it.<br /><br />What really signs death sentence to Collins work is the fact that he chose to study companies and companies that lived long enough to put shame on people who think they can predict the future with a pencil and a secretary. It's now 2013 and Good to Great was first published in 2001. It's been only 12 years since the publication and yet the list of hand-picked \\"companies of greatness\\" was blown by the wind of change. We all know what happened to Fannie Mae. Circuit City filed bankruptcy.  The rest of the list underperformed compared to S&P 500.<br /><br />In other words, Collins is not just \\"wrong\\" according to his own criteria. He is, in fact, completely random. He could as well throw a dart into a newspaper and come with similar results.<br /><br />So is \\"Good to Great\\" completely without merit?<br /><br />I don't think so. First, it pays to pick it up used for $0.99 and see how one of the most successful business series books are done. That is, sell pseudo-certainty to gullible people. Second, it teaches a student a whole lot about processes with infinite variance like stock performance. Third, Collins praises companies (like Fannie Mae) for exact same things (clever borrowing against future risks) that ultimately killed those companies.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Collins is a charlatan, but there are many lessons to be learned from his failures. It makes it worth one dollar.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|An excellent book! A very gripping story with a surprising end. I could not put it down until I finished reading  it to the end.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I have been playing this game for several months now and its pretty addictive!! It grows on you slowly.. love everything about it.. wish there were more such games.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This series is so clevely written, the location fantastic and the cast is spot on in my estimation.  There are characters to love, to root for and of course where would we be with not having those to despise.  I'm glued to each espoide to see if they get there's in the end.  The wonderful thing is that with so many cast members, I still feel satisfied that I am still involved within all their lives.  And if you love the clothes from the turn of the century era you will have you fill.  How sad it is for the cast members who work downstairs.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|I really like the book, I believe all the information provided is beneficial and helpful.  I have only lost two pounds however to date.  I am not going to give in though, I am going to continue this and hope to feel better and eventually lose the weight.
1400052181|5.0|This is a very well written book.  The author does an excellent job of covering the scientific material and making it interesting to someone (me) who does not find science an entertaining subject.  I did not want to read this book but it was chosen by one of the ladies in my Book Club so I gave it a go.  Much to my surprise, this book was extremely engrossing from beginning to end.
B008FPZQRO|5.0|As a fan of prog rock, Tarkus is one of my favourites recordings, along with other issues from ELP.<br />This time justice has come: excellent packaging, very good notes from the vaults and from Steve Wilson, interesting second disc and beautiful 5.1 remix in DVD.<br />And a very good price for all mentioned before.<br />Recommended for any serious prog fan.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|I like Dark Side of the Moon.  It is one of my favorite albums and the price was too good to pass up!
B00BHMF578|5.0|Acting was perfect, and each character played his/her part very realistically. The movie did a fantastic job of making the situation as accurate as possible, what a breath of fresh air. Eyes were glued to the screen for every frame.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|great game, makes you want to play again and again! especially if you like hello Kitty! I think others will love this game too.

1406830488|4.0|Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"Travels with a Donkey in The Cevennes\\" is an interesting departure from his swashbuckling pirate stories or his examination of good and evil in \\"Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\\" , being a short autobiographical work set in 1878 when he went on a twelve day, 120 mile hike while in his youth, in southern France. To carry his luggage he bought a donkey which he called Modestine.  As Modestine proved mulish, Stevenson gradually exchanged his humane principles for the stick, which he then made crueller by sharpening it into a goad.<br />Stevenson was prepared for brigands as well as difficult terrain, loading the donkey with a sleeping bag made up from green waterproof cart-cloth, with a lining of sheep-skin.  He took a revolver, a spirit lamp, a lantern and candles, a jack-knife and a large leather flask, and comforts that included books, a railway rug and bottles of Beaujolais and brandy.<br /><br />Modestine became central to his sojourn in The Cevennes where the small villages along the way provided him with little other company, Modestine proving less objectionable than some of the guests with whom he was sometimes required to share a room and even a bed. On one occasion he recalls that, \\"The sleeping-room was furnished with two beds.  I had one; and I will own I was a little abashed to find a young man and his wife and child in the act of mounting into the other.\\"  What he meant by \\"mounting\\" is emblematic of Stevenson's oblique humour.<br /><br />The modern reader might be taken aback by Stevenson's indignant response when knocked on doors at night in order to find hospitality but was, on occasion, refused.  The local population were often unfriendly and even amused when he sought directions after finding himself lost. Still, he found pleasure in his journey, despite the querulous donkey and the unwelcoming peasantry,  a pleasure that remains open to walkers today. He relished many moments on the rough mountain tracks, remembering one particular night when \\"the moon had been shining for a long while upon the opposite mountain; when on turning a corner my donkey and I issued ourselves into her light.  I had emptied out my brandy at Florac, for I could bear the stuff no longer, and replaced it with some generous and scented Volnay; and now I drank to the moon's sacred majesty upon the road.\\"<br /><br />Not only did he develop a taste for the local vintage. He also visited a Trappist monastery where he overcame some of his Protestant wariness of Catholic institutions, and found himself overcoming some of his own predispositions towards the French peasantry, and even became more understanding of Modestine's character, and less resentful of it.  In all, the short memoir informs the reader of an obscure part of France, and also demonstrates how a solitary journey can also be a journey of self-discovery and redemption.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1406830488 Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes]]ght when \\"the moon had been shining for a long while upon the opposite mountain; when on turning a corner my donkey and I issued ourselves into her light.

030746363X|5.0|Although Tim's approach to health and fitness is considered controversial and charlatan by many (perhaps by those who have something to lose or aren't willing to face the fact that they CAN succeed), I can tell you from personal experience that his methods worked for me.<br /><br />With the Slo-Carb diet I lost 19 pounds in 22 days, and lost up to 34 pounds total. People tell me \\"your a guy\\", and \\"19# isn't much on someone who is 6'3\\" and 270#\\", but I also had a girlfriend try it with similar success. (Okay, it took her 4 weeks to lose 18#.) It really works better when you follow it to the letter, as people who do not (I know several) don't get the same results, but the formula is there if you want it.<br /><br />I also used the 4HB for training purposes, using the Occam's Protocol program, and yes, it also worked well for me. I was able to double my gym results while eventually cutting down to one day a week. This is very helpful given that no matter how much I know I should, I simply don't like going to the gym. I did get a lot of strange looks from other gym rats for walking out 20 minutes after I got there, but they could not argue with the results as I turned them on to the book. Personal trainers probably hate this. ;-)<br /><br />I also took many other pieces of advice Tim gives in the book and low and behold....I got good results that I've incorporated into my everyday life. Some of his advice was avant garde, some did not appeal, and some I took to like a fish to water, but not all advice is for everyone...but for those that truly want change and are willing to be open minded enough to go for it, this book will serve them well!<br /><br />It also is well written, appeals to both my logical and emotional side and is an entertaining read. Well done Mr. Ferriss, and THANK YOU!

030746363X|5.0|My attention span is limited to a few pages of a non-fiction text every few hours. Tim's writing style allows me to get a great amount of information in a single, article sized pop. What I love about the book is that it is like a set of related articles, put together into a comprehensive, digestible book form. Unlike most authors that require you to swallow the entire concept of the book to get started, Tim provides numerous avenues down which the reader can walk depending on interest and commitment. For me, I found numerous helpful and insightful learnings that have helped me. Tim's genius shows in this book in dividends. I would pay $100 for this book.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The stories are creative and fast moving; the characters are perfectly type cast; the acting is the best on TV across all actors; Julianna Marguiles is wonderful!

034580404X|5.0|I have finished all three books, and they are great!  They take you thru the lives of the characters, and each book is better than the last one you read.  I highly recommend them to people who love something out of the ordinary.  These books are super sexy!!! and the stories are awesome!!!
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I would recommend this movie. IT was very good, but a little different than what I thought It would be like. Guess I wasn't sure what I expected. I had a little trouble keeping interest and would get lost. Otherwise the acting was great, some of my favorites!!!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Well written, high production value, well thought out, clearly a series produced by people who are fans of the book series.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|wonderful a great classic and it is readable for everyone I give it a B+ and it could be an A
B00C391Y3I|5.0|Saw Priest 2011, at San Antonio, Tx and Corpus Christi, Tx....  Best Priest concert ever!  I am so thankful they are releasing a Blu Ray....  Breaking the Law!  Breaking the Law!!!!!
B000SW4DLM|5.0|Love this movie, the stream was okay qaulity, really want to buy the Blu-ray with the orignal and the updated voice over version. I've heard mixed reviews on the voice over version.
0553106635|5.0|my son loves it. i guess this system doesn like short comments. so i will keep typing regardless of the stupid system.
B000002WFF|5.0|I had this album when I was in college.  I wanted to listen to all the songs that I loved by Elvis again.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Really?  This is what all the hype is about?  Wow.  I have read a lot of books crossing several genres and I can say with no hesitation that this is the worst book I have ever read.  It started as Twilight fan fiction?!  Wish I knew that before I spent the money on this!  And let me be clear up front, it is not because of the BDSM aspect.  If that's what two consensual adults want to do in their bedroom, more power to you, enjoy!  But that is not where the problem lies in this book.<br /><br />Let's start with the writing.  Wow.  No character development, no plot (really, there is NO plot) and the repetition is unbelievable.  Ana is constantly \\"flushing, blushing, whispering, gasping\\", etc.  We are constantly reminded that Christian is the most beautiful handsome man ever!  One more phrase about his long index finger, copper hair, hip slung pants, linen shirts, ugh.  Ana's lip biting, sharp intakes of breath, the awful e-mail dialogue....it just goes on and on.  Please, let me never read the phrase `laters, baby' again.  Please?<br /><br />How about the main characters?  They're both awful!  Ana is a boring, recent college graduate who apparently is only now being introduced to home computers, cell phones and email?  In 2011?  She is also a 22 year old virgin, which I don't have a hard time believing.  I do have a hard time believing she has had zero sexual contact with anyone, and has never had an orgasm?  Never?  Not even a self inflicted one?  Come on!  Through this entire book the author, and Christian tell us how breathtaking, smart, beautiful, fascinating Ana is, but all the author conveys is a boring shell of a character (clearly, Bella).  And Christian, where do I start?  A 27 year old billionaire?  Ok.  How?  The author only says he's the CEO, but how did he build this company, what does he do, why is he such a success at 27?  If you don't explain, it's very hard to believe.  Christian's character, for me, is the worst part of this mess.<br /><br />The sexscenes are laughable, not sexy.  Ana falls to pieces in orgasm about 17 times a minute.  A woman who never has had one up until meeting this sexy, good looking, controlling, possessive, abusive, crazy creep?  Mmmkay.  I can't even talk about the tampon scene - if you've read the book, you know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />OK, let's talk about Christian.  He is a damaged billionaire who because of abuse in his youth can only get excited about sex if its bondage and he is the dominant.  OK fine.  So he gets into a relationship with the naive inexperienced (to say the least) emotionally stunted, immature Ana who, for some reason, he can't stay away from.  He decides to enter into this bizarre sex contract with here indicating that he will control every aspect of her life, from what she eats, how often she exercises, and she better stay shaved!  Ana doesn't sign it, but decides to try this with some changes, like only working out 3 days a week not four.  But she's fine with the gynecological exam he sets up for her in his home; whatever.  Now the author has admitted to doing little to no research on the BDSM lifestyle - it took me 5 minutes of research online to see learn that this is NOT what it's all about.  Dominants do not control every aspect of a submissive's life.  So Christian is going to teach Ana about sex.  A man who believes that a woman can't get pregnant during menses; ya I'm not sure of his expertise.  Christian ends up buying her expensive gifts, stalking her, telling her how he wants to smack her, how jealous a person he is, making comments about her smart mouth, and the author conveys it as romantic?  Really??  Ana is constantly watching her behavior around him, fearful of making him angry.  But oh we're not supposed to see this as creepy or scary!  We're supposed to see that Christian is just falling so hard for Ana(again, why?), that he needs and wants to be with her all the time.  Let me be clear, obsessive possessive love is not love.  It isa need for control.  He stalks her, and she jokes about it.  Stalking is not love, it's scary.  Christian is no different than someone who hides in the bushes watching; the only difference is he has the money to stalk her high tech.  And Ana thinks this is funny and romantic?  No hunny, you're an idiot.  You're 22, not 15.  This type of behavior, unchecked, only gets worse.  Oh, and for those who think Christian is just all that, what if he wasn't so crazy handsome, or rich?  Still romantic?<br /><br />This book tells women that if a man is possessive, obsessive, jealous, controlling it means he just really loves you.  This book tells women that damaged men can be healed through the power of true love.  That is an immature and dangerous idea.  From what I've heard about the subsequent books, I'm even more nauseated.  Ms. James, I know you are being touted as someone who has helped women find their sexuality, but in my opinion, you've done more harm than good.<br /><br />Oh, and find a decent editor.  Just my opinion.  Laters.
B00B19DW0E|1.0|High school drama students, half drunk, could write better dialog and come up with a more coherent plot. Although Anderson probably laughed all the way to the bank, he should truly be embarrassed to have left such a gaping hole in the time-space of human existence.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I don't like the &quot;updated&quot; AccuWeather app. The previous app was great - 1 simple screen with today's weather summary. Now the app is convoluted and I have to dig for the information I want. IMHO they ruined the app.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed the British accents and the drama-filled stories of each season.  They keep getting better and better!
0553108034|5.0|my son loves it. i guess this system doesn like short comments. so i will keep typing regardless of the stupid system.
B002FU1GBU|5.0|Listened to this as a kid.  Great memories from long car trips.<br />Holds up well today.  My boys dig it now too.
B003DWC6IQ|4.0|Jeffrey Archer seems to have grown better as a writer following his incarceration. His post-prison books, besides being great stories well-written, contain an empathy for ordinary people that, maybe, was missing in his earlier works. A Prisoner of Birth is a well-conceived story that brings Dumas' classic Count of Monte Cristo into modern times, with improvements that someone like Archer can make. It's a riveting story that makes more unpredictable turns that the Count did, thus adding interest and excitement. The Clifton Chronicles are in similar vein. Archer's works are entertaining and well-written. Be careful, though: they can keep you reading late into the night.
B004MPRCTG|3.0|First, you want to know are the space scenes really 3D?  Yes, and it's great.  How do they do this?  And can the Hubble really see that far and in that detail? This what I am amazed at.  There is a sequence in this movie where you're taken on a trip into the Crab Nebula and see stars in the process of being born.  wow.  It seems that 3D technology is applied after the movie is created.  Therefore, can they convert any movie into 3D?  Leo DiCaprio is a good narrator, although his voice is slightly nasal.  I don't mind.  He speaks with &#34;heart&#34;.  The problem is that this is only 40 min. long.  It's over before you know it.  Just when you are settling back into your seat, it's over!  Also, it's just a primer for the &#34;rest of the story&#34;.  No deep scientific insights for adults.  Just to impress kids.  I keep asking myself, is this worth $30? .........  no.  This is the second IMAX movie that has fallen shor for me.  They all seem to be shallow and way too expensive.  No more IMAX movies for me.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|While it's a great idea, I usually use Pocket instead and don't often have articles I keep. It is a great idea if I was working on a book or a similar project.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|The only thing I found that could have been better about this movie is it's title.  While it is about Lincoln, it is about the Civil War as well, and so I feel the title should have reflected that.<br />That said, it was the only thing I would have changed about this movie. Not since Avatar have I watched a movie twice in a row!<br />D D Lewis WAS Lincoln, and the period costuming, decor, and language was perfect. Use of the English language then was much more articulate than now, and they were was spot on!  I appreciated that very much, since it made the movie that much more authentic.<br />Everyone should see this movie for the reality of the Civil War, and the meaning of freedom that all those folks gave their lives for.

B00BFBSV72|5.0|I love the game. I love it love it and love it! It is awesome game and again I love it so get this game!!!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|At first I didn't understand why I was reading a book written by a five-year-old, but once I understood it was an amazing perspective on what it would be like to be JC Dugard's child.
B00BSBVLF8|3.0|I was looking forward to seeing this after I had seen different &#34;cirques&#34; in Las Vegas and San Diego.  But the movie had a more artsy kind of feel to it.  The spectacle of the live show couldn't really be conveyed as a movie.  And the &#34;story&#34; behind it was sort of difficult to follow.  I suppose it's due to my own lack of exposure to the arts...ballet and things of that sort.  Having said all that, it was worth watching once. I don't think I would watch it again.
B0026ISUUQ|4.0|This one keeps your interest peeked as it zooms through the life of the main characters.  With goals set high, nearly too high to reach, they try their best to buck the system.<br />A great movie that gives you pause.
B0010X8NF0|5.0|Arrived promptly & was what I wanted. Typical Wes Anderson in that it will defy initial expectations. Needs multiple watchings to sink in but is a favorite. More about a mood set through the soundtrack, shot and actors.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|I kept waiting for this movie to get funny. I'm still waiting. IF you are married and overwhelmed with kids, then this might make you feel like, &#34;Hey everyone else's life is as bad as mine.&#34; That's the only 'positive' i can see from watching this film. Don't waste your money.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|Never used a program that has universal display across all platforms. The quality and buffering do not fight each other so I can watch 1080p videos on any tablet. Perfect!
B004KPQK2S|5.0|Loved this movie and Diane Lane plays an awesome part, as usual. If you love horses you will adore this movie.........even if you don't, the story line keeps your interest through the entire movie.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I really loved the Lord of The Rings series so I was totally excited to see the Hobbit being made!  I think it was very well done and I look forward to the next two movies in the series!  For those who have read the book, this movie covers the first 6 chapters.  It inspired my kids to read the book and that in and of itself was worth the watch!
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Got this movie at a great price just before Easter, with these super cute little hopping eggs.  The eggs were a hit and the movie was on the most wanted list here at our house too.  Digital copy is a bummer, can't get the thing to upload to our ipod.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Honestly not my favorite seson of the show, but this is still Supernatural we're talking about and I love it to bits.It's creative, funny, adventurously supernatural. I really can't rave too much because it would take far too long because this is my favorite series in the whole world. And I do not say that lightly.
0307352145|5.0|I bought this book at the airport and read it cover to cover on a recent trip.  What an inspiration.  It gives us the permission to shut up (and to suggest that other people shut up too).  I'm already using it in a class on public speaking!  I also find it useful for teaching a class on living in France, for students heading off to study abroad.  The respect for reserve in France has much in common with the introvert qualities described by Cain, and it is important for Americans to appreciate the virtue of privacy and minding one's own business, instead of being offended by people's lack of \\"friendliness.\\"
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Eva and Gideon story just keeps getting better. I cannot wait to read the next one. Ms. Day keeps you intrigued and wanting for more.
B00005K3O4|4.0|Just thought you should know the artwork on the cover of the DVD I received was the 2012 re-vamped version (dark and bland), not the colorful cover shown here.  Not what I was expecting but not a big deal.  I'm just happy to own a copy of the movie.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|I was unsure of Jacksons decision to make this 3 films out of the Hobbit... now I know why.  The film is very slow moving, the action scenes are way to long. The character development is shaky at best.  I love the story, the movie was fun, but there were some Jar Jar Binks / Boss Nass moments that I thought were unneccessary.  I am not a director, just an observer.  The movie is very long, and left me confused.  The ending scene was hokey.  The Audio mix is pretty unbablanced the action sounds are so big, they bury the dialogue.  Turn on subtitles.  I had too.  Otherwise, it was still very entertaining.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great book for a freebie, or anytime.  I really enjoyed it and actually looked for more by this author... good read.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I started watching the original Star Trek as a youngster and thought I had seen every episode. I was wrong -- or maybe I only saw parts of episodes. In any case watching season one episodes has been a joy. And I even &#34;get&#34; the meaning of some of the stories that I was too young to understand the first time I saw them. This time around the images I watch on the Kindle Fire are much of a much better quality than I remember seeing on the big old black-and-white TV that I watched during my youth. While the special effects have come a long way since the days when Star Trek was originally filmed they are still interesting to watch. Of course, that is the Trekky in me talking.
B00684J49U|5.0|Loved this series and had to have it for my library. I now have all the seasons available and enjoy them as much now as I did when they were on television.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I really like this. It charges my kindle and my Samsung Galaxy II phone. I like that it charges really quickly too.
B003M70O5O|3.0|Low budget filming in my hometown of sunland Tujunga CA. It keeps me interested only because I like to remience my past by watching where they shot the episodes
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|We watched this as a family, and even my 16 year old was laughing.  Good story, great graphics, great music.  I really enjoy this and recommend.  Good use of humar as a device not a crutch.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Some would cringe if they watched for only a few minutes, but this is first class historically accurate drama, with a strong cast of good to excellent actors. We're hooked.
B0046ECFRM|4.0|This was a fantastically romantic read.  While yes it is very formulaic it is told in such a way you forget you know exactly what is going to happen and eagerly read on to see how you get there.  You know girl meets incredible boy, but he has a girlfriend already who is totally wrong for him and girl falls in love with said boy and even though all the signs are there through a series of miscommunications and non-communications it takes them an entire book to figure it out.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the telling of this romantic story.  While yes at times I wanted to slap Anna and Έtienne St. Claire and say wake up and get together it probably wouldn't have been as satisfying as the actual ending.  The way the story was told with inklings of hope and moments of ah how sweet and such longing I longed along with it.  I enjoyed the setting of Paris as well it was great to discover pieces of the city along with Anna through her eyes.  Definitely one of the best YA romance novels I have read in a long time.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Music is great, I enjoy every track. Phenomenal beats/background and amazing deep lyrics. Glad that I purchased and have been able to expirence some good current conscious hip hop!
B001BKTEZA|5.0|When I read this book I can totally imagine the era of America when people worked hard from dawn to dusk and families lived together  children through grandparents and the country side was most of what the county was . I enjoy this book
B00BWJARHO|2.0|It was a great movie of course, but each time i tried to watch it, i couldn't get it to buffer! When it starts slowing down it automatically drops the quality level.  I had high-speed internet, and a full connection, but according to the video my connection speed was &#34;very slow&#34;. It was not worth the $4 at all.
B000001F29|5.0|I have been a fan of Jon Andersons collaborations with Vangelis.  The audio quality of the recording is very good it is unfortunate that it was overlooked (for the most part) when it was originally released.
B004YCKK6Y|4.0|I can't believe this is not available in Blue Ray yet.  C'mon guys, let's get it together and put it out.
B000YEUUCK|1.0|I was especting to see  a different show. I felt that I was watching the Cirque De Solei show. I don't recommend it.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I am enjoying a casual, untimed game. The dialog is standard, but not lengthy and cute. Puzzles are entertaining. Worth downloading.
0062014102|5.0|If you are even considering purchasing this book, I would highly recommend it. It provides an insightful approach to conceptualizing, understanding and applying the holographic model to our own understood realities.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Read the product description.  This program does what is says it does and does it very nicely with a good interface.  I am using this on a Windows 7 work station, a Windows 8 pad, a Kindle Fire and an Android phone.  It works between the four seamlessly and integrates with IE-10 in a nice way.
B00A4Y9BT8|4.0|Over the years I have bought the albums over and over from moving so many times, but buying this on the cloud player is great so and i can travel anywhere with it.
B006WXHJNU|3.0|I really just got this to complete my Avengers movie collection.  I'm not a fan of either Hulk movie, but this is fine if you like the Hulk.
B003PBB4ME|3.0|Bought this to use with my DSLR with the original lens, and with just that and my Rode shotgun mic it was fine.  But as soon as I tried to add anymore accessories (15mm rod support system, matte box, zoom H1, etc.) the handle began to bow and flex which slightly defeated the purpose of stabilization.<br />So for a light rig, it will work fine.  For anything that's got any weight to it, look for something else
B00008O31I|5.0|I love this band and I needed it on vinyl so I'm happy with it. It's what I needed. thanks
B008602KQI|5.0|I have not read the books but I would be more than happy to watch this movie again. Just maybe not with small children because there are scenes of kids being killed.
0596805888|5.0|This is a great book for people who want to know how things work in the kitchen and why. Its a fun informative geeky view of how to cook.
B0026SFEW8|3.0|I still love the music and the actors in the main roles. I don't find the story that interesting anymore and I find it harder to get past how old these &#34;high schoolers&#34; are. Overall an OK movie
B001DRF84W|3.0|I only bought this to complete my Avengers movie collection.  Its fine if you like the Hulk, but overall, meh.
1476734941|5.0|All my girl friends would enjoy it. We're alwaysb working on being slim & trim. Many ideas to enhance your well being.
B007FGPZTS|5.0|I gave this to my friend for her birthday and she loved it so it was a success. thank you
1401201911|5.0|This comic is the best comic I have ever read which really is saying something! The story line is done well enough that I think it rivals books and novels. Then it incorporates many hero's of the DC universe in such a brilliant fashion (keep an eye out for Green Lantern!!). Definite buy for any comic fan.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This is the second installment to James Dashner's &#34;Maze Runner Trilogy&#34;, and of all the books, this is definitely a close second (the first in first). It is an amazing book, one that I personally could not put down. It absolutely deserves a 5 star rating.
B003U4ZQUM|5.0|Awesome.  I watched all seasons 1-6  I am disappointed there were not more seasons.  It was great to be able to stream this onto my I Pad.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wow, what an ideal, accurate portrait of life as it was in the 19th century<br />Yes yes yes, it took me to a place I can never see.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Was a very interesting book can not wait to see how they turned it into a movie in June! Worth the read
B006YZOXHQ|3.0|This is a sort of cult classic, but not quite. I enjoyed it ,but it was pretty bad, yet fun to watch. Obviously her husband had a lot to do with her acting and costumes.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Bought the DVD and CD, this is a very high qualiy concert featuring a cast of world renowned musicians, a must for any collections.
B008XG1X18|5.0|And I Love it! Five stars from me.. There are some real nice projects and it's all free!! Great job to whomever thought this up..<br />Thanks for a refreshing app.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The Good Wife has a subject line that is different than most series in that it contains real life situations that don't have gruesome crime scenes and subject matter that sacrifices a good story for the shock value.  You are totally involved in the many personal relationships as well as a different political or legal drama in each episode.
B0096HL33G|2.0|It was slow and even though it does happen that our heart goes the way that is not good for us, I  don't want to see it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I found the stories very interesting. How women were not free but sometimes ruled the men in their quite ways.  Freemon of women was not yet an issue.  Women were property of the male head of the household.  Interesting how the different classes of society were then.  Sometimes they would cross either up in class or down in class.  The workers had it hard but were probably happier than those with money.  Would recommend this series to anyone.  Well Done!
B004GYY714|4.0|You can listen in bed or elsewhere and not disturb your mate.  I enjoy talk radio in the morning and this is the way to do it.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Another great book by Kathy Reichs.  I have to admit it's hard to figure out some of the French references, but really good read.
0385535147|5.0|I am a fan of John Grisham, and this one was very good. Always a good story line and a fast read for me.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Season three continues on with the great story lines that kept up captive in Seasons 1 & 2.  The focus is different in each continuing season and really holds your interest.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Season 2 was just as great as Season 1.  I love how the classic stories have been retold and entertwined!  I can't wait for Season 3 to start!!!
030746363X|5.0|I was incredibly skeptical going into this book, yet every tip I've adopted from 4HB has worked out.  I began by adopting the slow carb diet and PAGG -- immediate results that I've sustained for a year and counting.  Tim's advice on insomnia.... worked.  On waking up without coffee... worked.<br /><br />This is the missing manual for the human body.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I never understood why this series was canceled? The stories are a bit simplistic but they were entertaining. The cast was engaging, the stories entertained and I think worth watching. If you are not s Sci Fi fan this series is not for you but if you are and you haven't seen any of these stories it is worth the time to watch the series.
B00A4OALL0|5.0|This is by far the best produced pure jazz album in a while and it comes as no coincidence that it was produced by a living legend- Mr. Wayne Shorter himself.<br /><br />The energy and intensity displayed by Mr Shorter and his crew on this album is simply breathtaking and literally takes you back to the bebop era of Miles Davis, Monk , Coltrane and Wayne Shorter himself.<br /><br />Beautiful.<br /><br />I consider this a masterpiece and my jazz album of the year despite the fact that  we are only in the 4th month of the year 2013.<br /><br />it is simply unbeatable!!!!
B00866JL96|5.0|Stories written from a North Carolina author always catch my eye, since it's my home state. I love Nicholas Sparks sweet stories, and love it when they are made into movies. I have purchased them all and have watched many times. My own personal opinion is that the novels are always better. I could not part with my collection.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Liked this movie, lots of action like his other Mission Impossible movies.<br />Would recommend to anyone who likes this type of movie.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I don't have to wear my reading glasses when using. It also has math functions I can use in my daily work
B000KK0AKU|4.0|Even after all these years this movie is still steaming hot. The plot is thin but the situations are sexy and a bit crazy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A gripping story that seems to change with every chapter. It makes you want to keep reading to see what happens next . Complex personalities and characters will have you hooked.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|this is a very fun game.  I'm only writing this to make the annoying \\"rate us\\" banner from showing up.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I usually find soap shows corny and stupid. This clearly is different. Maybe because the topic is rustic and actually has good writing and acting. I found it entertaining and a worthy investment of your time.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love, love, love this show.  I'm a true Walking Dead fan.  Always leaves you wanting more, lots of twists and turns.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|what a game!i love this game its just like temple run but you dont have to rotate your tablet. great fun. i recommend this game to any one even parents maybe even grandparents!
B0017QSZW6|5.0|This is one of the most lavish and exciting portraits of Henry the VIIII and his love affair with Anne Boelyn. It is beautifully filmed, the images, and actors are beautiful and you keep wanting more.  I have seen the whole series and I love it. If you like history and mixed with a little historical this is the way to go.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|From the beginning, I thought it was chatting good, buuuttt it changed directions and the ending was predictable and kind of stupid.
B00122EX4Y|4.0|I bought this because I like Emmylou and Knoplfer. Their blend is kind of unusual but, I like it. It has some great songs.
B001QVFDA4|4.0|I think guy ritchie is the man. I loved snitch and obviously sherlock holmes. This was an original movie but didnt knock my socks off. Sometimes a movie is better a second time around because maybe It was just the day. I would still recommend purchasing the movie and investing your time if you like guys movies.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I have recommended this show to several people. I really enjoy it and cant wait for the next season to start!
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|Very funny realistic movie. The kind of movie that people as a married or a couple can seriously relate to.
1451668945|5.0|Kate Connolly is in a coma. Gus Schmidt is dead. The Connolly Fine Antiques Reproductions factory rests in ruins in Long Island City from a massive explosion that was obviously set. What were Kate, and former employee Gus doing in the museum section of her family's furniture factory at 4 AM.?<br />Since the boating accident that claimed the life of Kate and Hannah's mother and uncle there has been something not quite right. Hannah, just a baby when the accident occurred, is now a promising clothing designer, older sister Kate a highly respected CPA. Douglas Connolly, the girl's father, seems to have lost interest in the factory, and his daughters, and turned over the everyday business to a man named Jack Worth. Clyde Hotchkiss is a decorated Vietnam War veteran who has been living on the streets for nearly 30 years and lately sleeping in a wrecked Connolly factory van.  Is he responsible for the death of a young college student whose body was found floating in the river? And, did he have anything to do with the disappearance of a young actress, twenty-eight years ago?  Or, was that Jack Worth?<br />Mary Higgins Clark, infamous for her one-page chapters, spins a yarn in \\"Daddy's Gone A Hunting\\" that dates back almost 30 years. With a master's touch for suspense she brings together seemingly unrelated characters into a scenario of intrigue and mind-boggling bewilderment. Nothing is ever what it seems in Clark's books. You always have to look beneath and beyond the obvious. What was the meaning of the recurring dream in Kate's coma? And, what were Kate's only spoken words? They pretty much tell all.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|My grandson downloaded this game on my tablet and is having a lot of fun playing it while he visits with me.
1440503257|1.0|I was fortunate to receive this as a gift and not waste my own money on it. I will state that while I am not British, I lived over there while going to Uni. I have to agree with the other 1 start reviewer from England that I don't think the author has ever actually lived in England. Even that aside, very few not worthy \\"Harry Potter\\" meals. Lots of assumptions (while fully admitting to stereotyping) and the pasty recipe is not very good. With Harry Potter, you could create a lot of fun recipes that while not canon, are more thematically appropriate, or play with the ones that are canon (ie a good Rock Cake recipe and ones closer to what Hagrid makes). Overall I would say just google Harry Potter recipes and you'll get some fun results (like real butter beer, which is missing from this book!) or just buy a good English cooking book. This is a complete waste of money and you will be highly disappointed.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Its perfect. My nephew loves it and wears it often. You can't go wrong with this logo anywhere at all.
B0031RS3K8|5.0|From the point of view of a nurse, I think this puts into words what I have always believed!  A great little read, loved it.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|Good graphics, easy controls, very few IAP's, lots of different planes, and fairly realistic. Would be 5 stars, but about 1/3 or1/2 of the way thru it starts to take a long time to unlock things.
B000UJCO7S|5.0|I recently saw this movie on AMC and knew right away that I needed to own it. David Morrissey is &#34;outstanding&#34; in this!!!!
B00BGIC3T6|3.0|It's not as funny as I thought it would be. I wasted 14.99  i am very very disappointed :( wish I could get a refund!
B0043RGXJS|4.0|a great selection of songs, sung by a classic, very strong voice.  very enjoyable.  i happen to find it eclectic, new to me.
B007MOU6ZQ|4.0|If you have ever wondered why you are not moved to participate in the Harvard Business School movement that has swept across the Western world and permeated almost all workplaces, this book explains it all and your own innate distrust of KPI's and alike!
B000GIXEIG|3.0|Hate to sound like a snob but I love the original epic poem of Beowulf so very much that I guess I'm extra hard to please when others who love it, too, try to put the story on film.  Ingvarsson's vision is interesting---Grendel is discriminating in his murdering frenzy, which humanizes the fiend, so fits within the context that King Hrothgar murdered his fiendish father but spares him when he was a lad...but to me, seems a tiny bit off.<br /><br />In this particular case, the special features are the best aspect---hearing about the vision and story arch, watching the creators compete with the weather in Iceland to make the film...  Really quite interesting.<br /><br />The retelling stays only with the first half of the story---the hero Beowulf (who of course &#34;err's&#34; with the same kindness Hrothgar in the end).  There is an added character here too, who in terms of this interpretation of the story is very interesting and I liked her---won't give that part away.  But I'm always troubled how filmmakers strip King Hrothgar of everything, dignity and wisdom as well.  Hrothgar is at the end of his life---but it was a noble life, he was a Great Goldgiving King who left a great legacy of community in building Heorot.  Then the demon fiend threatens to take all that away, yes.  But Hrothgar isn't pitiful, and in the original there is no hint that i can find (having studied it scholarly for over 20 years) that even suggests Hrothgar is to blame or has any filial connection with Grendel.  And Hrothgar, though weakened by age and too many battles, still has a wealth of wisdom to pass on to Beowulf.  In fact his only &#34;weakness&#34; is seen through Wealtheow, his Queen, who is concerned that Hrothgar has grown so fond of Beowulf as a kind of son to him that he might neglect his own two sons when it comes to leaving them his kingdom.  Read the poem---it is work, perhaps, because it is unfamiliar in our current culture---but it is worth it.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a fun epic hero story from the Nordic area with harsh weather conditions and viking heroics, you'll enjoy the film.  But if you're looking for a true adaptation of the great epic Poem in full, devoted to the glory as well as the tragedy of Beowulf's story (hero in Denmark, yes, but failed king in Geatland because he didn't take Hrothgar's wisdom to heart), the film will leave you hungry.  (Remember, key elements of the poem were the inspiration for Tolkien's Hobbit and Ring trilogy...)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The best book ever<br />Really liked how it ended<br />The fact that  cat had kids also<br />There's no games any more
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I found the free version to be very inviting, so I decided to purchase the more advanced game. I hate to pay for games, but found it well worth the fee.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|The Swiss Army Knife of battery information.<br />After running the calibration, it shows the projected run times for all the normal activities
B00B23O96A|4.0|I love Eric Clapton and have enjoyed this CD, but it<br />seems a real departure for him: somewhat folksier<br />thank I expected.
B0074YVW1G|5.0|Fantastic portrayal of how I feel I am misinterpreted by many and understood by so few and why I do not share well.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|It's a gift for Saint George's Day, celebrated in Catalunya on April 23, so we have not tried yet ;)
B00992CF6W|5.0|Would recommend to others . Love to build structures. Can use my imagination I have a son with ADHD and he uses it a lot and it keeps his mind busy being able and slows himself down
B004FOA84A|5.0|I loved this application. This game was terrific. The only down side, is once you have finished and find the secret of Grisly Manor, it is all over with. It would be great if they could update this with new adventures.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn's stories are frighteningly possible and always a battle between the good guys and the bad.  What makes them immensely entertaining is that there are also struggles between the bad and the not-as-bad, and the good and the naive (or selfish or arrogant).  This gives the story terrific realism and adds depth to the various characters.  The Last Man was no exception.<br /><br />I just hope that somewhere there is a Mitch Rapp and an Irene Kennedy; just as I like to think there is a Dirk Pitt, a Jack Reacher, and a Philip Mercer (there are more, but these come to mind).
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I absolutely love it so far. I've only used it two or three times but it's great thus far. I'm a big Cafe'  World player and when I saw that I was able to click on neighbors request and send them item they needed I was sold. I use to be able to do that from my iPod but no longer can. Thanks so much for this app.
B00498YZH8|5.0|Disclaimer: I'm not a movie reviewer.<br /><br />But I was impressed not only with Lawrence's portrayal of the unintended matriarch, trying to keep her world as she knew it together and look after her own as she was taught, but the cinematography was appropriate for the content as well.  It didn't really strike me until after the movie, but it just seemed visually ... authentic, or proper; correct? ... as well.  Also to its credit, I liked that the movie didn't lean towards any unrealistic, super-heroine, revenge antics or short-change itself with some unbelievable outcome. Anyway, having only seen Lawrence in Hunger Games & a forgettable X-men role, I thought she was truly impressive (considering her resume at that point) in this movie.  Gritty, painful, and rewarding without losing its ideal.  Worth watching & recommended.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Love trying to draw the words to opponent.<br />From stick figures to excellent drawings between my<br />opponent friends is a gas.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|What a marvelous, sensitive and humorous movie this was!  Well cast and perfect character portrayals.  A loving chronicle of a group of \\"mature\\" people (Give us a break!  I'm almost 78 and HATE to be called \\"old\\" because that's not how I feel or believe I am inside!).  The group finally welds together at a run down, barely there hotel in Jaipur, India.  Each character is taking a shot at trying to make right their struggles with a physical handicap, a partner who disapproves of everyone and everything (especially her mate), widowhood, a former lover, a femme fatale whose \\"attributes\\" have spread out, fallen down and are misfiring, and a man in desperate need of Viagra to fulfill his fantasy as a \\"stud-still-in-residence\\"! Young love is struggling too, as the ambitious young owner of the hotel loves a young woman whose family couldn't be more disapproving (not to mention his own interfering obnoxious mother); he's trying to redeem himself in the eyes of his family by making a success out of the seemingly doomed hotel he loves and wants to reinvent.  He is obstinately refusing to recognize that his hotel can't even provide basic amenities for current guests and hardly encourages future patronage - if it survives that long!  The sights and sounds of Jaipur are colorful, noisy, and make your senses reel and jump for joy.  Life is so different in Jaipur and it is unlike anything any of the group have experienced before, except for one group member, a former resident of Jaipur, looking for a lost love from years ago through circumstances that will bring you to tears.  This group overcomes prejudice, physical and mental disabilities, uncomfortable surroundings and chronicles inconveniences unimaginable under most normal circumstances.  The guests find a welcome release from the tedium of life they have been drowning in as well as a renewal of their internal juices and bright hope for their futures by new surroundings, strange food, customs and dress, and the freedom from fear of harsh censure by finally expressing their personal likes and dislikes; they also discover a new way they can live out the remainder of their lives under better, warmer and more loving circumstances.  Whew!  All that said, I encourage everyone (not just \\"mature\\" viewers) to see this movie.  If you're young or middle-aged, you might get a new perception of what lies ahead for you; you may learn how you can get a jump on those bumps in the road that may occur.  Know this for sure:  As long as you're still kicking you can change yourself or your circumstances if you set your minds and hearts to do so (except getting rid of arthritic pain and body parts that won't work the way they used to when you were younger [Oh!  Oh!])!ear of harsh censure by finally expressing their personal likes and dislikes; they also discover a new way they can live out the remainder of their lives under better, warmer and more loving circumstances.

B004X80QNG|5.0|I apologize. I do not remember this application. Evidently, I have deleted it from my tablet. I am still giving it a 5 star rating though. Sometimes, I just delete application which I do not use or have too much memory.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|My girls LOVE this movie! We bought it for them for Easter and they were so excited! I have to say this has got to be the cutest movie since Despicable Me. =)
B007ZXK08C|5.0|What an awesome book - just wanted to keep reading. So many unexpected twists and turns and had a love hate relationship with the 2 main characters. Would never have picked the ending.  Highly recommend.
B004GYY714|5.0|Wow I just love this app and if you need to listen to a radio station that is not local this is the one for you. Now I live in a area where I don&#34;t get the Houston Astros on tv and the local radio would either carry a ladies A&M sporting event so this lets me here my Astros  anytime . Thanks . Godspeed !
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Not much action but I still do play it from time to time.<br />It's actually kind of fun getting the timing and the coins<br />to drop in a spot that is good.
B00BF11STU|5.0|i thought the movie was well done.  riviting and held your attention from beginning to end. it was a dicey mission that they pulled off,
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I have since deleted this application. Not because I did not like it, but because it took up too much memory.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|My brother has been boasting about this series for a while so I just had to get them. Love them! =)
0765325950|4.0|I am happy that the story has finally ended, and how it has ended.  The series is a tiny but very enjoyable part of my memory for half of my life. :)
B002W5UVSM|5.0|If you like New Orleans , this is a must read. I am currently on my second read of the book, cannot put it down. The characters come alive.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Fun game to try and match the tiles up so they poof.<br />Like the concentration it makes you use up.
1616615362|5.0|FFGs XWing game is one of the best new games of the last year and this addition really pushes the bar. The models details are excellent, all the other components are also top knotch. Up your game and get one of these.
B004SRNH10|5.0|I find this one of many applications that are needed to play and run your games and apps, both on my tablet and my computers.
B004G6009U|5.0|We had this movie and then left it at my mother's one time we visited, haven't seen it since. So I was looking for movies to buy for my girls and saw this, great price and the price was the reason we got it for our girls. They love this movie and I do as well, so cute. =)
B008EKMB82|5.0|The story flows well, and the writing is simple.  Yet it is like a quiet stream that has wandered through high mountains and low valleys, it carries stories that are worth your time to put aside other things in a busy day, and just take a dive and briefly live as a different being in a different world.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|So glad it ended the way it did.  It was a fantastic read from the beginning. Had a hard time putting it down.
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|I love Grohl's projects. He is the most relevant rock and roller out there today and I'm happy he's as active as he is with his love of music and dedication to his fan base.
B00BOLFRKW|2.0|Why I did not like the service provided is it would not play HD on my computer, and the streaming service lagged and buffered.<br /><br />1st.<br />My home system is ok certainly far more capable than an Xbox, kindle or tother approved device at displaying proding quality video output.<br />NVIDA GeForce GTX 670, 32G Ram, 8 core AMD, OCZ 256G PCIE SSD.<br /><br />2nd.<br />Poor streaming, it would sit an d buffered a few times.<br />I have 40Mbs downstream service, granted that probaly as advertised but not actual , but I would imagine even half that speed would be fine.<br /><br />I think it will be a long while, if ever, before I try this service again.
B00947N6D8|5.0|My son loves the movie. He can't stop talking about it. I would recommend the movie for anyone to watch.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|My brother has been boasting about this series for a while so I just had to get them. Love them! =)
B0094K1PW4|3.0|Expected more from Spielberg and Abrams in this one....weak story line. A little more plot development would have gone a long way.
B004LROUW2|4.0|A love story set in 1984 Japan, with fantastic twists and parallel worlds and people hearing voices. It's fantasy, and a thriller/detective story, and a love story. Very ambitious. Murakami sends you to these fantasy worlds that are still very realistic, very anchored in everyday life. He follows the thoughts of the characters with uncanny realism.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|the middle schoolers seem to really like this game. As for adults - pretty mind numbing. Looks good on the Kindle HD
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I cannot say how much I love this show. I would pre-order season 3 right now if I could.  This was a gift for my sister and she came over and opened her present on the day of the season 3 premiere.  We were planning a marathon prior to the new season starting.  We were super upset to find that disc 4 was missing.<br /><br />However, Amazon is fabulous.  I contacted them explaining the situation and they worked with me to replace the missing disc.  They sent a new season and I sent back the one with the missing disc.  THANK YOU AMAZON!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Good job with v2. Like the game much different than the first game takes a while to load but once loaded not to shabby
B001NLL93W|5.0|My brother has been boasting about this series for a while so I just had to get them. Love them! =)
B009U9S6FI|5.0|It's a combination of a humble man's sad life story together with helpful insights about life and its meaning. Recommended.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great writing..like a good book I can't put down! Looking forward to season 4! Watched the first season on DVD all in one day!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I play this game all of the time. I cant stop playing this highly addictive game. I curse my kids for making me play!
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|This a wonderful movie.  It is very hard to watch due to the subject matter, but it is worth it.  I have wanted this movie on bluray for a few years now because I felt that high definition would be beautiful for this movie.  The black and white picture looks amazing and although this movie illustrates one of the worst moments in history - it is a touching story well worth the watch.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The second season was better than the first! As I got to know the characters, their lives became so interesting. I cannot wait to start the 3rd seadon
B00BHMF578|2.0|For entertainment purposes, I think that SKYFALL should have won the Oscar for Best Picture.  And why Alan Arkin was nominated for an Oscar, I don't know.<br />Perhaps because of the hype, I was let down.  In any case, it was predictable (and there ARE ways to make historical films suspenseful even when we know their endings).  Not a horrible film - just way way overrated.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Couldn't put it down. My new favorite Stephen King novel. Great story. I'll Definitely read again. If you like King's novels this one is a must.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Have read every Harry Bosch book -- love them all -- very quick reading, entertaining, exciting and always a great twist!
B00136NYR6|5.0|great record. equally enjoyable on headphones or through open air. sounds wonderful, stonesy, cant get over the sound of it, spectacular.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I love this movie.  That is why it got a 5 star review, BUT and this is a bit BUT, I am annoyed that they only provide an Ultraviolet digital copy.  I have purchased other Bluray movies recently and they offer BOTH Ultraviolet AND iTunes.  You can redeem both, why did New Line Cinema not offer that?  If there was one reason to give this less than 5 stars that would be it.  Get it together movie studios.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This update is amazing!  I am glad to see barometric pressure is added.  It is handy for seeing if the weather is changing.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|The characters and plot are incredible.  Setting is really creepy.  Jessica Lange, Lily Rabe and Evan Peters (who I did not care for in the first AHS) are really impressive, but it is Sarah Paulson who steals the show.  Scary and engaging - I watched the whole season in a week.  Do yourself a favor and buy this.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|great great great and triple great. great story, felt so real and normal, the characters were sometimes hilarious, the chemistry was great and most of all, the author was good at portraying what i call 3D characters, i mean by that, that they had depth. Even the lead character was imperfect and more than once did i find myself screaming at her and rooting for that poor boy Travis. :)
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game is simple and fun. You can get different kinds of animals with out buying anything. It's also addictive.
B004LROUNG|4.0|It didn't hold me on the edge of my seat but when I put it down, I kept thinking about getting back to it.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|Good performance by Justin Timberlake too.  Clint can play the character that discovers a new generation is coming into play more and more very well and still has the wisdom to know when and how to pass the pass things on to others, just in his own way.
B00A2DIW3C|5.0|Having worked for a company that manufactured the navigation systems for the YF-12A and the D21-Drone, this was a fascinating &#34;inside&#34; view of the Skunk Works. It is written from an Engineer's viewpoint and appers to be extremely accurate. The other book, Area 51, was so full of fantasies and outright errors, that it should have marketed as &#34;FIction&#34;.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Great and very intriguing series. I like it even more because it is based on the past. It shows how man can change history and with it religion.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|A great movie, and Daniel Day-Lewis makes Lincoln come alive. I love Civil War films as they describe the battle for the soul of our nation, which continues today
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Not only the best Foreign Film I saw last year - but one of the BEST FILMS I saw last year. A wonderfully uplifting, optimistic, heartfelt story (based on a true story and real people), beautifully acted and written - I loved this film. Walked out of the theater smiling. You will too. The story may sound familiar (a guy with a &#34;past&#34; and some demons of his own becoming the caretaker for a paraplegic in a wheelchair who has the money to afford top notch care, but sees something special in this man who interviews for the job. They bond and grow close and it still winds around some curves where you're not sure of the outcome. Couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD so I could watch it again and share it with family members and friends.
B008602KQI|5.0|Its not as good as the book but i love it and just yesterday i got my Hunger Games merchendice and i love it
B000FA5TTW|5.0|Great book!! I would highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I didn't want it to end. Don't miss this one!
B000MKD9P6|5.0|One of those rare films that I enjoy watching as much as my 12-year-old daughter, but we see slightly different things in it.  Anne Hathaway is great, Meryl Streep is extraordinary as always, and the temptation to go over to the &#34;dark side&#34; is really well played.  I don't think my daughter really understands the epiphany the main character experiences, but she'll get there.  The music, lighting, clothing and settings are appropriately fabulous.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|After two great books, this last one, Requiem, was a disappointment. The story moved slow and the characters didn't have the same feel that they did in the first books. I was bored reading it and felt that the ending a was a major let down. This happen often in series I read, and it makes me leary to read more series in the future.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Good app. Doesn't crash. Makes you use your brain . If brain exercises are what you want this is it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a wonderful series.  I can't wait to see where it goes.  Be sure to start from the beginning so you don't miss any of the story line or characters.  It is so so good.  I plan to buy all of them some day.  Loved it.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|It is very informatative.  Keeps you interested throughout the book.  I would recommend<br />it to people who are interested in how the government works and what our Presidents<br />were thinking when they were President.  I learned that Truman was not the hated man<br />that I was lead to believe.  He was very smart and we owe him a lot.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|The first few minutes into the movie I was very excited to see a new and refreshing version of Anna Karenina. The concept with the stage is so clever. I was truly impressed. Unfortunately half way the movie it starts to become old and the story becomes boring.
B000HKW7E0|4.0|Probably the second best National Lampoon's movie.  Chevy Chase makes this movie for me.  I really like his comeback career with the TV show Community.
B009DKFSUA|5.0|CD contains 15 tracks that goes through 4 to 5 different styles. Featuring great artists like Usher, Akon, JLo, Shakira and CAguilera, I would say this album is &#34;Classy&#34;. Since most of the songs vary from uptempo to the slower chorus, I would call it a &#34;Jam it in the Car&#34; type of CD rather than letting it run during a house party.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|this movie was one of yhe best ever and it should have gooten a better rating. my family really like it
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|Me and my husband enjoyed watching this together years ago and when I saw this I knew that he would truly appreciate me and it would bring back so many memories.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Addictive easy to play for awhile. Pretty neat graphics too. Price was very reasonable, have played this game a lot and it is hard to put down.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|After two amzing seasons, the third season of The walking dead was a little slow to my taste. Hopefully this is a prelude to an amazing fourth season. That is the reason I gave it 4 stars in stead of 3. I am hopeful, because this is one of my favorite shows.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Arrived before the estimated date, as described. Thanks for the expedited service! Will certainly be coming back for more product!
B00BESLT6G|3.0|The plot and the overall way it unfolds is slightly confusing and mostly boring. The only reason I kept watching was because the characters looked incredible.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|a very good movie that my grandson wanted it for christmas, it is full of action.tom cruise has made a lot of great movied
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you haven't watched this show, you are missing out. Watch it from the beginning, you will get hooked. 5 stars all the way.
B009G78EE2|4.0|Killer CD in my book.  Some songs are much better than others but I would consider this a pretty good album.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|The story has been used several times, but I like the twist at the end; certainly didn't expect it. Loved the way the relationship between Katey and Alex was not forced, unfolding naturally and quite charming. If you're looking for a great \\"starting over\\" love story then this book will most certainly satisfy.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love Downton Abbey.  Thank you amazon for making a deal with PBS to offer this on your website.  Everyone must watch this great show.
B004UPANGM|5.0|A classic historical work of art that will shock you all while making you laugh. Highly recommended for all ages ;)
B0014VQGX4|4.0|it was a good present for my nephew. had a hard time finding a good truck that he wanted. But this worked out great. he plays with it all the time.
0670024813|5.0|Jared Diamond uses his extensive scientific expertise in deft combination with his graceful yet simple writing style to convey information about comparative ethnography in a manner that the layperson can readily understand and profit from.  His use of personal stories and anecdotes lends a human side that humanizes what could otherwise be a sometimes dry and difficult subject.  I only wish more authors could blend a genuine and deep understanding of science with a method of conveying information comprehensible to the layman.  I always feel that I have received the benefit of a well-taught college course when I read one of his books.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|This CD is great.  If you are sick of listening to the same old music give it a try.  It's one of the best I've heard in a while.  I can't wait to see them at the House of Blues.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved this thought provoking book! There are so many levels to the story that reading it once was not an option for me.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Funny.  Creative.  Great characters.  The title Awkward fits jenna's life so well but she always perseveres.  This show is always fun to watch. =)
B00B69UQEO|5.0|This album is full of songs that show exactly where Depeche Mode are at in this stage of their lives. I appreciate the fact that they have not succumbed to making a dance album that tries to follow the newer electronic acts. I was pleasantly surprised by David Gahan's use of falsetto in 'Should Be Higher'(first time for falsetto?). It's written by him AND one of the best on the album. The album has great beats, sequences, arps, vocals, and crafted analog synthesis. Everything a true electronic fan can appreciate.
B000FBJF7I|5.0|You'll have to read No.2 in the Ladies' Detective Agency to discover what the tears of the giraffe means.  As the second book you will find that successful people are not always slim and gorgeous, but smart and reasonable.
B0002KVUKW|5.0|This was a movie with a lot of action.  Hugh Jackman and David Wenham were both excellent in this film.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This show is the best, gets better with each new season!!  I actually laugh out loud when I'm watching it:)
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I don't know who enjoys this game on my Kindle more, me or my grandsons.  Very addictive and super fun!
B000I9W08I|5.0|Love the money, Have watched with all my children to introduce them to great movies from different generations. They loved it and wanted more.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This series is beautifully filmed with tremendous sound. I am in the middle of Book 4 and am thoroughly enjoying seeing the characters come alive through this series. Wish I could afford to see more than one a week in order to catch up...but this is good too!
B000FBJF78|5.0|Mma Remamswa sorts out more mysteries than most cops and highly qualified ever do with her reasonably thinking mind.  She takes cases some would throw out as ridiculous.  I hope you have starting at the beginning of the series.  If not I enjoyed reading them again as I just picked out titles I thought looked interesting.  Even then I loved this book as I have all the rest.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it was as advertised,my grandkids love all temple runs.they can play all day.so can i.keep up the good work please
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Using the Amazon Prime free streaming feature was so convenient. I watched the whole season, start to finish, in one day, simply because I could (and it was too addictive to stop!). Highly recommend this show to anyone who likes excellent acting, poignant writing, beautiful visuals, and historical pieces. Excellent show-- I can hardly wait for season 3!
B003YNFYD8|5.0|My son's been asking for this album for a while, so we finally got it for him.  It came quickly and was in perfect condition.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|LOVE this game, a great and fun mix of genres.  tons of stuff to do, easy to learn... basically, all good!! my favorite gameloft game by far.
B00BF11STU|1.0|I will never know if I would like this film or not because of technical difficulties viewing it, such as not knowing an audio extension cable was needed from my computer to the TV where we wanted to watch the film or that our wi-fi Internet connection was going to go down about 20 minutes into the film preventing us from see anymore of it.<br />Next time, I will go to REDBOX, it's half the price and no Internet issues.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|You are not getting 101 games. You are getting not more then a handful, and rather dull games at best.<br />For any subsequent games you are asked to fork over money so you may unlock them.<br /><br />About the games that were free I have to say they were not particularly exciting. The controls are often horrible, as if the game was not designed to work with a touchscreen. I uninstalled this the day after getting it.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Amazon Prime provides it for free, which is the best.<br /><br />Those who are interested can also consider watching Battle Royale (available in Netflix).
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|I will have to return, as I find I already have one which I purchased in order to recharge my Kindles. Sales literature was not explicit .
B00003CX95|5.0|I LOVE AMAZON, FOR MAKING ALOT<br />OF PRODUCTS AVAILABLE.  I BOUGHT<br />THIS BRAVEHEART DVD. IT CAME IN<br />EXCELLANT SHAPE, AND WORKS GREAT.<br />I WAS RELUCTANT TO BUY USED, BUT<br />THE DVD IS WELL DESCRIBED, AND PLAYS<br />LIKE NEW.  -SO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND<br />THIS DVD, OR ANY OF THE DVD'S AMAZON<br />SELLS.  -I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The is just an amazing game who ever came up with this is a genius although its kind of like temple run so pretty much the point is that people should get this game
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I think this is a great game for the price. Keeps me entertained for a few minutes, with different levels of playing skill.
B000EUDAWG|2.0|product is too noisey and does poorly on tile or laminiate flooring. i wouldn't buy this product again. poorly responsive to remote.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|great, fantastic it's a fantastic book..!!!!! it was beyond my expectations without a doubt, I would reallly recommend this book<br />to anyone, it's a great piece
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Lincoln voted against rights for freed slaves in Illinois.  He was not the champion of equality they make him out to be.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Anyone who enjoys the thrills of action adventure flicks should enjoy this film.  The story line is good along with the high tech gadgets and stunts.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I just watched this on a friends recommendation and I loved it. Great story, great characters, just good old fashioned storytelling.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I enjoyed it! Good costumes--very futuristic makeup.  And as for plot--finally a new idea! Decent cinematography, also. Streaming quality was very goog
B0017SWSCW|5.0|This book was another Archer page turner.  When I want to escape I pick up an Archer book to immerse myself in.
B001S86J1C|5.0|great, fantastic it's a fantastic book..!!!!! it was beyond my expectations without a doubt, I would reallly recommend this book<br />to anyone, it's a great piece
0345803493|5.0|Book arrived as expected in excellent condition. No complaints. Would order another. Great addition to my collection. Can't wait to order the final book.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|The family loves the game but it took quite a while to figure out how to play it. The instructions that come with the game aren't as clear as they should be but after visiting the webpage - hyperlink on instructions - we figured it out.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|It's the Doctor, so it is awesome. Matt Smith does a wonderful job of capturing this character. After watching this I had to go back and catch up on every Doctor Who episode ever made. It's brilliant
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My kindle was not functioning well.  This new cord, and the charger that I received are excellent.  And my kindle seems to be working great at this time.  And I like that it is longer than most charger cords, I can actually keep it on top of a table when charging without extension cords.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|If you have a slightly warped sense of humor, you will probably like this movie. It has quite a few &#34;moments&#34;.
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|great, fantastic it's a fantastic book..!!!!! it was beyond my expectations without a doubt, I would reallly recommend this book<br />to anyone, it's a great piece
B000J103OI|5.0|The Devil Wears Prada is a devilishly funny film. Luckily I got to see this at the theatre. Fine support comes from Anne Hathaway dealing with the boss from hell.
0375869026|5.0|We originally bought this for our 10-year old and he loved it. My wife is reading it now and I am patiently waiting for my turn. I cheated a little and read a few pages when no one was looking and was immediately pulled in.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love how every episode leaves you on the edge of your seat anticipating the next one! BRAVO!<br />And for the record I do not watch a lot of series, nor am I a huge believer in the &#34;zombie apocalypse&#34;.
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|I like it, to start, at least.  However I feel like I cannot move forward after puzzles are completed and I can't figure out why.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|The movie was visually stunning. if you want to see a lot of great graphics and a great story told through word pictures this movie is for you.<br /><br />If you are Atheist or any other type of anti-god person move along. The whole movie is basically about this one boys faith and how god sees his life story. I am a person of faith and the movie still kind of bothered me because i don't agree with the views there in.
B008ALA6DW|4.0|it works fine, no disappointment.  no more commons, need 12 more words before i can submit this resposes dont know
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Viola Davis is wonderful in The Help. And was nominated for an Academy Award for this role. Luckily I saw this at the theatre. The whole cast provides great support. Highly reccommended.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I enjoyed the first book of this series. I got into game of thrones through watching the first two episodes of the job series, an  I have to admit I prefer the book to the series.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I LOVE this show and it is great that I can watch it on Amazon video one day after it aired-good video quality!
B009VSW15Y|1.0|I only give it one star because it appears useless for my Kindle Fire HD. I would not recommend it to anyone.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I great up on the old Bond movies, so i really dig the throw back to the old format. The acting, story telling and visuals in the movie are great.<br /><br />Guns, cars, women and of course explosions.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Life of Pi is a wonderful film. I have shown it to several people and each one has enjoyed it immensely.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I loved this film ! Sandra Bullock is as good as she has ever been. True story of a family who takes in a homeless football player. Truly touching. Great support is provided by the wonderful Kathy Bates.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show!! My husband and I started watching the show when it first came on... We love it... My 14 year old son even started watching it w us, and he loves it!! Definitely a must see show!! Watch all episodes from season 1 to season 3!! Can't wait till new episodes returns in October...
B00BF11UM0|5.0|Really enjoyed the fact the movie was about all the work and effort in finding MBL and not about senior administration in Washington patting themselves on the back for the end result of work they didn't do.
B004X75RK4|5.0|I enjoyed this movie from start to finish it was very heartwarming, inspirational and I will watch it a bunch more times and will recommend it to all my friends.
B00B2DSIAI|4.0|This movie makes a fun throw back for any old-school gamer and for new alike. i really enjoyed seeing some of the more obscure characters from games i played as a kid. Good story good, voice acting, good graphics. No magic, if it matters to you, which is rare for the &#34;Magical&#34; kingdom of Disney.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I loved this book and highly recommend it .  I was sad when it was finished . What a wonderful story .
B0042816YK|5.0|Eat Pray Love is a voyage of discovery for a woman figuring out her life. Viola Davis provides wonderful support along with James Franco. Helps you see other cultures and stretch your mind.
B002PWB7C6|5.0|I am a fan of both Jamie Foxx and Colin Ferrell. I also  LOVED the TV show in the mid 80's.
B0058O84G0|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, I liked the historical aspect as well and the balance between the families etc. I especially liked the development of some of the characters
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|It is okay but I have only played a few times so I have not really caught on to it yet
B008602KQI|2.0|Too predictable.Bad acting and the premise is just bad.Also noit enough detail about how the society turned so dysfunctional.A telling statement of the haves and have nots though.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|As far as a Peter Jackson film goes, you will not be dissapointed. When it comes to LOTR standards, this is sub-par. I think that you do not develop much of an understanding of the characters. For me, I thought Bilbo was more clever and cunning in the book than they portray him in the film. The movie is pretty funny at times, but they contradict this with the &#34;seriousness&#34; of the content.The set was beautiful as expected, and overall very entertaining.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|Sex And The City 2 is funny with Kim Cattrall again. For fans of the series only. Others might not be able to take it. Luckily I got to see this in the theatre. Great support is provided by Liza Minelli and the very funny Mario Cantone.
0374214913|5.0|A Book Lover's Romp!<br />Intriguing,mysterious and humourous! ENJOYABLE. Read this book in 2 days. I just enjoyed this book. I'm not into techno themes at all, but even that was enjoyable to read about. This was DaVinci Code meets Big Bang Theory (tv) meets Harry Potter! Fun read! This has to be the \\"coolest\\" book I've ever read.<br /><br />SPOLIER ALERT:<br /><br />While I was reading this book,I kept looking at the cover,it intrigued me, I thought maybe there was a code there too. Never did find anything other than a repeat of the pattern of books. I had this book on my table and getting ready to return it to the library. I turned the tv off and then the lights and there was the fun! The books on the cover glow in the dark!\\"
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Love this show! Came in great condition and on time as promised. So glad to get it I could watch this show over and over again. Thanks for the timely delivery.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I really enjoyed the book because it held me interest despite the subject matter. It captured the OCD of the main character. You were drawn in to her character.
B007SGM084|4.0|I was reluctant, but had to read this to see what all the hype was about.  Underneath all of the trumped up sex talk there was actually a good storyline.
B00000J0O2|5.0|Worked as advertised, great Ink lasts forever. Laser is better than Ink jet any day of the week, for sure.
B004SIP71M|5.0|Doubt is a must see ! Meryl Streep many times is the whole show. Not in this film. The intense scene she shares with oscar nominated Viola Davis has to be seen to be believed. Davis truly takes the scene from Streep. This scene rings with truth ! Able support is provided by Amy Adams and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Luckily I got to see this at the theatre. Very highly reccommended.
0061537969|5.0|One of the best books I have read. It made me laugh and cry.<br />Would make a wonderful gift. I couldn't put it down.
B000FC10WU|5.0|You can never go wrong picking up one of her stories. The old gal was positively murderous and this story is no exception.
B007N85POS|5.0|I loved the movie &#34;Rio&#34;...and this game takes you to Rio with cute Samba music and dancing birds.  The first level is easy, as you help free the kidnapped birds from their cages.  The next levels become more of a challenge with &#34;bad&#34; monkeys taunting you and scrambling back onto their tree branches if they are not directly zapped.  I am not a great gamer... but this is so cute that I still enjoy it and can play it with my grandkids.  PLUS, it was FREE!<br />There ARE tools you can actually pay for and buy to enhance your abilities (like dynamite, a Samba bird, a scope, etc), which are also given to you as an occasional bonus.  But you can still play without them.
B00AOOIIVA|5.0|This movie was extremely cute and funny! I love the &#34;take&#34; on the old Frankenstein monster stories, and I just love Tim Burton! Definitely a movie for all ages!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|So funny and witty. Highly recommend. Tina is a genius.<br />She can do no wrong. I have heard great things about this book and didn't doubt  it for a second.
B002RSDW80|5.0|Julie & Julia is a great film. Luckily I saw this in the theatre. Really seems to tell a truthful story of Julia Child. Amy Adams provides able support.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Love the movie! Kept you on the chair for the entire movie. But Ben Affleck should also get the best actor award. What is the academy thinking?
B007X4ECMI|5.0|Love this movie although it does remind me of escape from New York.  Lots of action.  Guy Pearce did a great job.
B008ASGP3U|2.0|Too much time spent describing the countryside .<br />Thought I was reading a tourist guide much of the time.<br />A good plot spoiled!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Watching the characters grow and learn to trust each other and find a common bond with the children made the story grow and become a solid relationship after being tested with her ex husband confronting her and the kids.  Also the added surprise of his late wife added a spiritual component that added more depth to the story.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|addicting game. can't put it down. I can even play it on my kindle fire. Play this more than any other game
B001DDBCUA|5.0|Sex In The City is a wild film that fans of the series will appreciate most. Luckily I saw this at the theatre. Kim Cattrall draws the most attention. Fine support is given by Jennifer Hudson.
B008220D5K|5.0|I think this movie was hilarious and will definitely watch it more than once.  I think this is probably Paul Rudd's funniest role in any movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like the look of this version so much better than the other apps that the ads are bearable. I like the cards to look real and not all like aces. It would be nice if they had a paid version without ads...maybe someday.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Cute game. However there seems to be quite a few bugs. Does not give credit for free gems, no credit for mini groom games and worst of all got to level 49 and lost everything. Money, gems and horses. After saying that still need some other tasks always waiting for energy to build or there is nothing else to do but wait or visit a friend. After completing compitions not much else to do. Some items it takes a long time to get enough money or gems to purchase. Overall fun game  just fix the freeze ups, crashes and loosing items that you have worked so hard to get.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is a very good show and I wouldn't miss it. As each season go by, it gets better and better.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|A fun movie to watch.  Generally good acting and nice story.  Don't expect too deep a message, just a relaxing view.
B002VECLVO|5.0|A Single Man is a special film. So well acted by Colin Firth and Julianne More. Not for children but open minded adults can appreciate it. Highly reccommended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Can't seem to put this game down, this game is so exciting and wonderful I reackamind this to everone you will not be able to put it down hour's of fun fun.
B00AZNEW5G|3.0|Just watched Zero Dark Thirty on PPV. Still trying to process whether or not I liked it. Leaning towards the \\"meh\\" category I think. The way the trailers and promo were pushed made it seem much more action based than it was. There was also a lot of rushed dialog that with all the Middle-eastern names being thrown out at 100mph, if you didn't have the close captioning turning on you would have totally missed big portions of connections between the people they were hunting for. I also hated that they didn't really explain (through either exposition or screen title) who all the different guys in suits were supposed to be in those big meetings. We got the message that Gandalfini was a big boss - but he was supposed to be Leon Panetta who he looks nothing like, how were we to know? Overall it was good, just not fantastic. Black Hawk Down still takes the #1 spot for my favorite modern warfare movie.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book provided an in-depth realistic first hand account of the missions undertaken by Seal Team 6.  The book was gripping, dramatic and I believe honest.
B00BI745AA|5.0|Haunting.  On my mind for several days.  Characters were amazing (all).  Most surprised and pleased with Russell Crowe.  May need to watch again soon.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is not for children, but open minded adults can appreciate it. Very fine acting by all with a  special nod to Anne Hathaway.Luckily I got to see this at the theatre.  A love story once seen never forgotten. Highly reccommended.
1616550414|5.0|Great product, bought it for my son who is a huge Zelda fan.  A good quality product with vibrant images and good factual content. a must for any fan.  I also must comment on the fantastic Amazon service.  I live in the UK and it took just 6 days from ordering to receiving this product.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is a giant time waster but fun and is very difficult to cheat with, cannot pick up stacks and see what is underneath, other than that is fun
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|I am 21 years old and I loved this movie.  It was filled with humor for all ages and if you like video games you will appreciate this movie.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Washington did such a job of portraying the character.  Interesting concept of the hydraulic issue. Reconciliation process with son golden.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the premise and the two different points of view but was so  very disappointed in the ending.......still worth a read.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|My wife really enjoys to play this game. The music is good and the game is challenging but not impossible.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I SAY THAT IT IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!  .MAKE IT 100DOLLARS AND IT WOULD STILL BE WORTH BUYING IT!!!!!!!
B000W93CHC|5.0|This is an excellent book.  Very long--very, easy to read!!  Especially on a Kindle where it is so easy to get a definition for olde English words!!  The author is amazing in transitioning and keeping the characters alive.  Am ready the century trilogy now.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|I was really excited for this movie.  About half way through it I realized that it was just going to be a series of intense action scenes spliced together.  They could have done sooo much more with the plot but they decided to focus on action scenes.  Definitely not my favorite Bond movie.
B0042MEQVG|3.0|Yadda-yadda-yadda, just more of the same tedious flirtations that of course lead nowhere.<br />The opening sequence is indicative of where this series falls apart......as once again we are maltreated to the same nonproductive argument that is neither cute nor particularly interesting.<br />\\"Marry me.\\"<br />\\"Marry me.\\"<br />\\"Change me.\\"<br />\\"Marry me.\\"<br />\\"Marry me.\\"<br />Literally, that was the extent of their scintillating conversation.<br />Worse, instead of moving the story forward, they're stuck in time, battling flashbacks and old history with that persistent vamp Victoria (sad to say, I didn't even notice that Bryce Dallas Howard had taken over the role from Rachelle LeFevre).  Her time on screen barely allowed her to stand out (although she was given a bit more to do this time than just running/zipping through a forest being chased by every brother and his dog).<br />At this point, even the supposed triangle is nothing more than a foregone conclusion.  Trying to jazz up the competition at this late stage is nothing more than a show of desperation.  I'd say it was perfectly obvious that Bella only has (shark) eyes for Edward.  Why bother with the pretense?  Even when the boys were snarling as they verbally fought over that vapid idiot, Kristen Stewart just stood there all dead around the eyes, incapable of delivering one shred of emotion.  She has no expression other than one of extreme monotony.  Flat as a cardboard cutout, it's a pity such an essential role was wasted on an actress who clearly cannot act.<br />If it wasn't for the fantastic battle sequence, I'd say this movie was a total waste of time.<br /><br />What hurts this series the most was the miscasting of Kristen Stewart.  I still cannot believe/accept that all these people are willing to die for that empty-headed ninny.  She clearly doesn't have what it takes to inspire that much devotion.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was hooked with each book of this trilogy.  I couldn't stop reading.  Who knew a book written for teenagers could be so compelling.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I tried to access my Email via this app and could not. I have gone back to the regular web access. Not all of the special characters work for logging in or password on the app.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Could not stop reading.  Never wanted to put it down even for one minute. Can't wait to read the next one in the series.
B00A2YBDTQ|5.0|love this mel brooks movie- thank you amazon prime -convenient to be able to watch any time i want. thanks
B0035XVVDY|3.0|Typical and predictable Hollywood \\"thriller\\". It's fine to see once, but nothing to write home about. Butler and Foxx are capable of so much better.
B007H1HQW0|5.0|Shipped out quickly and works great just need to practice to get good cuts but the product itself is super easy to use.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was hooked with each book of this trilogy.  I couldn't stop reading.  Who knew a book written for teenagers could be so compelling.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|A classic.  Purchased it for my son and he loved it.  It's a good book to have your children read, I remember I had to read it in school also.  Keep them away from the video games and give them classics!
B009UX2YAC|2.0|At first when I got the app, It was grate! The characters, how it was. Everything. But a month or two later, there were these pop up add that kept on saying &quot;Upgrade the app.&quot; And it showed Sub way suffers Sydney. I thought It would be cool, and better than the first one. But I was so wrong! When it finished uploading, I got on it Wright away. Then It kept on freezing and then I kept loosing the game. Then it didn't work. I was pretty upset.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|We laughed and enjoyed feeling quite better off than this couple but could relate just the same. Love the actors and seeing the girls growing up.
B005FHXB0O|5.0|One of the truly best ensemble pieces of all times. The cast is astounding.  And, It was written by Quentin Tarrantino.  Just IMDB the cast and know that everyone of them gave a stellar performance.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I've given copies of this book to so many diverse people...  In The Way of Kings, Sanderson creates the most incredible and original world, and then weaves a story through it that is absolutely captivating and exciting.  I love that I can heartily recommend it to a 55-year-old friend going on vacation and then to a 14-year-old boy looking for a good summer read...and have them both come back to me saying they thoroughly loved it!  Sanderson's writing is all about character development, fantasy magic, plot twists, battles, humor, evil, heartache, romance, and incredible action, all of epic magnitude...without succumbing to the belief of many fantasy authors that a &#34;good&#34; book has to include graphic sex scenes. His Mistborn series is the same way. Thank you, thank you, Brandon Sanderson, for writing books that epitomize &#34;escape fiction&#34; and create followers who repeatedly count down the days until the next book in the series is released with great anticipation!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|What a story and so well written.  I can't wait for Lisa Genova to write another book.  Her research is impeccable and so knowledgeable.
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|Cant really say much about the movie as I did not get a chance to see all of it, The down load quite twice even though I have high sped internet. It was very slow to down load and impossible to watch with video streaming.  What I did see of the move didn't look realistic to me. seemed to much to be staged and poorly done.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I can now enjoy Kindle books on my android tablet. My reading possibilities have now expanded. A must for any android user.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|First book I have purchased in years that I have no desire to finish. I gave it my best over half way thru, keep thinking it will improve. NOT!
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Of the three nominees that I saw, I thought Lincoln and Argo were not as strong as Silver Linings Playbook. My favorite president, but not my favorite movie.  Spielberg has a way of preaching that I find off-putting.I walked out of the theatre at the ends of both Private Ryan and Schindler's List, wishing Stephen could have just ended the movie at the end.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great book.  Pat's character is so endearing in his optimism.  Although the subject matter is heavy and at times you want to snap him into reality, it's still a great story and you're really invested in Pat's success.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hooked with this first book of this trilogy.  I couldn't stop reading.  Who knew a book written for teenagers could be so compelling.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like this game. I always liked to play games. I don't have any one to play with in person,
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Incredible computerized digital animation that appears so real - well done. New young lead actor is awesome to say the least.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Didn't care for his reactions to a lot of issues.<br />He is like an errant child. And extremely overbearing. I'm not sure why she stays with him, great sex aside.
B00B23O96A|5.0|One of the world's greatest guitar players plays an easy going set of tunes with old friends.  There is happiness and the joy of music on this disc, and I send a smiley face thank you  to the&#34;simple man&#34; for sharing it with us. That is how he refers to himself on his promo interviews that he did for Guitar Center. He really seems to believe that that he is just a simple man with an exceptional gift.  Amen to that, Eric.
B00005N6KG|3.0|I really liked these, but they didn't last more than a few months before one ear stopped working. They don't stay in ear too well either, but the sound is pretty okay. They were pretty comfortable though. All in all there are probably better headphones for the price on this site.
B00005NUZM|5.0|wonderful music I would listen to it all day long, very happily anytime at all,seriously anytime day or night love it
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|fantastic, futuristic view of what happens when human society puts its blood lust into a futuristic arena, like the ancient romans did with gladiators. given the content of teens murdering each other the pg-13 rating seems a little low.
1594136440|5.0|This book really helps you to feel the emotions of the people living during<br />the late 1700's in the southern states where slavery was common on the<br />farms and plantations.  Love does not recognize the color of your skin.
B0053TMP24|4.0|Great going back to the Percy Jackson stories.  I started reading them to keep us with kids at my church.  It's a great way to understand mythology.  So far, I think I prefer the first series but it'll be interesting to see how the original characters come back into play
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is written from the perspective of the mentally ill person. It includes the confussion just during (after care), and his journey back to a more stable condition. It addresses medication , personal interaction, family dynamics. I am a patient. This book is accurate, all wrapped up in a love story. Thank you Matthew Quick.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie has a truly sad concept but it is almost believable with how dark sportsmanship and politics are going. Makes you glad we haven't gotten this bad yet but dread the thought of it's possibility.<br /><br />The cast and performance to me were spot on, especially Jennifer Lawrence, only adding to this film believability. Not sure why this bad ass tom boy act works so well for her just as it did in 'Winter's Bone' but I have to say, she is seriously attractive in this role.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next in the saga. Hope it's as good!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|all was not liked, very much not fun , I was not liking this game, not good for the game
B000L53D4O|4.0|Purchased for grandson who is pulling up on things and trying to walk. Easy to assemble, really right out of the box you snap legs to secure in up right position, put stickers on, and bingo your done.  He loved it and pushed/walked with it for hours. He wanted to play with the objects on the front while walking and would stumble, but he enjoyed it.  Very light weight plastic, works well on smooth surface, not real well on gravel (our driveway is gravel), causing him to try to push harder.  Good product.
B0000A5A0T|5.0|Great CD, the music is great, and great deliver too, the deal is great and the service is great, I just love it. It is fantastic
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The series certainly holds your attention.  The characters are great and the relationships between the gentry and staff are wonderful to see develop.  Highly recommend it.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This is a book well written. Suspense is great, hard to put down but can't wait to pick up and start reading.<br />One of the most outstanding features no obscene language. A writer who knows how to write. One other thing the people were real<br />no stupid sex writing. This was the first book I read from this Arthur it will not be the last. I bought two more books from this Arthur and have not been dis pointed. Thank you sir for putting the  reader first.
B000VRH0T6|5.0|I love this album...!!! I always have to listen to it as I go skiing for the first time each year...  It never gets old.
B0043RGXJS|5.0|any music of his is wonderful anytime of the day he is really wonderful at all times of the day
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We are enjoying the ongoing antics of the whole Crawley family and their staff. There are more than enough complications to keep any fan of sagas awake for the whole series. Try to guess the next turn or twist in the story and you are almost always wrong! Keep the intrigue going. We can hardly wait.
B00B23O96A|5.0|Great CD, the music is great, and great deliver too, the deal is great and the service is great, I just love it. It is fantastic
B005NFW0U0|5.0|I cannot stand the thought of Damon being with anyone else, and I wish Caroline would just get with Klaus already!
B00746O3X8|5.0|This is a great product!  I was on a tour last fall in which another participant had one (not sure what brand, and more about that later), so dropped a few hints when I got home and got one from my family for Christmas (via Amazon).<br /><br />A lot has been said in other reviews about the features, pro and con, so won't repeat any of that here, other than to say that I pretty much agree with all the pros, which far outweigh the cons.  The only real \\"negative\\" for me was the single one-third of a sheet of rough hand sketches laughingly called an \\"Instruction Manual\\", which was essentially useless.  If you do order one (which I strongly recommend), plan on learning about it instead by reading all these reviews and by \\"OJT\\" experience, which is perhaps the most effective method anyway.<br /><br />I've just returned from a two-week cruise/tour of the Panama Canal and Central America, where I used it extensively every day (which was its first use and \\"baptism by fire\\").  I'll just touch on a couple of things that others haven't much mentioned.<br /><br />One is what use you make of the second (side) holster.  Most people that mentioned that seemed to focus (no pun intended) on using it for a second DSLR or maybe just a second lens for the main DSLR body, as well as maybe detaching it for separte use elsewhere.  I like my somewhat outdated DSLR both for the eye level viewfinder but also because it's relatively light and compact, since, unlike most newer ones, it doesn't have a \\"full featured\\" built in video capability.  But, while I don't shoot that much video, I like to have the capability available for when an appropriate situation unexpectedly presents itself.  So, I used the front holster for my DSLR with 18-200mm lens and the side holster for a \\"stand alone\\" HD video camera, which turned out to be a very useful combination because it allowed for almost instantaneous switching between the two cameras.<br /><br />On the subject of the safety straps; the guy I mentioned whom I had seen using one of these last year had an unfortunate experience which showed the value of remembering to use the straps.  He was doing the samething I now do (i.e., using it to carry DSLR and video cameras).  We were shooting from an open rail car on an excursion steam train through the Rockies and he accidently dropped the video camera over the side.  Unfortunately, he had neglected to connect the safety strap.  The good news was, he did eventually get what was left of the camera back after some workmen found it and brought it to the next station.  So, although the camera itself was pretty much totaled, he at least got all his photos back.  But, it was a valuable lesson to me to always make sure the straps are attached.  And, that paid off on my recent trip when I dropped the video camera a couple of times in precarious places and the strap saved it both times.  I think this was a \\"learning curve\\" thing because I was used to having the cameras on neck straps and so had a habit of letting go of them momentarily to free my hands for other things.<br /><br />Finally, I almost dropped my rating to 4 stars because of the issue some others have mentioned about not being able to use a tripod or monopod when you have the holster knobs installed on the cameras.  I decided against doing so because, as I mentioned before, the main benefit of this system to me (besides relieving neck strain)was that it enables you to switch quickly between cameras as the situation requires.  Since tripod and even monopod shots are by nature not really \\"quick reaction\\" situations, I decided that this limitation didn't really warrant a downgrade.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Originally, I started The Good Wife towards end of Season 1. I was glad to watch it through. I didn't think the reviewing at the beginning was always necessary but for cases helped.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|This soon-to-be classic ties in an incredible ensemble, excellent directing, beautiful cinematography, a memorable context and an impressionable story.<br /><br />All content aside, my rating is derived from the film's re-watchability (you're considering buying the DVD). I looped this movie over and over and have never felt the retrospective plot become trite and stale. Fresh and exciting every time. Especially in stunning 1080p!
B007SGM084|5.0|I am only half way through the first book, things are getting steamy......christian grey is a mystery and sexy ohh la la
B002BPQ0Y2|5.0|This is my theme music. I feel like I have a happy strut when I walk down the street. I feel like dancing when I listen to the beat. Awesome, amazing.....
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book keeps you on your toes at all times I recommend this book for everyone! I'm so addicted to this series and the movies.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Simple and Beautiful. I couldn't stop reading it.<br />The book is written in a simple way, but with a lot of interesting ideas.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Absoutely the BEST show on tv!  Can't wait to see what happens in Season 4!  Keep up the good work!
B0019R6XD6|5.0|Musically, a great first album. Lyrically it mostly seems immature/teenage-ish. Fast Taker talks about being with a 16-yea-old girl... I like the 2nd side better, for the sheer epicness! I could cut this album in half, just give me the 2nd side and I would still pay full price!
B007M45PMU|3.0|I had heard the song 'Ho Hey' in an advertisement, and I was really impressed by it. So, I found it on Amazon mp3 and thought I would like The Lumineers music. I do to some extent. A lot of the songs sound the same, but they still pull me in with their straightforward, simple lyrics.
1451695187|2.0|Other than seeing (meeting) people who had previously died, he really didn't offer anything substantive about &#34;heaven.&#34; Or, his perception of heaven is a lot different than mine. Shining lights and an angel are not my idea of heaven. As a doctor, I think he only proved that the mind has the ability to continue on even when at its weakest, creating images that can be remembered when one returnes to consciousness. Since he never actually died, but was only very near to death, his claim is not very valid.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Liked the story line. The ending was a bit &#34;up in the air&#34;. A reasonable depiction of high functioning autism.
B000V8A95C|5.0|One of the best musicals of all time. Superb music, lyrics and performances! Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth are magic
B002DQFHKM|4.0|Gotta love having songs by Devo, Stevie Nicks, etc., on an album called &#34;Heavy Metal&#34; but seriously, there are several great songs here, INCLUDING Devo's &#34;Working in a Coal Mine&#34;, BOC's &#34;Veteran of the Psychic Wars&#34;, and the title track by Sammy Hagar
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Vintage Preston-Child. Fast paced and thought provoking. As always,I am already looking forward to the next Pendergast thrilling epic novel
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Great movie! Touches your heart...Actors are doing remarkable job. And Director is great, as well. Highly recommend! Order and see it online.
B005HF0GMA|5.0|Twists and turns abound in each episode. Allison's dreams allow for creative use of storytelling. It's like looking at puzzle peices and watching it fit togther by the end, trying to guess which end is up.
006016848X|5.0|If your looking to enrich your relationships- this book is right for anyone with enough intelligence to make the effort to work on their relationships. If you want to get the most love out of your life, it's worth your while to get a hold of this book. At least in my book, its a MUST READ.
B0054XOMX4|5.0|Purchased from GoodGreenTea received Korean version instead of Japanese.  It's genuine from Takara Tomy SonoKong and quality is par to Japanese version. Spin for a good 6 minutes and beat my nephew's Japanese Diablo Nemesis 4D with normal rip launcher. Kind of mis-advertising but still good buy.
B008Q0D9DG|5.0|I love this movie, I've watched it in the spring every year since I was a kid.  I've owned it on VHS and DVD previously.  When I saw it on Amazon Video I was happy to watch it in the new medium without having to dust off the DVD.
1468179993|4.0|How To Deliver A TED Talk: Secrets Of The World's Most Inspiring Presentations\\" is a complete public speaking guide for creating presentations that inspire others through your story. Yes, don't think you don't have an idea worth spreading. But, don't try to tell your complete life in that 18 minutes slot, think audience-centric, focus on the lesson or takeway for them, and then work backwards. Donovan studied a lot of  popular TEDTalks (which are on Youtube for your entertainment and learning experience) and provides this step-by-step playbook to help you deliver a TEDTalk yourself or any other effective presentation.<br />The author pays attention to the selection of the topic, a attractive title, the structure (opening, body, closing), but also additional, but essential success factors, like the use of humor, your body language, slides (if any), images, pace and the need to practice. Donovan doesn't forget to start off with the 10 commandments for every TED speaker and the importance of the introduction by the emcee or host. He frequently points you to great TEDTalks to show you how the  world's most inspiring presentation are being delivered. This book is a great learning resource, for both aspiring presenters as well as experienced ones still open for correction and improvement.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My niece talked me in to downloading this game and I had a blast. It took me a while to get the hang of it but I really enjoy playing this game. Every1 should try this games, you'll love it and it's addictive.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Great story, well told. Looking forward to reading more from this author. A story that makes you stop and think.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Loved the soundtrack, and it was super funny.  Eveny my boyfriend enjoyed it and he doesn't usually like &#34;chick flicks&#34;  This is great for ALL!
B0012QRPU4|5.0|its surprising, it's a  good story, i  will want to watch some more.  i'm sorry it's ending deserves five stars
1449410243|5.0|I don't usually purchase books of this type but I've been following The Oatmeal website for a while and bought both this one and 5 Very Good Reasons to Punch a Dolphin in the Mouth on impulse at target recently. They are very clever and amusing, my entire family has been enjoying them. I highly recommend not only buying both books but checking out the website as well.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Great movie and historically accurate. I would watch this again. It has some very gruesome parts. It's worth the 2+ hours to watch.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Pros:<br />-Bass Boost<br />-Feels like nothing is on your head<br />-Very light<br />-Long Cable<br />-Folds<br />-Looks Expensive(:<br />Cons:<br />-At this point, nothing! (;<br /><br />MUST BUY!
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|It was fun to watch in HD, great story.  Not quite as good as LOTR, but we are looking forward to the next in the series.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Quell games are challenging but fun and relaxing. They have links to their site for solutions if you gt in a jam. I know because I've had to use it on several occasions. They look too hard to solve, but in reality, you just need to step back and think it through.
B0062OCNAI|4.0|I really enjoy Lupton's tone and character development.  It was an unusual type of thriller, but kept me engaged through the entire book.  Well worth the read!
B006BDHAX0|2.0|After a few games it becomes very boring.  The same white tiles in different positions.  Needs more creative designs, backgrounds, colors to become interesting.  Also game will occasionally freeze up.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|We all play it included my wife - my 6 year son love it lots of fun for a simple game and you can upgrade the car and the driver as you get points :)
0446691437|4.0|Broken down in a similar manner to the Art of War, the War on Art applies Sun Tzu's principles of war to art making.  The idea being that creating art is somewhat of a battle, either between outside elements or internal struggles.  Some good info, kind of an interesting take on executing ideas.  I found it useful if for nothing else but changing my point of view on the whole process of making art.
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|I really like the game but it's too hard to play and get any where. I wish there were games that weren't so hard.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Don't bother with this book no matter how inexpensive it is.  It is a waste of time.  Very poorly written.  Barely edited.  Repetitive. Prosaic. I didn't like a single thing about the book and wouldn't read another book by this author if you paid me.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|I can watch this over and over and it never gets old.  And to think Kevin Costner turned down the role of Andy!
1449433251|5.0|This is an awesome collection and it is definitely worth the price if you are a calvin and hobbes fan! I got it as a present for my mother, she was very surprised, and thoroughly  enjoyed it!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Just what I wanted! Came in a small package. 3 DVD's in Blu-ray!<br /><br />The only way to watch the God father series!
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|Fun game. Gets tricky rather quickly. You need to pay attention. There are short cuts & you don't have to get everything on the screen to advance. You don't need a perfect score to move ahead, unless you want it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Totally not what I expected. I found this book reminding me of what that spark is between two people who love each other or feel passion between each other. I love this book.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|these new birds want to take control of your tablet. in fact most apps now want to take control of ones system. by the message i recive when i want to download these apps.
1476733953|1.0|It is hard to describe just how fantastic this book is.  Consider the craftiness of the silos.  They mine, they drill, yet they never cross mine tunnels even though they are in walking distance of each other.  They have been mining within a stone's throw of each other for centuries yet have stayed out of each other's way.<br />What else?  Well (*** spoiler ***)<br />A great country pulled the trigger on the world to save itself from irrellevance.  What country is this?  China!  (one thinks) but wait.  The characters don't have names like Chin and Wang.  They are Bernard and Juliette and Holston and well, sounds Anglocentric to me.  It's an evil America novel but you don't learn that until 3/4 of the way through.  Doesn't the author realize that America is good now? (It's not the 80s anymore).  But then, that's the magic of Sci-Fi.  Alternate reality is in play.  It was probably Ronald (Wilson) Reagan and Maggie Thatcher that set this whole silo thing up and Al Gore was never elected president in this universe.....
B000IZ3OYQ|5.0|Got this just because I like Mad Max movies - why because I do.  If you do not like these movies don't buy them.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Just like the games we started playing years ago. It's fun to play games like them again just to relax and look back. We sure have come a long way.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Wasn't sure about this game but glad I loaded it. It is almost like playing chess. You have to make the moves in your mind a couple of moves ahead. If you want a game to challenge you this the game is for you. I love the music in the background is so soothing.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I h<br />Watch<br />Bend the prisoner of Damages and I can vBulletin to go in english and Spanish language of war
030758836X|3.0|I, who like mysteries and action novels, found this a tedious story, not my style.  At least the surprise ending was good. Enough said.
B000H2R71G|5.0|Just a fan of the Mad Max movies.  The movies are old but I still like the movies just because I do.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really like this dozer game. It's relaxing yet a challenge at the same time. It's fun to play along with their Holiday dozer game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! Its fun and supremely addicting. I just unlocked tagbot and Lucy. This is so fun! I love this!
B0091VTISO|3.0|Fun and entertaining. good thought put into it. Scary, somewhat, mainly entertaining. Could not stop watching, ended good. I could live without watching it, but it passes time. Good for Prime.BOOBS.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Can hardly wait for season 4; the ending of the 3rd was a real cliffhanger; it left my friends and me stunned.  The characters are so real that they are just part of our family, both upstairs and downstairs.
B00136NUG6|3.0|I had this on vinyl years ago - of course it got trashed from scratches, etc., in college.  Nice to have this again.
B0064QNS62|5.0|I love playing games like this. The games we all started on. Though this is a bit tougher, I still like it. Give it a try, I think you'l like it too.

B007OUINLC|2.0|A Dangerous Method, written by Christopher Hampton and directed by David Cronenberg, is the story of the relationship between the founding intellects of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud (played by Viggo Mortensen replete with prosthetic nose) and Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender), and their relationship with their patient, student, and fellow analyst Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightly).<br /><br />Almost thirty years after the techno-surrealist, sadomasochistic stylings of Cronenberg's  Videodrome, the restraint of A Dangerous Method is often boringly neurotic instead of excruciatingly grotesque. And yet, the film immediately causes intense, almost physical discomfort in the viewer--Knightley's over-acted contortions hardly capture the grotesque contortions of the hysteric, but certainly induce uneasiness. The hyper-confessional mode of the \\"talking cure\\" itself is an uncomfortable one--most of the plot development is encased in diagnostic dialogue and dream interpretation.<br /><br />According to the film's description, Jung and Freud supposedly \\"fall under [the unbalanced yet beautiful] Sabina's spell.\\" Spielrein is portrayed as \\"systematically planning\\" the seduction of Carl Jung, and slashes his face when he breaks off their affair. The film risks the reduction of scholar and Holocaust victim Sabina Speilrein, via Knightly's performance and the speculation of an epic love affair, to a mad but one-note seductress who spews clichés in her farcical and throaty Russian accent; \\"I want you to punish me.\\" The best scenes are those between Jung and Freud, arguing over the future legacy of psychoanalysis, to the point that one wonders why the mediating figure of Knightly's Spielrein was necessary at all.<br /><br />A Dangerous Method disappointingly relies almost entirely on a sense of historical gravitas to carry the story; it is bloated with a sense of documentarian import, while taking little care with the figures and events it portrays. Overall, the film is mediocre, and runs long.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I find it boring, but the kids love to play it.  The really like this updated version and that they can &#34;upgrade people&#34;.
B007XF0X16|5.0|We are very satisfied due to getting it in a reasonable fast time!!!! Disk and disk cover in good shape!!!!
B00AYJBT66|5.0|Owning original stereo release, I was surprised with energy coming from this mono mix. I surely prefer it to the original stereo! Pressed on dead quiet vinyl, it's highly recommended release.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|songs are amazing!! love this cd and recommend this to everyone. I listen to this constantaly and now I have my friend singing the songs. lol
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|although, I found the book did keep my interest, I thought it was a bit long winded at times.  This story would better be portrayed in a movie.
B000FA675C|5.0|I had already listened to the audio book.  When this came up for free I grabbed it.  I love how he incorporates actual facts of symbols, groups and practices into his novel.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It is a wonderful story. It keeps you interested.  I watched  all 3 seasons in 4 days. Can't wait for Season 4.
B00BW5K5DO|1.0|I thought this would be fun, but got lost in the rhetoric! May try it again sometime, but have eliminated it from my kindle!
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Well performed. Only 4 stars because that type of movie is not my thing, but is was a good movie. Nothing negative about the movie.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Brilliantly written about a brilliant man, tough at times, but always striving for perfection.  And look what he has done.  I enjoyed learning all the background of his life.
1419705849|5.0|Diary of Wimpy Kid is big right now.  My kids have read most of the books.  They really enjoyed this one too!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I read this book following Mr. Kyle's untimely death. Given Mr. Kyle's background, I expected to find it full of bravado: not so. It is a picture of an all-too-human warrior, immersed in his craft, but trying to resolve the internal conflicts of what he perceived as his duty to his country, his team, and his family. It is painful in its honesty. What makes this memoir so much different, so much better, than others, is the involvement of Mr. Kyle's wife. Her perspective emerges through her asides in the book, which adds a degree of humanity lacking in other books of this genre.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|This is the second pair I've bought for my son. The first broke after a little over a year. The wires connecting to the head set broke/shorted out. For the price you pay they could use higher quality materials. Easy to install and use.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Quentin has done it again!!<br />Christoph Waltz was stellar-- as usual!<br />All the acting was top notch and was a great movie!
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|Maybe good for a young reader, but quite juvenile.  The writing was not up to a caliber I am used to, though subject matter had some thought.
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you love the card game, this app is for you!!!!! I bring it every where!!!!!!!!!!! Works great on my Kindle Fire and never had a problem.
B006YC74E8|5.0|Love this app! and its free! Easy to use it has lots and lots of cool effects too! 5+ stars!
B00BYOEZTI|5.0|If you were a fan of the Lord of the Rings movies than you pretty much know what to expect. Loved the movie but the novelty has somewhat worn off given that the trilogy was such a huge hit.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|My friend way right this book is amazing well written and the author is a genius. This is one of the best books I've ever read
B00B7Y0206|5.0|The ability to select and listen to the music I enjoy provides many hours of pleasure.  It is also fun to watch many of the other more popular events that have managed to get on to YouTube.
B008KE3960|5.0|Imagine a tower defense game with no stationary towers.  Now download and play Air Patriots.  Yes...it really is that good!!!!!
B004GFN11A|5.0|I like this app alot, it helps me edit my website even when I'm felling a little lazy to get on the PC... :P
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Not as original as the original starring Arnold but the special effects are good and the story is engaging. Just not very original.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book was amazing how much detail the author put. I love the book I will not have a doubt about it
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Cheese.... y. So cheesy! Like Twilight, which is began as a fanfiction of, it ends &#34;happily ever after&#34; with children and marriage, despite all the wimpy drama.<br /><br />There are better mysteries, better romance novels, and more in depth characters out there. I regret wasting my money on this series to see why everyone else was reading it. You're better off with a Danielle Steele from the Dollar General if you want romance and mystery.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|This is a proof that Daft Punk do what they want to do, where they want to do it, and know what they do.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I like this a lot it makes it a ton easier to tweet when ever I want, and fast... 5 Stars
B002TVQ4AS|5.0|This is a true treasure of Cuban jazz. It is soulful, rich and such a fantastic collection of music.  Classic older artists sing and play so that you feel like you are tnere!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Pretty good! Getting ready to buy next volume now! I know the show is based off this but im ready to see what else is different.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|You can tell this was a fanfic of Twilight. That said, the female lead here was MUCH less offensive than Bella, in that at least she tried to be self sufficient.<br /><br />Just read it to see what everyone was so interested in. Sex scenes, apparently, because that's the majority of the book. Sadly, if that's what you're after there are still better written and more... interesting... sex scenes in other novels. This one is for virgins who wouldn't know better.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|Just keeps getting better and better! I love Walt and Jesse and the crazy stuff they get themselves into! Great show!
B00BHMF578|5.0|I&#34;ve finally caught my breath. This film had me on the edge of my seat from the beginning to the very end; and then some! I remember when this really happened. Pres Carter might have one re-election if he'd been able to claim credit for this mission! Everyone needs to see this movie!
B0043VDIAG|5.0|I have read Nicholas Sparks' books before but this just hooked me in and I could not put the book, and in this case my Kindle down. I really loved this story and its characters. :)
0718177029|5.0|I chose this ratingbecause I thoroughly enjoyed thisbook There was nothing about it that I didnt like  I would and have recommended it to all my friends and my book club
0740797719|5.0|This book is probably the single most valuable artists reference that I own; not in terms of its price tag, but in terms of its worth. It is the single most useful, practical guide for either recreating light conditions or applying color theory that I've ever encountered. It deserves a place on your reference shelf.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|4 stars because there are in-app purchases. I should not have to pay to unlock other modes and stuff. ANways...this game is fun!
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|C'mon, Karl Urban is not that well known. The movie could have shown his face a time or two. Otherwise, like most remakes, the story line was exactly like the original, which made it, almost as good as the original.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|My daughter made me watch it with her.  I really liked it, I was surprised.  The music gets stuck in you head and when I hear one of the songs on the radio I have to smile.
0670026557|4.0|First of all I would like to comment on the subtitle \\"A Revolutionary Approach to Success\\".  This is something that has always somewhat disturbed me about much discussion around \\"giving\\" or \\"serving\\".  It's like the huckster holy roller who says if you give money to him God will return it a hundred fold.  Giving makes you happy.  Givers end up receiving more than they give, etc.  I've always found this all a bit hypocritical and disturbing.<br /><br />However, I must say that the way it is presented in this book is much more straightforward and honest.  There is quite a bit of discussion in this book about how giving increases the pie for everyone and it is really a win-win approach.  It also discusses how givers can be doormats and finish last or be generous reciprocators and finish first and the way to make sure you end up in the latter group.<br /><br />This is a very well written book with tons of examples from real life.  It's interesting and I think the topic is important.  The approach taken in the book does not strike me as hypocritical and self-righteous as much of the stuff I have read before has.  Therefore, I think this book is a very good contribution to the topic.  It is about how you CAN contribute to others and how that benefits everyone including yourself and makes the world a better place for everyone.  Ultimately it is about being successful and not about being self-sacrificial. If some kind of feel-good self sacrifice is what you are looking for then you probably should look elsewhere.<br /><br />Recommended.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|i have enjoyed Daniel Craig's  last 2 James Bond movies.  not so with this one,  it was a bit retro, but not in any enjoyable way.  tedious,  at best
B00BF11STU|4.0|Very well done. It does have some inconsistencies, but all in all this movie is very thought provoking. I would recommend this movie to anyone who followed these events in the process of capturing Osama.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|This was a very &#34;dark&#34; movie. I'm sure they filmed it that way for dramatic effect. It worked because this was a very dark time in American History.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|There is no greater pleasure in all of life than putting on my Sony Walkman, putting my ear buds into my outer ears, and then making little devil fingers as I bang my head hard to the sweet and melodic pop sounds of Volbeat. If Abba and the soundtrack to Mamma Mia ever copulated and gave birth to an offspring, it would definitely sound a little bit better than this sweet CD offering by Volbeat. And you can quote me on that, playa!<br /><br />Volbeat has always been at the forefront of hardcore and melodic Danish pop-dance music, and I'm overly overjoyed that I was able to borrow this CD from my best friend (thanks, Hornito!!) to listen to Volbeat. The song selection on this dance-pop CD is so amazingly camp and butt-shaking that I just can't help shrieking my lungs out in Liberace-style delight.<br /><br />On Pearl Hart, the members of Volbeat sing about their love of going out to dance clubs and hopefully meeting that special someone whom they can take back to their bachelor pads to shag until the break of dawn. On Lola Montez, the boys in this teeny bopper band enjoy the awesomeness of wubba-wubba vocals mixed in with dance grooves that would make even Simon Cowell pump both of his fists in ecstasy-shaking delight. Hot diggity!!<br /><br />Folks, if you enjoy beating your Volbeat until the break of dawn--as I have been documented to--then please go out and purchase this CD from your nearest Blockbuster Video. Sure, you may not feel like going out anymore because an Obama drone strike may catch you off guard, but I urge you to buy this CD from Amazon right now. I give you my personal Gilby Guarantee that you will enjoy it more than lukewarm water straight from the tap!
B00BF11STU|5.0|Just an all around great movie. Strong acting, directing, and cinematography. Although the end was a forgone conclusion, it was still compelling.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|Great movie!  I somehow accidentally ordered two of these, which is fine I'll just pass one on.  Its a great movie and I think any one would like it in their collection.
B009NX409M|2.0|One star goes to Robert DeNiro and one star goes to Meryl Streep. This movie was slow and ridiculous. If it hadn't been two actors of such renown, I would have quit watching after 20 minutes.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|Are you kidding me? What a ridiculous movie. If they'd only left out the dancing and stage changes...Keira, better luck next time.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Item arrived promptly and in good condition.  I have not watched the entire series, but so far I have enjoyed the episodes.  It was my son who recommended I purchase this series since he knew I liked &#34;Band of Brothers' so much.  Thank you.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|They certainly found the magic formula with this show! There aren't too many TV series that draw me in and make me jones for the next episode, but this is definitely one of them!
B005HSL626|3.0|It is not my favorite game. It is ok. Once you get to a certain level, it is difficult to increase your best.
B00406TRU4|5.0|With this beloved series soon coming to an end, I will try to acquire all seasons, soon. All the good shows are stopped and stupid reality shows (Splash?) continue. Really!?!!!!???
B005LAIIFS|4.0|Classic movie the family will watch for years to come. Both our 18 month  old and 9 year old love this movie.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Riveting, white knuckled, yet a soft side kind of book.  Keeps you turning the pages.  I couldn't read it fast enough in anticipation of whatever was next.  Read it again, slower paced and appreciated not only the service of Chris Kyle but those who follow him in their  dedication to honor, duty, country.<br /><br />It's a whole new insight to a military way of life.
B0063GORYU|1.0|I will be uninstalling this app.  I spend more time trying to close the pop-up adds that appear each time I deal a hand than I do playing the game.  No, I do not want to know about singles in my area... Christian or not.  I wanted to play solitaire.
B003NHRGSQ|3.0|I thought shiver was a good start, but the characters fell really flat in this one.. also .I don't like Isabel and this book was a lot about her.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Good time waster, long game without spending money. Fun for the whole family!  Allows you to build funds or buy them.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of the most marvelous books I ever read I think every body should read this book I love it
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have always been a spiritually minded person, but I never considered how important it is to see consciousness and brain function as completely separate entities.  This book has opened my eyes to why I have always struggled to reconcile the two.  They can never be completely reconciled, as they 're different as night and day.  Thanks for telling. Your story.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|I thought this was interesting and possibly a good start to a new series. however the characters were flat though.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Season 1 of Smash was great.  I wish they had not made so many changes to Season 2 and it would probably not be facing cancellation.  Season 1 had a singular focus with great songs and a genuine rivalry between two ingenues......great story!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The visual effects and pictorial quality are stunning.  They strengthened the underlying but complicated message.  There were some excellent lines that led to my buying the book to read.  As tough as Pi's experiences were, we were left with a sense of exhilaration by the time his journey was fully related.
B00005N6KG|5.0|A low cost headphone solution with very good sound.  While it isn't as good as the over-the-ear headphones, they are great for exercising, working around the house, or other tasks where $150 headphones aren't appropriate.  I've used them for years and have been very pleased.
0553103547|5.0|As a fan of Lord of the Rings, I will stick my neck out and say George R. R. Martin is the millennial's version of J. R. R. Tolkien.  Both authors have produced epic sword fantasy series while ensuring all the books they write are of the highest quality.  If you like Lord of the Rings then you will LOVE A Game of Thrones!  A Game of Thrones is a lot darker then LotR but thats not a bad thing.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I LOVE it so much.  I play it all the time and so do my kids.  Everyone should try it right away.  And it's FREE!!!!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I'VE EVER READ IN MY LIVES!!! SOOO AWESOME!!!<br />BEST BOOK EVER!!! :)
1936608898|5.0|I think it is an easy read and has the info necessary to work the Paleo program.<br />I would recommend this to everyone trying to change their health.
B00BWJ6JO4|4.0|I don't know what everyone was talking about. I loved this movie. I didn't think it was too long nor boring.
B003FBMS4W|3.0|I wanted to watch this movie because I was interested in his portrayal of a raciest ex-Civil War soldier looking for his niece who was captured by Indians. The movie is dated and the acting is somewhat stiff. I was underwhelmed by the performances of everyone. Sadly, the movie stopped five minutes before the end, and I was not able to complete the movie. By that time, I didn't care, though I knew what happened, because I had seen this film years ago. So, perhaps I am jaded by today's acting, but I find that the scene was supposed to be Texas, but it was filmed in Monument Valley, New Mexico. I don't think a director would make that mistake today.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book will open your eyes to the stereotypes ingrained in men and women in regards to women's careers. The book was concise and fun to read. I think this should be required reading for men and women in the workforce.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Watching the world change from two points of view is a valuable history lesson.<br />I also like the way the writers allowed the characters to develop over time.<br />The end of the third season was devastating....I so hope that Matthew will be with us next season,,,but he looked so DEAD!.
1118490371|5.0|Pros:<br />Easy to read.<br />Great for beginners.<br /> Easy to navigate (table of contents/index easy to understand).<br />Cons:<br />It is good for beginners, for the more advanced processes it is not all that helpful.<br />Dumbs it down alot and makes it seem somewhat childish for people who already understand how excel/VBA work.<br /><br />Overall, it is a good product. I was hoping it would be more in depth but it will get the job done. It gives you the basic tools you need to code in excel VBA, and helps the user understand how it all works.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|great series right from the incredible introduction and music, to the caracters, to the plot, everything is great. Beware: creates addiction.
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|This is a wonderful collection of LMA's works. It contains works I've never read before. It's edited well; I haven't found any errors so far.
B006CHML4I|1.0|This watch looks nothing like it looks in the ad. You have to wear it everyday or it will stop running. Would not recommend it. Please do not buy, you'll regret it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Highly, highly recommend it. I never thought I'd get addicted to this show. But craving my evening dose every day, apparently I am. Great story line, unusual setting, fantastic acting. Sometimes I wish the stories were less &#34;dark&#34; and more happy moments, but I guess that's what other shows are for...
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin does a masterful job of portraying the marvelous and unique man and leader that Abraham Lincoln was. In today's environment when the two parties refuse to agree on which direction the sun rises, it is inconceivable that Mr. Lincoln managed to put a cabinet together of egotistical and ambitious men that ran against him when he ran for president.<br /><br />I have read countless books on various parts of Abe Lincoln's life, but only a handful compete with Team Of Rivals. Ms. Goodwin brings to life not only Mr. Lincoln, but also such great men as William H.Seward, Salmon P. Chase and Edward Bates (A southern Democrat). Each of these men ran for president and were shocked and outraged when Abe became the alternative choice to a divided Republican Convention. That Mr. Lincoln managed to emerge as the nominee was a small miracle, and greater still was him going on to win the presidency, but the greatest miracle was that he brought his opponents together, forming a cabinet of men who viewed themselves as superior in most every way.<br /><br />There was a half year gap between Lincoln winning the election and when he became president, as there was not a quick exchange of power in those days after an election. The pro slave faction attempted to murder him before he even took office, but he sneaked into Washington on a train to be sworn in and accept his position as the president of the United States. Along with him came all the men who ran against him. They united around the country and this unusual man who was now their leader. Mr. Bates was from the south, but he was pro Union and crossed party and regional divisions to become an important member of President Lincoln's Cabinet. Mr. Chase emerges as a financial wizard, brilliant in so many ways, but ambitious to a fault. Mr. Seward, the man from New York, who probably should have become president, and perhaps had the most difficulty adjusting to playing second fiddle to the tall President Lincoln, evolved into a loyal and trusted confidante of the president.<br /><br />The formation of the Cabinet was not easy, but the men stood together, forming one of the most interesting and unexpected Cabinets in the history of our country. Their collective effort helped the remarkable President Lincoln to save the union from being broken apart. Ms. Goodwin brilliantly highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each of the most powerful men in this remarkable story. I found it fascinating that an age totally dominated by men is told so marvelously by a woman.<br /><br />Collectively, President Lincoln and his Cabinet defeated the South and freed the slaves. Ms. Goodwin treats each man with respect, pointing out their flaws, but also careful to illustrate their brilliance. Mr. Chase is a good example, as he is portrayed as a valuable part of the administration and war effort, but also a egotistical loose cannon that straddled the line between doing his part for the war effort and pursuing self interests in a shameful fashion, perhaps even undermining President Lincoln's reelection, obviously hoping to emerge as the candidate to beat. Ms. Goodwin skillfully tells this and other intriguing and captivating story lines concerning this particular Cabinet and their tall, simple, straight-forward President.<br /><br />This is a great historical book, one that I wish every American (and others too) would read. I also must ask if these men who were so different, ambitious and competitive could come together for the good of the country, why can't the current dimwits in Congress do so instead of bickering shamelessly while the country's potential diminishes with each passing day. Congress did not always want to do the right thing in Lincoln's day either, but Mr. Lincoln stepped up to the plate and was able to convince his rivals to put aside their ambitions and egos to help him do what was best for the country. Have we become too dysfunctional as a country and people to do thattoday?<br /><br />Another reality that you get from reading this book is that the two political parties have flip-flopped. Whereas the Republicans of Mr. Lincoln's day were clearly the anti-slavery, progressive party and the Democratic Party the pro-slavery, reactionary party, that is obviously not the case today when the Democrats pretend to be progressive while the Republicans become more reactionary with each passing day. One wonders where the adults are like Mr. Bates in the Republican Party today. As bad as the Democratic Party was in Lincoln's day, there were brave, decent and sensible men such as Mr. Bates who took a firm stand against the reactionaries in their own party.<br /><br />Reading Team Of Rivals will remind you how much the two parties have changed, but also how the two-party system and partisan politics has not changed at all. I tip my hat to Mr. Lincoln, his Cabinet, the men who fought for the Union, the brave women in the North who provided the soldiers in the Union much greater support than the Confederate soldiers received from the South. I applaud Ms. Goodwin for writing such an impressive, entertaining and valuable historical book. [[ASIN:B009YO9N2O MADAM PRESIDENT (American Myth Series)]]
B009EEFTMC|5.0|BE WARNED!!!  This is a very addictive little time waster!  I love it and always say I'm going to play just one game and next thing I know, 15 minutes has passed!  Lots of fun!
B000FA675C|5.0|This book is one of the best I have ever read. The suspence and the turns and twists, I love it. I cannot wait for the next one to come out...:)
B004TI5N38|5.0|David Baldacci is one of the greatest mystery writers ever. He is able to draw you to such great characters. This one is totally exciting.
B006UIUJ2A|4.0|I really enjoyed this story!<br />Just as I finished reading it, the news headlines were filled with the latest threats from North Korea!
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|This is a great drawing app.  My kids love the variety of lines and textures they can get and especially love the stickers.  It can be a little difficult to manipulate, but I think this is a matter of practice and getting a feel for it.  Like it very much.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Having a relative who was on an Orphan train, this book caught my interest.  It was a totally enjoyable read.  It has a multi generational aspect that is interesting.  The story of being an orphan is depected graphically but not belabored.  The reader \\"gets\\" the expereince, which to me shows good writing.  I recommend it highly.
B00B1MHXY2|5.0|I remember that it was album of the year. Given all the turmoil that the band was experiencing during the development of this album, it is amazing that that it did so well. Some of these songs have defined this band and continue to stand the test of time.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The Misremembered Man is a lovely, heartfelt story that is actually very simple in it's story-line.<br />Whilst reading the story, you get a fantastic sense of being in rural Ireland.<br />If you enjoyed The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry, then you may enjoy this too.
0425263908|4.0|I was looking for more 50 shades.  This is like its tamer cousin.  You don't read this for the literature.  You read it for what it is.  And for that it is a fun read.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Everyone loves it, so why should you read it too?  Because you will wind up feeling as if you ARE capable of dog-think.  It is funny and heart warming and has the most wonderful ending.  Do not be afraid that this will be a morbid account of an ageing dog.  It is anything but that.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I really like it, its funny and stuff!! I really recommend this awesome book!! I cant wait for the next book!!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Great on my tablet. Easy to use and large enough to see the numbers and symbols. Would suggest it for anyone who wants a basic calculator.
B0071XO8RA|1.0|This book confused me, and I do not get confused easily.  I felt the story was very incomplete, but I was hopeful that it would piece together eventually.  It never did.
B008H7HE9S|5.0|Love this album, every song on it is a hit!!  And we got it like a day or so after we ordered it - just in time for a trip in the car to listen to it!!  :)
B00BESM14U|5.0|I read the book when I got it for Christmas, and had very high hopes for the movie. Was not disappointed. Charlie's voice was as present in the narration of this movie as it was in the novel. Ezra and Emma were amazing. This movie made me think about life (just like the book). This motion picture is as my friend Lydia would say &#34;A gewd one.&#34;
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book, very easy to read. Subject keeps you very interested and sometimes excited. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|very very fun game a must have for anyone. I'm a 90s kid so this is like the ultimate dream come true.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I have been a huge fan over the seasons -actually started watching on re-runs and it never disappoints! Can never have enough
B001I45UFC|5.0|This is not only an excellent book but also an excellent movie. It will keep your interest, as will C. S. Lewis' other books. The book/movie is one of great imagination that keeps you wondering what will happen next.  It is not only about good vs. evil, but Aslan in the book represents Jesus, the Lion of Judah and what He endured for us and how He is there for us. Aslan speaks but the children must listen to His instruction,many times for their lives. It is also the way for us--Jesus speaks and we need to listen.It is a must read and the movie is well worth seeing.<br />Give both a try and see if you won't truly enjoy them.<br />Some school classes use this book for their class reading/discussion.  It is a great book for all ages.  Enjoy!!!
B003QSLW0K|5.0|We had a blast taking a ride with Lilo, Nani and Stitch!<br />A library keeper in our ohana!<br />Cannot wait to watch Lilo and Stitch 2

B004SRPXWQ|1.0|My children can be amused by Talking Tom for atlest ten whole minutes, WHEN IT ACTUALLY WORKS. It keeps stopping after about thiry seconds. What a big disappointment.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This was a favourite book as a child and as it was free I decided to download it, was even better than I remember, not sure that I understood the messages as a child.  I wonder what children of 9-10 years would make of the language today!
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I love this album.<br />There isn't a song on here that I dislike. I really like their sound as a whole; I think it's a step up from Transatlanticism.

B00AIBZJLG|4.0|Bits and pieces of all the Las Vegas shows.  Some of the better acts from each of the ones there.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Love all the batman movies and love that they are all available in the trilogy set. It was a great birthday gift! Price was wonderful for 20 dollars.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|...because I didn't know it was a book!<br />Agh. I wish I would have read it before. This book is amazing. I cried more than I should have reading this. Charlie is easy to relate to, and style in which the book is written makes it easy for the reader to get inside his head.
B000P5FH3K|5.0|When I received the dvd it was in good condition,no problem playing in my dvd player. It definitely was worth the $ nspent.
B00005KISG|5.0|Same as the last it was fine thank you I think writing a long review should be up to the customer if they want to or not!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game rocks! I love playing it! It helps me with my hand-eye coordination.I will play it every day !
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|I'm not a huge Justin Timberlake fan, but I really liked Suit and Tie, so I figured why not try the whole album?<br />There are several really good songs on here. Some others, though, you have to have patience to listen to them. Some continue on for 6-8 minutes, which can get a little annoying.<br />And can we all pause for a minute and acknowledge the sexiness that is JT? :)
B000Y7U98W|5.0|i thought this movie was a refreshing different sci-fi movie for all the others. sun will not always be there for us just liked it. b.a.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Love this movie! Video play was smooth and consistent. Would definitely recommend this movie rental from  amazon  to my friends and family

B00B6QXN56|2.0|I can not believe I spent money trying to bring something original and new but I got broken! The CD case was broken inside, opening the plastic wrap, I opened the lid and went out to see the second CD I noticed that the inner cover was also broken!
B002N3GD2Q|5.0|As so many here I am a long time Doors fan.  Have all the original albums etc. Finally bought the Felt Forum CDs and SO glad I did.  WOW just wow.  At the best the Doors could be.  These CDs are well done and the music is exceptional.  They were just so damn good.  To really enjoy this I became for a moment back in 1970 smoking a J and jamming to the Doors.<br />Righteous man!

B00867GKIK|4.0|originally saw UP in the theater in 2D.  This type cartoon is improved by the 3D process.  If you like this type kid, adult friendly, cartoon then you will like UP.  I recommend the 3D version to maximumize the experience.
B00454U1NS|4.0|Love P!nk and the music on this cd is terrific!!! But there's no reason for 'Perfect' to have such intense cursing, I've never heard this version before!! I was surprised the cd wasn't marked explicit on Amazon. While there's other mild cursing on the cd, I'm trying to figure a way to re record just this song because it changes the emotion of the song from 'passionate' to 'ANGRY!'.

B001TH8UUA|5.0|AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI Cable (9.8 Feet/3.0 Meters) [Supports 3D} did meet my expectations. I will purchase this product again in the future as needed.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|Not bad but not great and certainly not what I had been hoping for. There is so much CGI, it could almost be considered an animated film. At no time are you unaware that you're watching computer generated characters and or scenery, which is bad news when you're watching a movie that's full of it.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This product is excellent and will buy more.  I love the quality of the product and it is exactly what I wanted.  Everyone should buy this it is worth the money Love it

B00192IOBA|5.0|I decided to check this out after seeing &#34;Butterfly&#34; recommended somewhere else. Now I can't stop listening to it. It's on perpetual repeat :-) Jason Mraz has a fabulous voice and his lyrics are wonderful. Highly recommended!
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|The best parts of this movie were in the commercials. The rest of it was full of pointless cursing and a very limited plot. Very disappointed. Only good thing about this movie was that I like the main actors, otherwise it would have received 1 star from me.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This is not the type of book I would normally read, but I was able to identify with the main character's angst in loving someone that can never give you what you need. I am not sure if I plan to read the other two books but I am glad that I allowed myself to finish this book despite feeling caught off guard by Mr. Grey's sexual preferences. Until now I'd only understood BDSM from a psychological point of view and while reading this book has not changed my opinion of that it has helped me in being more open-minded about people that make this choice in intimate expression.
B00BGZ8TVA|4.0|After all the rave reviews I thought I would be mesmerized.  Not so.  The computer graphics were very good but could have been more.  The story was good, but not enough depth.  The ending was excellent.

B001BANK32|4.0|I've been a fan for nearly 30 years, yet had never read this offering from Mr. King.  Since a book coming out later this year is going to deal with the young protagonist, Danny, all grown up, I decided to get the back story.  I was not disappointed.  The characters are well fleshed out and King provides such keen details in all his works that his books play like movies in my mind.<br /><br />I am now anxiously awaiting Doctor Sleep this fall.
B003LR5BD0|4.0|Out of all the movies Christopher Nolan has directed, \\"Insomnia\\" is probably the most... normal. No dream technology, no superheroes, no magical Tesla devices.<br /><br />No, \\"Insomnia\\" is pretty much a cop thriller about hunting down a murderer. But it's much deeper and more layered than it sounds -- it's a tragic, haunting story of a good cop who begins sliding inexorably down, until he ends up collaborating with a murderer. And in true Nolan style, it's murky and slightly disorienting.<br /><br />LAPD detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are sent to the remote town of Nightmute, up in Alaska, to investigate the shocking death of a teenage girl. There's some tension between the detectives because Dormer is under investigation by Internal Affairs, and Eckhart is going to testify against him.<br /><br />And since Nightmute is in the Arctic Circle, the sun never sets in summer. Unable to sleep, Dormer becomes increasingly disoriented -- until he accidentally shoots Eckhart while chasing the murderer.<br /><br />Knowing that no one would believe it was an accident, Dormer desperately hides the evidence of his crime. But there was one witness to the shooting -- the murderer, mystery writer Walter Finch (Robin Williams). Finch is only willing to keep silent if Dormer frames the dead girl's boyfriend, and lets him go free.<br /><br />Based on a Norwegian film of the same name, \\"Insomnia\\" is essentially a study of guilt. It's never entirely clear whether Dormer's insomnia is caused by the daylight (symbolic light of truth?) or his own guilty conscience, but the events of the movie are a tragic portrait of a fundamentally good man degenerating before our eyes.<br /><br />And it's one of the best roles that Al Pacino has done in years -- he depicts Dormer as a man who desperately wants to do the right thing, but is twisted into doing the WRONG thing out of his own fear. And Nolan leaves you wondering if, on some subconscious level, he did want to shoot his partner for betraying him.<br /><br />And if Dormer is in the middle of the moral spectrum, then Finch and Ellie Burr are on the two extremes. I normally cannot stand Robin Williams, but he gives a surprisingly good performance as a genial yet ice-cold murderer who wants to drag Dormer down with him. And Hilary Swank is excellent as a pure-hearted young cop who is investigating Eckhart's murder.<br /><br />As for Nolan, he cloaks the movie in a sense of stillness and a pale, strange daylight that never goes away, and he builds up a slow-burning sense of suspense right to the subdued ending. This makes it all the more shocking when Dormer's sleeplessness catches up to him, causing him to act recklessly and even hallucinate -- suddenly the world seems jagged and chaotic for a few minutes, before snapping back to normal.<br /><br />In fact, the movie is at its weakest when it focuses just on police procedural stuff, instead of following Dormer's descent. Even if those scenes are essential to the plot, Nolan cannot make that interesting.<br /><br />While not exactly what people expect from Christopher Nolan, \\"Insomnia\\" is a beautifully tragic little movie, with amazing acting and exquisite direction.to shoot his partner for betraying him.<br /><br />And if Dormer is in the middle of the moral spectrum, then Finch and Ellie Burr are on the two extremes.

B00000JSJC|4.0|Before she won the Academy Award for best director, Kathryn Bigelow did all sorts of movies -- war movies, vampire movies, cop thrillers, dramas.<br /><br />But one of the more unusual movies she directed was \\"Strange Days,\\" a cyberpunk murder-mystery set in the violent futuristic world of... 1999. Okay, the depiction of the turn of the millennium is a little distracting, but not enough to keep this from being a vivid, sometimes horrifying little thriller, with astonishingly good performances by Angela Bassett and Ralph Fiennes.<br /><br />In the not-too-distant past (sorry, I'll stop doing that), a new form of entertainment has come up: the SQUID, an illegal device which can record and play back memories. So a person can become anybody they want, doing anything they want -- sex, robbery, anything.<br /><br />Former cop Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) specializes in recording and selling bootleg SQUID recordings, when he isn't pining after his rocker ex-girlfriend Faith (Juliette Lewis). But then a call girl who works for him is brutally raped and murdered -- and Lenny is given the \\"blackjack\\" (snuff) SQUID disc from the murderer's perspective. He can't take the evidence to the cops, because he knows that they will assume he's the killer.<br /><br />So he enlists his friend Mace (Angela Bassett) and private eye buddy Max (Tom Sizemore) to help him track down the murderer -- whom he suspects to be Faith's new boyfriend, a record mogul named Philo (Michael Wincott). But as the bodies continue to pile up, Lenny discovers that the murders are tied to a famous rapper's recent death, and if the truth is revealed, it could unleash chaos on L.A...<br /><br />Yes, I found it a bit distracting that \\"Strange Days\\" takes place in the final few days of 1999, since the actual turn of the millennium was much duller than Kathryn Bigelow's version. Here's it's a festering sea of violence and social unrest, splattered with virtual pleasures, lurid colors and jagged rock'n'roll -- which gives it a distinct style that is still rooted in 90s aesthetics.<br /><br />The heart of the movie is a murder mystery, and Bigelow does an excellent job winding up a complex story that happens to rely on sci-fi technology. The biggest problem is that the first part of the movie really drags, mostly focusing on Lenny peddling his SQUID wares and reliving old memories. The story only really gets moving when Iris dies.<br /><br />But once it does get moving, it's excellent -- fast-paced and tightly-wound, with the occasional quiet moment to let the characters blossom. And Bigelow uses the SQUID POV shots brilliantly, letting us see the brutality and horror as if we were actually living it.<br /><br />Lenny a character we shouldn't really like. He's an ex-cop who has now basically become a drug dealer, and is still pathetically pining after his ex. But there's something just so boyish and charming about Fiennes that you end up rooting for him. And he has electric chemistry with Bassett, who plays a strong, capable woman who secretly loves him despite herself... and looks totally believable when she kicks butt in a spangly dress. Not many women in Hollywood can do that.<br /><br />However, Juliette Lewis is so annoying that she will make you want to rip off your own ears. I know she's supposed to be a skanky, nutty rock chick in the vein of Courtney Love, but she is just insufferable. Why is Lenny so obsessed with her?!<br /><br />\\"Strange Days\\" takes a long time to rev up, but its cyberpunk whodunnit is well worth the watch -- as is Bigelow's outstanding direction. Party like it's 1999!ves it a distinct style that is still rooted in 90s aesthetics.<br /><br />The heart of the movie is a murder mystery, and Bigelow does an excellent job winding up a complex story that happens to rely on sci-fi technology.

B0000844IT|5.0|One of the best.  Greta movie, and probably the best version one can get.  I would highly recommend it to any fan
B009G3T01M|5.0|macklemore and ryan lewis made some magic in this album. i love the raps in it. totally tubular. Hot like tobasco!!
B0034G4OUO|5.0|This movie may not be as popular as some other movies but its a good one. Dwayne Johnson gets in trouble being a driver in a bank robbery, nearly gets killed before serving time in prison. He gets revenge on the people who tried to kill him and who killed the rest of the people that were in the bank robbery with him. Billy Bob Thorton was one of the bad guys who turned out to be a dirty cop. There is a lot of action in this movie and it does involve Dwayne driving a fast car. If you like this type of movie I would definitely reccommend it.
B00B671VYU|4.0|I've been a HUGE fan of Lordi since I first heard Hard Rock Hallelujah a few years ago. Since then, I've collected and cherished all of their studio albums, and they stand as one of my all-time favorite heavy metal bands.  When I heard that the band's long-time drummer, Kita, had left the band, I was distraught. Not only was he a great drummer and an awesome character in the band's mythology, but he was also the one doing all the backing vocals since Get Heavy - which I considered one of Lordi's best assets. The departure of the band's then-current keyboardist, Awa, was a sad moment as well, since she was my favorite keyboardist in the band's history.  So, going into To Beast or Not To Beast, I was afraid of how much the band's style would change.  After listening to the album, I can gladly say that, while this is the darkest and most different album in the band's discography, it's still a strong album. Not as good as the others - especially The Arockalypse - but still a solid album which still retains the band's soul.  Personally, I like all the songs on this album, however there are some stand out tunes worth mentioning. The first one is The Riff, the album's single. The music video I was not crazy about, but this song is energetic and fun, with the typical Lordi attitude. Other stand out songs include Horrifiction, Happy New Fear, among others.  All around, this is a good, solid album that proves Lordi's still got it in them! I would prefer that their future albums take on the style of The Arockalypse and Babes For Breakfast, but I still like the approach they took. For that, I give it a solid 4/5. Check it out! Worth a listen or two.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Successful install from Amazon but the game from up after the first level.  Had to remove the battery from the phone to restart.  Uninstalled and tried again from Google Play.  Same results.  The game is great fun and fast-paced, right up until it makes your device crash.  Had this problem on my Droid Bionic and Asus TF201 tablet.

B009E3EXMU|5.0|I haven't watched the bonus DVD yet but have listened to the two CDs and watched the Celebration Day DVD and I love it. The band is older of course but they still play some great music and its nice to see the fans and the band having a good time. Jason Bonham did a great job playing the drums as taking his Dad's place in this concert. If you like Led Zeppelin then you need to add this to your collection.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This was a great season but wow, what sad events occurred in this. This moves faster than the other seasons. I was kept intrigued the whole time. My husband is now watching this season and he well be shocked at the ending as well.

0393061310|4.0|Diamond obliterates the easy racist assumption that certain societies thrived and conquered others because of their inherent genetic or racial superiority.  If anything, he shows that on an individual level, the member of a \\"backward\\" culture is far more impressive than that of an \\"advanced\\" society.  To survive, that individual has to be, in many ways, smarter and more imaginative than his more \\"advanced\\" counterpart.  The point is that societies conquer on a societal level and that the specialization that gives advanced societies a comparative advantage doesn't necessarily produce the most impressive well-rounded individuals.<br /><br />Diamond's rebuttal of the kind of racist thinking that dominated the first half of the Twentieth Century is thorough, witty, and completely convincing.  Less successful is Diamond's second argument that geography has determined the fate of cultures -- i.e., the ability of Eurasian culture to conquer others.  Is it any accident that the person making this argument just happens to be a political geographer?  Still, Diamond's argument is subtle and impressive, if ultimately not quite as convincing as his anti-racist thesis.  He contends that geography determined what crops flourished, how easily they could be spread, and what domesticated animals could be used by the culture.  The Americas suffered from the wrong crops, lack of the set of large domesticated animals that flourished in Eurasia, and a north/south dominant axis (as opposed to east/west) that impeded the spread of crops, animals, technology, and advances.  Eurasian cultures had the animal power that permitted greater accumulation of wealth and population concentration and concomitant technological advantages.  And with the animals and rapid spread of disease came the \\"germs\\" and immunity that so advantaged Europe during the Columbian Exchange.<br /><br />It's an impressive argument, though once suspects that God does play dice with the fate of human cultures.  As even Diamond concedes, a different set of leaders in China in the 15th century might have led to the Chinese rather than the Spanish conquering the Americas.<br /><br />In fairness to Diamond, he is careful not to overargue his thesis and to invite further research and argument.<br /><br />Overall, a very impressive work.  From the perspective of entertainment value, I preferred Diamond's book on the collapse of cultures.  This book is a bit more dry, but quite good nonetheless.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|It was interesting because I did not know anyone with the disorder this woman had and how bad it could effect a person.  The &#34;thriller&#34; part of guy who was obsessed with the women was really exciting to see what the outcome would be.

B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|I read the books long ago in the 1970's and was fascinated.  There is some truths in myth, so ...  Tolkien wrote the book(s) after teaching mythology, and spent the rest of hiks life trying to have his books raised from fantasy to mythology and after his death his son continued the struggle.<br />  We who saw he &#34;reality&#34; of his works gravitated to that Middle Earth, and find the myth dreamer who can put it best on film (or disk these days).  This is the best version of &#34;The Hobbit&#34; I have ever seen, I still miss Tom Bombadil, but  I can live with it.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I am enjoying this game very much.  Gives hints without waiting too long.  Keeps you thinking and moving around which I like.  A+++++
B007GCY8FS|2.0|As I was reading this book I kept waiting for the actions to start, and the plot to develop.  When I finished reading the book I was still waiting.  The previous books have all had much more riveting and elaborate plots, along with many action scenes throughout the books.  I sincerely hope Lee returns to his roots on his next attempt.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I adore/love/worship this show. I have purchased every single season on DVD, and I have probably seen every single episode at least a dozen times. Over the past 8 years I have introduced probably 3 dozen new fans to the Supernatural universe. To be frank, each season is different. The first two seasons of the show focuses more on monster of the week stories mixed in with family drama. However, once the show progresses the storylines add a great deal of character development, and give the character's lives purpose. The Winchester boys start out as young novice monster hunters to seasoned, professional monster hunters/heroes. In the more recent seasons you learn the truth about their lineage, the history of the Supernatural world, and lore about every kind of monster/demon/angel imaginable. In truth, some of the episodes are better than others. Not everyone will appreciate all of the storylines, especially about Heaven, Hell and Angels. Personally, it never bothered me. I was able to focus on the actual show and remember that it is FICTIONAL. That being said, I would rate this as one of the most entertaining and greatest shows that I have ever seen. In short, this is definitely worth watching and buying.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|A lot of characters to keep track of, but always interesting. Sometimes there are years in between one episode and the next. Everything was great until the very end of this season - the death of an important character. Bummer, I suppose that person got a good offer to act elsewhere.

B009HEJXFS|5.0|We were nicely surprised by this film. Usually, the 3rd of a film series does a so-so job in storytelling. This one was very good. Of course, the ending is predictable but it was enjoyable throughout. Great to see if you had a tough day at work and want good entertainment.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed the book - little bit of spoiler alert.  I did not care for the ending however I guess the author is planning a sequel.

You can click a request to befriend other people that are already playing.  Again no personal information is needed.<br /><br />It does use energy and when you run out you do have to wait quite a while for it to recharge.

Don't have or want cable, so it wasnt until Amazon instant video Prime offered it that I was able to see it. Wow. Mystery, intrigue, good acting, humor, modern challenges all wrapped into one. Ahamed to say I watched many episodes right after another in one day. Look forward to the rest.
B009EBNSD2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this production!  Gemma Arterton was wonderful as Tess and the scenery was lovely.  If you like BBC shows, you will love this series!
B006LSZECO|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a while perfect for a vacation, long flight or beach read as it is thoroughly entertaining and you find that you can not put it down.  Suspenseful yet written which such a real modern voice that is completely relatable...it feels like you are reading about your friends.  Ending is a mindblower with which I am still trying to come to terms.

B00BQJTHYY|5.0|Honestly, not until a few years ago did I ever hear about Finntroll, nor did I ever even begin to imagine the idea of extreme metal fusing with traditional folk influences. Not surprising, considering the fact that when I was growing up throughout middle school and high school, the only kind of heavy rock-type stuff I could hear around me was Korn, Godsmack, Slipknot, Disturbed, or whoever else. Also, the way that all the girls were hyping out over N'SYNC and Backstreet Boys didn't help anything either.<br /><br />The day came a few years ago, when some guy suggested a list of bands for me to check out after I told him how I really liked heavy metal music. Needless to say, Finntroll happened to be one of these bands. Right away, I went online to check them out. As anyone could guess, I was instantly blown away by the fusion of extreme metal and traditional folk. That was when I purchased their Nifelvind album which had been released earlier in that year (2010). Since then, I have become a major fan, and I now own almost all of their entire discography.<br /><br />Alright, enough with the history of my life. Let's talk about this album. I bought it the day it came out, and now that I have listened to it from beginning to end plus some, so as to get a full grasp on it, I can honestly say that this is a really great folk metal album. Finntroll continue to deliver their brutal yet melodic sound that engages the listener every second of the way. As I see it, the material on this album might not be quite as memorable as the Nifelvind album. For example, I have yet to hear anything else from these guys that matches up to the 7-minute epic known as \\"Drap.\\" But does it really matter? Not at all! With the obvious layers of diverse instrumentation, acoustic breakdowns, fun rhythms, choir chants, and brutal yet articulated vocals, Blodsvept has everything you could ask for in a Finntroll album, or ANY folk metal album for that matter. I enjoyed every second of the listen through this album, so I would say that anyone who is a fan of Finntroll or of quality folk metal in general will not down this album.<br /><br />In short, you definitely need to get this album if you have enjoyed Finntroll's other albums. If you are new to Finntroll, I would suggest you first check out a few of their earlier releases, particularly [[ASIN:B001C71NME Nattf&ouml;dd]], [[ASIN:B001C763D8 Ur Jordens Djup]], and (as I mentioned earlier) [[ASIN:B003626TJU Nifelvind]].h this album, so I would say that anyone who is a fan of Finntroll or of quality folk metal in general will not down this album.<br /><br />In short, you definitely need to get this album if you have enjoyed Finntroll's other albums.

B004H1V5RU|4.0|Its hard to beat but rewarding once you do. The problem is once I beat it, I quickly got bored of it. You figure out strategies to get past certain obstacles so after you complete it once, it gets easier and easier each time you complete it. Still great for guests though.

B007W1BLN0|5.0|This film showed the rawness, beauty, and sometimes frailty of the human spirit- both our ability to forgive and our inability to forget.  It was moving both intellectually and aesthetically, with sweeping views of the wilderness and pinpoint insight into humanity itself.<br /><br />Well done.
B0014DQSGW|1.0|It was too silly and there was no real romantic spark between Bullock and Grant. It was not believable that they were in love.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|YOU DON'T WANT TO LAY HIS BOOKS DOWN --- READ A LITTLE BIT  HA HA  YOU JUST CAN'T DO IT!!!!
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|I love the concept of &#34;historical fiction&#34; covering the time of the vikings' discovery and invasion of England.  I cannot speak to the historical accuracy, but much of it rings true, with only a mild level of &#34;Hollywood license&#34; tossed in for pure entertainment.  The main characters are interestingly complex, and the cast is excellent at carrying them out in my view, especially the priest and earl (main bad guy).  I give it four stars instead of five because of some strong disagreements I have with a few plot decisions that could have been more compelling (only here and there).  I would now like to see a &#34;historian's cut&#34; in which an expert on the vikings would fill us in on what is truly known (i.e., based on historical evidence).  In any case, this is gripping entertainment with a wide-angle perspective on the evolution of humanity.  It is the rare series on my DVR for which each new episode is marked &#34;protect&#34;.  It is nice to know I can pick up missed episodes on Amazon Instant Video, as I did for Episode 1, but the Amazon video streaming technology is not yet as reliable as YouTube or Vimeo. (For example, avoid using the time-slider to seek, as it often locks up permanently).  Next time I will try &#34;download&#34;.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great Book, I love it. The book told so much about the training that our solders go through to become Seals. I am sure that there was some that was left out but was still good. What a privilege to be involved in the mission that to care of the Number One Enemy in the world. I know that was some many people that worked on the mission some behind the scenes and the others we know about. I would recommend this book if you like this type of reading. I would give it  all A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.

B00A9C3RNQ|4.0|The plot may be predictable but the acting is excellent in this heartwarming little movie. Better than your run of the mill chick flick and a good movie on one of those nights when you want to be entertained without working too hard. Steve Carroll was a pleasant surprise.

B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I love gritty cop dramas and this is one of the best. I can't believe I didn't watch this series when it was first run, but I'm glad I have the chance now to watch it continuously without commercial breaks. If you like Law & Order or Southland, you'll enjoy this series.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|The content of the Blu-ray discs was superb the only problem was the disc cover itself, when I opened up the packet the cover was cracked, not  a great problem.
076421120X|4.0|I received a complimentary copy of \\"Revealing Jesus\\" from Bethany House. This is a beautiful devotional book written by Darlene Zschech. The devotionals are just the perfect length and they are well thought out. The biggest downfall I find with the devotional is that there is not one consistent version of the Bible used throughout the book. I am not only convinced, but I am also convicted that the King James Bible is the most accurate version of the Bible for the English speaking people today. I feel that when a writer changes the version of the Bible for a devotional, they are trying to change the actual meaning of the passage to what they want it to say, but anyways, this isn't about my convictions about the Bible. This is about the devotional. I love that the devotional is hardback. So many devotional books are soft backed, so they get creases in the front and/or the covers get ripped. The graphics in the book are beautiful. The beginning of each month, has two full color pages with the month name and song lyrics. All in all it is a beautiful book, from the words on the page, to the graphics.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Once again, I WILL recommend this book to all those HOPELESS ROMANTICS. In the third book of this Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy there is a lot of SUSPENSION!!

B00902S0IS|5.0|Remember how the future used to be? Remember when our intelligence, our human values, and our belief in science held the ultimate promise for us: one day we will explore the universe? Remember when science fiction movies actually cared about science? Well, take a look at Forbidden Planet and see if its gee whiz-iness doesn't help you remember how stimulating the genre can be!
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|Hilarious! Great movie, definitely worth your time.  What makes it so great is it is totally relatable to real life.
B0036UMM84|3.0|It was sad and kind of hopeless, but the music was good...love Evergreen.  Unfortunately, it played very choppy on my laptop.
B001MTENOC|3.0|I felt like it could have been written in a lot less words. It seemed like it belabored the conclusions the author came to.

B005S9EKCW|5.0|Wow--really, wow. I'm a big fan of musicals and was somewhat familiar with the music from Les Miserables (Bring Him Home sung by Colm Wilkinson is on my top five favorite songs/performances of all time), I still wasn't prepared for what I saw. I knew beforehand that the performers were singing at the time of filming, and that is what we saw, so I expected some loss of song quality for the sake of acting, which was the case some of the time. Hugh Jackman has experience on Broadway, but I knew stepping into the shoes of Colm Wilkinson would be difficult for him to do. I was still very pleased with his voice and thrilled by his acting. I loved the fact that Colm did get a part in the movie--he plays the monsignior perfectly. Anne Hathaway was the breakout star of the movie, her performance was so powerful that it was obvious an Oscar was headed her way. Her singing was as good if not better than any recordings I've heard from the musical. She was simply breathtaking. The actor playing Marius was a little hard on the eyes and his voice a tad dated, but he gave a solid performance as did the rest of the lesser-known cast. Two wonderful, scene stealing hams, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter, gave us a needed break from the intensity of the film. My biggest problem was with Russell Crowe. I didn't mind his voice; I rather liked his style, even though it was not anywhere near the quality of the other players. However, as the movie progressed, his portrayal definitely dimmed in comparison to the other actors. Everyone was out-acting him, and he was the weak link of the production. Amanda Seyfried was another weak link for me--her thin, high, trillish voice wasn't always pleasing, even though she was suited for the part. Despite these faults, the power of the production and the overall quality of the movie is so high that I can still give it a five star review.
B00BHMF578|4.0|we really enjoyed the movie, but am surprised that it beat out Lincoln for the Academy Award for best picture
B005LAIHR2|1.0|I was so disappointed by this movie! Here are many BIG name actors/actresses and the plot stunk! The music of the era is awesome, the actors were ready and it just totally fell apart before it ever really got started. Even WITH Tom Cruise. Many times, his dialogue was uttered so quietly, I couldn't even hear him. It has potential, but sadly, the director should have yelled \\"CUT!\\" more often, or else just left it on the floor altogether!
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|This movie was a disappointment.  It has the wrong title.  It should be &#34;Lincoln and the 13th amendment&#34;.  I (and other individuals) thought the movie was a summary of Lincoln's life (from log cabin to assassination).  For history majors, political science people, or law classes it would make for good class debate, but for the general public it stunk.  This movie concentrated on the ratification of the 13th amendment and the struggles Lincoln and his Republication followers went through to add it to the Constitution.  Wrong title and boring.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Was also great on my home theatre system.<br />The depth of the influence of this band may never be fully known.
B00B6LS9HS|3.0|After I bought the first release from WET, I couldn't wait for the second one.  I am disappointed because the songwriting is just not as good as the first release.  Is it a good album? Yes, it is worth buying.  Rise Up is just not as good as their first album.
B0091XT22O|5.0|Always enjoy watching this one! Streamed great over play station....really want to stay in the hotel the movie was filmed in
B000QY9WOU|5.0|Excellent concert! There was music, costumes, and dancing that made for a very entertaining show.  This is one concert that can't be topped.

B0091P69CI|1.0|I was never able to watch the movie because the service was not able to process my order.  I have seen part of the movie and wanted to watch the rest (and I was willing to pay to watch the entire film...that's how good the part of the movie I saw) of it.  Worth paying for for sure.

B00A6PD9I4|5.0|When do you usually see that? I was really surprised and delighted at the unfolding of this tale, it's unlike any other animated movie<br />I've seen. It didn't go where you expected and was so much more for being unexpected.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just put it in the kindle fire  and love it its big and easy to read and use  and the best thing is it is free
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|This was an interesting movie, if you like action this one is not for you. There is some nudity but it is not the focal point of the movie it is more about the relationship between the main characters...
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a fun horse training game that teaches kids how to manage money and how to care for animals. It is worth the download and it is free so people should get it.<br />Great game
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|I was under the misconception that it was sort of a documentary, but it is fiction. I would have liked it much better had it actually<br />been about scientology.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|I have an i5 lynnfield and for 2-3 years I just used the stock heatsink and fan. I didn't really have too many problems until I started adding more and more to my case. I have a few hard drives, 4 sticks of ram, and two video cards in an eyefinity setup so there isn't a lot of room for air flow and I had to overclock my CPU to get the most out of my ram. Out of curiosity, I downloaded core temp to see how hot my CPU was running. It was idling at 59 C and when gaming it was between 80 and 95!! The CPU auto restarts the PC at 99 C so I knew I was cutting it close.<br /><br />After much research, I went with this product (Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus) for two reasons: Price and efficiency.<br /><br />The instructions were a bit vague at times but the pictures clarified things and even though I had to remove my motherboard to install the mounting bracket, it still only took me about an hour to completely install the heatsink/fan and all my other components (I am a hardware/tech guy though). If your case allows you to access the backside of the motherboard, you won't have to remove it. I booted up just fine and am now idling at 38 C!!! I couldn't be more pleased to see a 20 degree drop right off the bat!<br /><br />My only complaint is that the pictures make it seem like this product comes with 2 fans, one for either side of heatsink. It does comes with the parts to install a secondary one, but it actually only comes with 1 fan. I decided to take a chassis fan off my case and put it on so that I would have two fans on the heatsink and I will order 2 more chassis fans.<br /><br />Overall I am very pleased so far considering how inexpensive this was. Things to keep in mind though: It is really big!! If you have a tiny case or things crowding your CPU, it  may not fit. Also, it is a bit tricky to install and if you aren't accustomed to taking computers apart, you may be a bit overwhelmed.

B007ZXK08C|3.0|clever story line, some well described characters.The story  twisted and turned within the format of the novel which incidently did not lend itself to Kindle comfort. I felt it ran out of steam in a predictable way at the end.
B00766CLPI|2.0|Barbra is definitely not a classical singer.  She hums a lot, at least that's the impression I was left with.  Through her nose, of course.  Sounds more like practice sessions of her vocal chords.  I think her performance, if you can call it that, on this CD has turned me off so I won't get anymore of her CDs.  I thought I liked her voice  but listening to this changes my mind.  Maybe I expected of her what I shouldn't have had on classical pieces.  And she should stick to The Way We Were kind of pop.  Which frankly I've gotten tired of.  On the other hand, if I continue to listen to it, who knows?  It might grow on me the way music on the radio grows on the masses by repetitive hearing.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|he meant the Other Lincoln - LOL - this was great! Why not a vampire hunter? Isn't slavery like vampirism?

0670026603|5.0|A beautiful, heartbreaking love story. The emotional ambience of this novel is on a par with Romeo and Juliet, although the synopsis is nothing like the Bard's homage to the juvenile Verona lovers. In fact, the maturity of both protagonists, the agonizing visceral cognition behind their decisions, makes the novel much deeper and infinitely sadder, closer to the modern reader's core. I don't cry when I watch Romeo and Juliet. I cried when I read this book.<br /><br />The first protagonist, Lou, is a twenty-seven-year-old woman from a poor working family in a small town in England. Single and still living with her parents, without a profession or an ambition, Lou takes a job as a caregiver to a quadriplegic man, Will, a few years older than herself.<br /><br />He couldn't be more unlike her. In his previous life, Will was a brilliant financial shark, handsome, erudite, and wealthy. International deals and extreme sports, risky travels and beautiful women comprised his elite world until two years earlier, when a freak auto accident in front of his home put a rude stop to it all and rendered him totally disabled, dependent on others for everything.<br /><br />The six months Lou and Will spend together, which account for the bulk of the book, force them both to explore each other's social and personal zones. Their mutual emotional journey, from antagonism to acceptance and understanding, widens their horizons, enriches their lives, and irrevocably changes them both. While their two different realms begin to mesh, their souls awaken, blooming into an all-consuming love too late for a happy ending.<br /><br />The author paints vivid pictures of the locations where the action takes place: Lou's shabby home, Will's expensive villa, a tropical island resort; but the appearance of the characters is blurry. Although Lou's propensity for gaudy clothing makes her into a brightly-clad silhouette, I couldn't visualize her face. Neither could I see Will, except for his wheelchair, which defines him. Both protagonists seem ordinary on the surface, but their emotional landscapes are glaringly naked, gripping my heart in the painful clutches of empathy.<br /><br />The novel touches on several topics--family dynamics, class distinctions, hope, and grief--but it concentrates on one controversial theme: euthanasia. When is it allowed? Who makes such a lethal decision? Is love enough to avert the tragic end? Is it a tragic end after all, when life becomes unendurable? Every character in the story faces this dilemma. Everyone has an opinion, and often those opinions clash, adding layers of tension to the story.

Both protagonists seem ordinary on the surface, but their emotional landscapes are glaringly naked, gripping my heart in the painful clutches of empathy.<br /><br />The novel touches on several topics--family dynamics, class distinctions, hope, and grief--but it concentrates on one controversial theme: euthanasia. When is it allowed? Who makes such a lethal decision? Is love enough to avert the tragic end? Is it a tragic end after all, when life becomes unendurable? Every character in the story faces this dilemma. Everyone has an opinion, and often those opinions clash, adding layers of tension to the story.

B0049J2BSM|5.0|the colors, the art, the monsters, the idea of capturing screams as energy - the scene with the conveyer belt-way of doors is mind<br />boggling.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Have really enjoyed this app so far. No liking the adds though.....<br />Graphics are good. Competitions are challenging but fun.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I'm am a huge fan of Dexter. The show is just so creative and unique. I recommend every one to start watching this series. It will not let you down.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|This series has me obsessed.  It's an edge of your seat thriller with every episode!  Once you watch you can't stop
B004UPANAI|5.0|As far as these kinds of movies go, this one works on all levels - story and character development - really peaked my interest -<br />I'd like to see origins for them all. Besides, what's not to like about Hugh Jackman?
1451668945|5.0|Fashion designer Hannah Connelly wants answers when her sister, Kate, is nearly killed in a suspicious explosion at their family's furniture business. But Kate is in the hospital, comatose, so it's up to Hannah to get to the bottom of the mystery. There are plenty of clues and plenty of suspects--and one killer, watching and waiting...<br /><br />Clark has been one of my favorite authors ever since I read her first novel, [[ASIN:B006TQVDIM Where Are the Children?]]. I was in college then, and for nearly 40 years now(!!!) I've looked forward to every new book. I'm a writer, and MHC is one of my inspirations. If you want to know why, try any one of her books, starting with this one. She pretty much created this particular style of domestic thriller, and she continues to be the best of the bunch. In a world of uncertainty, I can always look forward to at least one book a year that I know I'm going to love. Highly recommended.<br /><br />PS: My all-time favorite MHC thrillers are [[ASIN:0671886665 A Cry In The Night]] and [[ASIN:B000FC0RE2 Loves Music, Loves To Dance]], but I'd recommend just about all of them.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|The service was outstanding. I also received my purchase earlier than stated. Great experience and I will definitely use this service again.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|This movie was very good. I was literally on the edge of my seat towards the end. And the production and setting really felt like you were back in that era. It is an overall great movie and I would recommend anyone to see it.
B008I3QZKU|4.0|I love The Killers. The songs on this album are different sounding then their previous albums. They have some serious songs and some fun upbeat ones. Thanks.
B00486070K|3.0|It was working perfectly until about a month or two passed by and it just stopped working. I ordered it in September 2012. and it stopped working around late October, early November.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|Seems like the last couple of episodes became draggy as the fun stuff got pushed to season 3. Dany's story got really strange.
B0031TZ8TU|5.0|Ken Follett is a master story-teller and used his skills well in describing the events surrounding the imprisonment and freedom of two of Ross Perot's employees in an Iranian prison.  Even though we know the outcome, Follett presents the events in such a manner that he definitely holds the reader's attention.  In my opinion, this book helps us better understand the very different mindset of those in charge in Iran today.
0140067477|5.0|This is a great book. I have read this book more than once and could read it over and over again. I recommend this book for anyone seeking guidance and clarity.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|BEST SELF GIFT, I WOULD GIFT THIS TO ALL MY FRIENDS.  AND OR ALL MY FAMILY.  AMAZING TOOL TO RACK THE BRAIN
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|Liked it it was very funny and made me think a lot about things in my own life. I could do without all the cussing though.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I prefer to have the older style 85w charger at home plus this simple adapter so I can charge older macbooks and newer macbooks with a single charger.  I often have friends who come over with laptops and forget their charger.  This is a fantastic way to be able to charge old and the new macbooks.<br /><br />I also use this for the thunderbolt screen I have at home for desktop use while keeping the macbook adapter itself for bedside.<br /><br />The real &#34;magsafe2&#34; power brick is left at work since the work desk is for me and me only  :)
B002NXPTDK|5.0|I would recommend that every young person listen to this album and remember that only you control your happiness. Cudi tells his story over the whole album and many can relate to it
B00006FDCD|5.0|Item received in a timely manner. I first listented to the audible book then watched the movie. I read the book and watched the movie many years ago but I enjoyed it just as much the second time around as the first.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This was a very interesting movie ,I knew that Lincoln had a lot to do with abolishing slavery but I didn't know to what extinct.
B000008LH5|4.0|ten years after were a heavy rockin' protometal blues band. Alvin lee could have gone on to be one of the biggest guitat heroes around but later he went back to a more straight blues rock sound on his own. But here is the band with all of it's power intact. However the songs they played did not due the band justice as they didn't play 'I'd love to change the world' and even when I saw the reformed band they still didn't play that song. Nor did they play incredible jams like '50,000 miles beneath my brain\\" instead it's smokin' hot blues rock mainly. Which is good but not as good as their studio work of the period. still this is a must have for fans of classic fast played rock of the period. And I have all of tya's studio work so I had to grab this and several other live cd's as well.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|This was a lot better than I expected. Yes could be considered a &#34;chick flick&#34; but for this old guy it was engaging and nicely done.
B00AYCOUOG|5.0|This is a great return for Suede. After the first listed I immediately latched on to a few great tracks, but the more I listed the more I like the record from beginning to end. This is a return to the familiar sound more similar to Coming Up.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Well written!  very engaging and outstanding acting--even the wolves!  I would highly recommend.  Can't wait to watch Season 2 and 3.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I bought this CD as a Birthday gift for my husband. He loves it, I love it, the kids love it too. It's nice to hear the songs that have not been aired on the radio
B00BGIBVRG|5.0|It was a great movie. It is definitely worth watching if you enjoyed knocked up... Must see Paul rude an leslie man
B002NOH7G6|3.0|I don't know if this is Amazon or the production company, but the music is SO loud and the speaking is extremely quiet.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I was disappointed about the ongoing ads.  You have to exit the ads continually during the game in order to play.  It's very annoying.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Excellently written, a great spin on the original stories.  The production value is good and the acting is quite good too.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I made myself a bowl of popcorn, sat down in front of my big flat screen and did not get up until the movie was over!
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|In a world where horror movies are as common as mosquitoes, it's nice to see something slightly fresh and actually scary.  This one does a good job.  By the time the movie was over we were checking the window and door locks before bed.
B004T0E2S8|5.0|If you want to know the truth about this app then look no further than this review the price is a little steep but it is very worth it. This app is very easy to understand with very little to think about except which song to play.PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY THIS APP!!!!!
B005HSL626|5.0|It's so easy and fun, my 8 yr old loves to play and is good for hand-eye movement. Good graphics.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Captured my interest from the first page to the last.  Goes back and forth between two timeframes but once you are used to it there is no need to look back.
6304712936|5.0|I had to buy the DVD because my local video store doesn't carry it!  It's an Oscar winning masterpiece about one of the greatest composers in history. Written and acted brilliantly and beautiful to the eye.  My teenager even loved it!  My copy was shipped quickly and was very good quality.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Maybe you should add a random alarm where you can add multiple alarms and one of them would be randomly chosen from the list :D
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Easy at the start, gets increasingly harder. Great mind exercises. For a free app it is worth the time to check it out.
B001DM1VXE|3.0|Reinforces the popular view that to be good at math, you must be mentally ill. I only know of John Nash who fits this description. A Brilliant Mind is a far better film. I am married to a mathematician and he is brilliant and yet well adjusted. No wonder people in this country are afraid of math!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Not your usual Stephen King gore/scare-fest, but still written in his amazing dark,atmospheric style.  Extremely engaging and thoughtful look at the question \\"what if you could change history?\\"  Get it, you won't be disappointed.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Acting was great--moving was amazing especially since it was all based on a true story!  I highly recommend this movie!
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|But the real juice comes from the server ( free ).<br /><br />5 stars for a well polished package. Would like it to be a tad cheaper though.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Normally buy an album for a few good songs, but this one is full of them.  Great song selection and good arrangement from fun and light to slow and heartfelt.  If you're a Blake Shelton fan, it's a no brainer.  Enjoy...it'd sure be cool if you did!
B009MYAQK4|5.0|Words can't explain my thoughts on this amazing book. As a fan of Paulo it didn't surprise me that I read it in 2 days. It's a very profound book and I will read it again.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|the movie zoomed over a lot of stuff. if i didn't already know the story, i wouldn't have understood as well. the book was much better.
B0086700CM|3.0|This game is awesome to start. But when you are farther in the game it starts to go weird. Good enough.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|a must see series if your into vikings.thought out story line.even a cameo by an actor who was in 13 warriors .
B00BP4WAZS|3.0|I enjoyed the movie.  It was worth seeing once, and it is entertaining.  While it's not of the quality of stories like Wall-E or Monsters Inc. I would way it was worth seeing it and time well spent.  It is over hyped and had a lot of marketing behind it.  However, the hype did get me to see the movie and I was not disappointed in it.  Though, I will not watch it again.
B009FZHYKU|1.0|I paid for this episode... at least thats what my credit card says. After waiting 20 minutes for this episode to load, I finally gave up and turned the computer off. Will try again in the near future but this attempt was aFAIL!!!
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I'm a huge DM fan, but would be lying if I said that their last release Sounds of the Universe was anything more than simply dredful...I was NOT a fan of that album. So I was really on the fence about this release. From the first listen I could tell that DM was actually trying some new things that really worked out. The incorporation of blues riffs with the synths is simply amazing. Songs like SLOW and GOODBYE actually seem to breath new life into the mainstay synth work DM is known for.<br /><br />While I did like many of their later albums, Ultra, Exciter and Playing the Angel....although good solid releases, still have sections that seem like filler....I can HONESTLY say this is the most complete album they have done since Songs of Faith and Devotion...EVERY song from start to finish is a very good, enjoyable track.<br /><br />And the lyrics are amazing...My Little Universe congers images of the Big Bang while songs like Sooth My Soul are so odd and off the wall it makes it seem as if Dave Gahan will not rest until he crawls in your window and violently rapes you! lol<br /><br />I honestly did not know if DM were capable of putting together a solid complete \\"classic\\" release this far in their career....and that's not a knock on them, I mean being together for 30+ years, with the natural aging process and the music industry being what it is today...they get credit for simply releasing new material....but to knock one out of the park as if it were 1988....that was plesently unexpected!<br /><br />If you are an old school DM fan that was wondering if they still have it....this album will answer that question with a resounding YES!<br /><br />Go get it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun and very amazing. I say it's worth every penny even though it don't cost anything. It's funny when you get hit by a train, because you get squash ed on the screen. You should try it just once
B00BHMF578|4.0|The story was good and I enjoyed the fact that it was based on real events.  I thought it did a good job setting up the events that lead to the crises where the people needed to be rescued.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I like how everything played out. I felt Sorry for katniss I didn't think that would happen to her. I like the ending I just wish it got more into it. But overall a good read of all three books  I will  be reading them again soon.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This show is hilarious and anyone I know who has ever seen it has nothing bad to say about it. I had seen many episodes of Big Bang and I got the first season as a gift to my boyfriend. We love this show!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I purchased this book after seeing how well the movie did and decided to read the book before watching the DVD.<br />This was definately one of the best written books I have read in a long time.<br />It is captivating, with so much depth and emotion that I found it impossible to put down.<br />It deals with the real issue of mental illness, loss and family dynamics.  I would recommend this book to mature readers who enjoy a serious story line.
B009GEH5NG|5.0|I had an awesome experience while watching this movie on my kindle fire HD.<br />Super clear clarity and surrounding sound.<br />Especially I liked the x-ray feature.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I love how they do the action and the main character is pretty hot! The story line flows very well and keeps me interested as well.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|is there a way to delete some items on the page  Relationships, & other things i didnt download Can you help? seems to make more clutter
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Found myself laughing and crying as I turned the pages.  Was deeply saddened by the content and background of the story (child abuse), but found that the author dealt with it in a realistic way.  Loved the characters and thought the writing was excellent. Would recommend this book to anyone looking for a great read.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|It is challenging, has good graphics and simple, enjoyable game play. The music is unique and gives a good background to the tasks at hand. Recommended as someone who doesn't play many games on my tablet.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My granddaughter and I have watched this at least 5 times and I could watch it again. Steve carell is awesome and the minions are a crack up.  We love this mo ie
B008602KQI|5.0|I really, really liked the characters.  I think the people fit the characters perfectly.<br />I also loved the fact that being a prime member I did not have to pay for it.<br />Thank you...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Good season! I can't wait until season 4 airs! Just keeps getting better and better! I wonder if the governor will survive the 4th season.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|at first it seems fun and enjoyable.  Then you'll. quit because what ever it is you need to do,  you'll. come back and all your land, your new buildings,  all the millions in coins you accumulated lost and your entire army are gone. What the hell GAMELOFT. FIX THE DAMN GAME!!!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Sat down to watch one episode and ended up watching the whole first season.  Extremely well done TV series.  Now time to watch season 2.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Very enlightening & just good. Content was good & Helen Hunt was great. The other acotors wer wonderful also. Good movie.
B00BYOEZTI|5.0|Vary close to the book really enjoyed the movie can't wait till the next movie comes out really enjoyed this movie
B004UNX1LS|2.0|The app crashes within 30 seconds of browsing through the videos on my kindle HD every time. Doesn't crash when watching videos just when browsing.
0316010669|3.0|I am a fan of Gladwell's writing and interviews, I find him fascinating.  I like the way he is able to communicate complex subjects so even not-so-smart people like me can understand.  This book caused me to think about how human beings can make assessments in the blink of an eye.  How many things must fall into place before we make a judgment, how our values, life experiences, etc. all have an effect on how we perceive others.  I liked the book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a very addicting game which is very fun I think that my little<br />cousin who is 6 is even more addicted to It then I am but we both still have time for homework one of the best things about this game is its a never ending game And its amazing quality features. :) ;)
B00013M6NK|1.0|the product send for me not Nikon  and t is difficult to enter the camera and difficult to  go out  so I not trust in it
B005F3GMAO|5.0|Great book for everybody who wants to try live full life.<br /><br />However, when you are reading, you can see and feel the place where the first edition was ended. New chapters (related to the period after year 2000) are not so elaborated and well-thought-out as the beginning of the bio.
B00BF123WG|4.0|We know everything about the plot. What's interesting to watch is Chastain's portrayal of the CIA agent who connected the dots.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|The wonderful reviews of this music have been said in so many ways that I could not add any thing else except.........that it is a masterpiece in and of itself.  Bringing together a group who create such moving musical pieces is breathtaking.  A fantastic CD that I will treasure.....
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I use the alarms for waking up, and timing things in the oven.<br />Like that it displays the outside temp, so now with a glance I know<br />If a need a jacket or not.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|its great I use it for math class everyday. Its so easy to use and has never been weird or acted out. I love it! get it!!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I don't have to have my kindle with me to read the stories or books I bought.. which makes owning a kindle most convenient!
0312380852|5.0|I purchase books that will give me the best assistance possible in my beadwork as I am not in a location to be able to take &#34;hands-on&#34; lessons.  This is definitely one I would recommend to the beginner as well as an intermediate  bead enthusiast.
B0082FPIY8|5.0|I couldn't put this down is the best review I can give. Her epic hike 1100 miles in soaring temperatures with very little money and doing it alone was remarkable. The rawness of her grief was palpable. You are taking the journey with her. It's a very real book. I can't wait to read Torch !
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|The real Justin is back and better than ever I think. This album is easy to listen to and is very catchy too! I snagged it for only $7 so I got a great deal as well!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is challenging and a lot of fun!  The bright colors make the game visually engaging.  Try it!  You won't be disappointed!
B004J4WLB4|3.0|Diffenbaugh uses language very nicely.  However, her storyline as strung out too long.  It was frustrating trying to follow.  Nice wrap up.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|It is a Follett gem, keeping you interested in the lives of it's characters; even though youmay know what will happen historically, each individual's story will keep you enthralled!!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|The early 2 seasons of Fringe are some of my favorite on television. It mixes the tense mystery of Lost with an entertainingly quirky cast (especially John Noble as Walter Bishop) and deals with pseudoscience in a way that makes it engaging, entertaining and enigmatic.<br /><br />JJ Abrams once said that Fringe was his homage to the X-Files, and this first season really feels like a modern reboot of that classic franchise. Every episode is like a thriller or dark mystery movie, with equal parts humor (in most episodes, some don't really have this) mystery and tension.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Can't wait to get each new episode. It took 2 or 3 episodes to really get into it ,but once I did, I can't stop watching it
B001NLKXK2|4.0|This book brings home the tragedy that is Alzheimer's disease, especially poignant when it occurs so early in life and nips the golden years in the bud...realistic, heartbreaking and reflective of what happens to relationships when they can no longer be equally reciprocal....Ann Brown
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Spoilers!  I appreciate that the author had to use her imagination to tell the story from the protagonists point of view, and that it came out seeming very realistic.  I think it definitely brings home the problems particularly associated with early onset Alzheimers.  It seemed that the author's take is similar to mine, in that it's the caregivers this disease is hardest on, speaking strictly psychologically.  It's distressing when your mother (or other relative) no longer recognizes you, but perhaps it is not as distressing to the patient.  To them, you are a smiling stranger, which is probably not so bad.  She also hints at the possibility, which I have often thought about, that the relatives insistence on trying to make the patient remember who they are, is probably more disturbing to the patient than anything else, i.e. &#34;Why does this handsome stranger keep insisting that he's my son?  I know who my son is, and it's not him!&#34;<br /><br />None of us will ever know, or be fully aware, of what it is to have Alzheimers, but this book suggests what it might be like.
B001GA1RFA|3.0|I thought the premise of this book sounded intriguing (plus I have a daughter named Katherine!) but I was disappointed with the story. It lacked depth and focused too much on the main character's &#34;prodigy&#34;. I was bored.
B006BQM762|5.0|very entertaining movie for the whole family!<br />Kept my attention the whole time in,good clean fun movie!<br />Something you could play over and over!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Needs a search. Good selection. Why am I required to do this. This is lame. Oh my gosh. The end.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This is, by far, the most influential book I have read. It is so right on. Sheryl's story compels me to Lean In and support this and the next generation of women in leadership!!!  It made  my best book list - at the top!
B005MMJ84K|5.0|So far this year I've read 2 other dystopian trilogies and they have NOTHING on Lauren Oliver's Delirium Series. She is a phenomenal writer - SO POETIC! Her books are so well written with twists and turns. I think I finished the series in a week, and I was so sad when it was over. Dystopian novels, becoming so popular since the Hunger Games, have disappointed me thus far, but this one was so realistic, could it happen? A MUST READ. Cannot recommend it highly enough.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love it especially since I can read my books that were downloaded to my kindle fire so much easier to read on my android tablet.
B000023YAH|5.0|born to be wild i never know who sang this song but thanks to you i have the cd there are other good songs on this cd also thank you !!

B00AIUUXHC|4.0|It's a great game, and easy to level up to the second shark. After that, you need 6000 coins to level up to the next shark, and a typical 5 or 6 minute round might net you 300 coins. I'm going to keep playing and hope I don't get bored/frustrated before I hit the magic 6000 coin mark.
B009FZHYKU|2.0|Rick went from not crazy to crazy to not crazy, and the Gov went from closet psychopath to outright psychopath, oh and some people died. Not much character or story development. Actually, I started at 3 stars, but after reading this, 2 stars.
B00ATU5JRA|1.0|Does not work.  Can not ready anyhting on the screen that it is dound.  Only good thing it was free.
B009S33I68|4.0|Almost true to the movie, but more definitive. The book names most of the soldiers killed and wounded, More believable.
B00005N5S5|5.0|I can say with confidence that I dislike Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor.  His movies were once really exciting and adrenaline-rushing to watch as a youngster, but nowadays I find them overbearingly cheesy, atrocious from a storyline point of view and somewhat predictably written too.  However... there's always that one exception.  The Terminator *is* that one exception.  The original Terminator (and in fact the entire series) appeals to be in a way where most Arnold movies completely go over my head.  For one thing I suppose I like the entire time travel plotline.  This movie is about a terminator machine from several years into the future sent to destroy a woman by the name Sarah Connor.  However, the character of Michael Biehn is from the future as well and is clearly sent to save Sarah from her termination.  Michael sure has his work cut out for him as far as convincing Sarah he's actually the good guy!  This makes a compelling storyline.<br /><br />The one unusual thing that has stood out to me over the years about this movie is that Arnold plays a bad guy.  Back in the day this was considered an enormous deal and a total surprise to everyone.  Not the same friendly guy we eventually saw in Kindergarten Cop, that's for sure.  Now some aspects of this movie probably haven't dated particularly well such as the segments showing the chaos from the machines going around zapping everything in sight.  It's obvious the machines aren't really there (thank you todays technology for spoiling us!!) and watching them move around is comparable to watching a movie within a movie.  However there's always something to make up for these dated portions (in this case, the one man getting zapped by the walking hunk of destruction and being destroyed before our very eyes, which was reminiscent of a pillow exploding into a pile of feathers- pretty awesome).<br /><br />People don't understand why I love the Terminator so much since I have a history of knocking these type of films.It has to due with my love of science fiction when executed a certain way.  It can't be *too* far-fetched (though truthfully this movie is borderline in that regard) and the story has to unravel in a way that's not confusing.  The Terminator succeeds on both counts.  A very easy to follow storyline without any confusion or question marks at the end- just the way I like it.<br /><br />When it comes down to it, I simply love the feeling of fear when Arnold is marching down the street wielding a couple guns in his destructive search for Sarah Connor, destroying everything in his path.  This is a *wonderful* way to enable my heart to pump with unbelievable nonstop excitement.  I have to laugh however, whenever Arnold imitates the voices of people Sarah's familiar with over the phone.  Seems... really fruity, lol.  By the way, the most frightening part comes when Arnold's machine rises from the fire and walks down the street near the end.  It's freaky because of the way the film is presented during this part.  While unintentional back in 1984 when this movie was released (because the film was undoubtedly considered ahead of its time from a cinematic point of view) nowadays it's just really strange viewing material.  While it's clearly obvious the machine isn't *really* walking down the street, I like the freakiness associated with the machines movements.  It's almost comparable to experiencing an actual nightmare.  It's hard to explain.  It's just really freaking freaky!<br /><br />Overall, a highly recommended film.  Does it hold up well?  YES!  Does it hold up over the years?  YES!  The action -especially Arnold's blaze through the police station- was just unbelievably fun.  A young girl running for her life presents a ton of suspense.  This is how a good action/science fiction should be in my opinion.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Ok, my Logitech G5 began to short out........ so I was on a quest for a replacement.  And, oh what a pain that was to figure out!<br /><br />The feel of this mouse is similar to the G5.  I have large hands, and this feels perfect.  Just enough texture on the surface.  I can rest my hand on the mouse, or claw it when I want to.<br /><br />It looks great... big old Blue anchor on the top.<br /><br />Works with Linux Mint.  No need for drivers.<br /><br />Weighting system.  Usually found in the pricier models.  Braided cord.  My G5 had both and cost about 60% more.<br /><br />Nice price.<br /><br />Sensitivity on the fly.........  side buttons are perfectly placed.<br /><br />What can I say?  This is a great mouse........ Now, it just has to hold up in game play.<br /><br /><<< Update >>><br /><br />I said it works with Linux... yes, it does, however, the software driver that is used for windows to change colors, etc, is not available for Linux.  Maybe I would ding it a half star for that.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|The life of Chris Kyle explained so well. What being a Nave Seal meant and is. Good every day life Seal action to it's finest. RIP Chris.
B00BF123WG|3.0|Nice action scenes but somehow unconvincing. If true, why the sad ending? Another propaganda film. Thanks Hollywood...you're so  darned patriotic.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I am not a huge fan of musicals, but this one made me a believer!  Touching but without sentimentality.  Each character has flaws, and you grow to love even the villians and scoundrels.  Well done.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This show depicts in many ways the old English town vs countryside ways I've read in many an old novel. The characters and more all seem to come to life over time gaining depth and passion. The show also has a Little House on the Prarie feel to it - just not as campy, more adult. I recommend this to anyone who like period shows

0740797719|5.0|First off I must say that I wouldn't rate it a 5.0, but maybe a 4.9 or 4.8. It is definitely not a 4.0, but either way you will find information in this book not published anywhere else. The artwork is beautiful and explained very well in most cases. My only complaint is that while it covers many many different subjects, there is only 1 page on each subject with explanation. It does not go in depth in certain areas, but it has more of a broad knowledge of color. It is worth the money and it is worth reading every chapter word for word even if you feel you know that area very well. Gurney is a very knowledgeable artist and teacher. You are bound to learn amazing things from this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a good game to play with friends. you get bonuses for the runs your friends make. They change the scenery so your dont get bored.

B005DNPKSQ|2.0|The movie itself was great, just like it was 15 years ago! Please tell me why ANY movie worth watching costs money (1.99 or more), and with the prime membership, you only get crap movies that you've never heard of??? I have wasted a half hour at a time looking for ANYTHING remotely watchable with my family with this service. TOPIC FOR DISCUSSION AMAZON: how about paying for newer movies, like if you had to go to the video store, and give those of us that pay you 70 bucks a year for this service a break on movies 5 years or older? Quit trying to squeeze every dollar out of every customer you can in an attempt to satisfy your stock holders, these moves make your company look desperate and heartless, similar to our national airlines now.

B004GTKP3S|5.0|The cast of this reads like a who's who. The acting was fabulous and the story while a little weak at points overall was excellent. It's so nice to watch something on tv that is concerned with quality and not shock value.
B00A6J9SM6|4.0|Bought several books to learn DAX.  This is a superior rendition on the topic, and easy to read.  Will follow up with more detailed comments when I have fully read.  Just cursory read now.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|My wife and I were looking for an interesting series to watch in the evenings on TV and sometimes we even<br />enjoy watching &#34; TV &#34; on our iPad in bed. We generally prefer BBC programs but after watching one or two episodes of &#34; The Good Wife &#34;, we were hooked.<br />The story lines are interesting and the acting is superb. We really enjoy this series and look forward to watching our nightly program. We're on Season one, episode 8 now and it's nice to know that we've got many more episodes to watch. There are four seasons, each with about 22 or 23 episodes each so we're set for awhile. Plus, since we watch the show on our Google TV or iPad, the episodes are in crystal clear HD and our favorite feature, there are NO commercials!!<br />We highly recommend &#34; The Good Wife &#34; to anyone wanting an exciting drama without all of the usual<br />foul language found in many of the programs today. The violence, in our opinion, is kept to a minimum. Check it out, you'll probably like it!<br />Michael and Patricia K.  NJ
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This is the story of Abraham Lincoln the man, not the legend, a who had to do evil to effect a greater good. The movie is thought-provoking, but it's mostly dialogue and diatribe, unlikely to hold your attention if you're looking for action.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love how I can listen to ESPN from different cities. A lot of options and the app works well!
B0062O85IW|5.0|Bought several Walkenback Excel books in the past and he is a good writer on the topic.  Also most impressed that he responded to email.  His writing is clear and to the point.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book had everything I could want in a story. The author captured my attention from page one and kept me engaged and needing to see what would happen with each twist in the story. I closed the book feeling like I had been invited along for dinner with a new friend who exchanged her story in an honest and and compelling way.<br /><br />I am impressed by her fortitude to push forward on a major adventure and am inspired to do more in my own life. An excellent book for anyone looking for great writing and a powerful story.
B004LWZW24|5.0|I liked the movie, it has action, scary parts as well. The only part that I did't care for was when the old lady gat killed by the man.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Makes me cry every time, this movie is really just a treasure and I'll revisit it for years to come.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|The game is fun to play and makes you plan ahead.  But I would have given it a higher score if it didn't freeze up sometimes.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Whilst browsing the Kindle section of Amazon for something different in the sci-fi genre I came across Wool.  Not only was the price appealing but the reviews were great so I decided to give it a go.  I did notice that one reviewer actually had the balls to compare Wool to Hyperion which was what really sparked my interest.  Having read Wool, I now get that comparison.  Wool is brilliantly crafted and the characters are very well developed.  I'll keep this review short and sweet by saying that this stuff is absolutely amazing and you'll be dying to know what's going to happen next with each digital turn of the page.  As far as apocalyptic survival stories go, Wool ranks up there with the best of the best.  MORE PLEASE GOOD SIR!

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I bought this book thinking I would not get into it being about college students, but it grabbed hold and I did not want it to end. Travis and Abby's love story felt realistic in every way. Nothing is better than a book that makes you laugh, cry, love, and scream before it is over. I will definitely be recommending this book to my friends and family.

B00BI73CVI|1.0|How disappointing!!!!  Just putting a lot of big names in a movie does not make it good. However, I thought Anne Hathaway and most of the supporting actors did a great job.
B0066WJLU6|1.0|My Kindle Fire is new and when trying to turn on the flashlight app I repeatedly got told that my camera was in use.  I finally took some photos with my camera to troubleshoot that, indeed, there is nothing wrong with the camera on my Kindle.  I'm also not sure why the flashlight wasn't going to function without my camera - I have found a great free app elsewhere (see all my reviews if you want the one I like).  This app literally doesn't work for me.

B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This is probably the best game on my kindle but I wish you didn't have to get more time. Also it is ridiculous to have to pay 200 game coins to paint your car. Last the cars and the characters are way over priced. Hope creators fix problem. Otherwise very good game.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I love this cd...the music has such a relaxed feeling to you...very relevant...easy going. Pleasantly surprised...easily one of my favs!

B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Daniel Day Lewis definately serves up an A+++ performance. He embodies the 16th pres in a way that only he could. Even the way he walks in this film makes you think that's got to be Ol' honest Abe himself. Excellent supporting cast as well.
B00BF11STU|4.0|A bit slow in places, but overall a good movie. Being in a military family we tend to like movies in that genre. It's a bit heavy in parts as terrorists are interrogated and such...but it is a good movie..

B00BWJARHO|4.0|I waited to see The Hobbit because I heard so many people were disappointed. My lowered expectations made the movie a bit more enjoyable than it probably would have been. An Unexpected Journey covers roughly the first seven chapters of the novel, with some additions, some of which work, some do not. The Pale Orc, The Brown Wizard, while they are colorful additions to the movie don't seem necessary to the story. Tolkien did a wonderful job pacing the book, and all of the changes made to the movie adaptation just seem like a greedy effort to lengthen the stand-alone story to a full trilogy. An Unexpected Journey does not seem to suffer from the corporate desire to stuff their pockets, but I fear for the quality of parts 2 and 3.
B0087EACJK|3.0|This is an okay app, but it just didn't capture my attention. I'm sure that it will be a challenge to many.

B0095ZMMCK|2.0|Without having read whole book.  Had to stop as the supposed brilliant people working in intelligence get taken in too easily and fail to &#34;trust but verify&#34;, walking blindly into antagonist's spin.  Thereby endangering a person they &#34;believe in /love&#34;.  Character ticked me off being so unaware, yet supposed 'rising star&#34;.  Will attempt to re-read at some later date, as these are usually well done books and I may have been in a funk.

0486290492|5.0|I recently finished reading Sense and Sensibility. This book is definitely one of a kind. I have never read anything like it. I plan to eventually read Austen's other books and for them I have high expectations.<br /> I really enjoyed reading this book. I find the love triangles very interesting. I would love to be able to write something like that, with such wit and cleverness. The way Edward betrays Elinor and leads her on I find very cruel. But then I do enjoy when Lucy betrays him for his younger brother. That was definitely entertaining and kept me engaged as I read the novel.<br /> I think my favorite character is Elinor. I can really relate to her. She is very responsible, and I appreciate that and I can understand her better that way. If she would have been more like Marianne, the plot would not have been to my interest at all. So, because Elinor is so responsible and she thinks things through, she and Marianne contrast beautifully.<br /> I do regret when Willoughby marries Miss Grey. But then again, I do really like Colonel Brandon and his sincere affection and love for Marianne. Why did Willoughby have to be so evil? Why couldn't Brandon just not exist and Willoughby and Marianne just live happily ever after? I guess, however, that that would take away as strong essence of the story.<br /> Obviously, I have become very wrapped up in this story as my feelings are so contradictory and indecisive.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|As a huge fan of Lost I can't believe that I never saw Fringe when it was on the air.  JJ Abrahms is fantastic.  I've heard mixed reviews about the rest of the seasons, but the first one was great.  Since I'm a prime member I was able to watch the entire season for free too!  I started watching on my Kindle Fire, but had to switch to TV via my husbands PS3 as he got completely sucked in as well.  We just started the second season and really hope it is as engrossing and entertaining as season 1.  Highly recommend for fans of Lost and The 4400.

B00BJB2C8W|4.0|Tyler, The Creator could easily be the most controversial rapper of late. Never the modest MC, he seems to have an affinity for all things risqu&eacute; an inappropriate, widespread on proper XL debut, 2011's [[ASIN:B004OT7PQU Goblin]].  2013's [[ASIN:B00BJB2C8W Wolf]] continues Tyler, The Creator's glamorization of all things unfiltered, but he sounds less 'raw' and a bit more responsible than he did on Goblin. Wolf still has ample 'colorful' language, but also has its deeper moments (relative's death, a father's abandonment, single parent home, fame issues). Throughout this extremely well produced offering, Tyler the Creator handles production duties.<br /><br />\\"Wolf\\" (an interlude), opens the effort with lush production work featuring piano, strings, and big drums. Tyler expectedly ruins the ambience, glamorizing his beloved f-bomb in repeated fashion and essentially setting the tone for Wolf. On \\"Jamba\\", Tyler's lyrics are brash, often referencing all things inappropriate for conversational purposes. Hodgy Beats (Odd Future) guests on the second verse, reinforcing Tyler's own graphic approach.  \\"Cowboy\\" presents the set's best showing as of yet, sporting production cues characteristic of underground rap track and Tyler's signature production.  The hook itself is addictive (\\"I am the cowboy on my own trip / and I am the cowboy on my own trip...\\"), and Tyler has other highlighting moments including clever line \\"Going hard as riga mo...\\" (referencing rigor mortis).<br /><br />\\"Awkward\\" finds Tyler's bassy vocals chopped and screwed over a slower tempo. Here, Tyler basically depicts the awkwardness of romance, specifically the conceptual storyline throughout Wolf.  First single \\"Domo23\\" is absurd, but the MC at his best. As always, Tyler takes things to the excess with certain references, but that is what he does best.  His `seriousness' is truly affirmed as he pokes fun at his own slogan `wolf gang.' \\"Answer\\" contrasts \\"Domo23\\", showing Tyler in a more serious light discussing his non-existent father and the emotions he felt about that lack of a relationship. He contrasts once more, dropping his newfound seriousness, to discuss his bicycle on \\"Slater\\", featuring Frank Ocean. \\"Slater\\" fits into the conceptual side of Wolf.<br /><br />\\"48\\" plays into constant oscillation of Wolf, dealing with the ills of substance abuse. The most telling, emotional lyric lyric: \\"She could have been a doctor...I'm sorry / could have been an actor and won that Oscar, said I'm sorry...\\" On \\"Colossus\\", Tyler's raps agilely against superb production.  He give a shout-out to his musical idol Pharrell Williams, who actually appears on later track \\"IFHY\\". \\"Partyisntover / Campfire / Bimmer\\" featuring Laetitia Sadier & Frank Ocean is a tree part cut, much like he executed on Goblin. \\"Bimmer\\" of the three parts is the most true to hip-hop.<br /><br />\\"IFHY\\", featuring Pharrell Williams, finds the MC taking a spoken word approach on the first verse. Once he hits the hook, everything evens out.  He raps traditionally from then onward, with Pharrell contributing some lovely vocals near the back half of the five-minute-plus cut.<br />\\"Pigs\\" sounds malicious production-wise, specifically due to the pipe organ-like patch.  Benefiting from a catchy hook, the best line still comes from the third verse: \\"I'm hardly ever angry, Roger Rabbit framed me...\\" \\"Parking Lot\\", featuring Mike G. & Casey Veggies isn't bad, nor elite.  Similarly, \\"Rusty\\", featuring Domo Genesis & Earl Sweatshirt, is solid but not as exceptional as the best.  That said, Tyler gets some jabs in such as \\"See I don't beez in the trap... I beez in the b's...\\" and atheism.<br /><br />\\"Trashwang\\" is among the best, bringing in Tyler's Odd Future.  He contrasts with the jazzy \\"Treehome95\\" (featuring Coco O. & Erykah Badu), which doesn't seem to fit the mode of Wolf at all, even if it is a pleasant, non-explicit cut.  \\"Tamale\\" atones for the explicitness, possessing arguably the album's most infectious groove.  Unfortunately, he goes a bit too far arguably, but that is expected from Tyler.  \\"Lone\\" shows maturity, closing much more thoughtfully than the effort opened and certainly less bold than \\"Tamale\\".<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B00BJB2C8W Wolf]] is a strong and creative effort from Tyler, The Creator.  That said, one who partakes of this album must understand what they are getting with an MC as controversial and bold as Tyler.  This album is not for kids and probably most adults because of the MC's brash and overt rhymes. In the context of his abilities themselves, Tyler is good at what he does.  Art is often polarizing, and Wolf is no exception.oove.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout. It's not long and if you can muscle through the 24 minutes of it, you'll certainly feel it the next day. There are different stages to take you through the 30 day period so you don't get too bored. It is not an easy workout at all. As Jillian says, you can't take it easy and expect results from a 24 minute DVD!

0670026557|5.0|I generally don't enjoy popular-press business books, but this one is spectacular.  When I heard about the book, I thought it was going to be one of those fluffy, feel-good books with no real information.  I was wrong.<br /><br />From the first chapter, I was hooked.  Grant does an excellent job of both combining existing research with real-life business examples.  I will definitely be recommending this book to my friends.

B0094K1WZE|3.0|My husband probably liked it more than I did.  I don't like all of the violence. The picture quality was great using the Kindle connected to our TV.
B00358ESI4|3.0|This is an o.k. movie for those who still like the WWII war movies. I know it's supposed to be a true account of the battle at Ia Drang, but I think it takes to many hollywood liberties. I served in Viet Nam and they missed on some of the requirements for authenticity. Still, it's entertaining and I would watch again.
B008G12ERC|4.0|Personally, I think this wasn't as awesome as the others, but it's still very good. I can't get 'Madness' out of of my head. Love the piano parts and the harmony. Chris' songs were good; nice to hear him up front. Dominic and Matt are awesome as always.
B0067QPVJ6|3.0|Although a prequel to the John Carpenter version of The Thing, this episode falls flat and is not nearly as thrilling nor has nearly as good special effects as the former.  Fair, it is okay but another would be useless.

B00BGIC2J2|3.0|Considering this is a Judd Apatow movie I thought it would be a lot better.  The dialogue between the husband and wife is well written and funny, the rest of the characters are poorly written and over the top, unrealistic.  There are some laughs, but not enough to say so.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This show becomes so much better when you can watch it in bulk.  Also, the Blu-Rays have some great features.  For somebody that hasn't read all the books yet, and is farily new to the series, the extras provide a lot of great background information.  The in-episode guides are great for getting to know the history of the characters and places.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|What a joy it is to wake up to a song I choose.  The clock itself is easy to use and read.  A great ap.
B000GOWNPU|1.0|Sad to see Brad Pitt mouthing such un-American, un-patriotic b.s. Not entertaining. Also seeing the sorry drunk in it spewing hatred of women. Trash.
B000QCS9NM|3.0|A lot of medical terms made this book fairly annoying having to stop and look it up to understand.Some awesome moments and twists. But no real plot. Not bad but not memorable.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Really enjoyed this book the authors descriptions formed perfect pictures in my mind. I am taking care of my mom and the description was painfully real.
B008HK3XYK|4.0|Works very well. Automatically turns off the Kindle when closed and turns it back on when you open it. Nice looking and easy to install.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|This was classic Jeffrey Archer. I enjoyed the book as much as the previous 2 and I was hooked from the first page.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|You get go out in a car in you really can catch rare an<br />malies. If you dont like it you have to crazy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read all three books in this series.  This one was very good. Not sure they can<br />make a movie.  All in all the book was very good.
B005ISQ7JM|4.0|Good explanation of what HTML5 is not how to use it. I read it a couple of times to get all the details.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I chose this rating because the book is well written and I love the story to it.  I love how all of it ties together in the end and it has a happy ending. This book kept me on the edge of my seat and I couldn't put it down. It was great and I recommend this book to teens. Boys and girls. And young adults. I love how Colleen Hoover writes. Great book!
B000AM2L1O|4.0|It has a nice feel/weight to it, and looks adorable.  The only thing is that it is small.  Not smaller than the description, just that  you don't realize till you get it how small it is.  Other than that, it's a great item.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I purchased the first two seasons and decided I needed to have the third one available for watching on my Kindle Fire. I love this series from the perspective of interesting relationships between characters, good character development, surprising twists in the plot, and the historical aspects of it. It brings alive the people of a bygone era and makes them real. No one is perfect or always right- just as in real life. But, their stories are sometimes romantic, sometimes funny, sometimes sad. These characters feel real.<br /><br />I've had friends who didn't consider themselves to be fans of period dramas to really enjoy this series.  It's just something special in the world of television.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|What a cute sad little face.  However, it is fun to play with little kitty during a break at work. If you give it a name the fun is even greater.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I bought this for my wife. she has watched all of it several times. arrived quickly and was exactly as described.
B002ZG9774|5.0|I enjoyed this movie when we viewed it on DISH network.  I didn't realize it at the time, but one of my favorite people starred in it - Julianne Hough.  I had to buy the movie and watch it again.  I have enjoyed it tremendously.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I liked that with Amazon Prime I could watch the entire 2nd season before it aired in the US. The price was right, too.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|This free GB gives you tome to see what all you can do with Amazon.  Keep it going.  It's good advertizing.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This was a good book, really VERY good for the first 3/4 of the book, then all of the sudden it was like the author decided &#34;uh oh, I only have 20 pages left, better end things&#34; and did just that. There was lots of detail and interesting things happening, then suddenly it was like &#34;all done&#34; several issues were never solved and lots of stuff was just left hanging. Still recommend it, just know that you might not be satisfied with the way it ends.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Dan Pink's writing is fun and engaging, and in this book, as in his previous book Drive, you can use his advice right away. He has a theory about how selling has changed in our world of more-or-less complete information, and how we all are selling nowadays, and he gives specific tools and techniques to help us do it better. And all in the interest of what it comes down to in the end - will the buyer be better off by buying, and will the world be a better place? Powerful questions to ask, especially if you can answer &#34;Yes!&#34;
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|Need I say more . . . I've been listening to Whitney for many years.  Her music brought back many good memories of the 80s to me.  I was happy to find this collection on the internet.  I wasn't happy how she passed away though.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This book kept me interested and when the mystery untangle, it wasn't what I expected.  Not sure I liked the ending though.
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|This album is considerably different than their previous albums - Not in a bad way, just different. I actually really love all of the songs!
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I don't listen to this type music. but my little girl wanted it pretty bad and I just couldn't say no. 5 stars from my baby girl. no stars from me
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Love this movie, ordered it before it was out, however shipping took forever and i missed getting my pre order code, thankfully i still got to watch the live event, but not becasue of this
B000Q67876|5.0|I'm a sucker for nice packaging and this is no exception.  Warner Bros.' Digibooks are always nice to look at: this has a nice matter finish, relatively slim profile and nice paper stock.  The printed information (photos, cast bios, etc.) isn't anything special but it's designed attractively.  Of course the movie and Blu-ray presentation is top-notch...and if you don't care about packaging, just opt for the regular edition.  But if you're like me and love attractive packaging too, you won't be disappointed.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I love the selection of songs on this CD, but most of all I truly love and admire Andrea Bocelli's amazing voice!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it on my laptop, on my tablet, on my phone. It use it here, I use it there, I use it everywhere. Great family of plug-ins as well. Solid easy to use and reliable. The notes by mail feature is very useful.
B00846REIS|5.0|thanks you very much Item came in on time and better than i expected! i will use seller again !
B00AJER3SE|3.0|I wouldn't doubt that casual movie fans even would even know the difference between this release and the original and digibook edition Blu-rays, but this 2013 release includes the same excellent remaster featured on the recent Region B release.  The color timing leans towards blue/teal, but that doesn't bother me at all.  I'd love to have the original mono mix and all the original DVD extras (this release omits quite a few, and only features the so-so 5.1 remix.  It's not a definitive release by any means but worth the price if you're just looking for solid picture quality.
B00136JS12|5.0|every song is a classic<br />(i don't need more words than that, but this review apparently requires it...three more words)
B007ZI06FE|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this book. It came highly recommended from Anne from over at Under the Covers Book Blog and I have to say she has not steered me wrong yet. I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. I've never really read Steampunk before, so I wasn't sure what it would be all about and I'm still not entirely sure what is so different about it besides the mention of clockwork mechanical automations, which isn't something what would be so out of the ordinary for a paranormal read to begin with, so as far as the steampunk aspect goes it was barely noticeable.  The world building is impressive. This new world is a lot to take on and it can at times get overwhelming but in the end you have a complete new world that has been entirely set up for the entire series.  This is a historical with a paranormal twist.<br /><br />I adored Honoria and Blade as a couple, the sexual tension was of the chains. Honoria has been taking care of her siblings for the past 6 months. Her entire world exists to take care of them.  She is slowly killing herself to make ends meet, when the call comes.  Blade is the Monster of Whitechapel, she thought she needed to escape his notice, she never thought he would end up being her salvation.  Blade is intrigued by Honoria from the start. Her pride will be the death of her, but she still keeps on keeping on.  Her strength of heart and her beauty keep blade coming back. He knows he wants her he's just not sure what to do with her. LOL Every time they get near each other the sexual tension is bursting from the pages! It makes things interesting for us readers. I enjoyed watching their romance develop.<br /><br />As individual characters I loved both Honor and Blade. Honor is a strong character; everything she does is for her siblings. She sacrifices everything for them, her health, her pride and her blood. I can get down with that. She is also very brave and does not shy away from doing what she needs to do, at times it can be heartbreaking.  Blade, aw man, I love a bad guy that is actually the good guy. He cannot be seen as weak and the leader of the Rookeries. When the big bad comes to his territory it is up to him to take of it and he does not shy away from his duty. He knows he is on the edge, soon his time will be up and he'll have to do, what needs to be done. He just wishes he could have met Honor before he got so close to the edge. He wants more than a couple of months with her and his adopted family. A monster to the rest but to his family and Honor they know the good man he is beneath.<br /><br />This was a great start to this new series. I am looking forward to the rest of the books and have already put a dent in the series. I see good things to come.<br /><br />Rating: 4.5eaking.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|thanks you very much Item came in on time and better than i expected! i will use seller again !
B006JTS5OO|4.0|I liked this movie, but I'm writing this review to inform future buyers that the Soundtrack is no longer available to download. Disney pulled the download link off of their website, so if someone was planning on buying either of the two versions that include the soundtrack, you're probably wasting your money. At this time, the soundtrack versions are a much higher price than the non-soundtrack DVDs and that price difference seems to be for the soundtrack and digital copy. So with the soundtrack link gone, the extra costs are just for the digital copy, which definitely isn't worth it at the current prices (in my opinion).
B007SGLZP8|4.0|After his initial success, John Grisham books became rote, predictable and boring..  This is a return to his earlier, and better writing.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|The movie had to be rebooted three times before it worked right, and I refuse to listen to that much cussing.  Only watched a little over an hour of it.  Would like a refund!
B004IOVGW0|5.0|great music<br /><br />great plot<br /><br />Novak is beautiful<br /><br />Holden is perfect for his role.<br /><br />Looks like it was filmed on location<br /><br />Definitely one of my top 10 all time favorites
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game, my grand kids loved it too! Especially the sound effects, and buying shark accessories. Love it
