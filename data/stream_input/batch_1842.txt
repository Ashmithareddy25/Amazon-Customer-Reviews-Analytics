B000FC12SM|5.0|Read this book a long time ago. It was helpful then and even more so now. Good to be reminded that we are different.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Best Series ever - Story line, special effects and cast keep you coming back for more. Hope it never ends
0143119680|5.0|Diana is a 30-something witch. We're speaking literally here. The woman is brilliant (it really helps that the AUTHOR is brilliant because the intelligence really translates), of decent good looks, and of a mind set that includes \\"I am queen over my own life, body, and mind\\".<br /><br />She's a human-wanna-be. She won't use her magic. Period. She wants a normal life with no magical ties. Why? Because her parents were brutally murdered when she was 7 years old, and she grew knowing that magic was the reason they were taken from her.<br /><br />So she contents herself with the dull routines of life, throwing herself into academics to become a professor of alchemical history.<br /><br />But, oops! Diana is exceptionally powerful, and she's leaking magic. And... another big oops here... she unwittingly calls up a manuscript that hasn't been seen in hundreds of years that is said to hold the key to \\"creature\\" creation. Think The Origin of Species for paranormal beings.<br /><br />Now everyone's eyes are on her, including those of a handsome, ancient, vampire named Matthew.<br /><br />Matthew's got a few things going for him (okay, try everything) but he's SOL in love. When he joins the band to meet Diana and find out about the Manuscript he ends up with more than he bargained for in the feelings department.<br /><br />Now they're on a quest to get their hands on the manuscript before anyone else and they've got an army from all sides after them because of their involvement with each other. Apparently Witches and Vampires are never supposed to mix. It's socially taboo.<br />This book is full of history, random/obscure knoweldge about pretty much everything, a fantastic romance, a great moral about love crossing all boundaries, and finally a masterfully developed plot line that keeps you turning the pages.<br /><br />The characters are colorful and tangible. In the nearly 600 pages of this book, the reader will REALLY get to know Diana, Matthew, and the slew of family and friends that gather to stand up for them against the face of an impossible enemy... prejudice.<br /><br />I found myself reading and rereading the paragrahps because there was so much going on in each and every little exchange. Gobs of information is present in pretty much every corner of the story and the exchanges between characters are often so erudite that I have to take a moment to absorb everything being said.<br /><br />That, however, is not a negative to this work. The presentation of all of this information doesn't make the author come off pretentious at all. I get involved in the learning, and the knowing, and the discovering the story through references to historical figures that I had no idea existed.<br /><br />The philosophy and psychology in this book are also phenomenal. \\"Group Think\\" is touched upon, along with the concept of ancient laws still governing modern people-groups.<br /><br />This would be such an incredible book for a book-club, especially one that is very discussion oriented because I believe that there's a lot there in the work that can't be drawn out just from reading it to yourself. I wish I had the opportunity to really sit down with another reader and hash out all of the intricacies of this work.<br /><br />It may have vampires and witches in it.... and it may contain a lot of the romance novel aspects... but GEEZ is it a treasure trove of discussion topics!<br /><br />I desperately adore this book and I'm on the waiting list to get the second book in the trilogy, \\"Shadow of Night\\", at my local Library.<br /><br />Part history book, paranormal field guide, romance, and mystery this book will appeal to a vast number of people.<br /><br />Maybe you!friends that gather to stand up for them against the face of an impossible enemy... prejudice.<br /><br />I found myself reading and rereading the paragrahps because there was so much going on in each and every little exchange.

B007KZY1YY|3.0|Book was very easy to read but for me it got tiresome after a while as some parts kept repeating itself. As well as I did not like how the main characters were shown.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I love this show and only started watching it this season.  Since I missed so many seasons, I had to start buying them.  It's, by far, one of the funniest sit-coms I've ever seen.  Sheldon is Hilarious!!!!!
B004SBBDB2|5.0|The right one the color tips help out  a great deal easy to use and hook up. It did what it supposd to do?
B000W91RUG|5.0|This is where it all began...the beginning of the funniest sit-coms I've ever seen!!!  I'm looking forward to catching up on all the seasons I've missed since I just started watching it this season.
0898159156|5.0|The book was in great shape clean pages not wrote on and it was what I was looking for. No writing at all on the pages.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It's a twisted, yet intriguing story about two people falling in love and conquering their personal &#34;demons&#34;.<br />Sexy and sweet at the same time.
B0027BVMSY|3.0|Watched this a week after Casino Royale and its plot still made little sense to me (its a sequel to CR). Couldn't get into the characters. Bond's \\"rogue\\" status didn't seem much different than how he acted in CR. We didn't get any Bond toys. There was some intense hand to hand battles which surely was inspired by the Bourne series (same as in CR). Overall very forgettable.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|love this movie- purchased it for my godson as a christmas gift.<br />Couldn't beat the price, compared with the stores this price was a steal.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the best season yet and it's not done.  This season has made you love our group even more and really dislike some new characters.  I can't wait for the season to start back up in the New Year.
B00A0SMTXS|4.0|Really like this movie.  There are a number of scenes that will bring back all those fond moments from the original.  Great action scenes, decent story.  If you're in the mood for an action movie, then you'll enjoy Total Recall.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I absolutely gobble up any Michael Connelly book, and this on is no exception.  You always wonder what's next in the book
B007ADIRDM|5.0|My Granddaughter is going to love this, as I have looked it over, I'm sure she will enjoy playing with it.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Purchased from IB3 LLC in Villa Rica Ga on Amazon and it appears to be counterfeit. Front screen separated once phone was gently installed.
B00633W614|4.0|I very much enjoy the writing of Jeffrey Archer.  This book didn't disappoint me.  Enjoyed the characters and look forward to the next in the series.
B00AC8ZJPQ|1.0|I'm a sci-fi lover, but this one sucked.  It had poor audio and was difficult to follow, and what I could follow was boring.  Starship troopers #1 is better
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Tgraphics are great and I am loving the interaction with the monkey . You guys just keep getting better and better Way to go!!!
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Hands down (or 2 thumbs up!) best movie I've seen in a long LONG time!!!  I passed it over several times just because of the title, but after a friend recommended it, I thought I'd give it a shot.  WOW!  Well acted, lots of edge-of-the-seat action, several jump-back moments ~ just a danged good movie all around!!!  Watched it twice in 24 hours - I will definately be purchasing this DVD!!!
B001AQR3JY|4.0|This is my first time seeing the Lion King. I never thought it was interesting but ive always wanted to see the play on Broadway. Therefore i thought id watch it first. It was great but not what i expected. I thought it would have more of a dramatic ending revengeful ending but my kids enjoyed and it will be a classic in our home for years to come! Afterall, its still a great message

Their mom loses her pregnancies from these physical abuse, Jaja ends up with a deformed finger for not placing first in his catechism class while Kambili's growth is stunted psychologically and she is mistakenly labelled in school, a backyard snob.

Interesting and deep novel.the society through demonstration.<br /><br />Interesting and deep novel.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|This is one of the best movies especially at Christmas. Miracle on 34th street is one of my favorites. also like the other Miracle On 34th Street.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|my fav tv show, thought season 1 and 2 were better, many of the prison scenes were graphically dark, all of the gore and killing is fun but lets do it where we can see some scenery!
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|This was a very compelling book to read. I couldnt keep it down till I finished the whole book. The reader will definitely be able to relate himself or herself to the real life examples mentioned in this book. This book gives one the revelation that the difficulties or challenges one faces in life are definitely far more better than the concentration camp experiences of the author and it gives one the confidence to face and overcome any situation successfully in life provided one has found the true meaning of his life. A must read book for all!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is an awesome, original tale.  Loved it from the beginning.  And have now bought others by this author.  Two young would-be lovers, who are facing their own mortality.  Incredible story, very satisfying read!
B004FOA84A|3.0|It will be fun when I figure out how to get what I need to progress. Needs hints. Nice graphics.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|The TED lectures are short, sometimes funny, with speakers from all over the globe.  Pick a topic, any topic - and you will find something fascinating to listen to.  LOVE IT!!
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|very beautiful movie....it keeps my kiddos entertained for a while....but I will really have more options of xmas movies....that shows the real meaning of xmas time.....THE BIRTHDAY OF OUR SAVIOR .....LORD JESUS CHRIST!!!!!  in a kiddos format....si the can understand better the meaning of xmas!!!!
B0011EU0NG|5.0|I bought this for a Christmas gift and I got it for a great price. my girlfriend is the one that wanted this movie .
B000V63BN6|5.0|My wife loves 50,60,and70 music. so I got this for her as a stocking stuffer. I'm more of a progressive rock and metal fan myself,but i know everything i love has its roots in the 60 s and 70s. so it was no real surprise that i knew and liked some of  this,what was is that out of 21 songs i could sing along with 19 of them . songs like superstition, higher ground, living for the city and you haven't done nothin, are among my favorite songs .... I consider myself a collector of music with a really good collection of music over 1000 cds and if you add in the vinyl, cassettes and yes the 8 tracks over 1500 ,but to have NO Stevie Wonder is not acceptable. This is a great collection of Mr. Wonders music that my wife will not part with. so I WILL buy it again and add to my collection.  This is a MUST HAVE for anybody , a collector,or someone who just likes good music. So don't think about it just get it, take it from Vinny the old hippy who once again has a good collection of music,made just a little bit better by adding this.<br /><br />  VJPTHE2ND
B002SSUQFG|1.0|The automatic Seiko simply did not work!!! The \\"start up\\" cycle had to be initiated<br />many times just to have the watch keep correct time for a few hours. The mechanism<br />had to be faulty!
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|It was about as good as I expected. Pretty funny if you like Seth McFarland (which if you don't then don't rent this movie). Some slow parts but the majority of it is funny.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I had low expectations after the debacle that was season 2. The show has finally found it's focus and really developed into something special. You can believe the actions that these characters are taking, and nothing feels forced.<br /><br />As far as the quality of the video, I have found it to be remarkably clear. The encoding is solid and there are very few recording artifacts. All in all, worth the purchase price.
B0090EHVMC|1.0|The movie portrays corporations as evil destroyers.  You'll have to deprogram your kids if you let them watch this.  I wish adults would leave politics to adults.  It's a cute fun movie but the message in the movie isn't worth exposing your children to unless you are a committed leftist.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Too Short, not his best story but it's better than most other stuff like this.<br />Still a connelly fan tho
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|This movie was pretty solid. I don't think it quite filled all of the hype, but I was laughing a lot during the 107 minutes. If it's been a while since you've really enjoyed a good comedy (like since Step Brothers or something similar), I'd suggest renting or buying Ted.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! It was such a good book, one of the best series I have read!  Would recomend this to anyone!
B002XXLKHY|5.0|Elf is by far the best Christmas movie, especially if you're a fan of comedies. If for some reason you've never seen it before, pick it up right now. It'll put you in the Christmas spirit!
030758836X|3.0|Yes it's a good story and if you need some good entertainment this is it.<br /><br />But I couldn't help thinking throughout the story what an Idiot the husband is. The ending, while unconvincing and made me think the author also wanted to get the story over with, was disappointing.<br /><br />Worth the read, but I wish it would have ended with the husband showing some intelligence and a backbone.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|There are definitely some very funny parts in this movie.  I was worried that they showed all of the funny parts in the previews, but that not the case.  The unrated version is the way to go for a few extra laughs.  I had very high expectatoins coming into it, and it held up to it for the most part.  After I watch it a few more times I would probably end up giving it 5 stars.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Really love this book.  Sylvia Day is a fantastic writer and I love the story line of Eva and Gideon.  It draws you in so quickly to their lives... their pasts and what the future is to bring for these two.  I wasn't expecting how this second book ended and can't wait for the next one.  My only complaint... these books are too short!!  It likes just a few hours to read them... not nearly long enough Sylvia!  You just want to read forever about these characters!
B0011ZRSTO|5.0|To me this is the ultimate release by Obituary. I first saw them live on this tour and was just astonished- they were with Death and Sepultura I think (don't quote me on that- it's been 20+ years) but I remember they opened the show and totally demolished any band that played that night.<br /><br />I made a slight mistake on this purchase in that I didn't realize a portion of the tracks were earlier versions of the songs. Even though it's cool to have those earlier versions I was trying to replace the original tracks on my iPod because they were of substandard sound quality (they were transferred from vinyl to my pc to my iPod and lost some of the original quality). It would have been perfect if each of those earlier version tracks also had the original along with it. That's my mistake though so I will see about finding and purchasing them from another release.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a really neat app!  I loved putting puzzles together as a kid and now you don't have to worry about losing any of the pieces or having a place to put your puzzle together.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|This a really great book about social and political life in 19th-century France. I would not dare to compare Hugo with Dickens, but somehow that idea might creep into the mind of the reader. The story is poignant, dramatic, raising some important ethical and universal questions on human development and societal justice. Hugo's talent is undeniable, although his narrative may be classified as a bit historically slanted, allegedly. The English version is worth applauding indeed, as it reveals the challenges of interpreting from French; whereas both languages boast their long history, a lot in common in terms of Latin origin, notwithstanding their own unique development and evolvement. For a linguistic researcher, such parallels need noting.
1451695187|5.0|I loved this book and wanted to know more. I hope Dr. Alexander does a book tour, I would love to hear him speak about his experience.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This show just keeps getting better!  Before I even gave it a chance, I thought I would not enjoy it because I'm not into zombies.  However, I am now addicted.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Good action sequences, but with a weak storyline. Not as engaging as the other Bourne movies. A good pass time movie though
B0017VQB40|5.0|Wonderful music and dancing. A true classic. This movie should be part of everyone's collection. Leonard Bernstein at his best.
B00899DR40|5.0|I only purchased this album for my daughters, but I now find myself listening to it when they're not in the car. Great music!
B008476HBM|5.0|I wanted to read a classic and with my new Kindle Fire, I did just that.  I enjoyed the story and will read more by Jane Austen.
B004J1DBJI|1.0|I can't believe that the latest version of the app, 1.2.0.3888710, requires me to login to the Amazon Appstore before I can use it!
B005IQZB14|4.0|Interesting experiences on a trail I know little about.  Easy read; it  keeps your interest plus I like true stories.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Not as many laughs as I hoped for. Worth renting but not owning. Once again the best scenes were on the trailers.
B006RUJST6|5.0|slammed, by colleen hoover, is a wonderful great book. i have read it twice already, great writer! love the book
B0017SWPXY|4.0|For those of us who believe that dogs truly do have feelings, this was such a sweet story.  It made me cry and smile several times throughout the story.  The story refers to racing through the entire book, which I thought I would not like, but it was done so well I truly enjoyed it.  I have referred this book to all my friends who love dogs.
B0055PMJMW|5.0|suicide run, three harry bosch stories. i ordered it on my kindle. i love this writer,  michael connelly. have not read it yet
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Dickens is fantastic. This is a great book for getting into the Christmas spirit. The kindle edition was packaged well; I have no complaints. God bless us, everyone!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I've always loved Ken Follett's books and this is no exception.  It grabbed me from the start and kept me enthralled throughout. Can't wait to start book 2!
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Its avery good book and i totally recommend it. Although some of the grammer is confusing the overall quality of the book is five stars. I havnt read white fang yet but i hear its great to. Cheers to Jack London!!!
B00632HWOG|1.0|I recently received an update for the Yahoo mail app. I okayed it. The problem I'm having is that it keeps loading for my inbox and my inbox doesn't show at all. Today I clicked on the app and a message came up to force close this app. The company  that sent this new version should take out all the bugs and defects, so that everyone who uses the Yahoo mail app on a daily basis won't have any problems, like they are having right now. Fix it first before sending it out for everyone.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|I am not a fan of classics or love stories, but i could not put this down. It is a must read.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|A good movie to fold laundry to or wash the dishes or clean the bathroom or make the beds or have on in the background while vacuuming.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|Great game, my 4 year old son loves it as do I, only negative is that it gets a bit too difficult for him, even for me at times but it's still a great challenge.<br />LO
B0084U0IEG|3.0|After loving Atonement, On Chesil Beach, and Black Dogs, I was looking forward to Sweet Tooth, even though the title didn't captivate me. I'm about half-way through and find it very easy to pick up this book to read, and equally easy to put it down.  I feel removed from the characters, even though certain passages resonate.  Maybe it gets better??  At the rate I'm going with the book, we'll know in about a month.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I sadly watched the movie before reading the book but I'm still not disappointed. She is such a great writer. Can't wait to start the next one
B008JGSM6G|5.0|my boyfriend AND my 5 year old both enjoy this game equally!! jit is a great app to work your brain !
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a riveting book that keeps you wanting more.  I would recommend this book to anyone.<br /><br />Dddavidson@hotmail
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|I can't wait to start book 3!!  Book 2 really through me for a twist as it didn't unfold the way I expected at all!!  Awesome!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Without question, this is the best show on tv in my opinion. I can't wait until the mid-season break is over!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This free game can be played while watching TV or talking, texting on the phone thatis why I like this game.
B009RI4ZKC|3.0|This was an ok movie. The characters were well acted by a great cast but the movie never rose to the level of the hype.<br />The script was just so so. It felt like eating a meal and feeling hungry immediately after.<br />It tried to be off beat and quirky and fell flat on both counts.<br />Wait for it on TV.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|The best games on the Kindel are the Angry Birds. This is very addicting though. Glad they have some on the free games.I dont,t like the ads wanting you to purchase  different games ,
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Makes you determined to pursue joy in your life, and an absolute evening of fun inspired by this story!  The acting is uplifting.  A movie to share with others.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Best one yet!!  Could not put it down. Can't wait for the next challenge for Mitch Rapp.  I trust there are lots of good guys out there watching out for us.
0743270754|4.0|Good book, well-written, although I am not a Civil War buff. However, a different angle is always welcome. A bit tiresome at mid-point.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|After I read the reviews and was sucked into the buzz, I had fairly decent expectations for this movie but honestly was disappointed. I was expecting them to take better care with the franchise then to have a really loose tie-in with another agent who was on the hunt for some pills(?) Yes. That was literally the plot. Finding pills. There was no main action set piece and it was just muddled throughout. I thought Skyfall was better than this and that was -eh- as well.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Building on the gameplay and puzzle elements of 'Where's My Water?', Where's My Perry adds somewhat more of a story element and some voice dialog. The actually gameplay is pretty similar to 'Where's My Water?' but with some new level features and gameplay mechanics. If you're a fan of 'Where's My Water?' then you'll love this too.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|I am still reading - excellent historical account of Lincoln and his rivals/friends/admirers.  Am learning so much about that period and the republican party of that time.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|UPDATE:  December 23, 2012  I received follow-up email from the company advising me that the product had been updated and released.  I was happy to check out the free version and then re-purchased the premium product.  They have got it right this time.  There are no loop errors and even more sounds available than in the original product. As I noted in my first review, the concept of this product is great, the layout is attractive, and it's intuitive and fun to use.  Kudos on the new release!
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|This was such fun and the kind that I couldn't stop until I was successful.  The only problem I had was trying to use the map.  Each time I would click on it, it would throw me out of the game.  I just quit going to the map. I would love to see more games like this.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|I was watching this in the basement on a 23 inch television, and I thought it looks just fine, but didn't see what the fuss was about. Then in the scenes where Lawrence was crossing the desert for the first time, I moved up to 2-3 feet from the set, and it was like looking in to another world. I don't have to say that this is one of the greatest films ever made, with spot-on acting. In these days of low attention spans, there will never again be a movie that takes its time like this one does. The coffee table book is completely original and beautiful to look at. I will savor the added disks for months to come.
B00AE2I4WK|3.0|The movie was really good. A lot of dancing which is nice to see. Quality of the movie not to much.
B009ZQJVAK|5.0|My 30 year old granddaughter told me about it and we both enjoyed watching it together. It was a fun movie. My Husband and I plan to watch it together some time this month.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book was very good to read. I read it twice. I enjoyed the emotions part of the book the best.
B004G600A4|5.0|Kids love the movie, and it is a good enough story not to bore the adults to sleep.  Would recommend.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I'm only half thru the book but Clancy is showing his normal brilliance.  The cyber-hacking is a bit creepy, but is likely occurring as we speak.  If you like smart thrillers, you'll love this book.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Very funny with a sweet story.  Our whole family from 4 year old to almost 40 really enjoyed watching this movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|\\"The sky is always beautiful. Even when it's dark or rainy or cloudy, it's still beautiful to look at\\"<br /><br />I have read over 200 books this year including Slammed and Point of Retreat by Colleen Hoover and I must say that Hopeless is one of my top books of 2012. It is so heartbreakingly beautiful and I simply could not have loved Sky and Holder any more. Their story was so intense and real, raw and full of emotion.<br /><br />There is nothing I can really say about this book as it has left me speechless and I am still reeling from this experience. I encourage everything to read this book and see (feel) what I am not able to express.<br /><br />\\"he slides his fingers down my arm until he finds my pinky, then wraps his around it. It's an extremely small gesture, but he couldn't have done anything more perfect to fill me with the sense of security that I need from him right now\\"
1423124111|5.0|Great art work. Interesting history of some of the art that we see when moving through Disney Parks. Nicely printed. A little odd size book, but love it.
1475143389|5.0|Very easy to understand. I will be implementing all of this into my diet and weightlifting routine. It's hard to find a routine that works for yourself sometimes, but this seems like one that will work for me.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|This is a funny and smartly-written movie. I laughed so hard I cried at parts. The pacing can be uneven at times, but I love the use of classic characters in modern sitting. Some absurd scenes at times. I watch it regularly, especially when I need a pick-me-up.
B006LSZECO|5.0|lots of twists and turns; tough to put down.  sort of a mystery, wrapped in a mystery, cloaked in a mystery
B006ZZANG0|5.0|A must have cd, Rufus does it again, a great mixture of music. He has the most awesome smooth voice and a great musician. And the photos are great. Love his cheeky wit, he is a wonderful entertainer.  I could listen over and over.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Amazing book!! Definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat through out the whole book! Can't wait to read part 3
B00A2BTCTC|5.0|Just received the Blu-Ray disk. WOW!  I'm speechless. The sound is outstanding. It's like hearing 2112 for the first time all over again.
B008YWY0HK|3.0|Pacakge came in time, I was able to purchase this cheaper here on Amazon than anywhere else, although I would've been happy to pay anything for my Baby Girls happiness. I'm sure she'll love it, can't wait till Chritmas!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Weird movie but i love the main cast. This was a boys film I'm sure men would like it more than women. The bears character was a little unlikeable until the very end. It was an ok movie with some vert funny parts!
B005IQ39AY|2.0|I would attempt to shot the bubble in to the playing field and 2 times out of 5 it would not move. I have other games vary similar and do not have any problems with them so I do not believe it has anything to do with my finger movement or my device.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good game.  Wish you did not have to up levels to get more diamonds. I don't pay for things in games.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|As someone who uses Facebook extensively to keep in touch with family and friends, what can I say that hasn't been said by many reviewers about this??? Fix the darn thing already!!!
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|it's a good movie but fails to live upto the previous 2 movies, if your a big fan it is a must see.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|streaming was terrible. both times we tried to watch it, during the first several hours after renting, the movie would pause and take forever to reload. and no, it's not my internet connection.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My kids love this movie (2yo and 4yo)  They watch it often!  No problems with sound, picture etc... happy with purchase
B002VHI8J0|1.0|Could not go past the first page, did not figure out how to return a kindle book so i am stuck with it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I think the presentation in two voices --  hers and his -- was what made this book so absorbing.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I liked the ending.  It left you thinking.
B009HELT3C|1.0|The MIB franchise has been creative and witty, and the actors have really added personality and fun to the story.  But this third installment misses the mark.  There's nothing new, other than a great portrayal of a younger version of K.  Admittedly, the final 15 minutes are good, but it isnt enough to make the movie a good investment of your time.  You'd do better to watch MIB or MIB II again.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Kind of scary to think our CIA actually may work that way.  DeMille is fantasttic.  He really builds the suspense and I don't know how he manages some complicated plots.
B004DHUAZQ|1.0|I like a good action flick, but it isn't enough to have an all-star cast.  An engaging storyline and good acting would have helped tremendously.  I've seen far better of both in other action flicks with each of these actors.  Nothing to see here; move along.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It works just fine. The cord lets me read in bed so the Kindle doesn't run out of charge while I'm reading.
B00138KCU6|5.0|the greatest musical/poet artist of all time.  Incredible human being....remembers where he came from and reminds all to be better human beings.  god bless Bruce Springsteen.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|If you enjoyed 50 Shades of Grey this book is very similar.  It has a good story line, and certainly will keep your attention.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I believe I have read every Harry Bosch story that Michael Connelly has written and I have never been disappointed by them.<br />This is another terrific story of a character that has been fully developed through the years until Harry Bosch is like an old friend.<br />  These aren't stories that you read for the bang-bang, shoot-em up action, because that isn't what Harry does. Michael Connelly keeps me interested by what Harry is thinking.  He makes mistakes too, like a normal person would. He's not the perfect &#34;superhero&#34; type that never fails.<br />  Reading this story will surely help you become a Michael Connelly/Harry Bosch fan like me.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Nothing more to say than 5 stars!!!!  Only bad part is I have to wait for the next  show in 2013.
B002LFPAUC|2.0|I have owned the VHS boxed set of Fawlty Towers for a long time, and have been waiting for the DVD version to come out for at least five years.  When it finally does come out, it is a complete disappointment, as usual.<br /><br />Once again, BBC has overcompressed the show you care about so they can include a partially filled disc of Extras that no one cares about.<br /><br />The set has \\"Remastered\\" plastered across the front, and on the startup menu of each of the shows.  The remastering must have been to reduce the video quality from the original as much as possible.<br /><br />I have been on the point for years of transferring my VHS copies to DVD, since it seemed like it was never going to get released.  I think I might have gotten better quality that way, even though, per the BBC long-standing policy of assuring that classics are preserved for posterity in the shoddiest possible manner, they are recorded at four-hour format instead of two-hour like they should have been.<br /><br />All twelve episodes are crammed onto two DVDs, assuring the lowest possible video quality and the maximum possible degredation.<br /><br />As if that weren't enough, they make you sit through a full five minutes of FBI warnings and ads for other BBC products before you can even get to the main menu!  Hit the Stop button at any point in this process, and then the Menu button just takes you back to the beginning of the FBI warning, and you have to sit through the whole five minutes again!<br /><br />Once you finally do make it to the main menu, Prunella Scales is shouting something at four times the volume of the entire rest of the disk!<br /><br />I do have to admit that the extras are better than usual.  The interviews are actually interesting.  The outtakes are better than just people blowing their lines, which is all they typically consist of.  But there are only four of them.  I can't imagine they take more than five or six minutes total.<br /><br />Thanks again, Beeb, for seeingto it that another classic of twentieth century comedy goes down in history with absolute rock-bottom quality.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|It coo for what it do. Could be better...but yahoo never intention u keep playing I guess. But yea it's pretty coo tho. &quot;No shade&quot;
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|Well done, well acted, Charlize Theron stole the show. Being a Snow White collector it was something I wanted to add to other items I have.  Good job, entertaining, great special effects
0321885112|5.0|You know those books that have one, maybe two ideas but the author adds 500 pages around them? Well this book is the opposite. It has great ideas, communicated in a clear, eloquent style and beautifully illustrated. Just what you'd expect from a great designer as Mike R. Here are the three things I love most about the book: 1) it really encourages you to draw. Ever since I bought the book I  pulled out the Moleskine and started practicing hand lettering, 2) it has practical advice on how to sketch with many, many examples, 3) it has quite a few two-page spreads with sketchnotes from featured sketchnoters for inspiration and to illustrate different styles.  This is truly, one-of-a-kind, amazing book. One more thing, the spellchecker is still redlining the word \\"sketchnotes\\". This, in time, will change with Mike's book.
0446554995|3.0|Series fatigue = a situation wherein writers lack the time or desire to meet fans' demands for more books in a popular series. J.K. Rowling triumphed over this stumbling block, but it looks like Preston and Childs have fallen prey.<br /><br />Two Graves isn't the worst book in the Pendergast saga, but the elements were all in place for a far superior product. The many cliffhangers that Cold Vengeance left dangling provided such a fertile ground for a terrific follow up.<br /><br />The latest book seemed to be star-crossed from the very start, shown by the ham-handed early-release distribution of the beginning chapters in order to maintain reader interest. It doesn't seem like Preston and Childs put the necessary time and effort into the project, and it showed in the length of time it took to produce it, as well as in the half-baked execution.<br /><br />What I found most objectionable was the extreme depression scenes. Its understandable that Pendergast had just gone through a horrific mental upheaval, but with his known training in the spiritual arts it seems inconceivable that he could have fallen so low. The entire scenario seemed forced, and I just didn't buy it.<br /><br />The characterization of the main antagonist for the majority of the book was somewhat cartoonish, and could have been toned down a bit, but I could live with it. Overall, though, in the end the depth of the mystery explored by the book just didn't match my anticipation. There was just less intrigue than could have been, and should have been.<br /><br />Two Graves is an interesting read, and is recommended. I gave it three stars because of how far it fell from what it potentially could have been. Hopefully, Preston and Childs will put the necessary work in to make the next installment a real blockbuster.
B002NZTZ8S|4.0|A movie that captures the spirit of the holiday season for any doubters out there --- the &#34;animation&#34; is also of high quality.  Overall, a very good movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|So simple to use & easy to see on your tablet or Kindle Fire!!  Loved it on first try! Awesome!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|The book is great, like all the others. Lee Child has a gift that keeps on giving  - to us fans!
1455502758|5.0|Having suffered from cancer myself and going through chemotherapy as a young man I know all too well the pain that Christopher Hitchens went through as I read his final words. To the end, Christopher possessed his incredible intellect while reflecting upon his own death, while having some hope that he may make it through it, though it was a hope that probably seemed unlikely. I found this as touching or more so than Leo Tolstoy's 'The Death of Ivan Ilyich'.<br /><br />He was a courageous man, intelligent and polemic. He is greatly missed. As I read the after-word it seems his wife writes quite eloquently as well.
007174889X|5.0|Although overwhelming, very well put together & organized for easy reference. Good quality book set and is important for any student entering a career as a medical practitioner.
B009329Y30|5.0|This movie was great. The director hit it on the nail on this one! Nicholas Sparks is a phenomenal author and being able to see his story on screen is just amazing. No other word to describe The Lucky One. The movie is about a marine named Logan Thiabolt (sp?) who survives multiple attacks due to finding a picture. His journey to find the young woman in the picture to thank her for saving his life.<br /><br />Zac Efron is so good at showing true emotions. And he is extremely attractive! Instant classic movie to add to the list of girl's movie night.
0060245867|4.0|Cute book for kids.  Thought the pictures were fun and it has a funny story line. My 3 year old loved it.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|i thought the movie probably suffered a bit being compared to the first two movies.  the story felt a little disjointed and i thought they moved a little bit to far away from &#34;realism&#34; in this one.  if this is the weak part of the trilogy however, it is light years ahead of most others...
B00632HWOG|1.0|If it might be, it could be.<br />If it were so it would be.<br />As it isn't, it ain't.<br />That's logic.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|I am a heavy reader and I've watched TV for a very long time...the finest acting ever is displayed in the series.  The mind set of the 50's, 60's unfolds into the world of advertising.  The people who work in the advertising office and the changes that occur in it, is presented  as the years go by.  The fashions, attitudes and events are exquisitely portrayed.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|It is hard to say this, but this may have been the BEST Clancy book I have read, and I have read Red October and ALL of his Jack Ryan books! This is a must read book, and hopefully ... Clancy is not predicting the future! It was ominous when the Twin Towers fell to &#34;Debt of Honor&#34; ... it seems as though Al-Qeda was inspired by it ... but his subsequent books sent a message! Hopefully, &#34;Threat Vector&#34; will send a comparable message to those who wish to harm our economy and nation!
030716327X|1.0|Book is very poorly made. Story the same as years ago however very disappointed with the quality of the book
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Outstanding quality and a real musical treasue. A great addition to ones musical library.I Highly recommend this to &#34;Miz&#34; fans!
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|It's a funny movie. Really funny with a good crowd. As with Family Guy, be ready for a lot of references you won't get. This movie probably won't age well, but I do recommend watching it now. One thing Seth always deserves credit for is hard hitting humor.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I love this movie! Has been a favorite since it came out and been through several children and now grandchildren~
B000SW4DXK|5.0|Fantastic movie and the kids love it!  Great for keeping the magic of Christmas alive with the children.  Highly recommend it!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|It is well written, humorous, sad, exciting, and descriptive. However, the ending was a drawback in my opinion, too convoluted.
B000YHG72E|5.0|awesome movie !  this is 1 of the mainstream Christmas movies now.  It is so funny, but best of all, it's a clean movie.
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|The Secret Keeper is written in Kate Morton's usual style marrying past and present to present a well crafted mystery /romance. It makes for a fascinating read.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|This case was very sleek.  Not as bulky as the Otter-box.  The one thing that made me return the case was the poor sound quality.  Callers always complained that they couldn't understand what I was saying (Muffled Sounds). I recently purchased the same case from Best Buy and it works perfectly.
B001TXWJ4M|3.0|I did not veiw this CD.  I is a gift for my son.  I have no upinion of the film.  Also I probably would not watch this program.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|The beginning of the book was very hard to get through. on my kindle it didnt get good till about 26% after that it was entertaining and a very good graphic story. I would recommend the book to someone however I may tell them to start at about 20-25%
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I'm just starting out with photography and wasn't sure what type of camera bag to get. I could've chosen a better/pricier Hama, Tamrac, or Kata bag but couldn't choose between them, especially considering the prices on some of their bags. I decided to get this AmazonBasics backpack as a starter bag because I could always use it later on just to store stuff.<br /><br />This bag is simply amazing for the price. Its very durable and sturdy. The zippers are very strong and do not snag when zipping/unzipping. The straps are thick and comfortable. A Manfroto compact tripod and a Slik compact tripod easily secures in place on the side. I can fit my 13\\" Macbook Air in the front slot.  I like the two velcro straps that come with the bag; it helps secure larger lenses as well as the camera.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|an excellent thought provoking book for young adults and adults.  It can provide a way to communicate with your child if he/ she likes to read.
B005ZMUWWY|5.0|I loved this movie so much I have it on my kindle as a personal favorite.I hope I'm not the only one who loves this that much!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book captured me from the start.  Now I will have to read the next one fur sure when it is released.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Glad I took a friends advice and read this book.  Looking forward to the next one in the series. Great story
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|If you are considering a Disney flick to watch with the kids, this hits the mark. Its typical Disney themes, independent kids, parents don't understand, villain to be dealt with, and a renewed understanding at the end. Keltic based background, the visuals are striking at times. Not Avitar, but definately Pixar. Lots of funny stuff going on. The boys are really cool. Be prepared for a heart tugger along the way, but don't worry about the ending... Hey, its Disney.
B00846REIS|5.0|Another great book by Sylvia Day.  So glad I took a friends recommendation and read this book.  Look forward to the next one in the series.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I was surprised how much I enjoyed it, so long after the original. I was worth the renting price and I might buy it.
B0085YNML2|4.0|I rated this product with 4 stars because these games are fun,non-violent and educational.  This will keep my kids engaged.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I did not like the ending-actually, there wasn't any ending!  very frustrating!  I would not reccomend it for anyone! Not a good book!
B0076DELIG|5.0|This book captures the reader all the way and the ending is really great. I would recommend it to anyone and I have read almost all of the Harry Bosch Novels.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a great read. Twists and turns and feeling yourself pulling for each character at times.  Fabulous!  I would read more from this author.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|It was what I expected and more.  Really a casual time piece and get good compliments on it, it is my weekend watch.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|This bag was received in excellent condition and extremely quick for free shipping. There are plenty of compartments for tools and equipment of all shapes and sizes. The compartment for laptop storage has plenty of space for my Dell Latitude E6430 as well as adequate cushion and support. I would recommend this bag to anyone in need of a high quality constructed backpack for a reasonable price.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|This movie had some great twists and great effects. Unfortunately, one of those effects was \\"nudity\\". I guess, as a Mom of 14 year old, I thought that PG-13, would not have nudity in it. Just glad that we saw it before we watched it with our kids. Can someone tell me when nudity became okay for something other than an R rating? They could have left that whole part out, and it would have been fine. So sad, that they thought it would be a better movie for the young and old when they decided to even spend money on that part! Just goes to show, you can't trust the rating system anymore! Signed, A Sad Mom
B006MW3V6U|5.0|one of the best series I have seen on master piece theater.I hope to see more programing like it on tv
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|I would give it a zero if I could. I can't get the things to download. It says downloading but never does it.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|When my wife first told me about renting this movie, I was a little hesitant in watching it.  But after watching Catfish, I was pretty impressed.  I really enjoyed the movie and now I will start watching the TV show.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This set of games give a lot more challenge than my older version. My wife agrees and it is diffacult to get game away from her.
B00389XV42|5.0|I struggle to stay asks when I am working at my desk often.  This series is something fun and entertaining to listen to while I work that helps keep my brain alert
B005HJ6MRO|5.0|I store all of my files on a network drive so its great to be able to access them from anywhere. I have not one complaint about wd2go, it also allows me to transfer files to and from my android phone. Never even had a hiccup with this app, its awesome!
B000U6BT40|5.0|This is yet another really great series combining comedy, drama, and mystery seemlessly and wonderfully balanced just like Chuck.  I really love shows like this.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have spider solitare on all my devices - love this game - so easy to use - fun stuff
B00442OI1C|5.0|I think this was one of the best series to come along in a long time with a fun mix of comedy, drama, and mystery that always seemed to balance perfectly
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love to check the weather - I am still learning this app in its kindle fire version - thanks!
B00A757EFW|3.0|get what you pay for. wish it said it was a demo for the full gave tho. fun for the little time you get to play it.
B008PWUYVA|4.0|It does its job - unfortunately, I have to say that the little velcro piece fell off and will need to be glued back on...
B003L77GG0|5.0|love the smallville series. glad to find the last season for under $30. got the item before date it was supposed to arrive.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I am sorry I bought this.  I have been unable to go even a day without playing this for at least an hour or 2.  Don't buy if you love match 3 games and don't have a lot of time.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|After watching the first 3 Bourne movies, which I considered spectacular, this was a tremendous letdown.  I really enjoyed the characterizations of the first 3, but this seemed hollow to me.
B00111YM5G|4.0|Even in his death he is still one of my favorite actors. I wish he had longer to of been able to see his star fade.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|This movie should have never even tried to be a comedy. It didn't even come close to a dark comedy I really can't believe that I watched it. Not worth the money to rent even if it was .99c
B001JDGK2E|5.0|You know, I had already bought 'Funhouse', but I am a huge P!nk fan, so I wanted to get the deluxe edition with the bonus tracks, and I absolutely loved it even more. The bonus tracks are amazing, as are the other songs on the album. My personal favorites were probably &#34;So What&#34;, &#34;I Don't Believe You&#34;, &#34;Please Don't Leave Me&#34;, and &#34;It's All Your Fault&#34;. Every track was phenomenal, though, with my least favorite probably being &#34;One Foot Wrong&#34; or &#34;Crystal Ball&#34;. I hardly listen to them, but the rest I constantly listen to. I mean, even though many consider it a break-up album, I would classify it as more of a... &#34;Moving on, I'll get better&#34;-type album because most of it is upbeat and it basically tells the story of P!nk and Carey Hart, and in the end, they finally ended up back together. I thought it was a beautiful album and it is probably in my Top 10 or 15 favorite albums of all-time. Everything about it was great. It had very relatable songs and it had a little bit of something for everyone. I would definitely recommend it for any music fan. P!nk's vocals and songwriting are just... phenomenal. I loved it.
B008LY9AWG|5.0|Once again, Michael Connelly shows his exceptional talent whether writing short stories, novels or anthologies.  I've been hooked on his words since the early days of Angel's Flight.  I have never read anything penned by Michael Connelly which disappointed me or my expectations<br /><br />Simply a brilliant writer
B009FZFONO|5.0|Love every episode!!!! Left me in suspense and I can't wait until the rest of season three comes out in February
B0076DELIG|4.0|A good Harry Bosch story.  Kept my interest.  I enjoy the meticulous way HB goes about investigating a 20 year old crime.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book makes you think about what happens to the human spirit after a person dies it is a personal account of life after death.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I chose three stars because I feel like this is a good product, but could be a great product.  I do not think its as user friendly as it could be and I believe thats why it might discourage older users.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|A fun and quick read that had enough to keep me turning the pages to the end.  Highly recommend it.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|I got this for my nephew's b-day, an he loved it! each day came with a little figure you can make. I highly suggest this for lego lovers.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I loved this movie. The acting was great. It is heartfelt, thought provoking about the perspective of those aging and also funny.
1423140605|5.0|I really enjoy reading this saga, every book contains a lot of fun and action, can't wait for the next one.
B009NOVCSS|5.0|While there are some glaring omissions, it is the most comprehensive collection and without a doubt the best box set ever. If you're a Stones fan or becoming one, get it. A
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Joe Abercrombie's books have everything I look for in a great fantasy book.  The Characters have depth and go through unexpected turns.  The dialogue reads natural while being extremly witty at the same time.  I also like the growth of of characters through the different books.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Expect the unexpected in this movie. I thought I would miss Jason Bourne, but I didn't mind that i only saw his photo. Well done!
B009LDMJGA|5.0|When Soundgarden arrived in 1988, they released their debut \\"Ultramega OK\\" on the indie punk label SST Records. Two years later, they followed it up with their major label debut \\"Louder Than Love\\". By the time their subsequent albums \\"Badmotorfinger\\" and \\"Superunknown\\"were released, they were seen as one of the leaders of the grunge movement from Seattle. In 1996, they recorded what would eventually be their swan song- the self produced \\"Down On The Upside\\". The following year, they called it quits and went their separate ways. Over the next several years, the lead singer Chris Cornell would record three solo albums. He would also join the remaining members of the band Rage Against The Machine for their new project Audioslave. Drummer Matt Cameron would become the drummer in Pearl Jam, while guitarist Kim Thayil  and bassist Ben Shepherd became in-demand session musicians. In 2010 Soundgarden reformed, news was widespread and a new album was in the works. In Fall 2012, they released their first album in sixteen years- the Universal Republic release \\"King Animal\\".<br /><br />Their new album was produced by themselves with Adam Kasper- who also helped produced \\"Down On The Upside\\". Judging from the sound of \\"King Animal\\", it picks up where the last album left off. On the lead off track \\"Been Away Too Long\\", Cornell sings of being out of place in a city he once called home. Optimism and hope is the theme behind the hard rocking 'Non-State Actor\\", while little remorse is shown for hurting someone on \\"By Crooked Steps\\". Cornell sings of isolation on \\"A Thousand Days Before\\", while the ballad \\"Bones Of Birds\\" employs an unpredictable time signature. The songs \\"Taree\\" bear the noticeable trademark sound of Soundgarden, while the brief song \\"Attrition\\" clocks in at well under three minutes. On the song \\"Black Saturday\\", there's an appearance of a horn section- a rarity for a Soundgarden album. Cornell ponders about the meaning of dreams on the acoustic uptempo track \\"Halfway There\\". \\"Worse Dreams\\" has a musical arrangement to accompany the dark nature of the lyrics, while \\"Eyelid's Mouth\\" bears a Black Sabbath influence. The album closes with \\"Rowing\\", a song in which Cornell sings about being motivated by living. Overall, Soundgarden's \\"King Animal\\" is a great album from the pioneers of the grunge era. While they have aged a bit over the years, they haven't lost a step in their music.y There\\". \\"Worse Dreams\\" has a musical arrangement to accompany the dark nature of the lyrics, while \\"Eyelid's Mouth\\" bears a Black Sabbath influence.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|I bought this to read in my spare time, and its full of good information, well worth the few dollars it costed me to buy it.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Sad and funny at the same time.  My husband and I enjoyed it even though<br />some would consider it a &#34;chick flick&#34;.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Much has been praised, deservedly, about &#34;Homeland&#34;.  But one thing I'd like to note, for those who haven't seen it yet, is that there is much fascination to the &#34;back story&#34; that gets revealed along the way.  This is brilliantly conceived, and adds greater and greater depth and understanding as the season moves along.
B003L77GG0|5.0|I was so glad to have found this cuz they didnt have it in stores only had all ten series all together for a outrageous price n the only complete 10th season they had was on blue ray! So im so glad to have this! :D
B002M87W1I|5.0|This movie shows what has happened to television news. watch it and see why you can't beleive the news any more.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|This game is fine for the younger set, but does not offer much of a challenge for an elder person, like me.....
B0097PW7H8|5.0|It seems to do what it's supposed to do; it helps you keep the battery charged the longest.  I like it.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|The whole family enjoys this album. The kids especially love the amazing sound pentatonix can produce with no instruments. They are a very talented bunch.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|It was a very funny movie that I believe a lot of people can relate to with some of their past and present relationships.  It's a nice movie to watch with your significant other.
B0097L29KM|5.0|This album in vinyl format can be summed up in so few words. Its mindblowing superstaggeringly out your pants into another world incomparably soothing powerful overjoyed incredible piece of music. An absolute must have!
B009ESIGHI|4.0|I've loved the movie since it came out.  I would give it a 5 with \\"When Love is Gone\\" in the cut...but mostly ticked off when I try to put in the digital copy code I get an error saying the code has already been used.  I bought this direct from Amazon and advertised as new.  Looks new unless they opened it and then re-shrink wrapped it :(
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|If you have already seen the previous Bourne movies, this movie took way too long to get into action. If you had not seen them, then somebody really could learn that a little really goes a long way. This was not a little and given the way it ended, it really better have a second movie to follow. If not it really should only get 2 stars.
0345803507|5.0|Absolutly love this book series. Bought this for my mother who was wanting to read it!! Came before it said it would arrive.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|When I heard about a &#34;zombie&#34; show, I thought it would be incredibly cheesy. I can't believe how wrong I was!!!!! This is one of the best shows out there!!!
0345803493|5.0|Bought this book for myself. Love the book series!!! Can't wait to get them all read. Came before it said it would.
B002BVYBC4|5.0|This is a wonderful movie to watch from begin to end... What a different movie from the others movies that they have made...........
B0053TMP24|4.0|Very good book. Also loved Mark of Athena. Praise to Rick Riordan. I will never forget him or his books.
B008602KQI|4.0|Read all the books, can't wait for the sequel, good movie, loved katniss and characters, just wish there was more to it
B000GWE44U|5.0|This is such a great movie.  Jack Nicholson is at his best. I could watch this movie over and over.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I was looking for a light, fun, uplifting book, and this met the bill.  I enjoyed that characters, and story line.  Add a star if you are a football fan.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|Based on the negative reviews about this product, I wasn't to optimistic BUT other consumers may not have hooked it properly or could have received a defective one. I received ours quickly, well package, and in excellent working condition. It only took 2 minutes to attatch and we absolutely love it bc my son's room is not too big and now he's able to stay in room vs taking to the family room just to have enough room to play his Kinect games.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I bought the book yesterday as soon as I found out it was available early! I couldn't put the book down. I just kept wanting to know what was going to happen next! Kept me wanting to more...loved the characters!!!
B000ICLRIE|5.0|Kingdom of Heaven is an incredible, gorgeous movie. The sets and costumes are just breathtakingly beautiful, with a soundtrack to match. It is even more impressive that it is largely factual, though of course &#34;Hollywood-ized&#34;. The director's cut is almost an entirely different story than the theatrical version, with a huge amount of added material and actual plot changes. While the theatrical version is good, the director's cut is far superior (and makes a lot more sense). It is quite bloody and gory, so probably not great for kids.<br />This is one of my all time favorite movies, which I recommend to everyone. If you're a Gladiator or Braveheart fan, you'll definitely love this one.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Simple to download, easy to use, what more could you ask?  Have had no problems with this app.  Thanks for having it available.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is an absolutely charming tale of a &#34;supervillain&#34; and his minions. Carell does a fantastic job as the main character. This movie is hilarious and cute enough for kids of all ages and parents to enjoy. We are both in our twenties and watch it regularly, just for fun!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I thought this movie would be super depressing and went only because a friend wanted me to.  However, its treatment of death was delicate and even humorous.  Amazingly, it was more about humanity's search for a meaningful life and the continuance of love of life no matter what.  I highly recommend it.  The cinematography and scenery are amazing.
0792164903|5.0|I am not a fan of Tim Burton's wacky, crazy weird movies like Alice in Wonderland and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Sleepy Hollow is not nearly as over-the-top as these, although it still tells the story with a delightful tongue-in-cheek twist. Dark and complex with beautiful costumes and sets, this is a fantastic Halloween story. Would not recommend it for younger kids, there is quite a bit of gore.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another great book by Vince Flynn.  Mitch Rapp takes on the &#34;idiots&#34; within the US bureaucracy to save the US from itself once again!!  A must read!
1582406723|4.0|I had not known that the popular television show was based on a graphic novel. Got this as a gift for my boyfriend who is a fan of both graphic novels and the show - he liked it but was still a bigger fan of the tv version. A lot of the illustrations are black and white, and it is on cheap newsprint type paper.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The characters stay with you long after you read the last line.  An easy read that is well worth the time.
0345803485|1.0|I know there are more than enough reviews of this book on the internet, which is actually why I bought it. I was curious how a book (about sex, no less!) could be so despised. Oh boy.<br /><br />I have to say I'm pretty sure you could find coloring books that are better written.<br /><br />The main character is so whinging and pathetic (think Kristen Stewart at her whiniest) that I literally wanted to slap her. And the plot is just as bad. By halfway through the first chapter I wanted to throw this book at the wall, and by chapter two I actually did.<br />I flipped through it a bit to see if it miraculously improved as it went on, but if anything it got even worse. The sex scenes are cringeworthy and awkwardly written, and if you're not into BDSM/maledom/female sub it gets weirder and weirder. Even if you ARE into those things, you're probably cringing at the awful portrayal of them (in even worse writing).<br /><br />Don't try my experiment, save yourself the money.
B007SGM084|5.0|I had to keep reading to see what happened next with Fifty Shades of Grey.  Kept me consumed until the end.  Wish there was more come about Fifty and Ana.
B0035LJY6C|4.0|This has always been one of my favorites - though possible more for nostalgia than quality. It is slapstick, goofy humor which is fun for everyone, and definitely ok for the whole family. Though it may have some slightly creepy parts, I don't think it is anything inappropriate for a PG audience. The costumes and sets are elaborate and fun to watch.
B0085P2Z6E|1.0|Not worth the time to review, but I need a bunch more words to finish this review. Three more words
B009FZHYKU|4.0|After the stella season 1 season 2 kind of floundered for a story. Episode after episode of characters aimlessly wandering around, accomplishing nothing - seems a little silly for a zombie plot that could literally go anywhere. They seem to have figured this out in season 3, and have drastically improved the episode plots. There is WAY more action, and a lot more activity. And they've even managed to successfully incorporate some very interesting new characters - finally! I haven't finished the season yet, but it just keeps getting better and will hopefully finish strong.
B007P7UF0G|1.0|The music played but the dialogue did not was nearly muted regardless the volume level..  Picture was good.  Disc a disappointment.
B003SI9WYG|5.0|How can anyone not love Tim Burton's quintessential holiday classic? It is a beautiful stop-motion movie infused through and through with Burton's unique style and an incredible soundtrack. Maybe slightly scary for very young children (it is about Halloween, after all) it is overall a kid friendly film with characters children love. Fortunately it is also quite humorous enough for adults to enjoy as well. We still watch this for both Halloween and Christmas every year. Absolutely recommend, especially if you're bored around the holidays!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|One of the funniest movie I have seen all my life. I have not laugh so hard in a very long time.<br /><br />WB
1451695195|2.0|As much as I wanted to believe this story, it just did not ring true.  And the way the story was told made the author seem more interested in extolling his own virtues than describing those of heaven.  Sorry.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|ever since I was little I loved playing bulldozer games. now om older and I can still play them anytime now.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book kept my interest through the whole book. I have never read a book like this and was hoping their would be another after this one and there was.
B000002GFC|5.0|This is the Best of Cream and don't know what to say except the CD sounded fine and the group sounded just like they always sound. If you like the group you will like this CD.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wow. What an ending. This book completed the three. The sex was wonderful and it was a very good story.<br />I was glad they author explained what Christian was thinking about Ana in the beginning. I'm also pleased that Christian truly love Ana and he was at ease with his life
1455502626|4.0|Bought as a gift for someone who enjoys this particular author.  Assume this one will be as enjoyable, and look forward to reading it myself.
B009K45Y62|5.0|I bought this originally for myself but saw how much they were selling for on ebay and decided to sell it too.  Tripled my money in no time.  :)
B005LAIISA|4.0|A clean, funny movie that was easy to watch to just sit back and relax on an evening.  I think the first two were funnier, but this was definitely still funny.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|What is not to love.  Christmas in New York, Santa Claus, great story line in just believing.  Richard Attenborough is the perfect Santa, I know I believe.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|awesome game and I say it fun for people who like mine games. it could be hard but manily its easy ;)<br />I hare It for 2 day Max and I am half way done with it.
B0083P1QUM|1.0|This one just rambled on and on, no real suspense except for the last one. Never engaged us in Marino's character. She's got to pick it up or I'm done with Patrica Cornwell's books
B000ATQYT2|5.0|So glad this movie is finally on DVD, as we have been watching an old vhs for years. This version does include the song &#34;The love is gone&#34; and that whole scene. Great quality!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Still enjoy the character Harry Bosch.... Keeps you engaged throughout. I look forward to the next one to see how his new girlfriend and daughters characters develop.
B008NMT684|4.0|This is a cute app, my almost 2 year old likes it better than my almost 4 year old because it's a bit easy for the older crowd. But, it's cute and keeps them occupied!<br /><br />It works great on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus phone, and the boys' kurio 7 tablet.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I think the story line for this series is excellent. It would make a great movie without all the sex.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat. The author does a great job of keeping the reader guessing.  I was shocked at how it turned out.  I highly recommend it and am anxious to read the other two books by the same author.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|If you look beyond all the sex, it is a good story line. I would say worth the read for sure.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|I absolutely love that there is a free app for LinkedIN fort he Kindle. It allows me to send messsages and respond to others while I am work since I can't access it from my work computer.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|My Granddaughter is learning some songs with this app.<br />Very cool and worth the price! She is 10 years old, but<br />anyone would enjoy it.
B002BWP49M|5.0|I loved the books and I loved the movies and I bought this to continue my collection of the movies. I can't wait for part two to come out so that my collection can be complete.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I like the character Harry Bosch and the escapades he gets into.  I think Harry gets a little crazy, but he always comes out on the side of justice.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|I liked this movie and felt the plot was OK. The problem that I have with this movie is that I feel the last good Aliens movie was Aliens and it went down hill from there. First the theater cut on Aliens wasn't the one that's great. The extended version it much, much better. After that we got the last few and I just couln't get into them. This movie attempts to fill in some of the unanswered question form the first movie and at the end leaves you another question. (I wish movies wouldn't do this ALL the time. Some stuff is worth it but not ALL THE TIME!) Anyway. some of the special effects are very good and I found Charlize Theron's role very interesting.  Overall, if you liked the Alien movies you should like this. It's worth adding to your collection.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|i don't mind porn if it's well written. this is boring because it is poorly written and sooooooo repetitive.<br /><br />instead of fifty shades of grey, it should be fifty shades of trash.
B008H6GHL0|4.0|We get the further adventures of Leon S. Kenney in this second CGI movie based on the video game. The first one was a bit better, I think, but this one is a good watch. I feel the first movie had a better plot and I liked the story line better and this accounts for the 4 stars. This film does keep you interested but I found myself thing how much better it would have been if the plot wasn't a bit more far removed from the first film. I'd still buy it again so it's still a good movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app. Very usefull and user friendly. I especially enjoy the ease of connectivity between my Kindle Fire and my smart phone.  A great way to share God's Word any time, any where, with everyone.
B008602KQI|4.0|The pace and tone of the movie are very well done.  The coming of age story of the 2 stars is touching and heart warming, while the action and darkness behind the world they live in is quite ominous and can be chilling.  Katniss is a wonderful, unwitting hero and it is great to see a strong female character lead the way.  Her perseverance in the face of such great odds is a great thing to see.
B002LW9ITY|5.0|It arrived quickly and my daughter loved it.<br />She plays with the cars a lot and they are surprisingly well made and roll nice
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|This was suprisingly good. The acting was above average, script above average, special effects good. This is NOT the orginal, the story is far different and to appreciate the movie you have to consider this a completly different story.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|The movie was much better then expected I would recommend giving this movie a go and watch with an open mind.
B005GYGCOI|1.0|Layout follows paper edition. Not designed for ebook. No ability to reference contents to chapters makes it impossible to easily find items.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|The 4-Hour Chef is a very unique book.  I am only mid-way through the book.  I find it very interesting.  The book talks about a lot of things that I find very interesting and have never even thought about.  It really makes me see the broad picture about learning.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is a great addition to the Angry Birds franchise. I could and sometimes do play this game for hours on end.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book. It was a great beginning to an amazing trilogy. I am already on my second time reading it.
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|No blood or guts... just wonderful characters showing what love really is ! Don't miss seeing this one if you haven't already. Great for Christmas!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a great ending to amazing trilogy but it kept me wanting more. Maybe EL James will come out with some more similar.
0767812387|5.0|THis has become one of my favorites!  Chayanne is excellent and the dancing is brilliant.  THere is a scene of dancing with Chayanne and Jane Krakowski that is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen.  This is a really fun movie, particularly if you like dancing.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was absoultly amazing. One that I couldn't put down for a minute. I would recommend it to every woman out there.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Somewhat dissapointed, as the sequel to Fall of Giants this book wasn't the page turner I thought it would be slower paced, lots  of &#34;words&#34; probably could have been half the pages.
B009ZE27US|5.0|you guys who have 1 stars do not read descriptions because they do not have a clue what it is supposed to be
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Loved the book. Very spiritual. More visual than the movie which was also a pleasure. Characters are deliciously complex. Could not put my Ipad down.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|We especially liked that the movie departed from earlier princess films in that the focus was on the mother/daughter relationship and not on finding &#34;true love.&#34; And it's nice to see a Disney film where the parents aren't ridiculous.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I grew up watching this every Christmas and can't wait to share it with my girls (when they get here)!
B005HSL626|5.0|I have always loved playing with my food as a child. This game is giving me a second chance to play with my food again.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|LOVE IT...my husband would be crushed if they were to every cancel this series.  Hope it stays on for many more years to come!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|One of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The animationn of the bear was perfect. would recommend toany adult w/ a Sence of humor
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|The Dark Knight Rises is about Bane and the league of shadows wanting to destroy Gotham and it also introduces Catwoman to the mix too! I don't want to write a huge review about this movie because I don't want to give away too much info, but I'll say this, if you liked the previous 2 movies, you will love this finale! It has a lot to do with Batman Begins, so if you haven't seen Batman Begins, I suggest you watch that one first. All in all I give this movie 5 stars!
B004UID2LC|5.0|i rated it five star because its an awsome app and it puts the star ratings on the thing for you to look at your self.<br />~i dont dis like anything about it at the moment so as long as it keeps working its all good<br />~i got it recomended to me from my boyfriend! again who ever has a tablet in my family i would recomend it to them
B001VWBFTG|1.0|I like several of their songs so I bought an album.  I am disappointed. I only like maybe two songs.
B005HSL626|3.0|its got some freezing issues with it that could be worked out cause it does it occasionally<br />~i dis like it cause it freezes then forces me to shut it down..<br />i would recomend it if it didnt always freeze
B001XVP9CY|2.0|This has always been one of my favorite old sci-fi movies. But in the &#34;Final Cut&#34; version Ridley Scott removed almost all of Harrison Ford's narration. This totally killed the retro film-noir vibe that the original movie had, which was one of my favorite things about it. As someone who's seen this movie many times, I can say that that the most memorable lines in the film for me, were in the narration.<br /><br />So if you're a fan of the original Blade Runner, I wouldn't recommend renting this version; you'll be disappointed.
B008XG1X18|4.0|i rated it a 4 star only because its not quite five star honestly..<br />i dont like it because it randomly freezes and when it does it gives me the option to &#34;force close&#34; i dont like that. otherwise the app is good!<br />i would recomend it to my boyfriend who also has a kindle fire or if anyone else in my family who has a tablet.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Get it. You will not be disappointed. This thing will last forever. Thick and heavy so you can chop just about anything, bat a manageable size, unlike the bk9.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I forced my family to see this- them being all male groaned and made chauvinistic comments, but they laughed as much as I did.  This was overall a very funny movie, Rebel Wilson (aka Fat Amy, aka Fat Patricia) totally made this movie!  She's awesome.  Yes, it is a bit cliche, but still hilarious.  See it!  And let me leave you with this visual ... the movie has a puke angel.  OMG, haha!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Every episode is full of action and the cliffhangers have me begging for more.  I love the fact that this season displays Rick's \\"human\\" side.  We all have our breaking point and losing Lori was his.
B0011TNVLY|5.0|This story will touch children and adults with the magic of Christmas! My 3 yr old enjoys the Train and all the excitment.
B004SBULWE|5.0|I have this app on my phone and now my tablet. It was originally recommended by a Verizon Wireless employee and I highly recommend it on any android device.
B004OO4UFY|5.0|This album is so wonderful and unique I never get board of it, it’s a keeper.  I find myself humming the songs all the time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have not read this book yet. Looking forward to doing so. I have another book that I will be reading first.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|I thought it was funny in some parts, despite the fact you see most of the funny parts in the trailer(s). It's on par with the family guy humor. If u like Family Guy then you'll love this movie.
B003L77GG0|5.0|gift i bought for myself to complete my collection. great price looking for new deals weekly to complete other dvd collections I have
B003SNJYSK|4.0|Hooray for Jo Nesbo. Cant wait to read more about Harry Hole. Complex and subtle plot and sinister overtones makes for an exciting read.
B007HACDLK|3.0|I have read all of vince Flynn books and this one was not as good as the others,  I guess it is because Mitch is getting older.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|This is the first Carrie album I've purchased and I love it.  The songs are all great, highly reccomend to any country music fan.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|just different adventures but same game. probably won't keep and clog up my memory we'll see because it is addicting.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|We recently took a long flight and my husband passed the time by playing this game for hours.  I think it would be good for older kids and adults.  Very entertaining and challenging.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game is addicting I can't quit once I start playing it. Should have never started playing since now I don't get anything done.
B005HSL626|5.0|My kids, my husband, and myself enjoy this app.  Fun and simple game to play to pass the time.  Great app for the kindle fire.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince still has had.  After all of the books he has written he still manages to turn out good material.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|This is a good follow up to the Bourne series.  You might want to brush up on the previous movies before watching it so you're not confused.  Very entertaining movie.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|My husband loved this movie. I sometimes had trouble understanding what Bain was saying. Overall I would watch this again.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|I really thought this would be an entertaining movie but instead I found it very dark and depressing.  After attempting to watch it twice I finally gave up and never finished it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I love that I received the product the day it was released. I hate that I had to wait until I got home from work to open it. Nonetheless, it was in great condition. I enjoyed the bonus materials as I'm a huge fan of the series and the Batman character. Also Amazon did a price match and refunded the difference to my account which is excellent customer service. I enjoyed they were willing to do that for a loyal customer. Would consider using the services to pre-order items for date of release-arrival to my door again.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|A prequel to the &#34;Alien&#34; films. Special effects make this film worth watching. Otherwise, the story is so-so. There are a couple of great lines - &#34;If they made us, who made them?&#34; - &#34;Sometimes you first have to destroy before you create.&#34; Reminded me of a passage in Jeremiah 1:10: &#34;I have appointed you...To pluck up and to break down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.&#34;
B004EKCNMA|5.0|I loved the movie...My only disappointment is that it is too short. I wanted to see more 'cause I'm a Christmas Carol fanatic.
B0088WFZQG|4.0|Predictable story, but it's kind of fun saying, &#34;I knew that was coming!&#34; A guy film, lots of blowing stuff up, complete with a great car chase.
B00A23MVHA|5.0|No reason to review this movie.  If you're reading this you've most likely seen it.  If you haven't then watch it!  Fans of Seth MacFarlane will not be disappointed.  Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis compliment each other well and bring their own hilarity to the table.  Definitely one of my all time favorite comedies.
B004X4R3FE|5.0|As other reviewers have stated, wonderful acting, great historical story. One word got it the &#34;R&#34; rating. I'm not overly fond of profanity, but this was in context.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Been watching this show since the beginning. It is evolving into a great human story but I wish it wasn't so grotesque at times.
B007EECSFA|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT STORY AND EXTREMELY WELL WRITTEN.  IT IS THE KIND OF BOOK YOU CANNOT PUT DOWN AND AT THE VERY END YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WANT TO READ IT AGAIN!!!!
B0000669JL|5.0|I've listened to the album a hundred times with my buddies at college so I never needed to own it because it was always there.  We've all gone our seperate ways so it was time for me to own it.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Amazing! Led Zeppelin ♥ when I went to see a movie I fell in love!!!!! Robert Plant Jimmy Page !
B0010VD7EO|1.0|It was busted when I got it so I haven't been able to listen to it to form an opinion one way or the other.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book. Excellent, easy reading, I couldn't put it down. I Like to read teen romance novels before I give them to my daughter to read, and this one could be changed just a little bit and be perfect for a teenage girl.  They don't have sex before marriage, (even though they get married when she's drunk), and the love scenes are not disgustingly graphic like some of the romance novels out there that some people can be offended by.  It was for the most part, very sweet and a true &#34;feel good&#34; romance novel for mindless enjoyment!
B0000DD79B|5.0|I wasn't alive during the sixties but have spent a lot of my life studying that period of american history.  If you close your eyes you can almost imagine sitting on a lawn with a bunch of people wearing tye dye, smoking some burn and just listening.
B00AGH5LF6|5.0|This is one of my favorites. Now I can watch it every year during the holidays. Great movie and product! Thanks!
B000IKHNT8|4.0|I think these movies pretty much speak for themselves, but I'll rate this anyway. My only complaint, as might be expected, is that it's not the same movie as I grew up with in the sense that it's &#34;remastered&#34;. I like my original VHS copies where Han shoots first, but it is what it is.
B00A11AN6O|4.0|makes sharing my pictures from my phone to my tablet easy as 1 2 3. Try it and you will see.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|If you like watching Family Guy and that type of humor, Ted is like watching the live action version, but with cursing.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've been using this video for almost a year, and it has made such a difference! I did level one for about 2 weeks, then level two for a week.. I then kept with level three consistently and it was a great supplement to shed some weight off. Paired with good diet, yoga twice a week, and this video 4 times a week anyone can do it! Just stay consistent.
0756697875|4.0|my son just loved this book great photos of the lego sets, but he wishes lego makes more dc super heroes sets!
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Love it kinda makes me want to live back then. Tom Hardy was awesome. I have always loved the type of character he plays.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Elf is one of our favorite xmas movies. Just a fun, fun, fun, movie to watch. It's one of the few movies that I will watch more than once.
B0061S073A|4.0|Program works, limiting what your kids can use. If you have a non Kindle tablet, a good alternative to Freetime app.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Although as a dutchman,  I have some difficulty reading the many medical and chemical terms, I keep reading this book and viewing the youtube clips with explanations of Dr. Davis.  It seems to me that Dr.Davis has performed thorough research about the dangers of wheat in our food. I recommend it to every one who wants to get rid of their wheat-belly, to loose some weight or to people allergic for gluten.
B004QSQML8|5.0|I chose to give this five stars, because it was shipped in on time, and it looks excellent on the tv screen! I began watching this only a few days ago, and I am really impressed by the quality of blu-ray! I would recommend this film to anyone! It is excellent, and so much fun to watch!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Love SOA & glad the digital copy was available. Good quality & as long as internet is good, no lagging.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Based on the tv trailers, I knew it would be funny and it was. Now it wasn't the funniest thing I've ever seen in life...but it had enough funny moments throughout to make it worth it. I was like a 'Save the Last Dance/Step Up' version of singing instead of dancing. For $3.99 it was definitely worth it.
B003MYYJD0|5.0|Right out of the box this watch is impressive, the stock pictures don't do it justice. This watch is bold, huge and beautiful. This watch is not for everybody.  It has a masculinen/rugged yet luxury appeal that is an eye catcher. This is my first Ivicta watch and hope it lasts a long time. Don't let negitive stereo types of people who wear huge Invictas lure you away. Be you own boss with this chronograph divers watch.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Decided while shopping for others I would also treat myself. Since I was already sick of Xmas tunes, this was perfect. This girl can really sing, and I have enjoyed every song.
B00846REIS|5.0|Way interesting.<br />I love the story and the writing style. All my friends read or are currently reading the series.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|a bit technical if you're not in the medical profession, but I am, so I enjoyed this book a great deal!  Excellently written.<br />Proof of Heaven by Eben Alexander
B009FZHYKU|4.0|So far season 3 has been pretty good. I like how they switch back and forth to the gang at the prison and Angie and Newbury. The fall finale will leave you on pins and needles, ugh February is so far away. Almost every episode is jam packed with life and death decisions and of course Walkers. I only gave it 4 stars because some episodes are a bit too heavy on the gore and not detailed enough in character development. Sometimes it's like okay we get the point Zombies are gross and gooey and bloody. I just think some of it is overkill. I would like yo have seen more develop with carol and Darrel.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|for a free app...this certainly has enough to keep a person entertained...although some of the games are kind of lame...
B003X27L9U|5.0|Excellent read and could not put it down. Will be enjoyed by all who feel deeply about the emotions of others.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Had to own this this is one of those movies i like to see time from time--and its a true story
B00598XVA4|5.0|Heavy Metal Classic, if you grew up during that time period you already how great they are. Iron Maiden rocks.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|i am looking forward to watching this movie. Love the case, and I am very excited to give this as a gift. Thank you for everything.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I am always left waiting with baited breath for the next Pendergast book to come out, this was no exception. If only Preston and Childs could write faster.  This book was engrossing and a real page turner from the beginning all the way to the exciting conclusion with just enough open ended possibilities for the next book to pick up.  I can't wait to see what happens next.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This movie is great, and I am very excited about the deal I got on it. It is in great shape and I am looking forward to giving this present to my friend. It is wonderful.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The suspense continued to build right up until the last page. It provides a rare glimpse of what can happen when the common struggles of marriage spiral uncontrollably into something completely wrong. I abosolutely love it and could not put it down. Give me more! Waiting patiently for the sequel . . .
B009JBZH54|5.0|I bought two of these, one for me and one for a friend and i love it. i am excited to have all of these incredible movies and for a great price. Thank you.
B002KKCVT6|5.0|I have all kinds of sandals, but I have always enjoyed Teva sandals, especially the Tanza sandals.  I love them so much that I actually have them in brown, green, and blue.  I believe these sandals will be with me for a long time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All 3 books in this trilogy is a must read! This last book is the most complex of the 3 books.
B00932AA5G|5.0|Was out on a hike with a friend and he recommended this. My reaction was 'Dark Norwegian Humor??'<br /><br />But yes, it is true.<br /><br />Excellent film and highly recommend it.<br /><br />In the vein of Fargo, I'd say.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Ted was a good movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I mean if you like American Dad, and Family Guy, how could you not? I hope he makes more movies. This was very original!
B006OAB432|5.0|I've been a long time fan of fun. and their music. I was so glad to see their rise with the hit songs Some Nights, Carry On, and We Are Young. The vinyl comes with a CD to easily add the album to your computer and MP3 player and it has some beautiful art. I was a little wary of shipping vinyl, but Amazon's packaging is impressive. The album arrived perfect.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Very good read.  It held my interest throughout.  I liked the different theme and plot line.  Nice to read something good that's not the usual terrorist theme.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|The Brat pack rocks!  A boring day of detention could never be funnier or more enlightening.  I could watch it again and again, and have.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second installment to the &#34;Hunger Games&#34; was absolutely wonderful.  I couldn't put the book down, it was hard to believe but the second book was better than the first!! Amazing story line and the twist at the end... complete surrise!
B0087JTAKW|1.0|This book was a complete waste of time! I kept thinking it must get better but it did not. It reads as though it was written for a 5th or 6th grader who needs a book report by tomorrow. The whole concept of what life would be like for those around you if you were gone, was done so much better in the film \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" with Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed. The only value I can attribute it is as a self esteem helper for disaffected teenagers. This book was hawked on the Dr. Phil Show as a reminder that each moment of our life is to be savoured, but I did not come away with that message at all. I am so sorry that I bought it and even sorrier that I read it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't believe how amazing and mind blowing this book was.  The characters are attractive and extremely likeable, the wrtiing is beautiful and so full of desciption. The storyline is the best I've read in a long long time.  This book is so enveloping, I want to live in &#34;District 12&#34;!
B006RXQ0JO|4.0|It makes you contemplate about the gray area between right and wrong?  The movie is engaging, pretty well done, the plot is complex.
B0096BIENY|5.0|It was so nice to listen to the old songs along with the new ones.  I can listen to these guys anytime. Day or night is the right time.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Love Jude Law and Robert Downey, Jr. together.  They make a great team.  The movie has fast action, never got bored.
0385344228|2.0|I thought this was one of the most disagreeable and disturbing books I have ever read. I spoke with another person who had read it and she agrees with me.<br />A mother would not like this at all.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I find that Robert Downey, Jr and Jude Law make a wonderful pair.  They play well off each other.  Downey has become a very talented actor and gotten beyond his troubles. It shows in his acting.  I throughly enjoyed the movie.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|Agent Ethan Hunt must take his mission impossible team to save the world again. Only this time there is no support beside each other! As good as the rest, a fun ride.
B008NMT684|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old son loves these puzzles. He wasn't to good at them at first but has gotten really good at them!  I bought the full version in the app. My 4 year old daughter likes them too!
B003730LRY|5.0|This is one of those movies that is great for many generations of fans. I watched it most recently at a thanksgiving gathering, grand parents, parents, and children all had something to laugh at and enjoy! It was a great family moment.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old son loves these puzzles. He wasn't to good at them at first but has gotten really good at them!  I bought the full version in the app. My 4 year old daughter likes them too!
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|Funny funny movie thunder buddies forever one of the best movies I have seen in years<br />Better then the hangover and hangover 2
B006PHD0RW|5.0|My four year old daughter (and I!!) are hooked on this game!!  We take turns playing as a team!  This is a great game!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Nothing too complex, just straight-forward entertainment. The free version is fine, but also worth the price for hours of fun.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|It's wayyyy funny,  I didn't k.ow what to expect and thought it was going to be cheesy by just eat Hong the beginning but within the first 20 minutes it changed my mind. Great comedy.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|This movie was very funny and worth the money, ditch cable and rental stores and just get prime and watch anything you want
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Though funny at times, this movie is simply 2 hours of live action Family Guy.<br /><br />Mila Kunis was fun to look at during lulls between jokes.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This really works,if you want to watch videos.This has to be installed with other softwares though.I had almost lost faith in Kindle fire
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a great game for times when you have a few minutes.  Enjoy playing it with my kids too.
B00114RKT8|5.0|Good movie, good moral, good times. A must watch for every family. It will help you be less spoiled and more thankful.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|While it has a nice interface it lacks in utility and function. It doesn't suit ny needs, which is the ability to view history, and the usage of Greek characters and other mathematical operations and symbols.
B008N1V11U|5.0|I am glad this was available. Arkham City was good and I was hoping this would be just as good. I wasn't disappointed. If you like any of the Batman games,download this one. There might be a few minor glitches but I feel that they can be overlooked. Still good to play on Kindle Fire.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Great App does what it advertises, with just a glance you can see how well your Kindle Fire is performing. I use this for my Kindle Fire HD, it opens on awakening, I also set alerts for letting me know when the battery is at 50%, also when it is fully charged.
0060887966|5.0|I loved the book.  It is quite beautiful and a great addition to my collection.  I received it very promptly too.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|In our view the best Rebus novel yet!  Rebus as a retired cop is believable and real.  Would highly recommend.
B005LAII08|5.0|I would reccommend this movie to all famlies.  Great story line and a learning experience.<br />Our only problem is that my grand child watches it every chance she gets to use the TV.  She has parts of the movie memorized and often stops and replays sections.
B001458MI2|5.0|I like every song and the different styles. She has a great voice and most everything she does sounds good.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I felt it was too technical, medical terms I am not familiar with.  I would prefer a more simplistic style but do understand that a physician may not think in that style. I would not recommend it because of the style.  The secondary story of the adoption was much more interesting.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|All the family enjoys this game.  This one really keeps the grandchildren busy and helps develope their small motor skills.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Absolutely one of the greatest stories I've read... ever. This book taught me some solid lessons on life. I find myself referencing those lessons daily.
1401309666|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone tech-savvy and to anyone who's creative and wondering if they should try to market their idea. The world is changing, as it always does, and The Long Tail shows exactly how this aspect of our world is changing.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Bared to You was good, Reflected in You was beyond Awesome!! I literally could not put this book down.  I had to finish reading it in 2 days because it was that intriguing. Eva is one feisty, strong willed, amazing woman and she is perfect for Gideon. I love her interactions with his family as well. Gideon's and Eva's struggles and tortured souls makes me feel for them so much.  This book brought me through a roller coaster of emotions. Definitely a keeper on my shelf and multiple re-reads. I just love Sylvia's writing and ABSOLUTELY CANNOT WAIT for Entwined with You!!
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|After Episode 1 of the second season of HOMELAND was aired a it appeared that this would be an intensely interesting, psychological thriller. All of the ingredients seem to be present - fine writing (Alex Gansa, Howard Gordon and Gideon Raff), fast paced direction by Michael Cuesta, and a very strong cast including Claire Danes in one of her most challenging roles, Damian Lewis and Mandy Patinkin.<br /><br />The concept is very much in the public eye at this point - a study of how terrorists are followed and found and how the US Intelligence Service functions. The first episode introduced all of the main characters and fleshed out in a single episode the clues for all of the complicated substories and subplots that the series promises. After eight years absence Sgt. Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) was thought MIA but is discovered in a filthy cell in Iraq ad brought back to the US in a Marine Victory parade. Brody had been captured with another Marine who was beaten to death and the reasons why Brody survived and his fellow Marine didn't makes CIA agent Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) suspicious - could Brody have sold out to Iraqi bad guy Abu Nazir (Navid Negahban) and that is how he survived torture and captivity? Mathison is driven to see if her concept is correct, gains the backing of her boss Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin, and successfully fills Brody's house with surveillance equipment so his every move can be observed. The sidebars include the fact that in Brody's absence his wife Jessica (Morena Baccarin) has fallen in love with Brody's best friend Mike (Diego Klattenhoff), and in the intense questioning and shock of being back home Brody begins to remember events of his capture and imprisonment including the fact that he was the one who beat his fellow Marine to death at the behest of Abu Nasir. Brody's physical condition and body language also give signs that perhaps Mathison's concepts that Brody sold out to Abu Nazir and is plotting an attack on America are viable. The stinger is that Carrie is discovered as being on antipsychotic medication since a young girl - making her contributions to intelligence under suspicion. She undergoes therapy including electroshock therapy, lives with her compassionate sister, and since she had stange and seemingly dangerous behaviors she has been let go from her work as an agent. Now with the second season we find a recuperated Carrie, a more convincing Brody who becomes a candidate for Vice President and is now open with his wife and daughter Dana (Morgan Saylor)  about his conversion to Islam, and once again the numbers of events that occur in rapid fire sequence keep us glued to the story. A few new characters - the enigmatic Quinn (Rupert Friend, absolutely brilliant), the suspicious Roya (Zuleikha Robinson), Estes (David Harewood), and even the brief appearance of a character whose significance remains a mystery in  F. Murray Abraham as Dar Adal. The final episode brings Brody back into suspicion at the memorial service of the Vice President Walden (Jamey Sheridan) when a bomb in Brody's car parked outside the CIA building explodes.<br /><br />There is a tense chase and capture of Nazir, and changes which make the relationship between Carrie and Brody bounce up and down. The real test of whether a series will continue is the degree of unanswered questions left to be resolved in the final episode, and this case there are so many unknowns that it makes the anticipation of next session very high. A very successful Second Season.  Grady Harp, December 12viable.

B007UXSPK2|4.0|enjoyed it good flick. nice special effects and story line. would watch again. tc does a good job on these movies.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|John Gresham can always put together a good story. Enjoyed the ending and some of the twists that occurred in it.
B0086700CM|5.0|Fun and amusing when times of bordom. Super clear graphics easy for anyone to play. Can be addicting as well.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|One of the best sit-coms ever but unlike most, there are very few reruns on TV. This set is exactly what I expected.<br />It's great!
B006FH2W4O|5.0|having been an ocean sailor in the past, anything so well written about the sea is compelling. I'm downloading them one by one and it's like eating chocolates one after the other.....can't get enough!
B000YMQI6E|5.0|This is a fabulous flick with Anthony Hopkins at his best. Ryan Gosling is not a great actor and he is exactly the same in every movie. But it works.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Another good Mitch Rapp story.  I would definitely recommend it.  It was a fun read, as always.  You won't be disappointed.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Good movie, good plot, great action scenes.i would recommend this to my friends. It's is a family friendly movie that is fun for everyone.
B003TH14H4|5.0|The characters are all very likable.  There's the whole will they won't they dynamic between Becket and Castle.  It's all quite formulaic, but fun.  So who cares?
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|A nice book to read again as an adult. An easy read but fun read. Important to remember the time it is set in as its very different to modern books.
B002361MLA|5.0|Eye opening (the minds eye that is)  It's nice to know this philosophy truly is reality. I recommend this to all who would like to invite peace into their lives.
1878424777|2.0|I liked the idea behind this book, but I prefer &#34;self help&#34; books that have concrete advice, not talk of floating between clouds, getting rid of black smoke, etc.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book it is the greatest it is the best book in the world I can't wait to read the next book
B006X5L6VS|3.0|It's ok.  Does not locate planets, does not identify by pointing as my Kindle Fire does not have a GPS finction. Does not indicate magnitude or show Messier abjects. Like have a self illuminated star chart...  a not very good star chart.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Moderately entertaining.  Yet another variation on &#34;The Firm,&#34; as was &#34;The Pelican Brief.&#34;  Grisham writes well, and some of his books are really excellent and thought-provoking (e.g. &#34;The Chamber&#34;), but this isn't one of them.
B000YHG72E|4.0|My kids love this movie because Will is so stupid.  He is good at acting stupid.  It is a fun light hearted movie for the whole family!
B001QB5S3G|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies.  I saw it on opening day many years ago, and I continue to re-watch it.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A wonderfully written look at a centuries-old, post-apocalyptic society. It's a fun read with lots of action and characters to get attached to.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|Perhaps this book got better if one could get past the first dozen pages or so, but I am not wasting my time to find out.  The characters struck me as incredibly unlikeable and the writing style was jarring.  There could be a way to take the gist of this story line and make it fun and flirty, but this author simply succeeded in making it gross.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Excellent gift with more than one option! Its nice to send something that can be used as a blue ray when the person receiving it can have both choices.
B0097AQEOK|5.0|THE MUSIC<br />An astonishing body of work from the lady who, in my opinion, ranks among the five best singer-songwriters of all time. Her first (and arguably best) 10 albums are collected here, a substantial, relentlessly brilliant body of work - you won't find a single weak album here.<br /><br />SOUND / REMASTERING.<br />This reissue doesn't bear any information about remastering. The general consensus is that, for some albums, the HDCD remasters (released about a decade ago) have been used. When there was no HCDC version available they have supposedly used the masters from the first CD edition.<br />Anyway: remastered or not, the sound is gorgeous, rich and detailed throughout all of the albums.<br /><br />PACKAGE / ARTWORK<br />The single CDs are presented in quality cardboard foldout sleeves. The original artwork is faithfully reproduced, the printing is vivid and detailed. The outer box, quite sturdy, is simple and elegant. This set has nothing to do with the cheap, flimsy cardboard and the blurred artwork of other budget box sets which are flooding the market these days.<br /><br />A valuable reissue, at a very inexpensive price. This set has obviously been designed with great care and respect for both the music and the listener.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I enjoy all Folletts' books.  There just isn't much &#34;historical fiction&#34; about the WWI period around so this was especially good.  I'm looking forward to reading Volume 2 if the price ever becomes more reasonable.
1441761268|5.0|THIS WAS A REALLY GOOD BOOK. I LOVED THE STORY. THE SLAVE TRADE IS PART OF THE HISTORY OF THE USA & I THINK WE ALL NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS TIME PERIOD. THEY HAD REALLY HARD LIVES, BUT ALSO, WARM & WONDERFUL FAMILY TIES.
B0072NWKEC|5.0|Another police procedural coupled with creeping personal corruption of a good man in a horrible society. What makes this so good is that none of us would behave any better than Detective Gunther if we found ourselves in his situation.
030746363X|4.0|being older in our 60's now it is even harder to lose weight, but not wanting to give up a friend told us about this book. it is a lot of information and frankly did not read hardly any of it, my husband read it I just followed the eating plan. I tried writing down everything I ate from Jan.-Mar. only to lose three pounds on another diet, was so unhappy at all the work and effort but started this new eating plan the first part of April and we both finally lost weight. I lost 35lbs my husband lost 45. during the holidays we did not watch the diet as close but so far have not gained but 2-3 lbs back, we are still following the plan on most days to not gain to much during the cold winter months . . .so the plan does work . . .not a lot of support information on the internet site but you will lose weight if you stick with it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app I could get lost in here for a long time. I use this for ideas and to look at wonderful pictures.
B00127RAJY|5.0|It is kicking my butt!<br />great product<br />would recommend this.. you just need to stick to it!<br />Had me sore for quite awhile.
B007G51UV0|5.0|I am not an experienced computer builder, however, I am not a novice either.  This motherboard handled my build very well for me.  The included manual was clear enough to answer the questions I had about its installation and the installation of the other components.  I found the mouse controlled BIOS different, but easy enough to understand.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great movie, funny and shows girls that they can determine their own fate with out having to go to the extreme.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Worldwide news at your fingertips.  I love this app, it delivers up-to-date concise news that's difficult to find on commercial television or radio.
B001VIMCW4|2.0|I have to say, I was quite disappointed by Bond's showing on this one. The action scenes were edited so much that it was hard to follow, and the cuts between shots were extremely quick. I don't know what were they thinking. Also, the story line is paper thin. A friend told me that this film was written during the Writers Strike of 2007, and that explains a lot...
1455527475|1.0|Written by a guy that was about to get canned and had numerous performance issues, this book is a mockery of non-fiction. The author clearly has an agenda and is bitter about his failures at Goldman, a firm that is the cream of the crop when it comes to the Bulge Bracket banks.
B009KCUX3S|5.0|This book is excellent for starters, its very fun to read and is full of exercises and examples. a must if you are startin in java
B000NTPDSW|5.0|My favorite films remastered and on Blu-Ray! With the exception of the overwrought part 3, this is an excellent addition to my collection and at such an incredible price!
B00632HWOG|2.0|Since yahoo mail put out an update for the app for android phones and my Samsung Galaxy S 3 the phone no longer automatically syncs or gives notification of new email.  Customer support is very difficult to talk to and slow to respond.  No phone support is available at all..  So disappointed.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|idk if this app is supposed to be for little kids or wat but im 13 and i think it s fun lol, but i wish you could choose from more people
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Holy F--- ***, what a f--- twisted film! Content of this review inappropriate? Then you won't like this film. Not even a little. My husband thought it brilliant. I thought it over-the-top.
0920668372|5.0|I think this book is adorable with an intense but true message.  The pictures are very cute and the writing is great.  Read to your kids!  It never hurts to remind your kids how much they mean to you, especially in this book form.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am an avid John Grisham fan. This one had so many twists and turns that I couldn't put it down, yet I didn't want it to end. Glad that I resisted the temptation to stop reading 2/3 of the way through and skip to the last 2 or 3 chapters (as is my usual practice) and find out the ending - then go back and find out how the characters got to where they are in the end!
B0076NKNLA|2.0|Michelle Williams put on a fantastic performance, but I found the movie itself disappointing.  The story line was not very intriguing, and the movie was fairly slow.
B00A2BTCXI|5.0|Moving Pictures you ask? Well sort of.<br /><br />I must admit, that I have no prior/other copy of 2112 on CD so I won't be able to comment on the differences or improvements with this newer version. Actually, I haven't even listened to the included CD, since I bought this CD/BD combo primarily for the HD 5.1 surround experience and I can honestly say it does not disappoint!<br /><br />I understand that everyone's audio system (and ears for that matter) will yield differing opinions, but I've never been a fan of compressed files, don't much listen to music via earbuds, and still enjoy the \\"sweet spot\\" musical listening experience with my Martin Logan speaker set-up in my living room.<br /><br />From the opening notes, the Blu-ray audio experience is enveloping but in a very \\"natural\\" way with Geddy's vocals primarily emanating from the center. While the surrounds are certainly used, they are not independently prominent, so don't expect wacky \\"circulating\\" effects or isolated instruments coming from behind you. Only occasionally may you hear ambient sounds, rainfall perhaps. (This is Rush, not Pink Floyd) What you can expect however, is an immersive sonic experience which should completely fill your room with a noticable clarity from each instrument just as it was recorded. Alex's guitars have an uncluttered tone, raw and ballsy at times, light and delicate at others. And of course Neil Peart's drummming is as always an earful of ungodly talent. Very well done.<br /><br />In addition to the audio treat, you also get a visual one. Moving pictures in the form of a comic-book type of animation that provides the lyrics, but also supplies a bit of story-telling to reveal some of the context in which perhaps the song's ideas were derived. I found it quite captivating, and a feature/experience I would like to see done by other 5.1 Blu-ray releases.<br /><br />But as wonderful as the video enhancements are, I often found myself closing my eyes to eliminate the visual element; to just truly listen to the musical genius that is Rush. 2112 is a monumental album. I'm glad it got the treatment it deserved.; to just truly listen to the musical genius that is Rush. 2112 is a monumental album. I'm glad it got the treatment it deserved.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Really good read.  The books grabs you from the start and keeps you engaged in the story.  Obviously a young adult reader book, but as a &#34;mature&#34; reader, I enjoyed it also.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book is a roller coaster of twists and turns. Incredible intelligence that keeps you on the edge of your seat with each turn. I thought it was a great read and couldn't put it down. I'd give it a 5 star but I wish the ending would have been a bit more.
B003KRLKHC|4.0|Nice story line, good action, held my attention, I could watch it again if a few months and enjoy it all over again.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|BAZINGA.....Knock, Knock, Knock..Penny, Knock, Knock, Knock..Penny, Knock, Knock, Knock..Penny....  Hysterically funny, nerdy but brilliant comedy.  Not for the kiddies thou.
B0081L391C|2.0|Movie was OK I guess, but so much filthy language that I couldn’t enjoy it. Not for the faint of heart.
B008KE3960|4.0|pretty fun little game. fairly easy to play with good instructions not too good graphics but still fun to play
B0034G4P8A|4.0|Entertaining film, more so when the plot develops in Asgard. Chris Hemsworth was born to play Thor. I just wish he should had used the helmet during the action scenes. That would have been more cool. The scenes on earth with Natalie Portman kind of drag and slowed the pace of the film. Natalie Portman (a fine actress) tweeted her acting scenes and to me was unconvincing as this revamped scientist Jane Foster (why they couldn't make her a nurse like in the comicbooks? I am sure that female nurses in the audience would have appreciated that too). Despite my complaints, the film has more pros than cons. Loki is great and Anthony Hopkins as Odin did a wonderful job. can't wait for the sequel.
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|David Fincher has always been one of my favorite directors, and this movie is one of the reasons why. His attention to detail and demand for perfection from the actors and crew are what makes his movies so entertaining to mesmerizing to watch.<br /><br />I love the Criterion edition of this movie. The movie looks and sounds fantastic, and the special features cover every aspect of the making of this movie. Go get it!
B005NPBT5M|5.0|The Finest Civilian Militaristic C.D.C. Perfect Story Album I've EVER Heard!  The Co~Linear Adjustment IN the Music CANNOT BE TOPPED!
B0086700CM|5.0|It is so much fun and when i am bored i play it forever! It is pretty epic. I recommend this app to anyone who has nothing better to do! :)
B004V4H55Y|4.0|Well executed, a tale a minute. Good old fashioned who-done-it. Couple of tales repetitious, for me. Excellent intoduction for the uninitiated.
B005V4FJC4|4.0|Zooey's voice is pure silk.  I'm not overly famliar with M. Ward, but no complaints, and an excellent compliment to Zooey, who really dominates the album (which is fine by me as it's her voice that inspired me to purchase this collection).<br /><br />This is a very relaxing recording, with an old school, almost blusey feel to it.  The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of five is that, for my tastes, I like a Christmas collection to include something religious, something about Christ (after all, that is what Christmas is celebrating).  Including something like Three Kings or Silent Night or Come All Ye Faithful would have been a nice and tasteful addition to an otherwise great selection of songs.  Also, it CD runs a bit &#34;short&#34; at only 32 minutes depsite featuring 12 songs.<br /><br />Overall, would definately recommend.
B002JVWQT6|4.0|Very funny! My husband and I laugh hysterically when we watch this. We would recommend it. We will plan on watching again.
B005OOL1IC|3.0|Like most sequels, this one didn't quite hit the laughs of the first. I recommend red box or TV for this one.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|She has a wonderful voice, mixes well with him. Great choice of songs, I have no problem singing along with them!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This series is by far one of the best I have ever read.  Martin writes characters that warm their way into your heart or annoy you enough to want to keep reading about them.  The plot spins off into new characters, which can be confusing if you go a long time inbetween books, but definitely worth the read.
0930289234|5.0|The product is good good great good good good good good good great great great good good and a great and good book.
B00519YPUQ|4.0|If you are thinking of watching this with kids under 10 think twice. PG in 1988 is VERY different than it is now.
B006MW3V6U|3.0|The content of this series is normally 5 star, but the video streaming quality was terrible so we missed a lot of the dialogue. Not good. I'll only try it again if you give us a credit or refund to do so. Thanks!
B009NPM5Y2|3.0|This IS a cheesy musical type movie but the music is awesome....totally worth watching! I'd rent this again or even buy it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great story, really loved the plot,extremely intricate. THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS STORY LINE  WAS THE BEST I HAVE READ. BUY IT YOUWILL LOVE IT.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|All your questions get answered, the twists and turns will leave you breathless and Mac becomes the strongest person she could be. Great transformation of all the characters who find their strengths, weaknesses and humanity.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book.  I didn't want to put it down.  From coming from a marriage involving abuse, it was something I could relate to and loved her courage.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Love the game, it's fun with friends, and fairly easy to teach, but it was missing pieces... Not sure if that's an assembly line issue or a retailer issue...
B005LW5J9O|2.0|Great topic, poorly organized and written... can't believe this author got published!  I leanred a good deal out of this, however...
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I think this is the best one of the series. Very interesting but not for everyone. Awkward reading in some environments.
B003B02PFO|3.0|This book was chosen as our December read for our book club. We thought it would be upbeat and an easy read during this busy time of the year. Most of us are professionals and we found the book totally lacking believability but not from the protagonist but from the daughter. Her story was just plain ridiculous! We all agreed the best part was the giving away the cruise tickets as that was a sign of the true meaning of Christmas.<br />John Grisham should stick to what he does best....mysteries.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this series and the story just kept getting better and better. A very interesting story line you will enjoy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! It was definitely the best book in the whole series. The last two weren't as good, but you absolutely have to find out what happens next.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|AWESOME!! Once I got past the first 3 shows I got used to it and now I'm hooked!!!! Great show!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great and free app I use on a daily basis on my Kindle Fire. Love the large buttons and layout. Highly recommend!
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|My only complaint about this album is that there aren't more songs on it. I LOVE IT! Reminds of the show every time I listen.
B001AZI1W8|4.0|This concert is very entertaining. Not long but I prefer that. This is definitely the old Rihanna. Fun and not depressing.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|I get picky about holes in plotlines and this movie had some glaring ones. Read the myriad of 3 star reviews and they pretty much cover my feelings on this installment of the franchise.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game can help you survive bordome! It has a lot of fun little mini games in just one game!
1423140605|5.0|This came quickly and in great condition. I am very satisfied with this book order. My son LOVES this series so I'm excited to give this to him at Christmas.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Lots of good discovery twists to the story. It kept me wanting to learn more of Dorothy's past (or Vivien).
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I will keep this video to share with family over holidays. Beautiful portrayal of family passages and hopeful futures that come from unexpected changes in all our lives. Outstanding cast and script.
B007EECSFA|3.0|The Secret Keeper was a good story, but was hard to follow at times. The frequently time lapses between the past and present, between one character and the next, were confusing in the first few chapters. The rest of the book was pretty good. However, this is not one of Kate Morton's better books that she has written.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I heard so many great things about this Trilogy.  I honestly couldn't get through the first one and put it down.  It just isn't for me.
0385528752|3.0|Leadership books are a dime a dozen these days.  But whenever a good buddy recommends a book, I'm eager to dig in.  Especially when that friend is a time-tested leader.<br /><br />Switch is a book about change.  We all know how difficult it is to motivate people to change.  The Heath brothers present a basic strategy for instilling change in the life of an organization.  The principles are backed with credible research and are supported with real life examples.<br /><br />The most helpful ingredient in Switch is the central truth, namely - leaders must engage both the rational and emotional sides of people in order for change to be implemented in a way that benefits an organization.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|The movie was way to long... Not as good as the first two. Bane is supposed to be a lot bigger than he was in the movie. Awful villain. No comparison to Heath Ledger.
B004YM6JI2|3.0|I love Supernatural. BUT Season 7 was very, very, disappointing. I think I liked maybe 4-5 episodes out of the whole season. Also the episode with Charisma Carpenter and the guy who played Spike in Angel played. Their acting skills haven't gotten any better. Especially Charisma's. I really didn't want to rate the season as high as I did, but I do love the show overall.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The story was interesting and provocative (left me thinking about how people go about their lives), but I felt like the writing could have been a little tighter in spots. Ending left me with mxed feelings.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|not really what i was expecting.<br /><br />kinda got slow at times.<br /><br />A little bit unbelievable.<br /><br />i gotta type one more word.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|It is very simple. Didnt like it much. I thought it would have different rings or color layout but i guess you have to pay for that.
B006ZS4FE8|5.0|I've got it all ready for my grand daughter to play with. She is 4 and we only have a few hours to play...so I built it for her to play with @ our house. I want the entire village now!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The story line was very believable...and touching. It's when you stop wanting and looking for love, that it shows up.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|Ted had heavy marketing as a foul Seth MacFarland movie, but it fell short in my opinion.  Yes, Ted has some bad habits, but the comedy falls flat.  Ted really isn't that interesting, the pacing is somewhat boring, as well as the characters.  Family Guy for the silver screen didn't translate.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|this movie is a great action movie for everyone who enjoyed these stars in their many movies its awesome to see them all together
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game didn't sound like something that would entertain me for as long as it does. I love how distracting this game is when I'm trying to kill time.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game, it is frustrating but I love it.  Haven't gotten very for but I will keep trying
B000YHE4AG|4.0|I am by no means a Will Ferrell fan, but he is a great fit for this movie. Watch this movie pretty much every holiday season and it always gets me to laugh a bit.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|What have you gotten yourself into this time?  Watch to find out, and I am sure you will be impressed.
B005UA0FLE|4.0|Great album.  Only wish there were a few more songs.  Bonus track offered for buying the entire album is a 4 second &#34;Merry Christmas&#34; from Bubl&eacute;.
1451695187|4.0|It would have been easy for this guy to give up and give up the body, as he was about to be declared brain dead. Eben Alexander demonstrates tremeandous courage to return with a glimpse for the living of what lies beyond death.  Some of his narrative tests the frontiers of imagination, invoking challenging new paradigms, unexplored regions for which language has yet to be developed.  A book worth sharing.
B00574P9EQ|4.0|It is a Christmas gift not given yet. I'm sure it is a great movie. He will enjoy it! a
B004TI5N38|5.0|David Baldacci has never failed to write a book that I enjoy reading.  Zero Day is no exception.  Highest recommendations from this reader.
034580404X|5.0|I love the softcover larger books, and these books are great. Especially the first two, really catch your interest. A little slower going on the third book for me, but still a great read.
1594135851|4.0|The first book was good and this is a little better.  However, I was relatively shocked at how easily Katness and Peeta accept their faith to return to the Arena.  There are, in my views, a few inconsistencies and suspension of disbelief in this book, but good over all.  I'm finishing Destined for Oblivion: As nature intended now, an extremely good book so far, too.  Then, I'll read the third Hanger Games book and see.<br /><br />I hope that help.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Acting excellent - enjoyed plot and staging.<br />I did not like the packaging - wondered if it were an authorized copy as it was so flimsy!
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Love the sherlock holmes movies. Can't go wrong buying this, and at a great price too. The second one was as good as the first.
B0085YNML2|5.0|I would recommend this game to everyone--kids, adults, teens, vampires even. It's fun, it's so cute, and it's a puzzle.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|A horror series that fills the long time void from the 80s!  Tales from the Darkside, Tales from the Crypt, Alfred Hitchcock, Ray Bradbury...  I grew up with all those, and haven't found a replacement since.  American Horror Story is a modern, rated R version, of the Greats I grew up with.  Not to mention, it's an entire SEASON of one continual story, with more character development, a complicated plot, and actual actors that can act.  What a concept.  A well-acted, well-written, horror story.  Finally... the void is filled.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This newest addition to the Jack Ryan saga does not disappoint.  The passing of the torch to a new generation in this story line is every bit as exciting as previous instalments.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I can't believe this movie is considered the best comedy of the year. It has very few comedy moments and lots of corny moments.... Very disappointing
B0063GORYU|5.0|I've used this app both in the Apple and Android version -- and it is the best version of spider solitare out there.  The game is zippy, the scoring statistics are good, and it is fun to change the card background (Apple only, so far) and board background (both Apple and Android).  The ads are non-intrusive, and sometimes clever; I don't mind them at all.<br /><br />congrats to MobilityWare for delivering a first-class product!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Excellent story of personal life experiences mixed with history of North and South Korea.<br /><br />Shocked that people can be treated so cruelly emotionally and physically. These camps need to be destroyed and people freed.
B005H0CBZ0|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I am a very fussy reader and find it difficult to get into a book, but I was hooked on this book from the start, will continue to read Diana Gabaldon for sure.
B000EXZI1O|5.0|I loved this album growing up and it's just as good now!  Their voices are golden....I highly recommend to any BeeGees fan.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|The movie had no real plot and just unnecessary fowl language.I actually liked Bad Santa more than I liked this movie.
B000001EYW|5.0|I think this is one of their best albums--Sexy and seductive lyrics, upbeat tempos, it has it all! An excellent way to remember the BeeGees' latest works. I would highly recommend to anyone, not just BeeGees fans.
1401301010|5.0|The stories are so real. Gives you the mindset that you are living his story while reading, and you enjoy the life, despite it's uncommon nature. I recommend to anyone. I rarely finish books, but I finished this one in no tyme. I wanted to keep reading. Perfect book.
B00005B6C9|4.0|While I am a die-hard BeeGees fan, there is one song on this album that irks me. But the rest are golden melodies. And if you are lucky enough to have the CD that plays as a DVD, the Video is really fun. It takes you back a long time ago (when they were quite young) and much later when they were all grown men,  horsing around. That's why I gave it 4 Stars, there was no 4 and 1/2 Stars. When all is said and done, it is a very good album.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Arrived quickly and although I haven't viewed it, I know my mom will love the original and colored version. This is a great deal for the price, 2 movies plus all the extras.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Breaking Bad is a great series and Season 4 does not disappoint.  Highly recommend it to anyone who already has the first 3 seasons.
B002XXLKHY|5.0|My fiance was never a fan of Will Ferrell so we didn't see this movie until two years ago... now it's one of our favorites!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Great new Sherlock show. Huge fan of Sherlock Holmes and he is played brilliantly here. Cases are interesting. Can't wait to see how other major characters of the series are portrayed.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Hard to put down because of all the action.  Mitch Rapp is one talented guy.  This is a story that could truly happen
B006BXTOFC|5.0|I'am a child of the seventies and a music nut- this album reminds me of the music we listened to back then (and now) with a new twist! Love this band and think they are doing great things!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Good function, smooth, and easy to use. Haven't gotten in depth with it but seems capable of more than simple math.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I have to say that I have paid money to watch all 4 of the Twilight movies... that being said, I think Kristen Stewart is an annoyingly poor actress, making this movie a HUGE disappointment. I love Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth. But even so, I felt there wasn't enough character and plot development. I didn't feel like I got to know the characters enough to understand the \\"why\\"'s. So, that made all the cool fight scenes disconnected from the story that I felt the director was trying to stress more on the graphics and \\"creepy\\" feel from the witch and the fighters. I was bored halfway through the movie, sad to say.
B006885LZM|5.0|If you liked Band of Brothers you'll like Pacific.  GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD A
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I got this game out of curiosity.  I kept seeing all the merchandising for it all over the place, so I decided to try it.  Now I,m having a hard time putting it down.  It is a good mix between a shooting game and a puzzle.
B004UID2LC|3.0|Layout a little different but from what I've seen it's youtube. a a a a a a a a a
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|If you can enjoy some obnoxious adult humor as depicted in Family Guy then you'll like the live action version of it.  In case you're curious, this is not suitable for children.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Easlier review stuff. But lacks some features avaliable on the web site.  A A A A A A A A
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Movie was funny and entertaining and would watch it again. This movie wasn't only humorous but has action and a sense of adventure to it. The romantic dialog was well written.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyed the book, but early on figured out part of the plot. However, Grisham's books are always enjoyable to read.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|Excellent performances all around.  The principals were all excellent and witty.  The script is excellent.  I especially enjoyed seeing Claire Bloom and Anthony Andrews, great actors I hadn't seen for a while.
0143038419|1.0|On an emotional level, I can relate to Ms. Gilbert's downspin and subsequent plight. However, this book seemed to repeat her emotional issues in a rather melodramatic (and weak) manner. The book read to me as if it were strictly therapeutic - you know, when depressed, resort to jotting your issues in your journal!<br />Her self-deprecating manner is also irritating. Is she not learning anything through this journey? I recognize that perhaps the first portion of the book is attempting to present her emotional and mental state during that period of her life; however, we most decidedly Get The Point. The poor Point is shredded to within an inch of its pitiful life. There are glimmers of hope and beauty; some of her chapters on Italy are delightful and insightful. It is fascinating to read about another culture, and should I ever travel to Italy, I know where to eat. Still, this reader struggled to make it through Italy. Will life improve in India? Great buckets of hope!<br /><br />And...no. They don't improve in India. If I had to choose a word for this chapter, the underlying theme seems to be FRUSTRATION. She is frustrated with her perceived failed attempts at meditation, and again with the 182 verse chants. As well, I should have expected it coming, yet was still surprised when she WENT TO THE BATHROOM TO CRY! Her issues with control (thank you for trying to help her by pointing this out, Richard from Texas) seem to be amplified in this section. In Italy, Gilbert was fine meandering around aimlessly, seeming disinterested in control. But in India, in an Ashram of all places, Gilbert is trying to control the heck out of her head and her situation. The poor woman is trying so hard that she's trying herself into a frenzy!<br /><br />There was one chapter that delved deep philosophically; that chapter brightened the way and gave me hope for the book. Then she went back to crying in the bathroom, so hopes have been yet again dashed. I'm plodding through, and I'm going to make it, but Gilbert is making it pretty darn hard to get there. All I can say is: Indonesia had better be great gobs of glorious, 'else this book's going to get one of the worst ratings ever from me - and I don't rate things poorly, as a general rule.<br /><br />When she's in Indonesia, her attitude seems to have improved. However, as with the rest of the book, I'm struggling because it is so darned boring! Again, there are glimmers when she delves into philosophy or history or interesting tidbits with travel or food. But mostly it's about her, much of it mundane and typical, which makes for a very blah read.<br /><br />I would not be able to recommend this to anyone. There are too many negative or boring parts; not enough of interest or positivity to outweigh the negative. Many Zzzzzs, and no thumbs up.make it, but Gilbert is making it pretty darn hard to get there.

B008HK3XKO|5.0|I had a case for a previous 7&#34; tablet. When I got the Kindle Fire HD, I discovered that it didn't fit, I did an on-line search and bought this case. It works perfectly. The tablet snaps it easily and securely. It is very convenient to use and very protective. I highly recommend it.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|This was recommended to me by a friend and now I would like to recommend it to everyone. Very clever and just plain fun to watch. Though the show deviates from Doyle's work a good bit the pacing and intelligence are just as good.
B000FC10WU|5.0|Liked the book a lot. Very suspensefull. I remember reading it years ago, but it was just as good the second time around.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|It's Patricia Cornwell...just more good reading. I'm a writer myself and look to her for inspiration, so it works well.
B0018OFN4U|4.0|And did I mention zombies.  If you've never seen this check it out for a light look at one zombie survial scenerio.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|this movie was awesome, made us cry chick flick but really enjoyed wated it with the family. i would watch it again
0394800389|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite books to read to my children.  I like reading slowly to them or with them to really feel how the words roll around in your mouth.  The various sound combinations are good for helping children annunciate.  They you can challenge yourself to see how fast you can read it without making mistakes.  For some reason whenever I read this a few times, I cant help but get faster and faster the more times I read it.
0788859544|5.0|This is one of our all time favorite movies, I really enjoyed watching this with my kiddos and we loved it alot.
0307592731|1.0|I was really surprised by the lack of gratitude in this book.  Dumb luck and the kindness of strangers made this journey possible, but the author seems to take this for granted.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|While most outstanding questions were resolved, it was devastating to experience the deterioration and destruction of people's minds, bodies and homes.
B000V63BN6|5.0|Whats not to love about Stevie Wonder and this CD. I have been playing Sir Duke everyday since I purchased it.  I just wish As was a part of this.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Hate the time line. and can not turn it off. privacy is not private. they can do what they want
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Easy, intuitive, flexible. I wonder how I could have spent any time<br />at all trying to find a good alarm clock.
0385535147|3.0|I like most of Grisham's books, but this was not one of his best.  I guess its tough putting trying to satisfy the publisher with one or two books a year.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Gone Girl is an amazing read, it had me from page one! The characters are so well written and the story flows so well. It has definately become one of my favorite books and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a smartly written thriller.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|it doesn't always load then new news feed. but overall it works good!!!  definitely a very worth while app.to have
B002SQFZ68|5.0|I had seen Bon Jovi in concert a couple of years ago and this bluray is very close to a live performance you are going to get. The audio/video is spectacular on this bluray.  Of course you need a home theater to experience it in all its glory but well worth the price of admission.  A must for any Bon Jovi fan!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I really enjoyed Bruno Mars' first cd and was looking forward to this one. It doesn't disappoint! Love the different styles of music and I don't think there's one song I don't enjoy.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Excellent Scifi movie for the whole family! Absolutely fun to watch with kids. The story on the human side is a little weak but everything else is good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Caught by the story. Well written. Just loved the book.<br />If you start reading it you will read the complete trilogy!
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Fantastic Cover! This is sturdy hard plastic that fits snuggly around my iphone. I have purchsed both the white and black cases and both are great. I like the swirling design on the white / clear one.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|Just loving this album. Highly recommended. &#34;Castle of Glass&#34; and &#34;Lost in the Echo&#34; are my favorite tracks. Definitely worth the money I paid.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Like nothing I've ever read before. Kudos to Mitch Albom for changing up his outine. Don't worry be happy be yourself accept challenges.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|A good family Christmas movie... teaches that everyone is important, and we all have different gifts. Fun, entertaining and thoughtful
B002SF9YUM|5.0|Watching Little Ashes brings out emotions in the viewer - sympathy, heartache, happiness, and desparation. I bought the DVD after seeing the film twice. The first time was an eye-opening experience. The second time was an emotional experience. The actors bring the characters to life - the emotional experience is almost tangible. Love in a time when real love was forbidden, and longing in a time when heartache was the only option. The swimming scene with Federico Lorca (Javier Beltran) and Salvador Dali (Robert Pattinson) is magical. The actors express the freedom of Lorca and Dali - a freedom that ignores the social and polical restrictions of the time. I recommend this film to anyone who FEELS films like I do. (Along the same tones as Immortal Beloved and A Room With A View.)
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|If you're craving more 50 shades, this is somewhat along the same lines.  Minus such graphic &#34;encounters&#34;.  A good, easy read.
B00004WG2F|5.0|Legends of the Fall is a well-told story of family - the love and hopefullness that comes with togetherness, and the despair that comes from heartache and breakup. This film will fill you with a range of emotions as you follow the love and loss of the Ludlow family. The actors are superb. Each actor truly becomes the character he or she plays. A classic.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I've read all 3 of Gillian Flynn's books.  All good reads, but this was my least favorite.  Wasn't quite the page turner like the others.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|When you want to pass some time, why don't play songs on your keyboard kindle? I like it a lot.
B0076DELIG|4.0|It may be that like bosh, Connely may be tired, but it is still a good grip them thriller. I would like to see more interaction with Mickey Haller, another Lincoln Lawyer book or two would be a good way to allow Connely tobring us back a good Bosch book. I have read them all and Connely is amongst my favourite authors
B001CZJKS0|1.0|The term \\"box set\\" refers to \\"complete\\"...<br />Why wasn't Halloween II included in the box set!?<br /><br />The packaging is worth more than movies. Furthermore,  when my wife and I had people over to watch the Halloween Box set,  we couldn't watch Halloween II...<br /><br />I  know, shouldn't assume...<br /><br />Total scam...
B007HACDLK|5.0|Flynn as usual is spot on on current events. Mitch is showing signs of humanity and vulnerability. I would love to see  Rapp in another thriller where he goes about whacking bad guys with a suppressed FN 5.7
B005LAII1C|5.0|The movie scene had been missing a movie like this for quite a long time. After many months of simply ignoring new movies coming out in theatre, this one intriged me and it did not disappoint. So happy to be finally have it to own now and highly recommend for anyone looking for a good laugh! I hope they make a Ted 2 !
B000MD9UJC|5.0|This kit really improves the light given off by a standard mini mag.  One word of caution...a LED has polarity so if you plug it in backwards it won't work.  You simply have to reverse the bulb if this is the case.  The push button switch also helps to eliminate always being told &#34;hey your light's on&#34;.
B003B02O14|4.0|It was an engaging read, from beginning to end.  We had visited the Gulf Coast within the last couple of years and some of the places mentioned in the book were familiar to me, this really added to my enjoyment.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Great besides Kristen Stewart! Not your average love story Snow White movie and can be watched with the family and friends
0425252868|5.0|My reactions to the book, A Higher Call, after an initial perusing is that the human spirit is compassionate ,<br />recognizing and admiring the response to challenges that others may face.  The actions of the pilots that<br />December day reflect the spirit of the soul and the common bond of airmen since men and women first rose into<br />the celestial.  Duty to one's conscience is always a higher calling!
1451695195|5.0|Wonderful book - the only problem I had was in the manufacturing of it - the inside pages are upside-down from the cover. Again, a manufacturing issue - nothing to do with the story or author.<br /><br />The content of the book is amazingly remarkable and a story that everyone should read.  Eben's journey into God is sacred and holy, and we should all rejoice in hearing from this modern prophet of the eternal life that awaits us all!  God is truly calling each of us into a relationship with God and deepening of love for God and for the human family.<br /><br />Blessing of Christ,<br />Rev. Cathy Brewton
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|Novel plot idea.  Story line was interesting but not on the edge of your seat excitement.  Actors' performances were satisfactory.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I liked this book because it taught me something about life.  I didn't particularly like the mythical part, but I suppose that has to be part of the story; how the two characters came together and how it ended was great..
B003XRELGQ|5.0|It's hard to pick out a single Vonnegut book everyone should read, but this would be near the top of my list.  The question of religion is addressed in this book much to my liking. &#34;Live by the [lies] that make you brave and kind and healthy and happy&#34;.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Great for a back-up charger for the Kindle Fire HD, it is good if you use your Kindle in public. Keep one for the home and one on the go!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book as much as the others that I've read by Sylvia Day. She is a great author.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book it kept me wanting to read more and more hope she writes more books like this.
0307120007|2.0|Being a book for babies, I was not expecting it to be so flimsy.  The book is bound with a cheap plastic spine and looks as if it will be torn apart within hours of gifting.  Also, the &#34;mirror&#34; is very poor quality, the baby definitely won't recognize themselves in it.  If I had seen an actual picture of this book, not just the cover, I would not have made the purchase.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This is a show that keeps you on edge all the time.  I have yet to come across a dull/slow episode.  I know some people said this season wasn't as good as season 1 but I tend to disagree.  There may not have been as many walker encounters but the internal tensions still made it good TV.  This is a show that has a regular cast yet nobody is safe (reminds me of 24) which adds alot to the tension.  I would recommend this show 100% to anyone who likes or even sort of likes zombie shows.  Do not watch if you are squeemish!!!  My mother who is 78 really likes this show as well. Great writing and cast combined with excellent zombie make-up makes this a great exciting tension filled show to watch. ( I tend to talk to the TV alot with this show)
B0076DELIG|4.0|Just finished this newest book. It has the grit and darkness that we've come to expect, with a surprisingly human side of Hieronymus Bosch in this installment. It ended too abruptly for me, which may have more to do with me just wanting more than any problem with the plot. Don't make it your first Connelly - get Concrete Blond or another early book - but it is still excellent reading and Connelly continues to be an American treasure.
B000YHG72E|4.0|Funny movie at this time of year. It was fun to listen to the kids laugh throughout. Good holiday movie
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Very funny! I really liked Ted's Boston accent and different Boston sayings that he used. Would definitely recommend this movie!
030759565X|5.0|Wonderful recipes and beautiful photos. Can't wait to try every one of them. Deb Perelman is so creative and I would love to meet her.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is my favorite genre, and I am a dedicated Vince Flynn / Mitch Rapp fan.  So of course I liked The Last Man.  But I gave it 5 stars because this particular book (out of the series) was so current and relevant.  I had to keep reminding myself that this is fiction :) Would be nice to know there really is someone like Mitch Rapp in the Government.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer was a page turner. I had trouble putting it down. A great read on a long plane ride.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Am nearly finished with this book.  I read in bed and struggle to keep my eyes open after a while because I don't want to stop reading.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good book to read, sad that the story ended, but it was a nice ending to it. Recommend for all adults.
0896898288|5.0|This book is great! As a whole the quilt is just awesome but they have so many patterns that you can take and make up you own. The history is the book is fun to learn about as well.
B009CFZLK8|5.0|Unbeatable action, with amazing attention to detail.  I don't think many consider that you really do need to take the cap off of the ball point pen before you use it to stab your assailants hand.<br /><br />Also a true story of self-discovery...and love.
0425263908|5.0|This book is a must read, i ordered the second one as an ebook. If you liked 50 shades you will like this book too.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|My family enjoys watching it every year and it never seems to get old.  One of the best &#34;Vacation&#34; movies in my opinion.
B008602KQI|4.0|loved movie but didn't read the book! hope you enjoy it as well!  wouldn't let young kids watch under 6 years of again!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I love this story and in these difficult times I think we all need to stop and reflect on where we came from, who we are now and how we can be better people in the future.
B004BCT2HU|5.0|David Garrett is mesmerizing. It is hard to describe such talent. It is wonderful from the beginning to the end and I keep watching it over and over. I am so glad that I discovered David Garrett.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Still reading, but thouroughly emjoying  Threat Vector. Clancy, please keep 'em coming!  Always look forward to sitting down with a Clancy, as they are such a good read.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|Very enjoyable, with some unpredictable twists and turns. You won't regret picking this book up...I recommend it highly and hope you enjoy it.
B009E9R2OK|5.0|Very well done concert film and CD. Celebration Day clearly demonstrates that Led Zeppelin could still tour today. Hope they reconsider.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Have only played this game for a couple of days, but like it.  Fun game to play.  Does require concentration and is becoming more difficult.  A good challenging game.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|A good challenge!  Have always enjoyed this type of game, however not a big fan of timed games,  Takes a great deal of concentration.
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|This is one of the great classics starring two of my favorite classis stars. The storyline is well written and the performances by two of the greatest and most underappreciated stars (Wayne and Mitchum) as well as by a young Kahn, were fantastic.
B009LRE040|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie! I think that it was pretty good and look forward to more movies to come from the director.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I really want this game for my kindle but i refuse! I've already played it, I know its fun, but I think its funny Amazon how it goes from $2.99 now 99&cent;. I feel sorry who ever got this game at first and got ripped off so that is why I'm waiting patiently for the free. I bought bad piggies for 2.99 then here come the next week later its free. Not making that mistake again. Amazon you cant fool me.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It adds, subtracts, multiplies and divides - everything you need in a calculator.  Not bad for a free app, give it a look
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|One of my ALL time FAVORITE books!  Love this story.  It had me completely tore up in parts but only because I don't like to see anyone feeling hurt.  I like everything wrapped up nicely with a pretty bow.  In the end that is what we got!  Can't say enough good things about this book!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This novel is interesting since it's written in testimonial form that don't necessary go together, but they add up to give you a well rounded story about the Zombie War. I greatly recommend it since before the Walking Dead, I had never read anything remotely similar to this.
B0099114WO|1.0|I was so utterly disappointed in this movie.  Sure, I'm younger, but thought the story looked like a good one.  The actors, classic.  I wrongfully assumed this movie could not be bad.  I was wrong.  Boring, slow, not as funny as expected. My husband and I nearly walked out of this movie and we never do that. We stayed hoping for more but got nothing out of it in the end. I don't suggest buying it.  Go the one-time rental route if you feel you must, but buying it would be a waste, as I'm pretty sure you would not want to sit through it more than once and torture yourself.  I feel bad for writing such a poor review for such amazing actors, but this is a movie I just can't support.  Heck, it doesn't support itself.
B005IA9K2G|5.0|My favorite movie. I have seen the movie at least 20 times, but enjoy it everytime. Judy Garland's voice is irreplaceable.
B008R14YBK|5.0|Product arrived fairly quick. The BM cd is a Christmas gift, so has not been opened and used yet. .
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Be patient with this book...the beginning, much like the Steig Larsson books requires information & set-up, but about 40 pages in it really starts to roll!!!<br />Loved this book because it combines a rich historical base with vampires, witches & daemons.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|My daughter and I love this movie. She is only 14 and I am 50 and even though there is big age gap, we both feel this is one of the very best movies we have ever seen. I very heartfelt, from laughter to tears to redemption, a must see! Could watch it over and over again. Bought an extra copy just so if anything happened to the first dvd we would have a back up. That is how good it is!!! Blessings!
B007V65R54|5.0|Overall a very interesting read. He makes some great points on what not to do when trying to predict outcomes. Plus this contains a very sensible, rational approach that clearly works in the real world.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love minecraft but this one needs the following.....caves,armor, buckets,signs,large chests,and the nether. thoes things would help tor company get more money ,and people would love you even more than that allready do thankyou I love this app....
B009KS4XRO|5.0|love this app; especially that it lets me play with my friends on fb! no loading issues plays perfect on my kindle fire!
B004LM72ZY|5.0|The rocket is just the right size and not to heave for my 2 year old. He can take it apart and put it together himself. I like that unlike other rockets it doesn't make sounds or have flashing lights, he has to use his imagination when playing with this toy.
B004EKCNMA|3.0|I was reviewing this as a teacher to show 3-5 grade students.  Special effects were great, but I thought the dialogue was a times a little hard for them to follow.
B009VB97EY|1.0|I thought I would at least enjoy this movie for the eye candy but it was so boring and the plot so flat the naked guys couldn't even make up for the writing.
B0090SVDO0|5.0|I love this cd! I was looking for this in bootleg format until i found out it was a legal release!  I've waited for this on cd for a long time!
B0061JPYX2|4.0|I know that this album was probably thrown together from outtakes and other unreleased material after Amy's death.  Some of the music is not her best, but I still enjoyed many of these songs and other takes on previously released songs.
B00A0R02HO|5.0|Jessica Biel is hot. This is a very entertaining movie with great special effects. Better plot than the original. A dark look into the future (perhaps not so distant future???)
B009MB682W|5.0|It's very simple - If you're a Bond fan, it's a must buy.  From Dr. No to Quantum of Solace.  It was made before Skyfall so you'll need to by that track as well, but it makes a complete Bond soundtrack.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Would be nice if it could figure out where you are automatically using GPS.  Need to manually set and configure just about evrything.  They should take a look at Weather Bug, which is what I will stick with.  At least Weather Bug knows where I am and what the weather is.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I read this after seeing the movie, Lincoln, and I highly recommend experiencing both.  Goodwin's ability to give the reader insight into the personal history of each of the individuals makes for an exciting read.
B00AE2J93I|4.0|Enjoyed the time with the grand kids, but found this to be just another \\"ghost and goblins\\" cartoon. Glad I chose to rent father than buy.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book is awesome, can't say it enough. Read this or regret it! Couldn't put it down until it was finished
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Enjoyed the book, was very good, always very original ideas with respect to magic. The book immerses you in a world, and the story is very well told
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|I found this fun to watch but like so many movies these days, it's a kiddy flick, which ultimately lacks substance.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have been playing this daily for months, and have compared it to everything else available, and there is no comparison. The others don't come within a light year of this. If you like Solitaire, this is the one to get!
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I really am hooked on this game. I have to force myself to stop playing so I can, hahaha, live my life.
0345803485|5.0|I really enjoyed reading Fifty Shades of Gray, would recommend this book to anyone. It is a very good book to read.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|this was a good book. it kept me interested and i could not put the  book down. It also was funny.
B005V4FJC4|4.0|Very retro sound. I love Zooey's voice but some of the songs were a bit cheesy. Overall it's a worthy addition to your Christmas collection!
B009ZE27US|1.0|first I was 24 and then I was 47... not worth downloading. This app is a waste of time and space on your device
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This trilogy has me hooked. I questioned it at first but now I know I love it and I can't wait to read more.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I use this app a lot and I really like being able to download utube videos and not have to use wick the only thing I would change is make it so you can go back it gets annoying having to X out to go back one page
B001NLL0RW|4.0|Very entertainng book.  Very long, but I loved it.  Took a while to get it going, but then I couldn't put it down.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Bought this as a gift for a friend who doesn't have Showtime.  Great price for this series ($20)  She texted me the other day to say &#34;OMG!  This show is amazing!!&#34;  Um, yes, sweetie.  I told you!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|From the beginning, it was engaging yet unclear as to what exactly was going on.  The suspense and the mystery held up to the very end.  I usually can guess what is going on, if the butler did it, etc. in most books.  Not here.  The ending tied everything together in a satisfying way without seeming contrived.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|I'm late to this party,  I know, but I did want to note how audacious this show is.  Having an unreliable, even obnoxious, protagonist is just the beginning.  Every opportunity to engage in spy-suspense cliche-mongering is cleverly side-stepped.  Every person  resists characterization as simple good/evil, friend/enemy, sympathetic/alienating.  Congratulations to all involved!
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|If you are a fan of family guy type humor then you will definitely enjoy this film.  Many of the elements of the film mimic that of the show.  There is, of course, still a love story behind all of the humor but over all an entertaining flick.  My girlfriend does not watch Family Guy and really enjoys the 'Romantic Comedy' genre, she enjoyed the film but the really crude humor was enjoyed more thoroughly by myself than her.
B009CPES4I|2.0|When HD first came out, I predicted that it would be the end of several TV/movie careers: David Hasellhoff as a 30-something leading man, Regis Philbin as anything, for example,<br /><br />I didn't predict that actors would just swallow their vanity (they are actors, after all) and parade their wrinkles for the Hi-Def cameras.  I sympathize somewhat, since I'm chronologically in the same zip code, but short of their being in need of the money, I see no reason for them to participate in projects like this.  We count on the people emoting on screen being a lot better looking than us.  We can tolerate Judi Dench as &#34;M&#34; but not as a love interest.<br /><br />Please let us have our cinematic fantasies!
B001QWBM62|5.0|Great quality, easy to use. Excellent sound. Does everything it says it can do. Much easier than dealing with a PC to record jam sessions and practice.
B008ASLNN2|3.0|Love everything about the movie -- the director, the actors, the characters -- but it does not have much truly exciting about it.  Perhaps it's time to give the obnoxious genius shtick a rest.
B0076DELIG|4.0|A good book but not up to Connelly's usual level.  The flashback plot seemed a little gimmicky and contrived.  I love the Harry Bosch character, but he just seemed to be pulling too many rabbits out of the hat in this one.  I would have given it three stars, but every author deserves a break occasionally, especially when he's had so many winners.
B005721W9O|5.0|I love it..<br />The kids love it..<br />Blue Ray version is the way to go (so you can run the audio soundtrack in Thurmian!)<br /><br />Highly reccomend it!
B000OLRH10|4.0|Thank you for a timely and good product and packaged in an appropriate manner.  This is an enjoyable movie and is worth seeing. I would readily recommend this movie to anyone.
B003B02PEU|5.0|I have enjoyed all the Grisham books I have read except Skipping Christmas.  He gets you hooked in the first page and keeps me there until I am finished with the book.  Just ordered The Partner after i completed Juror.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Thank you for a timely and good product which was appropriately packaged. It was very moving and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would not hesitate to recommend to anyone.
B009AP2G26|5.0|This wouldn't be my FAVORITE season... only b.c my fav characters aren't in high school anymore, therfor aren't your main characters anymore... but this season is still great! Def recommend it! LOTS of amazing, new, cast members.... with incredible voices!
B0011HOEY4|3.0|Thank you for a timely and good product which was packaged appropriately. This is an enjoyable movie and from an an African American perspective quite interesting.
B000K4WLXA|5.0|I bought this copy to replace my old one which was lost in a move. I had a choice between this one or the original version that I had had previously. I decided it was worth the extra few bucks and I was right. The little novel that comes with it is an extension of the storyline and tells you what Barret and Cid were doing during the intervening time. In short, I love this movie and - if you don't have a Blu-Ray to get the other version (FFVII Complete) - it's a great purchase for the price.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is super fun and addicting! I cant wait to try flow bridges. its a good timewaster. its so FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0056BC9WA|5.0|I Really like Pitbull and this download is no exception.  It really gets the heart racing especially if you are running
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle has worked hard and it shows. Her voice is beautiful in this collection of some of the greatest Broadway songs of all time. Backed by the London Philharmonic no less. Perfect in every way as far as I can tell. I left this CD in my wife's car as she went off to do some errands. I told her to listen to it and tell me what she thought. She loved it totally and when I asked her who it was, she couldn't venture a guess. When I told her it was Sarah Boyle, she was dumbfounded. Susan seems to have worked very hard on her voice. Her range is better, her pitch is better, and her tonals are resonant and rich. The arrangements were complex and she performed them flawlessly. If this is an indication of what we can expect for the future from her, watch out!! Susan Boyle has arrived! She is the real deal. This CD is a must have for lovers of Broadway show stopping tunes.
B005LJETYI|5.0|It takes a lot to get me interested in written word stories. I'm more of a movie or television kind of guy. I ran into this book randomly and I'm very very glad I did. This book should really be more popular.<br /><br />It's funny, romantic, and epic. I wish I had better review writing skills rather than just saying &#34;i love it&#34; a billion times.<br /><br />When I first read this in the first page I felt like I was watching a movie and that it could easily transition into one or an anime. I love time loop type stories and this gives a fresh take on the whole groundhog day thing.<br /><br />It's a very quick read as well. I own both the paperback and the kindle because I love it so much haha.<br /><br />This author should really write more books.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy is completely worth the price. Now I wonder how the movies will depicted all of the gruesome details in books two and three.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Neat game.  Keeps me entertained.  The suspense of waiting to find out what dragon you are breeding keeps the game interesting.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I waited a day after I read the book to review.  Another amazing book by Colleen Hoover.  At 25% in I thought I guessed what was going to be revealed.  I was wrong..Well I got part of it right.  I love the books that keep you guessing. I loved Sky.  I thought she was a believable main character. I loved holder.  Think I may have a bit of a crush.  Amazing book what more can I say?
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book begins as any murder mystery, setting up the scene and then asking, &#34;who done it?&#34;  However, it then begins a set of twists and turns that are completely unpredictable and compel you to keep turning pages.  I couldn't wait to finish the book to solve the mystery, yet when it was over I was left wanting more.  I can't wait to read more by this author.
1608871088|5.0|A snazzy cover, a gorgeous variety of art styles, in-depth character overviews, and a snippet of the story-boarding process with 3D models - everything I would expect to reside in an art book and more. A feast for the eyes and imagination. I'll never regret buying this!
B0015DROBO|1.0|I have tried and tried to read this book.  I just could not get into it.  I think it was a combination of the foreign names that distracted me from the story (because I like to know the correct pronunciation), and the legal details that are thrown at you in the first chapter.  My goal was to finish the book before I watched the movie but that did not happen.<br />Since I have seen the movie, which I loved, I think I will try to read this one more time.  However, it has been on my kindle for over a year...
B008QTVNUI|4.0|I was missing this episode from my DVR recordings so I purchased from Amazon.com. It was simple to do and I was able to view the program immediately. It's easy to get hooked on watching Homeland because there is a new turn in every episode -- and some red herrings, too.
B000SOYEQY|5.0|Beautiful cinematography, strong story(being a basically true story helps!). Vast vistas and deep insight into the cultures involved, especially if you know the backstories and what was going on!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|To be honest up front, I did not finish this book. I was expecting an inspirational book. I got about two-thirds through the book and I did not think it was all that inspirational. In fact, the middle half of the book moves so slowly, I found it difficult to continue reading. Once the book became somewhat gory, I had to put it down.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|It makes my kid think.  It teaches kids that there are different considerations that constantly need attention when caring for an animal.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I had and will have fun doing this again and again..It is worth the few dollars I paid for it for cheap entertainment.
B0050ZPAPA|4.0|I found Hounded very easy to read and quite enjoyable.  I normally avoid first person stories, so for me to have enjoyed this that's pretty good.  The main character is refreshing.  He's not your cliched brooding immortal, wishing he hadn't lived so long and bemoaning all the people he's lost.  He's cheerful, positive, and not above a bit of mischief.  I found this refreshing and looked forward to reading it.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Totally awesome book!!! Love all of Nicholas Sparks books.  Would recommend his books to anybody that loves to read books.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|No regrets when you purchase this DVD. Movie was great, one cant go wrong with the purchase. The DVD met family's expectations, minus the pop-corn.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|It was so confusing to me the way the series was half online and that certain episodes were blocked :/  So I went ahead and rented the movie.  I really love it.  Its a bit slow to start up but I think that makes you appreciate the characters more.  Once Master Chief showed up it was awesome.  Too bad it seems to end when all the good stuff is starting :(  Hope they make more of these!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Love eBay, easy to download, love the access to eBay on the go. AMAZING, met all my expectations. Thank you
B009FO96ZC|5.0|All I can say is that the musicianship from everyone involved is incredible. John McLaughlin continues to amaze me with his beautiful melodic lines.  His fluidity and precision is unmatched.  I don't think I can quite grasp what time signature some songs are in, but I certainly appreciate the catchy &#34;hooks&#34; that the songs have.  A few are reminiscent of the Mahavishnu days.  Gary Husband is completely unhuman.  I've enjoyed his drumming as well as his keyboard playing for many years now. Since purchasing it, I've listened to the entire cd approximately ten times and it has continued to grow on me.  If you are a fan of John or Gary Husband, you must buy this!!

B009YP9L7U|5.0|Really good book! Could not put it down once i started reading it. Definitely a good read! Everyone should read it.
1616614609|4.0|The game is fun once you get over the initial learning curve. Not for those who want to pick up a game the first time and play immediately. Nice to have a game designed for two players only.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Easy to load and maintain and operate. Various levels of difficulty to play well worth the price of nothing. great
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I like it. so much that I would never stop playing this game my little cousin told me to bring it to Christmas
B002VRZEYM|1.0|This movie stinks. A one-sided attempt which whitewashes an issue with erroneous semi-facts. People who think this is gospel are as smart as the hippies of the 70's and yuppies of the 90's. It just isn't as it's portrayed. Pure Methane based movie.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|After watching it on a stream, I got hooked, a great show, makes you think, makes you want more, what else should a great series need? one of my favorites.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Just what I needed to complete my collection. Not disappointed with this ending at all, I just wish it didn't have to end.

B0085P2Z6E|3.0|Same puzzles over and over. Hard to see small images. Cant scroll around without counting as taps. Storyline is tiresome.
B008JIWNYG|3.0|The history, drawings and characters in this book are fun and detailed, you won´t be disapointed by them. However, I downloaded this to my kindle reader and was disapointed that no smart panels are available so in each page you need to manually zoom in to read the text and then scroll down and to the right and once you are done reading you need to return to the default size before you can move to the next page... this gets tedious after the first dozen pages.<br />I really don´t understand why other books from DC (i.e. watchmen) have smart panels but this one doesn´t.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I love this cd and the music on it.  I love Halestorm anyway.  They aren't very known in a lot of places, but they should be.  Love their sound.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|&#34;The sky is always beautiful.Even when it's dark or rainy or cloudy,it's still beautiful to look at....it'll be there no matter what...and I know it'll always be beautiful.”<br /><br />This book is so tragically beautiful. I feel like I am doing Ms. Hoover and her book an injustice only rating it 5 stars. Because i truly believe it is worth so much more than that. Sky and Holder's story deserve more than that. So as a reviewer, all I am left with are my words to try and express to you why I believe this book is the best I have read this year.<br /><br />This book touches on so many sensitive topics. It is almost unbelievable how Colleen Hoover was able to do so without this turning into a horror story. But that is the magic of Ms. Hoover and her writing. She can take the most horrific of situations and turn into one that makes you believe in redemption. Her words give you hope to believe beauty can come from tragedy.<br /><br />Sky and Holder's story is not pretty. There is too much darkness in their lives for it to be. My heart broke for them over and over again. But the beauty in their tragic lives was each other. They were bound together even before they realized it. I want to write about the horrors they experienced and how it touched their lives. I need to talk about what i read to comprehend how there could be such evil in this world.<br /><br />But I can't.<br /><br />That would be ruining the story for you. But what I can say is, even though there are dark moments there are also beautiful moments.<br /><br />“The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss. Because if you've never felt anything when someone's kissed you, then no one's ever really kissed you. Not the way I plan on kissing you.”<br /><br />And those are the moments that make reading about all the bad worth it. You will need those happy times between Sky and Holder. You will need to hold on to them until the very end. Because just when you think thinks could not possibly get any worse, they do.<br /><br />This book is like no other. Even now as I sit here writing this review,I can not help but get teary eyed. Just thinking about all Sky and Holder experienced and still have to get through makes my heart hurt. And that is when you know you have read a truly amazing book. When you feel so deeply for the characters, it is as though they really exist.t any worse, they do.<br /><br />This book is like no other. Even now as I sit here writing this review,I can not help but get teary eyed. Just thinking about all Sky and Holder experienced and still have to get through makes my heart hurt.

B00881VLCE|4.0|I like this app! Very good graphics. Only critique would be that I would love if there were more pictures!
B0035V35P8|5.0|This movie is great for the simple fact that it is not like every other ninja movie out there.  There is a reason this character does what he does and why he goes against things rather than trying to get something back, like a sword or talisman.  Great movie.
B0076DELIG|4.0|The Harry Bosch series have always been entertainig, without the long winded dialog that takes away from the meat and potatos of the story.... The Black Box was no exception.
B001NIA27E|5.0|Love this movie, love the action and on the edge scenes.  Love Pierce Brosnan.  What more could you want or expect out of a volcano movie.
B009VB97EY|4.0|Okay, so I kept hearing this moving was awful over and over, but have to admit, when I saw the preview, my curiosity was sparked.  I love Matthew McConaughey (know I spelled that incorrectly) and wanted to see it because he typically keeps it light and funny and by far, as far as the acting in this movie goes, he does not disappoint, so no worries there. The man is funny and I can almost bet that his character in this movie is close to his real life personality. Oh Matt.<br /><br />But anyway, with the all the negative feedback, I decided to forgo seeing it at the theater.  TOO BAD I made such a tragic mistake!!! I've never been a fan of Channing Tatum, ever.  But wow.  WOW!!! I haven't stopped thinking about this movie since I saw it in November on DVD.  The dancing from Tatumn is INSANE!!!  I've been to one male revue in my entire life and found it disgusting.  I don't even know that I think Channing is that cute even still, but the dancing!  I could watch him dance forever.  I've watched Magic Mike five times now.  Obsessed much?  And now, I just fast forward to the dancing parts.  Sure, the story is weak, but not the most awful story line ever and can keep one's curiosity enough.  But, if nothing else, you'll want to watch and possibly own this movie just for seeing Channing Tatum move.  UNBELIEVABLE.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|5 stars, just a great all around family movie, will keep this to watch again.great robot action fight scenes. enjoy ...

145160713X|4.0|Lewis is great. Watch him on You Tube and get an idea of his teaching. The book is great! I highly recommend.
B0076DELIG|4.0|OK, I'm a big fan of Harry Bosch.  I've read every book with this character except the entire text of \\"The Black Box\\". I read the first 6 chapters of this book for free courtesy of the publisher (can you say \\"tease\\").  I'm going to buy this book.  The Harry Bosch series Rocks, and this book appears to be no exception.  Now, what format do I purchase?  I own a Kindle.  I love the Kindle.  I won't buy this book in Kindle format though because the publisher has seen fit to disable text to speech and lending.  I will buy the paperback when it comes out.  I may wait until I can buy a used paper back.  I may even buy it from a non \\"Amazon\\" sponsored book exchange web site.  If I wait, then I can at least lend the book to my son.  I can even lend it to every member of my book club.  If I buy the Kindle version though I can only lend it once.  It seems to me that the publisher and Amazon would be better off selling Kindle books.  Alas, I guess they know best.  As for me and my money I will buy books I can lend, and hopefully ones I can listen to via text to speech.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I'm a addict when it comes to serialized TV shows. However, no matter how much I love a show it is rare to find one that doesn't have a episode or even a season that feels more like filler. This is not the case with breaking bad, the show feels perfectly paced and intentional in every episode. The story never feels like it's wandering or stalling for time. The acting is superb and the plot line original and compelling.
B0000E6I1J|4.0|Concert for George was well done by all his friends through the years and all the recording they did together. Eric Clapton and Jeff Lynne are the best to cover George Harrison songs. I like when the songs are done note for note. You get to here all of George's great Guitar and slide style. George's song Horse to Water was done so well by Sam Brown, she did rock on that one but wasn't on the cd. Why, it would be good to have every song on the cd. George Harrison had so many great songs this is only a hand full. Billy Preston has played with George since The Beatles days on Get back and other songs, Clapton, Lynne, McCartney, Brown, Preston, Star, Petty and of course Dhani Harrison and the band did such at great job reliving George's songs again.
0762445262|4.0|smaller than you would guess it was, did not take up much room in a stocking.  but what do you expect for ten bucks?
B008YWY0HK|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  However, can we leave out the voodoo?  I don't think it is appropriate for little children.  It just creates a home schooling lesson during or after the movie.  I had to tell my son many things to keep him on track with good versus evil and how the choice for evil always brings disaster and ruin or suffering. Overall, I guess it is good to teach our children with an actual point of reference such as a movie.
B00AC8ZJ6K|4.0|Good movie. Had some very good action scenes. Movie has a very good story line behind it which allows you to get into the halo series.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|Laurine T. says:<br />I absolutely must chime in. The music in the movie: I love the music myself. It is upbeat and always manages to put a smile on my face. Given the plight of African Americans in this country, upbeat is good! The music does not rival the music in previous disney movies. However, I personally think that is acceptable. The music in previous Disney Movies was a classic and as time goes on many classic things are hard to reproduce. This may have something to do with the dumbing down of America. A NATION THAT FORGETS GOD SHALL PERISH. DEUTERONOMY 8:1-20. It is just like the classic TCM Turner movies. We will never see movies like Sidney Poitier did ever again. Sean P Diddy Combs and Phylicia Rashad did a remake of the movie, A Raisin in The Sun. It did not even come close to the original play or movie. It was 100% forgettable! On another note, Taye Diggs was compared to Sidney Poitier at the beginning of his career. I did not see the comparison at all. There will never be another Sidney Poitier. He walked into Hollywood and took it by storm. He proclaimed that he was not a black man. He was just a man! He knew something about his identity (who are you?) He refused to accept society's devaluation of him.<br />I think it is great to critique movies and all. However, I hope we can be very joyful and super glad this movie has been made. A milestone was reached in America and it is in the aftermath of a horrible slave trade that should have never happened in the history of mankind. Our African ancestors should have never had a price tag put on them and sold!!! This is preposterous and an abomination! If anyone has not studied up on the origin of mankind and how humans begin in Africa, please research this. You will find out why our hair is different from everyone else and our skin pigmentation. This information was life changing for me. Please read about the rivers mentioned in Genesis that are in Africa and come to your own conclusion about the first humans on earth and how they looked. (Jesus had hair of wool. All the photos I saw as a child portrayed him incorrectly.) During your reading please consider whether God just made humans or was God about making some people look better than others. You will be as astounded as I was to find out that God was all about geography and protection only when it came to skin pigmentation, hair type, and eye color. (All are Equal in the sight of God.) Man looks at the outside, God looks at the heart. Mankind starts out close to the equator and deep skin pigmentation and thick curly hair are needed to ensure the survival of mankind.<br />As always, Tiana was made the last Princess when she is suppose to be the first princess that ensures the survival of all mankind. Please do the research and reclaim your heritage that was stolen when our ancestors were taken against their will and enslaved. Please notice I said enslaved. They were not slaves. They were enslaved against their will.<br />In addition, the words black and white are used quite often in our society. I researched this and found out it is incorrect. These words create devaluation of God's creation and separate and divide. If you think about it, these words oppose one another. They are polar opposites and will always create separatism. I don't think either\\" people group\\" resembles the color black or white. These colors are in a crayola box and should have stayed there! Please research the word race and find out God did not create races. God created human kind only. It all began with Adam and eve. We (meaning all mankind) are the daughters of eve! Eve was the first woman on earth, the first wife, and the first mother. She is known as the \\"Mother of All the Living.\\"<br />Lastly, the movie was long overdue and Tiana is the first princess and not the last. The bible clearly states that the First shall be last and the Last shall be first. This has clearly played out in America with Disney princess movies. Therefore, I must withgreat intrepidation (A feeling of complete daring and utter adventurousness) move Tiana to the top of the Disney Princess List:<br />Tiana, from The Princess and The Frog (2009)<br />Snow White, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)<br />Cinderella, from Cinderella (1950)<br />Aurora, from Sleeping Beauty (1959)<br />Ariel, from The Little Mermaid (1989)<br />Belle, from Beauty and the Beast (1991)<br />Jasmine, from Aladdin (1992)<br />Pocahontas, from Pocahontas (1995)<br />Mulan, from Mulan (1998)<br />Rapunzel, from Tangled (2010)<br />Hats off to Anika Noni Rose who did a stellar job of portraying Tiana.<br />It would be remiss of me not to mention 'Sofia The First': Disney's First Latina Princess. Many were upset because she does not look Hispanic Enough. I am sorry that happened and many got to experience what my people have been experiencing in the U.S. for years. I viewed this princess and I agree, she does not look Hispanic at all. I must remind the Hispanic community that many things are hard fought to get. Hence, the civil rights movement, NAACP, and the segregation of Little Rock Central High School. It is interested to live in a society where people are trying to make everyone look just a like or similar. I do believe God got it right. There is no need for renovations.<br />Lastly, I am overjoyed that Tiana is deep brown sugar skin pigmentation. (I did not say dark skinned because this phase annoyed and lowered my self-esteem as a child. We need to burn it.) In a society that values the mundane, silly, irrelevant things such as a hue, It is refreshing to see the first African American princess have deep brown skin pigmentation rather than light brown.<br />There were some complaints about Tiana's prince being of another people group or not African American, but I personally loved this. It destroyed any hint of devaluation of Tiana and elevated her to a royal status of equality! She is good enough and she can marry anyone she falls in love with!The Prince saw Tiana's inner spirit and fell in love with her! Isn't that what love is all about? Blessings.
B001QFYCZM|2.0|My friend has a large framed poster of this movie. I saw Marlon and Vivien Leigh I automatically assumed it was a classic and bought the DVD. What an utter disappointment! I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but sadly that was not to be. Vivien acted as if she were on stage; While I enjoyed looking at Marlon Brando's good looks, his outbursts were too much for me. I won't be watching this again.
B000IZ0KRK|4.0|This is a pretty good movie about the historical time period after Henry VIII dies. Whether it's historically accurate or not is a whole different question.<br /><br />Henry VIII broke England away from the Catholic Church. He left 3 important children: Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth. Jane, whom this movie is concerned with, is 5th in line to the throne. Edward, as we know, was very sickly, and he is dying. The nobles are concerned that when he dies, if Mary, who is Catholic, succeeds, she will return England to Catholicism, and this is especially a concern to them because they have already plundered the properties of the Catholic Church and do not want to give it back. Edward, the child King, is under the influence of John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, his scheming trusted advisor. John Dudley marries his son to Jane, and persuades Edward on his deathbed to sign a document making Jane his successor. John Dudley has been prolonging Edward's life through arsenic, which keeps a person alive but in excruciating pain, just so he can have the time to persuade Edward to sign this document, poor kid. And so Jane becomes Queen of England for 9 days after Edward's death, until Mary manages to take over the throne.<br /><br />The love story between Jane and Guilford Dudley, John Dudley's son whom she is married to, is particulary touching. I'm told it's not historically accurate, but that's okay. At first it is a loveless marriage, but they learn to love each other, and he gives her a lot of support when she finds herself Queen of England. At first, Guilford has been living a dissolute life, and he is jaded because of all the unethical things he sees his father doing. But after Jane becomes Queen of England, he and Jane try to enact laws that make the common people's lives easier. I'm told this is not historically accurate either, and it did strike me as unrealistic and overly idealistic in the movie.<br /><br />It is so interesting and sad to see how these child monarchs arecaught up in the adult world of political intrigue, and how they deal with it. The first child monarch is, of course, Edward, and then it's Jane and Guilford, and you see how Jane and Guilford deal with these adults who are trying to manipulate them. I thought it was neat the way Jane and Guilford try to manipulate the adults, though I'm not sure that was historically accurate either. It was a bit sad, since Jane and Guilford keep saying, \\"Why can't we just go somewhere quiet and peaceful together and be happy and not deal with all this politics stuff.\\"<br /><br />Of course, Jane gets overthrown eventually, and she and Guilford are beheaded. It's a sad story.<br /><br />The movie was made in 1986, so maybe techinically it's not as great as we're used to, but it was okay. It stars Helena Bonham Carter when she was younger as Lady Jane, Cary Elwes (who was in The Princess Bride) as Guilford Dudley, and Patrick Stewart (from Star Trek) as Jane's father. Overall a good movie, though some people might find it dull and plodding.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Like all of the Harry Bosch series it is great from beginning to end.  Great plot and story line. Higley recommend it
B00AMBH70S|4.0|This is a solid two hour chase movie. Not as good as the three bourne series before but still very good.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|I spend a lot of time gaming and probably buy way too many peripherals ;) These are by far the worst headphones I've ever owned:<br />  * There is a constant hissing, which is common in low quality electronics (but Turtle Beach brands themselves as high quality)<br />  * The volume control 'box' on the headset broke in 2 ways: the clip broke after a few weeks of use, and the wires came loose, causing the sound to cut in and out.<br />  * The covering on the earphones bleeds when wet. Most people wouldn't care, but as a girl that washes my hair after working out, then sitting down to play games - this was a mess. No other headphone brands have done that.<br /><br />ABOUT THE WARRANTY!!!<br />I returned these under the warranty, which was also a serious pain (including the fact that they lost my headphones). They are supposed to have a 3 week turnaround, and it took 5 months! You're not allowed to follow up on your return until after 3 weeks... so I followed up after 3 weeks, SIX different times. First of all, they LOST the headphones I returned - so if you return them be SURE to get delivery confirmation so you can prove they were delivered. I got passed around to a couple other people who kept trying to give me a new RMA number. After getting them to understand, they said they'd send a new one out. Each time I followed up, after 3 weeks, on it's status, they would try to give me a new RMA number. After explaining the situation, they would tell me one would be on it's way. This continued for 3 months, until someone finally got one shipped.<br /><br />I got the new ones, and yep - there is still static. It's from the cheap quality of these headphones. Not only will I never buy these headphones again, I will never buy from Turtle Beach again either.<br /><br />I've always been happy with Plantronics headphones and would highly recommend them.<br />[[ASIN:B006ZS5ATM Plantronics GameCom 780 Surround Sound Stereo PC Gaming Headset]]<br />[[ASIN:B001SEQN3K Plantronics .Audio 655 USB Multimedia Headset]]io 655 USB Multimedia Headset]]
B002RI9UBS|5.0|Life of Pi is a beautifully written tale of an Indian boy, Pi, who narrates his story for the reader.  Pi lives in India, where his parents run a zoo, and part 1 of the book describes Pi's early childhood in India with humour and vivid description.  When Pi is about 16 years old his family sell the zoo and commence a sea journey to Canada to start a new life.  Some of the animals are to be sold in America, so travel on the ship also.  A storm sinks the ship and Pi begins an incredible voyage of survival against the odds, sharing his life boat with a bengal tiger.  At times very graphic and somewhat confronting, 'Life of Pi' is an amazing tale of courage and hope, simply and colourfully written.  This book is set to become a modern classic.
0316017930|5.0|Given it many times as a gift.  Always well received! I have all of Malcolm's books and this is my favorite.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|As with the 50 shades trilogy, I found that these books were overhyped and grossly underwhelming after I read them. To say they were NYT bestseller's is horribly overrated but as a whole they were decent reads. Maybe they should be considered as a top choice for a younger audience and not a 31 year old. But I needed to see the reason for the movies coming out.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|5+++ stars and I wish I could give Hopeless a 10! This book is a beautifully written story about survival. You are hooked by Sky and Holder in the first chapter and you just can't get enough of them. This story is so not predictable and just when you think you know what will happen next to Sky, Colleen Hoover throws a twist into the story!  I now have a new book boyfriend , Holder! He is truly amazing. Thank you for another fabulous story Colleen.

B007CGLRWA|5.0|They seemed to have fit just about everything that's wrong with the world today in to this movie! Can't you see it's not just about teachers or the school system, the real problem is that everyone pops a few kids out and then doesn't give half a crap what ever happens to them after that! It's a wonder anyone turns out ok in this world where no one is ever parented, guided or cared about. You breeders pop 'em out but you don't do anything to guide them. We've got a society full of wild animals left to fend for themselves. This is why people are as horrible as they are. It starts with parenting the kids you have, and everyone else caring about everyone else if we're to have any hope of living in a decent world again.

B009AMANBA|5.0|\\"Lincoln\\" is a film underscoring some of the poignant and glorious events of President Lincoln's legacy.  Obviously, this film interested me because I frequently heard about the significance of Lincoln's legacy all throughout my middle school and high school years. Additionally, I had the chance to previously garner more information about Lincoln from the following circumstances: a Gettysburg Museum visit while I was still in the military, fascinating details included about him from the book \\"One Nation Under Sex\\" (by  David Eisenbach PhD and Larry Flynt), and further  details from both a paper that I wrote and a class that I took less than 11 months ago. Daniel Day Lewis naturally channels the legacy of Lincoln in a dignified manner.  It is hard for me to choose from the best in this film because many of the actors and actresses poured their souls into their acting parts. However, I would have to admit that I also liked Tommy Lee Jones (Men In Black films) commanding portrayal of Thaddeus Stevens and James Spader's (Stargate,The Office) amusing depiction of William Bilbo.  Lee carefully plays a character who is ahead of their time with the projected emotional strength in standing for equality. Meanwhile, Spader plays both a serious and comical projection of someone who was part of the foundation implementing Lincoln's  plans. \\"Lincoln\\" is a good movie for those who see the good in Lincoln's legacy and/or those who are open to viewing American History films.

0316172324|5.0|This book is AMAZING; right along with all of Malcolm Gladwell's other books! In fact, this book inspired me to look more deeply into a couple of the studies Gladwell reveals. He combines information in a way that opens your eyes to the world around you, along with a possible revelation of yourself. This is a must read book! I have recommended Malcolm Gladwell to everyone I know, and then some!

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read this book because it spent so much time on the best-seller list. The book reminded me of the Twilight series in that it was written with high school/college age readers. I would not recommend this book for ages 45 and up.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Let's be real - it is a useful tool for keeping in touch with distant friends & family for those of us that don't feel the need to put up for review everything we do and think all day.  Beyond that, it is a slow, buggy program that wants to sell you things, collect your personal information for somewhat nefarious ends, judge your uploads and censor those they disagree with and generally make money off the fact our society has become more insular by giving people a way to feel connected with humanity even if it is shallow and facile.
B00493E1GI|4.0|I watched this before reading the book, which was a blessing. Having recently finished the book, I found it more in-depth than the movie. That said, I liked this movie a lot. Julia Roberts was (as always) beautiful and believable. The sentiments of the film stayed pretty true to the book, to wit, love yourself and find peace within you wherever you may be. I would watch this movie again and I would recommend it to other people.
B007L6VR12|5.0|MOONRISE KINGDOM addresses a problem that is prevalent at present in that we seem to be less educated about relationships, despite endless eBooks and blogs and regular books, and lectures/seminars from teams of goodwill popular gurus that can be hired for a price. Wes Anderson takes a different view by placing relationships under a microscope, using children to act out the fragilities and joys and consequence of allowing someone else into our heartspace. The result is a charming story about first love and coming of age that is respected by not only the writer/director Anderson, and the musical director Alexandre Desplat, but by a cast of both seasoned veteran actors as well as refreshing newcomers. It just works.<br /><br />Set on an island off the coast of New England in the 1960s, as a young boy Sam (Jared Gilman) and girl Suzy (Kara Hayward) fall in love they are moved to run away together into the wilderness. Their moments together reveal a growing love and as they carefully step into the territory of first love relationships they gradually become physical:  conversations occur - `Sam: It's possible I may wet the bed by the way. Later, I mean. Suzy: Okay. Sam: I wish I didn't have to mention it but just in case. I don't want to make you be offended. Suzy: Of course, I won't.' and when hugging each other and having their first kiss the very simple words are so memorably sensitive `Suzy: It feels hard. Sam: Do you mind? Suzy: I like it.'  A storm brews and the `adults' begin a frantic search for the youngsters - Suzy's parents (Frances McDormand and Bill Murray) who state ``Our daughter's been abducted by one of these beige lunatics!', the scout master (Edward Norton), the Social Services person (Tilda Swinton) and the local sheriff Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis).  And it is this hunt that the meanings of the film fall into place.<br /><br />When the youngsters are found, the conversations rings like `Sam: I admit we knew we'd get in trouble. That part's true. We knew people would be worried, and we still ran away, anyway. But something also happened, which we didn't do on purpose. When we first met each other, something happened to us. Captain Sharp: That's very eloquent. I can't argue against anything you're saying. But then again, I don't have to, 'cause you're 12 years old. Look, let's face it, you're probably a much more intelligent person than I am. In fact, I guarantee it. But even smart kids stick they're finger in electrical sockets sometimes. It takes time to figure things out. It's been proven by history. All mankind makes mistakes. It's our job to try to protect you from making the dangerous ones, if we can.' There is so much that can be said about this dear film, but nothing equals experiencing it.  Grady Harp, December 12ew people would be worried, and we still ran away, anyway. But something also happened, which we didn't do on purpose. When we first met each other, something happened to us. Captain Sharp: That's very eloquent. I can't argue against anything you're saying.

B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Got this one as a gift and she gets a new detail every time she sees this movie. It's like an easter egg hunt for her. She'll stop the vid and look at ALL the details. The director has an &#34;everything counts&#34; view on details. Many details the viewer won't have any references for or how they pertain to the characters or environment. I like that about this movie as well. I get that feeling that we as an audience are in &#34;sorta&#34; familiar but definately Alien (pun intended) territory. It's a great movie, and I do consider it a prequel to the Alien series.
B009E3EY38|4.0|I love Led Zep having listened to them since i was a teenager back in the 60's. There has been little video footage of them that was any good.  This Blu-Ray is the best you will get.  That said, it does not compare with the concert films of say The Band or The Stones, Shine a Light effort both of which were done by Martin Scorcese. My biggest criticism is that the shots are all over the place. They never settle down and focus on the band playing which i think is necessary to make you feel like you are really at the concert.  The edits use some grain inducing special effects in some places.  Please.  Do not tamper with what is going on there.  The focus should be on the concert and the music.  My hope here is that they will reissue this with a straight ahead film that shows you something more like the audience experienced.  The sound is good, but could use some more work also.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|then you will want to add this to your collection!  Great holiday CD with some amazing tunes!!  It currently lives in my car so I can listen to it all the time.

B006M7JCC2|5.0|Excellent book. Liked the first section when she narrates her experience. Post event explanation is okay. I will recommend this book to all
B005RAO0GS|4.0|I really like Florence's voice. The album is great from one song to the next. It's one of those albums that you listen to over and over and find something that you like about it again and again.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Book started off rather slow-moving, but after a couple of chapters it became a breathtaking race to the finish.  Any fan of mysteries or Connelly will love it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was one of the best I have read.  Keeps you on the edge of your chair throughout.  Would highly recommend reading this one.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game. Its fun, easy and has all the ponies. And you have achievements! I highly recomend it and rate it 5 stars.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I came in the mail so fast. It looks just it does on the website warped up nicely and everything.
B0037VNX44|1.0|This movie is below average. It shows scenes of male nudity, extreme violence and transvestite-like characters. The only thing that the plot builds upon is that there is one guy called bronson, and he is very violent. Thats pretty much it!!!
B000PY6BBI|4.0|My wife and I watched this and it brought back some fond memories and it was great to see Matthew Broderick, Rutger Hauer and the absolutely luminous Michelle Pfeiffer again as they were in their youth.<br /><br />Rousing adventure, a bit of magic, a great villian, lots of manly derring do and a spot on sense of humor thanks to Matthew Broderick who is a great stand in for the audience.<br /><br />Only criticism is the music which dates the film and makes it of its time (the 80's.) My wife and I wondered how a redux of the soundtrack with all the wonderful Celtic music of the past 30 years might up-date the film.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|This game kept me engaged.  The story line was fun and the puzzles were all different.  I am looking for more.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Well written with good plots and characters that work well with each other . I would ( and have ) recommend this to my friends
B0085YNML2|5.0|Just as good as every one of their products.  Fun and enticing.  Good physics and great artwork.  I like how they continuously invent new ways to play every stage.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book is a great book ii would recommend it to any one who likes to sit on the end of their seat this would be a great book
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|This franchise needs to die.  The earlier movies with Robin with Chris ODonnel were much better.  It keeps getting darker and darker - too violent for the kids.  Whatever happened to comics for the kids?  Now that they are cashing in on the comics for adults as movies, forget the kids.
B009O07NDY|5.0|I have heard and bought many film scores in my lifetime, and this is easily the most beautiful score I have ever heard. Howard Shore is an academy award winner, and he definitely lives up to that potential. This score is amazing, plus the extended edition includes some beautiful bonus tracks. I attended the midnight premiere of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, and the film was amazing, but honestly, I didn't know which to focus on, the film or the soundtrack. Howard Shore doesn't disappoint in this soundtrack, and i would definitely recommend purchasing this soundtrack to any and all music lovers.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Believe or not it's not as cerebral as the Arnold Schwatzenegger version!  Of course the book is best.<br />Plenty of action but very short on revealing what is going on.  It distracts you because the writing sucks!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Predictable, sure, but thoroughly enjoyable. Great cast, a feel-good movie. Anything with Amy Adams and/or Clint Eastwood is sure to be worth your while viewing.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I am a DeMille fan and have been for years.  In my opinion, this is the worst book he has authored.  I am still looking forward to his next effort.
B009DCOU9S|2.0|A lot of talking unoriginal puzzles. Boring graphics. Not what I hoped for.  Repetitious searches. The story is just silly. Sorry I bought it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't usually write reviews for the books that I read but this one deserves all 5 stars and a review!  I absolutely loved it, it was fast paced, kept you on your toes because just when you thought you had it figured out something else would change and came full circle with an ending that did not leave me wondering.  I honestly have to say this is my favorite book ever!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Nice little time-waster.  It's not something I find myself playing constantly, but it's easy enough when I've got a few minutes of free time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I've enjoyed playing this game. It's a lot of fun! And it strenthens your ability to plan ahead too! Fun!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It is a fun game, pretty standard but I wish you could change to different tiles.  A variety of up to four would be ideal.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|It OK.  A historical event, from a different perspective.  Acting was good.  The plot based off real events during the prohibition period.  If you like HBO Boardwalk Empire, then this is a flip side to the glitz & glamour.
B000MV8ABS|5.0|Seen this movie years ago, just as good again now.  Going to order the rest of the series, seen them all years ago, and loved them all.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I thought it was what it was supposed to be.... a fun, light read.... if you want heavy, go read Voltaire.....
B001VLXNLU|3.0|Yep, really wanted to love this. My daughter loves the series and suggested I try it because I tend to like YA fantasy genre. She related a lot of the story to me and it sounded like something i would like. However I just couldn't get past the author's writing. Perhaps it matures up after a few installments but I couldn't get past the all the side remarks the author has the main character make. They are distracting and unnecessary. Also, PARENTS BE AWARE that there is some serious sexual action and innuendo going on - in the very beginning of the book - one of the students is seen having oral sex with another in the hallway. When I questioned my own daughter about it she said she didn't realize it but I would caution parents with younger children reading this series that some innocence may be being lost through the pages....  I will say I will give the series another installment to catch my attention but at this point it doesn't, even though it does have a rather large YA fan base.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|What a good book! You kind of know who committed the murder but then you begin to doubt it. The ending is shocking!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I can't wait to see this on the big screen, although in reading it I think a TV series would be more entertaining as there is a LOT going on. But the way networks are, they'd probably kill it before giving it a chance! The book does not really make it clear that the &#34;Shadowhunters&#34; are angels but they are &#34;Nephilim&#34; so it's pretty obvious. The author takes you straight away into the story and builds the characters along the way so there's no long &#34;preamble&#34; to wade through before getting down to business, The characters are believable and you immediately start picking your favorites. Then &#34;Downworlders&#34; were obviously well researched and their &#34;lore&#34; or &#34;backstories&#34; are treated with respect. The Seelie courts of the fey, the vampires, werewolves and every other fantastical creature is included which makes it really interesting to see all of these in one story. It's a basic good vs evil story but with twists and turns all along the way. I am alreayd deep into book two, just waiting to see if the relationship that is whispered about all along the way happens or not -- and it woldn't be so bad to see the bad guy go down too!! Thanks Cassandra for a great adventure!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Buying this book was easy using Amazon. It was sent directly to the kindle app on my ipad :) Easy to find and convient to buy books online!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Not much to say. The most masterful, compelling story I have ever seen.<br /><br />Be warned, it will ruin TV for you. You will compare every show you view to this, and think &#34;It's OK, but it's not as good as BrBa&#34;.<br /><br />Seriously, my wife and I watch Homeland, Dexter, The Walking Dead, The Wire, The Sopranos, Boardwalk, and most other critically acclaimed shows. While many are great, BrBa is simply incomparable.<br /><br />Incredible writing. Sorry to see it go after Season 5 returns, but it was the correct decision.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|The movie was interesting with a good story line.  It had a little mystery that kept you in tuned with the movie.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|This is a very complex movie.  The subject matter or concept of the movie however is excellent.  You've got to stay with it and sometimes a review of material is required.
B008JH5CVS|3.0|This movie had some good action scenes. It provided some good drama.  It is good win the bad guys loose to the good guy.
0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief is an amazing story about a young girl growing up in Nazi Germany, and the power of words. Nine year old Liesal Meminger begins her life on Himmel Street as a foster child. On the way her brother dies suddenly and she is left with unfamiliar people. As she grows and learns to read she discovers the influence of words and the desire to cherish them. Soon she resorts to thievery. On top of being a criminal, her foster father is hiding a jew in thier basement. Things become difficult as air raids begin nearing Munich, and the book thief must come to terms with the tie between words and war. The Book Thief is a heavy and inspirational book that brought me to tears. This is one of the best experiences a reader can have: realizing just how important words are, right along side of Liesal.
B006MOW98E|5.0|This book is too cute for words, that's all I can say. I just have too many warm fuzziness and squishies going on to explain how much of a must read this book is. Great for the holidays!
B007SGLZP8|1.0|This book was great , I could not put it down. I read it in one day. It was thr old John Grisham
B004SUDPXW|5.0|I don't need to tell you how good Breaking Bad is. Breaking Bad's third season, on Blu-ray, offers amazingly beautiful image quality. It was perfectly mastered. The special features are numerous and very informative.
B003M8NG94|3.0|None at all. Just the movie and the language options. The movie is also in widescreen despite it being a blu-ray disc. It should take the whole screen so it can take advantage of the resolution.
B001DJLCPE|5.0|Blu-ray really brought Dr. Strangelove to life. The mastering was fantastic.<br /><br />I was surprised to discover that the bombardier was played by James Earl Jones. I had never noticed that before.
0345529057|5.0|I like the paperback books with the HBO characters on the box. The only thing is you have to be careful if you bend the book back while reading it the binding will wear down. The books are a good read and as always way more detailed than the HBO series. I love them both.
B000N6UERK|5.0|This is not a serious movie but it is fun as hell and very, very beautifully made. It looks fantastic on Blu-ray.
0316067598|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  Marcus Luttrell and his fellow Navy Seals tell an amazing story or courage and sacrific in the war on terror.  I am grateful for men of their caliber, true Americans willing to stand up and go where most would not.  This a story everyone interested in duty, country and honor should read.  It was inspiring!
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I think this on the greatest christmas movies of all time a must have. If you haven't seen this movie then you should check it out you'll enjoy it and for those of you who has seen this movie go ahead and treat your self to it.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|muy buen producto ademas de llegar bn empacado la pelicula es GENIAL los 4 discos super con los contenidos extras
B00701L5XS|5.0|I use it occasionally when I need to tie something off with something other than my 'normal' knots.  The animated demo is helpful, but the explanation of when and why you'd use a particularly not, and alternatives which may be more appropriate is the best part of the app.
B005CFWNPI|4.0|Very comfortable and exactly what I expected.  Good quality, color matched same as shown.  Would definitely recommend to croc lovers.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Once I got passed the first couple of chapters it took off and got a lot better. I will miss Mr. and Mrs Grey. Although the characters are very similar to Twighlight.
0062073192|5.0|Don't get this unless you want to be struck down with the sheer pain that is the Winchester family. I cried.<br />A lot.<br />I'm still crying.
B007MDB548|4.0|I got it for my Granddaughter and I have not seen the movie myself. But she seem to love it.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I would have been mad if I paid $14.99 to watch this or had kids!  I love Mark Wahlberg, but this film was really bad.  DO NOT WATCH WITH KIDS!  Boys ages 17 - 25 might find the drugs, non-stop swearing, fighting, and sexual innuendos funny, but even my husband said he wouldn't have rented it if they had shown just one of the scenes in the preview. Essentially, the main character has a conflict with growing up and choosing between his best friend, a pot-smoking, womanizing teddy bear, and advancing the relationship with his girlfriend.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|This is one of my best memorys. I love it and hope my Granddaughter loves it as will thanks again
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Another show where good is pitted against evil.  In this case the big corporation heads who have only personal agendas with no compassion for their underlings.  Main character well cast and sexy to a fault without being super good looking.  Different from anything else on the tube.  Highly recommended.
1401222668|5.0|This is a fantastic work of graphic fiction. From the layout to the colors to the dialogue to the pacing and everything else - it is all extremely well crafted. This is a work that stands as a masterpiece of graphic-fiction, and that cannot be duplicated in another medium. You wouldn't watch a movie about good wine if you wanted to know what good wine tasted like. Watchmen is best appreciated as a graphic fiction. It achieved things in the graphic medium that were innovative and difficult, and it pushed the boundaries of what sort of story could be told. There is a lot going on in this book that was lost in the film, but, more importantly, there are many things to appreciate about Watchmen that are impossible to reproduce in any other format.<br /><br />Buy it, read it, enjoy it as it was meant to be experienced. Alan Moore will love you for it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just discovered this a few weeks ago and blasted through the first 2 seasons in the same way i do reading a really good book.

B007MDB6L0|5.0|SO CUTE !!!!!!!!!!!!  Way worth buying to watch over and over.  My daughter and I both loved this and will buy it for my niece too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is sprinkled with just the right of magic to keep you sooo addicted you never want to put it down. I went to be dreaming about Hunger Games Series and I woke up thinking about them. I couldn't think about anything else.
0756405890|5.0|I can't encompass why this is so amazing.  It just is.  The writing style.  The appropriate level of comfortable cheesiness mixed with nice twists.  The comedy offsetting the tragedy.  The writing style.  It's important enough to say it more than once.  This is the first thing Patrick Rothfuss ever published.  I hope he keeps writing until he dies.  I want him to hurry so I can read more... but I want him to take his time so that it stays good.  I should be upset really.  He ruined books for me.  Since I read NoTW a year or 2 ago I haven't bothered to read anything else (besides the sequel).  Nothing else is good enough to feel worth it anymore.  I E-mailed him and told him so.  He responds to every message he gets, which is incredible.  (Or still did when I E-mailed)  He was appropriately modest and recommended some of his favorite books/authors.  Anyway.  Buy it.  Read it.  If you can't read it, get the book on tape.  If you don't like it I'd be shocked.
B003WH765U|5.0|wonderful movie, great actors, great story a true classic. puts todays movies to shame, no twlight junk here. watch it!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you're buying this, you are probably already aware that this less than 1 season show has a cult following.<br />It's exactly the type of sci-fi I enjoy.  The type Robert Heinlein might write about.  It's a space cowboy thing.  There is space travel and advanced technologies, mostly, but many planets can't afford that stuff and live bare-bones in an old-west style way.<br />I love all of these main actors, most of which I first saw in this show.  Enough that anything else any of them stars in, I find worth a watch.  The acting styles compliment each other with amazing chemistry.<br />  I would recommend this to anyone really.  I think anyone could enjoy it.  But any low-level nerd will probably LOVE it.  I do.<br />When you finish it, and are disappointed by the lack of closure because the show was cancelled... Check out the movie made to appease us cult people.  &#34;Serenity&#34;.  There are also comics written you can look for to learn more about other characters, like the background of Shepherd Book.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|I bought this movie for my great grand daughter and we are having the time of our life watching it!!!
1423124960|2.0|Ordered this for my little girl for christmas - beautiful hardback book with nice silvered pages and gorgeous illustrations as well as cute bedtime stories. I have to admit that i did read the not so great reviews on quality (as in the book falling apart when opened) - and ultimately decided to order anyway as the reviews i had seen were a few months old and i had thought maybe it was just a flawed batch that was produced... Maybe so, maybe not but my review would have to match. Upon receiving this book and opening the front cover i heard a crack as the binding split, along with several of the pages from the binding. Too late to replace before xmas, so i will be doing my best to repair it myself - but very disappoined, if not suprised.
B00005AXKF|1.0|I did not get to play the movie due to the fact it came in the wrong langage...I speak english and it's something I do not understand!!!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I loved this book although was troubled and frustrated at times with the involved explanation of events, i.e. waterloo and intellectual discussion regarding words. But overll highly recommended.
B009VB97EY|5.0|I heard this movie wasn't good except for the dancing but I totally disagree.  I thought the story was real and well acted.  And I absolutely love Channing Tatum.
B00123IB32|5.0|All of the songs are good. Seriously, why are you still reading this? Get the album. Get it now! Shane McGowan is a genius.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|I know it doesn't seem possible, but this movie was a bore.  Poor J. Depp, way over the top as usual but this time it didn't work.
B00009AOBI|5.0|THIS WAS A GOOD DEAL SEALED AS STATED & A VERY GOOD MOVIE AND A DIRECTORS CUT ALSO, THANK YOU.
B008CP93S0|4.0|This was a pretty funny movie but I'm glad it only cost us less than $5 to watch it and not closer to $20 cuz it wasn't that funny!
B0002X314C|5.0|This product came way before sheduled time.  I got it used but you would never know that it was used.  It looked as if it were new.  There were no cracks on the case nor scratches on the C.D.  It was all handled very professionally, and the C.D. plays well.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I absolutely loved this book so I was really excited to see this movie.  I wish it had stuck closer to the book and I'm not sure about the ninja like quality of the fight scenes but it was still pretty awesome due to the concept of the story alone.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Having read all Michael Connelly books I was so excited about this one. Unfortunately, this is not his best work. I love Harry Bosch, but, he is not the character I have grown to love, in this outing. Still a great read, just not anywhere as great as his others.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Recently saw the stage version and it was soooooo much better.  Some of the changes made in the Movie made sense but most of the changes to the characters themselves were stuuuuupid!  Bummer too because the music is so much fun.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|i love this movies is the boom and i love it nice on blue ray and 3d and i got it for cheap for 20 dollars and it was worth it every penny
B00785P2QC|4.0|love the app... only complaint besides them wanting real money is that you cant tell how much it costs to build your new goals. For instance, it says I can build a theater but when I go to build it I don't have enough city credits, however it doesn't list how many are required.
B007JWKLP6|5.0|I love George so this is not a hard sell for me.  You buy this book for the quality and photographs.  If you are looking for written incite into his life...I would choose another book but for the photos...LOVE IT.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This book gave an excellent perspective of why we have obesity in our world with heavy research to back up the findings. It makes a lot of sense and doesn't have easy answers but gives the reader another level of world understanding of why there is such weight problems in not only our country but in 3rd world countries as well.Recommend it to broaden one's understanding of our weight issues.
0793518326|5.0|Great book for musicians and fans a like.  word by word, note by note.  Composers would also enjoy this book as part of their collection.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Best game I have ever played. Finding differences, and matching. There are also some puzles where you have to arrange picture. I would recommend it.
B00846REIS|5.0|By far the best erotic love stories I have ever read! I suggest this book to anybody who enjoys a beautiful love story. I loved every part of it
B00AHSKRJ4|1.0|Don't know what all the fuss was about ...this was the most boring, and painful movie to watch in recent memory.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day did it again in this book. Very enrapturing and enticing. such a beautiful love story. Awesome series!!! Cant wait for the last book.
1596680199|5.0|I really appreciate all of the info and details about making beads and using the tools and findings.  So informative and I've had a ball creating many of the designs in the book.  Very useful for the beginner who wants to make polymer clay beads for a hobby or make gifts.  I absolutely love this book and I've checked many out of the library and none compare with this book.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Good detecting by Harry Bosch as usual.  I was going one way when the book went another. Enjoyed it very much.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|It is the free version so ads are expected. But the video ads popping up in the middle of the game is too much. this use to be one of my favorite games but now I can't play. I am deleting it since I cant even play anymore.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|I love McEwan's work so I keep reading, waiting for it to really happen. I'm 80% through however and it's just not coming to life for me. I'm going back to LeCarre.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|I bought this and come to find out that unlike Itunes, ultra violet has a limited time to get the digital copy. I just purchased the dvd and find out the download was expired. There should be some reduction in the price if the digital copy is no longer available. Bring back itunes! I am totally miffed at this! Should not advertise digital download if it is not available.
B0076DELIG|5.0|As usual I enjoyed the Harry Bosch novels by Michael Connelly I think I have read all of them and will read any more new ones.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This has become my favorite game.  Like playing better on my computer than on my Amazon Fire.  Only problem is that you can chat while playing the game.  There are quite a few people who pop up in this chats who are just there to stir things up by calling people names and using inappropriate language.  If your child is playing this game you may what to check on whats being said in the chat room. You can block the person by clicking on their name...you can also report them this way.
B007V65R54|1.0|So this slacker who plays with spreadsheets of baseball stats while he should be appreciative of his high-paying \\"boring\\" job tries to make a living off his hobby.  If you've seen Moneyball, he didn't have anything to do with it, but he mentions it so many times you'll think it was about him... And when that doesn't work out, he quits his job for what is clearly an addiction to video poker (just the kind of guy you want your daughter to bring home). And somehow this makes him a statistician?  I had hoped this book would be helpful, but it's basically this guy's mediocre exploits (that's not my judgement - he admits he wasn't a very good poker player) and name-dropping. I finished it thinking, here's a guy, who when he couldn't do anything else, he wrote a book... and I bought it!!  Ugh!  He's $12 richer and I'm none the wiser. Save yourself, there are tons of better books on megatrends, statistics, and/or prediction. I bought it on a trip and so didn't do my usual research.
B003LWVDQE|5.0|I had read about this legendary recording for years. Often, these things don't live up to the hype. Not the case here. I've always loved Jim Hall's playing. The Rollins originals are my favorites.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|just what we readers hoped to get out of another Lee Child book about Jack Reacher.  A great read that flies by so fast you wish it were longer.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|Absolutely in my top 5 favorite movies from my childhood! Also bought a copy for my brother to share with his family.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This game is highly addictive! It is a combination of hidden objects to piecing puzzles together. I would recommend this game for everyone.
B00957T6X6|4.0|I'm 46% through the bundle.  Like the young people, and the Imp a lot.  Rather bored by Daenerys, in spite of the dragons.  Don't care for the gratuitous sex, rapes, etc.  Very interesting how the bad folk are changing and becoming much better folk. Always be prepared to lose major characters abruptly.  Had read the First Book about 20 years ago, but find it more interesting this time, having seen the TV and putting faces to many.  Way too many lesser Lords and Bannermen so far.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|the gane us one of the brst i have pkayed and eith the extra ganes the pack is totaly worth it
0525953728|3.0|To be a Seal, requires real tunnel vision.  The raid itself is interesting, given our wish to get Osama.  Life as a Seal Team 6 member has been written before.  I admire his sacrifices.
B003WUYRGI|2.0|This book is boring but good for info. I wish it had better ways of explaining though it would help slot :)
B005EY2XFC|5.0|One of my favorite movies is and will always be the crow starring brandon lee. A film with equal parts sadness and hope, dark and light, death and life. A film with the ultimate anti-hero and despicable bad guys. Based off a comic i have never read. It is a movie on the surface about the vengeance of our anti-hero who returns from the dead to avenge his murder and the rape and murder of his beautiful fiance. Who  he can only be reunited with after all the wrongs are set right all the while being the led by a crow. While that is at the heart of the movie there is so much more to it. At the very beginning when the narration starts i knew i was in for a memorable and emotional journey. Brandon lee gives a fantastic performance as a soul driven by equal parts anger and everlasting love for the his fiance that was so tragically torn from him. A movie with out a doubt that is dark and violent. But also full of beautiful themes if you look beyond the surface. And many memorable lines which many have already quoted. And excellent cinematography,performances and a fitting soundtrack. And i want to say i have not see many movies where the violence directed toward the bad guys was so deserved. On one final note of my favorite lines is delivered at the end of the movie toward the gang leader before he is killed.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Best holiday film to come along in a very long time.  Will Ferrell is a genius.  I don't buy movies unless I really love them.  I love Elf!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|my kids and my wife love this game and both kids and adults are equally entertained by it. so glad I got it on a whim.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Loved reading about the Avengers as a kid, and particularly took a likng to the Green Arrow character that was portrayed there. That being said, the attempt at the TV series for the (now slightly renamed character of) Arrow I originally thought seemed to lack originality, or believability. But this isn'tthe Green Arrow comic book character of my childhood. Instead, it's a revapmed version, with a revised storyline to freshen up the character and keep him up to date. I have to admit, while I originally thought that it was going to get dull and boring, and going to be the same old, same old, show after show. I have to admit, that after having watched only a few shows, I find myself wishing that I had purchased the TV pass all along. Oh well, to late now. I guess that I'll just have to continue purchasing...and enjoying whatever's going to come up next. If you enjoy action, adventure, & intrigue...I'm sure that you'll enjoy taking this opportunity to step away from your own personal reality to enjoy this one. I can honestly say, if you enjoy the newer version of Batman, then you will more than likely enjoy Arrow. To me,  Arrow does not disappoint.
1451638450|5.0|This was one of the best books by Lois McMaster Bujold!  I have already read it several times and plan on reading it again!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|excellent read, awesome writer, wonderful and believable characters! pick up and enjoy:) Fast read, all three books read on our Holiday in Cancun...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am yet again blown away a third time by one of Colleen Hoover's books. Read this book in only a couple hours. Literally could not put it down. It is an incredibly beautiful story filled with ups, downs, laughs, cries and everything in between.  I have noticed with each over Colleen's books you get drawn into each character and really feel for them. Great work yet again Colleen!  Hoping for possibly a sequel to such a well written and emotional story.
B000T433CO|4.0|The first time I saw this movie, I thought ho hum.  However, it has been on tv a lot and I have now seen it several times.  The thing I don't like about it is how people will jump into bed with anybody they don't really know.  However, after I get past the ridiculous idea that a couple that is having sex would do so while the woman is wearing a bra, in an obviously unrushed situation - the only reason a woman might keep on a bra while having sex - I mean, come on, sex is one of the most intimate things a person can do with another person - so why would one hold back on intimacy by wearing a bra other than --- it's a movie.  So the entire &#34;jump into the sack&#34; idea is negated by the bra.  So, now that I have told you why I find the movie ridiculous, the reason I like the movie is that it kind of grows on you after you see it a few times.  Jude Law is very engaging.  Cameron Diaz is still cute and perky.  So besides the ridiculous writers, directors, and producers, deciding it needed a sex scene to sell it - it's a cute movie, a chick flick, etc.I think the characters whose intimacy is based on uncommitted sex could have stood on personal chemistry alone - but I guess they don't make movies that way.
B005P5TQPU|5.0|I really enjoy the series. Not much else to say, but I have a minimum amount of words to use.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This is a delightfully poignant and quirky little story about a talented young race car driver, Denny, whose wife dies of cancer, and who gives up everything to try to retain custody of his daughter. The protagonists are the rich and self-centered maternal grandparents who never liked Denny and thought their daughter should not have married a race driver who made his day-to-day living as a mechanic. They went to great lengths to get custody of the little daughter, even to the extent of bringing trumped up charges of perversion. The quirky part is that the whole story in narrated by Denny's dog, Enzo (named after a race driver), who has become educated in man's ways by watching TV, is a race driver too at heart, and has developed an extensive race driver philosophy by listening to his master and watching videos of his races. If that is not enough fantasy, Enzo is also into Hindu teachings, believes in reincarnation, and wants to come back after he dies as a man. I am neither a car racing fan nor a dog owner, but I loved this little tale, just for its pathos and human values, and for showing that karma justice works and right does triumph in the end. And even though not a dog lover, had to shed a tear when Enzo did finally pass away. The ending, however, was happy - the karma thing worked, and maybe so did the reincarnation.
B0044KI79S|5.0|I have been a fan of this series for awhile. It's fun to watch them travel in a cool car and kick ass.
B004SIP8OI|5.0|One of Tarantino's best, some argue it is his best. I was hoping and waiting for a deluxe or anniversary edition with lots of extras but that hasnt happened yet and Amazon was selling the blu ray for $3 so I felt the time was right to pick it up.
0316044695|5.0|I read this book with my heart pounding. To read a first hand account of four brave Navy Seals, and what transpired on a barren mountain thousands of miles from me in New York, was inspiring. I have worked as a firefighter for 26 years and have faced my share of challenges, but nothing even remotely close to what they endured. The book moved me. God Bless all our Military Personnel, especially the Navy Seals.
B004SIP8SY|5.0|One of Tarantino's best, some argue it is his best. I was hoping and waiting for a deluxe or anniversary edition with lots of extras but that hasnt happened yet and Amazon was selling the blu ray for $3 so I felt the time was right to pick it up.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|If you like the Jason Bourne movies, you won't be disappointed. I plan on adding it to my video library.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Pitch Perfect is a silly/cute comedy, with subtle romantic scenes. It's refreshing to watch a successful comedy with women leading roles.<br /><br />It's PG-13 so there are a just a few inappropriate jokes but they are done so in a sneaky innocent way. And it's nice this is set in college, not in high school.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Rebel Wilson (Fat Amy), so that's why I was most excited to watch this movie. However, it would have been better if the majority of her best lines weren't in the previews. Surprisingly, there are a couple other girls in the group that make up for it like Hana Mae Lee (Lilly). Her character is awkwardly weird, but mostly original. You have to pay attention to her quiet remarks. They are disturbing but funny. Almost reminds me of \\"Marcel The Shell\\" on Youtube. Apparently she's a comedian in real life. Her bangs are flawless.<br /><br />It would have been nice to see a more in-depth plot for certain scenes that weren't explained as well. However, this was meant to be a comedy, so I suppose a meaningful plot wasn't as important. Elizabeth Banks character Gail was used great as a random person because most of her lines are said seriously but it's so ridiculous that you can't help but chuckle uncomfortably.<br /><br />Loved Brittany Snow as a red head. She should never go back blonde.<br /><br />This movie is a little girly obviously because the lead roles are women. But it's not enough to restrict one audience group. Moreover, I will probably watch this again with my boyfriend.<br /><br />Worth a watch, especially with a group of friends. Great music remixes!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. Suzanne Collins has a vivid imagination. Even though the story is rather depressing, she defines the scenes and characters so well. You have to read book 3 as well to get some relief.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm a fan.  I'm generally not an arcade player these days but this is an excellent way to burn off some nervous energy.  Very well implemented, light-hearted fun.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|I love it. Felt like I was reading a junior fiction book but I love the Halo series and it Mr. Eric did a great job of fleshing out an epilogue for Master Chief
B000T433CO|4.0|Before watching this movie I was not a big fan of Jude Law, Jack Black and Cameron Diaz. Diaz was okay in this story; not too annoying. I've been a fan of Kate Winslet ever since Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind and her character in this story is simply too cute. Jude Law's character is a man whom doesn't date much and the viewer can not but hope for his success w love. Jack Black is a music fan and that continues to be evident admist his character's struggle w romance. Black is toned down quite a bit for a much more approachable role. A very enjoyable comedy that my wife and I have enjoyed every year since it came out!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This album is incredible, the songs are some of the most catchiest I've ever heard, personally my 3rd fav by them and Im even reading the novel based off of it.
1451695195|5.0|I BOUGHT THIS BOOK AFTER MY DAD PASSED AWAY.  THIS BOOK WAS SUCH A GREAT SOURCE OF INFORMATION AND HEALING FOR ME.  I AM ALREADY A BELIEVER AND AM THANKFUL FOR MY SALVATION....THIS BOOK JUST GAVE ME MORE PEACE ABOUT DAD BEING IN HEAVEN AND KNOWING HE IS HAVING THE TIME OF HIS LIFE WITH JESUS-THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE!
B003O86FMW|5.0|All the previous victors begin sent back into the arena was a surprising twist but what happens next is shocking. Excellent read for all.
1423140591|5.0|I have read the Percy Jackson series since second grade and I love Riordan's work! He does a fantastic job of blending detail and character development. I would definately recommend this to anyone of of all ages and cant wait to read The Mark of Athena!!
B001N8V7KA|5.0|I love all of Clint Eastwoods movies. But I I think Firefox is one of his best.<br />An American pilot goes to Russia to steal a jet, how cool is that.<br />Watch Eastwood weave and dodge through the whole movie both on the ground and in the air. Writing this review makes me want to go back and watch it again. A real 5 in my book.<br />If you like Clint Eastwood you have got to see this movie.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Fast-paced action.  All the Tom Clancy heroes/characters performed as expected.  Looking forward to future stories that include Adam Yao, Melanie Kraft, and Gavin Biery.
B000IXUOP0|5.0|I rated this program a 5 because I think its a great show, episode after episode. I never tire of watching NCIS.<br />The writing is supurb. It is as good in the 10th season as in the 1st.<br />The characters have some of the most ideal personas for this show. I love Abby who is a gothic scientist that can determine the story of any piece of evidence no matter how small or seemingly insignificate.<br />McGee can hack a computer system better than anyone including the FBI CIA and others.<br />I recomment this program to anyone that enjoys crime dramas.
B00A0R0CG0|4.0|Funny. A great addition to the Ice Age franchise. If you like the others, this one is right in line.
B002ZBZNPO|5.0|very excellent cd they just keep pumping out great tunes I sure hope this band is around for a very long time well that's my review hope you finance helpful.
0525952926|5.0|Anxiously awaited the arrival of this book.  Fast service.  Love this series.  Only regret it ends!  Anticipating #3 with great expectation.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Entertaining and good family values, aside from the three little rascals.  ;)  Scottish story, done by Scots.<br />Excellent graphics, fluid motion, not comic book style, one still frame, or scene at a time.
B006VREHRS|5.0|Great service.  Love this show.  Started watching late in the season so this caught me up and gave me background.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I love these movies.  This is a GREAT value for all the movies with so many bonuses on Blu-Ray.  Wow.
B0053O89JM|5.0|I have bought my son every season of this series and I am sad to see it go. I looked for it at many places and your site had the best price and delivered it very quickly. It was also packaged very well so it didn't get damaged.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|Waste of reading time, finally just flipped to the last chapter to get it  over.  Not worth saving , will delete.
B009S33I68|5.0|MUCH BETTER THAN THE MOVIE, THOUGH IT WAS VERY TELLING.<br />Written by a real soldier and shows what war, at least in Vietnam, is like.
B003Y7PM5E|5.0|Into the wild is one of the best movies I ever seen and the soundtrack is not for the movie, but for all moments of our life's. Vedder's has a magical voice and his talent have been an inspiration me through all my life.<br />I think that is one of the most important albuns in my personal collection, at least, it's one of the most inspire me.<br /><br />Great work for Sean Penn to, for the excelent movie.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Another very touching tear-jerker by Nicholas Sparks.  A wonderful story and once you start reading it, it's hard to put down.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This is a classic, one that in a simple and iconic way defines the true spirit and meaning of Christmas!
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Lots and lots of action, very funny in parts very entertaining to watch will buy the video so I can watch again.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|I wasn't as impressed as the amount of marketing that went in to hyping the movie ...<br />a couple of scenes had a feeling of 'newness' to them, of course computer generated...<br />very violent movie out of hollywood, again.<br />I would watch again, with one eye on a chore or something...
B00899E5B4|5.0|&#34;Analog Man&#34; is great...Filled with finely crafted tunes and inspired playing. Joe Walsh sounds invigorated!!! Great to have new music from this american musical treasure.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|It was an interesting twist on life and how sometimes it is more about surviving than winning.  I will probably read the next book.
B00978V35C|5.0|Robert Cray's &#34;Nothing But Love&#34; is definitely one of the best collections in his fine catalog. Mr. Cray has made a career of delivering consistently polished, yet inspired R&B and blues records. He is a true master of American soul music. &#34;Nothing But Love&#34; is wall-to-wall deep grooves, stingin' riffs and sweet soul singing. He makes it all seem so easy...
0385535147|5.0|John Grisham has such talent--keeps you hooked right to the very end--and<br />the ending is always unexpected.  The Racketeer ranks right up at the top of<br />the list

B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is awesome. You get over 100 games. that's why they call it 100-in-1 games. I get it, you might be saying &quot;no duhhhh &quot; right now but I really don't care. This game is cool, even though its not all that. but its great.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|very good and informative all you can ask about the weather around your city and the country perfect for any device.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Have seen it before, very good movie, fun to watch, and on my list for Christmas movies.<br />I recommend it, to children of all ages.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I will never rent an unrated movie from Amazon again to watch with my teenage daughter.  The language in this movie was completely inappropritate for a teenage girl.  Even I at age found the language offensive.  We stopped watching the movie one third into it and have no intention of ever finishing it.  One would think that a teddy bear themed movie would be appropriate for children.  Fool me once, shame on you!  Fool me twice, shame on me!<br />Roy in Denver
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Very hot indeed . I love the way the book has twist to keep you wandering . I'm from Barbados and it thrills me to see Barbados in books

B007FG9LIE|5.0|One of the best books I've read this year.  If you are looking for a suspenseful tale, look no further.  I don't want to say anything about the book, because honestly, that would ruin it.  It's a quick read and a great page turner.  I was worried about the ending.  I have read many suspense books that just have the weakest endings.  This one however, was excellent.  I really enjoyed the ending and didn't see it coming.  Really great book!
0060179872|5.0|I have read most of the MM biographies & this one tied up all the loose ends.<br />I knew what he said was the truth, in my heart.<br />The book isn't exploitative & I found that refreshing.<br />Such a sad thing when someone who really was such a larger than life personality<br />just trusted the wrong two people.<br />It did not need to happen, that's for sure.If you read one book on her life, read this one.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I could not put this book down. The characters jumped off the pages, the events of the century came to life. My only problem is I have to wait a year for the final book of the trilogy.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|I decided to watch this movie since my son helped do the special effects makeup for it.  I actually liked it.
B005V5WBFG|1.0|get to try this one before giving up. This program wants you to give an email address AND password. WHAT! It doesn't want you to create a password but use an existing one. If you have read my other reviews on security programs then you know I wasn't having that and already having hacker trouble. Are you kidding me? BUT, if you're strapped AND HAVE NO ENEMIES, you have no worries. That is if you don't want to give your email AND password. Then again, if you want to use this program just create an account to use with it. I hope you can feel secure. I didn't.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Loved the first season and like this one even more....this season is more serious and feels like it could really happen which adds the sinister feeling. If you like to be scared, this is the show for you- better than any movie you could rent too!
B00A2XU9IS|4.0|It's cute for younger kids. They can countdown each day and have a little game to look forward to. Works well.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Definitely a plot for&#34; cyper &#34;lovers. Exciting page turner. Makes one think of what might really be out there. Another exciting Clancy novel. Good twists to the story keeps you on your toes. Thoroughly enjoyed this book.
0385523912|5.0|All I can say is, wow. The stories of these poor North Koreans during the famine are so profound, detailed, and touching. I highly recommend reading this as it is an excellent book.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This sharpner is a great little tool to keep around everywhere, especially for the price.  We keep on in the kitchen at home, I keep on in my backpack, tackle box, and Jeep.  It is quick and effective, easy to use, and very light weight.  We purchased several of these to give away to everyone as gifts.  Great little product, keep up the good work and innovation.
B00005QVVB|5.0|This was great, It was good to find something that I watched years ago that still interested me and was available in good condition
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|Simply one of the best things I've seen on TV, ever.  It's practically a crime they cancelled it.  Whedon is a talented guy, but this is his best work in my opinion.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|this is such an awesome show.<br />i look forward to watching it every week.<br /> i cannot wait for the next seasons.
B00A9C3RNQ|4.0|My sister and I both throughly enjoyed this movie.  It made us laugh as well really give thought to our own lifes as we age and how easy it is to get set into a routine.  It is nice to see a movie that deals with middle agers who struggle.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|this is so much fun to watch.<br />lucy liu is the best.<br />and tommy lee is tremendous .<br />brings the real sherlock to life.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|Not worth the money.  Simply not as good as the previous episodes.  Truly a waste of money.  Needs to be reevaluated.
B002ND6AOM|5.0|I was a huge Duran fan back in the day.  This is one of the best albums, album covers, and videos of the 80's.  Haven't listened to the whole album in years.  It is great as ever.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|wow! not sure how i managed my free time before i found flow free. this is a very fun game...just be careful...time gets away from you when you are playing it!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This author has a different writing style which takes a few pages to get used to.  He writes the story in first person, and mostly uses short sentences.  Not even sentences.  Just thoughts.  I am enjoying the story, but it is taking a while to get to know the main character.  I guess it reads like people think--in bursts rather than sentences.  I will probably buy more Lee Child and look forward to fgetting more familiar with Jack Reacher in future books--not from the movie-!
034580404X|5.0|these books were in brand new condition when i received them, no damage during shipping, i haven't read them yet, so i can't say if the story line is good or not, but i heard it was great that's why i bought the set.
B009ZUZ9FW|4.0|Nothing but praise for this book, for the most part.  I can certainly see why it's the 'go to' book for C programming.  While it does assume some semi-unrealistic levels of knowledge in some places (bitwise operations, for example), it is for the most part very plainly written and, provided you concentrate hard enough, understandable.  I found a few minor typos in the Kindle version, but other than that I have no real major complaints.  All of the examples provided are compact and concise, and each serves to demonstrate an important aspect of the programming language.  The one main drawback is that you can speed through a large amount of content very quickly and wind up overwhelming yourself if you don't stop and take breaks from reading to apply and reinforce what you've just covered by actually attempting to write programs.  For ambitious readers, however, this is basically the perfect book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I waited to see this movie until i read the book and i am so glad i did! Cannot wait to read book two!
1419364375|5.0|I saw the movie and loved it but the book was more detailed. Its a great tale that I'm sure is someones life
1400049628|4.0|Can't make any review of this since it is a gift and I did not read it<br /><br />I hate the fact that this makes me write more than what is necessary
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|This didn't seem to flow like previous Clancy books did.  It wasn't a bad read but it wasn't Hunt For Red October either.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I loved SMASH on NBC last spring, and I was so happy to see it available at the bargain price of $14.99 on Instant Video.  The digital format is high quality video as well as audio, and allows you to cue up to any number if you don't want to watch the whole episode. Very nice escapist fun to relax to after work.  Enjoy!
B008742O32|5.0|I couldn't get along without this app.  Makes it so much easier to get into your Android device and add, change or fix things. I use it on two smartphones, and two tablets.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|Fantastic Mr. Fox is a great movie. It is funny and has a good story. Lots of good stars are in it.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|Fogerty and CCR - what else needs to be said! I'm listening to them right now! They're great!  And, at a really great price.
B000V63BN6|5.0|Many great songs I was not familiar with along with the Stevie Wonder songs I knew and loved. You should own this.
0345803485|1.0|Six or eight months ago I ordered 50 Shades of Grey for my Kindle but could only get through the first two chapters.  It's like a tweener with poor literary skills wrote it, not a professional author.  Two weeks ago I noticed the cd's at the library for the audio book and thought I'd give it a try again.  Couldn't do it -- five discs into the set I gave up.  Boring, monotonous, incessant iterations of \\"Oh my.\\"  It's an irritating and immature story.  I simply can't understand the world's fascination when there's erotica out there that outshines this by a long shot, if that's what you're looking for.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved it! Great story and presentation as always from a Grisham book. Would recommend it to everyone. Story line and presentation superb
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was an great book! Once I started reading I couldn't put it down. l think it gives a great account of heaven from a medical perspective. I am an RN and I like the medical aspects he wrote about in the book.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|The information included in this wonderful book gives you full insight as to how one of our greatest Presidents thought.  Our current President is much like Lincoln...a wonderful read!  I fully recommend it to anyone interested in Lincoln history.  He is worth the time spent.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I thought the book was well written and very funny. An overall joyful read through and through. Can't wait to read the second.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|One of the best biographys I have ever read! Goes to the depth of his history and being and nothing is off limits.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone that likes a fast moving action packed show, I gave it 5 stars and loved this
B002VISNLC|5.0|i didnt choose this book,my 5year old granddaughter did,she started school in june and is already at an 8year olds reading level so this is a perfect book for her level.<br />we snuggle up and both have turns reading, love it its hard to turn off at night.
B002I9Z8B2|3.0|The quality of the picture and sound was good. I would not say that it was the highest quality that I've come to expect from a Blu-Ray disc, but it was an upgrade from the DVD version. It's not much more expensive than the DVD, so I'd say it's probably worth the upgrade.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|We'd all like to get apps that have great graphics and enough medium challenges to keep us occupied for many hours, but the majority fall far short. If you keep in mind who this one is made for, you can appreciate the simplicity of it. My grandson is 3-1/2 and loves it. It's one app he doesn't grow tired of.<br />With a little guidance, they learn to be methodical about taking the patient to their room, cleaning up the floors of trash, and then finding out what's wrong with the animal patient. They then have a short treatment procedure which leads to the patient happily leaving the hospital.<br />I'd recommend it for almost all kids in the 3-4 range. After you run through it with them a time or two, they'll keep going back to it. It gives them a sense of accomplishment and pride in that they help sick animals.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|I bought this show because I really enjoyed Band of Brothers. I found that this show didn't have quite the same character development as Band of Brothers, but it was very good! The sound and picture quality is great, even on the DVD's. I have really enjoyed it!
030758836X|4.0|Good book, easy to read.  Good plot twists, and intelligent writing.  One of the better books I've read this year.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I liked but I wish there were villagers and wolves and eggs for zombies and creepers and the other creatures but is better than block story
B001JNND9W|5.0|The best car movie !!!<br />Dodge Challenger é uma verdadeira obra de arte para quem gosta de carro. V8-Hemi, as cenas de perseguição são perfeitas.<br />Eu considero o melhor de todos. Gosto tanto que comprei um Challenger, só que 1973.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|After watching the first season, I figured it would remain just a miniseries of pre-wwI aristocracy and the gears that keep it running beneath the surface. There was no way the family could keep going as they were. That's the mastery behind the show, they weren't able to. Suddenly, the show has become a deeper look at the politics and divide between turn of the century social classes. Love it!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Leave the gun, take the cannoli. Não tem sequência melhor no cinema do que o Poderoso Chefão. Programa ótimo para um dia de chuva. Ver os 3 filmes seguidos.
B009GX69RK|5.0|One of the funniest shows I've seen in a long time! I love every episode! Season 2 even tops season 1.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|After years of procrastinating, I finally purchased a dedicated film media scanner, the DB-Tech FS150. With thousands of old 35mm slides yet to scan, I was eager to get started. I was impressed with its compact size and ease of operation. I did have 2-3 calls back and forth with Sam in Customer Service. Sam is a gem and though seniors can sometimes be slow learners with newer technology, Sam was very patient with me answering every question or concern I have had. Sam explained that there were some different procedures for Mac than for PCs. Sam admitted right up front that he was not as knowledgeable about Mac compared to PCs. But, he was also quick to brush up on those Mac procedures and shortly had me scanning and editing slides like a pro. Compared to the other sources and methods I've used or consulted with this DB-Tech scanner is by far the simplest to use and produces excellent results. So far...this unit is a hit! Slide scanning is available locally at 99¢ per. I figure that once I get through the first 79 slides, this unit will have paid for itself pretty quickly.<br /><br />BC
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I knew it'd be a good book, having followed Tim's scrolls since The 4-Hour Workweek. What I didn't know is just how much info was actually packed into this sucker! The book looks almost 150% bigger than the hardcover of 4-Hour Body, with tons of pictures and nicely laid out instructions. I ordered two more as gifts the second I opened mine and saw I'd immediately like it.<br /><br />My ONE and only nitpick is his cutting/dicing instructions don't match up to their written descriptions, so it's sometimes hard to follow the basic instructions on cutting onions, for example. Photos line up A, B, C, D, but the writing follows 1, 2, 3, 4, and they don't necessarily match up all the time.<br /><br />Loved the book, thanks again Tim! :D
B009E3EWPI|5.0|My friend loved this!! Of course I couldn't wait until Christmas so he got it early!! Perfect present for the Led Heads out there!!
B004I744AS|5.0|I got this app because I am going back to school.  I'm in the medical field and this is truely the best!!  I can see why it's a 5 star!!  You can't go wrong with this.  I would have paid money for it and still loved it!
B000J1AGQI|5.0|My son teaches high school students-social studies & world civ and when this movie made it to his Christmas list, I knew it would be a perfect stocking stuffer!!
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Movie reminds me of the movie Heat.  Lots of good acting.  Benicio DelTorro is flawless... almost like he is this character.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Great story Lovely backgrounds. I really enjoyed this movie. It is a chick flick but my hubby enjoyed it as well. All of the charecters have depth and aging is portrayed well. I would give this movie an extra star if I could it is that good.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.  I think Jeremy Renner is a nice transition from Matt Damon.  He will carry on the legacy well.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Glad they changed up the story it would have been boring if an exact copy of the original. That said I never thought I would say this but there was almost too much action. It was like a jump from one action scene to another.It was a good movie but sooo much action hard to follow the story. If you blinked it jumped to another chase or fight scene and you could easily get lost as to why.
1451695195|4.0|Such a good book that I have shared it with friends, who shared it with other friends, and on and on!
B000M5NRLC|5.0|This is such a good movie. Ron Howard did a top notch job on this movie. They could not have been easy shoes to fill. We all grew up with the grinch and the orignal Dr. Suess book. Talk about preconceived notions. But this movie tells the basic story with a few side turns along the way which is good in this case to change up the story and give it a bit of depth.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|Good movie...could have been a little more clear in the plot. Jeremy Renner is a good actor in this movie.
0761163808|5.0|This is such a perfect product to use in introducing people to the beauty and grace of the animals one minght enconter on a Safari. This new photo process is pure fun and beauty.  The story boards hwich go with each animal are illuminating and engaging.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This movie has become a part of our Christmas! The season just doesn't get underway without Clark and cuz Eddie!
0743270754|5.0|This is a remarkable book. I am a Lincoln afficianado - a daughter of Illinois -who has always been<br />proud of the &#34;railsplitter&#34; and his contribution to the life of our country. Kerns-Goodwin has done an incredible job of laying out politics in an arresting fashion;  especially in our current times. The paperback edtion makes for much easier reading. I like the &#34;feel&#34; of a real book but the hardcover would have been too cumbersome for my arthritic hands.
B00023B1AS|5.0|I'm amazed at how much power these two guys can produce out of just a pair of guitars, and it's not noise power, it's rockin, dancehall, don't mess with Texas kind of power. The videos are excitingly illustrated with leggy 80s' girls and classic cars that make your heart race, and add joy to any party. This collection is timeless and time-honored. Get off your Tush and get out La Grange because you don't want to miss the show.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry Bosch continues to be a great character. Good mystery book by Michael Connelly. Page turner and easy read. Loved it.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Have enjoyed this movie since I was a little girl. The movie is very down to earth. I belive it tells of the struggle we all have when confronted with decisions of survivile.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Like all soft pornography Fifty Shades titillates briefly and then quickly becomes boring.  It is difficult to imagine what all the fuss was about when this book first was published.  It is poorly written, repetitive, plot-less in the sense that every event is foreshadowed and predictable. None of the characters, especially the two principals, remotely resembles an actual human being.  They all are caricatures, or perhaps more accurately, cartoon characters.  This atrocity should have been reduced to four pages and submitted online to Literotica.  Fortunately this first book of the trilogy is so bad I am saved the couple of hours I might have spent reading the following two.  My 11 year old granddaughter is a much more accomplished writer than is E. L. James.
B00589BMF0|5.0|Nothing more need be added.  If you haven't seen it yet, crawl out from under your rock and rent this.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Speechless! I love this author, she has again left me speechless. Best book I've read all year and this is remarkable as I read at least 5 books a week. Don't hesitate download this book now. I would buy it again even if I had to pay $9.99.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|This is a fantastic read for anyone interested in self-education. The title is actually misleading as this book is more about learning how to learn through the skill cooking rather than just being a cookbook. Worth the $10 for the Kindle download.
0316098515|5.0|My favourtie cookbook ever. The only book what I read once every week. Fantastic ideas, accurate recipes, great flavors, amazing photos. This book is required for everyone who lives in a country which is a bit behind of any culinary developments, like Hungary. Useful from A to Z.
B0053JJLLC|3.0|this was not a disappointment, but it wasn't Crichton's best work either (the other writer may have had something to do with this
B009NQKXYK|4.0|This prequel to the Aliens Trilogy is amazing, emphasis on the first two vowels in the word amazing, and the story line/screenplay very &#34;adult.&#34; It did seem at times that the visual impact of the scenes didn't match what was actually happening on the screen but you thought, &#34;but wow how awesome is this.&#34; Not quite a complete meal so I was wanting more meat on the bones in regards to story, ancient civilization, technology. I wanted to be overwhelmed by the &#34;anthropology&#34; of the myth behind Aliens. I don't know if it was the director that made this production a bit too &#34;mature&#34; for my liking. I've had better exposition during a twenty minute Marvel animated feature regarding the other worldly dynamics of an alien culture and the reason behind the conflict. It's a Blu-ray keeper for the visuals alone but the story won't pass muster beyond the first viewing.
B000F2C87Q|5.0|Cannot get enough of the entire album.  I repeat and repeat, over and over.  The sexy guitar, the saucy drums, that voice....just.  LOVE.  it.
B0045XICB2|4.0|Surprised that it was very entertaining, not as crazed as everyone else but I fully enjoyed the storyline. It is at least worth the hype to view it/rent it, you can't go wrong if you like vampire lore.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Once you start reading, you will not be able to put the book down, trust me.  Great entertainment.  I do recommend it.
B0052BZ6X8|3.0|I enjoy Micheal Bay Productions they are futuristic and visually impactful but this, seemed to have a great premise even if it was for only one movie but it appeared to be second rate given the super quality of Micheal Bay's work. The performances were good but overall it seemed to lack a true commitment from the screenwriter. The whole alien nation with a few survivors being deployed to earth was a great plot but nothing more came of it. The back story needed to be integrated throughout the movie so we as viewers become invested in the reason for the conflict in the first place.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|It puts all the movies in the correct perspective as the spirit and humor Dickens wrote it is not always portrayed correctly.  It was as a pleasurable read as it was eye opening.
B0077ZNCE2|4.0|I love vampire lore, so I broke down amongst all the media hype surrounding the final show down that was being shown in the theatres. I fully enjoyed it as I had expected but I wasn't exactly floored by it. But it is a good show of decent screenplay, good acting and good special effects. If you're looking for something hardcore in the action genre you might feel cheated but overall it was a good show for a rental fee.
B00AE2J5HI|2.0|I lost interest really quickly, I think LaBeouf was a poor choice for the part (southerner).  I would have left in the theater.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I give this app 5 stars when I use it on the original Kindle Fire, but for some reason on the new Kindle Fire HD, the shared calendars aren't appearing. When I go to Settings > Visibility/Download I should see a list of all my calendars, including shared ones, but now they're not there. I hope this changes soon! I absolutely LOVE this app on my Kindle and use a shared calendar at work every day to book appointments. Please update!!<br /><br />Update: I originally rated this 3 stars, before I fully understood how to work the settings.<br /><br />The shared calendar feature is actually already available for Kindle Fire HD. If you're having trouble accessing your shared calendars, make sure that your Google account is correctly added in your settings (Settings > Accounts > Add account). Once I added my Google account this way, my shared calendars finally appeared under Settings > Visibility/Download. I' m not sure why they weren't visible to begin with, but they're here now.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This book depicts the life of a young orphaned girl in Nazi Germany during World War II; from the perspective of the Grim Reaper... not in a creepy way... just very unique.  While the theme of the book is sad, it does have its uplifting moments and aptly portrays the goodness that exists between the cracks of evil.  The book is a quick, easy read.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I felt it was written &#34;simply&#34; and could have used a little more depth and complexity.<br />I still enjoyed the book and am glad I read it.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I really liked this app. I found it very easy to use. Simplicity is key and I think this app is all that. What was so nice was that I could see all the items I wanted to compare in one place and I was able to do it quickly. Picture quality was exceptional too. I would recommend this app to anyone, even the people in my life who are technically challenged. I havent used this app for long but I know I will use it a lot in the future.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book grabbed me the minute I started it. I loved the characters and I loved the premise. Some disturbing notions but I couldn't stop reading
B009RH973I|5.0|I love it! I am so excited to own this case. It is sturdy and keeps my Kindle secure and safe. The elastic band is like a safety belt that keeps my kindle in its place and the cover where it should be. The cover also acts as a sturdy stand when I'm tired of holding the Kindle, not that it happens often mind you. Excellent product.
B00486070K|5.0|Apple left the wired ethernet ports out of their latest computers.  Sometimes I still need to connect the old fashioned way.<br />Genuine Apple.  Good quality and fast shipping
B005P4P966|5.0|Love this show. Can't get enough of it. I've seen every episode of every season at least 4 times now - it never gets old!!
B008ALAHA4|4.0|This adapter works as expected.  Expensive for what it is, but cheaper than buying a new power supply.<br />Genuine Apple quality.  Recommended
B002P73UQW|5.0|Love this show. Can't get enough of it. I've seen every episode of every season at least 4 times now - it never gets old!!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Why does it seem to take so long for the good novels to reach us.  Over six months for &#34;The Black Box,&#34; and probably another for the next.  This novel is one of Michael Connelly's best.  I've said that about everyone of the Bosch series, and so do many others.  My only way of surviving another six months before a new Bosch arrives, I'll spend rereading some of my favorites.  There are a lot of good novels out there, good authors, too, but only one Harry Bosch.
B005SAJRV0|5.0|Love this show. Can't get enough of it. I've seen every episode of every season at least 4 times now - it never gets old!!
B0042VJ1PI|3.0|A fluffy, fun novel which has some of the same wit from the hit TV show.  &#34;Castle&#34; fans will love it!
