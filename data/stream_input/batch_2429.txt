0446547646|5.0|A page turner from the very first page.  Great Book,  This is a book that I will read again, and again, and again
B007L5GDGW|2.0|i love the concept of this game.  Sadly, the controls are too unforgiving and demanding.  It's not irredeemable, but it's underwhelming.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Her story is unique and fascinating.  Shows how a person life can change when one realizes the truth of who we really are. Thanks Anita.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Love love the swiping feature.  As long as you have wifi this app works wonderful.  Spoiled me after using an older iphone. Thanks!
B0039YZPZ4|4.0|I don't consider this movie a keeper, but it's a very good Sherlock Holmes flick.  Robert Downey Jr. makes a great Holmes, but the stop action analyzation of what he's going to do is distracting.
B009IEXKXI|3.0|Interesting but somewhat predictable, the major plot is good but one gets the feeling that it's just a matter of time!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Love how it makes you think, and how one event leads to another, and everything is connected somehow. Plus the accents are cool
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great fun kids love it can't wait for the next city bonuses are great needs a slow button for some parts
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I bought this case for my phone last year and it lasted a long time and did a great job protecting y iPhone 4. I am very rough with my phone so every time I drop it, I always check for any breaks in the seal. This case lasted through quite a few falls, a six year old, a five year old and a two year old playing with it and still kept water out.<br /><br />My phone just recently fell out of my truck and cracked the aux. protective screw so I am ordering a new one. A whole year of underwater adventures and really tough love makes me believe that this case is definitely worth the buy. I am ordering a new one tonight based on my own personal experience and success with this product!
B0000C0FJB|4.0|Rush was my first concert.  Every time I seem them live, I am blown away by how good they are.  Every one of their albums is disappointment, since the magic of Rush live on stage can not be recorded.<br /><br />I read a review about this album, and how it captured the feel of Rush live.  I guess whoever wrote that review has a better stereo than I do.  This was another recorded Rush show.  It's great because it reminds you of what they can be when you see them live, but it did not capture them live.  If you already have several live Rush albums, there is no need to add this one to your collection.  It has a lot of great music, but very little of it was actually new to my collection.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Really awesome mouse, great for MMO, love the fact that it has multiple profiles so I can switch between them easily during game play.
0452295548|5.0|lovely read for anyone interested in the complex working of the brain and what we now know and what we still don't know:-)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love the clothes, the protocol of old England, and the stories. I can't wait until season 4,  jolly good show.
B005VKMB42|5.0|i LOVED THE WHOLE ALBUM, CANT WAIT TO HEAR WHAT SHE HAS NEXT. iT WAS fAST SHIPPING, i AM STILL LISTING TO IT OVER AND OVER
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|U got carnivores, herbivores, and attractions. There r decorations that boost  cash flow. It has all of the characters that made the movie what it was and is.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|The book covered an area that I was not that knowledgeable about and I found it very educational.  I had some knowledge of Lindbergh's actions but this book expanded it, especially about his activities after the war.  I also never realized how timid Roosevelt was before the war or that actions like Lend Lease were not as effective as I thought they had been.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|My grand daughter loves this , She will holler nana  come play with me .She will say let's play Draw Something and of course I always give in what else can I do. I do what nana's are s suppose  to do I .draw until  she's tired I'm not<br />sure what one is her favorite game but, I'm sure it's this one.
B00AB0Z88S|3.0|3d - was well done.<br /><br />Story = boring, I've seen this already via Tom Hanks in Castaway.  Its a rental.  Don't waste your time buying this.  You'll watch it once and throw it aside.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Fun to play.  But don't like to have to wait until a few hours before I can play it again.  (you get 8 times to play) then you have to buy more times to play.  So I wait unil the times up and then I can play for 8 more games.
B009MYARIK|4.0|While this wasn't one of Kinsella's better books (let's face it, it's kind of hard to outdo the 'Shopaholic Series'), this was a great read.<br /><br />I enjoyed it!
B007V5CF5K|1.0|Thought it was a glitch but played again to the same point. Item you need to carry on in the game is under the kindle menu button and cannot be accessed. Amazon needs to check these things are compatible before allowing them to be put on general release- I would like my money back. Feel let down<br />NB: Only gave it one star because I couldn't give less. Game is fine but because it has not been checked thoroughly for kindle compatibility , it does not work and therefore we have been sold a dud that does not work
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|I was so disappointed in this movie.  I liked the actors and the idea of the story but the writing just didn't deliver.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing bingo  it is addicting . I will play any bingo as long as somebody doesn't bother me. I would  from morning till  night time ,I've been told to lay off the bingo for a while so I have.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|A good read although a little unsatisfying as I was hoping for more positive resolutions to some of the outstanding issues in the series.  Of course, that is about me not the books.  It does keep me coming back for more. I'm sure that is part of the plan.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie is hilarious if you enjoy raunchy, &#34;I can't believe they just said that&#34; comedy. We couldn't find it at the local department store so we bought here. A great guys movie.
B00BZODDYU|2.0|I love GDT, but this movie blows.  It pretty quickly descends into cliché and then gets bad - laughably terrible.  I can't imagine any executives thinking this was passable.  Maybe they needed a bad film for some reason.  If that's the case, then they succeeded.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great story, excellent videography, drama, action, thought-provoking, loved it!! Watched it twice and then read the book.  Highly recommended except for young children.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|As many people have said, this does not seem to work on the Kindle Fire. I loaded it and it worked for the first few times but now it looks like it is loading and then takes me back to my home state. It was a fun game in the limited amount of time I was able to use it! Hopefully they will fix on subsequent releases.
B001QJUX24|5.0|This definitely goes down as the best John Wayne movie of all times (along with &#34;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&#34;). John Wayne's in his true character and certainly acts at his very best.<br />Highly recommend it!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is the second time reading this book. I recommended for my book club after the first time. It is a simple story that captures some wonderful spiritual themes with lightness and humor. Loved seeing the world through Enzo's eyes.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|Having played the Star Wars pinball tables and several of the Marvel ones from Zen Studios on my XBOX 360 I jumped at this Star Wars themed one once I realized it was available for the Kindle Fire HD. The included THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK table (two others--THE CLONE WARS and BOBA FETT themed--are currently available as in-app purchases) is the best of the three available so far with very natural physics, great use of sounds effects and fun nods to the film. Highly recommended for fans of video pinball games and/or Star Wars.
B000SJJCX4|5.0|I bought this instead of the boss TU3 tuner. This Tuner by Behringer is 70 bucks less than that boss tuner and offers the SAME EXACT FEATURES and a sleek grey look instead of the white of the tu3. The only difference is that all the boss compact pedals are much easier to install the battery.<br /><br />My suggestion is that if you are making a pedal board on a budget...buy this instead of the TU3
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|lawd have mercy, i was caught off guard, then hit by waves of emotion as i tried to fathom the turbid horror followed by the ragged humanity portrayed in this film. Attempting to put myself in their shoes humbled and rattled me to my essence...all could be snatched up and scattered into the jaws of the maelstrom in this precarious existence on this ever evolving planet, keeping your head and giving of yourself in the aid of others seems to be the most productive and noble of strategies..\\"even if its the last thing we do\\".  not knowing the actual details related from the first hand accounts of this epic ordeal, i still felt satisfied that it represented a truth. can you imagine yourself thrust into a similar situation?  the lead actress relinquished herself to the role like her character did to the oncoming wave of churning sea and debris; deserving of her oscarly accolades.
B0086700CM|5.0|Very addicting... My kids and I love it! Hopefully they can work the bugs out of Temple Run 2 as well!
B00B7IJDMA|4.0|I may have worn out this CD's welcome too quickly as i became addicted to the albums first three songs.  I kinda felt like the atmosphere of the album got lost somehwere between Baby Bee's &#34;Love Bug&#34; and Of Monsters and Men's &#34;Sinking Man&#34;.  Also with only 8 songs attributed to Volume 1 I feel like I should have gotten more out of it.<br /><br />Just like the show though I am hooked on this album and am dying for more.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|Although this dragged a bit, and repeated itself story moved along.  The characters were alive on the page,  and I will read this author again.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Being a horse lover myself I bought this for my Grandson since he now has fallen in love with horses plus the story within it is awesome!
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|What a Stupid Movie!  The only thing good about it is Mila Kunis!  She's Hot! Besides that the movie sucked! As I said, what a stupid movie!  Unfortunately I was stupid enough to pay and see this crap!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Very good and free app. I love playing this tiles game for a long time and was searching for such app on my Kindle Fire HD.
B008XCJ03K|4.0|As much as I do like the style of this artist, I feel that many songs on the album are lacking. Their are a lot of songs on this album, and I feel like their could have been less songs of better quality. I am the type who likes to put the album on and let it play all day. With this one I find myself pressing next to pass several songs, with only a few that I truly care for. This is no The Lumineer's, Of Monsters and Men, or AWOLNATION.
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|This is an easy and quick read, yet very useful. Great stories backed up with data and very eye opening.
057809665X|5.0|I purchased this for a gift as it has useful techniques that could benefit communication with clients and peers, that I thought maybe it would help them.
B009R659L8|5.0|This novel was a classic Mary Higgins Clark.  There are various plots and twists that keep the reader on edge throughout.  Characters are introduced with their own agendas and the reader is forced to change their mind as to &#34;who done it&#34;.  I enjoyed the book and would encourage anyone that likes Clark's style to read it.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Very boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not very interesting. I don´t like this book at all. It could be interesting to other people but I don´t like this book . I don´t know what to give this book at all.
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|One of the worst movies in a long time, if you see it late at night it will help to sleep
B007MU85D0|5.0|I heard about this band in an interview done with AWOLNATION. I listened to a few of the clips provided by amazon and couldn't really get a feel for it, but AWOL has never disappointed me with his playlist. So I took a chance and bought the album. I love it. It's an amazing album filled with emotion and thoughts that most people will not put on paper. I find that there is a lot of hidden meaning in their songs. The album is calm and makes for a relaxing day.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I am a big fan of Supernatural. This series really catch my attention. Bought season 5 to carry on with the series. Excellent
B000W4D94I|1.0|I was so excited when I received this &#34;Blu Ray&#34; Movie, but once I opened it, inside was a DVD.  Horrible!
B00632KSXI|4.0|The best track on the album, Sail, sounds way different on vinyl. Overall, it still sounds better than the cd.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|Loved it--would recommend it to anyone.  Enjoyed playing it --thought I could rate it quickly but they require too many words!!
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|It's interesting, but just another Bond movie to me.  It held my interest, but nothing to write home about.  Thanks
B005RAO0GS|3.0|I really thought I would love this album, as I love the songs that have been most popular to the general public. However, I found that I am skipping past several songs to hear the one's I like. I just despise albums that are not at least 85% satisfying. Perhaps this is just not my style.
B004GYY714|5.0|I like the variety of music available and well as the ease of usage.<br />I heard about it from a friend
B005NKGEP2|5.0|Excellent book on espionnage, Europe and the expat life. I work on a medium where expats are rather the norm than the exception, and every single one of his remarks was easy to relate to.<br /><br />However, reading a book about being an expat would be boring. Reading a novel as well plotted and twisted as this one was a pleasure. The main character rivals Carrie Mathisson from Homeland in bad-assness and complexity, and manages to have little kids (think Carrie's sister gone dark!) and every single one of the secondary characters, even those who only have a few lines, are rich, rounded and filled with tasty clues and foreshadowing.<br /><br />The ending is oddly satisfying too, specially taking into account the breathless beginning that will make buying underwear for your kids a trip to H&M to remember.
B008LD09LS|5.0|I tried the fruit brand applications and once I found that I could use my Kindle Fire with this app I downloaded it immediately.  The ability to just  tilt the Kindle FIre is so much more intuitive it's no comparison to the joy stick operation of others.  So simple and easy to control...<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon for not following the stance that brand orange took................you know you can'tcompare Amazon's and........uhhhh.....uhhhh oranges.
B00AGJ4HC2|4.0|This is an enjoyable little game suitable for playing in restaurants - or anywhere.  I suggest you sleeve the cards even if you don't usually.  There is a LOT of shuffling involved and the cards are a bit thin.
B00B7HQ1DA|4.0|So great to hear from him again.  He makes these old songs new again.  Some real nice rhythm guitar work. My fav is the old Steely Dan tune &#34;pearl of the Quarter&#34;.
B007M45PMU|5.0|This is another band that I was introduced to by an AWOLNATION interview. I wander if he knows how much influence he has? The album is pretty indie, but very amazing. I had this album before 'Ho Hey' went mainstream, and I love that song, but it doesn't even come close to representing the entire album. 'Classy Girls' is a favorite, along with 'Slow It Down', 'Big Parade', and 'Flapper Girls'. I give this album 10/10. It is an all day listen, with no skipping tracks to get to the next 'good' song.
B00BMCLCG6|4.0|Songs are great and typical Bon Jovi.  I'm a long time fan and I love how his music has evolved over time.
B003DZX44I|5.0|One of my all time favorite Disney movies. I love the music and the story, reminds me that fairy tales can come true
B008YKRRH2|4.0|Otto Klemperer's artistic temperament was ideally suited to the interpretation of Bruckner. Well-known in his later career, some might say notorious, for markedly slow tempi, the conductor's approach didn't always work well with every piece, and his failures could be as spectacular as his successes were sublime. Among those less-than stellar efforts, the odd, logy reading of Schumann's \\"Rhenish\\" Symphony from 1969, and the singularly awful 1966 recording of the Beethoven Violin Concerto with Yehudi Menuhin come immediately to mind. Brilliant successes include near-definitive renditions of the Brahms Violin Concerto with David Oistrakh (1960) and \\"German Requiem\\" (1961), Schubert's \\"Great C Major\\" Symphony (1960), Mahler's 9th Symphony (1967) and \\"Das Lied von der Erde\\" (1964).  Klemperer's Bruckner, if not always rarefied, is nonetheless, consistently fine. Though massive in scope, often sprawling in their cathedral-like scale, these symphonies aren't particularly complex or structurally convoluted, and this is precisely the kind of musical environment in which Klemperer was able to thrive. Like the most sensitive and committed of tour guides, he gives his listeners time to take in the full grandeur of Bruckner's architecture before moving them along, remarking on details that might otherwise easily be overlooked by a more hurried docent.<br /><br />Issued in 2012, this attractive box set from EMI offers consistently well-turned performances of six of Bruckner's ten symphonies recorded between 1960 and 1970; #s 4 (1963) and 7 (1960) were recorded with the Philharmonia Orchestra; #5 (1967), #6 (1964), #8 (October-November 1970), and #9 (February 1970) with the New Philharmonia. Remasterings were done between 1990 and 2004, and the quality of the present transfer is excellent.  Bruckner aficionados should note that these are the Novak editions, with the exception of Symphony #7, which employs the Haas edition.<br /><br />Comparisons with the near-contemporaneous recordings by Bruno Walter and the Columbia Symphony may be inevitable. I prefer Klemperer's 4th, especially the near-perfect pacing in the slow second movement. (My benchmark recording of the \\"Romantic\\" Symphony is Daniel Barenboim with the Chicago Symphony on DG, currently available in a ten-disc Collector's Edition box.) Walter and Klemperer's interpretations of the 7th are equally satisfying, but I give the laurel unhesitatingly to Walter in the 9th, next to whom, Klemperer seems rather lightweight where dynamic contrast is concerned. Walter's long-line is more forcefully coherent, and Columbia's recorded sound is breathtaking--a pinnacle achievement in early stereo recording. EMI's sound, while perfectly adequate, is not particularly memorable.<br /><br />While it's too bad Walter never found time to record the 6th and 8th symphonies, these two works are among the true treasures of the Klemperer set. And, as much as I admire the superbly energetic and better-sounding recordings of Bernard Haitink (with the Concertgebouw on Philips) and Pierre Boulez (with the Vienna Philharmonic on DG), I absolutely LOVE Klemperer's stately reading of the 8th; the slower tempo of the scherzo lends greater weight to what is already a work of awesome power. There's less competition when it comes to the smaller-scale 6th. This too, is an excellent reading; one might even call it Bruckner at his most intimate, a spirit Klemperer captures most admirably.  As to the 5th; it is a work I have never much warmed to. I have no doubt those who admire the piece will think highly of Klemperer's reading, but, for me personally, this recording does little to change my opinion.<br /><br />It's lovely to have these superb performances gathered together under a single cover, and at an attractively modest price, too. Bruckner fans, Klemperer complete-ists, admirers of classic stereo, and lovers of great music should all be delighted.
B009G78EE2|3.0|Nice songs and Amazon has the explicit version much cheaper. But the explicit is nothing like the radio version. If you like the radio version and do not like profanity obviously stay away from the uncensored version even though Amazon has it at about half the price of the non explicit version
B00CL6HGIK|1.0|i am reminded yet again of the horrible connection that amazon has. my wife wanted to see this movie but we had to keep refreshing the page and making it full screen again. ruined our movie experience. do not use instant video!
B000H4QD1O|5.0|A really great series and I can't believe it was cut short.  If kickstarter can fund a Veronica Mars movie why can't we have another go at Firefly.  I'd be a contributor from day one.  Long live Firefly.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|great read. Kathy Reichs puts you in the story with her characters and locales. Great blending of history, facts, and plot to keep reader involved.
B008M0UTRO|5.0|I watched this on TV in my hotel room in Ikebukuru, Tokyo. It was in Japanese only and was so captivating. I bought this edition, and was able to watch with subtitles. I love this movie, as does my wife. Yes, it is a romance, but not only for young people. This is a movie for anyone with a really romantic spirit. A beautifully drawn picture of Japan in the 60's.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This story was beautifully written and gave me a keener insight to what a quadraplegic encounters in daily living. I loved the character developemnt and would recommend this to my friends
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This is not at the level of presumed innocent.  That said, the content is compelling and I liked the behavioral genetics theme.
1452115567|5.0|I love this book, it's very well done. Maddie will always bring a smile to your face. Why We Rescue is a great cause.
B00A72989U|5.0|Album is terrific, as well as, her concert at United Center (5 stars!!!!!!)<br />Highly recommended. Very good album  very much like other albums
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Purchased Entire Series at Barnes& Noble<br /><br />One of the best series ever conceived.  A spirited family drama that couples romance, comedy, and history seamlessly.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a great challage to play and fun. It's. One of those games that when you start playing you can't stop playing and hours and hours go by and you don't know it cause you caught up in the fun.
0446560065|5.0|I got this book many months after watching your videos on YouTube. The drawings and short comic strips are absoulately adorable and I leave them at my work desk to enjoy whenever I need it.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Gotta get this game. Are you up to the task?  This game might you keep up at night trying to beat it.
B000Z66RSS|5.0|Love all of the music from these movies. Great music for a workout or even just to give a lift so the soul.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Really haven't found anything to complain about.  Works as expected.  I have used other RDP apps on my Sony tablet but they were quickly uninstalled after using Jump for a day.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|A movie the whole family really liked.  The only questionable part, for younger children, was very close to the end when the characters meet the villain in his true form.  My 5 year old was a little scared during that part, but only remembers the fun parts of the movie.  Also, a trip down memory lane for us who grew up in the 80s with the video games.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|I got this game thinking it would be fun for my kids to play, and I'm enjoying it alot more than I expected. The graphics are entertaining, and you have multiple player options, or the ability for 1 person against the computer. I highly recommend this game for all ages.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|Really enjoyed it. I just recently got hooked on this show and I have been going blind trying to see the back seasons on YouTube.<br />Frustration, got the best of me and I bought this to give me more flexibility with where, when and how I watched these episodes.  I really couldn't tell that it was used.
1439153663|5.0|This book takes a different look at slavery before the Civil War, from two perspectives - a white child who is an indentured servant, and a slave whose white father owned the plantation.  Many twists and turns.  Very exciting, and of course, sometimes very sad.
B005MLPJ44|5.0|would love to watch this show but although I pay in advance for Amazon Prime every year it does not consistently stream the shows and I cannot locate any customer serrvice contact info
B007MB5OCE|3.0|Overall I liked it. There were so many characters with no many back stories, that I got a little confused. I kept wishing he would get on with the story because I wanted to know what happened.
1574214276|5.0|Good book.  I enjoy the step by step instructions given and all the variations.  We had a tangle workshop and the book helped.
B003L7DK74|5.0|I love Flight of the Conchords!!!! I've been waiting on the price to drop so I could add this to my collection.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Preston and Child have created a very unusual character in FBI Agent Pendergast.  He is almost peculiarly ethereal.  I think he was the reason that I kept reading books by these authors.  However, as I have felt before,  sometimes they seem to write themselves into a difficult corner.  As I indicated in my title, I felt that I did not know facts that must have been covered in another previous book.  I had no idea why Constance Green was in a mental hospital.  I'd aslo forgotten that she was Agent Pendergast's ward.  I did not know that the agent was married to someone named Helen.  The difficult corner in this book was the current Nazi genetics experiments.  Yes, I finished the book, but with a little sighing as I turned the pages.  Agent Pendergast's escape from the hands of the Nazis was barely believable.  My recommendation to other readers is that they start with an earlier book by these 2 authors.  They are good writers, they engage the reader and they can induce a mood.  Look out for the potential sucker punch.  That is, the ending may leave you disbelieving.
1611134226|5.0|Another hit out of the ball park for Preston and Child.  Each Pendergast novel just gets better and better and this was no exception.  I couldn't  put it down.  It moved at breakneck speed and I loved that they left the ending wide open for an Alban trilogy, and just like Diogenes and Judson Esterhazy, he is an exceptional villian, but with the added bonus that he's Pendergast's son.  I can't wait for the next novel.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|I truly enjoyed the “Game of Thrones” movies and fully plan to get every season that is released. The movies follow the books (Of which I also find very entertaining) the best I think any movie could. I highly recommend these movies for the serious “Game of Thrones” fan.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|its ok. a bit annoying i cant just play as long as i want. fun visually to look at. why isnt there candy crush for kindle?
B004LROUNG|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It was not among the best books I've ever read, of which I consider only two, but a very good and fast read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When I first downloaded this app I was unsure if I would truly enjoy it but within the hour I was hooked. Now I run the world with Subway Surfers! Can't get enough of the game and neither will you if you give it a try!
B00B0ND67K|5.0|The harmonies are incredible!  I love this album!  Thank you for introducing them,  [...]!  My son listens to them, too!
0738203335|5.0|Linux is awesome not only because its model, Unix, is so pervasive in our world, but also for the way in which Linux arose. Owning this book will help one to get a grip on just what a revolution Linux is. I am convinced that the world at large does not grasp the significance of Linux, and how collaboration on a global scale can be used not only for the development of software, but anything else that it is applied to.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was not into Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and 50 Shades of Gray was total garbage. This book was so well written, I whipped through all 3 of them quickly and wanted more more more! I am 28 years old. I know it was geared for teens, but even adults will love it.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for in a case. Looks great and very sturdy. Would definitely buy again and tell friends.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game!! It is the best!! It is really fun!! I can't wait till the next time I play!
B000HZD168|4.0|2nd best Star Trek movie to Star Trek IV The Voyage Home.  Seeing Ricardo Montalban play Kahn again was awesome.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Great control capacity with superior graphic action quality! Another quality product from Gameloft for the Kindle Fire! Along with a high level of finger swiping functionality this game sets the bar high!

0307476073|4.0|I've wanted to read Cheryl Strayed's books since she was outed as Dear Sugar and I first learned her name. I didn't truly know the premise of Wild, nor did I know enough about Strayed to know what to expect.<br /><br />I think her story is amazing, as is her storytelling ability. I only give four out of five stars because the writing is sometimes a bit more blog-like than literary or lyrical.<br /><br />I am shocked, amazed, and humbled by her courage. I have often wanted to escape, to learn answers, and to dare to be alone and penniless in order to get to the truth of things, but the journey Strayed made scared me just from the tale. I'm in awe.<br /><br />Though, as mentioned, her style is somewhat more blog-like, she can really tell a tale, and she has told this tale beautifully. I would definitely recommend this book.

B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Amazing costumes, scenery, acting, writing, characters. Everything except the soft core porn aspect of it is great. (A little too much unwarranted nudity.) Must watch!!!
B000IZ8SD8|2.0|Ugh, why do the new Star Trek movies have to deal so much with time travel.The movies that followed this one were better
B0084AXZK0|3.0|This was the second time I have read this book, the first time was many years ago. I think this was the only novel Oscar Wilde wrote, maybe just as well. I found the descriptions detailing the decadence of the members of the 19th century aristocratic elite produced very unappealing characters and a lot of the conversations contained in the book were pseudo intellectual rubbish. The start and finish of the book however held my attention but a lot of the rest of it really went nowhere for me. A bit of a disappointment the second time around.
B004RE29WW|5.0|Alien 3, the road trip version.  Here, things get a bit confusing.  Was there one or two eggs aboard the escape pod?  A face-hugger gets Ripley during the opening credits, and an ox is brought into the prison along with a second face-hugger.  It would appear that some major tampering was done to this film, causing director David Fincher to disavow all subsequent versions.  (I prefer the 2003 reedit.)  Even so, this film is a sentimental favorite for its outlandish approach to the problem of an Alien occupation.  Characters were allowed to flourish again, as in the first installment, with Charles Dance and Charles S. Dutton as standouts.  Poor Pete Postlethwaite was wasted in a nothing role that never allowed him to display his considerable talents.  I love the look of this film, the sets and all, also enjoy the plot, and was greatly amused by the fact that Ripley is still the only character with an uncanny aptitude for always being right yet can't get anyone to listen to her until it's too late.  At this point, considering her predilection for survival is it just luck or is she a jinx?
B00123NWKE|4.0|Tommy Bolin makes his mark with this album. Worthy purchase for Bolin fans.  Decent purchase for Purple fans. 4 Stars if you like them both.
B00CBRH4YU|2.0|This film lacks luster and while the film is beautifully shot it is without impact. It drags on leaving the viewer not to question the deeper meaning of the film but ask rather why? Just leaves so much to be desired

B009K0P10K|4.0|The story line has good dialect and well acted. Characters are likeable even the villains. Enjoyed watching but plots are becoming more difficult to believe.
B004RE29PO|4.0|If one Alien was scary, how about hundreds!<br /><br />The first film was definitely Sci-Fi/horror; this sequel is a Sci-Fi/action flick without the heart and soul of the original.  Here, it's less about the people, more about the body count and the battles.  Few characters stand out or are memorable.  In one scene they're so rapidly diminished it's impossible to keep up with the tally or to notice who was now missing/gone for good.  Only Sigourney Weaver (Ripley) and Carrie Henn (Newt) reach any level of believable emotion.  Bill Paxton's comic turn as Private Hudson stood out only because he was allowed to carry on in a frightfully hammy way, all teeth and wild eyes.  Loud may get you noticed but it doesn't necessarily mean you're any better at acting than a two year old throwing a fit.  What propelled this film forward was the imminent sense of danger and breakneck speed of all the action sequences.  I like this movie, but I love the first.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great game. Plenty of characters. Monthly changes are very fun. If anything it could use some more characters and boards.
0345803485|4.0|I liked this book almost as good as the first one. It had my interest from page 1 through the end just like the first one. I cant wait to read the 3rd book. I recommend this book to everyone i know.

0805095535|4.0|Paul Auster has been one of my favorite authors for about 20 years and I have enjoyed all his writing, starting with &#34;Country of Last Things&#34; which was amazingly inventive, in my opinion.  His &#34;Invention of Solitude&#34; was next and on and on from there.  I ALWAYS recommend Paul!
0887307280|3.0|Didn't use it too much. However, it did explain the mananger/entrepreneur/technician concept well with stories. Just because you are good at what you do, doesn't mean you should open your own business.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Similar to temple run without having to manipulate the board by moving & tilting it. Love the game,but hate that the review has to be 20 words!! Not worth having to do a review. What is this school!?! Try it. Like it or delete it. Your choice.

B0049J2BSM|5.0|I loved it in the theaters and I enjoyed again at home years later....wow! it has actually been YEARS since it came out. I'm getting old. Haha
0743244257|5.0|I hate to finger through a book that has smelly, waxy pages, but that wasn't the case with this product!  This book is several years old, but it looked like it was just released from the printer's shop!  This is why I particulary love to order from Amazon.  It's great to order something old, yet in new condition.  Amazon, thanks for having the pot with old goodies! (Charlotte, N.C.)
B008476HBM|2.0|Although this book is known as a classic and read in many schoolrooms, I found it long and boring. Austen writes in a way that I felt was rambling - a lot of useless conversation in the story and difficult to follow the English style if writing. The base story is interesting but easily could have been delivered in a shorter version.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I bought this for my 12 year old and he REALLY likes it and was very excited to get!!  Looked all over for this set and his happiness over receiving it made the price well worth it!!  Extra fast shipping and it was in perfect condition! Small pieces, but we knew what we were getting and that was okay.  My kiddo keeps it on display on his dresser and changes it up about once a week. [[ASIN:B007PVHMCG LEGO Minecraft 21102]]
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I love this Cd and really i love anything she sings.She is such a good singer and a performer.. My six year old granddaughter can sing one of her songs.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I decided to read this after seeing the trailer for the movie. I have not seen the movie, but what a great read this was. With mental illness paraded around in the news and media so much today, it was interesting how this novel dealt with it. Granted, I was thinking there was going to be something far sinister in the past that started Pat's descent, I was glad it wasn't. Worth the time.
B00BESLHEA|4.0|It was totally worth the hype but some of the action scenes seemed B-Movie-ish. I would definitely watch it again.
B00A83075M|5.0|It's a very cute movie that my granddaugher loves to watch over & over. Has a nice message for the kids to watch
B003CH9PTU|5.0|I suggest you buy all 5 seasons, take a long weekend off from your life and watch from first to last. AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!

B0063B2BNE|5.0|I gave the rating of 5 stars since the show has been great from the start. Growing up in the 90's, you recognize the one of the main characters as \\"Angel\\" from the Buffy series. However, I can definitely say David Boreanaz fits well into the character \\"Booth\\". The dynamic of all characters play out well in the multitude of plots.

B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|Can't use the controls sucking game I think the writers of the game should work using their brained instead of not using it
B000I186FW|4.0|I enjoyed V's monologues the most. The story developed a plot without making you keep track of too many interlocking twists. Also, the monologues can help expand your vocabulary if you listen carefully. &#34;Remember, Remember the fifth of November&#34;.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Aside from the totally ridiculous amount of violence, this movie rocks. Jamie Foxx is one in 10 million. And I couldn't understand why Christolph Walstz was getting so many accolades for his role...until I saw the movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I actually wasn't sure about writing a review on this series.  After all, with all the hype, there are about a million of them out there.  But this series brought me back into the reading world and in a way helped me feel like I finally was coming home.<br />Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey are two completely different characters from completely different worlds.  If you haven't heard of this story then you probably have been living under a rock.  E L James (who used to write fanfic for the Twilight series) pulls us into a world of erotic games and loads of money, power, and innocence.<br />Let's start with Ana's character.  An attractive brunette who is naive, innocent, and determined to have her own life.  I think my first thought was, \\"How can anyone in their early twenties be this naive and innocent?\\".  After all we live in a society where innocence is lost so young.  But there is something about Ana that just makes you believe it.  Her character is a stuttering mess and like all of us tends to say the wrong things at the wrong time.  Something I found throughout this book to be both annoying and enduring.<br />Christian on the other hand is anything but innocent.  Having been born to someone who was essentially the worst mother ever, he has taken his hard knocks early.  Although adopted into a loving and wealthy family, he still has some serious demons he is working through.  He is bossy and overtly dominant.  To the point that I actually found myself saying out loud that if I were Ana I would be out the door!  As you know, if you show that kind of intense emotion when reading a novel it has to be good.<br />Christian takes Ana on a journey of self discovery and passion.  He takes her innocence and still manages to show her an affection she has never known.  We watch with anticipation, as Christian makes Ana succumb to his lifestyle and how Ana struggles with the choice of making this part of her world.  I appreciate Ana's hesitation and Christian's insistence.  So many times we see characters go from \\"No.  I'm not that kind of girl!\\" to panting and moaning in a matter of a few paragraphs.  E L James makes you work for your satisfaction!<br />I believed that regardless of how much money Christian has (which btw was a ridiculous amount) or how innocent Ana is (I mean really?  A virgin still?), these two people could fall in love.  Could be everything to one another.  And that is why I had to keep reading even when I wanted to scratch Christian's eyes out or smack Ana upside the head for saying something dumb.  I needed there to be a happily ever after.<br />And at the end of this book...there isn't one.  As a matter of fact, the ending is heart wrenching.  I was so devastated at the end of this book that I immediately bought the next book just so I would not be so depressed.  E L James brought me back to reading, just to break my heart.  And I couldn't be happier.ce.  So many times we see characters go from \\"No.  I'm not that kind of girl!\\" to panting and moaning in a matter of a few paragraphs.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|This has really good graphics. It is really enjoyable. But they added ads which takes a while to get back to the game.
0307950689|2.0|There's a phenomenon in music called the second album syndrome, where a band will have a hugely successful first album and be so discombobulated by the adulation that their sophomore outing is meandering and weak. The DaVinci Code was not Dan Brown's first book, but it might as well have been, given it's roaring success, and here he has apparently fallen victim to the second album syndrome. In trying to duplicate the earlier book, he has created a hollow frame with nothing in it. The quest here is for the vague \\"ancient mysteries.\\" We never do find out what they really are--well, we do, but it is remarkably unsatisfying, bland, obvious, and amorphous; more like a New Age bumper sticker. And the excitement and suspense are all manufactured and amped up: there are any number of places where you get phrases like \\"Without warning, the phone rang!\\" (Personally, my phone always warns me before it rings.) And the gimmick of the two-page chapters with pseudo-cliffhanger endings seems more gimmicky than ever. Like the DaVinci code, this book relies on hackneyed movers in the shadows, only this time, instead of the Church, we have the other two standard elements from central casting, the CIA and the Masons. In place of invention or originality, we have the fascination with arcania, combined to create a web of apparent larger meaning. Some of this arcania is actually arcane and interesting, but most of it is Wikipedia-level stuff (brace yourself: the founding fathers were Masons!). Mr. Brown would be better served by relaxing a little, spending some time finding novel villains, trusting the suspense inherent in his subject matter, and letting his books breath a little. Maybe even allow for some character development through exposition rather than explanation (every character here, even the most minor, dutifully gets a stock life history tacked on like a party hat). This book does have one genuine plot twist toward the end, and it has enormous potential moral and emotional implications for one of the characters, but Brown drops the ball, giving it only the most token recognition and moving instead to the next amped up plot development. Perhaps, as other reviewers have noted, he will now have gotten the intimidation of his earlier success out of his blood and the next book will be better. Let's hope.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This app is a lot of fun. I didn't realize how much this game had to it until I sat down and played for a good hour. Careful, it does suck you in... but what's nice is that every time you die, you don't lose progress so you can easily play one round, put it down and come back later. I have tried Hungry Shark 1, and that doesn't even come close to this installment. You should definitely try this game!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The storyline was interesting, informative and surprising in many ways. It showed some of the difficult suffering that took place in orphanages in Ireland, but the story shifts focus frequently, so as to make it less depressing as you are experiencing the storyline. Many unexpected twists. Written very well, very imaginative!
B008Y7BE7E|4.0|This is a very dark, yet funny movie.  Very good cast.  The ending is a bit corny but in all this is one that I find myself watching now and again when i need a good laugh.

B000B589JI|4.0|i am a zippo lighter kind of person, so use my lighter a lot! what is cool about this is that it clips right on your belt buckle, it is small enough to carry with you everywhere, and when you trying to get a flame and your out of fuel, you take out your canister, it has a flat piece of stainless to uncrew your wick spring, and a black piece of rubber so you can store an extra wick, the fuel is stored under a double cap, the reason i gave it four stars is cause when you tip the canister to put fuel into your lighter, there is a tiny vent so fuel will flow out, but you cant tell if is comimg out or not, cause you cant squeez the canister, it does take some getting used too, but i use it all the time.

B006GWO5NE|4.0|I purchased this by accident and Amazon let me keep it.  It is the same one that came with my Kindle Fire, so it will be good to have a spare on hand in case the other one gets lost.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This third season is filled with joyful events but also many sad ones. However, the series is captivating and well worth watching. The context involves the changes from the Victorian period to post World War years. The times they were a changing. It is evident in the constant challenges to the old ways and is also evident in the styles, especially those of the women's dresses. The days of the flapper emerge along with the expansion of women's roles, just a beginning, but here you will find the seeds that eventually bloom. Yet the struggle for women's rights and equality continues.

I originally downloaded it for my five year old son but I find myself playing it more and more. I think it is a lot of fun and addictive! The only thing that could make it better for kids is if the goals were read because I have to read it to my son, I don't mind but he gets tired of asking me. I'm never giving up this app!

1742200508|5.0|`Lonely Planet' has arguably, one of the best comprehensive guides to England that is currently available.  This 850-page guide covers England in (12) twelve different districts in great detail.  There are also (4) four helpful chapters to start before you plan your trip:<br /><br />*Plan Your Trip<br />*On the Road<br />*Understand England<br />*Survival Guide<br /><br />There are several maps throughout ranging from 1\\"=50 miles, to 1\\"=200m (656 feet), plus a handy fold-out map of London showing all points of interest and a great guide to the famous London Underground.  When planning our trip, you get the Top 20 Experiences, first timers' advice, new events, itineraries, regions at a glance and more.  The section on `Understand England' is essential to knowing the history, eating habits, architecture, English landscape, the arts and sporting.  It's a very good introduction if a tad overwhelming.  With `On the Road', you have a complete destination guide with in-depth reviews, listings and insider tips on lodging, restaurants, pubs, transportation, sights & activities, festivals and more.  Addresses, phone numbers, hours of service and pricing are all up to date with this edition.  The survival guide is only about 36 pages, but covers all the essentials to traveling in England.  The list is comprehensive and covers accommodations to Visas and everything in-between.  It also goes into detail about transportation, whether it is air, car, train, bus or ferry.<br /><br />The size is typical of most guide books (about 1-1/4\\" thick), but it's worth noting that it covers just about any question you could ask.  Since I plan on going to the UK this fall, I am already pursuing the `Plan Your Trip' portion just to get a good start.  Lonely Planet also offers E-books for those with a pad.  It's a great way to avoid carrying heavy books!

Russell following his multi-award winning \\"The Fighter\\".<br />It is another finely choreographed ensemble piece with excellent script, direction and acting.<br />Everyone in it was great, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence (Best Actress Award), Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver from<br />\\"Animal Kingdom\\", Chris Tucker and everyone else.<br />De Niro has not been this great for years and Bradley Cooper gave his career's best.<br />It is a story about flawed lives, family loves and hopes among adversity.<br />It is uplifting, very funny with a sense of melancholy.<br />The most precious of all is that everyone involved in this film seemed to have a great time.<br />One of this year's best.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|wonderful app with beautiful graphics./I have all my favorite cities and nearby small towns. I know the weather where each of our kids live.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|My son wanted to see the series and we were very glad that it was here to be rented at an affordable rate so he could see this classic movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great end to one and two.  I wish there was a season four or five or six or seven or eight.
B00BO2VKBG|4.0|These guys are fantastic!  If you're into retro blues rock, metal and psychedelia music, you should definitely check these guys out.  Their sound is sort of like a mash up of Beatles and Black Sabbath, but the end result is far better than what that combo might conjure in your mind.
B001E45XT4|3.0|This headset was good but it was lacking the time i could wear it. This hurt my head after i wore it for more then 2 hours and i would have to take it off. Maybe its just how my head is shaped. Other then that the sound quality is good for a 2.1 headset and the mic is very clear.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|So well written! You are missing out if you haven't seen yet.  My husband and I love watching it together.
B00153ZC8Q|5.0|I rented this for my 11 year old son because I figured it was time to share one of the BEST movies ever made with him and it didn't disappoint him either! sci-fi CLASSIC!

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|since I watched the movie and immediately fell in love, it is so exciting to have a game to play now
B000OLGCHA|5.0|Great score!!  Has some of the most recognizable scores from Harry Potter movies.  Umbridge song is the best.  Great CD!!
B0014C0BMU|5.0|I rented this with my son so we could finidh up the trilogy and we were glad that it was here and affordable.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Beautiful graphics, fun quests and no need to have lots of friends or spend $$  to get ahead and enjoy the game.
145210655X|3.0|I bought this as a present.  After anxiously waiting it finally arrived.  I couldn't wait to read the story of a day in the life of Darth Vader and Luke.  After about five pages I realized there isn't a story line.  Every page is like a new thought.  I guess it's great for children with a very short attention span.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is great. Totally reminds me of playing Mario on the old school Nintendo when I was a kid. One of the best free apps I have found for the kindle. I would highly recommend this game.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|Comes with two options of U-Bolt Bases, one small and one long to fit different size handles. Very simple to set up, get it with other RAM Mount hardware to complete a perfectly functional set.
1582406723|5.0|I have to a might I wasn't sure about these books but I saw the TV show and really loved it so I thought I should read the manga
B00364K6YW|5.0|I Like this way better, it's longer and gets you more into the story, also, the actors seem more in tune with the era it was written for.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Wonderful game, the 3D effect was great.  Can't wait for the next one!  Wasn't near<br /><br />long enough for me though.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love Love this app. Love being able to find different item and following friends favorite receipts, and decoration ideas. Love that you can put on your sight on facebook. Love that my friends on facebook can grab a item they like and re-pin it on their sight. Love the way I can get a receipt and place it in my chef tap cookbook.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read this book almost a year ago and I still remember EVERYTHING thing about it. This series was the catalysts for me discovering my love of reading. This is an absolute must read for anyone who loves a good romantic, erotic love story. Of coarse I am speaking about the series as a whole.
B00081U7HC|4.0|I seen this movie many times on television.  My husand and I both enjoyed it.  It was great to see a young woman to rise from living in the streets to getting out of a bad life style into marrying a kind man who cared about her ...
B00CL68NOG|5.0|It was not a comedy but more a dramady.  I think streisand did a great job.  Watched it twice. Even better the second time.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Say good bye too purchasing diamonds instead you can kill other players in the game. If you want you can still buy diamonds. But it's up too you what will you do with your money spend it on diamonds or earn diamonds by killing other players in multiplayer PvP you can even help your friends and others in Co-op.

B008RV5K4U|4.0|The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and its sequel the Dark Knight Returns Part 2, are both animated movies of the DC animated line-up produced by Bruce Tim and his crew. Dark Knight Returns part one and two are based Frank Miller's famous comic of the same name. The Dark Knight Returns along with Watchmen is hailed as one of the best comics ever written. I can see why people think that way. Dark Knight Returns is not my favorite Batman but I do respect it and Watchmen. They both dealt with many heavy themes that not to many comics at the time would touch, and they were very dark as well.<br /><br />This review will be on The Dark Knight Returns Part 1. The film revolves around this gang known as the mutants. This gang is wreaking havoc in Gotham, and the police are powerless. At the same time you have an aging Bruce Wayne, who has retired, observing these terrible acts of crime. Ultimately he forces himself back into the game. The story revolves around Batman and his new sidekick, Carrie Kelly a.k.a. Robin, taking back Gotham from the mutants.<br /><br />I really enjoy this film. I do not like these films as much as the animated series or Nolan's Batman films, but I still highly enjoy them. Batman is awesome and more brutal than ever. Despite being old Batman kicks a lot of ass and is very brutal as well. Like Bruce Greenwood in Under the Red Hood, Peter Weller's voice took some getting used to, but it grew on me.<br /><br />The character Carries Kelly surprised me a bit. I've never been that big a fan of Robin. In most incarnations I find him annoying like in Batman and Robin. However, this Robin was not annoying, and can be useful. Although she does not get a whole lot to do in this film, she does have her moments. Ariel Winter did a nice job voicing Carrie.<br /><br />The rest of the voice cast did a good job as well. The art took some getting used to. It is not as appealing to the eyes as other DC animated works. At least they did not use the art from the comic. However, the art grew on me over time. The animation is very smooth which made for some good action. The action is awesome and very well animated. The score was also decent.<br /><br />Overall this and Part 2 is a faithful adaptation to a great comic. Any fans of the Dark Knight returns comic should not be disappointed.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is a great one for those of us who enjoy breeding games. So many different dragons to create, and constantly more added. Also they keep the Kindle updated as much as any other device wich is a breath of fresh air. You will need to play this game for literally a year before you can aquire all the dragons. My ONLY complant is how HUGE this games data file is, and it's not really a complaint. This game takes about 500 to 600Mb of space up on my Kindle Fire. Other than that though this game is a must have for anyone who enjoys breeding games, and has a bit of time to spend playing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this book almost a year ago and I still remember EVERYTHING thing about it. This series was the catalysts for me discovering my love of reading.

B0064BCNA4|4.0|I love it. The sound is excellent for the piano and various other instruments.  The only negative is there is only one octave.
B00AFEXRME|1.0|How can one tout the worth of an honest-seeming movie about a dishonest man who lied to everyone, including himself. The hyped eulogies of Washington, Goodman and Zemeckis mis-led me; I use 'eulogies' here based on the dictionary definition of the word. Like: ...a piece of writing that praises someone highly, typically someone who has just died\\". Make that writing and every other aspect of film production.<br /><br />I have liked, respected and been entertained by every Denzel Washington<br />film from DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS to DEJA VU and many more. This jumbled, dark, negative movie is a terrible disappointment for me.<br /><br />If you need to be brought down, this movie will do it.<br /><br />It joins other miserable movies like [[ASIN:B003YZNDQQ Spun Unrated]] and [[ASIN:B0013O123Q Irreversible (English Subtitled)]]. I'm even very, very disappointed in myself for falling for the hyperbole of its hype. I'm even irked with myself using sanitized words of 'hyperbole' and 'hype' to describe it.<br /><br />Oh, even Robert Zemeckis'usual deft tough was slimed, with a drumming sameness, lack of meter, numb production and lame writing, editing and boring direction.
0688014291|2.0|I found the content to be mostly common sense and the narrative was a little &#34;preachy&#34;. I am hard pressed to say I found anything new in the presentation. All in all, just not worth the time spent.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Have only watched two but really enjoyed them.  Picture and sound quality is great. Looking forward to seeing the others.  Arrived quickly.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It does what it's supposed to do.  It's simple to use, fast, and accurate.  I recommend it for simple equations.
B0072OFM28|5.0|This has been one of the best series ever, so emotional and heart rending, the filming was superb as was the acting!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I like zombie stuff................dots don't work for words I don't want to do this and I think it is wrong.
B009R659L8|5.0|While there were lots of players in this story and at first, hard to keep them all straight; the ending brought them all together and answered all the questions.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Loved the way the author jumped back and forth between 1940's and current time!  Excellent development of characters!  There have been very few books that I have hated to finish.......this was definitely one of them!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game! I am a mom of two teenage kids and usually I play the match 3 type of games. This one took me a bit. I die alot but that's because I cant react that quick anymore. I have been improving. The game is fun! Something challenging but different from my normal games. I'm glad to be able to play something that preteens are playing. Gives me something in common with them
B0063IH60K|1.0|Easy to use and fun. The ads are annoying but not excessive. I would recommend this for easy mindless fun.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|good game. puzzle type with extra reward for speed and thoughtful solutions.  don't start this game at 3am after all your word friends have gone to bed.
111846446X|5.0|This book came with the package i bought. Simple enough that my 10 year old can follow it without me. Good starter book for the novice.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|I just downloaded this to my I Phone and and still leaning....Its been great learning a new game my husband has enjoyed it also.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I love using this app. ive made countless lists and made numberous goals and I'm writing an original story using this app. what scares me though is that from what ive seen, evermore can distribute what you write to partners, making me extremely nervous about using this app. not that I think they would take my shopping lists, but I'm afraid story ideas and things like that may be taken from me and it scares me to death. this is a dilemma for me because this is the best notepad app I have. I have about six different writing apps, and not one compares to evernote, but I find myself questioning the risk.
B001LX2J22|4.0|Time has been fairly kind to Brett Ratner's &#34;Red Dragon&#34;.  It's not as &#34;cool&#34; as Michael Mann's &#34;Manhunter&#34; (also based on Thomas Harris' book &#34;Red Dragon&#34;), but it's a well-made film with a rock-solid cast.  Sure, it's a little disconcerting to see an older/fatter/hammier Anthony Hopkins playing a younger Lecter (and that ponytail...really?).  But as always, he is riveting.  And a pre-Voldemort Ralph Finnes is great, too.  In fact, I enjoyed all of the performances.  And Ratner's direction is fairly restrained.  For him, anyway.  All in all, &#34;Red Dragon&#34; makes for a fine prequel to the classic &#34;Silence of the Lambs&#34;.  And, hey...At least it's better than &#34;Hannibal Rising&#34;!
B007URVZJ6|3.0|Building your book for Kindle is easy. This pamphlet is mostly downloaded. It's okay, but I have found easier ways to build my books for Kindle and they seem to look great compared to others I've seen. This book came long after I learned how so I may be a bit on the biased side concerning this one.
B008XG1X18|5.0|We love the ideas and great products.  It gives us ideas  for decorating her new home.  We have already finished my grand daughters room.
B0025USXIO|5.0|The book is excellent---very thorough and extensive, but simple and straightforwrd explanations, and easy to use examples--- worth reading and re-reading multiple times. Wish the website quiz examiner was available on my Kindle.
B005FNSJDC|5.0|MUY BUEN PRODUCTO
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book is dry well written with some I retesting plot revelations.  It is a quick read.  It didn't blow me away, but I'd recommend reading if you have a little spare time.
B001AITH50|5.0|The first film adaptation of Anne Rice's flagship novel never fails to impress me.  Although there are a number of discrepancies from the book the movie has enough gravitas on its own to maintain staying power as an impressive storyline in its own right.<br /><br />The surprise performance of Tom Cruise in his portrayal of the vampire Lestat defied the expectations of both Ms. Rice and movie goers alike and is a rare instance of the actor maintaining the poise he demonstrated in \\"Born on the Fourth of July\\" as having the potential to be a legendary icon were he to maintain this level of commitment to all of his roles.  This movie undoubtedly owes much of its success to Cruise who not only brings Lestat to life from the pages but also adds an air of the character's mischievous nature bordering on evil due to his full acceptance of vampiricism.<br /><br />There have been mixed critiques of Pitt's role, many of which allude to a belief he demonstrated the same level of apathy that led to the awkward and often considered disastrous performance in \\"Meet Joe Black.\\"  I disagree and tend to think this was his first truly distinguished role before \\"Legends of the Fall\\" because he faithfully captured Louis's somber and morose reluctance to embrace the necessity of nightstalking to maintain his existence once transformed.  Some may consider Kirsten Dunst's performance somewhat over the top but it is a gifted casting of a promising prodigy child star.<br /><br />The scenery and costumes are excellent given that this movie predates CGI and its cheapening effects for bombast.  The storyline is pretty easy to follow although Pitt's narration seems a bit mellow and forced during the abrupt transitions during decades.  The portion focusing on a Parisian vampire troupe in Paris has a bit of a non sequitur sentiment that lacks a smooth segue, but it provides a necessary explanation of the greater existential questions of vampirism.  Antonio Banderas has a very independent role as Armand that resembles the characters in Rice's series in no form or fashion but is captivating regardless, although his role as an explanatory elder lacks satisfactory completion to substantively provide the audience with more than a predictable mythos for nosferatu in general.  The scenery for Spanish Colonial New Orleans is also much more engrossing than nineteenth century Paris but it isn't much of an issue for the themes in each chapter.<br /><br />The only real drawback of the film is that it loses most of its momentum halfway through and becomes somewhat of a lumbering philosophical account involving navel gazing and devolves into a vampire massacre with primal notions of undead justice that could be misconstrued as an attempt to liven the overly analytical storyline.  This film has its share of violence, onscreen blood, and some rather explicit nudity in a few places, and much of the obscure film noir mood may be somewhat depressing for general audiences who aren't attracted to historical periods or fantasy genres involving supernatural beings.  But its fairly realistic in terms of suspension of belief for \\"what if vampires really existed?\\" and does not devolve into the comic book extravagance typical of other films such as the \\"Dusk til Dawn\\" series that mirror the choreographed antics of Hong Kong martial arts action films.  Mostly this movie should appeal to contemplative cerebral luminaries that like to ask questions about the meaning of things and can maintain focus on a plot that takes some time to let its audience follow it to a conclusion.
B00493E1GI|3.0|Julia Roberts has carried out the role in a wonderful way . Loved the movie feels like to I need to go Bali :)
B00B0ND67K|5.0|Discovered this band watching the CA country music fest and had to have the music right away so I ordered the digital down load. Very satisfied with the music but had trouble with the down load and with getting it on CD.  I recommend ordering the CD instead. I will definately watch for thier next release.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  The combination of tech, mystery, and relationship threads made it a fun and compelling read.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|All Kindle gamers who can't connect to Facebook from other apps, delete this application & you should be alright. Good app if you do not game on Kindle.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|cant wait until i get the 2nd season<br />its funny, witty, and just a cool series<br />I hope USA doesnt cancel like they did the 4400<br />The writing is very original and even though they work on 2 cases each episode and outcome usually they win of course<br />still make it very entertaining with subplots<br />Hoffman is incredibly funny
0316381357|5.0|I absolutely love the movie with Audrey Hepburn so I bought the book to if it was good. It was great. It was a great story of sacrifice and tribute!
B0026IUXME|5.0|How amazing it is that anyone survived the terrible events of WWII.  This was a wonderful movie and so sincere, I liked the actors, the action, and the music that &#34;The Pianist&#34; played. I would highly recommend this movie to those that are interested in seeing a good movie that has a reason for being made.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Well written with wit and charm. You commiserate with the character even without the bond of mental illness. Love the twisted love story.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book was the 3rd best. It was just amazing though, still. Suzanne Collins has outdone herself. Awe. Some. Book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|After watching the movie, i wanted to get into a more in depth description of the story. So i baught this book. It was within a reasonable price and the shipment time was perfect. It arived witht the other things i had baught, and i ABSOLUTLY love it. Deffinatly recomend this book.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|It is a lot of fun but somewhat frustrating.  I say that because it takes awhile to go from one scene to another when you have completed a task.  I do look forward to continuing and completing more adventures!
B00067BBQE|5.0|I absolutely love this DVD. I recommend this for ANY Evanescence fan who wants to see what one of their concerts is like. The quality is just amazing from the audio to the camera angles! Very engaging. this is a one of a kind Evanesence concert DVD and a perfect gift for any Ev fan :)
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I thought this Kathy Reich's novel was exciting and page turning. I could not put the book down, waiting to see what happened next. Loved the love triangle going on with Ollie and Ryan. It was also nice to see Temperance work with new people, and learning about diamonds was exciting. You will be sorry if you don't read this.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Well written and well researched. I was saddened to read of the cruelty towards abandoned children even n up till 1996. Appalling cruelties. I enjoyed the reminiscing of his childhood but felt the story had a slow start. If the story had started with an excerpt from childhood it would have grabbed my attention sooner. Just recently returned from Ireland so it was fun to read of places I had just seen and words just learned. Thank you for a well written  book.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book it's a quick read, started a little slow, but soon picked up the pace. On more than one occasion I found myself reading into the wee hours of morning.  Its scary to think  the totalitarian could happen in this country.  It definitely makes you think.My friends who normally don't like fiction really liked it too.  My book club read it and out of 19 of us everyone gave it good reviews,
B005OCFGTO|5.0|It's great to finally have the complete Harry collection.  I received it earlier than expected, and am now enjoying the movies with my husband.  This DVD collection was less expensive than buying the movies separately on Blu-Ray.
B008RYN44U|5.0|I love this!! I just wasn't happy that I pre-ordered it and it came in after it was released in the stores.
B007LE2VDM|4.0|This album is better than I expected. I love her voice and how simple most her songs are. I hope she goes far.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|This was a gift . It was on the ladies amazon wish list...well she was so happy to get it ...she said it was really good...I got it time for her birthday...thank you.....
B00127RAJY|4.0|I love Jillian Michaels and these workouts are quick but very challenging.  It's a great extra workout I can squeeze in even after hitting the gym early in the day.  I'm up to workout #2 and looking forward to working my way up to #3.
B00C0YQLDE|5.0|I bought this after I got the tickets for their show coming to Dallas, and I was not disappointed. Very beautiful music. I hope they do another album with Andreya Triana because she is a beautiful singer. I love this album!
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|The game keeps both the kids and adults in the family entertained.  The only frustration I have found is that it alerts to an update each time we play, however no update appears when checking the menu for app updates.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|good , great, ....got it on time...it was a gift ...the person i gave it to ,,,said it was great ...She loved it....thank you
B00BVVA138|2.0|As much as I love kse I do not like this album even slightly.<br />I've tried to give it repeated listens but the songs all sound extremely generic.<br /><br />Kse is made up of talented musicians that seem to have started writing bland radio rock.<br />Many of the riffs sound like they're from other killswitch albums. With few songs showing promise and progression.<br /><br />The mix on the album is down right terrible.<br />The vocals are the only thing I feel as if any effort was put into mixing. The vocals are powerful, and well produced while the rest of the band sounds as if they're playing in another room. The guitars lack clarity and do not push at all.<br />The bass somehow lacks low end and is not punchy.<br />The drums are flat with no resonance and the cymbals are tinny.<br /><br />In the past I was impressed with Adams production but this has the sound quality of an unsigned demo tape.<br />Very disappointed with the production of this album.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved the writer's verbage and the way he can make you think about a sentence for minutes. Very well written.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great writing. Details are so perfect.  Characters are so well defined...you clearly get to choose sides, and then you doubt your choice! Loved it!
B005LAIHR2|5.0|It was a gift to a lady who said she loved the movie and this met her expectations...Thank you ,so much
B009R659L8|5.0|Couldn't stop reading. Alway looking forward to a new book by Mary Higgings Clarke. Have read all her books. Getting better and better.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|As an avid reader, I tend to avoid any fiction written after 1960. However a dear friend recommended this book out of the blue and I grudgingly agreed to read it. What a wonderful surprise! Even though it is considered a &#34;youth&#34; book (bit of slightly salty language), it is a well written and finely crafted story. The writer has taken a subject that has been covered quite extensively and chosen an approach to characters that is both novel and clever. (Both adjectives I find sadly lacking in modern literature). Keep the tissue box handy. Definitely worth a read. I couldn't put it down!
B009EANE3M|5.0|Fav Album Fav Band.  I didn't really know who Script was so I bought this CD because it was on sale.  O my.  How much I have missed.  Since this album I have bought all their albums.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|Best Album Yet. Loved Every Song On This Album. You've Done It Again!  Can't Wait For The US Tour To Start.
B002R2B6NE|5.0|Classic thriller in a whole new way.  Don't need blood & guts to scare an audience.  Audrey Hepburn was marvelous in this.  She can play any character.  Good cat and mouse story- some of it a little overdone, but well worth watching a good thriller.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|While there were definitely moments that felt slightly out of place for the series, overall I thought it ended very well.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|I thought this movie rated five stars because in every area - direction, editing, script, setting, character development, pacing, plot - were across the board an excellent effort. The movie builds to a very nice climax and even though you know the Hollywood ending is coming when it does it is deliciously satisfying because these are characters you care about and want to root for.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|You won't agree with everything in this book - but then again that's the beauty of it.  Her stories are deliciously hilarious.  My favorite chapter is the one about her first major breakup.  Great read!!!
B008Y7GSS4|2.0|Cute and Weird at the same time.  Dark humor movie with some funny scenes, some too stupid.  Good acting, but nothing to watch again.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|It was a fun read. Very different to anything else I have read before. I do know a few people who have the disability that Don has. It was great how Graeme Simsion put a different spin on it.
B00005N5S5|5.0|What else can you say.  This movie is one of my favorites and I should have picked it up a long time ago.  Arnold made the terminator character perfect and this movie set it self apart from other films because of him.  Simply a classic.
B003B02O7I|5.0|Loved this book. I could not stop reading. The descriptions of all the characters was great. I loved the trip to Carumba and back. The finally was a great surprise. I never suspected it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Amazing read, heartfelt, real. Real life problems, mental instability, romance in the most unlikely place.<br /><br />Everyone has a shot at a silver lining
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book! Loved it! I liked it better than 50 shaded because its more realistic.. Still waiting on the last one!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I enjoyed reading No Easy Day. It is one of those books that you do not want to put down.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A cast of characters that are anything but run-of-the mill A surprise ending ... well almost a surprise .. and a feel good finale.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Sitting in my living room alone, I actually applauded at the end of the last episode of season 2.  This show is awesome.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|It was a funny movie to watch. The kids even liked it.  I would recommend renting it one night & have a family night.
B002UNMW7O|4.0|It is not BDS 1, but as far as Sequels go... It's an Entertaining Movie. A bit Hinky compared to BDS 1, but<br />needs to be in the Movie collection beside 2 for those days when you just need 2 more hrs of Chaos<br />& Mayhem!!<br />1 Thumb way up!!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I hate that I miss placed my charger and had to pay 18 bucks to get a new one, but at least this time I can connect it to my computer! Great replacement
B005D6442G|5.0|Dexter is good. I like this show a lot. I have every season. I recommend this show and now I'm done.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I could not put this book down! Love love love Enzo and his &#34;art of narration&#34;. Of course this book is about my two favorite things...dogs and Formula One racing. Even if I didn't love Formula One I would have loved this story. Great read for someone wanting a good touching story. Be warned...get out the tissues.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I like all the features on this app. Easy to use just like stand alone kindle. Only draw back is screen is dark.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|Good graphics and love the game play seemed to have some difficulty linking up with correct person in multiplayer this should be simplified and of course needing money to get higher weapons is a real downer but overall good job developers
B0019N8P2W|5.0|fast shipping great DVD's no scratches or skipping I am very happy worn my purchase.  I an happy to see it's THE entire series including it's it fall and is it college
B00AE2I4WK|4.0|Let's be honest here: If you're watching step-up it's not for plot or character development. It's for awesome dance choreography.<br /><br />The plot is a mash-up of the first three, but the dancing is incredible. Who would have guessed it?
B0007TKNL0|4.0|Really enjoyed this edition.  High quality.<br />The Special Features were a different story.  Their segments are boring & lengthy, not entertaining. I did learn, though, that the novel was written by  Gaston Leroux in 1911 & first appeared as a musical in London in 1986.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Great read of information and knowledge of what \\"they\\" Don't teach in school! A read I will do again and pass along to other great minds.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was really good and it was one of those books I actually enjoyed<br />This was just outstanding that's all
1480054542|5.0|Loved this book! I was very excited when I discovered the sibling dynamic between the primary characters. It reminded me of some of my favorite series reads; Nora Roberts McKade Brothers, and Victoria Dahl's Donovan Brothers. I love the depth given to the story by the different types of relationships, not just the romantic element but also the feeling of family that permeats the story.<br />The author also did a wonderful job of setting the scenes, describing the settings in a way that made me feel like I was in that small picturesque town and a part of this lovely little family. I am very excited to read the next books in this series because I now feel like I know these characters and look forward to visiting the town of Pride again. I also must admit that although Iian was not the main character of this particular book, I kinda fell in love with him a little bit and can't wait to read his book!<br />Unfortunately the writing is peppered with the grammatical errors and typos that plaque all Indie authors, but looking past those and enjoying the story that is being told shows that this author has great talent and great potential. Overall I would definitely recommend this book!
B007EECSFA|5.0|I love all of Kate Morton's books. I believe she weaves wonderful stories. Hopefully, not to give anything away, this one is a particular favorite because of the unexpected twists and turns in the narrative.
B008476HBM|5.0|Brushing off my classics, i took to reading Pride and Prejudice again. For someone living in the 21st century and having read all genre for more than 1/2 century, i found the style, the old English, the length of descriptions and dialogues absolutely boring. I liked it though, because the story is revolutionary for a writer of this epoch, and love stories are timeless and poignantly good for most.<br />Better yet was the chance to discover a new author (of my generation and era this time) who endeavored to writing a follow-up on Ms. Austen's great story: \\"Georgiana Darcy's Diary\\" from Anna Elliott. If you have loved \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" you would want to linger in the company of all its characters and read it.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I personally think this game is very fun, because I have over 400 pet shops for real so this makes them even better to play with! :)

B00AQCMK32|5.0|I have few words to describe this game. It is well made and fun to play. Despite this game being fun it does become slightly repetitious one you get so far. On the first play through I made so much money that the game became rather easy however, it remained an extremely entertaining game and I will continue to play this game. Definitely worth the price
B009X011UQ|2.0|I usually like Marware items. I have been looking for a Marware cover for my 8.9 inch Kindle that was comparable to the one I had for my 7 inch Kindle fire and thought this would fit the bill. It is flimsy plastic and if there is an on-off feature, it did not work. I'm sorry I wasted my money.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is just an awesome game. This could be better than Temple Run 2 so you don't had to tilt you phone or tablet left or right to get coins, avoid obstacles or anything. All you had to do is to held it straight.  You know I'll give this 5+ stars.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Because it seems to be more powerful that the other adapters that I have. I would recommend this to anybody that has a kindle.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Have played similar games bit u have to tilt your device which makes gamed arder to play.  I play on a kindle and thid is much more easy to play.

B0091WUZJE|3.0|The searchers is the last in a string of media about the actual kidnapping of a young white girl by Native Americans in Texas. The original account led to Alan Le May's novel, which led to the movie. The movie mostly presents Native American's in a negative, stereotypical manner. The story is also not true to reality, having the now grown woman coming back happily to her family.<br /><br />Best overarching history is Glenn Frankel's recent book, &#34;The Searchers: The Making of an American Legend&#34;, available at Amazon.
0393338398|2.0|I picked it up in airport between flights. I liked the movie so I had some hope the book would be nice as well. I kinda forced my through half the book and finally had to give it up. Just did not catch me on.
0316286850|3.0|This book is a bit out of date. Pictures used in this book are old, however, it's still good to get some basic idea.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|What a wonderful app to listen to to help you relax or to fall asleep. Great relaxing sounds. So many choices. You can mix the sounds and adjust the sound level for each individual sound when you create multi sound mixes. If you pass this one by. You're really missing something.

B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I've seen a lot of movies about mental illness, and Silver Linings Playbook is one of the best. It's not so focused on mental illness that you lose the story, but there is enough focus that you are aware of the struggles of the characters. It's a love story, a story of growth, a story of strength and perseverance... Silver Linings Playbook is one of those &#34;feel good movies&#34; that is wrapped up in more depth than just a &#34;dramedy&#34; or light romance. Not to mention Jennifer Lawrence gives a beautiful performance and Bradley Cooper doesn't fail to succeed in becoming his character. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to spend 2 hours watching a quality movie. There is a scene with nudity in it and there are a couple lines that are fairly vulgar, but it doesn't take away from the story.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Ms.Sandberg highlights the inequities that persist despite the gains that the feminist movement brought forward. She presents highly applicable, reasonable ideas to rectify those inequities. For &#34;career loving parents&#34;, there's a great chapter that addresses the challenge of working towards a leadership position (or being a leader); dispelling the myth of having it all. She peppers the book with heartfelt and witty anecdotes about her experience which provide a great personal dimension to the book. As mentioned in the title, this book is well worth reading for women and men.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was a wonderful character study of two charming challenged people. probably written for young adults, which I am far from.... but I loved the writing style, and the in-depth love and learn story.
B00ABO609A|1.0|so out dated and unrealistic. granted it was an older movie so I guess it was somewhat appropriate for that era.
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|Not opera but still great. Really like the mix of songs and languages. An improvement on Amore. Same team,great sound.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|This one was a real surprise, the disc was better then expected, every song is well picked and the audio quality is excellent. Buy it
B000HNV4GE|3.0|I really like this movie, the accurate portrayal of the classes and how they do not mix (except here).  The biggest mistake that I see is that where the book gives the mind food for imagination of scenes the movie fall short.<br />The character of Scutter (the huntsman's son)is brought in late in the movie and actually only interacts with Maurice during a hunting scene and that is just words.  there is no show of the sexual tension that these tow men have for each other.  Scutter should have been introduced early in the movie and brought into more play with Maurice, still keeping the class distance.  Then at the great moment when they finally embrace each other the release of anxiety would have been better for the audience.<br />As it is Maurice and Scutter talk twice then wide up in bed. My impression to that was Huh? what happened.<br />As I said I like the movie, basically I filled in the blanks in my own mind but I feel that the movie should not have had any blanks.  Look at the deleted scenes and you can glimpse Scutter a few times more then better understand the visual tension between him and Maurice.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I like to play as long as possible but when I run out of diamonds I have to walk away. I refuse to pay. If I don't have more diamonds,  I simply uninstall and go on....
B00BMQDM10|5.0|Sophie Kinsella at her rip roaring best! Hilarious story line and great characters. This book had me laughing out loud and I couldn't put it down.
B000NY12CI|5.0|Haunting and eye opening.  Only gave me thirst for more knowledge! I will recommend it for a couples book club.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|We loved this true story. The acting was superb. The boys broke my heart. I was in tears from beginning to end. We had a similar experience where we live, although on a much smaller scale. However, just as heartbreaking for many in our communityity. In 2012 we had a devastating tornado hit our city. 158 people were killed. My husband and I had to walk though the devastation for hours searching for my Granddaughter.Therefore, I must say we could relate to this family’s feelings of trying to find a loved one in total devastation. Thankfully, the following morning we received information that she was safe.
0307346617|5.0|I love this book. I have been telling everybody I know to read it whether they are into zombies or not. I've never read a book twice, and I just finished my second reading because there aren't any novels out there that can quite scratch this itch for me. I don't know if this helps, but the only other book I've even considered for a second read is Ender's Game.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Wonderful story. I have always wished I would find my family.  That I would belong to someone. Lots of cruel things have been done in the name of religion.
030758836X|4.0|i don't feel the need to give a synopsis of the story since you can read that above or in any of the other reviews. but i will tell you this: this book will not end up being what you think.<br /><br />first of all, a note about some of the other reviews i read saying the book was hard to follow: no, it's not. the author sets up a story from the perspective of each of the two main characters, and if you've been paying attention at all it is very easy to determine which of these characters is speaking. the author does a very good job of giving a distinctive voice to both amy and nick.<br /><br />this dual perspective leads to a very intriguing way to tell the story. the first third of the book had me feeling one way about the characters, and then new plot lines are introduced and i spent the rest of the book not quite sure how i wanted things to turn out. and i guess i'm the kind of reader who likes to be pushed and made to be introspective based on how i react to fictional characters. i like to be excited and unsure when i'm reading a novel. especially one that involves two charactesr like amy and nick. again, i really don't want to give anything away, but these are two people that will leave you unsure: pity, sorrow, anger, regret..a mixture of all the above?<br /><br />one thing i will agree on: the ending was kind of limp. a bit open, but not enough to leave you thinking a sequel was in order. hence the 4 stars.<br /><br />give it a chance. i read the book in 3 days. at the very least, it keeps you going to see exactly how it will all blow up.
B00BF11STU|5.0|This movie was great. So enlightening. It goes to show you that you cannot just go by what the media reports.
B00000I14Z|5.0|Charles Mingus recorded his masterpiece in 1959. Since the first track, you are inmediately conveyed to the very core of the jazz. Pieces such as Goodbye pork hat, Pussy cat blues, Fables of Faubus, better git in your soul or open letter to Duke reveal a world apart.<br /><br />You must have this CD far beyond all the reviews you read. Don't leave it aside by any reason.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great adaptation but it doesn't follow the book 100%. Characters are well written and acted and the effects only enhance the story.
B000VEA38E|5.0|what can i say the cd and box came in awesome condition and sounds great and brings everything a poster stickers and great music from episodes 4 thru 6 and the bonus cd is great as well..the most complete box set, any star wars fan should get

B00ARA4SLU|2.0|Surprised that 2 wonderful actors would make such a terrible movie.  Now I know why it didn't last in the theaters.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. It's very addicting. A new twist on a classic game. I would recommend to a friend.

B00CAJDUX8|1.0|This album contains a so-so remix of the dance track Rebound by Arty and Mat Zo but I'm only giving it 1 star because its incorrectly titled as &#34;Let's Go&#34; instead of &#34;Rebound Remix (originally by Arty and Mat Zo) and I thought I was getting original music.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|the dvd was in good shape thank you. I will finish my collection with season 5 soon, thank you very much
0307346617|5.0|I loved this book.  It was very descriptive and you could totally picture yourself in the conundrum that the book described so well!!  I cannot wait for the movie to come out.
B00AHXDECG|3.0|I think I got caught up in Bruno fever.  After buying the Doo Wops which i enjoy almost every song, I bought this album without fully listeneing to all the recoredings.  i wish I had as I could have saved money buying 3 or 4 songs rather  than a whole album that bores me.
1451695195|5.0|Wonderful read, enjoyed reading about the subject.  The doctor suffered a terrible ailment that brought him to the brink.  His faith is what we should all strive for.
B000I8G5B2|5.0|There are plenty of reviews here so I will simply add that this movie has stayed with me.  I think about it from time to time and remember well the emotional and spiritual impact it has had.  I guess people just see things differently, but for me this movie was pure power.  It's heart baby.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|This movie was great, The quality of the disc was excellent, no skips, hardly any wear on disc, overall happy with this!
B0079R8KO0|5.0|I was not expecting something that was economical and would be durable and practical at the same time.  This cover works great.  When closed it protects the fire and when open you can position as needed.  It is not the best if you are planning to use the incline for typing as a light touch works okay.  But if you are a heavy touch person like myself you may find it scooting away.
0316067598|5.0|a very through account of the actions of seal team 10, and operation redwing. I enjoyed the book very much.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Cloud Atlas will be loathed by many and hailed as a masterpiece by just as many others.  It's a complex film dealing with lots of ideas, characters, stories, and emotions.  It's brutal, violent, and disturbing while at the same time filled with love, beauty, and hope for mankind.  Yes, there is nudity, cannibalism, graphic violence, homosexual relationships, racism, and it's three hours long, and if these things bother you, you may not enjoy this film.<br /><br />I, however, adore Cloud Atlas.  I actually saw it six times in the theater. It had such a profound impact on me.  It's one of the most important movies of the past twenty years, yet it may take another twenty years for this movie to be considered the classic it deserves to be recognized as. It's nonlinear and avant-garde on one hand while being a basic anthology film with six simple stories told at the same time on the other hand.  This is a hard film to really explain to someone who has not seen it.  If you watch the first thirty minutes, the setup of the six stories, and are not turned off by the multiple story line experience you will probably enjoy the film.  If you are completely bored by the first thirty minutes it will only get more and more confusing, hard to follow and most likely irritating.  There is also a future language in the final story that will annoy and infuriate many people who claim it makes no sense.  I won't deny, it's tough at first to follow but with a bit of patience you learn to understand it and after repeat viewings you can understand a good 90-95% of it.<br /><br />There are so many things I love about Cloud Atlas.  It's art filled with big ideas and grand ambition but it's not always meant to be understood or perfect either.  The editing style is nothing short of amazing.  The film is edited by themes and feelings as much as driven by plot.  Often the editing is quick, jumping between stories in matters of seconds as we watch multiple characters through out time going throughsimilar experiences or having grand epiphanies that transcend time and space. People looking to find linear connections between the stories will often be grasping at straws because you are meant to feel the connections (as opposed to viewing literal connections) between the six stories as one watches it.  The entire point of this film is how humans are connected by themes of love/hate, good/evil, kindness/cruelty, freedom/oppression, courage/fear, and how we always have been and always will be ruled by these emotions through out human history.  The fact that each story is told in a different time period and genre is one of the many ways this film tries to reinforce it's message.  Many people will be quick to interpret this film as a story of reincarnation, however I do not think that is exactly what the film is about.  It's meant to be left open and ambiguous much like the final act of Kubrick's 2001.  Cloud Atlas is also a very well made movie full of beautiful imagery, stunning effects, great acting, and one of the few times I can remember in recent years where you feel like all who were involved in making this film were trying to tell a story they really loved and believed in, in their own way and by their own terms.  In a day and age when all entertainment feels like it's been focus grouped to death and sold as a product to the widest audience possible, it's a breath of fresh to see film makers reach for the stars and try something different. While they know full and well they will alienate certain viewers with their artistic vision.<br /><br />Now, it's not 100% perfect.  One or two of the makeup jobs are a bit strange and there are a few corny lines of dialogue, which almost seem to give a bit of needed camp in a sometimes intense viewing experience.  I keep seeing this listed as a science fiction but it's also not strictly a science fiction film any more than it's a period costume drama, a slapstick comedy, a detective story, or a post apocalyptic adventure.It's all movies you have ever seen and nothing like you've ever seen.

B009AMANBA|4.0|This was an excellent film.  It highlighted a period of our history we do not always need to be proud of...slavery, and the civil war.  We can however salute Lincoln for wanted to make all men equal, as is declared in our Constitution.  It is sad that he had to pay with his life for correcting that injustice.

But I finally bought it. Other than the 3 track that I hate! I love just about the whole album, with a big personal preference for Animals because of the 5 beats rhythm.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|It is not for the faint of heart and has some very disturbing scenes but I was kept on the edge of my seat.  There were so many twists and turns I couldn't wait for the next episode.  I have always loved Kevin Bacon and he was what drew me to the series.

B007RCJNDE|4.0|I have given a 4 star rating because I did not think it was a Great read, something was missing and of course the fact that<br />the series is now concluded creates a bit of a downer. The Wheel of Time series has been a part of my life for so many years<br />I will miss the annual indulgence.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I have been reading this series for years as I would guess a majority of those that purchased this book recently have. Kudo's to Brandon Sanderson for finishing the series with more action and active plot lines than some of the books written by Jordan in the middle of the story line. How often do you need to visualize Nynaeve tugging on her braid? Great that her hair was too short to revisit that statement in this book. While the outcome was foreshadowed, the multiple twists and possibilities presented by Brandon kept the pages turning with delightful doubt of the finale.
B000JML7YC|5.0|Easily the best thing about Northanger Abbey is the slick, satirical humor with which Austen portrays her characters; all of whom are recognizable in our own lives. From Isabella, living in an ever-changing truth of her own creation, to our dear heroine Catherine, so genuine she cannot comprehend how others could be anything but, we are drawn into a world of parties and personalities and learn the dangers of a wild imagination. At once a light-hearted, young romance and a cutting look at society, Northanger Abbey is a must for any reader.

0451232852|2.0|This book is a great way to learn about early 20th-century history. It's a little predictable and melodramatic, but engaging. The main problem is the ridiculous soft porn love scenes. They are glaringly out of place and turn what could have been well-written work into Harlequin Romance trash.

B008RZ96RS|5.0|One of the most important and influential albums of the 20th century has finally gotten the treatment it deserves. We have had the stereo version forever, and the mono version has been out for a few years, but now we finally have the Dolph Spectre sessions. And what's more, about half those sessions are sourced from tape, rather than that acetate some dude bought at an auction and tried to sell to Polygram. (The others are from acetate, probably that one), but all to say the sound quality is much better than what has been on the internet. It is exciting to hear Lou sing &#34;Heroin&#34; from the Spectre sessions with the opening line &#34;I know just where I'm going&#34; instead of &#34;I don't know just where I'm going.&#34; It changes the whole meaning of the song, making it even more harrowing.<br /><br />The packaging is beautiful, but I don't fall for pretty packages. If you don't have to pay too much, this is a must-have.
B00571F26Y|5.0|read this and then try it for a month! you will notice a big change. its going to be a big change!!,  and some wont like to watch for gluten and purchase the &#34;good grains&#34;, but when or if you ever go back to wheat, by choice or by hidden gluten(its in everything it seems) you may feel ill. i did and stay far from wheat/gluten as i can. no more digestive issues, clarity of cognition,memory improved, waist smaller( i didn't need weight loss) health improvement all around.  I grew up on a farm in northern illinois and grew all the major crops, wheat wasn't what is it has become with the genetic code altered for bumper crops. I  bought this book on kindle and recommend it to one and all for many reasons, as a consumer its not easy to split the atom, but this book lays it out for peeps like me

B007GCY8FS|2.0|Good story but Reacher is not himself in this one. He takes a back seat for most of the story and is not directly involved in solving the issue.<br /><br />The action is limited, slow and weighed down with description and only comes into play in the third act. I don't think he even punches anyone, all gun work.<br /><br />Lee phoned this one in folks. Sorry.

B0012FHGCW|5.0|I would give this six stars, if it let me.  But since five is the most, that is what I am giving.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The author had a clever idea, but none of it rang true.  Are police really that stupid?  Does the medical community ignore donor rights?  The ending was very contrived and read like she wanted to write a movie script for a Lifetime movie - complete with the opportunity for a sequel.  I would not bother to read this book, nor another book by the author.

0385742886|5.0|This book was probably my favorite out of all four in the series. The Kill Order takes you into a whole new world. Just when you think it couldn't get any better Mark and Trina take the stage, leaving their audience in awe. This prequel gives an amazing background story describing what happened before the Maze was even created in The Maze Runner. I didn't believe I would enjoy the book when I realized it began with entirely new characters, but the second the reader gets into the third chapter, he/she will begin to develop a love for these new characters. James Dashner does a wonderful job in taking the readers away from reality and dropping them into a completely new apocalyptic, dystopian society. He does an amazing job of creating an entirely new post-apocalypse world that invokes new feelings in the reader. The scheme of this story is just as riveting as his previous books. With \\"cranks\\", \\"immunies\\", and the ones just struggling to stay disease free, the reader becomes overtaken and is dragged into this story.<br /> This book is a page-turner. James Dashner has always had a way of ending each chapter with a cliffhanger, making it almost impossible to put the book down. When I stopped reading, I felt deprived. It is one of those books that you can't continue on with your day without finding out what happens next. James Dashner does an amazing job of making everything feel real. When you are reading, you feel the emotion and fear he creates in his new characters. He also makes it very easy to visualize each character. Dashner practically paints a picture with words, making his book almost seem real. The amount of detail that he puts into his descriptions makes the readers feel like they could be standing in Mark's shoes.<br />This book is perfect for the teenage generation because of how well Dashner writes. The entire book flows perfectly. It is written in black and white, leaving no fuzzy gray areas where a person may feel they need to go back and reread something that just happened. A down side to this is that it is easy to read too fast, thus ending this awe inspiring series much quicker than one may like. When I finished this last book, I became extremely upset that this was the last book of the series. After reading all four books, I became so attached to this new world as a sat and rooted for the survival of all of my favorite characters. It's a shame that there are no books left. But on a brighter note, I would recommend this series to anybody. The Maze Runner series is by far the best series I have ever read. It simply blows the Harry Potter and Twilight series out of the water. This series is incomparable and simply breathtaking.

B00C4YZ12C|5.0|A Galaga-Galaxian style shoot-em-up game, but modernized.  The game play and control is excellent (try \\"direct-control\\")and the neon like graphics just add to the experience.  If you want to see more reviews check out those on Google Play or go to the dev's website [...]  This shooter is very well done, very playable and certainly worth the 1.99!  Good job John!  I hope you sell a lot of copies.

B007ZSBQYE|2.0|Tried to play several times.Quality on screen seemed nice to the eyes but the game itself was difficult to play, not because of any skill level but because the game is only as receptive as the screen is on my phone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun for all ages. My elementary school aged kids introduced me to this game and we are all hooked. We recommend it!
B009CGAUW6|4.0|Love this game. Used to play it in my friend's basement. This was the original version with used a much bigger board and the monster and treasure cards were placed right on the little rooms on the board. Yes, it took forever to setup, and yes, it was a constant battle to keep everyone from accidentally shifting the board and all the pieces, but after the setup you could really get into the game.<br /><br />The new version uses little cardboard punch-out markers to represent pretty much everything in the game, including which rooms have been visited, where loot has been dropped after a lost battle, etc.. Dealing with these markers adds a significant amount of time to each turn, and they are super-easy to forget. Even after playing a few times it feels like every turn has an \\"accounting\\" phase. Oh yeah, and good luck trying not to lose markers.<br /><br />That being said, it's a pretty fun dungeon crawl and I can play with my 9- and 11-year-old daughters without them getting bored in an hour or two.
B00CATSONE|4.0|A very inspiring book indeed. It does actually remind me on the importance of imagination and giving me the courage to imagine. Nikola Tesla is one of the greatest man who should have been given more credits and recognition by the public.

B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|this was an accidental purchase.  I was pleasantly surprised when it held my attention and provided hours of entertainment.  I generally do not review apps but with the offer of free sequel from the developer I could not resist.<br />for a couple bucks it was well worth it.<br />the only down side was not enough continual story line.  it was kind of lacking but again hours of entertainment<br />graphics we're ok.  nothing to write home about.  hints were plentiful &amp; seemed to reset quick enough not to leave me frustrated
B004AO1FF6|4.0|It dragged a bit in the middle, so I wouldn't give it five stars, but the end was pretty good, integrating all the companions.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book really drives home the point of how our military have so many regulations that doing their jobs are handicapped.  It also helps explain why the FBI could not investigate the Boston bombers more thoroughly.

B0060D123K|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite Christmas movies. The only disappointment is that they cut out the song that Scrooge's girlfriends sings in the park when they breakup—that song really helped develop Scrooge's character and the melody is the theme of the ending song, which ties it together very nicely. I wish it hadn't been cut out. (I think it was cut out in the widescreen version.)

0307276902|4.0|I recently read the book A Million Little Pieces  by James Frey. This story was an autobiography about the authors rough life battling addiction. It touches on the difficult journey to sobriety and all the challenges that come about. The main Characters in this book were the author James and a woman who comes into the book a little later on named Lily. James is really a self pitying loner throughout most of this book, until his family starts to come visit him and he opens up a bit more. When he meets lily there is something different about her. Even though they aren't technically allowed to talk to each other, James and Lily become really good friends and they start to fall for each other. They both however face their own issues throughout the book. James's real struggle is the entire first half of the book. He was all alone, he had to have various surgeries without painkillers, he got sick everyday from withdrawal, debated leaving and had the worst attitude towards getting better and towards other people in the organization.  Lily on the other hand, had different problems. Her problems surrounding her drug addiction were similar to James, but her social hurdles were almost non existent. Her family visited her every week, she had plenty of friends at the facility and she was open instead of being guarded all the time. I don't think I had a favorite character however. I liked the concept of James but the entire first half of the book was him just milling around depressed and angry at everyone and everything.  He really just needed to get over himself and deal with the fact that he had issues just like everyone else in the center. That even though he may have had more hard core issues than others he didn't suffer any more than anyone else in the long run.<br /> I believe that many people could relate to this book. Whether or not you are dealing with addiction or previously have you could relate. Or maybe if you have someone in your family that struggled with addiction, or even just the people around you. Its a book that really hits home for some people, while others it may just be strictly informative. However, reading other reviews by people that have read this book, it has come to my knowledge that these accounts are not 100% accurate. Some of the methods that are used in this book would never work in real life or the opposite. Some of the methods they use in real life are put down in this book. James even goes as far as saying that the 12 step program is bull s***t. Many People could relate to James's personality though. He is very reserved and keeps to himself. He has trouble letting his walls down and opening up to people. A lot of people may not realize that they posses some of these traits but they  find themselves recognizing a bit of themselves within this text. I don't know if these characters actions are believable, because I have never known any hardcore drug addicts and alcoholics.  I do think that they would act in a way similar to how James acts.<br /> I haven't decided yet whether or not I enjoyed this book. I liked how it wasn't written in a traditional style, but it sometimes almost seemed as if he couldn't write. By far one of the most disappointing factors of this book was that a lot of the details are fabricated. While James Frey was an alcoholic and a drug addict, this book is not a completely true story about his life. I guess thats one of the things that I would want to change about it. If it were totally true it would make the book seem more real than it did looking back on it. My favorite part of the book was when James was plotting to kill himself and he wrote his own obituary. This really shed a light on his past and what it was really like. In fact thats another thing I would like to change about the book. I would have liked there to be more of a back story about his life before rehab. I mean I understood that he was detached from his family for many years but I would have liked to know how they became so distant.<br /> I would recommend the book to someone else. However you would have to like books with a lot of drama and with a dark twist to them. This book contained a lot graphic details too, you have to be able to deal with the descriptions within the book. The language in this book got pretty intense sometimes and I would not recommend it to anyone below the high school age. Many of the scenes and ideas are very mature concepts as well.  Be aware though, that like I said this book isn't 100% true and the facts are not all completely true to the situation. Overall it was an ok read but the fact that it wasn't real was very disappointing and a massive let down.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|cast is excellent:  Jamie Fox, Christoph Waltz, Leo Dicaprio, Samuel L. Jackson.  There is also a part for Walton Goggins who plays  Boyd Crowder on Justified.  BTW--Christoph Waltz is a superstar actor in his prime--he scares you in the first five minutes of inglorious bastards by showing you the brutality of Nazi regime-- but you empathize with him in this movie--where he is guided by his conscious--very versatile actor.<br /><br />Movie is vintage Quentin Tarantino--excellent dialog, plot, and movie flows great for most part--except it seems to drag on just a little too much and then the end feels crammed down a bit.<br /><br />There is something else--that is not related to Tarantino or the actors--but more of present circumstances.  The movie has lots of shooting scenes and violence--not a big deal for me usually--but for some reason i cringed a bit when i saw it--probably because of all the dreadful shootings on the news or maybe i'm just getting old and cruddy.  There's also lots of use of the N word--this didn't bother me, but it may offend others.  So--if you are a parent--you may want to skip this movie for the younger kids.<br /><br />Finally, I gave it 3 stars not because its a bad movie--but because its no Pulp Fiction--which in my opinion is Tarantino's best work.  (Probably one of top 5 movies I have ever seen.)  So I guess I am measuring Tarantino to himself.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading Lean In, and felt that Sheryl Sandberg willingly shared her mistakes and triumphs. While there are a few opinions of hers that I did not agree with, I found more often than not, that the book gave me pause to reflect on my own career to find those times when I allowed the dominant mindset to direct my actions, even when I knew better. This book should be read by women and men alike, across the generations. Indeed, as Sheryl says, if we are going to change the culture of business and society, we need more women leaders and more men who support them.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I have read everything that Michael Connelly has written and tore through most of it because I couldn't put it down.  This book never captured me.  I would go days without reading a page.

B000LTAY1U|5.0|Pros: Price, looks, see through back cover<br /><br />Cons: All automatics are a little fast or a little slow so understand you maybe have to adjust the time every few weeks.<br /><br />I'm a budding watch collector.  Up until this point I have only purchased quartz movement watches but wanted to try out an automatic.  I own other Seiko dress watches so I was familiar with their quality and this watch also didn't disappoint. It quickly became my daily wearer.  I love how much smoother the ticking action is compared to my other watches.  I'm looking forward to years of good looks and solid operation.
B0070DOHQS|1.0|It moves the mouse just fine, no lag. But you can not tell what the screen looks like in the slightest bit. its just all scrambled, i assumed maybe it was the definition of my desktop background, so i replaced it with an all black background and still nothing. After that epic fail i thought maybe it was the settings in the app, so i tried every option one by one, no different. I then checked the options in jump desktop, nothing.. I'm going to have to say teamviewer is the best choice i can find so far to do this with, it works so much better and its free. i had a lot of hope for this app, maybe one day in the future they can get it working for my device, maybe not. 1 star for now.

0451228731|2.0|This book was entertaining in a Zoolander sort of way, once you got past the cut & pastes from the instruction manuals of wireless routers and the fact that every male character fell in to one of three cliched personality cut-outs (a. military good guy, b. civilian/police good guy, c. generalized bad guy).<br /><br />In this book the \\"good guys\\" are incredibly stupid and get killed off like flies, and absolutely every last thing goes perfectly right for the evil bad guys, who you can't help but end up rooting for by the end.<br /><br />The plot went something like this:<br /><br />Dr Evil:  I am the now-dead puppet master and have planned the grisly deaths of everyone who doesn't like my computer games and/or prove themselves to be as e-ville as I am!  Muahahahahaa<br /><br />Regular bad guy: I guess I need to prove I'm the evil son you never had in the first three chapters by killing my business associates and date raping some random girl so you'll posthumously adopt me and let me beta-test custom all-seeing contact lenses...<br /><br />Military good guy: I'd like to take this moment to loudly and portentously underestimate the undead evil genius and brag about the distinguished service records of all of my men before putting their lives on the line!  I'm sure it will all be fine.<br /><br />Police good guy: For some reason I continuously \\"can't understand\\" computers, so can whoever is the triple agent please spout pages of expository dialog and give a cop a break? By the way, you're all jerks and criminals. Except the creepy S&M lady, who I'm not suspicious of at all.<br /><br />Sole Female Character: I'm a woman of color in a position of power for three pages!<br /><br />Military good guy: Okay people - listen up! Although most of us have gotten slaughtered by double agents that have infiltrated every level of our organization, I will still blindly trust all of you with my life and the lives of the rest of my men! C'mon! Let's g-----<br /><br />Bad guy : Sigh. It's getting boring to spend ten pages detailing exactly which way your blood splatters.<br /><br />Sole Female Character: We've been infiltrated! Quick, someone get me a completely unsecured phone line so I can state both of my parents' names and addresses, and urge the feds to take them to a secure location which I will also reveal!<br /><br />Good guy: I think there's still room in this story for me to make ineffectual threats and then attempt to defeat the forces of evil with the use of a doorknob lock, right guys? They might have overthrown the government and our security system, but I bet they can't get past a locked door! Who's with me!?<br /><br />All the other good guys: Dude, don't forget to stand back where you can't see him and give him no less than 15 chances to put his hands up while he activates evil machinery under the desk, and then say \\"you're under arrest!\\" seconds before he kills you.<br /><br />Dr. Evil: Remember that time I spent 20 years of my life pre-recording moralistic lectures to people who may or may not ever hear them? In case I became an evil dead guy? TOTALLY worked.

B0091REZMW|4.0|Great game overall. Would have given it five stars if I could figure out how to get past the golden bullet in the hunting room without using up all of my diamonds! Help someone.....
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This is a great movie if you like Star Trek you will love this one.  Most of the people chosen to play the original characters are very good, but the very best one is Bones, the doctor.  The actor who portrays Bones is spot on.  He really has studied the character as originally played by DeForest Kelly.  He has his walk, talk, mannerisms and inflections down pat and he looks a lot like Mr. Kelly too.  Then there is Spock who is also great.  He really looks like Spock and acts the part well.  I could go on and on about the cast, but you should see this yourself.  It is terrific and I can't wait for the next one, &#34;Into the Darkness.&#34;
B0016KJKIG|5.0|just do it. the molle sheath it comes with sucks. it does its job, but it sucks at everything else. this one rocks out loud. and yes, it has the little place on the sides to hold your accessories
B000J159N8|4.0|Good movie, good story line, Terrible time in History.  So much more happened to our Men and Women in uniform.  Kudos to them.
B00123LIPK|5.0|This collection reminds me just why Madonna has been so defining in the pop music landscape.  It has most of Madonna's essential tracks.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Very boring but it did have great graphics. I got the free version and it just keeps asking for money
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I've been waiting for the return of Hannibal and this show is it. Watching it ad free on Amazon is a real plus. Our local TV station might of cut parts of the show to stack in ads which made the story hard to follow, but on Amazon you can watch the whole thing without ads when you want to.
B009FZHYKU|2.0|its like the plot to no where, its a soap opera with dwindling special effects and lame character ( and poorly written ) studies
B003XE1CU2|5.0|The title says it all.  True to size, fits good!  Good shoe to stand/work in all day!! Good price for brand!!!

B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Awesome story line! Fabulous characters. Maggie Smith steals the show! Just a great cast of actors and not a lot of gratuitous sex
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|THIS BOOK HELD MY INTEREST UNTIL THE VERY END.  IT EVOKED SUCH SYMPATHY FOR JAMIE AS I ENVISIONED HIM AS BOTH A CHILD AND AN ADULT.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|A bit creepy, a little humor, and the filming style used is just a bit different than most tv dramas. Love watching via amazon prime!
B00AB7HESI|3.0|this game is soooooo fun... I play for hours (if I have time) but this game took like 3 days to install on my kindle. then, I finally found out that I had to remove some apps from my device sonit would load. besides that... ITS AWESOME
B006MW3V6U|4.0|This is such a good mini series! I recommend it to every one..I never tire of the cast...Can't wait for the next show!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I had been hunting high and low for a mouse to replace my Logitech mx518 which I have been very happy with.  I thought it time to have more than 1800 dpi available for gaming.  Many of the products I found were limited, and some required sharing private information in order to access software.<br /><br />I took a chance on this unknown maker, and I have been pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The mouse has a solid build, braided cabling and LED light you can change the color of. It remains on while the PC is on. You can adjust the weight if you like but found I didn't need it.  It is a bit larger than the mx518. My hands are average size and it fits neatly in my palm and my fingers easily reach all buttons.  It is not ambidextrous: you will need to use your right hand.<br /><br />All buttons can be customized via the software.  I found this really easy to use.  There are 9 buttons, three of which are within easy reach of the right thumb. You can adjust polling and dpi. It polls from 125 hz to 1000. Dpi ranges from 200 to 8K.  You can create four dpi settings and adjust them on the fly. You can create two profiles and either assign a button to on the fly changes or hit the switch embedded in the mouse bottom.  I find one profile suits me. This is also a macro mouse but I'm not using that feature and will leave that to another reviewer.<br /><br />In game I found it difficult to turn 360 with all the weights on board.  I think I used them to adjust to the dpi increase.  They are out now and movement is much easier.  I notice a major increase in speed and accuracy over the mx518.<br /><br />So far I'm very satisfied and pleasantly surprised.  At this point I would highly recommend this mouse to anyone who likes the flexibility of assigning tasks to buttons and making multiple adjustments to suit.  It is an extremely adjustable and easy to use product.<br /><br />Well done Anker!
B000002J0B|5.0|Favorite Led  Zepplin  album of all time.  Too many great songs to mention all of them here. Totally enjoying the CD.
B0040JHWKS|5.0|For over 30 years, these songs were hidden to the public, at least for the most part.  These songs are gems for sure!

B00B7FOQCK|5.0|This hub has been working fine for me. I typically use it for two USB 3 portable hard drives that get their power from the USB port--with both plugged in at the same time. I haven't had any problems yet, after about a month.<br /><br />There was a warning in the paperwork NOT to use the hub for power-hungry devices; but the hard drives chug along with no problems. I used it once, with the two hard drives and a portable Blu-ray writer all at the same time with no problem. I couldn't feel that the hub heated up at all, either.<br /><br />It's tiny, fast and inexpensive.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag has a pocket for every piece of camera gear and more.  The padding is good and the bag is a comfortable fit.  Plenty of space.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A coworker who races cars on the weekend asked me the other day what my hobby was. I replied that I loved to read. He told me to read The Art or Racing in the Rain because it was one of the few booms he has actually read. I must say it is a great book from start to finish. Even if your not into race car driving it has some great life lessons that everyone can use. I would recommend this book to anyone. It's also nice to read from a dog's perspective.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Love it then lost it. I think my housekeeper stole it. When I used it, it worked just fine. okay.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I waited over a year for it's release. I was not disappointed. This is defiantly not the last of the Clifton's.
B004ZNA7WY|5.0|Pink Floyd is my favorite band in the world. This was the only album I didn't have on CD yet.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great historical based film with added drama and great acting. Never was bored with story as I can sometimes get. I definitely recommend it.
B005LW5J9O|4.0|First read this as a traditional book (library loan) when it first was out and loved it. Fascinating narrative, delightful connections between one time and place and another, all clearly linked to main story of the book searcher's find. Recently, my book club read this so I reread it, or tried to, on my Kindle Touch. By chapter 3 I kept getting kicked from current page to end notes, with much difficulty finding my way back to the page I was on. The result was that I had to reread (scan) several of the same passages over and over but had a hard time progressing. The book's organization then started seeming random to me. I read reviews that called it &#34;disjointed,&#34; and I agreed, but maybe both the reviews and I were suffering from Kindleitis.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Where do I begin?  I had seen the play two years ago without having known anything about the story (which is how I wanted it to be), and was instantly sucked in.  I heard talk of a movie and knew that I had to see it.  I wanted to read the book, but was put off by its length!  After seeing the movie, I decided enough was enough, and I got this edition for the Kindle.  I'm sure there are better translations out there but the price was right....  I found quite a number of errors along the way, but with it being so long, they were quite spread out!  Haha!  This is an amazing book, and I'm glad that I waited till I was older till reading it, for it takes a matured mind to appreciate this kind of piece!  This book is not for the casual reader (to put it lightly), and is most certainly not a quick read!  It was life changing for me, and will be for those who are smart enough to appreciate it's genius.  Many life lessons, and many facts of life that are unfortunately still true today!  I cannot say enough good things about this book!  I will admit that there are a several times where you might want to throw in the towel (scenes describing the past, Paris and things that while related don't really add much to the story), but just feel free to skim these parts or avoid them altogether if you would just like to get back to the dialogue and action .....  Most avoid fans will say this is a horrible tip, but I say no because for me I was interested in the story more than the history of Napoleon, for example!  It takes some time (or not much time at all if you stay up late and read like I did), but once you have gotten to the last page, you will feel a sense of accomplishment!  This version is probably not much different than the\\"paying\\" ones only maybe not as many translation or grammatical errors....  If that kind of thing bothers you then go ahead and get another version.  Other than that, happy reading and if you haven't seen the movie or listened to the soundtrack then get to it and enjoy!
B00AQO1VYY|4.0|I loved hearing these songs again and listening to the extra tracks included in the Deluxe edition as well as the added DVD. It's incredible to see Layne Staley performing again and hearing him on the live CD. I would have given this item 5 stars but the CD with the original and added tracks was defective - irritating background clicking sound on a few of the songs which detracted from the material itself. I returned it once asking for another copy, which I received, but to no avail. Same irritating defections. Out of pure frustration, I downloaded the 2 CD's off of ITunes which sounds so much better.  I did keep the 2nd defective version I received from Amazon after returning the original defective version solely for the purpose of having the live DVD. Anyway, buyer beware!
B000001E77|3.0|Mr. Dynamite (JB) shows up for about half of this item.  There are some gems on here; however, most of the recycled tunes are boring.  The only updated junk that's at all interesting include \\"When the Saints...,\\" and \\"These Foolish Things.\\"  Others bring down the quality of this originally four sided LP, especially \\"Please,Please,Please, which is ridiculous (IMO).  Great highlights on this disk (all-time) include \\"Cold-Blooded,\\" with it's cool bridge and switch,  \\"Can't Stand It,'76,\\" which is a wild funkfest, and \\"Papa Don't Take No Mess,\\" a solid groove which took up all of Side 4 on the groove.  These are outstanding JB efforts, and it's a shame to have them intermixed with limp updates of old ballads, etc.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|It was a great game. Just wish it was longer. It was only 8 chapters long. It worked well on the phone and I kind of want to play some more games, just not sure if $3 is worth a couple hours of play.
B003NTMREM|1.0|This TV series is definitely not for teens and contains very suggestive material.  In addition it innocently throws controversial subject matter in your face under the impression of a good sci-fi show.
B009R659L8|5.0|As always, Mary Higgins Clark delivers an amazing book. I'm only sorry I've finished it already.  Lots of characters to keep you guessing \\"who done it?\\"
B00821PCJS|4.0|Fans of Sci-Fi should give this show a try.  It is an old concept (alien-invasion) but the characters and plotline breath new life into it.  You have to overlook a bit of amateur fx, but they are not a deal breaker.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It is such a handy way to check the weather.  We are constantly going to boys sporting events and is allows me to know what to expect and to prepare for whatever they may encounter.

B0091REZMW|3.0|pretty good game needs a better tutorial but good game if u spend the time to figure it out seems to have a pretty strong following
B008JFUO4U|2.0|I am amazed at all of the reviews here which imply that Oblivion had innovative plot twists when it clearly contained elements from other sci fi films.  They must be oblivious to the fact that the Matrix, Moon, and Independance Day all had very similar plot developments to this film.
B008L1DNGI|3.0|My grandson like my kindle and found this game.  He likes it, he is four!<br />I am not so sure about it as a game I like.  I like more word games, jewel games etc...
0142421375|5.0|We purchased my son this John Grisham novel to see if he would enjoy the story.  He has read all three stories and cannot wait for the next story.  Thank you John for giving our son such a wonderful story to read.
0553801473|5.0|I began reading Game of Thrones when it first came out and Dance with Dragons is a great as the other books.  The best parts were of course with Tyrion, the story line with him kept changing and I could not wait for the next change.  Reek was a close second for story line.  Can’t wait to find out what happens with him and if he gets revenge (but let’s not forget he is still a dirt bag for what he did).  John and the Wall got tedious but still good.  Daenery’s was boring and I just wanted to read thru it to get it over with.  The end of her story line got good but the first 90% of her story was boring, nothing happens.<br /><br />So my review would be Tyrion and Reek are the best, them alone are worth reading the book.  The small part with Cersei is great and there are some other small story lines. But John and Daenery’s you just need to read thru without being bored to sleep.
B000001F75|5.0|Following two tepid releases between 1971 and 1972, Thin Lizzy recorded a masterful atmospheric take of Whiskey In The Jar that actually became a hit throughout Europe. With a hint of commercial success on their hands, they were given the green light to make their \\"breakthrough\\" album from Decca who had a lot of faith in them at the time. Of course this record still didn't make the band big stars, but it's actually one of their best albums ever. On the debut TL (still a 3 piece with Eric Bell on guitar) had hinted at the funky gritter rock, and softer folk ballad style songs. Shades Of A Blue Orphanage was a very laid back record, almost all ballads, or more reflective type songs. Its the biggest misstep in the catalog. But on Vagabonds, Phil really combined all those styles and matured them to really make their best record of the \\"early period\\" and for the \\"popular\\" period too.<br /><br />Opening with Mama Nature Said, there's some good slide guitar work from Bell, and an overall good bouncy slightly country-ish rock feel, it's probably one of the funnest combinations of country with hard rock. The expanded energy is noticed right away here. The Hero & the Madman is a little more adventurous. The band had hinted at these more prog like concepts on the first 2 albums but they really fine tuned into something here. This one has an interesting spoken intro from esteemed BBC dj David 'Kid' Jensen, who loved the band as well as other burgeoning British rock acts like Budgie. It tramples along for about 6 minutes, has some good guitar work and a semi-epic feel, almost like a garage band attempting a prog track. Slow Blues is one of the weaker cuts here, being a little dated, it still has a good guitar groove and kinda sounds like an early blues period Fleetwood Mac tune. The only problem is it does lose the energy and drive the first 2 tracks established. However, they must've been paying attention to album thematics because they follow it up with one of TL's most burning songs ever, The Rocker. This aside from Whiskey, is the only track from the bands pre Robertson/Gorham era that most people know or was still done at their live shows and regularly appears on compilations. Phil really establishes that tough guy swagger he would perfect during the Jailbreak/Bad Reputation era. The song drips with energy and attitude with some great fiery guitar work from Bell, who was a very underrated player. This tune is what rock n roll is all about. The band gets serious with the title track, opening with Brian Downey's rhythmic drum work, and some traditional irish chant from Lynott, it morphs into a really ripping rocker with a rolling groove on the verse countered by a real anthem chorus. Wah-wah guitar work throughout, it's first rate TL here, the song has an epic feel to it, and really demonstrates this band really is one of the greatest hard rock/heavy metal bands ever. This has to be the albums centerpiece material here because they follow it up with the beautiful ballad Little Girl In Bloom. A minimalistic but emotionally resonant ringing bass line, some heartfelt and poetic lyrics and singing from Lynott (his trademark), topped off with some beautifully restrained guitar work, it's a sin this song isn't more recognized. Gonna Creep Up On You also excels on the 3rd select style TL had been dabbling in at the time. The funk-rocker. There was a lot of this on the debut, and it was cool but this one really cooks, some slinky guitar work and good flashy drum work from Downey. A Song While I'm Away might be a little too uptempo and cheery for some but it's got some melodic charm to it anyway.<br /><br />This record was obviously made to be their masterpiece, where as the band was working with a few different styles and lyrical ideas before that made for ok listens, aside from Honesty Is No Excuse (a downright gem) off the debut, there wasn't a lot of breathtaking moments going on until now. Sadly the record was only of \\"cult status\\" upon it's release in 1973 and Eric Bell, disappointed, exited the group. The rest is history of course but even still, years later, this early trilogy of work from the original TL should be explored and found if you're a fan of 70s rock or hard rock in general. It's a nice progression through the 3 to see Lynott really coming into his own. This album was really it though, it has that somewhat raw/underproduced sound to it that made it feel like an underground record, as opposed to the tight, beefy sound of the Jailbreak era band. Great songs, hooks and energy abound all through Vagabonds though makes it most likely their best album next to Jailbreak or Black Rose. Not to say those forever classics didn't have such things, it's really the consistency here that shines. Every song is a keeper. The deluxe edition has a great helping of singles released at the time , and a whole 2nd disc of live/BBC recordings hardcore fans are gonna want. It's a tremendous package. So if you've been listening to Fighting, Jailbreak, Bad Rep, Live & Dangerous, Black Rose, Chinatown etc for years and wanna dig deeper, this is definitely the place to start. A total near masterpiece of story book hard rock.
0670026557|5.0|Give and Take, particularly the chapter on &#34;The Power of Powerless Communication&#34; is one of the most important books I have read in a long time. It will change the way people think and act when they work together.
B00BZB1ME6|4.0|My kids enjoyed the recently made Karate Kid starring Jaden Smith.  I decided they should see the 1984 version with Ralph Macchio.  They actually favored the older movie.  It's definitely one of the best movies from the 80's.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Great movie - - very realistic - - kind of scarry the way prisoners are interrogated - - hope our American troops are never subjected to waterboarding.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|My husband and I both loved &#34;Intouchables&#34; as it lived up to it billing!  Normally we are not big fans of films with sub-titles but with Intouchables you didn't even notice.  The acting was superb, quite funny but had many serious moments.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B0031RSBU0|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Fast paced action with a few twists in the plot that kept me guessing to the end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A fun addictive app which I have been hooked on since I first downloaded it. I love how the app is kept up to date with little side missions added here and there. Great little game.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I don't know how it compares to the non ad-free version, but I figured the less media advertising they were exposed to the better, so I'm pleased to have the option to get it ad free.  My kids have enjoyed it and love trying to beat the different levels.  I know I will definitely look for more ad-free versions when we decide to purchase other Angry Birds games.
B0068THAGY|4.0|A group of young friends are filming a Super 8 movie when a train explosively derails. The friends eventually continue their film trying to forget/ignore the event, but mysterious events throughout town begin to occur. Super 8 is a nostalgic and entertaining SciFi adventure.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story in this film. It has a sense of mystery and discovery, while mixing humor and adventure to create a great SciFi adventure. The action sequences are extremely well done, and the humor is genuinely funny and mostly clean. It looks like a J. J. Abrams film, but plays like Spielberg. The storytelling is simple and straightforward, so anyone can watch and enjoy it. The acting was great from the cast, and the music was phenomenal. The attempts at nostalgia may be too formulaic for some viewers; so, if you've been watching the classics similar to this, you should wait a bit before watching Super 8.<br /><br />Overall, Super 8 is an entertaining SciFi film with a nostalgic story, amazing visual effects, and superb music. As of 3/30/13, this film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video and Netflix Streaming; a purchase is recommended for fans of the genre, a rental otherwise.<br /><br />Super 8 has some strong violence and blood.
B001AFF25W|5.0|This is an excellent book, I strongly believe it is worth every penny that I spent. This book is a way to transform YOU to a highly effective person. I am so glad that I read this book at the right time because I got overwhelm from my University  works and other stuff, after I read this book I start to prioritise my time and less stress from my tasks. In fact, I have more time to do something that contribute more value in my life. You must read it.

0553328255|2.0|I was really excited for these books. I procrastinated on reading it, and finally cracked it open. Started out normal with a little paragraph on Doyle, an index, an introduction and the start of the first book A Study in Scarlet. It was normal until page 46, then on 47 it repeated itself. It had the paragraph, index, introduction and first 46 pages all over again. The second 46th page was followed by the 111th page. I am missing 65 pages, and it's the first story! it seems as if the other stories are just fine, but I am more or less out on the first story. Really wish I was provided with the proper product.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This series is superb--even though we have seen it on tv--we wanted our own copy to enjoy again and again

078322611X|3.0|I finally got the family together to watch this movie and of course we all loved it. However as i am looking more closely into the box I realize it is only one disc... This is why I am giving it a fair rating... good movie, false advertizing... If it's one disc with lots of extras then it needs to say so. We recieved it in great time though. I'm not displease with my purchase but it should have been what it said it was for the price...I would have bought it if it was listed as a one disc anyway, but that was not the way it was advertized.
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|Yes, I liked it.  Yes it hurt.  Yes, that's probably what it's like.  Yes, I'm glad I read it.  Thanks

B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Robert De Niro gives a great performance, everyone else is fun to watch too. A fun feel good story, told well thru the lens.... Not going to make my top 20 of all time list, but easily one of the best movies this year.
B0012FHGCW|4.0|This is of course an obvious statement, but a key one. I have not read the book, but I know it exists and I think my mom read it a couple of years ago then rented the movie and said something about the ending and different parts in the middle, and maybe the beginning, being different in either the book or the movie. Either way, I did watch the movie and thought the living in the wild parts were good, but not so much the parts that got all deep and visceral/avisceral?
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love Kindle. Since getting the books you have listed I have found enjoyment in my life Thank you so very much.

1250012570|2.0|I hesitated about purchasing this book, and actually passed it over once or twice.  In the end I did order the book and put in my stack of tbr.  I had a hard time getting through this book.  It was more of a chore than a joy and that is always a red flag for me.  I raised three sons and thought I would have some fun with this read.  I was disappointed.  I thought it was labored and, in the end, I should have followed my first instincts, and passed on the purchase.  I did not finish the read.  It is extremely well written and is excellent for the proper demographic, just not the over 60 group.

0345535421|4.0|After much resistance for continuing reading the series after the bloody turn of events in the first book, namely the near destruction of the Stark family, I found myself drawn back into finishing what I started with A Song of Fire and Ice. I love the HBO adaptation of &#34;A Game of Thrones&#34; and didn't want to cheat myself of discovering the subtle nuances that only the book version of the series can provide.  I am very glad that I decided to go back and pick up with &#34;A  Clash of Kings.&#34; This second book pulled me right back into GRRM's compelling version of the War of the Roses. I adore Danaerys Targaryn and it is her journey towards that &#34;second dance of dragons&#34; that compels me to stay with the storyline. I've read ahead somewhat and have braced myself for what is coming. But I still hold out hope that Dany and her dragon riders (I won't speculate on the other two here) will return to burn Westeros and the Lannisters to the ground. I'm now moving forward to the next book, A Storm of Swords.

B002VPE1WK|3.0|I have an Cannon and 2 lenses. This works well for carrying our stuff, but I am dissapointed in the quality. We have maybe used this backpack 8 to 12 times total, with minimal use. We are a family operation, nothing professional here. And the front storage pocket zipper and tab broke when opening it one time. I dont know if this is just our bag or if it reflect the quality of the product overall, but I would say just to be very cautious when using the zippers. And if you need a very durable, rugged, bag to be used often, I would recommend searching for a higher quality bag.

B00BFUUMO8|4.0|game play pleasant enough...not rocket science...some easy end rounds if you pay attention..downloaded on mar h 5th and currently getting ready to hit level 37..have not come close to spending real cash and have only just added a neighbor.  Only negative it that during a code red the screen moves to easily often causing escape of one of the meat eaters.  doses not require lot of consentration and easy to pop in for a quickie during commercials...kills time while waiting for show to come back on.
0525457585|4.0|This timeless children's classic will never grow old and was even good enough to make into a full-length feature film. As a child (she's 35 now) this was my daughter's favorite book and &#34;VHS&#34; (and yes, we still have it, plus the new DVD remake as well) while growing up. It is in the same league as CS Lewis' & Tolkien's work.

0767903374|5.0|The original book was recommended to me by a friend...she was reading this and thinking &#34;wow, that explains why I am like this!&#34;  I read it and was thinking &#34;you mean not everyone is like this???&#34;  We both came at this book from two different viewpoints...but ended up in the same place.  AMAZED!<br /><br />This book has probably changed my life (for the better)...it sure has helped me understand the things I experience, as well as that not everyone experiences the same things that I do.<br /><br />LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this book and looking forward to digging into the workbook supplement as a great tool!

Other than that it is great.  I like the simplicity of it and I have dropped my phone several times and it has protected it wonderfully.  It is a good buy.

0525478817|5.0|When we think about \\"true love\\" we think of two middle aged people meeting in the perfect place, get married on the perfect date, have perfect children, and living happily ever after.  Sometimes love doesn't work out that way.  Sometimes love happens between two people who do not know the full meaning of love yet.  Two people who do not expect to love and get it back; at least for the time being.  It's funny how one single unfortunate, hurtful event and life experience can bring two different people together and spark a relationship that is beyond true love.  John Green captures this reality perfectly in The Fault in our Stars.<br /> The story is about a girl named Hazel Graze Lancaster, 16, who has stage 4 thyroid cancer, and Augustus Waters, 17, who has Osteosarcoma.  They meet in a group session one day and their relationship escalates from there on out.  They both fall in love with each other and never leave each other's side. When that day comes (in the end of the novel) when life seems to shatter for Hazel, she comes to the reality that she is going to be living with cancer.  She realizes that she is happy with what she has done in her life, and would never do anything different.<br /> Cancer is an important issue in this world today.  We see people becoming diagnosed with the hundreds of different types, and most not making it out alive.  We mourn for those souls.  The patients however, look at life a totally different way, and John Green captures these realities and issues just perfectly.  Living with the cancer is just one upon dozens of the realities these cancer patients face.  Hazel never takes for granted anything in her life and always thanks her parents for what they have done.  She accepts the fact that someday she will die, even if it is sooner rather than later.  She is humble and becomes even more humble through all that she witnesses and experiences.  What we witness is a completely different side of it, and wanting to help these kids while reading the book, is not something uncommon.<br /> John Green is a fabulous writer who captures the reality and important, standing issues of cancer in our lives.  The Fault in our Stars is a perfectly written, well portrayed viewpoint on life with cancer.  Through two young peoples' struggles, the unfortunate reality of cancer brings them together.  We start to see actual, true love, come out of this book and it is an absolute page turner.  You will connect with the characters, feel their pain, and you will definitely be left on your toes wanting one last look at the fault in their stars.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I read for a living, and I read for fun. That's what this book was, fun. It was enjoyable from the first sentence. The main character was relatable, and I liked him, so I stayed interested throughout.  Mission accomplished, Mr. Author.

B00A6CT012|5.0|I ordered Bea's book after reading about it in a short feature in Martha Stewart Living magazine. I could not put the book down--she has so many excellent ideas, and she has tried EVERYTHING, which means you don't have to. Her family's lifestyle is more dedicated and extreme than many of her readers will choose to be, but she repeatedly acknowledges this and advocates doing as much as you feel comfortable with. Another thing I really appreciate about Bea is that she defies the prototypical \\"crunchy\\" environmentalist image--she dresses (very) fashionably, wears makeup, and emphasizes not only the environmental reasons for doing what she does (and this is certainly the predominant theme), but also its value in terms of simplicity, saving time, and improving quality of life. My husband and I currently live in Denmark, so her US-specific suggestions (and there are many) will have to wait until we return home in a few years, but we have already started to implement many of the things she suggested--and, more importantly, her philosophy is now always with me and impacts a lot of my small daily decisions. I highly, highly recommend this book.
B0073PPKNM|4.0|I didn't feel it was up to the quality of Worrisome Heart & My One & Only Thrill.  Maybe a little too much French taste for me.  But still a very strong CD that frequently finds itself in my player.
B00ANQMZOK|5.0|For many years I listened to the original Live At Leeds album and loved it, until I bought the extended version with additional songs and realized how much of the concert was missing and how much more I loved what I thought was a really great performance. I have to admit I was wrong, as good as the Leeds album is this Isle of Wright performance is so much better its amazing. The energy level the band performs at is double the Leeds concert, the song selection is more complete and unified (the selections from Tommy are much more fluid and integrated into the rock opera's overall concept as opposed to individual songs on Leeds), and the musicianship of the members more precise. energetic, and creative. Keith Moon, who I believe possibly to be the best drummer in rock) is just unbelievable, every song it like a solo as opposed to just keeping the beat; John's base not only anchors the songs but creates an exceptional counter point to Peter's creative and energetic guitar playing. The band seems invigorated by the crown, even though it's about 2AM, and plays with renewed enthusiasm and creativity over previous performances which I have heard. The sound is very good for an open air concert from the 70s, and whatever is lacking in sound quality is definately made up for by the exceptional performance. A must have album for not only Who fans but for any fan of extraordinary rock & roll!
B000WTNCYA|5.0|Every track on this CD is very pleasant to sit down and relax to.  Her talent and love of music comes out in most of her songs.  I really love it.

B004QL7K6G|4.0|Another light weight funny movie, but that's right up my alley.  Funny with a happy ending.  The case arrived completely smashed along with another movie I had ordered.  So ONE STAR for shipping.  The DVD appears to be ok... so I kept it.
B004SIP6C2|5.0|This movie will open your eyes on illegal abortions and orphanages in times past. As you watch the main characters live their lives, it will leave you sad as well as inspired.
B009R659L8|2.0|There's little in the way of character development here--the daughters are saintly white-hats, the father purely black-hatted.  And the &#34;twist&#34; at the end is lead-footed to say the least.  Even flu and overnight-air-flight reading needs more going for it than this has.
B000065KH4|5.0|This  movie is a good &#34;chic flick&#34; type of movie. It has quite a unique story line that  portrays the attitude of a small religious European town and its prejudices toward the new and unknown.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I cant remember that last time I really wished I could meet characters in a book- but I wanted to meet both James and Lydia.

0553801473|2.0|So I just finished ploughing my way through all 5 of the Song of Fire and Ice books and I'm regretfully finding myself in agreement with many of the other reviews here.  Despite the breathless reviews posted on the back cover hailing George RR Martin as the \\"American JRR Tolkein\\" what he's shaping up to be is the next Robert Jordan.  This is not a good thing.<br /><br />Like the late Mr. Jordan whose Wheel of Time series was strung out horrifically, padded with useless new characters and endless descriptions of clothing, and basically milked for all the new volumes it could sell until the author lamentably died before he was anywhere close to a conclusion, the Song of Fire and Ice series is showing disturbingly parallel tendencies.  While the series started reasonably strong in the first book or two, by book 5 it's clear the author has no idea where he's going, doesn't know how to keep the plot moving anymore or even build suspense except by the soap-opera-like device of continually having characters you think he's killed off amazingly resurrected (sometimes off-stage so you have no idea how this actually occurred), and he still maddeningly pads out his prose with endless lists of clans and the heraldry of all those present at any event whether or not those people will actually play a part in the subsequent plot.<br /><br />And like Robert Jordan, it is looking as if the author is likely to expire before he can finish.  Even in his book jacket photo on Dance With Dragons (which would normally be expected to show the author in the most flattering light), Mr. Martin does not look well.  I am certainly not wishing any ill health on him, but I really wish he'd just get on with it and wrap up all the various plot lines in one final, climactic book.  Robert Jordan would have written a modern masterpiece if he'd had the willpower to make it a 6-book series; George RR Martin would be well-advised to do so.<br /><br />This is really a failure of editing.  It's an understandable problem - once an author becomes a wildly-successful bestseller, no editor has the power or the guts to say, \\"George, this is a piece of long-winded crap that doesn't go anywhere.  Take it back and cut it by 50% and tighten up all the plotlines.\\"  But I guess they figure they'll sell a lot more books this way.<br /><br />As long as the author can survive the experience.<br /><br />Bottom line - I think I'll wait until I hear that the series has actually been completed before I purchase another volume.ble problem - once an author becomes a wildly-successful bestseller, no editor has the power or the guts to say, \\"George, this is a piece of long-winded crap that doesn't go anywhere.

B00015YVDG|5.0|A suspense thriller with some twists. I'm not a big fan of Mel Gibson, but this movie is very good. Have watched it many times.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|The book is good, but (being a Clarissa myself,) I wanted to smack the CHEESE out of Clary!!! Her behavior was so foolish. It seemed that she wad very ungrateful and blind to everyone's sacrifices for her!(But she is a teen) Jace had it harder than Aiden in Being Human season 3 did in this book! He just couldn't catch a break! Aside from the love Pentagon it seems, I truly enjoyed this book, and hope that the next one brings me so me closure....which is Jace and Clary being together.
B005FNJL7K|4.0|If you have a setting like Ravinia in Chicago or any other live public performance arena and they say they are performing Lord of the Rings, this is about what you will hear. It's got all the melodies you look for, but not necessarily in the film order.
0307950654|3.0|It's been six years since the conclusion of \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" and the Darcys have settled into a happy marriage. They have two healthy sons, and the Bingleys are now their neighbors. Lydia, the youngest Bennet sister (Jane Bingley being the eldest and Elizabeth Darcy the second out of five girls), is a frequent visitor to the Bingleys and to her parents' home; but in both places she is always received without her husband, the handsome but unprincipled George Wickham. Readers of Jane Austen's classic will remember that Wickham seduced Lydia into running away with him, and he married her only after financial inducement offered by Darcy. That wealthy man salvaged the situation, and Lydia's honor, only out of love for Elizabeth. Wickham was the son of a Darcy servant, who grew up on the Pemberley estate with the Darcy heir almost as a foster brother. His misadventures after both were grown included an attempt to seduce Georgiana Darcy, the current Mr. Darcy's much younger and vulnerable sister; and for that alone Darcy would hate him. So when Lydia arrives at Pemberley on the eve of the estate's traditional autumn ball, hysterical and screaming that her husband has been murdered in the Pemberley wood, no one is glad to see her; but as Elizabeth's sister, she cannot be refused help.<br /><br />The tale that follows this beginning is true enough to the Austen characters, and it's also a decent enough mystery. Author James does commit a few anachronisms, but overall she mimics Austen's style fairly well, too. Pretty good, but not - for me, anyway - outstanding.<br /><br />--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of 2005 science fiction EPPIE winner \\"Regs\\"

B0089LOKHG|2.0|I liked the first book, thought the second was even better... But struggled to finish this story.  I liked how the author changed her writing style in each of the books (first person, now/then, Lena/Hanna) but I just felt this book didn't keep my attention like number 2.  I also don't like how the story is left open, with several unanswered questions.  Please don't drag this series out any further!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am not one of the many fans of 50 Shades.  I thought the story line was immature and rather ridiculous.  It is very graphic.... not erotic!  I kept hoping it would get better but that didn't happen.  It is one continuous story just broken up into 3 books to make more money.  I don't recommend it.

3836528347|4.0|Do not be misled. This stunningly beautiful collection of work should be in the collection of anyone interested in advertising - or in American culture - of any time, and its appeal is not limited to those who are fond of the 1950s and 1960s, or the television show that features the exploits of Don Draper and his merry pranksters.<br /><br />Jim Heimann has created something in two elegant volumes that is more than a repository, more than an encyclopedia, more than an archive. Over the course of more than 700 pages across two oversized volumes, Mr. Heimann, pulling apparently from his personal collection, has assembled a stunning array of work. Some are beautiful (for example the Container Corporation ad featuring a George Washington quotation) and some are just bizarre (see the ad for Old Gold cigarettes on p. 121, or the one facing it featuring a secretary wearing a diving helmet). Some I still can't believe they sold - like the one for Tangee lipstick on p. 124 and some that just make me want to buy the poor copywriter a drink (\\"Fun in the sun with steel\\"? Really?)<br /><br />Each volume also includes an (to see the rest of this review, please visit theagencyreview.wordpress.com/mad-men-ads)

B0070DOHQS|5.0|[[ASIN:B0070DOHQS Jump Desktop (RDP & VNC)]]<br /><br />How refreshing to see this app as a freebie and even for the asking price it is truly well worth it. Since we live in a wireless world why not have this on your phone & tablet? In some ways being able to access your media, playlists and such really makes this accessible to your fingertips when you are physically away from your pc or notebook! This app may well likely replace some of the other apps that are specific to one feature, think about it and give it a try. For example iTunes on a Android base device, hhmm. Airplay simple with this handy multi-tool ;-)<br /><br />So easy to install you can accomplish this with one eye!

I have just cancelled my order because I will not pay for two combos to get the discs I need. I have one 3D TV and sometimes we like to watch the 2D version in another room.

1936719010|5.0|Most New Year's Resolutions are won or lost around late January. The reason? We're half-way through the month. People's motivations begin to wean. The desire to keep going drains at every passing day because there's this voice inside of all of us that tells us to stop. The voice is what Author, Stephen Pressfield, calls in his book, \\"Do the Work\\", the Resistance. It is Resistance that says hit the snooze button, you don't need to pray for 10 minutes today, you ran enough & you don't need run the full 30 minutes, you can finish that book you've been working on another day, and it's fine to stay status quo. I say tell Resistance that you're stronger and fight. Fight to beat back the temptation to want to give up - because you know that if you want something bad enough - if you really, really want it - and your motivation is pure and your desire is true -- you won't want to stop. You won't want to give in to Resistance. Go buy Pressfield's book and read it. It's short, concise, and like a jack hammer beating the down the concrete sidewalk, he helps you beat down the Resistance, re-center and re-focus!
B00C8USQEM|5.0|Very funny show, but I'm guessing you're already aware of that.<br /><br />I read several unfavorable reviews of this boxed set, and can't say I've experienced the same problems (no sign the set is pirated, no issues with playback or quality on my blu-ray player, no sketchy printing on the dvd's/insets/box).  Then again, I did not order the set as it's currently seen listed (sold by Nanobuy; fulfilled by Amazon).  Instead, I purchased from Amazon seller a2z for $10 cheaper.  Not sure if this might be the difference.<br />If you also purchase from a2z, know that the set is the UK all region blu-ray set.  I have an older Sony blu-ray player, and they play just fine and look fine.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|No the ending of all times but kind of the style of all the trilogy, high expectation not equal rewarded.<br />Nevetheless it gets you pretty easy into the plot.  It is an easy book to read, a nice option for non native english speakers.
B00CCZ4BFQ|5.0|Love the new album. Flower is the standout!! Solid Ground rocks!!  The whole album rocks!!! Would like to see you come to The National in Richmond!!

B00AA0TZTW|5.0|What can be said about Jimi Hendrix.  He was and still is the best guitar player and innovator that has ever lived.  I bought everyone of his records when they came out in the 1960's.  I can still listen to all his music and have the same feeling I did listening to him years ago.  He was way ahead of his time.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|i love it!!<br /><br />its like real life with more fun<br /><br />if you wanna have fun and have a good time this is must watch!!!
1616550414|5.0|Having not only concept art work, but also the official time line of Hyrule, this book is worth every penny. It's hard back, beautifully bound and looks great in any book collection, whether your into Hemingway or Hyrule.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This a fun game to play, I really enjoy playing and I love that it is like a puzzle and really gets you confused and mad when you lose. I really think that others should play this game. Enjoy!!!
B001ECDVKE|5.0|I am 64 and going on 65, and I saw this movie a while back and thought it was funny then. Now I watch it and see that it has a lot of truth in the fact that the common man/woman can do more in protecting themselves then with the help of the government.
B00BF11UM0|4.0|The dark dirty work it takes to keep the many safe .  Documentary style . Also able to watch it any were any time .
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I got the 3lue, this and Razer to replace my MS wireless mice at home and work.<br /><br />All amazing mice.  3lue's thumb buttons are too close to you/palm of your hand and hard to find.  But for $11, that was great for work.<br /><br />Razer and this were very comparable.  One thing I did not see in the add that should be mentioned is that this has a very nice cloth braided cord!  Much like the Razer.<br /><br />As far as design, LEDs (can set it to any color, can't change it on Razer), feel of the mouse, this is the best mouse I've ever tried.<br /><br />The buttons blew me away.  They are ALL comfortably reached and distinguishable with ease (and I'm not good at that).  AND they are programmable with a simple downloaded app.<br /><br />This was going to be the winner in all fronts, including price for me, but alas I don't use a mouse-pad, I just put my mice on my desk with a wrist pad, and unlike the 3lue and Razer, the feet on this one would EVER so slightly stick to my desk.  Never while in motion, but when trying to point at something precise, I'd end up a millimeter to the side, and trying to move back would mean the ever so slight jerk to get it from the ever so slight sticking to move, ending the cursor yet at the other side of where I wanted to point.<br /><br />So, if you have a mousepad, I'd recommend this instead.  More buttons, better design, all around better mouse.  Otherwise, get the Razer.  If you dont' have much money or don't care about the side buttons, then get the E-3lue Cobra Type-M EMS131BK High Precision Gaming Mouse
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Its just not as good as it could have been . great concept movie with a not so great twist .

B008HK3XU4|5.0|After purchasing and returning 3 seperate Kindle Fire cases, I finally found this one! My Kindle Fire HD fits into it perfectly!  It also seems to be very protective and durable, which is important because I travel a lot.  I am very satisfied with this case!!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|As a parent, this is both an interesting story and very disturbing.  We live in a very complicated time and this story seems to bring together several topics of what we hear going on in our teen's lives.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|I enjoyed this book and the slice of poor Irish life that it affords the reader but it is quite repetitive. He basically tells the same stories over and over.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|The best movie of the year. Kristen Stewart was so good in the movie. The other chacters were good too.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|If you like Downton Abbey, you'll LOVE Lark Rise to Candleford!  Can't get enough of these wonderful characters!!  Gorgeous cinematography, full of laughs and tears!  Wonderful!!!
B004XZR63M|5.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad is a great book! I bought it for my two teenagers and have been reading it myself. Great insight on how to avoid the trap of the mundane working life. Great book for adults or kids who think out of the box!

B00A757EFW|5.0|Great for first time beginners, the kids love it, it cost 3.00 to play the full version. I will purchase
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game it is really cool and I really liked it. I am totally obsessed with it. Best game ever!!
B000YAA68C|5.0|For a romantic comedy, this movie is great.  I'm always bawling through it.  It's good for some tears and laughs.  Not great for a man though.  Watch it with your girl friends or alone.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen, and the best movie out this year.  Rented it the first time and loved it- rented it a second time and it was even better!
B0087EACJK|5.0|Simple yet complex. A fun game to play to pass time. Careful it can be addictive!! Levels get more challenging the further you get.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|when I'm about to have fun, time just went out.<br />it could be fun if it's little bit longer. not cool.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|There was a lot of predictability throughout the book until the last chapter which seemed to rush through a conclusion and then tie everything up into a neat little package.<br />Most of the pace was too slow throughout.<br />I am a fan of McEwan and was excited to read this book but it left me feeling a bit flat.
B000ETQR3Q|2.0|This gun jams all the time and it ruins our very expensive bullets.  The only reason it even gets two stars is because my son likes to play with it without the bullets.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|How can you argue with a Disney Classic? Very happy with the purchase of the video. Snow white all the way.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|awesome game for wasting time.  doesn't cost a penny to play.  only problem with this game is a problem with loading enemy and allied bases.  would recommend game to anyone.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I got this game because I was playing another g5 game. But so far this is a good game and I have had many hours of fun. I would recommend this game.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|I have been waiting a long time for a good Star Wars Pinball game to appear and what do you know! This Star Wars Pinball game not only met my expectations, but exceeded my expectations! The force is definitely strong with this one!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Engaging action. Almost non stop.  As with all books in this genre, the premises and situations strain credulity.  This author does it so well that you don't notice.  Enough of a page turner that I read it in a single sitting.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|Being died-in-the-wool fans of TV Bones, our expectations for this book fell short. And Temperance's character doesn't really connect tv vs. book
B000PC0S5K|5.0|what he says in the other books but in a more literary form  easy reading  easy reading  easy reading  easy
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This product is a great  way for people to see how far they can run and what they can collect.
1577311523|5.0|the best of spiritual teaching in a new and clear layout  says the good stuff but with different handles  easy to grasp
B000P6PVLC|2.0|This movie builds you up for a VERY big let down! The story is riveting and the plot keeps you glued to the story until the end when it runs into the let down brick wall! This movie frustrated me so much that I really don't know how to recommend it! The story is very interesting, the price for the movie was great, the ending Huge Let Down!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|This was a great movie!  I really loved it.  The acting was completely convincing.  The story was so tense and, at the same time, patriotic.  I felt this was a very good historic event told at a time of historic long drawn out misery.  Many thanks to Canada,  What a great neighbor!
B007H7XJD4|1.0|This was a waste of time, the story....snorezville. The plot was so dull, they should sell this movie as a sleeping aid! Two thumbs down!
B005LAIIHG|1.0|After all the high judgments of this film at the Academy Awards, I was expecting something great, instead it was something boring.  I found myself wishing the tiger would eat the young man.  The only relief I felt when the boat landed on the Mexican coast was that the movie was finally over.
B004LDLI0S|3.0|I read most of it and became bored?  He would have been a great leader if he had some heart for all people and not just for the Germans.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|good acting and a nice plot...action was pretty fluid throughout and it was easy to follow. the blood splattering was a bit much.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Justin is in find form as he sings songs that remind me of good times with lovers.  Wow, can't wait to see him in person.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|satisfying story with plenty of science mixed in. an excellent read for anyone from wannabes to experienced runners. a classic.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Even though Beth Hart did not perform with Joe when we saw this concert in Springfield, Missouri, it brought back one of the most enjoyable evenings of music we've experienced since those we attended in the 70's.  I don't think I've ever heard anyone play guitar like this!  We love JOE!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|It was an extrmely well written hook that kept me guessing. I find that I am a tough one to surprise, and this book totally took a turn that I didn't see coming. This author's work just cant be put down. I've already read another one of her books, sharp objects. It's is fabulous too.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Not sure why I didn't see this when it came out in theaters, but figured I'd better watch it before Into Darkness comes out. I loved it!!! Really!!! Pacing is good, never slow or dull, characterizations are good for original Trekkies and interesting for new viewers, plus lots of inside jokes for old timers. He's got a red suit on! &#34;Good God, man!&#34; and of course &#34;I'm giving it all she's got, Captain!&#34; Can't wait to see Benedict Cumberbatch go up against Kirk and Spock; I hope it's as much fun as this one.
B0041VT6HW|4.0|Some of the special effects were kind of cheesey but other than that I enjoyed watching it. The over all story was good.
030771652X|5.0|Not very often do I read a book, and wish it would never end. That along with a few very late nights because I didn't want to stop reading, definitely the best book I have read in a while. Interesting twist at the end too, to begin with I wasn't impressed about, but actually thinking about it, it was a good way to go. Although I did still have questions, and no more pages to answer them..... but on the other hand, maybe they were *mysterious*<br />If you like a whodunit type book, or the style of 'diary/letters' writing, this is deffo a book for you.
B0053O89JM|5.0|I love House and this was the last season I needed. So glad I found a good deal on it  and shipped fast
B007W1BLN0|3.0|Into the Wild, one of the few true stories you will find of a brilliant person's attempt to make it in the average man's world.  He stabs along at it with some successes and failures until the ultimate test.
B00275EHJQ|4.0|This is a an excellent movie to watch with the family. My two year old loved the movie and certain parts had her fully engaged. It is not as good as the original but some moments are more exciting.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|This app is nearly perfect for a timer/stopwatch app. My only complaints are with the UI&ndash;which is not very attractive and seems to have some difficulties when my device is in landscape mode&ndash;and the notification icon, which doesn't always stay up-to-date with the actual timer. Otherwise, one of the best timer apps I've used so far!
B007MHVVCU|5.0|This book was so awesome. There was ash / monster dogs.  ghost dinosaurs , witches , people crushing monsters , just great! I highly recomend this book to other people.  :)
B005XBKXV2|5.0|I really enjoyed the look on my sons face as he listened to the songs and laughed at the characters.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|The beauty of the English language is very cleverly portrayed in this story..<br />Also the story itself is unique.  It is amazing how the ideas of zoo animals<br /> and philosophical stance, blend to make  this tale so interesting.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I will now start to listen to my heart and persue and find my very own Personal Legend.<br /><br />God Bless
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|As a fan of Orson Scott Card and Suzanne Collins, I strongly recommend this series to those with similar tastes. You will not be disappointed.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Can play for hours! Loved the first one and this one adds a whole different level. Definitely get this fun and easy game.
B00BM1AJIO|1.0|I can't review the game because it will not download. the first part downloads and installs but then it has to download more. The large file size (over 500mb) runs for hours with pauses because it claims it lost the internet (with full bars displayed) when the kindle is next to the router which is alive and well and ends with the message &#34;download failed&#34;. At $4.99 this is an expensive game that doesn't work. Save your money, this one is a rip off!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great simple game for ease and relaxation momentarily. I also like that coins regain quickly.great for kids too. Thank you.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|It sure is what you expect from Buble but I really want to her him sing more of his own original music instead of the 'oldies'. i find I get more into the new stuff.
B0000CF35F|5.0|Its a classic rock album. I love it on vinyl too much. Go for it and enjoy the best album of AC DC!
0385349947|5.0|This book is more than an exposure of the gender biases that subtly pervade the workplace. Through her experiences and anecdotes Sandberg also provides advice to all readers about living a healthy and balanced life. Your job -- as Sandberg has learned from her own experiences -- only takes over your life as much as you let it. You must set your own boundaries and many times your preconceived notions regarding what is expected of you are simply not true.<br /><br />We all are not going to be as successful as Sheryl Sandberg. We all don't have the same ambitions. But we can all live happy and successful lives setting our own limits and abiding by them.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I find it a little difficult to follow but I am enjoying the book.  I have not finished the book yet but do plan on re-reading it.
B0029LCJJS|2.0|I really like period shows, but I don't want to watch soft porn along with the story line.  I don't think it adds to the story at all.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Not a big fan of the man, but pleasantly surprised at the acting. The story line is interesting and engaging. I enjoyed the pace and the intrigue in the story.
B00AKKS278|4.0|I was looking for a book to help me increase my time-management and help me get up earlier. This book was a very pleasant read, very interesting and motivating. Hal is a great writer and i look forward to reading more of his work!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Absolutely loved this book! Saw the movie first and decided to check out the book. Loved the author's writing style and enjoyed learning even more about all of the characters. If you loved the movie, you will definitely enjoy the book!
B00004TX5F|5.0|great production with costumes, the acting and scenic countryside--and of course, the music is fantasticcally digitalized<br />to make the whole film top-notch
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is simply one of the best books I have ever read. Keeping track of all the characters can be a bit tricky at first, but three books in I feel like I know them all. Cannot wait to read the next one!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie had unexpected twists and turns that made for great surprises. I honestly enjoyed this movie more than most of the best picture nominees. I may plan to purchase this on blu-ray in the future.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Like many others, I read this book after seeing a bit of the breathless hype and all the five-star reviews.  After finishing it, I have to say that I don't get the hype.  I really wanted to like it, and I'm happy that the author was able to break through with a self-published hit, but I found large segments of the book to be simultaneously boring and depressing.  There are generally two things that I look for in science fiction: (1) Interesting \\"big ideas\\" combined with plausible science treatment.  I think the author did a good job of creating an interesting concept, but nothing really blew my mind like the ideas in an Arthur C. Clarke book, for example.  And while I'm fine with authors taking liberties with science (e.g., inventing a way to exceed to speed of light is a common plot device), I didn't find the author's treatment of technology to be convincing. (2) Tight, fast-paced storytelling.  This is where the book let me down (minor spoilers to follow).  For a fairly long book, there was only one character, Jules, who felt well developed to me.  I never felt like I understood Lukas; I only knew that he had a crush on Jules.  There were times when I thought the author was going to give more personality to Bernard and make me understand his motivations, but he basically ends up as a generic bad guy.  There are long stretches when not much happens.  And perhaps most frustratingly, the plot also depended on people behaving in ways that made no sense to me (this is hard to get into without big spoilers, but I found myself constantly thinking Why would anyone do that/ believe that/ react that way?).  In the end I was left with an interesting concept but a slow pace and characters who were either two-dimensional or underdeveloped.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|longer than it needed to be. A good film with plenty of action. Wasn't as funny as anticipated. Wish the story could have been more developed, especially considered how long it was.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I have always loved books with adventure and a love story. This book definitely had both! I couldn't put it down and I can't wait to start the third!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I didn't think I'd like it -- another chick book about trying to find herself -- but it turned out to be a great read!
B0094MFITS|5.0|I'm a fan of Robert B Parker and Tom Selleck is perfect for the role.  I wish the entire series was available.
B005MJDJQQ|5.0|A little disappointed the story stopped without finishing Stephen saga. what happened to him? Was the girl who burned molested too?
B0029EDMEG|5.0|I'm a fan of Robert B Parker and Tom Selleck is perfect for the role.  I wish the entire series was available.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Few books hold my interest these days, but this one did!  Enjoyed the twists and turns.  The female character was not very credible, and the ending blew. But it was definitely worth reading.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|Derry, Maine has suffered a great deal of tragedies dating way back to the colonial days (even further still!) yet these numerous occurrences and deaths haven't ever been made a great deal of or caused anyone any deal of concern, almost like the people of Derry have been looking the other way for centuries.<br /><br />In the summer of 1957, and the few months leading up to it, Derry has begun having these strange occurrences happen again, in the form of young children disappearing and sometimes being found mutilated beyond recognition near storm drains or water releases. Seven young individuals suffer individual experiences with whomever or whatever is behind these events, which draws them together in the strongest of friendships as they depend on each other to put their lives on the line to stop It, the evil in the form of a clown that has reeked havoc on their small town for generations.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|This app was supposed to be fun or something and it actually was just a waste of time.....it kept telling me that Tom the cat stopped working ... it really was a let down
B000JMKQX0|5.0|From what I have seen, the upcoming Brad Pitt movie of the same name does not follow the book as much as I would have hoped. It actually seems to take very little from the original text. It's understandable that not everything written can transfer to film as well as we would like, so I won't be walking into the theatre with pessimism in my head, but I digress...<br /><br />World War Z is the companion piece to Max Brooks' previous work \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\". WWZ's premise is set after the legions of the undead have successfully laid claim to nearly the entire planet, and humanity has already survived and started their recovery. A traveling journalist meets with various individuals from over the globe and asks them to share their experiences during the epidemic of zombies that almost wiped out the human race. These stories are what make up the majority of the book. Some are touching, others frightening, and some pump you up and almost make you wish you were there in the action! Excellent, entertaining, and very well written!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Good graphics New obstacles it's an awesome game fun and interesting...... kwani review ni refu aje?? Nimemaliza ama is vipi?
0920668364|5.0|This was a book I had read to my children and lost.  My son was killed in a tragic accident, and &#34;love you forever, momma&#34; were the last words he every said to me, a few days before.  My husband bought it as a gift so I could keep those memories alive.  I can never thank him enough for it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It's very fun, easy to learn and the changing locations is a really good idea. Keeps the game interesting. This game is fun, I'll continue to play it for a long time.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I've been a Rush fan for about 30 years.  Like all great albums, this took me a long time to soak in because the complexity of song and melody.  It actually took me about a year before I actually started to appreciate it.  Now one particular song I cannot get out of my head, it is so well written IMO.  The Garden.  I just love the melody, chord structure, and arrangement.  I'm a bit of a amateur song writer, and that is a master class.  That is how it is done.  I'm typically partial to their harder songs, and they are also great on here, but I just love that song.  So much great layering, to a nice crescendo.  I actually love every song on this album.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|I thought that this movie was well made, had a good plot, and was entertaining. My younger brothers and sisters enjoyed watching it with me and it was a good family movie.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|Saw the movie and it was fabulous, my 15 year old even loved it. The soundtrack is actually for her.
B000059MEL|5.0|this album it´s a relly really awesome work from daft punk, an item that you need to get and listen, a true colector piece and a really nice álbum.
1567184855|5.0|This book is highly interesting and well developed.  I really enjoyed reading it and got consumed by the deep concepts.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|The video itself was quite good. No problems with viewing it by way of my Roku unit.<br />I liked the movie but was a tad disappointed at how the movie deviated from the book in places. There was too much time spent on Radagast, for example. The battle with the goblins in the cave went on much too long and had too many unbelievable scenes. I had no such complaints about the Lord of the Rings series. And, the final confrontation on the cliff was simply too far off from the book to suit me.<br />I plan to re-read the book to make sure my memory is right.<br />At any rate, I approve of this movie and I'll confess I am quite a Tolkien fan.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I absolutely love this album. Justin Timberlake has done it again. This album was worth the wait. Looking forward to part two
B00755MHXG|4.0|A poignant and charming story told from the viewpoint of Augie, a 10 year old boy who was born with severe facial disfigurement. Augie, his family and school friends come to life in this sensitive look into the problems he faces when going to school for the first time. In the space of a year Augie faces his most fearful challenges with courage, but his 10 year old school mates and their parents are also tested, with varying results. This is a beautifully crafted book I will read to my grand children - and I will take some lessons from it as well.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Interesting and certainly held my attention.  I like this author and read Gone Girl first.  This is not as good but still had moments.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game. Very addicting. This games is a lot more difficult than I originally thought it would be. The graphics run smooth and look great on my Kindle.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Quick read always moving always entertaining. Loved the characters. Good. Relationships between everybody . A little conveluted at the end. Little too unbelievable with the body armor so quickly donned by Michelle. Still and all worth recommending to one and all.
B00CMNTOI2|5.0|You got my attention all the way! It's very difficult to find these days such a great escape from annoying dumb reality series all over TV.Thank You guys!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I love being able to tell how much power is left in my kindle fire battery.  This product gives specifics for standby, audio, video etc.  I worked with instrumentation during my career and like to see more precise measurements.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I've been a &#34;random&#34; fan of Anthony Bourdain's No Reservation show for some time, but never watched it consistently until a few weeks ago.  The TC was having a marathon, so I decided to DVR a bunch of them, and now I am HOOKED on Anthony Bourdain.  I've since finished reading Kitchen Confidential (which was great.  If you like his snarky, arrogant attitude on his TV shows, you'll love his writing), and I've moved on to The Nasty Bits.  These are great beach/plane reads and are highly entertaining.  I've now got a MAJOR foodie crush on Bourdain.  Yum, yum.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I downsized from an otterbox, so I could put my iPhone in my wristlets wallet. Easy to install, and has protected my phone so far.
B0063M22QO|4.0|so far very nice.I love playing Mahjong and this game fits the bill. Haven't played all the levels will enjoy working my way up.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|They really out did themselves. I have been following these guys for a long time and the saying &#34;disco is alive&#34; is now more true then ever.
B00C32R64G|5.0|The best volbeat yet. Lola Montes is a song that will last for a long long time. Ive been listening it for a week solid and the newness is not wearing off.  I love this band and the album.
B007ZXK08C|2.0|Very disappointed with this book could not make head or tails with the story and just seemed to go on about nothing with a stupid ending.  Would not recommend this book to anyone
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is so easy and simple to use! I recommend this app for anyone with a kindle. The developers did a great job by not over thinking or over doing this app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it. You have daily challenges and you have to watch out for the cops. I think the characters that you can get are really kool.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|its okay. of course candy crush saga is way better but I haven't been able to find something similar for kindle. candy crush saga is my favorite.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|I love this series, but my wife hasn't see the first season, so she is in for a real treat.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|Really good book, very well written, great characters and story lines. Sometimes the author would go off in these fantastical descriptions of rooms or houses or story lines which got a little tiring and i heard myself say, 'all right lets get going here' but the author always came back to point of the story. Great read for those who are a fan of Kate Morton books such as The Forgotten Garden and The Distant Hours, etc
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|Another great read from Jeffrey Archer, can't wait for the next book in the series to find out what happens
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great game. Really enjoying all the tasks and challenges you have to do. Do download. Game is addictive so do prepare to be always on your kindle  x
0061992860|5.0|I looked locally for this book for several weeks... Ended up buying the full size version at a local bookstore for $20. But after spending a few hours trying to figure out a spot in my 511 Rush 72 B.O.B... I caved in and ordered this version. It's tiny! Had to stop at Walmart and pick up a credit card magnifier to assist in reading the micro fish sized font.(I have great eye sight too) But it is an absolute MUST HAVE for any emergency bag. And you can't beat the price... Hope this helps..
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved almost everything- the surprises, dramatic deaths, romance, the whole concept of the hunger games of the Capitol ruling over all the districts, then the uprising.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|Loved the opening and it kept drawing me into the story all the way through.<br />Fantastic discussion of ancient monestaries, paper and vellium making and writing on same. You might want to take a detour from the book and take a look at the St. John's Bible newly created in MN.<br />A thinking person's book of things scientific and spiritual. Will reenforce your thinking whether believer or not----pay particular attention to chapter 8 and see how you rate the Lucretian Challenge.<br />Good summer reading---
B000FC146C|5.0|Great book! It keeps getting better every time I read it! I plan to read it again and again! Especially love it on the kindle
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This show caught my interest right away.  I love the court settings and the action with the husband.  I am still in season one, and hope it continues.
1931559317|5.0|I have a planisphere and the Peterson Field Guide, but I find myself using this atlas when I go out to observe specific objects.  The larger size of these atlas pages make the detail much more obvious than the smaller scale maps in the Field Guide.  This is a real resource for all amateurs.
B0055S348W|1.0|Did not work with kindle fire of time and money. It simply does not work with my hd 7inch Kindle
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Nothing ever bad happens and no lagging or buffering junk. You should really consider buying this game for your children!
B000JMKQX0|1.0|Honestly I was expecting a lot more zombie story and a lot less &#34;interview&#34; style. The mass number of characters made it confusing to see who is doing what. The timelines were a mess as well. After reading about 2/3rd of the book I gave up just wish I could return it and get my money back.
B005723JSQ|5.0|This book is written just like all her others.  Fun, quick, and great.  Another hit from Sophie Kinsella.  Can't wait for the sequel.
0670023329|4.0|This book documents the atrocities committed by N. Korea on its citizens and the author did a good job building up the anticipation as I waited to see if the escapee, was actually going to make it.  Loaned it to a friend and highly recommend it to others.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Sam and Dean are back for another round of fighting in the seventh season of Supernatural.  Leviathons take over the world, Castiel becomes Emmanuel, Dean gets drugged by a Turduckin Sandwich, Bobby runs away from a reaper, Crowley plays both sides of the game board, Sam tries to hold everything and everyone together, a surprise visit from a previous demon shakes things up when they try to fight on the side of good, the Word of God is found, a prophet awakens, and Dick Roman is at the center of it all.  It wasn't the best season, but it wasn't the worst either.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|The insulation on the original cable deteriorated into a cracked and shedding mess.  Amazon replaced it with no hassle.  This functions as intended.  although it seems a bit thinner I find it more compact which takes up less room in the travel bag.  The only negative is that the original shouldn't have needed replacement.
B00AWQEKIK|3.0|I am the worlds biggest Stephen Stills fan, and like any big fan, I already have all his albums, solo and with CSN and Y. This collection is almost all songs that are already out there. When Graham Nash said before release that this set would show the world who Stills' really is, I was drooling for it-only to be disappointed in the lack of revelation here. While I love all these songs, this boxed set is mediocre, at best.
B00192IOBA|4.0|Ok I really like this CD. I really enjoy the you-maka-me-happy melodies and the story lines in the lyrics. I would recommend buying the CD....
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey, thanks for making your ebooks so affordable. Because of the reviews and the high ranking on Amazon, I read the free sample.The first chapter is a great short story in and of itself, so I was compelled to buy the series to find out what happens next in this intriguing world. I was so disappointed when the Kindle status bar reached 100% and the story was over!
B000002LGQ|5.0|Once you've read this review, you won't need to read my other postings concerning Madonna CDs. I totally LOVE Madonna's music from the 80's all the way through her last recording. There's so much energy in her music! It just make a person want to move. So by all means....buy this CD and enjoy!
B0094KF4WG|1.0|This is how they publish junk to make you believe it was a real deal. No SEAL ever breaks his silence, EVER! This is a fable, a story book to make the sheep of this world believe it is true. Use it for starting fires.

B009MYARIK|2.0|I have ready all of Sophia Kinsella's books.  If this had been my first, it would have been my last.  The characters were weak and immature.  The story line was so transparent.  I did not find myself responding positively to any character.

B006VFLIYK|5.0|Mr. Baldacci is one of those super authors that I look for. In other words, if one has not known of him, they are not a reader. I love his early stuff,  but  then again like every thing by This author. The Innocent ist good. Strong characters plenty of action and good story line. I wish I could write like this.Ah, but I will just read.  Thank you
B00CBBY638|5.0|Loved his first release, Troublemaker, and almost didn't expect the album to be just as good. Definitely worth a listen.
B000QCQ8Y4|3.0|i think it drags on, takes to long, I've read other Jack Reacher book and love the quick action from the first page.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|One of the best games on my kindle! I only found 1glitch but other than that it is a great game! I wish that there was more ways to get bling  If you like this game get Pet Shop Story

B0083GR6Y6|4.0|It was a seller from the plane crash scene to their journey through the snow . Once the wolves were involved with the movie it got very exciting very traumatizing l felt bad for those guys wouldn't want to be in that situation. You would think that they would find their way out of the frozen mountains or a plane would come and rescue them but neither happened very good movie
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Every so often I come across that perfect book that exemplifies why I read in the first place. Books that suck me in and I am so deeply entranced that I can't hear, see, or feel anything going on around me - I am simply transported into the book and immersed in a world created by the author. HOPELESS is one of those books for me.<br /><br />HOPELESS is the perfect combination of passionate love story and heartrending life events. It had me laughing out loud so hard I howled - then a few chapters later it had tears streaming down my face. It had so many amazing quotes that I highlighted almost an entire book worth of my favorites. And Sky and Holder's first kiss - where they never even kissed??? Most. Passionate. Book. Experience. Ever. And they didn't even KISS! There are simply not enough words for how amazing Colleen Hoover's writing is - every book I've read by her has taken so much, but given even more.<br /><br />I loved Sky - she was sassy and independent and vulnerable. I understood her emotions and felt them like they were my own. And Holder? I don't know if there are words to describe the perfection that was Holder. Even the smaller characters like Six and Brecken were funny and witty and perfect compliments to the story.<br /><br />This book broke my heart - but more importantly it made me fall in love. It was passionate and painful and beautiful and so incredibly written I'm thankful I got to read it. Thank you Colleen Hoover for digging so deep and giving us this piece of magic.<br /><br />**Complimentary copy provided by author/publisher for an honest review.
086571701X|4.0|We got this book to help my son and I do an aquaponics system for a science fair project (my son won first place in his category). The information about cycling was invaluable and the various systems were very informative. There were some aresa that I felt were not covered - things a beginner needs to know. Exactly how high should water go up on plants or should I do someting about the algae growing in the tank. Overall it was a good book.
B005FUTC86|5.0|The movie arrived quickly and properly packaged.  One of  my favorites as a child, we rented on amazon prime and decided to purchase for our collection of family movies. Our children really enjoyed the movie in spite of the lack of technological theatrics kids are now used to seeing in movies.  It's a timeless treasure.  We are looking forward to watching again this weekend.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|what an amazing FAOTD! i've wanted to try a remote desktop client ever since i got my (original) kindle fire, but i didn't really NEED one so i was never willing to shell out the big bucks. plus, i could never quite believe that these things worked. but this one does!<br /><br />i had a bit of trouble getting the host software installed on my mac &amp; had to run the installer a couple times to get it done. it would find an update during the installation, and ask me if i wanted the update, and then hang while installing it. but it finally worked. then when i opened jump desktop, i had trouble finding its icon in the menu bar, because it's gray and it blended in with the background. but once i found it, everything was smooth sailing from then on.<br /><br />i have experienced zero problems running this on my kindle. it will wake my mac from sleep, which is essential. now i can run my mac from my bed! i have yet to try this when i'm away from home though. i guess that will be the real test of its worthiness.<br /><br />the only feature that's lacking in this app (so far as i can tell) is the ability to stream sound. so i can't play music or videos on it, although the videos do play. i just can't hear them. i assume that sound would slow everything down a lot. i don't know if splashtop or any other remote clients can do sound.<br /><br />i used gmail to connect and it was very simple &amp; easy. now i just have to be really careful not to lose my kindle, because the app remembers my mac's password. but i was being careful already, and so far so good.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I loved it. It woke me when I put it to 6:30 am so I can go to school early.
B001XUPGLY|3.0|Not as good at 40 plus as it was when I was 12.<br /><br />My boys enjoyed it though.<br /><br />The theme/moral was OK I guess, \\"save the whales, you never know when they might save you in the future.\\"<br /><br />Your basic good triumphs over evil, but with a lot of praise for humanistic (alienistic?) self perseverance.  Typical of Roddenberry's genre, so at least Nimoy (director) stuck to that routine.<br /><br />But, boy, have special effects and makeup come a long way since the eighties.  Talk about kitschy stuff.  Except, I gotta give Kirk's hair piece 5 stars, especially during the underwater swim scene.  It looked better than an ad for Hair Club For Men!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|great game for those who like military themes.  this game also takes a little patience.  overall this is a great strategy game with great graphics.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|I love Star Wars and I love dumb pinball games.  I don't know what it is about these pinball games, but I'm crazy about them.  But adding a Star Wars theme to them...  Ahhh, this is fantastic.<br /><br />They really did a great job with the Star Wars story.  There are plenty of audio clips from the games that are fun.  Even better than that is the way the weave the story into the game. There are different scenes where Darth Vader or storm troopers interact with the gameplay.  When you unlock certain levels, various ships will fly into the game and interact with the board.  There are even unlockable minigames, like a training level where you are Luke learning to use a light saber.<br /><br />I didn't think I'd love this game so much, but it really is fantastic.  Plug in your earbuds, turn up the sound, and give it a try.
B009AMANBA|3.0|LINCOLN is a film with brilliant performances, flawless art design, a stilted script, and an unimpressive plot.  It is akin to looking at dead flowers pressed in a book for two and a half hours.<br /><br />Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865) is arguably the greatest of the American presidents, but you get little sense of that from this 2012 Steven Spielberg film, which focuses very narrowly on the presidents determination to shepherd the thirteenth amendment through a polarized House of Representatives and thereby abolish slavery in the United States.  In consequence, the film consists of an endless array of political plots and counterplots, back room arm twisting, public bickering--most of it presented with a lack of interest that renders the film increasingly tedious.<br /><br />If the great failings are the script and direction, the great successes are in the performances.  The sparkling highlight of the film is a very unexpected performance by Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln.  I never questioned her performance, and although her screen time is limited, she conveys the complexities of this most complicated of first ladies beyond any possible skepticism.  In watching her performance, you never think of Sally Field playing Mary Todd Lincoln; you only think of Mary Todd Lincoln.  It is an astonishing achievement.  In contrast, the script significantly underserves Daniel Day-Lewis.  Although he has considerably more screen time than Field, he seems less complex than one expects, and while I never questioned his performance I often wished it had more scope.  The same is largely true of the rest of the cast, who seem hemmed in the constraints of the \\"let's pass the thirteenth amendment\\" story.<br /><br />In addition to its performances, the film is remarkable in terms of art direction.  It possesses an attention to visual detail that few other films have, from Mary Todd Lincoln's jet jewelry to Abraham Lincoln's inevitably unruly hair.  From fire light to candle light, from horse and buggy to battle weapons, you really feel that this is how it looked and sounded.  Unfortunately, this attention to detail is quite frequently undercut by the script, which has an unfortunate way of alternating between speech that sounds correct for 1865 and speech that sounds more like 2012.  It is an awkward amalgamation.  As for historical inaccuracy, I leave the battle to the experts--and, quite typically, none of them really agree.<br /><br />Bonuses depend on what version of the DVD you purchase.  The single disk version offers a making of documentary that is worth watching, but nothing more.  The elements are pristine.  But in the end, one has to ask: is this movie really worth watching?  My answer to that would be yes, but it is qualified yes.  It is a movie worth watching, certainly, but not necessarily a movie worth re-watching.  You may prefer to rent it than own it, for one viewing will likely be enough.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerorse and buggy to battle weapons, you really feel that this is how it looked and sounded.

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|My granddaughter and I enjoyed this game Immensely. When I came home from work each day she would come running saying Grammy  can we play the spooky game today.  This game was worth the money.
1616615362|5.0|This is such a great little model, and I love the fact it stands up &#34;correctly&#34;.  Even if I don't play the game, this little guy might just end up sitting on my desk to be gazed at longingly while I work.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I really like this app. It is convenient to have. Easy to use. They up date it all the time so it gets better and better.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Interesting game. Quality of the pieces is fair enough. Had to buy it cause i had the brazilian version and bought the english expansions and the borders of the board wouldn't fit each other.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Another fantastic thriller.I couldn't put it down. It was riveting from the start to the finish, typical of this author.
B005LAIHR2|3.0|It's a well done movie, and Tom Cruise is in it more than I thought he was gonna be, which is a good thing. Everyone else in the film did a good job.
B00006690G|5.0|I was introduced to the world of rap with this album. I became a fan of Rap after listening to this album. Hands down this is the best album I have ever heard. This is not too hardcore or hip-hop but eminem's lyrics are awesome and his music mixed with this rhyming lyrics makes it the best album.
B009CVAUIU|3.0|I read this book because it won the Pulitzer Prize. I wouldn't normally be attracted to a fiction book about North Korea written by an American. I found the writing style good and surprisingly easy to follow considering all the narrative transitions. However, I don't really know what to make of this novel.<br /><br />There is near constant brutality, torture, misery, and evil. There is so much of it that it gets kind of ridiculous. For example, in one place not only do the prisoners have to dig for wild radishes growing just beyond the fence, we're told the biggest radishes are the ones growing over the bodies of dead prisoners. There is a lot of overkill.  Also, apparently the entire country of North Korea is populated by sociopaths that might have turned out good had they not been subject to the horrors of Kim Jong Il.<br /><br />I confess, I don't know a lot about daily living in North Korea, but I just have my doubts about this novel. I think there is something missing or off from my experience of the book. I can't see the quality in it that earned the admiration of the Pulitzer committee.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I love this entire series. I teach eighth grade reading and my students told me I needed to read this book in the series. The reader really gets to know the characters as they evolve and there Is enough mystery to keep you reading but not So much that you want to put it down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very awesome fun and exciting game. The best part is that it doesn't get<br />boring because every month of so there is a free upgrade to a new city, more characters, and boards. Very, very addicting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really fun game that is aorta like temple run but k think it is a more fun game then.temple run I highly reccimend it and it is free it will have hours of gameplay......
B008RKGF1I|5.0|I think Jessica Biel is awesome.  Just an entertaining movie with great dancing and a silly story line.  Seen it many times and still like it.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I enjoyed watching it. Had some good funny moments. Good acting and decent script. Good but not great. Glad I rented it.
B00BF11STU|3.0|Love the military, totally respect that people are ordered to do things that outsiders will never comprehend - but movie felt &#34;forced&#34;, not as free flowing as I had hoped...  The movie did a great job of addressing news stories and rumors: even things remain unanswered...
B0051SDM5Q|4.0|However it helps you to focus on the simple triggers that put you on the back foot. When you can consciously see what is happening, it is easier to avoid the trap.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|This was a visually stunning movie - the clarity of the moon sequences was a total shock!!!! The story itself felt &#34;forced&#34; - but otherwise a good wrap up to the many plot and cliff hangers.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Gabaldon has amazing talent. She can balance the fantasy so well, and in real English! ( well, Scottish, primarily).<br />These books just keep on flowing, growing and keep us wanting more. The entire series should not be missed.
B004SKJTY6|5.0|This is one of those movies that comes out of left field and totally takes your breath away: great acting, good story, fantastic directing....
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|It's a great game but gees it gets you good with the dang peanuts.  i wish they did a little better so you can accomplish more instead of being stuck waiting for coins.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This is a great app that uses spatial matching in a time sensitive environment.  As each level progresses, it gets harder to collect the items needed before running out of time.  This makes for fast gameplay and some strategy requirements.  Great game Playrix!!
B0041D843M|5.0|Proof is in the science. It's hard to make such a change, but this book will motivate you beyond belief.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Learned new information on Lincoln - really good movie,  I can see why it was nominated for Academy Awards.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching movies at home.
B008Y6TD5A|4.0|Russell Crowe amazes me in most of his films and this was no different.  He's an incredible actor with an interesting character in a desperate situation..
B007SGM084|5.0|Heart pounding, mind blowing, and way beyond fabulous! I couldn't put it down until I finished all three books! Thank you E L James!
B0094K1WZE|4.0|I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan, but his Mission Impossible movies are hard for me to pass up.  They are always full of high technology and extreme, and sometimes impossible action.
B0082SU98U|5.0|Nicely written for the times.  A bit of rambling for Pollyanna but with a great story behind behind the story.  I would recommend this to others that enjoy light hearted reading.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Can't believe an app this good is free! I highly recommend it. It is very handy for everyday use, and the large buttons are a definite plus!
B00000I07P|5.0|I had to buy a new copy of one of my Bon Jovi faves cause the old one was too beat up!

B00BUCW54Q|4.0|I'm a Tom Cruise fan and for an action flick this did not disappoint. It wasn't a great movie, but it is worth renting.
B00005LOUP|5.0|A must see at Christmas time. The family loves to sit around the den at Christmas time and watch Christmas movies. This is one of our favorite.
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|Excellent, original entertaining story with strong characters. The world it is set in is original and asks for more exploration.
1433537427|5.0|If you're worried about font size, it's really not a big deal. Lots of awesome material in a convenient size. I'm very happy with it.
B00786XVOG|5.0|The Yanni experience is always thrilling. I play his music in my car while travelling. It is soothing at times and  invigorating  at times thus providing a perfect driving experience.
B005EWDA3I|5.0|As good as the two first books! I loved this new world and the characters. I definitely recommend it! Enjoy.
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|This is a great album Stone Sour has never sounded. Better they are very creative lyrical wise and the music just falls along with it
B007704HO6|5.0|A friend recommended this book and it was the first one I read on my Kindle. I enjoyed the story, even if the writing is simple it touched me, especially because it is a real story.
B007CFQITI|5.0|The book was a interesting story in comic form, my professor had picked for his course. The person I recieved it from kept it in good quality.
B008HVMQ4W|3.0|I have always wanted to read this following watching the seies.  It follows the series faithfully and reads like a screenplay.  I was very disappointed with the ending and left wandering what had happened to the characters
1416972250|5.0|All of the books in this series are a great read.  Couldn't put them down!  Enjoyed them just as much as Ms. Meyer's collected works.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Although the pace was slow, Argo was interesting, informative, and the cast was perfect. Affleck did justice to the story.
1416972242|5.0|All of the books in this series are a GREAT read.  Loved this as much as Ms. Meyer's collected works.  Couldn't put them down!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Thanks for the fix George. Feast of Crows has a few issues, but overall it's a good read. The only thing keeping it from having a 5 rating are some stylistic differences from his previous work.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Sometimes too slow for me.  however it could be the operator!!!<br />Patience is a virtue they say.  I'll keep trying
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Alright, so George really hits his stride in SoS. It's twisty, it's heart breaking, it's full of dragons. Two thumbs up
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Fun to play very entertaining spent too much time on to just a bit addictive. Different levels of play keep interesting.  Application has shown no issues.
1846573785|1.0|I heard that 50 Shades Of Gray was a good book, and thought it might be entertaining to listen to on my commute to and from work - so I wanted to enjoy the audio book version, I really did.  The story from a distance is mildly intriguing, but the writing itself I found to be unimaginative and repetitive - how many times can one reuse the word 'gaze' 'lips' 'frown' 'holy crap!' 'stare' 'blush'.  Misuse of words is everywhere in this book!  To boot, the reader's extremely limited range of tone and acting ability also ruined the characters for me.  She spoke in classic 'valley girl' with a lot of unwarranted huffing and puffing that made her sound more like a temperamental teenager than the dynamic, clever, humble and studious character that the author seemed to have intended. If I had known then what I know now, I would have never tainted my experience of this story by listening to the audiobook.  I advise others to steer clear of this version, and go for the read.  You'll likely get a lot more out of it.

I'm going to be brief, particularly where the 9th is concerned, if only due to the missing (?) last movement.<br /><br />Happily, Paavo Jarvi, as it happens sticks to the Cohrs three movement edition, and to my mind that's enough linkage to the Almighty.<br /><br />Jarvi, his wonderful Frankfurt orchestra, and the excellent SACD production do themselves proud.

B00CL0J99K|5.0|This is the first of the summer action films and it was not what I was expecting. It was a fast-paced action film with a reasonable sense of humor and a decent plot. As usual Robert Downey Jr, carries the film on his personality and charisma. Gwyneth Paltrow does a wonderful job in a supporting role. They even figure out something useful to do with the character of Happy Hogan. I didn't know what to expect when Ben Kingsley was cast in this thing, but they figured out the perfect role for him. Don Cheadle was also used in a very effective way. The characters all had roles to play in the overall story. None of them stayed too long and their roles in the script were exactly suited to their characters. That I think is the most impressive thing about the writing.<br /><br />The film was directed by Shane \\"Lethal Weapon\\" Black. Its full of all his usual bits. But it seems fresh because its been a long time since he has done them and he is doing them in a different sort of context. Some moments feel very lethal weapon-ish (the gunplay, the buddy banter, the comedy) but I doubt most of the audience would notice. Black's strength is that he managed to bring out the character and human elements from the material in a way that was complementary to the action sequences.<br /><br />The best part about the script is that rolls out an interesting plot with a fair bit of mystery to it and delivers something worth all the build-up. The only negative is that certain aspects of the plot are *very* 2005. Certain points being made just seem kind of dated or cliche. There were simple way that the same ground could have been covered in a more up to date way. But the film moves so fast over them that it doesn't really matter much.<br /><br />Within its genre, its a really good film. Its pure action and character with excellent writing complemented by a first-rate cast. I would never have thought after what is now four films that Robert Downey Jr could be carrying this material so effectively. It should be tired and played out but it seems to just get better.

1451695195|3.0|I enjoyed reading about his experiences in heaven, but all the medical terms were he wrote were a little over my head.  I did enjoy him sharing his families faith and their experiences when he was in a coma.
1582406634|3.0|It seems to follow the most of the comments here it is pretty good but just seems to be similar to everything else he has already been doing.

0671449028|4.0|My daughter likes this book, but it hasn't been as engaging as the other Sandra Boyton books. I guess every kid takes to books differently. As a parent, I loved reading it.
145210655X|5.0|Got this as a gift from my brothers the year my daughter was born. The book is way cute. The art is adorable, the in-jokes are fun, and the humor is more sharp than not. Of course there are a few dud pages, but well worth owning for any Star Wars parent. It's all that much better now that I have a son to go with the daughter.
B0084IG8TM|3.0|well at least I wasn,t with watching this dvd,a bit slow and took a bit to get into the story.Quite a reasonable dvd to watch with family,but personally I didn,t think it stood up to the hype that I had heard about it...
B00C9G22R2|2.0|Before you read my review, know that i am a foreign movie fanatic and own hundreds of them.<br /><br />The picture quality was bad and looked bootlegg. The subtitles were too fast, not accurate and didn't fit on the screen so you couldn't read everything that was being said, which made the movie very hard to follow. Due to the fact that it was hard to follow, the story didn't make a lot of sense and it seemed like there were missing parts. There was very little action and most of the fight scenes were in slow motion to hide the poor choreography. The music was good and original language spoken by the actors was well done but overall i wouldn't recommend this dvd. Maybe i would enjoy this more on Blu Ray with better visuals and better sub titles.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|I was spellbound with this touching story and really enjoyed the dvd...would recommend this as a very good rainy day dvd to chill out with..
B007RCJNDE|5.0|This is the awesomest. I have a weird thing where I cry when I'm happy or proud. Or when I'm walking along, and someone drops five euro in front of me, and before I can pick it up someone swoops in and dashes after the person who dropped it and then hands it back to them with a proud little smile.<br />Well I cried my way through this book like a little girl. Everyone I'd loved all the way through transformed from being my fictional friends to gods. It is the best conclusion to the series that I could have imagined. Kudos to Mr. Sanderson, I don't think I have been this addicted to a book since I was a child.<br />If you have read the others, don't hesitate, buy and read this.<br />If you haven't, buy the others, read them, then buy this one and read it, and be happy.
076421120X|4.0|Bethany House also provided me with the opportunity to review Darlene Zschech's 365-Day Devotional Revealing Jesus. I was excited to dig into this book, having been a fan of Darlene's music since my high school days.<br /><br />Being a new mom, I find it hard to have a long period of time to sit down for my devotions each day. Instead I find my self with 5 minutes here and another 10 minutes there. This book provided the excellent solution - little nuggets of truth and Scripture to get me through these tough days and long nights.<br /><br />I've placed this book and other short devotionals beside the chair where I feed my son. During those middle of the night feedings, the Lord has used this book to encourage and challenge me.

B006BQNJR8|2.0|Sorry but you just can't remake a GREAT movie in my opinion. This Conan looks like he would've fit in better with Pirates at Disneyland
B00CH87HF4|5.0|As all to the titles from Gameloft, I found Dungeon Hunter 4 to be well thought out. The control layout is great, the enemies are good and the.backgrounds work. The only thing I might change or add would be alternative source of gems.

0547848412|5.0|the reviews said the book would make you a believer in God. Well I was already a believer, before I bought the book but I was interested. I felt for reviewers to make such a claim the book must be good and it was. It is filled with action and moments where you might say gross, like when the boy got so hungry he ate tiger shit, but the book has so much drama in it you won't mind a few gross moments.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun! I've never done it before but I like it better than temple run or any other games. I love the different versions. Thanks for making this game so fun!! :):):):) <3
B0041C09Y0|2.0|So, it's a show about a dreamy-cute motorcycle gangster with a heart of gold.  Really?  Come on.  I could only watch about half an hour of the pilot before I groaned and stopped the stream, angry and feeling like I'd been suckered.  This show just glorifies some very simplified version of rebellion.  The characters are not thoroughly hashed out three-dimensional people.  They are recycled versions of stereotypical filler characters from thousands of mediocre movies nobody can remember the names of.  It's the kind of show where you know there were good intentions, but the execution just didn't pan out.  In every scene, you can see the thinking that went into its making.  \\"Okay, we need to show everyone that motorcycle gangsters are not just pure hellions.  They have feelings, too.\\"  Great.  But then in doing everything they can to show us these guys are not the simple stereotypical hell-raisers we expect them to be, they become some other stereotypical character that is even less life-like.  If you want to create a good story and quality characters, you can't be so heavy-handed.  It has to flow naturally.  Sorry, this show just doesn't work.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I am a 'Les Mis-aholic'.  I have all the other movies or DVD's that have come out and this one did not disappoint either.  People I know who have seen this found the singing instead of spoken dialogue a bit annoying but this is true to the other versions in the story and actually clarifies a number of situations that I was not clear about before. It was just as I expected it to be
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is awesome the details are great the characters are amazing the plot is amazing .I love Suzanne collins

B006ATJXQW|5.0|I love this book and it answers so many questions about the fl i can't say i might spoil a wonderful book
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wary about reading it, but found myself racing through it as I couldn't out it down, some gore but considering the overall story, I wouldn't expect less.  I don't do trilogy books but this series MIT be an exception.  Good read!
B0092ZEIN4|4.0|Only problem is that the left and right triggers aren't able to be mapped. Everything else works great. Suits my gameboy needs just fine.

B005GSZZ1A|3.0|This is a moving and unbelievable story of the human spirit and the ability to overcome insurmountable odds. Shin's story is shocking and memorable. Reading this makes one wonder how this secret about north Korea is still being kept in this day and age. A modern day Hitler that has no immediate as threat.
B0067R0APK|4.0|Needs white on black theme. Would be nice if you could customize more than do yourself projects. Wind direction for fishing.  Cloud cover for Astronomy etc.

B009R659L8|5.0|Another good book by Mary HIggins Clarks.  She has become my number one favorite author.  This one definitely doesn't disappoint.  Cannot wait for the next.<br /><br />Glad to see Amazon starting to carry her books and the books by Carol Higgins Clarks too.  Both excellent!!
B004SIP9RO|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies now and am glad I purchased it!  Have watched twice already since I got it.
0061251321|4.0|Tribal Leadership is as much about learning a new language to give voice to what you see going on in your organization as it is a &#34;how to&#34; on building strong tribes.<br /><br />The storytelling is engaging and reflects what we see in the world but perhaps didn't know how to give a voice to.<br /><br />I highly recommend it for leaders and non-leaders alike.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|What a great documentary!  What a great story!  A tale of a 70's singer-songwriter superstar named Sixto Rodriguez who actually had no clue he was a superstar.  I think what makes this film so great to me is how calm and cool Rodriguez actually is throughout the entire span of events which is around 40 years.  He's a very genuine person who takes everything that happens to him in stride.  And his music is actually quite amazing too!  I ended up buying the movie from Amazon and saw Rodriguez - Cold Fact in my local record store and picked that up too!
0142001104|5.0|The Art of Possibility gets more delightful each time I read a piece of it and laugh again at the stories and ideas presented by Ben and Rosamund Zander.<br /><br />It will rub your fur the wrong way at first. Parts of it seem utopian and airy-fairy, happy-clappy, &#34;I'd like to teach the world to sing&#34; and &#34;all we need is love&#34; solutions to what ails us. Keep reading. Read it again, and go back and read it yet again. Even if in the end your cynical heart can't quite agree with what's been posited, you'll be the better for having read it.<br /><br />A magical book that's changed the way I view the future. And perhaps how you'll view the future, and today, as well.
B00BGGD1J4|5.0|What can I say other than I love Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats!  I have waited for this one for  a year and it does not disappoint!  If Uncle Acid had a cult...I would join it.  Crazy Sabotage era Sabbath tones, always a concept or two going on within each record/song, occult madness and late night flickering TV hypnotic awesomeness!
1408806592|4.0|I've heard so many great things about John Green, he's like the King of YA. When I had the chance to read one of his books, I choose Paper Towns mainly because I thought the cover was interesting.<br /><br />I now understand why everyone seems to love his books. He has a way to create realistic characters and tell a story without boring you once. In Paper Towns, Quentin is just a normal boy living his normal life until Margo, the girl he has been always in love, open his window and ask him to help her with her revenge.<br /><br />Quentin is exactly like a teenage boy, I really liked him and enjoyed reading about him growing up and daring to do more with his life. But Margo is a mystery, she's an intelligent girl, popular but bored with her life. I understand why she decided to just go away, but I don't really think it was an intelligent choice. Disappearing and leaving everyone was not only selfish but even dangerous. Also, I think I missed something in the ending. After all that went through, is it going to end that way?<br /><br />But it was fun to read about Orlando, specially since I have been there and remembered a lot about the streets, parks, etc. (BTW, I don't think everything the stores sell there is junk, maybe because we don't have that kind of junk here!)<br /><br />Overall, Paper Towns is definitely worth reading and I want to read more books from John Green. Quentin is one of my favorite male characters in YA, and even when Margo wasn't my favorite, I can relate to her desire for a different life.

1577314808|3.0|The content of the book  is beyond my expectations. It entails some very global truths. However, I bought this book second hand and did not expect highlighted sections and notes in the margins all over the book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I would say this is the best game on my kindle HD. You get to build and create anything you want. I give this game 5 stars
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I am a fan of Kathy Reichs' books.  I have read them all.  This particular book, however, had a little too much technical information in it for my taste.  The story line itself was interesting.  I could speed read through the many pages of scientific information without changing the  plot one iota. I did like her dry sense of humor and I liked the way the story ended.
B000H3096A|5.0|I love this album. It is at the node, the departure point for Hutcherson just before he became known and recorded by Blue Note for the New York avant guard. I've always loved the silver crystalline sound of the vibes, and here on this CD Bobby chooses a perfect rhythm section---Herbie Hancock on acoustic piano, Joe Chambers on drums, and a badly remastered or recorded Bob Cranshaw on bass, which makes him sound like he's slappin' plywood. The bass sound notwithstanding, the album has some great tunes (2 top rate ballads by Hutcherson, 2 up-tempo swingers, a cover of \\"Maiden Voyage\\",a Latin bossa-boogaloo tune,  and a slightly outside piece \\"The Omen\\"). The remaster captures that mellow diffuse shimmery feel of the vibes, the aural equivalent of a slightly hazy seascape.  There's a lot of interior work of interest by Hutcherson, Hancock, and Chambers, and I just know this CD is gonna grow on me over time.
B00BHXUC8E|4.0|I'll try to keep this brief - if you want to see the \\"new\\" Whitesnake on DVD, stick to Live: In the Still of the Night. It may be almost 10-years-old now, but it's one of the greatest testaments of why Whitesnake is such a great band.<br /><br />The current Made In Japan Double CD/DVD issue is frankly a little disappointing.<br /><br />First, the DVD: - it's a little dark, the stage lighting isn't very impressive. Other than that, it has good camera work and the overall quality is good. The show is a little bit on the short side, but what can you do...David is not 30 anymore.<br /><br />The Two Audio CDs:<br />- as others have noted, the volume is turned up quite high on the first CD. I can barely stand listening to it in the car. It just doesn't sound very clear - just shouty and boomy (and no, it's not my car's stereo - the Forevermore CD sounds terrific in there).<br />- tracklisting - this is all a matter of personal preference, but I still don't think Best Years is a very good opening track (or a Whitesnake track altogether). But the biggest problem by far is...the drum solo! It's okay on the DVD, I can live with it, but why do bands insist on releasing drum solos on Audio CDs. Back in the day, the only ones I liked were Cozy Powell's because they were musical, had a backing track to them. This is just some dude banging on drums for 6 minutes (in an already rather short setlist). Can anyone honestly say that they are going to listen to a 6 minute drum solo on their daily commute in their car? I don't think so. No offense to Brian Tichy - I really like him as a drummer, I just don't understand why the drum solo should be on an official release.<br />- CD 2 is probably my favorite - the acoustic tracks rock. I think along with Forevermore from the first disc, they are the best tracks on this release.<br /><br />In the end, I bought the Deluxe Package and I don't regret it because I like to support David Coverdale - he is one of my all-time heroes and a genuinelynice guy. But if you are not such a big fan, consider this: the MP3 version here on Amazon is only $6.99 (at the moment at least) for both Audio CD. For such a price, this is a steal. I recommend it - you will definitely find tracks that you will like. Others (like the drum solo) you can just delete.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|and the first was great.  It gets deeper, more intense, more integrated.  It breezes by occasional moments of implausibility, melodrama, a ludicrous plot twist here and there.

1435140745|3.0|I've had been hoping for a leather bound edition of Dune ot be published (that was affordable) for quite some time now, and finally, here it is. Was it worth the wait? Yes.<br />This is a nicely put together edition, though there are a few editting errors here and there (three I can think of off the top of my head) and any fan of the Dune series, I think, would be pleased with having a copy.<br /><br />The story itself is well written and it is clear that Frank Herbert took great pains into the creation of his universe and the concepts behind the spice and worms, the Empire and the Fremen, the Guild and space travel, and the rivalry and intrigues between the Houses Atreides and Harkonnen.<br /><br />*** Possible Spoilers Beyond ***<br /><br />Unfortunately, the end was rather anti-climatic. Yes, there was a big battle at the end, but all the Baron Harkonnen's plans fell flat and there was not struggle of any sort between him and Paul Atreides. I wanted to see Paul counter the Baron's treachery, not have the emperor come in and squash everything.<br /><br />Also, the last fight with Feyd-Rautha, and the threat to Paul seemed forced and exaggerated. Up to that point, Paul had become Maud'Dib, the uncontested top fighter of the entire Fremen people, who themselves were the best fighters in all that universe. Feyd-Rautha, though a decent fighter, fought nothing more than drugged slaves. An Atreides common soldier nearly took him down. Paul should have been able to dispatch him with barely any effort, yet everyone was afraid for him. Why?<br /><br />Another thing that greatly lessened Paul's character (apart from his coldness) was his need to know what the future held before he was willing to make any decision. (Not to mention the arrogance in that he felt he should be making decisions about the fate of teh entire human race.) \\"Dune\\" has often been called \\"The Lord of the Rings of Sci-Fi\\", and to a degree, I agree, with regards to the richness and depth of the world created. The characters, however, are sorely lacking when compared to LOTR. The heroes of that saga never faltered in doing what was right, regardless of whether or not they thought they could succeed. But then, LOTR was intended to show the virtue of heroes, while the Dune saga aims to rip heroes down. (A theme seen more clearly as the series progresses. I'd personnally advise, if you wish to read more, to end at \\"Children of Dune\\".)<br /><br />Final thought, in keeping to the LOTR comparison, no character in Dune would have ever thought to destroy the Ring.<br /><br />Personally, I think the story would have been more enjoyable if Paul had more of his Father Leto's compassion and value for his men and was more confident. I'd rather see him confident in his values rather than trying to follow some perfect future he is trying to (literally) envision.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I gave it 2 stars, but I probably should have given it only one.  I think I am just too hard up for a decent movie to watch so I settled for trash.  I thought it was unnecessarily raunchy.  I am 40. But, thankfully I couldn't relate to these people at all.  They were way too immature and irresponsible.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Highly recommended. Everyone else wviewing had a positive feeling as well. Both male actors and the rest of the cast were flawless.
B000SW2F8K|3.0|Entertaining and cute story but low budget and kind of cheesy.  The story line was unique, not the same old ROMCOM.
0385535147|3.0|I did not like this book as well as John Grisham's other novels mostly because I could not identify with the main character; he turned out to be a sleazy character.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A great read......  I absolutely could not put it down.  I plan to search for more of Mr Weir's books.
034580404X|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when buying this book except for the reviews I had already heard. I really thought it was going to be a lot more crazy erotic like everyone was saying but instead it was so much better... The book (s) captured me and I read them faster than I thought I ever could. It wasn't all about the erotic moments it was more about the story and the characters in it. I fell in love with them and kept wanting to know what happened  next.I would recommend this trilogy :-)
B000I8G5B2|2.0|The picture was out of focus and the sound quality so poor it was impossible to make out the dialog.  Come on Amazon! You can do much better than this! I own this movie on DVD and the movie is excellent, but this digital version is not usable.<br />____________________<br />Update: The comments above referred to use with a digital projector.  When I later tried it with my Kindle Fire, it was veiwable.
B00A1EOBJQ|1.0|I love the show but the cd sucks. I wish I could return it. The music doesn't sound professional or good.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool is an intriguing story that I couldn't put down.  Can't  wait to see what happens in the other silos.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|One of the best bbc shows, hated to reach the end! Even my husband loved it. We got very wrapped up in the story.
B005PK553C|5.0|this show is awesome the acting is top notch the writting is even better would never miss an episode<br />great
0399536108|5.0|According to my Amazon account, I purchased this book back in December 2010. Life was pretty chaotic back then and even though I really wanted to read it, I just got around to reading it this week. I wish I would have read it sooner! It's probably the best book I've ever read about entrepreneurship and living the life of fulfillment that you desire. I've always known I wanted to be self-employed, why I wanted to do it, and have had marginal successes (so far). I just never knew how to put into words why I had that desire. This describes me nearly perfectly.<br /><br />If you're \\"stuck\\" in a career path that isn't fulfilling or already an entrepreneur that could use some inspiration and guidance, you HAVE to read this book! If you're willing to let it, it could change your life!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|How do you not love this movie franchise tommy lee jones is one of the greatest actors ever good story
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I am really enjoying this game but easy to finish the last level. Hopthis game has more levels to defeat..
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Enjoyed it gets a litttle dopey some times but all and all entertaining enough for a plane flight or just to kill time
B003UESJF6|5.0|I came across this movie on television and absolutely loved the idea behind the story. It's different from the usual story lines out there. I saw part of it with my mother and she too liked it. I'm giving it to her as a mother's day gift instead of something ordinary as flowers. If you're looking to this movie for your children I would recommend it.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|it was ok the original was much better al and all it was just ok would not have wanted to see in theater
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|Not really fair that Bradley Cooper is that good looking, and that good of actor. Just amazing film with more to see than just the love story. Must see!
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|never got to watch it before rental time expired so i guess i will never know if i liked it or not
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Ever since SciFi started airing these episodes my husband and I have been catching every episode we can find.  It was so nice to find the entire series at our disposal in order.  This is such a thought provoking, interesting, mind bending...and even funny at times...drama...it's hard to pick a favorite character, but I'd probably have to say Walter.
B006LKY1A8|5.0|Good movie, watched it quite a few times and even looked up the guy Depp was playing.  Great movie.  You should watch it.
B00932A4XE|3.0|I mainly watched the movie because knowing so many stars in it are popular, I figured it would be very good.  It was a cute movie, not life changing or anything for me.
B000EWBKK8|5.0|i Loved it and since it was based on whats happening today I give it five star rating, believe me people this was taken from an actual true story.
B007Z9QWVK|3.0|It was ok. I thought it weird how they portrayed Wally's infatuation with Wallis Simpson. It was very odd.  I felt as though the story itself was lacking real substance. I will say Abbie Cornish and Andrea Riseborough are fantastic actors.
0142406112|4.0|i read this series in highschool figured my little brother would like it he hated it but i read it again its a good read came in escelent condition
1476715904|5.0|I was so badly hoping Lake and Will would end up together in the end. Beautifully written story. I have never been a fan of poetry but I loved Slam night and they way Will writes his poetry. Such a great story!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|This app will NOT accept the bonus point games that have been sent by another player OR begun on a different platform! Instead an error message appears that cannot be corrected.<br /><br />I have not found a workaround for the error message: Too many controls added to LayoutManager. This problem has existed for at least 2 years . . . why hasn't Zynga/OMGPOP fixed it? I am not pleased!<br /><br />In addition, because the app will not play its movie offers on the Fire, everything just goes dead after a game and the player is forced to return to Home on the Fire AND turn off the screen. Only then can the screen be turned on again, the app opened yet AGAIN, and a new game opened. Sheesh people!<br /><br />Huh! Aside from all that, the game itself is challenging and fun. I have enjoyed playing with family members.<br /><br />*6/8/2013: edit to add second complaint!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Awesome game...loved it!! Keeps you thinking clear until the end! Worth every penny! Can't wait for the next one and hoping for many more!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I have read the whole wot series and I think Brandon Sanderson did a good job wrapping up a lot of loose ends and answering a lot of questions. I enjoyed the book but could have lived without the over and over battle scenes.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|very easy to use, not complicated, no crazy add ons, doesnt randomly quit, i use it for school and homework
B002VKE1K2|3.0|Since there's so much hype about this movie, I decided to finally buy and watch it.  I thought it was for the most part creepy at times. A lot of suspense building up to the end of the movie.  That's where I thought it could of been better. The ending didn't 'wow' me like i thought it would.  If the movie was more shocking overall,  it may have been a classic..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is totally Awsome! I love the current &quot;World Tour&quot; feature. If you haven't downloaded this game yet, do it now! NOW!
B00821OX98|3.0|Interesting show. I'm not a big tv watcher but this show always makes you want to see the next episode. I guess I'm drawn to the human compassion and coping issues this show portrays.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|If this film was an attempt to revive movie musicals, it is a dismal failure.  Either the original Schonberg score from the play is awful, or the movie adaption destroyed it.  Most of the songs are simply torturous to listen to - done an octave too high, and by actors without that kind of vocal range.  The real shame of the film is Anne Hathaway, whose remarkable voice and natural singing talents are wasted by the tedious, uninspired score in this film.<br /><br />The movie opens with a promising scene and stirring music that depicts French prisoners in a surrealistic image pulling on huge ropes to hand-winch a damaged ship of war into a dry dock, with a song that captures the despair and yet strong spirit of the prisoners.  Unfortunately, those brief opening moments are the highpoint of the entire musical, as Schonberg scores most of the remaining 2 and a half hours of music in high soprano register, and the score rapidly deteriorates into one evoking fingernails on chalkboard.  Listening to Russell Crow and Hugh Jackman trying to sing two registers too high is inhumane punishment that must have been banned by the Geneva Convention.  With the beginning of each new song, all I could do was wonder how long that particular torture was going to last.  Simply put, the music was unattractive and the singing simply high pitched screeching. After 10 minutes, it felt as if I had been strapped into a dentist's chair for 2 hours and 36 minutes of novocaine-free drilling.<br /><br />This \\"musical\\" deserves 0 stars as it is a setback to the entire musical genre.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The entire trilogy is worth the read!  Once I started I couldn't put it down.  Highly recommend reading all thee books.
0743270754|5.0|I learned so much more than I had known about the War Between the States and how Lincoln's thoughts on emancipation progressed. I am amazed at the blatant racism of respected Americans on both sides of the conflict.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is one of the best apps in the app store. I love the travel around the world thing it keeps me hooked to the game.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I love playing this game! Very fun. A great game for little moments when you are waiting. I love the variety of game play! Definitely not boring.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|love this series will be really sad when I get to the end of the show and have to wait for new episodes.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Amazing game! Uses concepts obviously inspired by Final Fantasy and the other great RPG series of the late eighties and early ninties to amazing affect, giving the game a feel that separates it from these forebearers.  Great story, believable dialouge, top notch gameplay, striking graphics, and a system making play after the game has been completed well worth it.  Also, the game can appeal to many gamers, not requiring a great deal of monotonous and unfullfilling grinding, but not being so fast paced it seems easy.  I spent 30+ hours on this game and loved every minute of it.  Worth every cent I paid and much more, which is rarely the case.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this version of Temple run even more than the first.  It is addictive, very fast, fun and a great way to waste a bit of time.  Also think it is pretty challenging.
B005POK858|5.0|I enjoyed this, even though it compatriots Symphony of Eternity and Grinsia are much better in several qualities.  For starters, it seemed like the story was overly fast, and in several points did not make sense.  Despite this, it had a difficult, bit rewarding, battle system that far exceeds any expectations I had.  However, the lack of variety the other games have made it feel sort of like it was droning.  Nonetheless, since these problems mostly went away by the game's middle, the fairly original robot theme, and the great gameplay make this game still worth the money and five stars.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|bought this movie for my wife she is a big lord of the rings fan ...me not so much....she is lookin forward to part 2
B004YRSBTW|5.0|This movie exemplifies why I love movies. Mainly because it is a movie that requires you to pay attention! And rewards upon subsequent viewings. Much is written about the technique of telling a story in reverse and how revolutionary that is. I instead love the story of an amnesiac so guilt/revenge ridden over the murder of his wife. Seeing this consume him. That is why I love this movie!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|great book. sad it is over though! can not wait to see if they end up making the movies or not!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|A very good game, entertaining, challenging, addictive. The game is easy to learn and start playing and it gets more difficult at the advanced levels. Additional features are introduced along the play.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|such a great book if you are new to erotic novels this is a great starter series. i cannot wait to read more.
140591243X|3.0|This book was well written (something that is lacking from a lot of other books in this genre), but lacked much in the way of &#34;spark&#34; or excitement.  It seems like Gabriel and Julia may have the most mundane illicit relationship ever.  My wife commented as we were reading, &#34;The conversation in this book is weird...nobody really talks that way in these situations&#34;.  I appreciated the allegorical attempts with Dante, but most of the references were above me (and I don't feel like I am uneducated), and frankly didn't really seem important.  Finally, if you are considering this book for titillating scenes like with Fifty Shades...don't bother.
B001NTJTUY|5.0|John Barry is probably most well-known for his contributions to many exciting James Bonds scores, but it is his work with romantic films such as \\"Out Of Africa\\" and \\"Somewhere In Time\\" that most speaks to the heart and soul. I remember buying this album when I was in high school back in the 80s, long after I'd fallen in love with the beautiful movie.<br /><br />There has long been a debate throughout the past thirty three years whether the movie itself is any good...for some of us, it's an absolutely amazing tear jerker that resonates with anyone who is in love with the idea of love. For others, it remains nothing but a corny flop from the 80s. What very few can argue with, however, is just how lovely the music itself is...in a sense, the true star of the film.<br /><br />Of most striking note is the famous and beloved \\"Rhapsody On A Theme of Paganini\\" by Rachmaninoff, a piece of music crucial to the plot of \\"Somewhere In Time\\" and the heart of the entire soundtrack of which John Barry steeps everything in lushness that is sincere and romantic without being overstated.<br /><br />Original John Barry compositions, such as \\"Nineteen Twelve\\" and \\"A Day Together,\\" narrate the film perfectly with soft anticipation as Richard Collier (Christopher Reeve) begins his quest and then finds the woman he loves. \\"The Man Of My Dreams,\\" playing while stage actress Elise McKenna (Jane Seymour) diverges from her soliloquy to quietly moon over her newfound feelings for Richard, is delightfully moving.<br /><br />The soundtrack as a whole does what every soundtrack should do but often doesn't: capture the spirit and essence of the movie that works both in and outside of it. It is perfect for reading to, but should never be dismissed as \\"just\\" background music. It is both subtle and powerful and the closest thing to how love sounds without anyone saying a word.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|If you don't get any other free games, get this one! Fun, challenging and consistently ups the challenge. I am hooked, I have it on my phone and my tablet!
B00821PCJS|4.0|I just think they should give more of apart to the military guy which escapes my name.  I like the professor actor, but feel that the acting is not shared and the other actor is Wonderfu.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|i came to play n theres a price to pay so tjme to get on ur knees n play hahahha jk but this game is the bomb diggity
0142407542|5.0|We collect J.D.'s books and also give them out as gifts.  The rhyming is wonderful, the illustrations are fun.  The kids (and adults) love them.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|First, let's establish as an avid reader, you almost NEVER see me without a book (Kindle). Therefore, as a lover of books I would like to acknowledge that the author's love of reading so deftly and honestly admitted in this novel, is what made the difference between this book being good and interesting...and what it is...RIVETING,POIGNANT, AND FULL OF EMOTION AND RICH HEARTRENDING DETAIL. I noted the number of stars on the review of this book and thought to myself...this many people CANNOT be wrong!!! They were right!!!  I don't like to write a review \\"retelling\\" the story. LOL! SO..... I found myself not wanting to put this book down and if I had to, I would rush back to it immediately as soon as a spare moment presented itself. The characters are unbelievably human and the plot twisting and turning enough to be classified as a \\" nailbiter\\", as the suspense of needing to know if your theories are right emerge just a few paragraphs further down...but you can' t bear to rush through the beautifully written words.Afraid to miss one unique idea or descriptive word. I am currently looking for more books by Diane Setterfield..I' m positive I won' t be let down!!!
B00BWJARHO|2.0|I was expecting so much more with this movie.  It actually got to a point where I started watching the clock wondering how much more could this go on for.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I'm leaving this because please don't waste your money hardly any hidden object game and it was over so quickly. I will have to say was fun to switch to different worlds and fugure out mini games but needs to be cheaper...
125000098X|5.0|I have been waiting for the release of this book and I am very impressed that I received my copy the day after it was released to the American public.  Thanks Amazon, great job.
B008X8P8A8|1.0|I was looking for a real war game not a mindless video arcade game. Seems none of the tablet app type game designers have ever played a real strategy game.
B000VNMMWA|5.0|Simon Pegg and Nick Frost reunite with Director Edgar Wright to make a very funny action film. Playing the role of the top cop Nicholas Angel, Simon really rises to the occasion, playing a very serious character who is very unlike his previous character of Shawn.<br /><br />When Nicholas gets transferred to the small village of Sandord, his seriousness and style doesn't endear him to the locals, with the exception of Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), who sees him as something of a role model.<br /><br />When a few people die in mysterious accidents, Angel doesn't buy it and finds a suspect in the owner of the local supermarket: Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton).<br /><br />From there, things get even more unusual, but the funny rarely stops except to carefully weave in serious moments as needed.<br /><br />Another star studded cast, though I knew only a few of them myself, it is a cast that works exceptionally well. There are also a number of movie references that make the film that much more enjoyable. The outtakes, deleted scenes, the commentary, and the Fuzzball Rally (a video of the American tour and interviews that Pegg, Frost, and Wright conducted) are very entertaining. The Fuzz track for captions gives the watcher fun facts about behind the scenes info as you watch the movie.<br /><br />All in all, I cannot recommend this movie enough.
B003QSLDTA|4.0|This is just a fun movie. You know the premise, mom and kid swap places. There is an older version, with Jodie Foster, and it is good, but this one is better. More fun. Jamie Lee Curtis steals the show, Lindsay Lohan was OK. It was kinda nice to see her before booze, etc. We are 50ish ;) but I would certainly watch this with kids if we still had any! We watched the older one first and this one the next night. It was fun to compare and even with the same story, we were not bored.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Actors Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (Shawn of the Dead, Hot Fuzz) play a pair of friends who go to Comiccon, after that, they head off in a rented RV to take a tour of various UFO related sites. They don't get far before an on the run from the government alien named Paul convinces them to give him a ride.<br /><br />The movie takes on a road trip feel, and is one funny moment after another. There are also a load of Easter egg moments with references to a ton of other movies that serve to only make it funnier.<br /><br />With a star studded cast, the movie really works and works well. I can't recommend it enough.
1401900526|5.0|Louise gives us a is perfect resource for busy lives.  I love how they lovingly remind us to remember who we really are.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|We watched this movie in the theatre and again watching in the tv was great. The clarity of the movie was very great. I would recommend everyone to watch this movie.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Is it me or does it take a few episodes for something 'big' to happen?  Definitely a slower pace than previous seasons, but the show is still fantastic, doing a great job of character development.  I just wish it didn't take 3 episodes to get through one event.
B00BIVN82M|3.0|I don't know what happened here, but this album is missing everything that made his previous works magnificent. From the forced, shallower, edgier vocals, weird arrangements, and a different song selection, this is just not my cup of bublé.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|Wanna score points with your wife or favorite gal?  Then see \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\".  There are enough elements in it to even keep the guys amused.  After all you've got Bradley Cooper of \\"Hangover\\" fame, a classic guy flick, plus the multi faceted Robert De Niro and Chris Rock as an added comic prop.  Cooper plays 30 something Pat Solitano, released to his parents care after being institutionalized for bipolar disorder.  His goal is to resume his marriage with his estranged wife, by showing her that he can become the kind of man she wants him to be.  The problem is, he has several restaining orders against him that inhibit the reunion.  By chance through a friend he meets Tiffany(cutely played by Jennifer Lawrence)who has her own hangup of sex addiction.  They agree to help each other overcome their disorders as Tiffany is a link to Pats' reunion with his wife.  What insues are various degrees of comical mishaps that conclude in a big payoff for Pat and Tiffany, as well as Pats' gambling dad, Pat senior(De Niro).  Based on the best selling novel by Matthew Quick, which transfers well into film, don't expect anything to be truly believable.  Just enjoy it for what it is and make the girls happy.  Production note:  The Philadephia Eagles are an important backdrop in the movie which takes place during the 2nd half of the 2008 NFL season.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|All around fun and a great way to kill some time! Not to violent so even the kids can play it!
031603438X|5.0|A British lawyer was reading this on his vacation in Zanzibar and recommended it as most interesting. Bought it for my son, for his birthday. He agreed - enjoyed it immensely.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the collection. I can see why she wrote it for her kids. She brings the war close to home and the horrors people live but in a way that young teens can understand it. Has no political incline just common sense!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I began reading this series out of boredom.  No longer being in the young adult age group, I found the first book mediocre. The second was better, certainly, but still less compelling than more adult oriented sci-fi and fantasy books.<br /><br />This book started out much the same as the second, but then becomes very compelling for a variety of reasons. The last half of Mockingjay is exceptional. I was impressed with how the author brought Katniss' story to a conclusion, in a manner I was not fully prepared for. No one is going to start with this book, but if you have already started the trilogy, it is worth your time to finish.
