044980691X|4.0|Different ending than I anticipated.  Not  his best work, but better than most novels.  Grisham can't write a bad book!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Excellent!-  worked when other brands didn't  Tied Griffen brand from Walmart. It didn't fit the kindle right.  This charger charges perfect.  Long enough to be used anywhere.
1444710338|5.0|Didn't I already provide a rating?  I will be happy to say again that I love this book.  I have lost 20 pounds since starting on the Dukan Diet and feel confident that I will continue.  It is a plan for life and I want to see more progress that will get me to (and keep me) at my goal weight.  Thank you, Amazon.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Well written book that will keep your interest.  After reading you will think differently about what choices you could make when feeling despirate.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|The graphics are great and the concept of the game is very addictive but the lack of time you have to find the objects is too short. The having to wait for your energy to be restored is also frustrating.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|The story line will keep your interest.  The author has an awesome way of drawing you into the story.  I also learned alot about the progression of Afghanistan's government/politics.  This is a must read.
0553593714|3.0|The plot seemed a little fuzzy, I wouldn't recommend it :( Still, the HBO show is still pretty good .
B003O86FMW|5.0|That is an amazing book! Now I HAVE to read the third book! WARNING: THIS BOOK IS ADDICTING! TRUST ME!
B004SRWW0C|4.0|I really haven't used this app for an extensive time period. As I followed some instructions for my rooted device, I downloaded it to move files into the root area. It was easy to use.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This covered my requirements nicely for a great price:<br />clear so the iPhone shows<br />rim over the face to protect it<br />flexible and shock absorbing
B000QCS8TW|5.0|From the most quaint names<br />To well-crafted characters<br />This is really musical chair of power lust and sacrifice for honor.
B005PK56TA|5.0|This show will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.  The intro music alone is enough to give you nightmares...
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|After upgrading my NC6400 to Windows 7 Pro x64 I had a couple issues with supported hardware / drivers. One in particular was with the embedded Broadcom NetXtreme Gigabit Adapter. Intermittently it would disappear from devices(because the driver used in XP and Vista wasn't supported). Being an IT (networking) consultant, I needed something reliable so I opted for this USB adapter. I saw it had great reviews & it was more than reasonably priced ... $22.00!! so I bought it. As soon as it arrived, like a kid at Christmas, I tried it out. I didn't even need the USB Driver disk. Windows 7 recognized it & installed the drivers automatically and \\"VOILA\\" !! I connected it my Cisco Enterprise switch & tested at 10, 100, & 1000mbps both and Half & full duplex in addtion to Auto-negotiate. No problems. I now use it on a regular basis. (at least until I purchase a new laptop). At this price... you can't go wrong.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Why can't americans produce high quality, entertaining television?  Why does it all come from Britian?  This is a wildly popular series because of the intelligent subject matter that is totally engrossing.  The acting is superb, the scripts are intelligent and there isn't a Kardashian within 1000 miles.
B00CNIDH7A|4.0|I enjoy sitting on the patio and relaxing to Train or enjoying it in my car. They have a great sound and a unique tempo.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a really cute game. the graphics are excellent and the minions are just too fun. could use more winnable gru coins though. the ingame purchase rates are a bit excessive.
1451695195|5.0|A friend told me that this book was a good read. I decided to try it, but did not know why. Well, from the beginning of the book, I have had such a feeling of peace. Normally, I read so quickly through book, but not this one. I have been savoring every single word of it so that I gain the true understanding of Dr. Alexander's words and feelings. I loved this book.
B0076HN3T0|5.0|I think I watched this entire film standing in front of the tv with my shoes on and keys in hand because I couldn't pull myself away from it. Riveting, touching, fascinating.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|my husband likes this game to play with our 6 year old. For me it is somewhat frustrating because you have to start over every time.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I'm really enjoying this series. I wish I had know about it when it was on TV. Walter Bishop is enjoyable with his scientific mind that always craves food at the wrong time. The only part I don't enjoy is the FBI agent Olivia. Her acting is a little stiff to me. I guess that's how her character is supposed to be. It's just annoying. This series make you wonder if some of these events could really happen...
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|thought it was a little slow at first. But now i am hooked. Nice relaxing game to play before bed with my 6 year old.
B002ZBRSMK|5.0|If you were not an enthusiastic and alternative Bowie teen when this movie first came out, it would have gone straight over your head. It went straight into my head. David Bowie was kind of famous already, but something told me he was going to a major star. It's gone far beyond that. He is iconic. How many Grammys and Tonys? He even has an Academy Award over a career that spans four decades. Anyone interested in this artist should see this film because it presents a side of Bowie that was real. The Labyrinth flop. I don't know what happened, but there is David Bowie again, acting, but really terrible. It's all about the script, director, costumers, make-up artists, hair designers... and if the catering truck is no good... then nobody on the entire set is happy.
B009NY43NY|5.0|While I don't care for the TV show, I am a huge fan of the Sookie Stackhouse series as written by Charlaine Harris. After reading the customer reviews I was skeptical, but I still felt compelled to finish the series and I'm so glad I did! If you're a fan of the books thus far, you should definitely give the finale a chance. I thought it ended perfectly, and I don't believe the inconsistencies took anything away from the story itself (if you've read all of the other books, you'll already know that minor inconsistencies occur frequently); on the contrary, it's something I've come to appreciate. As far as the love interest in the end, I couldn't be happier. It seemed to me that the author had a plan in place in regards to that aspect of Sookie's life and followed through with it. Harris' writing has a certain simple charm about it that I love. I will always be a fan of the world of Sookie Stackhouse!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|great story,well acted and beautiful setting.Respecful of time of development,not too long to complete and therefore<br />not exasperating to reach end.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I rated this book so highly because everyone could benefit from Dr. Alexander's story.  Believers of life after death will experience validation of their convictions.  Non-believers, while digging for holes of disproof, well, will be &#34;digging&#34;.  They will be comparing, analyzing, explaining, thinking, and yes, hoping.  What they will be hoping for will be determined by each individual's spiritual journey.  And there you have it:  we all are on a spiritual journey.  Enjoy!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Loved the book.  It was recommended by an avid reader friend.  Hard to beilieve a woman survived prison life with so much supprot from the &#34;outside world&#34;
B008BQL77K|5.0|Love this show so much, I never watched TV before this and now I can't wait for the next episode every time!
B007KZY1YY|1.0|Hated this book, after reading the first I felt I had to read the second, I thought this book would bring you closer to the character's, but no, I still don't like them so I will not be tempted into reading the third book.
0062255657|5.0|This story grabbed my attention in the first paragraph and held it through the final sentence. It's a short book, easy to read in one sitting and hard to put down. The main character of the story is a seven-year-old bookworm who is never named. After a tragic event, he meets the girl who lives at the farm at the end of the street and his life turns upside down. I won't spoil the details. I'll simply say that this concept, in the hands of a bad author, would be laughable, but Neil Gaiman makes every part seem absolutely logical for this world. His writing is subtle and sparse, yet provides enough details for the reader to conjure a complete image of this place and its characters. It reminds me of that time in my life when I was young enough to find magic in everything, a time too many of us forget about as we mature into adulthood.<br /><br />Perfect Sunday afternoon read.<br /><br />-- Emma D, aka Anna Zimmerman
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun, can easily waste time playing if bored. Simple to follow with good graphic. Energy charges fast with no need to purchase to add points.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I am a brony myself and I just love this game is a good time killer.
B005COO1X6|1.0|Could this book have been any worse ???. No character build ups. Plot with the root being something you would expect from an extremely low budget amateur horror film. Short story as you are at the end in 4 events and the ending ??? - We could have used something tangible that maybe even had something to do with the story. Just awful !!!!
0385341075|5.0|One of the best books I,ve read this year. The writing was excellent, the story simple yet breath taking,and the ending although tragic was in all probability what would have happened to our dear dedicated Mr. Pip in the turmoil of which he lived his life.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|Got it on time.....watched it and works just fine......very happy with my order.would order from them again..I do NOT like I have to use SO MANY WORDS for this review.......
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun game, easy to play. I wish the tokens were easier to come by, however I think it's. their ploy to get us to invest $ into the game. It did take a little while to load, but it is a great alternative to Temple Run.
B00C7L8DM2|1.0|I couldn't HAve gathered a better cast and SCREWED IT UP as bad as they did on the film!!!<br /><br />HORRIBLE FILM!!!!
B00BSZZA3I|3.0|A good case for the price. Although a little cumbersome to use at times it serves it's purpose. I would recomend it.
B001R0KH3W|5.0|Super Good Concert
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Well done game, each step trains you for the next step.  very fun, good learning for training to think step by step. I love this game and so do the kids!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this product. It is easy to lose track of time when playing solitaire on my Kindle. It is also very convenient.
B003VANOFY|4.0|These are fine, good sound quality. Clarity is good, didn't experience any sound artifacts. Only drawback is the external connection, kind of large and obstructive for a laptop. Downgraded it a star because of the clunky connection. If this had a small efficient connection, I would rate it 5 stars on the Price/quality continuum.
1607887215|3.0|Ok probably will never listen/ read again I mean this girl was so In love and just leaves him for magic boy......
B000683VI4|5.0|I thought I was getting what I lost [my DVD was not in its case but to my surprise it had 2 disc the scenes that were not in the movie. It made it a lot more interesting. What a nice surprise  If you have not seen it you should
B00BESM14U|3.0|The acting was good , I liked it but I didn't read the book before hand an was shocked about the story.
0385486804|5.0|Bought the book used, expecting an average quality book, however, the book that came was of great quality. The only cosmetic difference between this used book and a newer one was the browning of the pages. Hopefully it will be of good use in my college classes.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|I enjoyed this movie/book the first one was the best, to me anyway. Could read again in the future ....
B00AEFXXMI|5.0|What can I say? I quote this movie extensively, much to the horror of my kids.  Love it, could watch it daily, have worn out several copies already.
B006LSZECO|4.0|INTERESTING WRITING METHOD WITH AN INTRIGUING STORY. THE CHARACTERS AND STORYLINE. KEPT YOU GUESSING. VERY ENJOYABLE READ. I'D DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT.
B008G12ERC|4.0|I only knew a couple of the songs but I like it, I think I need to listen to it some more to get a feel for it. My fav. album will always be absolution.
075669910X|4.0|Worth reading. Well illustrated. A good resource to have if you are interested in this subject. Quality binding, etc. Get it.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I don't spend all my time at home that is why I bought a kindle in the first place if I can't play the game off line please print that in BIG BOLD letters directly under the title so as not to wast the time or space (on our kindles) of your customers who get off the couch get out to enjoy the world
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I love firefly, every episode is unique, but still connected... very few shows ever achieve that. It is a shame that it ended so soon, and the executive at Fox that is responsible should be fired without pension, and/or burned at the stake...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The Downton Abbey series is so very engaging, the acting is superb, and the settings and costumes are beyond compare. I love everything about this series. Here is the warning: once you start, you will be hooked.
B000X1Z0BU|3.0|Quality of the movie was not that great...the story line was cute...but just didn't love it! It was slow moving and I couldn't get past the poor quality of the movie.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I read the Game of Thrones series after being cajoled into it by my niece. I have never enjoyed fantasy prior to this series. I am pleased with the TV series as it follows the books quite closely. That said, it may be hard to follow unless you know the story.
B0013N3DSE|5.0|Great telling of the Robin Hood story and the Blu-ray was fantastic. It unbelievable that a movie from 1938 could be so clear and detailed. I have seen this movie many times over the years, but seeing it in Blu-ray on a 55&#34; TV was like seeing a new movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really fun and a bit of a challenge. I loved it and wished there were more rooms to explore. I can't wait until more comes out.
B007AL48UK|4.0|Summer Mahjong is fun and relaxing to me. I like the summer and beach theme. I would recommend this game to others.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Ideal size, used it on a machete, hatchet, steak knives, Skeletool/Leatherman, and the cutting edge was like new!  I recommend this in any tool box or kitchen!
B004S3MB2U|5.0|I don't normally rate apps. Most work fine, and that is what they are supposed to do. However, this app is the most impressive calculator app i have ever used! It converts distance, weight, metric, etc, with ease, it has forms for calculating payments, interest, and many more. Get it today!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|i bought this book to see what all the hype was about, and basically ended up skipping 3/4 because i couldn't handle another sex scene. sure, some might skip to the sex scenes but this book has so many that it manages to make them boring. i found the writing better than expected given the terrible reviews out there, but simply got bored and started skipping pages.
B000E1JOSE|5.0|This is a great tribute to Roy Orbison and the stars that perform with him are out of sight.<br /><br />Great music!!!
159463176X|5.0|Make sure you have lots of free time when you start this book, because it's hard to put down.  The complex relationships between the characters are marvelously drawn and fascinating.  The book is like a fantastic puzzle that finally fits together in a stunning, but not well-made manner.  I really enjoyed this one, as I have his others.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I always check the weather in the morning and for the upcoming week.  AccuWeather does it best.  Would highly recommend.
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|Every Science Fiction fan should read Frank Herbert's Dune Masterpiece. In my mind it's a must read book and series for all scifi lovers out there.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love it, works great I have the whole house chromed out plus it's Google so you know it's going to have a great additions in the future.
B0073N8XME|5.0|This first book in the Shopaholic series is brilliant!  It's a hilarious read, even if we do cringe at the heroine's antics.  Kinsella has nailed a lot of the crazier elements of the shopaholic in all of us.  She is also adept at both witty dialogue and slapstick comedy.  I've encountered few writers as funny.<br /><br />By the author of \\"It All Started with a Bicycle\\"
B009JBZH54|5.0|The purchase was for a friend's birthday present, i think he loved it! All three movies together is a great bundle.  Perfect.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This came is cool, and not that challenging. Well download it... you will enjoy it. Hurry hurry hurry, before  it too late.

B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Super fun the best games I've got for free on my kindle love it sooo much it's really the belts game
B0012GTZC0|5.0|This story is filled with suspense and this makes it hard to put down, If you must stop reading, it is easy to pick up again,.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't know how to put this book into words... I started reading this late last night and was unable to stop reading until the very last word. This book made me laugh, and it made me cry. It truly is one of the greatest books I have read. To those who have yet to read this book I suggest that you have a box of tissues nearby. And to the author Mr. John Green I cannot thank you enough for having written such a truly moving book, you truly are an artist, and I wish you the best of luck with your future works of art.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|They don't anwser any of my questions.  I can't get past a level even though I got a very large score.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. Needs more levels.  Can not wait until a new version comes out.  A true challenge on each level.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Really liked the action in this movie, and the Avengers series.  Good entertainment, Robert Downey Jr. gets 5 stars from me.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|The first time I watched the series i stopped, because of a scene I thought was contrived, the mercy killing of the dog. Once through that, the elegance of the scene settings, the seemingly authentic depiction of government bureaucracy, the minor character details all combined to create a portrait of what felt like real life characters, making real life compromises. It almost felt like i was in Washington and with Underwood's occasional asides straight to the camera, incorporating the viewer as confidant, the conceit works magnificently. The scene with Underwood preaching in a church, then stopping dead smack in the middle of the oration, with over one hundred and fifty people in the pews, to speak directly to the camera about how he needs to manipulate the social  values of the congregation he understands so well, in order to  get the deal he needs, is heartstopping both in its audacity and comprehension of small town mores.<br /> As the show progresses, Underwood, becomes more and more unlikable, because of the acts he is willing to perform in order to achieve his ultimate goal. But the methods he reveals and the zest with which he undertakes his cause created an unnatural appeal to the character for me. Life, it is said, finds a way. It's only that, in House of Cards, that way is not only often ugly, but bitter, cynical and ultimately,  delusional. But far, far more compelling than any other drama I've watched.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|Each season there seems to be THAT NEW SONG to hit the airways that is sweet, light, meaningful and oh so musical. My ears perk up. My heart beats faster. I listen again. I dance. I listen for the REST of the day...and yes, BUY. No only is Pharrell Williams wonderful in his execution of this song, but many others are also, Covers like George Barnett are exceptional!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire had lots of plot twists!  I really enjoyed reading it, didn't want to put it down!!!  I can't wait to read Mockingjay!!!!
B002N44XSG|3.0|If u have read the Percy Jackson seris than u HAVE to read this it tells story's about them that lead to OH I GET IT moments an  it shows pictures of the characters AND it has like a word search or crossword puzzle at the end
B000JCSPG0|4.0|For the most part I liked the movie. My only two complaints are the music and the dated cgi. The music isn't bad on it's own, but it reminds me so much of Jurassic Park music (or many other movies of that period) that I found it distracting. The cgi is actually not that bad for the most part. It's lucky the movies doesn't really rely on the cgi to make it good--there are only a few places where the (old) cgi really detracted from the overall experience.
1419705644|5.0|This book was great. It's not comprehensive or organized like an encyclopedia should be, but it's still a fun read and interesting if you watch the show.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|After watching the movie twice I still needed clarification on many aspects of this tale, so I read the book and found it both enjoyable, even after seeing the movie, and clarifying on many points. Obviously there is much more detail in the book than the movie and some condensation and combing have taken place in order to make the movie, but all in all the movie is fairly faithful to the book.
B004SBULWE|4.0|The app  works fairly well. I wish it would close the games, but it doesn't. It does help preserve my battery life and that is exactly what I was looking for.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have always liked this game.  Another goodie, once you start it is hard to put it down. I would highly recommend it to anyone whom likes puzzle games.
1594136467|3.0|the person who wrote the book was to proud of his self and is only in this for the money
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|They should have made it available off line as well.  When I start playing I can't put it down, but if I do not have wi fi I am dead in the water.  Try to make it available off line please.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I so enjoyed this very updated version of Sherlock Holmes!  There's a little background and insight into both of the main characters, which doesn't usually happen in other versions.  Plus these actors really take on each of their respective characters so well you believe this has always been Sherlock and Dr. Watson.  Intelligent & Fun!!
B00413QB5A|3.0|This book is not up to the suspense of his later writings like Eye of the Needle and Key to Rebecca, but easy reading
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Excellent character development.  I really felt I came to know and care about the people - what made them do what they did.  Would have given a fifth star except for the ending.  While I was happy that everything &#34;came up roses&#34; for the little slave in the end I found it a bit contrived and unrealistic.
B008B1BL4E|5.0|The best book you will ever read about the events leading up to WWI.  One can see from these past events what the world will look like when the US is no longer the preeminent power; when, like 100 years earlier there was a &#34;balance of power&#34; and each major power was left to prevail over minor powers.
B00908DDZM|5.0|This was a gift for my husband and he listens to it non Stop! We received it faster then what was stated!
B00821OX98|1.0|*MINOR SPOILERS INCLUDED BELOW*<br /><br />While I find the aliens in Falling Skies intriguing--and perhaps even meriting their OWN show--the human characters fall on the complete opposite side of the spectrum. Not only do most of them seem far too healthy and happy to be experiencing a total siege/extinction-level invasion of planet Earth, but even the scenery seems far too untouched, besides a few busted up cars and the odd pieces of shrapnel one might expect to find in abandoned neighborhoods. In any case, how have these people even survived, as visible--and seemingly in the dark about their invaders' capabilities--as they are?! Additionally, the scripting is banal, the actors often seem like they don't even care about being in character, and the casting was clearly questionable.<br /><br />The younger children are the one saving grace of this show. Their characters are interesting, and often conflicted; several offer a glimpse into unusual character motifs, as children that would be growing up in a disaster zone would be expected to have unique--perhaps, morbid--views on many issues.
B00337QJO8|1.0|the Music fade in very very slowly.  thus spoke Zarathustra is almost a third done by the time it fades in loud enough to hear it.  this is a very poor remaster.  origanl was actually better.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great read, couldn't put it down! I felt like I was part of the book. Very good author and have read more of his books since this one
B000007492|2.0|With the exception of dreamer,  all of the songs on this album that are not on the &#34;breakfast in America&#34; album are not worth a second listen.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|First I love Morgan Freeman and every movie Tom Cruise is in is good so I had good expectations going in. This movie did not disappoint. My main criticism was that the plot was a bit obtuse and I needed to see it twice before I really got it. Otherwise, I would add this movie to my collection if Wall Street hadn't destroyed our economy to feed their greed causing jobs to go into Oblivion! lol
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I LOVED this show but unfortunately it got cancelled after the 2nd season so don't get too excited. Wish someone else would pick the show up for the fall or something.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love this alarm clock with its flexible features!!! The sleep timer where I can play my own music is awesome. Multiple alarm settings means I don't keep having to reset the alarm. Buy it!!!
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Definitely older but just as entertaining. Arnold even gives a few nods to the aging process in this movie. What the movie lacks in substance, it makes up for in typical &#34;Arnold&#34; fashion...action. Well cast, and as most Arnold flicks, it doesn't take itself too seriously. As far as I'm concerned, Arnold is still a guarantee for pure escapist, larger that life action cinema. Leave &#34;reality&#34; behind and have fun!
B00B7IJDMA|5.0|I love this soundtrack, although I wish the original theme for &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; was included, rather than just the new mix.  I love that the mood seems normal, despite the horrific situation that the characters find themselves in. Very soulful and beautiful (strange choice of words) that touches the show with meaning and depth, not to just simply set the tone.  I would highly recommend it!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game I think 5 and up! It's so fun!!! Please anyone get it I used to play at night and beat my highscore! Rated E! For for everyone!
B008393Q2O|1.0|Most electronic media has some form of note taking so use that instead of wasting your bytes with this product.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Ignore the bum reviews, someone is obviously on a hate rant, the book was wonderful!! I guess not every book gets a movie deal ;)
B00881VLCE|1.0|Too many problems even before the awful update! Purchased puzzles will not load on my other Kindles, even though they are guaranteed to do so. Since the update, previously purchased puzzle packs will not reload and if you try, the download fails. I have paid over $115.00 for puzzle packs and many of them will not load on any of my Kindle Fires. The developers promised to look into it, but have not even contacted me in over a month. It's a shame that Amazon would still offer this app with all the negative feedback and they are not willing to help either. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
B008KYOCA2|3.0|Does it sync google calendar?  If so , then id say its useful to me. Ive tried many calendar planner apps.but still have not found anything fully functional and useful
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Fictional but with believable characters with developing personalities, human emotions, heroes and villains.  Sex and violence that appears representative of human condition, quest for power, mediaval armed conflict--not placed in the story for no reason.  I read the book after seeing television series season 1 (I normally prefer to read first and view later).  Both forms excellent entertainment, the television portrayal faithful portrayal of the book with added benefit of (mostly) apt capting, 'period' costumes, sweeping sets/scenery, and lush cinematography.  The book great entertainment on its own without the series.
B005H9B44A|3.0|This is a good movie to pass the time, the action and plot were pretty ok/good, but the way they portrayed the romance was cheesy and unrealistic. I don't know how it was done in the comic books (were there comic books on Thor?) but I found myself rolling my eyes constantly.
0749707232|5.0|This book is probably best enjoyed by those with a solid mastery of French literature -- I would say perhaps two years of advanced college French.  St.-Exupery isn't easy to read and those without a good grounding in French might enjoy him more with an English-French edition.<br /><br />The English edition also makes a great children's book selection for gifts for the holidays.

B00ABGEFWC|5.0|If you and your child have patience, you don't have to pay for anything to enjoy this game.  It adjusts to age of user.
B004I744AS|5.0|I just used this app for the first time and I think it is terrific. I recently read a book that occasionally used an unfamiliar word and I didn't want to Get out of my comfortable chair to go to another room to get my dictionary.<br />Now I can use my Kindle as a dictionary and it is always next to my chair. Thank you for this free app.
B00005N6KG|3.0|I had to return mine as they were defective. But WOW you would have no idea they were on your head. Can't comment on sound, but anything Sony puts out is top notch.

B0010SEMP0|5.0|I really liked the books so much that I have been buying a lot of her books.  The dynamics with Cat is great.
B00D2K40WY|2.0|This game is quite fun. And is great for girls. But the problem with this game is that only like three things in each category are unlocked for everyone. No one wants to have to pay seventeen bucks for a virtual hair do. So if you want to make this game truly enjoyable for everyone. Then PLEASE MAKE EVERYTHING AVAILABLE.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|People say the truth will set you free. What they don't tell you is that sometimes the truth leaves you feeling more `hopeless' than you could ever imagine.<br /><br />What an emotional journey I took while reading Hopeless. Fans of Colleen Hoover will not be disappointed with this novel. There are ups, downs, revelations, and a wonderful love story all bundled up in this book. You definitely will not be able to put this one down. I was so engrossed in the story - I had to stay up half the night to finish. I just couldn't stop reading!!<br /><br />To say Sky Davis has led a sheltered life is an understatement. How would you feel without modern conveniences? Would you attend a school where you were labeled an `outsider'? Sky handles things in stride with a blatant, honest attitude towards life.<br /><br />When Dean Holder meets Sky - he mistakes her for 'someone else'. They cross paths at the grocery store, while running, and again at school. The attraction between the two is instantaneous. Holder's sexy attributes, clever vernacular, and witty attitude leave Sky feeling some very intense emotions about Holder.<br />He intrigues her, but she is also scared of the attraction she has for him.<br /><br />Both will embark on a journey of revelations. As I said, learning the truth doesn't always set you free. Yet through the hopelessness - there can live Hope.<br /><br />Be prepared to feel the heartache as well as the romance in this touching novel. There will be earth shattering revelations with such gripping descriptions. Colleen Hoover is a truly talented writer.....one that pulls you into her world of writing....one page at a time.

B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Fast paced, lawyer movie.  Season 1 was the best, but Season 2 is too similar.  Most episodes have same flow, style, etc. as Season 1 (I.e., not as exciting), so not a 5 star like first Season.
B008Y5UADK|2.0|Neither the black and white, nor the shaky camera work added substantially to the central themes of psychosis, paranoia, and genius.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a cute game.  It is entertaining and fun.  Would probably be more fun if a person would win once in a while.  A great way to use time when you can't sleep.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Can't say too much, but the storyteller is excellent!  Well paced with lots of twists.  I may have found my next favorite author!

B00ARA4SLU|4.0|Psycho is one of my favorite movies. I would recomend this movie to anyone who likes Hitchcock movies or that like Anthony Hopkins.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|This fully satisfied my completionist tendencies, coming as a book-style case with all the different versions of the film and some production stills.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|There's much room for improvement here, it's a little soon for this product to come on the market.<br /><br />Currently, I own a { TIVO, ROKU, APPLETV, Samsung-SmartTV } -- was interested to see what this little device would bring to the world.<br /><br />1) It's not easy to setup.<br />  - It didn't like my brand new tv, it would not install on there.  Had to use a monitor with an HDMI-IN port to install.<br />  - Couldn't install from my ios device.<br />  - Minor complain -- you must have a wireless device to install.<br /><br />2) It doesn't do much for you if you if you don't live in the android world.  If you live in the Apple world, stick with the AppleTV.<br /><br />Who want's mine?  I haven't found a reason to use it.
B0025KW29U|5.0|Commenting on the product received (rather than the show): this came in a case that was two-thirds the thickness of a standard case and was the first I have had in this size (might be more common elsewhere... another bluray in the same order (Fifth Element) also came in a two-thirds case).
B004VFN7BE|5.0|Good thriller, great characters, well-acted. Weaver and Robert Downey Jr make for interesting studies. Good plot, good pace. You'll enjoy.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|Commenting on the product received (rather than the film): The slightly thinner than normal bluray case was new to me, but fine I guess.
B0096HK4WW|3.0|Not a great movie, and not scary, but pretty humorous throughout. Watch it if you want something funny to watch.

Especially for kids who love peacocks.  There's not many choices out there.  Schleich are the best plastic animals by far!!!
B008Y6RYDS|5.0|This may not appeal as much to people of the current era - it's sometimes slow and wanders a bit in the way that a picture about stoned people, made by stoned people, naturally would.  Still, the appeal is the authenticity of certain aspects of the era - the attempt at communal living, the derision of straight people toward the hip culture and the reality of the &#34;hip-entrepreneur,&#34; meaning those of us who thought doing illegal stuff was okay so long as it in some way was counter to &#34;the man&#34; and all those remnants of 50s conservatism.  For cinephiles, there's the rather radical use of sudden flash-forwards throughout the film--a technique that worked truly well and certainly showed a lot of us who were used to Hollywood linear film-think that you could play with time and space, exactly as our experiments with consciousness told us we could.  And beyond all that is the amazing music--great, original THRILLING music from the absolute golden era of rock and roll.  So, yeah, if you can dig it, then dig it.  If you can't, then just walk on by.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I had heard so much about Downton Abbey that I just had to check it out. I was hooked from the opening scene and now it is at the top 0f my list .
B00BEIYH6U|3.0|\\"The sequel to the controversial dark action comedy, Kick-A**, brings a new slice of the pie that is surprisingly humorous, occasionally humanised, stylistic, and still very violent and sadistic (more about the brutality later).<br /><br />Without giving too much away but the scene involving Chloe Moretz playing Mindy, not Hit Girl watching a Union J music video and the scenes involving the cackle-mouthed girls lambasting about Mindy was so hilarious and interesting that it stood out over what are perceivably under-received yet dynamic performance from Jim Carrey (who thankfully decided not to promote the film) and a drive toward rushed action over more enriched storytelling. The same issues with this action vs. storytelling aspect stood out with recent big-budget films like The Dark Knight Rises, The Avengers, and Thor.<br /><br />It did not have the novelty of the first film nor the shock factor to the highest level of its predecessor but it still sufficed with some humanity in the film with Hit Girl's alternative, high school life and Kick-Ass' troubles with his father. The Hit Girl character is strongly represented here that the film could've almost been called, \\"Hit Girl: A Spin-off of Kick-A**\\" (an issue apparent with Cars 2 where it focused too much on Tow Mater than the others).<br /><br />Aside from that, Kick-A** 2 suffers a bit from standing out and timing but it is all an acceptable effort on a more commercialised sequel and makes for fun yet painful viewing with beer and crisps after a football game.\\"<br /><br />*PARENTAL WARNING: In regards to the violence, it is just as graphic, sadistic, extreme, and potentially disturbing as the first film but to a slightly less degree given the novelty of the first (no one expected a 11-12 year old girl could kill or curse like that) and excess promotion of Hit Girl as now a cult pop culture icon, in a way. Along with the irony, dark humour, and normalcy of the frequent brutality as well as strong foul language (including the f and c-words), this film is in no way suitable for children especially given the ages or youthfulness of the main characters and stylistic, sensationalistic violence involved. The 15 certificate in Britain was not well deserved, in my opinion, and like its predecessor should've been an 18 due to the violence and themes as one. The filmmakers, from how I perceive it, wanted to make it 15-ish enough by skimming on bloodshed a bit and detail to make it more available to teenagers (who are the target audience for comic books, in which the true Kick-Ass source material is slightly more graphic and disturbing than the films). In addition, the film could be, if without artistic leaning, exploitative or subject to child protection laws with the violence, use of weapons, and perverse content (especially involving a kiss in the end). In all of this, it is a fun film at parts but please exercise with caution!\\"cluding the f and c-words), this film is in no way suitable for children especially given the ages or youthfulness of the main characters and stylistic, sensationalistic violence involved.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is one of those games where it's free but u don't have to pay for anything later. I mean, sure, there is an option to buy some things, but u can still play the game without having it. Also, if you love village games, you'll live this.
B00DGABUIC|5.0|Long story short.  Friend works at DW.  Is working on Dragons2.  Showed me this link.  Now we both own one.  Couldn't be happier.<br /><br />Showed it to another friend and she nearly vomited from the cuteness overload.  True story.
B00CL68BK2|2.0|To much yelling and screaming by obviously mentally unstable members of a broken family.  Movie was a waist of Robert DiNero's talent and time.
B00BWGISB4|5.0|NKOTB have always been amazing and will continue to be amazing. They haven't missed a beat. Still has great sound!
B0000B1OFL|3.0|If you have a teenage boy, this movie has &#34;relatively&#34; little bad language/sex, yet keeps their interest. As the mother, I even found it interesting enough to watch once.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|My daughter's and I love this movie and never get sick of it. There is a cute storyline. There are parts that go over the children's head that are meant for adults to keep them entertained as well. I just overall love this movie.
B0002E4A5K|5.0|All the wonderful details are covered by other reviewers. I'll just emphasize that this Nero is not to be missed.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch Rapp as his usual best by Vince Flynn. You can never get enough of him about government corruption and espionage. Eventually I will have read every book by Flynn.
0786962984|4.0|I know the box says ages 8 and up, but I was able to play this with my 5 and 7 year old and had a blast. My only complaint (and it's a minor one) is that the cards are SO small, it makes it tough to keep them together and organized. The game itself is great, though.
B005DJRIXU|1.0|This comedy is only about having promiscuous sex without hardly a thought.  I thought it would be like RJ Burger, but it doesn't come close.  THAT show was actually funny.  In one of the first episodes of akward the main character loses her virginity to a boy she hardly knows in a janitors closet at school.  It is the attitude and disregard with which sex is handled that offends me, note that American Pie is one of my all time favorite movies.  Somehow this one comes off slutty and inappropriate instead of funny and 'real'.  My opinion.
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|I like the action and love Bruce Willis, I would prefer more details about how his son became an CIA
B00AYB16EO|5.0|Great movie. It was very funny and also a movie which you can keep watching and can still be funny..
B009P5S11G|3.0|Rihanna is a great singer but I did not like this cd. It is a great dvd. Just too much repeat of songs.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|This wasn't bad at all. The story was interesting seeing an older Bruce Wayne.  Being a fan of Batman, I've never really thought about him in an older state.  So this was all new and really never thought of by me so I was intrigued by the story and how they would be able to tell it and keep it real with how real Batman's character has always been (No superpowers, no flying, super strength) While some kids may want to watch this, I'd say probably teenager's would be fine, I believe there was some language and violence that I wouldn't want say my 8-10 year old nephew's watching but I'd feel safe showing them when they are older at a teen age if they are still into the comic book characters.<br /><br />Like I said, it a dark story, like a lot of the graphic novels that are so popular these days with the comic's, and I look forward to watching part 2 which they sort of lead into at the end....I do have it, haven't watched it yet.  As far as the animated DC movies, this one holds up well with the other's I've seen, because it is different being the view of Batman/Bruce Wayne older so I think if you enjoy the other DC animated movies or the graphic novels and haven't seen this yet or may be hesitant, give it a shot, I think you'll like it and want to get the 2nd one to see what's next for this story.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Really like this game.  If you like match three games this one is for you.  Adds a twist the the normal match 3!
B00APJLY0Q|2.0|I guess this movie would depend on how old your kids are and how easily they are to being scared of some of the typical Halloween characters (Dracula, Frankenstein, Mummy ect..) My daughter said she watched this at her summer daycare during a rainy day, the older kids watched a movie during the younger kids nap time.  She is 6....she liked it (so she said) I've tried to watch it with her twice and she was 20 minutes into it and was off coloring and painting, I turned it off because I just thought it was stupid.<br /><br />I really can't give a great review on it because I didn't watch it all but I can seem where some elements would scare some kids, like I said depending on how old they are and how easily they are scared to those Halloween type characters.  Adam Sandler's voice is very easy to recognize, he's used it before in other movies, it just seemed to me like a thrown together movie to make a few quick bucks.  So 2 stars out of 5, rent it, don't buy it first, give it a shot, maybe it will be something you will like.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I have played this game for quite a while, downloaded it twice, and highly recommend it. I am definitely  a fan of the developers work, and would even recommend the ones I haven't played yet, just from how awesome this game is. A lot of work has gone into this one alone, and they have a lot of them.
B005OKXU44|5.0|So funny.  wish i could remember all the one liners!!!<br />Hopefully highschool isnt like this.  My poor daughter if so....
B004UJAOLM|1.0|This book is very depressing. All characters are so flawed, egotistical, selfish, cruel, vain, weak... The book evokes nothing but extremely negative feelings. Women dying giving birth, children brought up without any love or care, deaths, obsession, alcoholism, you name it. Seems like nobody coud live past the age of 40 those days.  This book actually gave me nightmares. I do not see the value in reading a book that paints such a dark picture of the world. For that I can watch CNN News.
B001F7MSG6|4.0|From the moment it began, with Prince Nuada's work out, I was stunned. Written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, it introduced Nuada as a charismatic bad guy. And yet many of his lines were the most serious and true in the whole film. Luke Goss as Prince Nuada stole the film for me. Ron Perlman was excellent as always, but Hellboy is, after all, a traitor to his species, choosing humans over the world of elves and demons, a world that humans will try to crush completely, just as they are destroying the earth itself.<br /><br />In the end i must favor those who gallantly try to save the life of their kind, and there to save the planet from humans.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Although it was a rather slow moving motion picture, Matthew McConaughey's acting was fabulous.  There wasn't an overkill of violence and the story line was good.
B00E1LAS42|1.0|The day it came out I bought it at full price VOD.  Halfway through the movie the only real reason I continued to watch it was to get my $20 worth.  The story is tired itself, rich people being phenomenally rich and the other class being their servants.  I think by now we've ALL had a little to much of this in Real Life.  Watching it played out on TV is muck like watching paint dry.  I'll be first in line for LD's next movie but this one he should have passed on.
B00976QBBU|4.0|Michael Jackson had the inevitable and unenviable task come 1987 of releasing a follow-up to not just one of the biggest selling albums of all time, but one of the most beloved, \\"Thriller.\\" \\"Bad\\" is the result, and it couldn't help but pale in comparison. That's not to say the album lacks for terrific material, in fact, punch for punch, it is very nearly \\"Thriller's\\" equal, and it certainly is better than \\"Off The Wall.\\" It once again racked up multiple chart hits, with five singles hitting number one from '87 to '89. Thanks to Quincy Jones, the production is immaculate, and between Jones and Jackson, the songs not written by Jackson were cherry picked to magnify Jackson's strengths.<br /><br />\\"Bad\\" also was formulaic in its pursuit of Thrillermania. The big dance number is the title track. The bad girl of \\"Billie Jean\\" is replaced by \\"Dirty Diana.\\" That's also where the star rock guitar solo comes from, with Billy Idol's Steve Stevens takes the place of Eddie VanHalen. The superstar deut came from Stevie Wonder instead of Paul McCartney, on \\"Just Good Friends.\\" And the happy-time dance song was \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" in the same vein as \\"Pretty Young Thing.\\" While Jackson hinted at his personal paranoia on \\"Billie Jean,\\" this time it comes out fully formed as \\"Leave Me Alone\\" (which was not on the original album but basically is considered part of it after it was released as a video).<br /><br />But everyone from the 80's already knows that. The man reason to bother picking up the 25th Anniversary of \\"Bad\\" is the second disc of bonus tracks. Three of them were on an earlier reissue, \\"Streetwalker,\\" \\"Fly Away\\" and a Spanish version of \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You.\\" Now we get the later in French, plus six previously unreleased demos. I'm no fan of modernized remixes, so I'll refrain from commenting on the likes of Pitbull hanging out on \\"Bad.\\" Of the new tracks, the Latin feel of \\"Don't Be Messing Around\\" is the most intriguing, and shows what a perfectionist Jackson was. It sounds like a finished song, yet  Micheal gave it a pass and never went back to it for future CD's. \\"Song Groove (Abortion Papers)\\" would have been controversial on many levels, yet it has a wicked groove. \\"Price of Fame\\" is another complaint about fame and even references \\"Billie Jean,\\" and \\"Al Capone\\" milks the \\"Wanna Be Something\\" groove needlessly. Both are no big deal.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you bought the 2001 reissue, there's not much of a reason to go after \\"Bad25.\\"Jackson was.

0064471837|5.0|This book was originally \\"required reading\\" by a good friend of mine (as in \\"if you don't read this, we can't be friends\\").  Well I always hated being forced to read anything, so with much grumbling and complaining, I opened Sabriel with no idea of the excellently woven story and original take on magic and necromancy that awaited me.  Two days later, I informed him with glee that I had finished the book, and naturally I asked what came next.  I was hooked by an imaginative take on fantasy, by Sabriel, who is a much better role model for teenage girls than Bella will ever be, and by the sound of bells.  The world seems natural, though it is a place where technology exists alongside magic, and guns are used right along with swords and bows.<br /><br />  The cast of characters is also feels amazingly natural (even the characters who clearly aren't).  Sabriel is an organically written young woman with her own fears, goals and desires.  What starts off as her quest to simply save her father, becomes a battle to save the Kingdom which he serves and the world at large.  Her supporting cast, Touchstone and Mogget are both unique in their own way.  One torn out of his own time, and the other a magical creature bound to serve Sabriel's family against his own will.  In conclusion, this novel was forced on me and I am glad it was.  I have reread it many times and devoured the sequels voraciously.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
0374203032|3.0|Michael Sandel's book What Money Can't Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of markets and either a misunderstanding of market arguments, or an unfamiliarity with the breadth of such arguments. It further shows an over reliance on his own idea of virtue ethics and an Aristotelian paternalism which is incredibly objectionable.<br /><br />I purchased the book for a graduate school course and, as a read, it's very easy - though I did use audio book as well - so long as you can stomach the arguments. The things that he addresses, he addresses well, but his implicit assumption that the state must exist and equally implicit assertion that it must make people moral is laughable considering that neither of the two points is addressed. If the book was purely concerning moral theory, it would be a wonderful treatise on living \\"the good life\\". How it is written, however, is \\"You're going to live what I term to be 'the good life' whether you like it or not.\\"<br /><br />He further ignores the idea of treating people and their contributions to society well, opting instead to vilify those who make large sums of money and champion the poor as titans of virtue and proper valuation, claiming in many places that money cheapens the value of things. Though he dusts over the idea that it is people's minds and attitudes which must change in order to get to the moral society he desires while discussing paying students for achievement, the idea never returns and he advocates using the state to force compliance with his moral code - while decrying the same practice by parents, claiming that it stunts moral education.<br /><br />All in all, after Justice and this book, I am largely unimpressed with Sandel as a political philosopher due to the fact that the only explicitly political questions that he deals in, he treats as assumptions, and then attempts to work out how such assumptions are aligned.
B0045HCJGC|5.0|The suspense and action and has the right characters for each part.  Wesley did an exceptional job in his role
B00633W614|5.0|Before I read the next in the series I am trying to work out in my mind what twists may be coming
B00004BZ16|3.0|If you LOVE the Clash then you will LIKE this album.  This massive, unpolished menagerie of songs is not a cohesive classic like London Calling is, but its entertaining and interesting with a few hidden gems sprinkled throughout.  A bit on the boring and bland side too often though.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very entertaining for myself and my teenagers. I love that there is no way to cheat and you must be intelligent to keep up!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|TV usually is not this good.  The fourth season keeps the action and intrigue going.  Well played Breaking Bad, well played.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this but I love this series.  The acting and characters are excellent.  It is very fast paced- my husband and I have to put the captions on just to keep up with the lines, but don't let that stop you from watching you this show.  The series is excellent.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Great story, great inspiration. If you like running it gives you a reason to think; if you don't, it might give you a reason to start.
0545123283|5.0|This series was amazing and for the price i got it at, you can't beat it. Would definitely recommend this book to any teenager that is into romance novels that go out of the box.
B004LROUW2|5.0|This novel--like his opus, Wind Up Bird Chronicle--is so well written and engaging that you won't even notice how long it is once you get into it.
B00640UICA|5.0|A relaxing and fun puzzle game that doesn't frustrate. That doesn't mean it's too easy, however. As you level up the puzzles get more complex. A very enjoyable experience over all.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|GREAT GAME would highly recommend to anyone that likes games.  Some of the rooms were a little harder than others.

B002HJ9PTO|3.0|Nothing too remarkable but you get what you pay for. The wind sock (foam thing) is pretty cheap - it would be nice if it was just stuck on there and not detachable.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Some great old footage of many of the artists and hit albums that made Sound City what it was the '70s, '80s, and '90s. Grohl deserves a lot of credit for preserving all this music-industry history as well as the board itself.
B00881VLCE|5.0|love all the different puzzles. also loved that you can do puzzles over 100 pieces. thought the puzzles look like fun
B006QKJQM6|2.0|This review is primarily based on Amazon video quality. The quality is so bad for both voice and picture that in some places within the movie you will wonder if there is action or noise if you do not have the Captioning turned on. With captioning on you'll see that you are apparently missing some action. This happened in some of the kung fu scenes, the major battle scene and during at least one of the flashbacks.<br /><br />The Amazon rental was tested on two different screens with 3 sound configurations.<br /><br />The movie itself is adorable. The amazon quality of playback is horrid and ruins any potential enjoyment for the film.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Characters that develop and plots that drive things along.  Done well, as it is here, that is what great story-telling is all about.  Add snappy visuals and appealing music and you have some fine TV.
B00005LQ04|5.0|Suspiria is one of the greatest horror films of all-time. It's hard to believe it does not warrant a Blu-Ray release in the US. Dario Argento is a living legend in the same vein as Mario Bava (who pioneered the early giallo). This 2001 3-disc Limited Edition does a good job of honoring the classic film and is the best option for Americans. You are getting over an hour of bonus material. This is a Limited Edition 3 Disc Set (60,000 Only) that contains an exclusive 52 minute documentary with all new cast & crew interviews, and the original CD soundtrack by Goblin. Suspiria is uncut, uncensored and remastered from the original negative.<br /><br />Special Features:<br />TV and Radio Spots, Poster and Stills Gallery<br />Suspiria Music Video by Daemonia<br />Original Goblin Soundtrack CD<br />\\"SUSPIRIA: 25th Anniversary\\" (52 Min) - Interviews with Co-Writer/Director Dario Argento, Co-Writer Daria Nicolodi, Cinematographer Luciano Tovoli, Composers Goblin (Claudio Simonetti, Massimo Morante, Fabio Pignatelli & Agostino Marangolo), and Stars Jessica Harper, Stefania Casini & Udo Kier<br /><br />Buy this film! I rate the film 5 stars and this product 5 stars until we get a deluxe 2-disc Blu-Ray release with 4 hours of retrospective documentaries, audio commentaries, and deleted scenes. Europeans have enjoyed Suspiria on Blu-Ray since 2010 yet there has never been a US release!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so fun it can be very mind challenging  but very fun!!!! Love 18teen year old sindy! !!!???
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|If you love horror, with a twist, than American Horror Story is for you, fantastic storytelling with a lot of twists and turns and surprises.  There is some  scenes that would be disturbing to someone young, so I would recommend it for young adults and up, as there is lots of blood, violence, partial nudity and of course, some ghosts, as well as a story of a family struggling to pull itself together after a father's bout of unfaithfulness.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Setup required a little router tweak--my router only broadcasts the UPnP every half hour or so, so it took some time for Chromecast and the router to find each other enough to allow setup, but after that it was utterly brainless to set up.<br /><br />Netflix is flawless. Youtube is perfect. I have all three wireless devices (desktop computer, television, router) within 15 feet of each other with super strong connections, and Cast-this-tab worked GREAT on Hulu plus as long as I wasn't downloading or streaming anything massive. Occasionally sound and video would get a tiny bit out of sync, I'd pause the playback on Hulu, wait for it to catch up and then play again and it would correct--unlike many applications where once the sound is out of sync, you are out of luck.<br /><br />This has given our TV new life. I can now watch a video and do full-screen applications at the same time, which my kids are very happy about. Right now I'm leaving a review while my son watches our muppet playlist on Youtube, snuggling next to me.<br /><br />Adding this to my list of things that do not suck.<br /><br />Oh, we lost connection once (probably the router's fault) and turning the TV off and back on fixed it completely.<br /><br />We don't have cable and pretty much only used the TV for video games until my eldest moved out, so it's been unused for nearly a year. It really is bringing new life to our tv.<br /><br />Warning: The $35 pricetag is great...but it may end up with you buying new furniture, hiring electricians to put plug sockets in new places, and that isn't cheap....<br /><br />Addendum: I've knocked a star off. With use, bugs have cropped up. Netflix does not always load consistently, Youtube has issues with more than 30 items in a playlist. Extensive troubleshooting has not yet resolved these issues, but we've found some workarounds (reboots, opening up the app and finding the chromecast seems to \\"kick\\" it into gear). They're going to be replacing it soon, and we'll seeif that helps.
B00821OX98|5.0|I love this show, it starts out a little slow and just a tad boring at first, but gets very good- I'm almost through the last season and I can't stop watching now!!!
1400052181|5.0|I believe this book IS on the reading list at the fine school one of my grandkids goes to.  Hooray!  The story is utterly fascinating, well told and well documented.  It was especially linteresting to me because it turns out my family and I have weirdly close ties to the Hopkins personnel involved.  Dr. Telinde performed my mother's hysterectomy.  Dr. Brack , who invented the Brack Pack, a means of transporting the cells, was my mother's AND my gynecologist for many years, as well as a close personnel friend.  Dr. Howard Jones was the husband of Dr. Georgianna Jones, head of the Hopkins Infertility Clinic which I went to for years.  Luckily she misdiagnosed me as being unable to have children (I later did); on her advice I adopted in infancy my wonderful daughter.  So for better or worse I felt a connection with the ear and the personnel who were responsible for the cilrcumstances surrounding Mrs. Lacks' cell gathering.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|I don't usually read this type of book but it was incredibly empowering and engaging. This is a must read for women and men.
B00007GZR5|1.0|Virtually unwatchable, &#34;What Dreams May Come&#34; (1998) is pure, unmitigated schmaltz that rings hollow. Oscar-winning visuals only emphasize the misguided banality — a pale shadow of Richard Matheson's metaphysical novel. For all his comedic gifts, Robin Williams utterly fails at solemnity. And Max von Sydow's presence is a terrible thing to waste.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Saw the series before I ordered it. Terrific I highly recommend this. A comprehensive look at the war in the Pacific through a varied set of eyes. Hanks and Spielberg at least equalled or exceeded Band of Brothers.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|OMG! its totes intresting whoever thinks it earned a 4 or less are totes cray-cray!okay i can stop talking like an amature now…
0618918248|1.0|Alas, my dear and beloved Richard put all of his intellectual eggs into that basket (the table of contents); or, if you like, it would appear that he put more thought into the book's structure than into the arguments (and evidence) therein.<br /><br />I'd hoped for a book that laid out arguments which could seriously challenge a person--or that would, at least, teach me at least one thing I'd never read before (in this field), and perhaps I was expecting too much from TGD, or from Richard himself (who is a very attractive, feisty, and well-spoken individual).<br /><br />What I found, however, was a rehashing of the same arguments and examples that I've been reading for nearly forty years; unfortunately, the rehashed material was more effectively presented in the (more) original sources.<br /><br />Further, The God Delusion has some fatal flaws that make it an ineffective, albeit enjoyable, read for anyone seeking knowledge, logic, and/or empirical facts. [Note: Dawkins claims that \\"there is no such thing as a fact, only social context.\\"]<br /><br />The book was meant for novices in the field of apologetics, history, science, even; in other words, it will not add to the knowledge or thought of anyone who 1) has previously researched any of the claims made by the author, and/or 2) has attended graduate school.<br /><br />This is because 1) as previously mentioned, the arguments offered up are somewhat primitive (and not in an Occam's Razor way), and 2) any decent graduate program teaches students how to write an impressive book outline their first month in.<br /><br />In sum, if you've never read anything about/in defense of atheism, this one is as good a place to start as any--not saying it's good, but just as good as others like TGD.<br /><br />If you're looking for something brimming with logic, scientific evidence, historical accounts, etc., keep shopping; I wasn't impressed or challenged by it (though I do like RD's writing style), and most of the serious/seasoned atheists, anti-theists, philosophers I'm acquainted with agree that \\"Dawkins doesn't represent us,\\" and \\"there are better atheist arguments out there.\\"<br /><br />Indeed, there are.<br /><br />_ _ _ _ _<br /><br />Closing note: If you read books of this ilk--whether for or against--keep in mind that the authors are merely vessels for thoughts, and that you can dislike the author but agree with the claims written by the author (and vice versa, of course).<br /><br />Likewise, humans belonging to one system of beliefs or another may be imperfect examples of that faith (or lack thereof), and poor ambassadors of that belief (or not).<br /><br />The point is, it's more beneficial to \\"do the work\\" (research, think it through, then decide) than it is to slide into a security blanket of ignorant parroting of what \\"everyone else\\" is saying--just because it's easier than taking the time to make an informed decision.<br /><br />In other words, better to say \\"I'm not sure yet\\" or \\"I'm working on that\\" than to say \\"I'm a Wiccan!\\" today, then \\"Santeria is my life!\\" tomorrow, then \\"Shinto rocks!\\" the day after, then \\"I'm an atheist!\\" followed by \\"I worship the Goddess!\\"<br /><br />So, how does this process begin? Ask a hundred people and you might just get 200 answers.<br /><br />Here's the list I followed:<br /><br />1) Make a list of the things you believe about the \\"big questions.\\" The way you answer these questions determines your worldview. (NOTE: Google \\"worldview quiz\\" or \\"the big questions in life\\" or similar things in order to get a point in the right direction.)<br /><br />2) Examine the religious or philosophical texts in question (Bible, Kor'an, etc.) and make a note of what seems off to you; do you dislike that particular faith because it disses something you like, or because it makes no sense, or because it may have been implicated in bad stuff recently or back in the day or...?<br /><br />3) Read/watch/listen to material from opposing views. (NOTE: Don't seek outbooks that back up what you've suspected or decided, this is the easy way out; instead, do the work yourself.)<br /><br />In this time of technological advance, instant everything, and constant connectivity, it's easier than ever to find out about the things you love, the things you hate, and the things you love to hate; unfortunately, it's also easier than ever to find a poster child that resonates with you, settle for them as your go-to guru, and then parrot everything they say (without thinking it through).<br /><br />Does that mean that the guru's arguments are automatically invalid? Of course not.<br /><br />What it does mean, however, is that you should make those arguments your arguments before believing them (and before parroting them and buying matching bumper stickers). This applies to everything, of course--from food to music, from hobbies to preferred shopping locations.<br /><br />In other words, MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS, STAND BY THEM (OR FIND A BETTER WAY), TAKE OWNERSHIP, and in all things, BE YOURSELF! (The things you can't stand about yourself might be loved by those around you!)<br /><br />OK, <end \\"Think!\\" Lecture and \\"You ROCK!\\" Pep Talk><br /><br />Best wishes to all who read this (and HAPPY SHOPPING on this excellent website that I'm addicted to!),<br />Miss Sally (a Victorian schoolmarm's worst nightmare :)ant to check out Lee Strobel's The Case for Christ or Ibn Warraq's Why I am a Muslim, which both discuss their respective faith's take on the Almighty.<br />For some interesting, erm, interestingness, hit Bertrand Russel or Nietzsche.<br /><br />For some great philosophy and logic, check out nearly anything by CS Lewis. For a guy who had quite the way with words, check out G. K. Chesterton.<br /><br />For a kindergarten-level look at atheism, click on that yellow button above and pick up The God Delusion, and maybe look up RD's videos on Expert Village.
B001DWNUCO|4.0|Caligula was an extremely controversial film about Caesar Caligula in ancient Rome. Malcolm MacDowell stars as Caesar. We see all the killing, sex, political intrigue, and general nastiness of the Roman empire at its height and decline. This 2008 2-disc (1 BD & 1 DVD) Imperial Edition Blu-Ray is a deluxe release of a very powerful film. Caligula was released in both X (156 min) and R-Rated (153) versions. The X cut is very raw with plenty of sexual content. The R cut is shorter without the hardcore scenes but some alternate footage has been added. The special features are ported over from the 3-disc DVD release of Caligula. This set is a fan's dream but those who dislike the film won't change their mind about it. You are getting 2 cuts, 3 commentaries and about 90 minutes in bonus supplements.<br /><br />Special Features:<br />- Three feature-length audio commentaries with stars Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren and on-set writer Ernest Volkman<br />- Video interviews with director Tinto Brass and actors John Steiner and Lori Wagner<br />- 12 Deleted and alternate scenes<br />- Behind the scenes footage<br />- Set photo gallery, Theatrical trailers<br />- Gore Vidal's original screenplay (DVD-ROM), Three Penthouse Magazine Features (DVD-ROM), Interview with Bob Guccione (DVD-ROM)<br />- Press Kit (DVD-ROM), Cast and Crew Biographies (DVD-ROM)<br /><br />Buy this film if you can handle the hardcore violence and sex. My only complaint is that the video is drab and the audio is just OK (although this is the best the film has ever looked it is not high-quality HD due to how it was originally filmed).
0307719774|5.0|Love this book. It's been a fun way to write thoughts and things about myself on a daily basis. It will be great to look back and see the things I wrote after the 5 years is up.<br /><br />Would be a great gift for a teenager or late teen transitioning to college. The time of life when your thoughts and ideas are really developing and changing.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|If I could rate this lower I would.  I now do not have a working kindle.  The day I loaded this I tried it out and it froze.  I let it sit for an hour then I tried to turn the kindle off. I did, but now it will not turn on again.  That was about 3 weeks ago and my kindle is still lifeless...
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I purchased this to use with my gaming laptop and my Sennheiser HD 380 Pro headphones and so far, the combo is superb. I was a bit worried if this amp would be a good match for my 380 Pro's and I must say, it powers them up to higher volumes without breaking a sweat. I could not hear any distortion. I like the menu options and the look of the device. It's a bit hefty in weight for such a small package. I've been an audio nut for many years and I do love this device and feel that it is well worth its asking price.
B00BOXZAG6|2.0|A French Canadian sci-fi romance that feels more foreign than it actually is. The scoop here is twin worlds, floating side-by-side through the cosmos with inverse gravitational pulls. What's up for one is down for the other and all that jazz; certain mountaintops or skyscrapers venture close enough to actually touch the opposite landscape. A lot of time and effort is sunk into explaining this concept, which seems like wasted effort because not only is it mostly self-evident, but the finer laws (like the idea that matter from one world bursts into flames after an hour on the other) are often broken without consequence as the plot gradually develops. The film's best qualities are undoubtedly visual. A concept like this one will often live or die by how it's visualized on the screen and, despite never completely shaking a major case of disorientation, it's a dazzling, vivid, mesmerizing display that downright demands our attention. It's a real pity those visual heights couldn't find an equally interesting story to partner with, because Upside Down's plot is a real paint-by-numbers stinker. It's shallow, predictable, slow and empty, without a voice of its own. Terribly acted and even more terribly written, with zero chemistry between its star-crossed leads, it's borderline insufferable and often makes for great unintentional comedy. Worth a quick glimpse, but strictly for the visuals - I'd recommend you watch it on mute.
B0090SI4LU|4.0|I'm not a movie snob...er, connoisseur.  I just like being entertained and stuffing my face with popcorn.  This movie fit my criteria.  It's kind of like comfort food.  No surprises, and you know you'll like it, and it has a happy ending.<br /><br />All that said, I loved the book and was afraid of seeing how it was translated into film, but I think the writers and director did a pretty good job.  Stuff had to be left out, but nothing major.  The casting was good.  I would have done the eyes differently, special effects expert that I am, but that's really my only complaint. :)
B002GDM2UA|4.0|This is a review of a Region 2 disc so please ensure you have compatible equipment before you make a purchase. The Immortal Edition is the best version of Highlander available. This has the widescreen \\"director's cut,\\" with additional footage, director and producer commentary, Queen music videos (\\"Who Wants To Live Forever\\", \\"A Kind of Magic\\", and \\"Princes of the Universe\\"), a photo and artwork archive (includes Queen stills), the original trailer, and an official time line of the film's evolution from script to screen. The Blu-ray does not include the extra CD that came with the Immortal DVD (\\"Princes of the Universe\\", \\"One Year of Love ~Extended Version~\\", and \\"A Kind of Magic\\"). Avoid Highlander BD (Region 1) and Highlander Anniversary Edition BD (Region 1) because both contain only 6 minutes of deleted scenes for Highlander and an audio commentary. It would be great to get a deluxe US release with all the bonus content one day but for now this import is your best option.

B0091XRRQC|3.0|Love &#34;Shaun the Sheep&#34; and &#34;Wallace and Grommit&#34; so we thought we would give this a try.  Cute, but the best parts are definitely revealed in the trailer and most of the humour is geared towards adults.  Animation is very well done... as always.
B009346RSS|5.0|I have been using this product for a month or so and I am quite pleased. I was previously using a Grant Fidelity Tube DAC previously that ended up failing but this sounds very good. I was VERY skeptical about buying such a cheaply priced DAC but after using it, I really am impressed with how well this performs. If you have your doubts, it's cheap enough to give it a try!

B001993Y3G|3.0|Robin returns home from the Crusades to find his family murdered and the land under the control of the nasty Sheriff of Nottingham. This Blu-Ray isn't much of an improvement from the 2-disc special extended edition DVD. The additional 12 minutes of footage extended after the theatrical release remains incorporated into the film. It offers great audio but only average picture quality. It was a 5 star DVD release but without a good remastering and new supplements it seems light now (there is roughly 1 hour of bonus content and 2 audio commentaries). Some fans don't like the deleted scenes inserted into the main feature but if you haven't seen the extended edition yet it is worth a look. Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe share some dialogue and delivery problems in the lead role (in completely different versions of Robin Hood) but Costner's charm helps in this edition. The music, score and performances are otherwise excellent.<br /><br />Special Features:<br />12 Added Never-Before-Available Minutes of Footage Incorporated Into The Film (12 Min)<br />Network making-of documentary \\"Robin Hood: The Myth, The Man, The Movie\\" (1991; 32 Min) hosted by Pierce Brosnan<br />Vintage one-on-one interviews with the cast (19:29)<br />Score-only audio track with all-new Dolby Digital 5.1 Remix<br />\\"Weapons of the Time\\" 3-D gallery<br />Music video, Worldwide poster art gallery, Extensive production notes<br /><br />I rate this film 5 stars and the product 3 stars. A remastered version and a 3-hour documentary should be added for a future release.

B00EAI9CSY|1.0|I had high hopes for this one. I kept waiting for something to happen. For a vampire to kick ass. For someone to fly out of peril. I kept waiting to be amazed. I kept waiting for anything to happen. Suddenly everything wraps up with a cute bow and I was left wondering what happened.<br /><br />Nothing. Nothing happened at all.
0064471837|5.0|This is the novel that made me a reader.<br /><br />I read this novel for the first time almost 12 years ago. I've re-read it and the sequels Lirael and Abhorsen many times since that first read and I have never been less enthralled in the story.<br /><br />As a child I was not an engaged reader, but upon discovering this novel I became a regular of the sci-fi fantasy genre.<br /><br />What I like most is that this is one of the few novels I have read that are truly engaging fantasy stories with a female protagonist. I say this because, most female characters are either side characters, love interests of the hero, or protagonists of a story that spends too much focus on some form of love triangle; as compelling as the plot might be I find that the need to throw a love triangle in a story distracts the reader from the meaning, symbolism, or plot of the story.<br /><br />Even in my twenties, I still enjoy this novel as much as I had that first read through. And I am certain that I will enjoy it for more years to come.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Provides hours of entertainment. Totally addictive. Gets harder as you advance levels. My six year old son, and 74 year old father play it.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|The merits of the film itself go without saying but the blu-ray is breathtaking in its own right. David Lean's epic film shines in every frame. I have no problem saying that Lawrence of Arabia is one of the best looking catalogue releases available on the blu ray format. I myself can find no faults with the picture quality. The audio is on par with a lossless 5.1 DTS-HD soundtrack. Maurice Jarre's unforgettable score comes to life in a way that could on be surpassed by seeing the film in a high caliber theater. The special features are fine but unimpressive. All in all it is a must buy.<br /><br />If you want the most in depth L.O.A. experience then seek out the collector's edition. It's an additional 50-60$ but comes with an extra dvd packed with special features, a cd of the soundtrack, a L.O.A. coffee table book and a 70mm film frame from the movie. It's expensive but completely worth it for diehard Lawrence of Arabia fans.
B001AQO41E|3.0|Poltergeist was a fantastic film followed by two entertaining sequels. While the video and audio are great the extras are sadly lacking. The only featurette ever released by Warner Bros. was a 31-minute documentary \\"They Are Here: The Real World of Poltergeists Revealed\\" about real-life ghost hunters. In other words, this is a bare-bones release with no documentaries on the film, no deleted scenes and no director's commentary. There is so much to this film and franchise that hasn't been aired because of the issues over directing and the Poltergeist Curse. The vault is stuffed with Poltergeist material. Hopefully the 2014 remake will be followed by a beefed up special deluxe edition of the original masterpiece fully loaded with behind the scenes info.<br /><br />I rate the film 5 stars and this release 3 stars. Buy this Blu-Ray for the film only. The studio has hinted for years at a deluxe edition but it has never been released. I know it was partially completed and then scrapped because copies of it still float around underground. A 3-disc Poltergeist Trilogy (soon to be quadrilogy) with 5 hours of supplements would be amazing.

B0084670FU|4.0|I'm not sure what the author of this story was trying to get across, but for me it told the story of an America couple trying to renew their romance in a Muslim country and was involved in an accidental shooting, which then caused much grief for the couple, the shooter, their children's sitter and the previous gun owners. I assume he was trying to convey that 1 gun shot can cause much damage, but the fact that they were Americans, the couple did survive with some terrible memories, while the other's from poor countries, it changed their lives forever, if they lived through the ordeal.

B00B7Y0206|3.0|This app works as a great Youtube viewer. You can even read comments. For any of you who are wondering why you cannot sign in,it's because kindle 's don't come with Google play services. I would give this app 5 stars if it was completely free. But it's not. In order to download videos and get rid of ads (when you pause a video),you have to pay 1.99. Some might think the app is worth it to be able to view Youtube,but it's the same on the Internet. So,you can go ahead and get this app,but if you want to download anything,be willing to pay the price. However,there is another completely free Youtube viewer and downloader that I use called tubeFilr. Just check it out,I know you'll love it. It's on the Amazon Appstore also.
B004L3AQFG|5.0|I had seen Aron Ralston on TV and heard his story.  I was so impressed by him, his courage and his humbleness that it led to my search for the DVD. It is very graphic but that is the only way it could be if it was to be in line with his experience.  Not many could do what he did and I am so thankful that he had such great courage.

B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Despite some fairly critical reviews and only middling box-office performance, I found this to be a perfectly enjoyable, and occasionally surprising sci-fi film. I doubt it will ever be considered a classic but it has great actors, the now-commonplace amazing special effects, and an engaging story line. It is well worth a couple of hours to watch.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I'm not a huge Black Sabbath fan.  After their third album, I kinda lost interest. But after 2 score years, it's like they never left.  The music is hard and edgy and the soft bits only tend to remind you of the onslaught to come.  Ozzy's singing has never been clearer.  And while some people might shun this because of the lyrics, in my mind it represents the true spiritual battles waged all around us.  Don't bother with the 2 bonus songs making the track listing 13: they are not THAT spectacular, unless you just want to hear them....once.  Not bad, but it sounds like an add on to the creation itself, which is phenomenal!
B001DHXT6G|5.0|This is simply the best DVD set I have ever owned. Episodes interspersed with sound effects from the Bridge while showing iconic figures of the remaining episodes in the background, giving a preview of what's to come--very cleverly arranged. Highly recommended for yourself or as a gift for another.

0061053147|3.0|Paul Sammon's Herculean effort predates by a decade what was effectively the 25th Anniversary release of Blade Runner, 2007's [[ASIN:B0012PDVQ2 The Final Cut]]. Sammon's knowledge has never been in question; he is interviewed on the stellar three-and-a-half-hour documentary, Dangerous Days, available on two-, four-, and five-disc collections of that film. Cheesily, the publisher has pasted a \\"25th Anniversary of Blade Runner\\" pseudo-sticker on the front of this book, implying it reflects that most recent film release when it does not. Furthermore, and in extreme contrast to Ridley Scott, this paperback from It Books (a HarperCollins imprint) leaves much to be desired in terms of production. The text is too faint to be read easily in anything but optimal light, and the photo reproductions are embarrassingly poor. There's also typographic reproduction errors throughout, for example, the dates on page 10 and the unnecessary italics on pages 206 and 208.<br /><br />None of this is Sammon's fault. One could, however, take issue with the fanboy approach prevalent throughout the book. His apologist mantra is in evidence when he attempts to reconcile the small number of positive period reviews against the wall of sound that was critical press in 1982. A smaller issue, but one that smacks of laziness nonetheless: the author's inability to interview certain members of the cast. He first states that Morgan Paull (Holden) was sailing around the world; Future Noir took nearly three years to complete and surely a phone interview could have been scheduled at some point? Sammon later states that Joe Turkel (Tyrell) died and was therefore unavailable for interview; in fact, that actor is still alive even today.<br /><br />On the very much larger plus side, Future Noir is filled with production and script details that any Blade Runner savant-in-training will want to know. Again, however, the book's 1996 publication precludes the opportunity to tie up various loose ends, particularly the multiple versions of the film, e.g., International Cut, Workprint. As well, there are numerous points virtually screaming for updates. When screenwriter Hampton Fancher comments that he and co-screenwriter (and his replacement) David Peoples \\"never did really collaborate on Blade Runner,\\" one feels compelled to point out that one of the commentaries on the Final Cut DVD is an informative (and hugely entertaining) track from the Fancher-Peoples duo.<br /><br />There's so much material here (400+ pages) that it often gets repeated. Even the interview with Ridley Scott (Appendix A) is a composite of seven interviews over fifteen years! The lack of an Index doesn't help. The result is a sometimes rambling, incessantly glowing tribute to a film that will always be polarizing even if it is always remembered.<br /><br />Sammon needs to update his book and tell HarperCollins not to cheap out on the printing next time.the multiple versions of the film, e.g., International Cut, Workprint.

B005DJREGQ|4.0|I never watch MTV, but stumbled across this show on Amazon Prime. I found it compelling and very entertaining. The characters are exaggerated, but I guess I found them acceptable because they are so representative. I'm pretty sure I'm not the target audience, but I would recommend it to anyone.

B008QTVNUI|4.0|I think the main character of the Brody character is superbly acted. He is persuasive and believable. His wife is a little unbelievable in pretty much every way. Claire Danes is a little so-so in that her character seems almost like a characterization. Over-acted. Also, the romance between the two main characters is not convincing. The other great star is Mandy Patinkin. Steals every scene he is in. The story in general is engrossing - really good writers.

0143124544|4.0|I couldn't put this book down from the first page.  Funny thing is, I've never really believed in euthanasia, and I'm still not convinced.  But I understood why this man felt he had nothing to live for.  However, look at what his presence in Louisa's life did for her?  He had value, he had work left to do, he was loved--beloved--and personally, I just didn't want him to die.  The book did what books are supposed to do:  it made me think.  It made me start conversations about the issue.  I'm the mother of a twenty-eight year old man, and a thirty year old daughter.  I know that the author didn't make the mother very \\"warm and fuzzy\\" but she was paralyzed with grief and fear (please forgive the pun, I didn't intend it).  She couldn't possibly be light and love in what she was facing.  I want a sequel to this book...let us know what happened to Lou, and please in the sequel, give the mother a break and a way to find healing.

B00CKJTOHO|4.0|There have been good seasons and bad seasons. Season six was one of the worst. Season 7 is a lot better. BUT Debra Morgan's histrionics are getting extremely tiresome and boring. Jennifer Carpenter tries to give her character more importance than she deserves and by over-acting she makes her character not only overwhelmingly prosaic but unbearably annoying. If I could edit out all of Debra, the show would be perfect. Maybe she can go the way of Rita. Thank GOD they got rid of Rita. She was a dullard.

It was beautifully written, but definitely not my type of story.  However, I couldn't put it down.

B00C9SRN5Q|5.0|This is the Maxwell Staniforth translation, now nearly 50 years old but far smoother and readable than the Long translation in most of Amazon.com's editions. Long makes the Emperor sound like a pompous Victorian; Staniforth presents him as an introspective English gentleman. Unfortunately, Staniforth's Introduction and Translator's Note are omitted. Marcus Aurelius' dedication to reason and society are refreshing and moving in an age when neither is much valued, and his ruminations about God, life, impending death and how best to face them are calming and comforting. Given today's op ed atmosphere of raging intemperance and megalomania, we may have to retreat to the 2nd century to learn how to address frustration, bad behavior, and conflict with the gentleness inspired by knowing we are all in this together.

B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Like all Neil Gaiman works, this book is well written and has great characters.  Unfortunately, this whole book would have been just one of several threads in Gaiman's better, more complex novels.  If you get it, you'll have a good read but, if you're like me, you'll be disappointed when it ends.  As the song goes, you'll be thinking &#34;is that all there is?&#34;
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|The Giver was a good read. The ending left me wanting more though. Hard to imagine a world with no sunshine, no color, and no love. Sounds depressing to, but it's not.

B004132HZS|5.0|...as one of the best shows to ever air on television.  Amazing writing, directing, editing, score, and acting make this one a real winner.  The character portrayal is different than any I've ever seen, yet seemingly more true to the originals than any others despite its lack of Victorian setting. One of the most brilliant shows.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|This had a few good points in it.  The ending was a bit out of whack and not so believable.
B000000OMP|3.0|I was turned on to WS Slide It In in the eighties. I was an older cousin's copy which i found in the same stack of records that included Judas Priest British Steel. Great lineup on this including of course Coverdale on vocals, John Sykes of Thin Lizzy and Tygers of Pan Tang on Guitar and Neil Murray on bass and pounding skins, the legendary Cozy Powell. One of my favorites is Slow An Easy and also Spit It Out. Some of this sounds a wee bit dated now, but this album is a little more hard-hitting than that famous self titled Whitsnake from '87, u know da one, wit the pop single Here I Go Again.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|Yesterday I purchased this DVD from my local store since I love horror films where atmosphere, psychological and suspense filled terror can put fear into me. Also, using my imagination creates better fear and terror than all the gore in most modern horror movies can fill. Therefore, I was very disappointed that \\"Paranormal Activity\\" was such a big yawn that when the finale actually came I didn't even jump out of my skin.<br /><br />  As for what this film is about others have already written but what I finally realized that didn't work for me is that this is like the TV program, \\"Paranormal State\\", put onto film. For those not aware, \\"Paranormal State\\" is about a  bunch of Penn State students who investigate paranormal activity in various places. So, in \\"Paranormal Activity\\" not only do we have two truly green morons trying to solve what this haunting is about but they don't bother to know why and how it all started. They don't have proper tools to conduct paranormal research just the video camera trying to capture paranormal happenings. Big deal! The documentary style video journal really loses all the mystery and atmosphere trying so hard to be scary. Really, what would've made this production very interesting once the couple finds out from a psychic that a demon is haunting the girl specifically is to get to the bottom of things. However, it goes on and on like a broken record.

1422188612|2.0|I was expecting this book to be more tactical in nature.  Do this day one, do this day 30, etc.  In my opinion, this book was a little too academic and read like a thesis for a PhD.  I know others have loved it, but not quite what I had expected or was looking for.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|A fantastically written show performed by top notch actors. There is nothing I do not love about this show (except that there isn't more of it!)  I simply cannot wait for the next season to premiere!
B002KYHZLQ|2.0|I finished this book last night. Let me say I was somewhat dissapointed and was caught between a 2 and a 3....but I don't feel it was deserving of a 3.<br /><br />Like many others, I read a lot of the positive reviews and recommendations for this book online so I thought it would be a good series to get into. I even went into it with the understanding that not everything would be explained to me right off the bat. Parts of the book were interesting. There were plenty of imaginative ideas that were thought provoking. However, this book fell flat with me  on several levels.<br /><br />The characters were not that interesting. I didn't feel any depth from them. The only one I felt somewhat attached to was Tattersail. I felt like I was being tossed around from each point of view without understanding much of the characters' motivations for what they did. I felt like much of the book was written statically with very few instances of emotion. Almost like summaries of events that took place without much feeling.<br /><br />Another point is things seemingly come out of no where. No explanation. No rules. I felt like things were being made up as the author went. Random pivotal plot-turning characters and changes that had not been mentioned throughout the entirety of the book just suddenly popped up at the end. Someone just pulls a demon out of her bag with no previous mention of it existing. Someone uses magic they previously did not have. An entire warring culture is mentioned as a deadly threat out of thin air, and this is all at the end of the book. It was annoying to read. A root/tree/house/stump thing grows and is presented as significant while the reader is left in the dark about what the hell it is.<br /><br />I came here looking for a series similar to Game of Thrones, which has much more direction, and was disappointed. I liked the ideas in the book, but it was a mess - A big mess of good ideas that lacked explanation.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This app is a fun and easy way to relax and enjoy a puzzle. With vivid images and easy controls, it's a great way to kill some time.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Love love love this series. Cannot encourage anyone enough to take some time and read these. The author paints a beautiful scene of a world you can clearly picture in your mind and then challenges you to include magic and science to make everything come alive. If you enjoy LOTR and HP this series is definitely for you.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I loved it. I'm exited for the next and love the author!! I think this book Is by far the best romantic novel  EVER!!!!!😄😁
B00ECUARO8|4.0|I heard several reviews of this movie, all raving about Matthew McConaughey's performance and I can not fault it - it was solid, but I wouldn't say it was something he has never shown us before.  On the other hand, the young lead, Tye Sheridan, was outstanding, as was the script and overall craft of the film making which had a pacing about it that really drew me in.  Very much worth the rental.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Fun honest little book filled with experiences and allows you to see and experience your own. I read it as my morning book on my phone. Wonderful confirmation! The experiments work!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Ncis is the best show. I love all of the characters . Abby and Gibbs are my favorites. Tony and Zeva  are hot
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Love the characters, the story line and the music.  Perfect for anyone form old school TV who likes music, dance and drama.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Great sequel to the already great first book of this series. If you like LOTR and HP you will love this. It comes with the detail of Tolkien, but the whimsy of Rowlings. Thoroughly enjoyed this and cannot wait for the third!
B0087YYHZU|5.0|One of our all-time favorites.  &#34;You can't stand it!&#34;  That is you can't keep from enjoying this great musical stars.
0062255657|4.0|this book might be called a novel, but I cant compare it to American Gods or Anansi Boys .... those are novels that swing their hips and make room ... this is a long short story that sits itself down quietly for your consideration - a Coraline or a Graveyard book, though not as geared towards children.<br /><br />It's good, and if you are a fan this has some very Gaimanesque ideas .... but enough with the tid bits, Neil, I want a meal!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use this app on all my devices and i never leave home with out it and my umbrella of course
B000LJ9ZWO|5.0|I found the service and price extremely fair for &#34;Westworld&#34;.  This is a movie that was popular back in the day;  that by chance I found here on amazon.com.  It's a video that I wanted to see;  but not own.  It was fun for my wife and I to view Westworld today.  Because at the time;  Westworld was a futuristic film.  And we found it interesting to see how close the movie came;  to current technology.  I'm pretty sure that most &#34;Baby boomer's&#34;  Will really enjoy this video. :)
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Read the book when it first came out when I was in fourth grade and fell in love.  Since then anything that comes out related to this I am hooked (much like Harry Potter)
B007SGM084|5.0|Absolutely love love loved this book.  I read it twice already and loved it even more the second time around!  I dragged reading the last few chapters because I didn't want it to end! I could not put this book down.  I absolutely melt over the unconditional love and passion Christian has for this woman!  I think we all dream wish fantasize for that such love passion from someone.  We know reality is the odds are not t that great bit it definitely keeps hope alive for some of us that are waiting for that such spark with that someone.  If anything, it at least boosts my dwindling almost empty hope that I used to have that such love.  exists.  Plus I am from Seattle so that definitely helped! ;)  thank you for keeping my days excited with anticipation!!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Looking for my Christian Grey
B0094BB4TW|1.0|what the heck I keep trying to go onto this app and it says force close and it goes black sometimes the facebook symbol comes on but it fails to do so.it always goes to force close
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Best game ever my brother showed me it and so far I'm level 18. And I've got the pepper dragon.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|Been using TeamViewer for a while now way back when i had windows, and it works great. I now use it on mac mini and control it through iPhone, iPad and know Kindle Fire HD! so great when you leave the house and forget to do something on your home computer I can log on turn it on and no more worries.
B00AR1G3FS|3.0|This is a great band with a ton of great songs and at the height of their powers (1977's Hotel California period) they featured two excellent guitar players in Don Felder and Joe Walsh. Granted that Walsh has the edge over Felder as a writer and singer, but the two were really evenly matched and played and created together extremely well. Indeed they were the perfect vehicle for their own ideas and they helped make Henley and Fry's writing blossom into great recordings and ultimately into timeless fan favorites.<br /><br />Many will disagree and not even understand or care about Felder's absence. In my opinion, it is inexcusable. I avoided this tour and I only watched this when it was played on television.
B007AL48UK|4.0|Nice game of the same. Free app of the day, can't complain.  I always enjoy playing Mahjong, in any format.
1781162646|5.0|This book was really a good read. A bit of a throw back to old time crime novels with a touch of supernatural thrown in.
B00640UICA|4.0|Unique and Challenging.  HD Graphics are Cute and nicely designed.  Some Pleablins have different number of hands so it makes it more interesting.  There are also different type of Pleablins that do other things (like the stiff ones that have to be Rotated by tapping them to line up their hands properly.  It is a very Enjoyable low pressure game that keeps you busy and happy.<br />There are good Instructions, Nice Music and funny sound effects (sound levels can be adjusted).<br /><br />Overall, very Engaging and different type of game that is Fun and addictively satisfying.  I've seen No Annoyances so far and the only Addon is FLURRY Analytics (minus 1 Star for that).<br />NOTE:  You can play this with your WiFi OFF if you want.  That's what I like to do.<br />A uniquely Enjoyable game with good Replay Value.  It's a KEEPER for me.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|From  beginning  to end and enjoyable Rat tat tat...BOOM!!!<br /> Enjoyable cast!<br /> Just make the popcorn and enjoy the ride with Stallone and friends...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Not really into games anymore as i am getting older but, this game is just so old school had to try it and really glad i did so much fun
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Lana Del Rey has an excellent singing voice, and is extremely talented. Great album, would highly recommend purchasing this album.
B00821OX98|5.0|Really like the action and suspense. Pretty good acting. Has some unexpected twists and turns that keep us watching. If you liked the series &#34;V&#34;, you would probably like this too. On the whole, good sci-fi worth watching.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show, have been watching it since Season 1.  At first I wasn't sure that I would like it, but after watching the first or second episodes of Season 1, I was hooked.  My husband and I have watched the reruns many times.  Didn't like that Sybil died, but it was an intensive episode and wonderful acting. And looks like at end of Season 3 that Matthew will die, really hate that!  Anxious for 4th season to begin but I believe it will be Jan. 2014 before it starts.  Definitely a 5-star show!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Can't wait for the next book. Loved this book! I want more.....please hurry with the adventure. needing the next one !
B000GCFY0I|5.0|Very good book, interesting premise and amusing to see how they describe our world today in the future. Looking forward to the rest of the series.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|If you want total system cleaner look elsewhere for what it does and its free can't beat it. Get it
B00CHI5F5S|2.0|I read all the other reviews, but thought maybe it was a niche thing and I'd like it anyway. I didn't. This movie looks like someone was trying to piss off people that enjoyed 'The Untouchables;' every character was a poor imitation of one from that movie. If you feel the urge for a gangster flick, just go watch that one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game fun to play and also easy to play. The game is entertaining and it is also challenging the farther that you get in the game.
B007SGM084|5.0|There is something about the book that keeps you turning page after page. I loved it and have read it multiple times!!
0618918248|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. For those who have questions, I recommend this book for a thought-provoking analysis of the conflict between reason and religion. Dawkins is not prone to hyperbole, preferring instead to work with existing evidence while analyzing the arguments from both science and religion.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am not a big reader of Stephen King, for no particular reason just have not picked up many of his books. However, this one caught my eye and I read the reviews. It was fantastic. Incredibly interesting and nostalgic, he does a great job of bringing the reader back in time. A lot of interesting story lines, and in reality a very believable story (assuming you can suspend your reality and believe in time travel). Very long but very good book!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is very addictive and challenging,you have to really think about it.over all a very clever game and worth having a go.
B005HEPN06|5.0|While season 3 of Star Trek TNG is where the writing and acting gelled, season 4 continued the solid performance. By the fourth season, Data was no longer a quirky android, but a more human like character. Some of the best episodes capitalize on his character development.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|Lots of great information for personal growth that would really help a lot of people.  A must read for people.
B000HL0EEE|4.0|Although Enterprise is not my favorite trek series, it is good. Love the episodes that include the andorians.The theme song was awful at first, but has kind of grown on me.Worth watching!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This game is fun to play. I'm really enjoying it. I'm happy that I downloaded it. I recommend this game to anybody. It's fun to play.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Fun to play. Be careful buying coins or tickets. I tried to buy coins and was charged $19.99. No coins were applied to the game. I sent a email to support and no response has been given, still no coins applied, and no refund. DO NOT BUY TICKETS OR COINS. PLAY JUST THE FREE GAMES.
B003VANOFY|3.0|I first purchased this product back in 2012, the original headset lasted me about a year (I use it more than 12 hours a day for both work and gaming). I could understand how I could were out a headset in a year. I decided to purchase another one after my dog broke my mic (jumped on me and snapped the mic. I've had both game/work breaking issues with this one. After 4 months, the charging cord will not charge the headset, and on month 5, the headset will not hold a charge for more than 30 minutes, no matter how long I charge. Not only that, but as the headset turns off/on, it makes a loud beep that others can hear (skype for example). It's extremely annoying. Overall, I'm dissatisfied with this purchase, the firmware is completely inaccurate while the info it presents (charge time/level). Will not buy or recommend for extended use.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Glad I was not there! This was such a realistic depiction of the tsunami that it was brutal! But, had it not been, it would not be a realistic / true story.  Naomi Watts did a great job.  But, I think Ewan McGregor's performance is not given enough credit, nor is Tom Holland, the boy that plays the oldest son.  He too is incredible in this film!  What a great movie!  I was really impressed.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|This game was a bit dissappointing and I got stuck on a level and gave up. Not a great game
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Good graphics and don't have to spend extra so far to progress.  Haven't gotten any rare fish yet but my plants are still growing.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Very exciting movie, lots of action but not too much blood.  Good engaging story.  The best of the MI movies.
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|I like the older Kenneth Branagh version of Much Ado, but I LOVE this new spin Joss Whedon has given us. This movie has all the whit and class of Shakespeare but with a modern appeal and familiar representation that makes it very approachable and easy to understand.<br /><br />Two thumbs up for the fantastic acting across the board. This will be a movie we watch over and over again.
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|The movie was okay, but we went to see the play live at a local theatre and it was fantastic.
B009HUB40Y|3.0|this game is okay but it does get boring after awhile. wish it was more interesting to play at times
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I really like this show, characters are intense, very good show.  I can hardly wait for season two to begin, but will have to wait until it's on video as I don't have Showtime.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not a bad app to kill an afternoon. I have to agree with other reviewers about needing more instructions and levels though.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Really good story and charecters, I just found it a little draggy. It is a Teen book so that may be problem. My grandson loved it
B001NHNG64|5.0|I loved the story line but I am always able to guess the culprit causing all the hell and the mastermind.  Maybe because I read the same type of books and authors over and over again.<br /><br />There were quite a few spelling errors but I did not bookmark them.  Your proofing department needs to do a better job.  I am interested in doing that on some authors.<br /><br />Thanks and looking forward to the next one.<br /><br />Diana Wilson
B005OCFHHK|5.0|The movies are exactly what I expected.  There isn't a lot of extras, but all I want to watch is the movie itself.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I liked this game very much and played it for quite some time. Got stuck on a level and stopped
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I put these in the stairs inside my house because I don't like turning the lights on in the middle of the night they light up the entire area for me to see love these great buy!
B00632HWOG|3.0|I am happy with how easy I can navigate through my emails when this app works.  However, every couple of weeks, the app suddenly stops loading new mail, and I have to uninstall the app and reinstall it to get my current mail.  I did this today, as it was telling me my most recent email was from Aug 15.  Not sure what the problem is, but I hope they fix it!
B008Q0D32S|2.0|I thought Henry Fonda always played nice guys.  This was not an easy movie to watch. Pretty graphic for something of that time.
B007SGM084|5.0|who love this series--I felt it was a good read--will I want to see the movie they will make of this--no--but like most book to movies it always loses something--think davinci code---it was fun to read and I got this on my kindle so deliver was instant!
1439153663|5.0|I loved this book and could not put it down.  When you read it make sure you have time as you will want to keep reading to finish the book.  Can hardly wait for her next book to come out!!!
B00AR83PN4|3.0|this game is kind of boring. I was not very happy with it at all and only played it a few times
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Some objects are hard to find. But so far is a good HO game. Will rate again later. Have fun figuring out how to play.<br />After almost a week, I still like this game. But because there is a very big learning curve, longer solve times or an option for no time limits would be very helpful at the beginning. So far with patience I have continued to play every day.
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|In this installment they made things a lot more dramatic and slower than the first in the Star Trek reboot. It was a good movie just not quite what I personally would have expected. They did however try to further character development and also tried to tie in events from the first film with a couple of dialogues.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|This isn't Schindler's List or Spartacus. There are plot holes and things that make no sense, but it's still a fun movie I've watched multiple times. I'm not much of an acapella fan but the numbers were fun. Who doesn't love 80s hits mashups? The humor is raunchy sometimes and in some places oddly-placed but funny! The acting is average but Brittany Snow and Anna Kendrick kill it. They know they're in a silly movie and they don't take it too seriously. I recommend it for a night with the girls or one of those lonely Friday night ice cream and sangria kind of nights.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|These are the most dramatic and well acted shows ever done. I keep repeating myself but it is very poignant to see this<br />Kind of quality come to an end. A long solemn salute to Star Trek next generation. Perhaps one day.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun but challenging.  I hope they get more rooms... I could play this game all day.  The only negative thing is that the \\"pointer\\" has to be just so our it doesn't register.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! Can't wait for the next book!!! The ending left me wanting more more more!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Mario Brothers meet Ireland!! Super cute game I REALLY enjoy playing on my Kindle Fire...It takes a little bit to get used to using the control buttons, but otherwise, LOADS OF FUN!!
B001NHNG64|4.0|Plenty of suspense A page turner. No further comment at this time. It is a good book to read for men and women
B00499QUK2|5.0|I LIKE IT, KEEPS MY ATTENTION AND I LIKE THE WAY THEY DID SHERLOCK HOLMES IN MORE MODERN TIMES, IT MAKES YOU THINK.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This movie will change the way you think of food! It's better to know what's really happening, then to be left in the dark. Ignorance is NOT bliss when it comes to your health and the health of your loved ones!  I would highly recommend that everyone watch this movie!
B00457WZEI|5.0|This book is a good time killer. And is also a good book. I like it because the horse has so many owners.
B0039O8AQK|5.0|This is by far one of my most favorite movies. I can watch it over and over again.<br />I think it is a good reflection of the book.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great app. Everything you need to plan your days outdoors. Easy to work with and graphics help you quickly see hourly through weekly forecast.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|Hard to rise to the level of Jane Austen but a good try.  If you are really a fan, you'll like it.
0375869026|5.0|My son read this is in school and at home.  As a special needs kid, he related to this story and his teacher did a wonderful job teaching it.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I use these in my Marathon training and these are the best headphones I've ever had. They don't move around and don't annoy me while I run.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this app is very very addicting<br />your child will want to play this app all the time<br />you collect your points, with the money you get on the game you can buy animals.<br />and when you reach level 21 you get the weasle that is trying to cut the ice to get to diano world, and at 35 you unlock DIANO WORLD witch is aweso.<br />and every day you get a dayly bonus.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Would give this game a better rating if you could actually play the game more.  I do not buy coins to play any game and with this game you can only play 2-3 hands a day if you're lucky.  Love the game of uno though.  If the app would give you more play time I would definitely give it a 5 star rating!!!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I like it so much, and can't wait for the real zombie invasion.  Wow I can't think of any thing else to write.  Whew,  that's enough.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|SAVED ME A LOT OF TIME AND MONEY.  I WATCHED IT AT HOME WITH MY FAMILY AND  MY HUBBY DIDN'T HAVE TO BUY ME EXPENSIVE COLA AND POPCORN!
B00004Y6NW|5.0|I really like all the stuff Dire Straits created in their glorious solid Rock career....But in their beginning, they were AMAZING!!!! This one, their debut(1978) and Comunique(1979) are simply brilliant.....Mark Knopfler´s voice and lyrics are inspired and the band flow with perfect Rock with some Blues and Reggae....They achieved more success with Making Movies and Brothers in Arms, but the first 2 are by far their best!!!! Totally ,completely recommended!!!! This one is a Masterpiece!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I saw both RED and RED II, both very entertaining.  I am looking forward to RED III, that would be a nice trilogy.
B000FBFN1U|1.0|I've just given up. Got excited through the first two, really irritated how no loose ends are ever tied up, read the reviews on 4 and 5, and honestly just ran out of patience.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I was excited to put an alarm clock onto my Kindle.  I should have remembered-you get what you pay for.  It's okay-accurate, etc., however, the sounds are lame and NOT very loud.  When I've tried using the alarm, it doesn't wake me up.  Will continue to use my cell for a travel alarm!
B009EHDU7U|4.0|We always think when someone reaches 90+ that they suddenly somehow become a perfect person with a perfect background.  Not so with fella!  An enjoyable read.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love this game. The only problem is that there are no shortcuts to locations you already unlocked. Overall it's a really fun game. I have finished it and playing it over. I highly recommended it. It's worth the money.
B00004Y6NT|5.0|Comunique in my opinion, is the best album from the Rock legend Dire Straits.....I got all their albums, and they´re all great, really....But their debut and this one are really something....I really like Making Movies, Love over Gold and the huge classic Brothers in Arms, but Comunique is simply a perfect collection of raw beautiful Rock songs with some Reggae and Blues all over....Mark Knopfler´s lyrics are brilliant and the band was totally inspired!!!! Try all the Dire Straits stuff, but their earlier days are among the best music of all time!!!! Masterpiece!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Harvey and Mike are a great team...what a balance of these characters! This show will be a classic and one that will be watched for years.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I elves this app! the graphics are perfectly done and the puzzles are hard, hut not too hard, so the game would be perfect for any age!
B008XG1X18|4.0|Love the pinterest app. I'm super addicted to interest!! Love everything about it! Could not be happier with the app
1451695195|3.0|He used a lot of vocabulary that I didn't understand. I wouldn't recommend this book. If you are looking for a good Heaven book, read &#34;Heaven is For Real&#34;.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I have tried downloading this app several times; Each time I try to log in I get &quot;not responding&quot;.  Would love a full version, but not much good if it<br />Doesn't work:(
1741797802|5.0|Disregard negative remarks of LP guide books by Kindle readers.<br />People who travel with Kindles are not real travelers. The image of them walking through some third world village, Kindle in hand, is too ludicrous to visualize. Most travelers travel to get away from freeways, money grubbibg cultures,fast cars, discos and Kindles!!<br />I've solo traveled through more than two dozen countries on four continents and wouldnt be caught dead with a Kindle. If I could take only one item with me to a remote place it would be a Lonely Planet guide book.<br />DH Koester[[ASIN:1478710152 And There I Was Volume IX: A Backpacking Adventure in India]]
B009VLXWRC|3.0|It see med fake.  I wouldn't suggest this to anyone who is interested in history.<br />Children should definitely not see it.
B001AQQR2S|4.0|My grand daughter likes to watch this movie. She is 6. It's a good choice for her. She likes it.
B007N31XTY|5.0|Was a great show in standard dvd but in Blu-Ray it rocked. Plus got a digital copy to watch wherever I go.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|&#34;Life of Pi&#34; has the same unexpected pleasure as that of &#34;Big Fish&#34;!  The graphics, visual effects, and fantasy are beautiful.  The only drawback for me was not being able to always understand the story-teller (Pi), but it still was an amazing movie.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great book! So much attention to detail!  If you're interested in the HBO series, I'd highly recommend reading the books along the way. I watched the first 3 seasons before starting the books and found myself re-watching the first season as I made my way through the book.  I'm sure I'll be staring book 2 tonight.
B00D8WIWQG|3.0|I had a very hard time downloading this song Bruises to my Music list.  No picture of album was with some or artist name.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|The author wrote a wonderful book and I believe that the producers, directors, and writers did their best to stay with what the author vision the drama to be.  It is next when you do not guess what will happen next.  So thank you all for the wonderful work of art.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|New character that I really love. Fun characters and bright colors and the stars make this movie. Check it out.
0345803485|5.0|I have read the entire series 4 times and never get tired of it. The story was interesting very sexy and hot!  I would suggest every man read this book as well as women. After reading this book you want a guy like Christian Grey. Always wondering what was goin to happen next. Recommend this book to EVERYONE!!
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Why I liked this book is whenever I read it,I start to laugh when I read a funny line,ha!.I have no comments only likes:I like the pictures,the comaty and the rest. I give this book 5 stars
B005R32L66|5.0|What's there more to say. It works great. Once set up it is easy to use. The app is very convenient
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I enjoyed laughing during this movie as well as cheering for the zombies to regain their humanity.  I believe everyone would enjoy this sweet love story.
B0010V4S2O|5.0|I love this film. Its one of those cartoons I can watch over and over again with my son. Great for parents.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Love her videos.  She is very motivating.  Great price!  Definitely recommend.  Need to keep using this to lose the weight though.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Some where along the way, feminists got a bad rap. Perhaps because sexism has changed from something that was straight up in your face to something far more subtle, no one thinks we need feminists anymore. WRONG!<br /><br />If the elections in 2012 taught us anything, it's that the US needs more feminists. With the likes of Todd Akin and the &#34;personhood&#34; type bills that keep cropping up, the overriding message our daughters are sent is that women are too ignorant to be trusted with the control of our own bodies. They are taught that their bodies are gross and should be hair free! (Thank you porn industry for that last one!)<br /><br />Caitlin Moran writes with a fresh voice that the younger generation will enjoy, but it is a positive message for all women who will be able to relate to many of stories of her life thus far.
0064471837|5.0|I remember buying this book on a whim - it was not long after it had been published the first time - because it had a great cover, and an intriguing, but not too filled with spoilers, description. And it had a female protagonist.<br /><br />All things in this review is written from my point of view, with my opinions. It's perfectly all right to disagree! I urge, however, as always, a reflexive and critical mind when reading the book. And the reviews, of course.<br /><br />We meed a Sabriel who is quite sure of herself, who knows her way around magic as well as the mundane world. Well educated, reasonably well behaved and prepared for her future.<br /><br />Except, things change, and the character suddenly realises she isn't as adult, well-prepared or skilled as she thought - she'll just have to learn, and push on anyway. And I loved that part: too often, protagonists whine, or know all they need to, or don't know but learn in a miraculously short time. This book is different. It is different in many aspects, and I love them all. Nix doesn't write the reader on the nose, especially not about the world we step into. That unfolds as the book progresses (indeed, as the two books following this one, too, progress), but to me, it never felt stilted or artificial.<br /><br />We meet a world where \\"necromancer\\" is so very different from everything at least I have met before (and after, as it is now long since it was published, and I have re-read and re-listened it several times - do yourselves a favour, by the way, and listen to the audiobook; Tim Curry does a stellar job!), and the people of the Old Kingdom know that death is not necessarily the end - though that's seldom a good thing.<br /><br />The world is new and exciting, the protagonist feels believable (to me), we don't have to suffer a damsel in distress, there's no rape (thank the heavens, that trope is much over-used), the gender-issue so often found in fantasy (and other!) books is pretty much absent - gender exists, but doesn't appear to matter much to Nix. Anyone can be anything, which is a relief and, I suppose, to some, it must be a shock when they read \\"she\\" about a guard or otherwise \\"norm-ally\\" male character option.<br />I find the book does quite a good job at building up suspense, dragging you in and letting you follow along for the ride. The wonderfully dry-mannered cat, and its \\"inexplicable catness\\" is also quite a lovely new thing to run into.<br /><br />I have read and listened to the book with a privilege-conscious ear/eye, and found it refreshing in that aspect too. Not perfect, certainly not, but far better than very nearly everything (yes!) else I've read.<br /><br />I do believe that there may be a bit too much re-action, rather than pro-action, for some. It never bothered me, because I found it to be believable. Also, some have expressed their hesitancy over the protagonist being female. This, in my opinion, might stem amongst other things from all the oh so bad representations of females in other literature.<br /><br />In all, I was happy about all those things that I have heard other raise critical voices about. You cannot read this book expecting to be fed with a silver spoon, it is far better to think for yourself. I am very happy it was published, all those years ago, and I am very happy I stumbled upon it. It has a place of honour on my special bookshelf, and I recommend anyone who is interested in fantasy (and, perhaps, steampunk - Ancelstierre is quite different indeed from the Old Kingdom), to give it a try. It does, in my opinion, deserve its stellar reputation.ists, but doesn't appear to matter much to Nix.

B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I believe that Tom and Mr. Freeman makes the movie so wonderful.  The movie was never boring and kept you guessing what was really happening and the past answered a lot of questions.  Nicely done to the writers and to all the actors.
B00005JKHN|1.0|I refuse to give a bad review to anyone but in the future maybe check your product a little closer for damaged
B000SEGTI0|5.0|Philip K Dick is a fantastic science fiction author, and this is a great place to start if you're unfamiliar with his work.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It's SO good.  The characters, the setting, the dialog, the intrigue, the plotting.  Need I go on?  Suffice it to say, this is a grand series.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I am enjoying this game because of the fact that it is a game that is kind of like Bubble Mania. LOVE the high quality of the graphics. I especially like the fact that each level is challenging, but not too challenging. I think that I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes Bubble Mania.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I had been having space problems on my Kindle Fire and I needed to get rid of junk files. Did the job wonderfully. Really satisfied!
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Bought it not just for my daughter (22-months old) for my kindle while in the car, but also for myself. I love this movie! So cute and my daughter can watch it over and over again!
B005LJITS0|4.0|It is better that I thought considering reviews. It covers the essentials and sets up sinestro and the yellow ring.
B004LWZW88|5.0|my kids love this movie, they can watch it repeatedly. Its very entertaining for adults as well, as i enjoyed it too.  Especially if ur a cat lover.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Not only did this novel keep you on a good adventure but it was so interesting as to the India society and culture.  Great book!!!
159463176X|5.0|Khaled has done it again! When he puts pen to paper it truly turns to gold! I can't put this story down.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Works great so far although I've only used it once.  Just loaded it and printed a pdf document with no trouble!
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Yes, it is S-F in the way the whole story is built,but what a fun to read.<br /><br />Still cannot believe that Larsson did not live to fully enjoy the success of his trilogy, sounds as surreal as the way his story is compelling...
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This is my favorite version of les mes. We saw it on the stage and the voices are NOTHING compared to this version. So much talent, so beautiful, I love it.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|I really love this show,and having read the first 4 books,given their breath and enormity i've come to really appreciate the TV writers(Dave,Dan,Lord Martin of course and co)ability to judiciously edit and compress to faithfully distill the essence of the source material.Of course to quote Lord Martin \\"the show is the show,and the books are the books\\". The twists and turns politically and otherwise lay a fertile ground for fans to proffer their own \\"theories\\" for this magnificent \\"work in progress\\"(Lord Martin is still writing)and as a fan I'm no different.For example,I subscribe to the Rheager-Llyana=Jon Snow camp.And the what I call the \\"red herring\\" when at the bedside of Bran(Episode 2)Queen Cersei mentions to Catelyn Stark that her firstborn was a dark haired boy who was taken from her presumably dying and later we meet the King's \\"Bastard\\" son Gendry whose only memory of his mother is that she had golden hair.A stretch to be sure but with the palate this guys have created not out of the realm of possibility.The acting is superb,direction sets the tone and most importantly we believe. Technically the color transfer is excellent(I won't quibble over the fleeing ranger bit in the beginning of EP 1),audio is terrific and I know I'm preaching to the choir when my recommendation cannot be higher. Oh,btw I hum the music.
B00D6M86RS|4.0|A fun and addictive game testing your pinball wizardry along marvel`s greatest heroes. Additional game boards must be purchased and that's a bit of a draw back but overall a great game with fun and varied game boards.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|We love this movie! Romance, wisdom, culture, and a great cast!  Really draws you in and gives a taste of India through the eyes of these mature characters.
B000FVE3BG|2.0|It looks great in the picture but the gold looks cheesy & cheap -- and the leather in the band seemed like it had dried out. I don't expect the best of the best for $100 but I expected much more than this. It almost looks like costume jewelry. I had a faux-lex years ago that had a better gold tone than this. This does not measure up to the other five Invicta watches I've had.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo Blitz is awesome.  Great on the Kindle Fire and on the internet.<br />It can become very addicting.<br />It's the best online bingo game there is.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Great music, storyline, and graphics. Becomes progressively very challenging. The narration isn't overwhelming. Plus there's an extensive options list to modify the experience.
0739432176|5.0|Here is a review that I wrote in 2011 on my own journal:<br />-----<br />I cannot choose my favorite amongst these books. [[ASIN:0064471837 Sabriel (The Abhorsen Trilogy)]], [[ASIN:0060005424 Lirael: Daughter of the Clayr]] , and [[ASIN:0060528737 Abhorsen (The Abhorsen Trilogy)]] all touch me in a different way, and, as a trilogy, are my favorite book(s). I remember when I first read Sabriel: a borrowed copy from a high school friend. I was instantaneously hooked on them. I sought to read the whole series and - at one point - owned a large, all in one, copy that I have since lost, and desperately want to replace. I've spread the word to those I know about the series in hopes to spread the word to those who had not heard of it, so that others could join the love not only of the written word itself, but of the characters: Sabriel, Touchstone, Lirael , Mogget, etc.<br /><br />I've been known to quote a line from the series that seems to fit in more places that I would have originally thought: Coils within Coils, Fleas upon Fleas, Idiots begetting Idiots.<br /><br />Those who have not read this series. DO SO!<br />-----<br />Since then I've reread the book twice and have lent it to my best friend, who also loved it. I've read this book 4 times since I purchased the book and each time I find something new that I missed. Even though I can open it to a random page and know what's going on, the book enraptures the mind. It's definitely a page-turner; before you know it you'll finish pages and chapters.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Best of class.  Started a new generation of tv show.<br />Still a classic show worth watching every few years.  Great stuff.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Instead of being strictly a educational book on how to improve the processes of IT processes going more towards a DevOps culture. This book is a fictional story that will likely sound like many companies' experiences. Telling your past, present and potential future. If you are in IT you will be able to really identify with this book.<br /><br />I ended up buying three additional copies and gifting them to people where I work.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|Liked the ending. Sort of a slow book and very improbable but a fun read. Best par  is def the road  trip.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This story was so amazing. I couldn't help but cry at the end. What makes it so cute is the fact that a dog is telling the story. :D
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is perfect if you are stuck between flights at the airport!  you can't beat a free puzzle game.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Man, I can't say I liked it, I have to say I LOVED it. The whole book is like a long mantra, it has a bunch of little phrases that show you the meaning of everything. The book doesn't show an opinion...it shows you the truth (and that's an option in itself). You read this book, and you hope, you truly hope that this story isn't just a fiction book: one that you can read, and just put up on the shelf. You hope it isn't just over. But as TFIOS says: you die in the middle of a sentence, or a paragraph, or a book; like in AIA.<br /><br /> After a while, you expect to lose your sense of emotion-ness when you retread a book. That is a complete misconception. My theory is: after you've read a book twice, ten times, twenty times, if you still get that feeling of heartache, that feeling of joy, if you still cry (not even at the very end, but in the middle, because you know the characters's happiness only lasts so long), then you know, you know that book is THE book.<br /><br />The book you remember forever.
B008220C38|5.0|I was expecting a typical love story when I saw this but it was so much more than that. What a brilliant movie and the songs are really catchy too. Keira Knightley was superb as always and I was really happy to see her and Matthew Macfayden on screen together again. Jude Law and all the rest of the crew did amazing as well. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend it. Watch it and make your own opinion. I seriously don't know how people found it dull and say the story line jumped around too much. It was brilliantly made.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great short game, not too difficult, not too easy. Really enjoyed the game and can't wait for more rooms :)
B004RKXHZY|5.0|LOLA isn't the cookie cutter heroine of this story, that is what I love about it. It isn't la.di.da always doing the right thing, having the characters do what the reader wants to happen. Lola makes mistakes but many mistakes all of us make in real life. This story is so plausible and will connect with you in some shape or form in your life. Set in San Fran this story is magical. It took me to a place in high school where every teenage girl believes they are with the love of their life and there is no telling any different.  It was a great escape to sit down and enter Lolas. Through her mother's unfortunate set backs to her older husky rock and roll boyfriend to the next door twins. This is a great read that will keep your heart warm and your mind racing.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Grew up watching the original and followed up with each new entry into the franchise. So....die hard Trek fan. And I loved the second installment into the JJ Abrams reboot. Looking forward to more!!
1878424114|5.0|Simple Easy way to follow Deepak Chopra's Teachings. A Must Have. Lets you have a new Law everyday of the week to study.
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|Easy download cute app. I'm a bit confused as to the players and how to play.  I guess when I feel like punching something I can just play this app.Lol
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I thought this was a great movie for kids AND adults. Thoroughly enjoyed watching it with my grandchildren. I am seriously going to get Despicable Me 2. Very well done, funny, and with a nice solid moral.
B004V9MU86|4.0|I enjoyed how this book was written from deaths perspective. I also liked how it was a story about WW2 from the perspective of the everyday German, rather than the usual perspective of the Jews.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|This is a really good show. Excellent cast. Always touching the boundaries of morality vs obligation vs the need to win. Highly entertaining.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I need to purchase some more episodes for sure! :) It has a great story plot that and very good actors as well.
B00A44HRG2|2.0|It's hard to find anything of interest. A lot of the pictures are VERY low quality. Just not the quality I was expecting.
B008Y5UADK|3.0|I like the photography in Pi. I couldn't get into the plot. The photography was fun and interesting. I liked the little girl who kept asking math questions.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love this game.  I like the puzzles as well.  It's easy to advance to the next level.<br />Melissa, Wash DC
B0032KNA4I|3.0|The movie is great, but I was disappointed since no other languages than English included in the disc. No subtitles either.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|It's fresh and creative!!! Great opening song! Amazon cloud player is easy to use and you can export your songs to itunes to download them on your ipod...etc.
B0015DROBO|5.0|The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is the most intriguing and spellbinding story out there! You get caught up in the story immediately and don't want to leave it. You'll root for both Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomqvist! If you don't love it, then you should probably stick to the easy stuff like Danielle Steel or keep watching Murder She Wrote.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I am so glad I downloaded this app.  It works with your kindle allowing you to access you collection from anywhere.  It also asks you if you want to go to the furthest page read on whichever device you have been on most recently.  So far it works great and I have had no problems.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|I feel that the game star girl is so involved with making it as a star. I love that in the game u can have many famous boyfriend
B00C2IPB66|5.0|I like the steel box and it is what I was expecting. I would recomend this presentation and it was a great price!
0316017930|5.0|Outliers was such a well crafted Sociological treatise on the questionable assumptions made  for future success for determining successful future performance in many fields of endeaver from athletes to musicians, pilots of aircraft and  entreprenuers, to name a few. His perceptive studies resulted in an expanded comprehension of the underlying factors of success. His mention of ten thousand hours invested in outstanding success preparation was certainly alofty goal, but total dedication is to be recognized and respected. Enjoyed his work. It was most thought provoking.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This series is simply wonderful! If you haven't read them yet, get to it! They present characters you've never read about before in a story that you've never heard before. The only drawback (if it can be called that) is that you have to read all of the books and you have to read them in order. This is less of a series and more of a single story divided into sections. However, it's a story that you'll love and get completely invested in. It would be nice to see these characters (Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomqvist) in a television series. It would certainly rival the greats like Law & Order and CSI.
B003VXMMTK|1.0|The acting is ok. I just hated the whole story line. It was to tragic for my taste. If you want a British movie of this era I would go with Pride & Prejudice or any movies based from Jane Austen that's more uplifting. It's even more tragic than Charlotte Brontes Wuthering Heights.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like minecraft because it has all kinds of things you can get from monsters or you can get it from monsters. The only flaw is that... well there is no flaw and I would recommend it for everyone who has the patience to build things!
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Good product, good movie! My baby love the movie and he ask for the movie each time I'm at home. A lot of extra stuff
030789701X|5.0|Everything you want to know about Skyrim -- EVERYTHING -- is in this beautiful massive book. It's a superb edition, and it's comprehensive and well-produced.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|If you have not read this series yet, start now! Stop reading this review and pick up the book! The most interesting and entertaining story I have read in years! It's completely unusual (at least in the American market) and completely worth however long it takes to read all 2000 or so pages. (for the entire trilogy).
0671449028|5.0|this is such a cute book.  you can't go wrong with a sandra boynton book.  i love reading this to my son before bed and pointing out all the animals and colors
0345803485|5.0|I ordered the book having read so much about it.  Although I have not read it as yet, I am sure I will love it.  If I do not, I am sure that someone else will.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The minute this shipped, I received my Netflix discount code in an email.  I was already paying for Netflix so I saved $24.  I already have a Roku box and a \\"smart\\" Blu-Ray player.  I got this little guy because it looked cool.  It's a toy so I can stream You Tube from a browser vs a crappy app.  However, what I never thought of was Netflix, I usually search on my laptop or the iApp for something to watch via Netflix because the interfaces on streaming devices is just so awful, with this little guy, I have no need for those devices. I can use the iPad/iPhone or laptop to search and stream.  I may even give Hulu a whirl whenever I remember it exists.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game.  While I looked forward to escaping from each floor, I was a bit sad to know that I was completing the game and running out of floors.  I must admit that the pyramid on the  6th floor was challenging, and I had to read a review comment to break the code.  Otherwise, I escaped from all the floors on my own.  Great fun!
B00B9366VO|5.0|you are going to love this doc.  To see the history behind the studio, the soundboard and the bands that made history in that studio is awesome!
067144901X|5.0|i just love rhyming books.  my son is only 3 months old he seems to like it....he sits long enough for me to finish it without getting fussy =)
0385349947|5.0|The book is excellent, and has allowed me the opportunity to hold lively book discussions with various groups of professionals.  I love that it simply does not apply to women although it is whom it primarily speaks to.  This book offers a great opportunity for both men and women to engage in discussions that can expand both genders perspectives and enrich our understanding of how we currently interact and how we can enrich our interaction going forward
B004FHBO9K|4.0|Great vinyl sound. decent record. not one of my favs, but at $9.99 how could anyone resist?  Ten year anniversary double LP reissue on 180 gram vinyl for $9.99?  Yes please.
B003JTHWPA|1.0|what a waste of money. It was depressing and disgusting. Kept reading hoping it would improve, never did. Don't waste your money.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Game is so much fun ! Wish our was transferable to other devices tho so I can play on my phone and my kindle!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Great Alarm!!! I like where you can change the color theme. It gradually gets loud and doesn't shock you awake. The snooze is great as well. I have it set for 10 minutes. And it's FREE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
B009LA1QW6|5.0|I listen to this over and over again. Lana has a wonderful voice and compelling arrangements. Her unique style is an interesting combination.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Lots of wicked twists and makes it hard to figure out who the good guys are...oh, wait...there are no good guys!
1451695195|5.0|Eben Alexander is a DOCTOR - a specialist - a Neurosurgeon - a brain surgeon - who did NOT believe in life after life - heaven and hell - he BELIEVES NOW because he's been there done that! I highly recommend this book for proof of heaven because this doctor actually died, went to heaven and came back to earth so he could let people know that God is real and Heaven is Real - very interesting book - there are many out there of this kind and a lot are good in fact excellent and this book is one of the excellent ones out there. I also saw Dr. Eben Alexander interviewed on a talk show and he truly now believes. Highly recommend.
B004J4X32U|5.0|I love the way the book integrates brain science into practical ways to connect with and teach/discipline children. I would recommend this to anyone who works with kids
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|A very fun band easy game plus it was very mind gaining it just sucks you right in<br /><br /> I love this game so much!!!!!!!!
B0099114WO|3.0|[There are two \\"Hope Springs,\\" so be sure which one you want before buying.]<br /><br />A 2012 American drama \\"Hope Springs\\" stars Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones as Kay and Arnold Soames, a married couple of 31 years. Dissatisfied (sexually, I mean) with her life, Kay buys a book written by a marriage expert Dr. Feld (Steve Carell), signs up for an intensive one-week marriage counseling session with the doctor, and travels to Great Hope Springs, Maine, with her reluctant husband, who would rather be watching golf on TV.<br /><br />\\"Hope Springs\\" is often referred to as a romantic comedy, but I think, to most viewers, the film looks more like a filmic adaptation of a serious stage drama. During the session Dr. Feld calmly asks Kay and Arnold most embarrassing questions. Don't expect anything overtly comedic here. Steve Carell delivers a muted, low-key performance, bringing little to the role. Blink your eyes and you will miss Elisabeth Shue. The film's focus is always on Kay and Arnold Soames, struggling to keep the marriage going.<br /><br />The best part of the film is cast-against-type Tommy Lee Jones and his fine performance. Were it not for the final ten minutes (together with the end credits that are certainly amusing), I would give the film three stars or even more. Directed by David Frankel of \\"The Devil Wears Prada,\\" \\"Hope Springs\\" plays it too safe, despite some honest commentaries on marriage and sex.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Chromecast advertises that netflix is available. That is not accurate. Netflix online uses MS silverlight which is not compatible with chromecast. So netflix is not able to me. This leave youtube LOL big deal
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Such a good game. Much better than 100 floors. More levels please!!!! I'll definitely consider getting the paid app if enough levels are added. Loved these first 10! Can't wait for more.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I really enjoy this game. The different levels will keep you busy for hours! So far I haven't had any problems with it, even when I was playing the free version.
B00DB624GS|4.0|Second you say? Then read on......In the dawning days of CD, some of the WORST came from the WEA (Warner-Elektra-Asylum) Group. There was such a fuss over some of their terrible sounding discs that they eventually did something, but as usual with major record companies they did it half-a**ed.  Elektra and Asylum began to remaster their best selling catalog artist's CDs, Joni Mitchell, Jackson Browne, The Doors and so on, but most were just put on the market quietly with no fanfare. To add to the confusion, their packaging remained the same except for a few here and there that had small stickers that said \\"Digitally Remastered.\\"  The only way you could definitely tell were from the new remastering credits in the booklets and, along the inner ring of the CD itself where the code numbers are, there would be an added 'RE-1.\\" Warner Brothers followed suit, but they didn't even bother to sticker their product, which takes us to the explanation of the title of my review. The first release of this great album was a hissy mess, reviled by all, and with good reason.  Somewhere down the road Warner went back and remastered this along with some of the other FLEETWOOD MAC CDs of the albums following this. Warner also made it difficult to tell if you had the remastered version, they all had the \\"RE-1\\" code in the inner ring of the CD, but a few didn't have any remastering credits in the booklet, it was hit and miss. The first remastering of 'THEN PLAY ON' was an improvement, the hiss wasn't as prominent and the separations were clearer.  This new 2013 issue is again a SLIGHT improvement, which tells me that they're dealing with hissy masters, so this is the best I think you're going to get. At least they didn't smooth everything out with DNR, and the CD sounds pleasing with no evident \\"brickwalling.\\" With the original UK track listing, the bonus of both sides of the \\"Oh, Well\\" and especially \\"The Green Manalishi (With The Two-Pronged Crown)\\" singles and the informative booklet (with pictures of the master tape boxes), they've done it right this time. I wish the liner notes touched on the rumour that there's a 20 minutes plus outtake of \\"Rattlesnake Shake,\\" but the rumour also goes that both \\"Madge\\" instrumentals were part of said outtake. That theory is shot down by Mick Fleetwood's tales of recording them in David Fricke's liner notes. Another reviewer also stated that the nine minute version of \\"Oh, Well\\" on the older CDs was a mistake, that the single version combined was only eight minutes long.  He's mistaken however, both sides of that single add up to eight minutes and 47 seconds, only 16 seconds shorter than the combined version used on ALL the CDs. Now we can only hope for re-remastered versions of 'KILN HOUSE,' 'MYSTERY TO ME' and 'FUTURE GAMES'......<br /><br />A NOTE: Warner Music Japan has released the FLEETWOOD MAC albums from '[[ASIN:B00DP4M7EU THEN PLAY ON]]' to 'HEROES ARE HARD TO FIND' on SHM-CD in mini-LP sleeves.

Featuring fifteen rare TV performances, some mimed but many live, the video is a MUST for fans of this era of the group. If you can find one now prices are astronomic, but if you ever run across a copy or can afford it the performance are mind-boggling......<br /><br />ADDENDUM #2: \\"The Original FLEETWOOD MAC: The Early Years\\" DVD is now again available in the reissue of [[ASIN:B003LYMJ5Q THE VAUDEVILLE YEARS OF FLEETWOOD MAC: 1968 to 1970 (reissue)]].'  This reissue does NOT contain the thick booklet noted in the mention of it's previous incarnation below.  Also, in the review section there are opposing views comments stating the DVD will and will not play in U.S. drives. Proceed at your own risk......<br /><br />ADDENDUM #3: To be completely honest, instead of editing my original review I'm correcting my information here regarding the two \\"Madge\\" instrumentals. As H. Walen states in his comments, there IS a full length version of \\"The Madge Sessions\\" on the 'MEN OF THE WORLD' set.  I would like to point out though, that the 'MEN OF THE WORLD' set is a bargain compilation of material from three other sets, '[[ASIN:B00005UK0G THE VAUDEVILLE YEARS OF FLEETWOOD MAC: 1968 to 1970 (original release)]],' '[[ASIN:B000057BG3 SHOW-BIZ BLUES: 1968-1970]]' and '[[ASIN:B00F0MX95G BOSTON.]]'  The first two sets come in nice digi-books with copious notes and photos, and the latter, which was previously released on three separate discs ('LIVE IN BOSTON: REMASTERED, Volumes 1,2 & 3), now comes in a round cardboard box similar to the recent 3CD set of SMALL FACES 'OGDEN'S NUT GONE FLAKE' (same company). I don't own 'BOSTON' but I do have the separate disc and can highly recommend it, grab it while it's still at a reasonable price! The digi-book sets are pricey compared to the bargain 'MEN OF THE WORLD' comp, but if you're a rabid fan of the Peter Green version of FLEETWOOD MAC they are essential purchases, especially due to the thick informative booklets. The reissue of 'THE VAUDEVILLE YEARS' contains the GREAT out-of-print DVD \\"The Original FLEETWOOD MAC: The Early Years\\" but NOT the booklet (see above). I forgot that I had \\"The Madge Sessions\\" when I wrote the initial review but hopefully this additional information will point fans and newbies in the direction of some fine music......<br />ADDENDUM #3: To be completely honest, instead of editing my original review I'm correcting my information here regarding the two \\"Madge\\" instrumentals.

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Star Trek: Into Darkness is one of the best films of the Star Trek series of movies.  To my mind, the only two films that surpass it are Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek: First Contact.  The movie is very solid on story, characterization, and special effect laden action sequences that never overshadow the story or the characters.<br /><br />There are two main things that have made Star Trek an iconic epic over the years.  The first is Gene Roddenberry's vision of a hope for a better tomorrow; that mankind is not only looking to explore strange new worlds, but to explore the unknown possibilities of existence.  Perhaps Q in the final episode of \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" summed up Roddenberry's vision better than anyone when he states: ...\\"the exploration that awaits you is not mapping stars and studying nebulae, but charting the unknown possibilities of existence.\\"<br /><br />The other main component is the relationship between three men that served to demonstrate an unconditional brotherly/comrade love between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.  In many ways, these three characters cover the spectrum of characteristics.  Spock, the ever-logical Vulcan constantly in pursuit of knowledge and logic and always seeming to criticize humans for their irrationality and ever-present emotions.  And yet, we have seen Spock behave almost emotionally when he has saved the lives of his friends countless times.  McCoy, the irascible \\"country\\" doctor who covers the opposite end of the spectrum from Spock as the one who yields more to emotional reactions.  But under McCoy's bickering and arguing is a powerful love that he as for both of his friends.  In the middle of that spectrum, we have Kirk, who is as prone to using logic and common sense as he is to using his gut-feeling and intuition.  And Kirk has an almost obsessive love for his shipmates, his ship, and his friends.<br /><br />The film takes place very early on in Kirk's career.  In fact, he has yet to perform his legendary \\"five year mission.\\"  So, one has to realize that Kirk is still a fledgling captain, regardless of how tactically brilliant he may be.  The same can be said of Spock who is still trying to control the emotions that always seem to be percolating just under the surface.  His relationship with Uhura is still alive and somewhat well.  The couple's relationship will be tested a bit during this film.  And McCoy is still the ever-complaining questioning doctor who seems to have a millions sayings ready to be unleashed at any given moment.  Because the characters are young and new, their relationship has not yet had enough time to gell into the iconic relationship that we know of these three men.  That being said, there is an emotional moment that takes place in the film that, unfortunately, isn't as powerful as it could have been because of the absence of the strength of that relationship.  I had almost hoped that such a moment might be savored for another movie later on when the viewer has a chance to become more emotionally invested with its characters and be able to feel more strongly what the characters are feeling.  On a more optimistic note as a result, a powerful bond and friendship will be solidified.<br /><br />The story takes place when Starfleet utilizes a man who is renowned for his intelligence and tactical abilities.  However, the big prize of Starfleet inevitably turns upon his former masters, and Kirk and company are dispatched to deal with him.  Obviously things are not what they seem, and Kirk is pitted against all odds.  Anyone who is familiar with the story of Star Trek II will remember the famed Kobayashi Maru test (which was also utilized in the last film).  In many ways, this outing serves as Kirk's Kobayashi Maru...a veritable baptism by fire.  You might also notice some other parallel elements from that film as well, which I won't disclose here for those who haven't seen this film yet.<br /><br />The cast of the film are as good as they were in the previous film.  Chris Pine is a fantastic Captain Kirk.  He's arrogant and cocky, and Pine has a real gift for comedic facial expressions and timing.  And we get to see Kirk begin to feel his affinity for his crew and his ship.<br /><br />Zachary Quinto is playing Spock as well as he can.  I don't know if people understand how difficult a role this is.  Leonard Nimoy directed Robin Curtis (Lt. Saavik) in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock.  He stated, \\"to play a Vulcan you must have the look of a thousand years of wisdom in your eyes.\\"  It is not nearly as easy as it sounds.  But again, Spock is very young here in this entry.  In short, however, Leonard Nimoy really did make Spock nearly impossible for anyone else to play with as much complexity and depth that he did.<br /><br />Benedict Cumberbatch is the surprise new character here.  He plays \\"John Harrison\\" with savagery and intelligence that really added some wonderful dimensions to the character.  \\"Harrison\\" is a man who is like a grandmaster chess player; someone who is always a number of moves ahead of everyone else, and it is fun to see if Kirk can find a way to outwit him.  I only wished that he had been given more screen time.  I really wanted to see a bit more exploration of this character.<br /><br />I still think that of all of the characters to really \\"nail\\" the interpretations of their previous counterparts, Karl Urban's Dr. McCoy is still the best.  His speech pattern and mannerisms are all nearly dead-on.  He isn't in this film nearly as much as I would have liked, but every scene he is in is a welcome one.<br /><br />J.J. Abrams has succeeded in breathing life back into a franchise that was all but dead.  This film is fun, exciting, and even thought-provoking when we consider the kind of people that we help to create.  If you enjoyed the last film, it is nearly a certainty that you will enjoy this one as much, if not more so.  And the fun part is, there is still plenty of \\"Star Trek\\" left to be told.a fantastic Captain Kirk.  He's arrogant and cocky, and Pine has a real gift for comedic facial expressions and timing.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app it is so awesome I played on it in until my KINDLE died then I sat by the outlet and played it their.<br />King
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I have no FB friends playing this game,  and hence am unable to enjoy the way the game is designed to enjoy. kind of disappointing.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Brilliant toy, is also a pen! Wonderful addition to my already expanding collection of sonics, and long lasting with the batteries. Definitely a favorite!
B007QEHQY6|5.0|A wonderful collection of wonderful music, excellently performed.  Wrapped in a handsome package .  Great value for money, especially in today's economic climate.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I'm fairly new to &#34;Doctor Who&#34; and Season 4 is unquestionably one of my favorites.  David Tennant really shines as the Doctor (oh how I miss him), new Companion Donna Noble is an amazing character, and let's not forget her grandfather Wilfred Mott.  Also, this is the first time we meet River Song -- I wasn't crazy about her storyline in Seasons 5 and 6, but loved her first appearance.  The stories range from relatively lighthearted (&#34;Partners in Crime&#34;) to wrenchingly poignant (&#34;The Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead,&#34; &#34;Planet of the Ood,&#34; &#34;Turn Left&#34;) and often dark.  The finale brings together all of Ten's other Companions (including Sarah Jane Smith who originally appeared on the pre-reboot Who), and while the whole &#34;The Doctor saves the world from an apocalypse&#34; story is a bit old by now, the character dynamics lift it above cliche.
B0063IH60K|4.0|A great version of basic solitaire. The best time filler for everyone.want to buy the adfree version that will make it a 5 star review
B009GLHF5C|5.0|One of the better CD's to come out in 2013.  Creative and interesting.  I highly recommend this CD. Can't stop listening to it.
0060760273|5.0|It was exactly what I wanted. Thank you very much. Came in the box and everything, it was nice to give as a gift
B00640UICA|2.0|Well,the game was cute,but it just did not sit right. And what gives the developer the right to know about networks,locations and the like? I like my privacy,thank you very much!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I love the way Pam breaks things down so that it is simple to understand.  E2 is well written with step by step instructions on how to begin living a life connected to the Universe.  Not religious, a little spiritual and a lot common sense!
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I'm a dude that listens to mostly rap music and rock.  But Lana Del Rey caught my attention when I found out she is the singer to Summertime Sadness.  Then I listened to other songs on this album and was blown away - not only at how good she is but how I didn't hear of her before.  I don't listen to the radio much anymore so maybe that is it.  Anyways, this is one of those rare albums that comes around every couple of years where every song would be anyone else's best song of their own career.<br /><br />I can only hope that she can break the trend of these super albums and her follow up isn't a letdown.  Anyways, you can't go wrong with this album as it goes next to my Eminem and Jay-Z albums lol.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|They haven't lost the old power !  Usually bands that do come back CD's fall flat on their faces.  Black Sabbath didn't.  They came through with flying colors.  God is Dead was really good in concert.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|A great way to see fb. This app was not the first app I tried. It was difficult to get the information that you can with this app. I feel that Facebook on the kindle was the best way to get, hear, and read.
B00BY7NK96|5.0|Enjoyed her writing style. Great read, very much inspired me to do more in my own path at university. Take action!
0064471837|5.0|This is the best book in YA literature! I've read it over and over and it never ceases to impress me. The characters and world are layered and detailed which brings this book a depth that makes reading it a very engaging. I can't wait to read Clariel the newest book in the series. It is a rare thing for me to want a series to keep going on after the 3rd book. Usually by then I'm done with the characters generally because they haven't grown with the series. This is one series that breaks that mold.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I'm a Trekkie and have watched all Star Trek episodes as well as all the movies and I love this new franchise. These group of new actors cover all the little things that make the characters as believable younger characters. Live it!
B008XG1X18|2.0|Will not load on my kindle fire hd<br />Every time I open it I have to log in again even if I just had it open seconds before. If I click back it starts at the top of what I was looking at...so annoying<br /><br /> When it does load then it freezes and crashes my kindle
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Very fun can be frustrating but also very addictive!  Connect through facebook and play with team mates. Send free gifts! Exciting!
B008KYOCA2|3.0|I have this on my kindle. Too many fields to fill.  Wish I could make the fonts larger. I definitely can not read the calendar from my cell-phone.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed the book and was glad it ended with a good ending.  After everything she went through, she stayed with her man, that I admired her for.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|Read all three in the series in rapid succession.  The first two were difficult to put down.  This one was somewhat of a disappointment.  In the first two, the reader was not initially aware of the mystifying dynamics of the interactions of the main characters.  With this one, the reader can almost anticipate the next event.  The cliffhanger ending was an annoyance, and appeared to be the only option that the author could conjure up.
B006ZS81GG|5.0|Lana Del Ray has a definite retro touch, moody, brooding, yet youthful and playful. The amazing thing is that she has the guts to approach her music her voice, her lyrics, and an orchestral backup. She does not need gimmicks or crazy processing. She is simply Lana.
0823016714|5.0|This book is one of the best values in photo reference books for artists. Many different models and expressions make this an indispensible book for artists and cartoonists.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|One of the best books I've read, wonderful characters, beautiful story, elegantly written. It's given me pause to stop and smell the roses.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought it was good but almost stopped reading it half through but I did finish it and I am glad I did  because it really enjoyed the other 2 books.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|Excellent graphics, plenty of scenes, enough hints so I didn't get stuck. The only thing that would make this game better is more characters, like the rabbit and cheshire cat actually being in the game.
140006922X|5.0|This book portrays the atmosphere and chaos of Palestine during<br />those years leading up to the destruction of Jerusalem.<br />The book establishes the context for the life of Jesus.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|You always need to have calculator handy, when traveling with your kindle it's neat have when needed. I ordered the basic one because it is the only one I need.
B0070UFMOW|4.0|The Fiio E17 was given to me as a gift this past January of 2013. Since then I've gotten some good use out of the E17 and have come to truly enjoy listening to music with it. The E17 is small and lightweight. It has a very good build quality. The casing is mainly metal that has been colored black. The metal has a nice grooved finish to it and is very sturdy. All of the tolerances are very small. The unit doesn't squeak or creak when pressure is applied. The buttons work easily and the navigation system is easy to use. The sound from the E17 is very good. I have used both the auxiliary and USB inputs. I have yet to use the coaxial or optical inputs. My only complain is that no matter how fully or empty the charge of the battery currently is, when plugged in and charging the animation always stays the same. As the charge level increases, all of the bars appear and then disappear. There is no indication of the current charge level while charging.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I think it was a book that showed women what other women go through and I was very surprised myself, I was very surprised.
B000JJCQ68|5.0|Great story of the resilience of the Jewish people and of one man's attempt to save those who couldn't save themselves.  The only thing I didn't like was the nudity, which was not necessary.  This would have been a great family movie to teach moral lessons, but have to think twice about showing children.  Otherwise, well done!
B0002O06N0|5.0|I love the Black Keys. Especially there old stuff.  Rubber Factory, Thick Freakness, and Magic Potion are on my favorite of all time CD lists.  This CD rocks hard and has a great blues soul to the music. These CD's are raw pure awesomeness.  I bet Jack White likes em, but he's never gonna admit it.
B0095P31L6|5.0|It was a real cute movie, both me and my grandson enjoyed the movie. It was good tha there was a moral to the movie, you don't see many now that try to seperate the good from the bad.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The series just gets better and better.  You really begin to know the Family, Staff and all the drama that goes with it.  Extremely enjoyable!
B001HN69B8|4.0|This is an off the wall different movie. I really enjoyed it with the twists & turns & loved the ending. It had good acting & humor. This is one I do watch over.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Great unexpected end and well written crime novel. Told from the father`s perspective as a prosecuted, this gave it a very different viewpoint.
B000VSAEYI|4.0|After reading some of e reviews, I was a little hesitant getting this as we were wanting it for my daughter's first birthday party. I intended to blow it up a couple of days before to make sure there were no holes, but ran out of time. So we just had to take a chance. It took 3 of us about 10 minutes to blow it up manually. (There are several blow up areas and we each focused on one.) It held up through a couple of hours of playing from two one year olds, a two year old, and a three year old.<br /><br />Before the kiddos were finished playing, though, the stopper that holds in the air for the entire perimeter part just blew open. The walls of the pool just collapsed and a majority of the water emptied out of the pool. The kids weren't jumping or sitting on the sides or anything like that so I'm not sure what happened. Maybe we just didn't push it in tight enough? Though it seems it would have come out a lot sooner if that were the case. Anyway, I would suggest taking some duct tape and covering the stoppers before letting the kids play, just in case.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Wow after reading second book you are left with no words. Truthfully, even if you are left with no words...you crave for wanting to know more. If truly there could be more than being Fifty Shades of Grey.
B008602KQI|4.0|entertaining good plot reasonable acting , not brilliant or profound but still fun.<br />I don't have more to say to fill up the 19 words that you require in a review
B0058O84G0|5.0|From the poorest coal mining family to the rich and influential houses of London society, that's where Ken Follett's Fall of Giants takes you and you find kindness and cruelty in both places. This book is the kind of read that pulls you in and makes you forget time, I greedily gobbled up the pages wanting to find out what happened next.  Ken Follett's characters are well rounded and believable and, just as I did, I'm sure you will have your favourites, the people you want to see come out on top. Don't be intimidated by the length of this book, it moves along at a cracking pace and I was disappointed when I got to the end, I wanted more... you will too.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Amazing game if u like escape games. I mean yeah other escape games are old and boring . But this 1 is the best 1I have played highly recommended . 4 escape gamers
B0092SQ5EG|4.0|I was expecting something with a lot of PC crud.  Was surprised at how well her story was told and the live performances really good.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was a thrilling ride to read it...it was suspenseful, heartwarming, deliberating, and endless happy ending wanting for more. Which I hope there is more to a Fifty Shades Freed! :)
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Love the show!!!  It's wonderful.  Doesn't get any better.  Give us the rest of the seasons on Prime, Amazon!!! (hint)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for the next season to begin! Love this series. When will season 4 be available? Sad from the ending of Season 3.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I think it is good because  they really help u with all the words that u need help finding what they mean . They also do need to add like math terms in this it would really help others wise this is so help full to me and others.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|See Seasons 1&2 & You'll want to buy the rest too. No bothersome commercials to sit or scan through! Excellent!
B005HSL626|5.0|One of the hubby's favorite games. Very addicting and easy to use. Perfect for solving boredem at work and at home.
1885167776|5.0|If you are looking for advice on being more productive and achieving extraordinary results in your life, you need to read \\"The One Thing: The Surprisingly Simple Truth Behind Extraordinary Results\\" by Gary Keller with Jay Papasan. This is an excellent guide to minimizing your distractions and focusing on what really matters in all areas of your life: work, personal, family, and spiritual.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this book, and the simple ideas provided a jolt of motivation and some guidance on being more productive than I already am. The book was easy to read with motivating quotes, relevant illustrations, and a straight forward style that just made sense. I found myself nodding along thinking, \\"I do that, I need to do that better, hmm, hadn't thought about that, but I'm sure going to do it now.\\"<br /><br />The book is divided into three main parts. The first, The Lies, contains chapters on topics such as everything matters equally, multitasking, a disciplined life, willpower is always on will-call, a balanced life, and big is bad. The authors do a great job of explaining and convincing why these \\"lies\\" we hear and tell ourselves and not helping us be more productive, but actually reducing our productivity on what really matters. (I'm really glad more people are realizing that multitasking is NOT the way to be more productive with things that count. Sure, you can listen to educational recordings while doing the dishes or exercising, but when you need to be focused on your job, or those projects that need attention to be done well, you have to do one thing at a time.)<br /><br />Part two, The Truth, focuses on three main concepts, the focusing question, the success habit, and the path to great answers. This is the meat of focusing on your One Thing.  This is how you will accomplish more. I'm working on reminding myself of the focusing question and asking myself this question more regularly. It's simple, but it can be powerful.<br /><br />The final, and third part, contains chapters on living with purpose, living by priority, living for productivity, three commitments, and the four thieves. These principles are what support your One Thing and help you achieve those One Thing goals.<br /><br />Again, I really enjoyed this book, and I plan on using it as a reference as I implement more of the author's ideas into my lifestyle. The simple formula presented here is simple, but not easy. There are habits to be broken and others to be created. But if you really want more; If you really want to be productive; and if you really want extraordinary results; The One Thing is a guide book that will help you reach those goals and more.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of [[ASIN:1937872068 Lost Conscience: A Ben Baker Sniper Novel]] and others.ird part, contains chapters on living with purpose, living by priority, living for productivity, three commitments, and the four thieves.

B001RTSPVY|5.0|It took my wife & I a number of years to become fans of Breaking  Bad. Once we ordered the 1st & 2nd seasons, we had to have the rest. Naturally watching on AMC now but I enjoyed better on the DVDs. No commercials and volume screaming when my wife scans through the commercials.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|My husband mentioned that The Shield had high ratings on various websites, so I agreed we should try it out.  I didn't want to like it because most Cop shows I find to be too &#34;glossy&#34; - Perfect looking actors, that sort of thing.  That is not the case with The Shield.<br /><br />I find the characters to be very believable.  They look like real people and are all flawed in some way (well, except for Det. Claudette Wyms - a strong female character perfectly played by CCH Pounder).  Michael Chiklis does an excellent job portraying Det. Vic Mackey - a very complex character.  He is as flawed as a Cop - a human - can be yet, he does have a caring side that causes me to not be able to fully dislike him.<br /><br />The Shield is one of the more violent TV shows I have seen.  There are times when I have to look away as it it too much.  However, none of those scenes feels like it was created just for the sake of portraying extreme violence.  The incidents, unfortunately, are taken from real-life, particularly, the scenes involving drug dealers.<br /><br />Overall, if you like Cop shows, you can't go wrong with The Shield.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show... Love the dynamic between mike and Harvey, Donna also demands so much attention with her wonderful performances, can't wait to see more!
0553801473|4.0|I waited for the promised trade paperback edition but after postponement upon postponement, I went for the hard cover edition.<br /><br />Given the long lapses between books, I find that I must begin the series anew with each new release.  That usually works to refresh the plots and allows me to sink into the world of Fire & Ice, picking up the threads as they appear ( or don't).<br /><br />Given the concept that this volume contains all the rest of the saga that was left out of \\"A Feast for Crows\\", it is hampered by the format.  With the first three volumes, you got the feeling that you were staying current with all of the plots.  Given the way that the story has expanded, this could not happen with the \\"MegaSaga\\" that would have resulted in trying to combine \\"A Feast for Crows\\" and \\"A Dance with Dragons\\".  I would have preferred Mr. Martin to shorten the timeline in order to maintain the continuity.  The plotline is just too complex and even though I had re-read the previous 4 volumes directly before tackling this one, it was a struggle.  Perhaps the \\"Winds of Winter\\" will contract a bit as various threads are resolved.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|See Seasons 1, 2 & 3....You'll want to buy the rest too. No bothersome commercials to sit or scan through! Excellent!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have been trying to set up my Verizon email for ever.. Finally I installed this app and it was working so fast I didn't even have to think about it. Thank you.
B009H1S56O|5.0|I enjoy the music and it has a both Born to Die as well as Paradise disks.  Also, the 5th disc is a 45 record which is cool to me.
B009OYTIXS|2.0|This show started out fine enough. in all seriousness though, the further you get into the season the more i found myself in shock at the outright fake situations and predictability of it all. the acting is alright, but the writing is atrocious.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|A bit slow to get going. Read it because I low the musical. Now I have the rest of the story and enjoy the musical that much more.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have a handyman business one time my battery went dead in my contractor calc. But I had this with me I did what I needed it to and I got the bid thanks gregg
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It's the kind of book you start missing before you finish reading. I really recommend it! One of the best contemporary books I've read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is my new favorite app! There are so many personal and business idea applications for this. Particularly for those of us that have an inner yet untalented artist at heart, the ideas are great to share.<br /><br />This is the best app.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a beautifully written piece of literature that will lift your heart while at the same time tear at your soul.  Well done, Mr. Green.
B00EEXST2K|3.0|Just a average movie and this scenario has been played out in other movies many times, She was a victim more or less of a pimp who used her to support his drug use and to feed himself:(
B006LSZECO|4.0|really different and unique.  not your average thriller at all.  This had me wondering all the way to the very end.
B001MSMULG|5.0|I purchased this 2 days ago and started reading after the evening news. Just finished it tonight before dinner. The story was both interesting and believable. The characters are all human, sometimes to a fault.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The BEST game ever it's very addictive I can't put it down I really recommend it to get the game
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|If this movie is in the genre that you enjoy, you'll enjoy this one. Good action flick with a new twist on an old tale.
B008AIGWVA|3.0|limited actions and little playing, lots of ads for buying the toys<br />the cat is also OK but ads are there too.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Great game. Me and my kids play every night before bed. It's great that u don't have to use your own money to be able to play.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book.  Great guy.  We need more like him in America.  I love this book, I love this book, I<br /><br />......Just need to get 20 words in so Amazon will let me submit a review.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Cruise at his best. Loved the dialogue between Cruise and Duval. Enjoyed this one so much, we went out and bought a copy.
B000OVLIQU|5.0|Great read!!! A personal journal from the man who was there for virtually every Beatle recording from the beginning, as well as being the main engineer on every EMI recording from Revolver through Abbey Road. He exlains in detail just how innovative and explorative The Beatles were in the way they approached the recording process while breaking just about every rule EMI had for doing so. Particularly fascinating were the chapters devoted to Sgt. Pepper's, of course. In short, Mr Emerick made some of the most iconic recordings of the 20th century and changed the way musc was recorded forever.<br /><br />This book offers a point of view I have not read before focusing on the band's studio time. His personal and professional relationship with George Martin and observations of the band are  both detailed and entertaining. He also bashes some of the long time stigmas associated with the \\"power-struggles\\" within the band.<br /><br />I have read quite a few books regarding The Beatles, however I found this to be one of the best. Being a musician and understanding the recording process, he offers insights to me which were both relevant and again, fascinating in how they executed their vision. After their first few releases, tours, the ensuing mania and record sales figures, they had estalished carte blanche at EMI. Until then, no artist, much less a rock and roll band, dared even try to change the way studios worked in England. Espedially stuffy old EMI, a classical music/comedy label! I listen to the recordings he speaks of and hear them now in a new way. Things like alarm clocks, bongos, hand claps, solos and orchestrations that I always heard before are now so much more audible as well as meaningful. Now I know how and why they are there as well as if they were intended or not!<br /><br />John once replied when asked how he felt about The Beatles after they broke up, \\"Well, we changed the world didn't we?\\" This book gives a warm, loving and detailed journal of just how they did it through their recordings. Remember that after 1966, The Beatles never toured again so records were thier only medium in those wonderful \\"pre-MTV\\" days. That they did most of it with a 4 track board is absolutely astounding!  Even with the advent of 128 track boards and digital wizardry, no other artist since has accomplished anything close.<br /><br />Mr Emerick offers a perspective that is technically detailed without being superfluous and condescending. He loved his job and it clearly shows in this warm telling. Mr Emerick didn't write the music. He didn't play the music, he didn't really produce the music, he recorded it. The way this music was recorded and how it still stands up today, is without question, a major contribution to the overall quality and beauty of The Beatles' catalog. To me, he is just as much an artist in his kraft as any of The Beatles and Sir George Martin were in thiers. He deserves so much more credit that he has recieved.<br /><br />Great book indeed!
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I mean it was good at first but then it would take forever to load and download and when you download it cost money
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is the best series I have ever read.  I highly recommend this series to anyone interested in the fantasy genre.

B0084I9QIW|5.0|Michael Jackson has always demanded the best from himself and commanded the best from his supporting cast.  He will not short-change you in this performance.  Yes, I have seen better performances of him especially when he is introducing new songs or new dancing moves.  He tirelessly performs his popular songs and dance moves in continuous sucession as if he is still a young man.  I am thoroughly convinced that it will be centuries before another song and dance artist of his amazing caliber be displayed to the world.  You will be taken on another fantasy ride so hold your breath and enjoy!
B0060CV498|5.0|This was a gift for my granddaught who is disable and she loves it.  The quality is just as good as buying from the store.  I will definitely buy more videos.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|From start to finish this is one beautiful piece of work. There are no dead spots or let downs in this collection...just one great musical piece after another. TTB is the best rock blues band on the road right now and if you haven't bought their stuff yet, get to it. You won't regret it and make sure to see them live in concert; you'll be blown away by the tremendous talent by everyone on stage. Thank you TTB for sharing your talents with us!
B009LQKHIO|5.0|If you like romance novels, you'll like this one. It is a quick fun read, you should enjoy. Try it.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Great movie for kids and adults.  Price was so much better than paying direct tv every time my niece wanted to watch it
B005LAIISA|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the &#34;Ice Age&#34; films. Totally dipped in &#34;very funny stuff&#34; and good clean, family fun. I especially love the squirrel and his acorn at the beginning of each Ice Age animation. Waiting for the next adventure.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen! The characters are well defined and could be anyone's neighbors.
0307719774|5.0|This journal is what I was looking for! It has interesting questions for each day that make you think about yourself and who you want to be. In addition, it has places for the next five years on each question so you can see how you change over the years.
B009VYAVTG|5.0|I can't say enough positive about this series.  I'm so taken with these young actors and how they've grown through this five years.  I will enjoy having this in my collection for years to come.  Highly recommended for those who love the Arthur legend!
B005LAIIJY|5.0|A gritty, hard hitting film that benchmarks  Mr. Tarrentino's style. The cinematography was outstanding as well as the casting of the main characters.
B007AL48UK|4.0|I enjoy the game, the tiles give a fun new twist on mahjong.<br />I would recommemd it to anyone who enjoys the game.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|I'm about 50 pages from finishing this book and it's only just begun to get interesting. The vignettes Kerman tries to create aren't smooth. I read a paragraph giving some interesting information about one inmate, then the next paragraph abandons to talk about something completely different. Then as soon as that character's all but forgotten she she pops back in and I have no idea who she is. It's a great insight, don't get me wrong. It's just clunkier to read that I'd anticipated.
B00B5A9FOG|5.0|I can't say enough positive about this series.  I'm so taken with these young actors and how they've grown through this five years.  I will enjoy having this in my collection for years to come.  Highly recommended for those who love the Arthur legend!
B008JFUO36|5.0|Again, another film succeeding in the computer generated imagery arena. Great action and non-stop expectations of what's happening next. Even though the ending was a bit soft, I still liked it. Guess I have a soft spot for a happy ending even in the world of clones.
B00006HBUA|5.0|I was just looking for it on DVD and i finally got it! YAY! Thank you so so so much!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Crisp, snappy writing and superb delivery. This is as modern and entertaining as Sherlock can get! Definitely a must watch.
B001LF347E|5.0|I can't say enough positive about this series.  I'm so taken with these young actors and how they've grown through this five years.  I will enjoy having this in my collection for years to come.  Highly recommended for those who love the Arthur legend!
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|Everything I have been told about nutrition throughout the years  vs  what I have read here so far.<br />I have lost over 15 lbs in less than 2 months by following what he says, and I haven't even had the time to finish the book yet!<br />Now it all makes sense to me.
B0099RFVXQ|1.0|After about 15 minutes I still hadn't a clue what was happening so I turned it off.  I'll admit I'm completely unfamiliar with Marvel Comics.  Wasn't worth figuring it out.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|What a great story! So nice to hear a feel good tale. Bob is a true friend. We all need something to love and care for.

B001IF252M|5.0|It does exactly what it says it will do. Takes a thunderbolt port and gives you VGA. Owned it for a week and it hasn't broken yet.
B004J4XGN6|4.0|The lean startup is a good book and it introduces a new way of thinking about a product and how to measure it's sucess! The build measure learn loop is very intresting but the book is a little bit repetitive, it could have ~100 less pages :)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I found this book to be nothing but emotional , it was very realistic for me since I'm entering my Freshman year of highschool this coming Monday. I can understand what Charlie goes through....and I hope he does get better :)
B0064MGU98|5.0|I enjoyed it. Each episode itself is short and complete. Was very entertaining, and kept you interested on all the characters
B009CPGZFS|5.0|I love this series.  Simon Baker is flawless.  The writing is stellar.  I would highly recommend becoming a fan of the Mentalist series.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I have checked out and played a large percent of the games by Gameloft. Even though there are a few games I enjoy more this is definitely the highest functioning. The acorns &quot;  bonus currency &quot;  and hearts earned through connecting with friends are readily available and awarded often in addition to being available to purchase with real money. Connecting friends is easier than any other game I've played. Have reached friends through both gameloft and facebook and easily added most by simply visiting random neighbors and clicking invite. Only problem I ever had was purchasing a bonus pack but that was yesterday and pretty sure it was a payment method issue and have no reason to believe it won't be addressed and fixed soon. Basically great game lots of fun things to do. Only game I play that doesn't have a mission that wasn't easily completed, while most of my others have ones I can't complete due to issues like adding friends or some other glitch.
B004AFFZNI|5.0|This is an awesome way to be able to keep your GoPro hardwired with power when you are worried that battery life will be an issue.  I wish I would have known about this before I drilled holes into the original case for this exact purpose.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Completely different from the first edition. Director cut out of scenes but replaced them with ones that makes a whole lot of sense. A lot of scenes were replaced to the point that it feels like watching a completely different movie. I played crisis core, FF7, and this 2nd edition really brings the series to a nice closing.  I'm glad they decided to recreate a movie to address to viewers who may come from playing the games and also viewers who may be new to the final fantasy series.
B008LXZFH6|5.0|Hilarious characters and classic one liners. Catch this one before the sequel comes out soon! Applegate is awesome and this is better than Talladega Nights.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This fourth installment of this fabulous epic \\"OUTLANDER\\" adventure has always thrilled me.  All the books hold so much adventure and detailed historical information...but THIS installment is absolutely, mind boggling thrilling. At least it is for me.  From Hispaniola (Haiti) to the New World...this installment takes place in the Colonies of America, 1767.<br /><br />Jamie has always been a Warrior and a soldier most of his life with a mind of an educated gentleman and a soul of a barbarian.  Now he's in his 40's...good sense has tempered his fighting passion.  He's set on carving out a new life for Claire.  Claire is content to go where Jamie leads.  Her happiness IS Jamie and nothing more.  Yet she knows the Revolution will occur less than 10 years in their future.  Facing another war is a frightening thought.<br /><br />Through all of Claire's fears of losing Jamie...he vows to her \\"when my body shall cease, my soul will still be yours.  Claire, I swear by my hope of heaven, I will not be parted from you\\".....(I'm recalling his specter in book #1).<br /><br />To quickly recap: In the first book, Claire Randall had disappeared from 1945, to the eighteenth century Scotland; the year of 1743. She vanished when she went through the standing stones of Craigh na Dun and her adventure began. She fell in love with and married Jamie Fraser, and lived with him for nearly three years, before being forced to return through the standing stones to 1948, Scotland, which is the end of the second book, Dragonfly in Amber.  The third book \\"Voyager\\", deals with Jamie and Claire searching for kidnapped Ian, Jamies'  sisters' youngest son and his nephew.  (I just LOVE Ian!!).  And in this fourth installment \\"Drums of Autumn\\", Jamie finally meet's his 20th century daughter, Brianna.  And I bawled buckets.......BUCKETS!!!<br /><br />This fourth book of the OUTLANDER saga could actually stand on its own....but WHY would you not want to read this fabulous epic from it's beginning?!? IMHO, it's best to start at the beginning with Outlander - - if for nothing else than to fully appreciate and understand the devoted, passionate relationship between Jamie and Claire....and to thoroughly KNOW them. Then proceed to Dragonfly in Amber (Outlander, Book 2) to understand how their devotion for each other grows.  Move on to \\"Voyager\\" (book #3) for a thrilling journey to the West Indies....and then to \\"Drums of Autumn\\" to find out how they begin a new life.<br /><br />Ms. Gabaldon ALWAYS discloses and informs the reader of facts, events and experiences of Jamie and Claire, then walks away from those events and experiences. And then, somewhere in later episodes, she brings that moment back ....somewhere in the series. And \\"Drums of Autumn\\" follows this line of dropping information upon the reader, only to make it reappear later in the book. It's like little informative puzzle pieces that she plops down in our laps and walks away, closing the chapter. And leaves the reader thinking, \\"WOW!\\" ....and then somewhere later in the same book, (or subsequent books), that information or event is brought back to our mind/attention. And the reader is soundly blown away!<br /><br />As I've previously stated (in my first three reviews), this is the third time I've read this Epic 7 book Outlander Saga through the many years but it's the first time I've taken time to give a review. Like all the other 5★ rave reviews, I can never put this story down once I begin...errands are curtailed, housework goes to pot and laundry piles up. It holds me completely captive with crippling intensity with all of its emotional structure and profound dimension. The story is so captivating and consuming that I find that I begin to slow my reading down as I see the end looming in sight, hating to let Jamie and Claire go. It never fails. BECAUSE THESE CHARACTERS ARE REAL.. DANG IT!  Reading Drums of Autumn for the third time, I've noticed things that I didn't catch the first two times of readingit.<br /><br />When I read this Saga, I'm transported to Scotland, or France, or the Colonies of America!  I mean......I'M THERE! I see the deplorable living conditions...smell the stink of the slops thrown out the windows. I'm walking the cobblestones and seeing the people...seeing all the immigrants in their different cultural garb. The descriptive detail and narration are so strong, exact and perfect that one cannot help be emotionally invested in little time. You're transported into another world and time...and you're reluctant to return. Diana Gabaldon is...simply put... brilliant! The absolute best! Yes, the stories are long but each character is carefully considered and the scenic details imperative to the emotion of the era...and the events that are chosen to be included are necessary to have the story told well.<br /><br />If you will allow the time, and give the effort to patiently absorb the detailed narration, you will be blessed and rewarded with the most emotional, captivating Saga ever to hold in your hands..<br /><br />When I read this Saga, I'm transported to Scotland, or France, or the Colonies of America!

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have been hooked on the series since show 1 , season 1. Superbly written, wonderfully acted and the costumes and the props are so authentic. I watched the first three episodes over three weeks and then I saw episode 4. Well, I had to watch the last three episodes the rest of that day, and wow! You have got to see it!!!
B002ZG98C8|5.0|Great movie. I was happy with this movie and would watch it again, again, agian again, again, again and again.
140006922X|5.0|First of all, I am a Catholic who goes to Mass regularly.  So when I tell you this book is a gem, I am telling you it is an important book to read to get a feel for the REAL atmosphere of the times in which Jesus lived.  I have seen an interview in which an interviewer who obviously hadn't read the book attacked the author.  She looked like a fool.  She should have read the book.
B0052OSTOS|5.0|After coming home from a long night at work I'll usually put my phone on silent, turn off my tv and listen to either the 5 minute or 13 minute meditation session depending on if I'm going to bed or not. Overall, it's an excellent product and am grateful to have it so I can unwind and relax before work drives me insane.
B007HVBW2A|5.0|Great movie still holds up to one of the best horror movies ever. No monsters, no  masks, and stupid crap just good vs evil
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was a page turner that I couldn't put down. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. Loved it
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|This is a terrific book with many life lessons, a multitude of memorable quotes, a plethora of interesting characters, and one man's search for significance and freedom! The beauty is in the journey of the main character, as he attempts to establish meaningful relationships and work through many personal trials and events. I highly recommend this book and plan to re-read all of my highlighted notes, which is quite rare for this ravenous reader!!!
0345803485|5.0|it was in great condition and i loved the book. i would reccomend buying it to anyone my fav book
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Bob was just a stray cat who became friends,.or should I say family with the writer and their story is very, very interesting! With their ups and downs, I had a hard time putting it down!<br />I would recommend this to anyone with a love of true stories and especially ones with animals involved! Very touching!
B00BP29SAA|5.0|This game helped keep my 3-year-old daughter entertained during a long wait in a waiting room. It is cute enough.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I'm way behind the curve on this, but this is the first time I've been able to play this and I love it.  You can actually learn from this!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|The discussion of the historical Temple practices and the relationship of the Temple and the High Priest with Roman authorities was illuminating.
B00AHQNHSY|4.0|I like this one<br />I also like &#34;cinex&#34; player it plays ALL formats but has some issues with ac3 sound, still a great player
B0053O89WY|5.0|What else can I say. We love it. We thought it was our duty to watch each DVD in a short time to verify the DVDs were in good condition. We are happy to say they worked!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I thought it was a good movie not much for action but more of<br />a mind trip and the story was good.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I'm a sucker for great CGI and Oblivion had them. Some of the film was predictable but towards the end there were surprises that posed questions that could lead to another movie. As always Tom Cruise is a good action hero and Morgan Freeman provided the appropriate amount of gravitas.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book is wonderful!  The character development is smooth and the story is super original. If there was only one bad thing to say about it, it would be how quickly the book moves. Normally I wish novels would develop quickly, but this one is almost too quick. There is SO much going on that happens in a flash.<br /><br />Other than that, love it and planning to read the next!<br /><br />I would recommend to my girlfriends, or anyone ages 15+
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo Blitz is a great game. After I get home for work working all night long. I just lay in my bed and play til I get sleepy.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is both fascinating and frustrating at the same time.  I hate that it takes so long for the primary actions that move quests forward (breeding and evolving the dragons).  I am a high enough level that it can take more than a day to breed and hatch a single egg, and it is difficult to breed the rare dragons, even with the right combination of parents.  Growing food is slow and expensive.  Every aspect of the game is tedious in the amount of time it takes if you don't speed it up with gold; and gold is a premium item that costs real money to get in any adequate quantities.  But I can't stop playing.  I have to keep striving for the elusive dragons in my quest log.  I am churning through breeding, hatching and evolving dragons as fast as I can, to see if I can get new ones I haven't hatched yet.  Completely obsessed.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I am hooked on Game of Thrones!  I will be so sad when I finish reading book 5. Hopefully there will be a sequel!
B00846REIS|5.0|I'm not one who reads often. This book had my full attention @ all times. I had a hard time setting it down. Would recommend to any women!
B003PIUBZS|5.0|If you are a fan of this series then this is a MUST buy as I'm able to enjoy all the exciting moments from the beginning.  Although, I'm a HUGE fan of Blood and Sand as well.  Andy Whitfield will always be Spartacus to me!!!
B0050AV5MW|2.0|In a word this book is uninspiring - consequently there is not sufficient reason to get to know and remember the multiplicity and interplay of the characters. However at times it surprises one and rather fascinating facts of times gone very much by are revealed. However it is too uninteresting to recommend.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|CANNOT WAIT UNTIL IT STARTS AGAIN, WE HAVE WATCHED SEASON ONE ,TWO AND THREE TWICE WAITING FOR SEASON 4 TO BEGIN!  AWESOME STORY LINE!
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|great movie has all the things you want in a great movie. I would tell people that this is a great movie
B007W8S2MG|5.0|having played a little bit into the original persona 4 and then now playing this you notice a whole new world of content. there is extra music stuff and what seems to be a lecture into Jungian psychology. really cool stuff
B000I8HIR2|5.0|Great story, I truly enjoyed the plot. I also enjoy the sequel and what they do with the daughter character. I hope they make more of this franchise.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I bought this headset to use when gaming. I dont need all the cool features and options. I just needed a basic headset that was wireless, that I could hear others, and most importantly others could hear me. I have used 3 USB headsets of various price ranges and they all were garbage. Decided to pay the extra money and get this one even though I didnt need the fancy features.<br /><br />I love it. I can walk away from the computer when we \\"take 5\\" and still hear what is going on (yes, it breaks up after 40 - 50' but instantly reconnects when I get in range). Not having a cord is awesome.<br /><br />Two downsides that dont detract from the five stars. First, these puppies make my head sweat. It has been a long time since I used \\"full ear\\" headphones (like back in the 70's) but I dont recall them being this hot. After 3 hours of gaming with this headset on my ears are cooking and so is the rest of my head. I dont know if it is physical heat from using them (like the headset is heating up) or just my own body heat causing things to cook but they are not very comfortable to wear for long periods due to this. Most times I end up moving the right ear piece off my ear and just using the left when I cant take the heat any more.<br /><br />Second is that I could have sworn it was advertised that if the battery dies you can simply plug in the USB cable and keep gaming. I have been unable to make this work. When the battery dies, the headset is useless. Maybe I am missing something but I should just be able to plug it in using the USB cable, turn it on and keep going. But the system doesnt recognize it unless the USB dongle is in place - and my laptop only had three USB connections so this wont work for me. One USB is for the cordless mouse dongle, the second is for the lap desk fan connection (very necessary when gaming on a laptop since the video card heats up) and then the last USB is either dongle or direct wire connection. So if using it with the cord still requires the dongle then it may not work for everyone.<br /><br />But - that being said - the battery lasts 4 - 5 hours and I dont typically game using the headset for more than a few hours.<br /><br />All in all, highly recommend this headset even if you dont need the fancy features. You wont be disappointed.<br /><br />EDIT - one thing I forgot to mention that is sort of a problem but doesnt detract from the headset. It requires a dongle that is the size of thumb drive. There is no \\"holder\\" for the dongle in the headset. For instance - my wireless mouse has a place to put the dongle when it isnt in use to keep them together - or, more importantly - to make it \\"portable\\". I use the headset on three different computers and keeping track of the dongle is a pain especially if I leave it on my end table when using my laptop and the dog knocks it to the ground. I am thinking of putting velcro on it and on the top of the headset piece so I can stick it to the headset when not in use. So if you are like me and constantly misplace small objects, the dongle is a pain to keep track of.
B005IF7TCE|1.0|I figured this would be really cool. I was wrong. I received a lot of feed back about how horrible the mic quality was. I used it for about a month before giving up on it and going back to the original headset.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Really a good read, first, it could very well be real and I could feel the anguish of Jacob's parents during the narration of the story which by the way is very well written and hard to put down each night till you finished it.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Easy, fast play.  I play daily, especially when I only have a few minutes.  It's a quick fix for a break.
0060555661|5.0|Written to the practitioner and weekend investor alike- all can benefit from Graham's timeless wisdom. Don't be without this value investor's Bible.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Enjoy this series quite a bit. Acting is on par and the stories are similar to corporate law firms, yet a bit (quite a bit) more dramatic on the show.
0882847953|5.0|This is an awesome lesson book.  If you're looking to work on becoming more fluid and accurate behind the kit, then this book is a must!  It's filled with hours upon hours of exercises, especially if you take your time and really work on mastering each and every exercise as you go along.<br /><br />Don't hesitate to buy this if you're interested in it!
B007AL48UK|5.0|Love the whimsical tiles.  It just makes playing so much more fun.  Play every chance I can catch a few minutes.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I can't wait for the nest episode.<br />The twists and turns are great, tough guys show a soft side. The cases carry into the nest episode keeping you interested.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|THE CHARACTERS AND ACTORS ARE ALL THE SAME GREAT PEOPLE WE HAVE SEEN THROUGH OUT THE SERIES.  I WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED IN THE END SHOW, AS I AM SURE OTHERS WERE.
B0015HOFZI|1.0|the machine does not work.<br />I had trepidation when I was opening the box. The packing material used was garbage bags, used diapers, and an old pillow. The box was way oversized for the item but it was full of garbage. The only redeeming item were a few vintage 45's. Even if it worked there were no instructions included but I assume you need a separate sound system to hear the records.<br />If I knew what I had to do I would return the item. The packing I already threw out.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|PI really enjoy this game except the htgs are getting ridicoulous to get.  I understand a little harder but really!!  It takes months to get them.  This part is extremely frustrating!!!  Last thing would be to give a few more seconds after u call the last number so people can hit the darn bingo button.  We all loose so many items because of these last few seconds.  More shadows of htgs would be really really nice too.  I know these have been discussed in many chatrooms.  Please help!!!!!  One more thing - when u go to fb to add a friend it boots u out of ur current room and then u have to search for the room u were just in.  Takes a lot of time and could cost a trade.<br />End
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Oh, what a marvelous, warm-hearted film this is, rich with engaging story, powerfully written, with endearing characters perfectly cast. I'm no opera fan, certainly, but this film grabbed and held me through two viewings. Unlike most movies today, this one's a keeper. Maggie Smith is, as always, magnificent ... but so are the others. An added bonus: many of the cast are indeed retired performers, though you don't know that until the credits roll at the movie's end.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Overall the movie was very entertaining and would watch again when it comes out on cable TV!  All the BEST!
B0085HWZ9Y|4.0|Great &#34;live &#34; show...good song selection and a terrific band behind Robert.  I would recommend this DVD to any Robert Plant fan.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|If you don't get on the game and scratch the cards, you can't restore the amount of plays you can get. Usually games like this are time-based with restoring the amount of plays. This game fails at that.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Though I cannot approve of all of the content (like glimpses of nudity), I nevertheless totally enjoyed it. They did a good job retelling the old story in modern times.
B001RUXW48|5.0|Is very good movie, so complete, i'm so happy with the choice... no complaint at all... es one Of my favorites...
B00322PK2G|5.0|This item is a good fit for a woman's wrist. Has luminescent dials on both hands for night viewing, would recommend
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Many flaws with this app. When viewing a video you can't look at the comments or video info. The video pauses when you try to. When searching for videos, the videos on the front page remain on the screen, behind the videos you are searching for. This app is terrible; don't get it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The BEST British show of the past 20 years. I must recommend it though there is a great deal of pathos and sorrow in the story.
B00E1LAS42|5.0|I loved the movie, the sound, picture quality, idea and actors - all have been perfect! I highly recommend to watch this movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show, wonderful actors and actresses. I feel like your in the time and story line is gripping. I can't wait until the next season.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|Great paced book! Just fast enough to keep my attention but not so fast that I got lost in it.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|One of the better small-town 19th century dramas which BBC has produced. It is akin to Downton Abbey though looking at a whole village rather than one family.
B007SOQBCM|4.0|I love this app, it works with a lot if livestreams and there are only a few bad things. There's no chat, which mean you are unable to communicate, you can just watch. Also, you cannot see who you followed to see if they are livestreaming, it says not available on this device. Other than that, it's amazing!
B0016KJKIG|3.0|Overall I like the sheath but I foresee problems with the hook & loop fasteners not holding when I have the full tool kit and extra saw and file in the pouch. It just seems to be weak. I've developed a modification the should work to keep it closed so it should be OK.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A gentle haunting adult fairy tale told from a child's point of view. Beautifully written and evocative despite its many fantasy elements. I was truly convinced that the story was possible, and couldn't read fast enough to find out what would happen. This is a book I highly recommend.
B002GNDXY4|5.0|One of the best TV shows which has come out in the last twenty years. I must recommend it to others.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's so fun  it's just like temple run but a little bit different very fun and even better its free :D I would recommend it to everyone
B00CXQL828|2.0|these guys are just another generic cookie cutter superband. if you want to hear a good 70's style blues-rock band, try black country communion. they are the best superband i've heard since temple of the dog!
B00AYR2FQ6|4.0|This CD is very hard to characterize, but after you've listened to it a few times, if you're like me and several of my friends, you'll find the selections haunting.
0375424474|5.0|This book is easy to read, not as dry and it does not have the &#34;textbook&#34; feel as many others are on the subject of evolution. I feel that the explanations are very clear and aide in the understanding of not only evolution but also geology, scientific methods, and the experience of finding evidence for the history of life on earth. Excellent book!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It's all right you need to make more things on it instead of it being the same obstacle every time and more characters
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Great show. Watched too many seasons a bit too fast and didn't get my work done.<br />Good drama. A real 'shoot em up' movie
1452113432|5.0|If you can't go to Paris get this little cookbook and you will feel like you're right there with the author and her lovely little stories and the photographs are beautiful !price is great arrived in perfect condition thank you so much
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I liked the movie a lot would watch it again any time great action movie for teens and up too.
B00DU16OJM|5.0|That we already knew, of course, but this album shows his experience in crafting thoughtful songs.  Most have noted the beauty of the title track, but my favorite right now is still &#34;Hell Bent on a Heartache.&#34;  Easily one of my favorite albums of the year and that puts this album in some great company.
B000IKNZMM|5.0|We watched the making of the Hindenburg, which was extremely interesting.  Then we watch the movie with George C Scott.  We thought it was wonderful.  We saw a part of history that happened in the 1930's and was very impressed.  It was amazing the amount of actual footage they had.
0307476464|5.0|This was the first of Murakami's books I read, having seen a review of it in the New York Times or Washington Post.  I put it on my Kindle, and made a few attempts at starting it.  It was so odd, so slow, that I'd stop.  However, one night, I persisted about 50-60 pages in, and somehow got hooked.  I'm usually \\"suspicious\\" of translated books, feeling I might not be reading the actual author, but a distortion of him.  This book, once it got going, reads very clearly and lucidly.<br />The plot, while it sounds mystical and far-fetched, actually hangs well together.  Night after night, I just kept going along with it, enjoying his excellent writing and unhurried pace.  Forget trying to describe what you're reading to someone else!<br />Intrigued, I am now reading \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" and just finished his short, but fascinating non-fiction work \\"What I Talk About When I Talk About Running\\".<br />I am hooked, and have now found my new, favorite author!
B00CS65QGW|5.0|Funky and dancable music. Good music for everyone in the family. I heard it on the radio and had to buy it.
B005LAIH2M|2.0|OMG, someone finally ripped off Van Helsing! Actually, more like  mated it with The Man with the Iron Fists. Lest it not be clear, I loathed Van Helsing. It is, in my humble opinion, one of the worst big budget films of all time. Hansel & Gretel is actually better. Not a lot better mind you, but watchable in a sort of horrifying way.<br /><br />At least it feels like a single unified \\"vision.\\" Cough cough. The film is consistent in tone. But what a strange tone! In some ways, it's a faithful spawn of the original fairy tale (or Satan), but it steals from and mashes in every conceivable bit of jazzed up bad video game / comic sensibility and time period, over-the-top and almost post-modern humor, then goes for the utter gusto.<br /><br />Some interesting (and terrifying) observations about the film: It apparently cost only $50 million to make. Actually fairly cheap given the number of sets and constant fx shots. They clearly didn't spend the money on the stars. We all know Jeremy Renner to be under a curse that magically compels him to take every role offered. On the scary side H&G did over $200 million worldwide and a sequel is in production. Spare us now!<br /><br />Probably the thing that most offends me is the fundamental tonal blend. At some level, one might consider this a horror film, and there is a creepy ass story that could be made out of the original fairy tale. If you lost the we-already-know-it intro and immersed us in a dark forest period village where children were being murdered and the townsfolk turned upon themselves -- that could have worked. But H&G eschews subtlety at any and all levels. The scenario makes a high level sense (i.e. you can mostly follow the \\"plot\\"), but the world building does not. Where is this? When is this? It looks like a 19th century -- no maybe 17th -- village. But we have half-indestructible heroes, more witches than children, machine-gun crossbows, multi-stage bullets, witches better at high-wire hand to hand combat than curses, love-struct trolls, and so much more. It's just plain bizarre. There is even this major scene in the middle where a rape  and a fumbling love encounter are intercut. Woah! And weird.<br /><br />Unlike its putrescent progenitor, Van Helsing, I think H&G actually leans on sets instead of CGI for the locations. They  filmed it in Germany. This leant (some) of the backgrounds a slightly realistic touch, if a bit Grim Brothers Kitsch. The post-300  costumes and props -- not so much. Also very hit or miss is the flip dialog, mostly consisting of Gretel's one liners and ham-handed exposition aimed at explaining what passes for plot. The witchy plan is so laughable that I wonder if the outline wasn't done by the writer's eight year-old son: Wait for Blood Moon, grab twelve kids (for sacrifice), plus dine on heart of Great White Whale (wait, didn't I mean Witch?).<br /><br />You might wonder why I mentioned The Man with the Iron Fists, even though it's an entirely different action sub-genre. But both films take a similar (and oddball) approach at amping and aping the conventions of their betters. They place wire-flying blood-spurting quip-shouting action at the forefront, forgetting that this is meaningless if you don't actually have characters you care about. Or a world that makes sense. And both films have this Tarantino inspired tone that forbades any suspension of disbelief -- while failing to understand any of the stylistic talents of the master.<br /><br />Oh yes, and shall we mention that it's pretty damn gory. Mixed in with all the camp, there are some horrific deaths here, which further lends to the incredibly odd stylistic tone. Toss into that the haphazard attempt to give both leads romantic interests. Wow, this creates some skin crawling awfulness. I didn't know who to be me more uncomfortable for: the writers, producers, actors, characters, or just me! That intercut rape scene. Shiver. Not like it's \\"the ear scene\\" in Reservoir Dogs or anything, but the clash of elements is so startlingly inappropriate, I don't even know what to say.<br /><br />If this is the new normal, shoot me with a gatling crossbow now!<br /><br />Andy Gavin, author of The Darkening Dream and Untimedlash of elements is so startlingly inappropriate, I don't even know what to say.<br /><br />If this is the new normal, shoot me with a gatling crossbow now!<br /><br />Andy Gavin, author of The Darkening Dream and Untimed
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|Cute fun game.. Good graphics... Finger will get tired doing that circle thing as fast as you can... Haven't gotten into it that far yet, but so far so good
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The  cast of characters,  the plot twists,  the culture,  it  is  just captivating.  My wife  and I find ourselves intending to watch<br />one episode  and  sitting through  two more  and wishing that we had the  time  to watch even more.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This movie was very interesting and full of twists and turns. I did not forsee what was to come in the end.
125000098X|5.0|I have read, thru the years, every book Jeffrey Archer has written. He makes me<br />stay up late at night reading his books....Seriously, hard to put down and I am so<br />pleased with this series. I believe it is his first series. Thanks Jeffrey Archer for always<br />making me look for the next book you write....and sometimes I have to wait 6-8 months.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My whole family gets in on the action with the cute lol minions! From my two yr old son and four year old daughter to me and my Husband ...we all four love it! Lots of laughter.
0316247545|5.0|This was a huge hit with my niece for her 5th birthday. It's pretty wordy, and she can barely read, and it's background on the ponies. But she seriously stopped opening presents to sit down and &#34;read&#34; it, and loves it. The cover makes it look like some sort of fairy tale tome, which I think she thought was pretty cool. Highly recommended for little girls that love My Little Ponies.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Vince Gill is one of my very favorite singers. He does not sound like everybody else as many is Nashville do today, where you cannot tell one from singer from the other. His sound is unique. I personally do not enjoy the nashville music of today. These songs are very enjoyable and Vince Gill sings them only as he can.
1250000971|5.0|Not a book I would recommend for church library but a great book.<br />Only reason I say that is because I help out in a church library at present time.<br />I do NOT put his book there but have always loved the way he writes.....and<br />read every book he writes.
B003MC5AV2|5.0|Loved it!!<br />Wouldn't mind seeing this book made into a movie!!<br />Enjoyed the Beatles being incorporated into the story as well...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Same quality acting and writing that we saw in the first two seasons! Worth watching on Amazon! But it was sad!
0374533571|2.0|I read this before I watched the movie.<br /><br />I wish I'd have just watched the movie.<br /><br />I *have* bipolar. The movie cut quick to my heart because the screen portrayal is so much more accurate. The book, however, insinuates that because Pat Peoples has bipolar he is unable to do things for himself and needs to constantly be told what to do and can't live on his own because of it.<br /><br />That. Is. Crap.<br /><br />I hate how his illness was portrayed in the book. Like a helpless twelve year old because he suffers from a mental disease. This book really got under my skin about it. Yes, bipolar affects some people like that. But the distinction between the majority and the main character was never written in this book, which is a big deal to me. For me, this book is to the negative mental health image I fight every day as to what Bella Swan is for feminism.<br /><br />Don't bother reading this. Just go watch it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is the best game ever. It is the best game ever challenging and fun at the same time.<br />#justsayin
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Helps with memory for me. Good game for all ages.<br />Got hooked on the game and couldn't put it down.
B00E7SID9G|5.0|I came to this book with an open mind, coming from of Christian background myself, expecting - due to bad interviews and shocking press coverage of the book that I had seen - to read a biased book.  I found that the authors writing was nothing of the sort, and that his methodological approach to facing the facts was literary and striking.  I would suggest this book to anyone who has an interest in the origins of Christianity and an interest in the life and times of Jesus.
B00CEK9OTM|5.0|Installed it on a Asus Infinity TF700T tablet, and it runs and looks great. The option to tilt the tablet slightly helps with glare, but makes it kind of awkward to control.<br /><br />My only suggestion would be to allow the user to rotate the screen to landscape.
B002E2M3KC|5.0|Firstly, I must say that it does sound brilliant on vinyl and even for a repressing is not 'walled' or compressed beyond belief that leads to distortion as many have been.  Though I will say that it wasn't through AMAZON that I listened to it, as when this arrived it was WARPED beyond belief, probably the worst warp I've ever seen. This was just one out of FOUR records that I got in this order that were WARPED to some degree from AMAZON. One had the labels bubbled causing the warp, and the other was again the record being warped! I wish i could recommend buying this from AMAZON, being at such a good price that has kept me buying even since I've had 7 records in the last year that I've had to get refunds that were \\"WARPED\\"! This was the last record I ordered and will be from AMAZON after being told numerous times that feedback would be given to their \\" Fulfilment Centre\\" ( there's some irony in the that being the name of it, if you catch my drift) , which unlike the greatness of this album on vinyl, has fallen on deaf ears!! Seek it out and enjoy!
B002N44XSG|5.0|I already have read the percy Jackson books so new adventures was awesome!! Basically this is a book with three mini stories. I read in hours!!
B0015RFCZ0|4.0|A great movie for both kids and adults. MY 10 yr old grand daughter and I watched the movie together. There were a couple things I had to explain a little deeper for her age group to understand but she watched the whole movie with me and says it is one of her very favorites... &#34;except for the sad parts&#34; she says!
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|There seems to be a lot of negativity towards this movie, I'm not sure why. Some people complain that they reference earlier movies too much, my thoughts on this are that it is an alternate timeline. Some things are going to happen that are very similar, I don't have an issue with this. Others complain that it is not Sci-fi enough. This is true, it is an action movie, definitely. BUT... so are most of the other Star Trek movies. The only hard sci-fi Star Trek was The Motion Picture and a majority of people hate that movie. That was hard sci-fi, people. Make up your minds. This is a good movie, it's not meant to replace the original movies, it exists alongside them. The originals are always there for you to go back and enjoy. I don't really want the same stories that I have already seen, I welcome the changes that are being made. Anyway, I have a feeling this movie is going to provide a branching off point where they will be free to take the franchise in new directions that are not as referential to the originals.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put the book down! It was a well written story from beginning till end! Looking forward to reading the other books!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app I just think that gru tokens should be easier to get.Overall this game is amazing though.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|So often, films about natural disasters seem to be overwhelmingly artificial looking. I expected the same. I was wrong. By whatever means, the makers of this film were able to make a tsunami look as real as those news film clips from the actual event. The nasty facts of what happens to people must be conveyed in a PG manner, but the myriad tales here were conveyed at just the right level of breath-taking family theater. My pre-teens were amazed, but not frighted more than necessary. Amazing story.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|enjoyed as usual - has not lost a step, but perhaps has gained a few more - worth to keep watching.
B003ITZBXQ|4.0|This was a really good movie! I particularly like Morgan Freeman and he made this movie live. I highly recommend it.
B000X2H8G4|3.0|I bought this sound amplifier for a relative who is hard of hearing but eschews the use of hearing aids.  It works but if you are using this to amplify TV for example, it also amplifies all the ambient noise in the room.  Depending on how far you are away from the TV speakers it makes listening to TV programs undesirable.  This is due to the other noises that accompany the desired program.  I don't recommend it for that reason.  Of course, the same ambient noises are amplified during conversations but it is a little less distracting.  It will not replace hearing aids because it is not at all selective.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Really good. Great music especially if you were a teenager in the 70's or 80's. I never knew so much of the great songs of the era came out of one place.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I think this is the best book out of the first two, because there is a lot more communication done between Gideon and Eva. Things happen but they face them together instead of running. I still love the plot that this story has taken.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Watch this to &#34;get&#34; all of those pop culture references that otherwise would fly right over your head... Daleks, anyone?
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I highly recommend it.  It was laugh out loud funny even for an adult!  I went to see the second one shortly after renting this
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|I have read 10 JR novels and this is one of Childs best.Jack and his Army buddies take care of business Reacher style.Good read.
B005544TRQ|5.0|If I loved this series any more, I would never get anything accomplished!  I am shocked and amazed by how good each episode is.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Start with the premise of a young near genius with a secret to hide and develop the story with a world-wise mentor and add dashes of villainy, betrayals, sexual conflcits, and consistently clever story lines. Then wrap it all in excellent writing and actors gifted in portraying nuances, and you have a terrifically entertaining series. Unlike Damages (which I would give more than 5 stars, if possible), each episode of Suits is self-contained; you can skip around, miss some, and it does not matter.Try it; you'll like it!
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|Such a good movie! My husband and I went to the theaters to see this. James Franco is hilarious! It's your typical Disney movie with good versus evil and a love story combined.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Loved this game! It was challenging but fun and relaxing. Just wish it had more levels!<br /><br />The levels are not very difficult but keeps your mind occupied!
B009K0P10K|4.0|I enjoy this show and this episode did not disappoint me!  Video quality and sound were very good.  I plan on watching remaining episodes soon.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Very addictive show.  Love the chemistry between Peter and Walter Bishop.  I am now viewing the second season.  Mindless scifi fun.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|The game was fun until the update now I can't evn play it. It tells me tht the download was not complete rifgth n it nvr fixxes no matter wat I do! The bugs need to get fix
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Time telling movie with great scenery. I can see it over and over again. You must see it again and again.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|The special effects were fantastic but the story line was predictable. I found this to be very similar to The Matrix.
B00459EZLW|4.0|Season 2 extends the story line of season 1 with some new character and social developments. Some characters seem stuck, however, and could use some better writing. Acting for the more developed characters is excellent. I am just very disappointed that this series was canceled. There was so much more it could have explored in characters and sociological structures.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The book had a slow start. It was very interesting as I got further into the book. I couldn't put it down. Very expressive and detailed. I really thought it was  very . well written.
1451696191|5.0|I read it with my best friend. We fell in Love with every little event in this book. If you haven't read it yet, Please get started.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The book keeps your interest as chapters are short and go back and forth in time. The story pulls you in and keeps constant interest.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|I have listened to this over and over M83 gets this right for the movie. The movie is also great.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I didn't think it was going to be fun at all but I find myself addicted to it!<br />It is so much fun for any age!
0525478817|5.0|Great book. Hazel...Thank you for teaching me more about beauty,Gus you loved Hazel and that portraying of love was amazing.
B005I4JG80|5.0|I wish I could have read this before I had my baby.  Working on it now and while I may not practice everything it says, I like the information.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|So awesome<br />I can't believe how much fun it is.<br />So exciting when you build your collection or prizes!!!!<br />Way to go!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I will not continue the Series - The book became very repetitious, boring.  How many times can one screwed up charter mistreat a female and the stupid female keeps going back for more.  This book was typical trash, with an ending so the reader would waste their time reading the next book.
0553593714|5.0|I got this for my boyfriend once he finished Wheel of Time series because he had the blues after finishing the last book. He LOVED it and has subsequently purchased the rest of the books. It arrived very quickly, excellent shipping.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Nice storyline great suspense and action.  Wholesome entertainment the whole family can enjoy together.  Try it I think you will enjoy this show.
B0031RS44S|4.0|Trouble is a word you world associate with Jack more like Revenge you do not mix with Jack and his old MP unit because you will not win. Jack is the ultimate hero and everyone avenging angel. this is a great read and I think the best of Jack Reacher as it explains just what make him who he is.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game I get to build the dream world I always wanted. It is like I am the president of the game. I recommend that you get this game it is very fun.
B00BESM14U|4.0|It would have helped if they had at least set this film in the 1980s or early 90s.  Nothing in this film is applicable to high schools nowadays.<br />The level of homophobia is very small in major suburban schools, and no one listens to The Smiths, anymore.  I graduated college not too long ago and I've never even seen a typewriter; most people from my generation would rather throw them in the trash because they are inefficient and bulky.<br />I was probably the only one in my high school who loved The Smiths.  While I would have loved to have a quirky group of friends like those portrayed in the movie, high school isn't like that anymore.  I wish there were people like that in my high school; I would have been much happier.

B0031RS4V6|4.0|Jack can't help himself where he sees injustice being done. A suspected Kidnap makes with more twists and turns but Jack does his own thing and once again is the hero just to disappear into the night. Loved it.
B004RKXHZY|4.0|This was such a sweet story! I really enjoyed this book. A great addition to Anna and the French kiss!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This show is Epic! If you have not seen this show I highly suggest it. This boxed DVD set would make a great gift to yourself!
0440246008|3.0|Jack Reacher is quite a creation.  He's immensely popular, and has made his creator lots and lots of money.  He is also really boring.  He has no emotions, attaches himself to nothing and no one, never goes through any kind of emotional growth or evolution, and kills lots (and lots)of people without being affected by it one iota.  In the languages of English teachers, he is a static character.  Static, as in he is exactly the same at the end of the book as he is at the beginning.  I gave up on this series in 2007.<br /><br />I gave this book three stars because the writing is good enough to distract you from the complete lack of character development, as well as some obvious blunders throughout the book.  Lots of people love it, God knows why.  Just look at the slew of five-star reviews.  Have any of those five-star reviewers read Graham Greene or Eric Ambler, I wonder.<br /><br />I found this book in a box in my storage unit.  Apparently I bought it back in 2006 or 2007.  I wouldn't have boxed it if I hadn't read it, but I had no memory of having read it, so I picked it up and began.  About half-way through, I realized why I had forgotten it.  Reacher is boring in his omnipotence (In this book, he does have brief moments of doubt.  Whoopee.), and virtually no character in the book is developed.  The bad guys are obvious cannon fodder from the beginning, kind of like in an episode of the old TV series, \\"Combat\\", that began with the squad getting \\"replacements\\".  You knew that they'd all be dead by the end.  The head bad guy is a two-dimensional sociopath, and that might be giving him one dimension too many.  There is a sex-interest.  Not a \\"love\\" interest, because Reacher doesn't love anybody.  There are a couple of formulaic sex scenes that read just like the formulaic sex scenes in other Reacher books.<br /><br />I get the impression that Lee Child maybe read \\"Shane\\", or saw \\"Yojimbo\\" and \\"Sanjuro\\", just fell in love with the idea of the wandering hero who moves on at the end, and keeps writing the same book over and over again.  Because the series is so popular, I see that Child has effectively plugged into the current American zeitgeist.  Good for him.  Everyone has to earn a living, but the fact that a character like Reacher is so appealing is both unusual and a bit disturbing.<br /><br />Anyway, now that I've reread \\"The Hard Way\\", I'm undoubtedly going to forget it again.  As one reviewer on the back of the book says, \\"Child knows every trick in the book\\".  Yes, he does, but even really good writing about a total bore gets old.  I'm donating this to the local library.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game is the most fun Bingo there is but a bit frustrating as well.  I can only get on to play at certain times on my kindle but it works perfectly on my computer.  Love the inter action; the voices: and the graphics.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This calculator has a far superior interface than the \\"stock\\" app that arrived on a Sprint HTC EVO LTE. Nice high contrast display; presumably it does accurate mathematical calculations!<br /><br />While the ads are not overly intrusive, if you use this a lot, definitely consider the [[ASIN:B007EC27QM ad-free version]] (for less than a buck...what's not to like).
B00881VLCE|4.0|The update fixed my pet peeve: the screen rotates both directions now. A little less easy to see the pieces, but the rotation thing makes up for it.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|I read this at the demand of a friend of mine. I like this book a lot in spite of not being a fan of the fantasy genre. The writing was clear and easy to read with a style that allowed me to conjure up a vivid world. It was slightly reminiscent of Harry Potter but for adults.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|It could be considered &#34;weird&#34;. The whole concept of an &#34;alternate universe&#34; is definitely strange. I find it very intriguing. Excellent acting by all.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I tend not to write descriptions of the plot. I loved this book. Parts of it are almost like being lost in a fairy tale, other parts feel very deep and almost existential. If you want something straight forward and obvious, this is not the book for you. If you enjoy being transported to where the line between what we experience as real and what is real is blurred, you will likely love this book.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|I really enjoy movies with a twist. The twist here is a false attorney that never went to college being hired into a law firm that only hires attorneys that graduate from Harvard. Leads into a lot of crazy situations. Really like it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Lots of fun.  Good game that keeps interest. Love to play.<br />Good layout easy to play. Would love more ways to get credits.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Enjoyable - I felt that the father's character could have been developed more to show the connection between the father and son and the mother's role in attempting to protect both of them.
B00DHHWY9I|4.0|If you didn't see it in a theater and you are curious about this one then get it. It is a simple entertaining movie. Don't expect it to be as good as the book. But it is still a good Friday night movie. It has a slow start but it soon gets better. I have come to expect more from the movies where Dicaprio is the main character, maybe that is why I give this one a 4/5<br /><br />Plot 7/10<br />Acting 8/10<br />Overall entertainment 8/10
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|Mainly got this for my grandchildren. The 8 year old spent some time with it but it didn't engage her as long as some other apps. I &#34;played with it&#34; but never even realized it was a game.  Someday I'll have the 8 year old give me further instructions.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|This book had me cracking up from one page to the next. I liked that it was told from the male point of view. I really liked both characters. It's definitely a keeper!!
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I was playing M:TG in the Unlimited days, and still have a vault of cards stashed safely away. Stopped playing actively due to kids growing up and the too-rapid change in expansions and rules, and the expense of keeping a competitive deck. Saw the app and said, for free, why not. While many cards are new and some changes have taken place, it remains a great game concept, and the app plays easily for anyone familiar with the game. On my kindle, I wish I could zoom in the view at times, but overall, it enables a good simulacrum of a real game, without any of the distracting habits of some human players. Now I find myself thinking &quot;why not pay for the full game&quot;. A slippery slope my friends. If you want a hand portable M:TG fix, this is the answer.
B008JFUPOY|3.0|Fraternities majors, area studies, final exams and other university standard subjects don't necessarily make a good story for kids. My kids enjoyed it but they quite didn't understand what exactly was going on. It is a good prequel, but it feels more oriented to parents or bigger kids rather than young ones. Not because it is inappropriate, but because it is a bit to complex of a story. But it is a great movie that explains how Mike and Sully became friends and ended-up working us a team at the energy plant<br /><br />Acting (voice) 8/10<br />Animation (CGI) 9/10<br />Plot 6/10 (not exactly kid oriented)<br />Overall entertainment 8/10
B0019IB0II|5.0|We saw Jill Bolte Taylor interviewed on television and we were fascinated.  She has survived a very tragic situation and along with her training in neurology, her inate curiosity and her sense of humor she has been able to give us a wonderful insight into those afficted from a stroke. Having had a grandfather who lived with us after having several strokes and watching him anguish with the change in his abilities I have always wondered what was still locked up in his mind and what could I have done to help him adjust. Jill's mother was an amazing partner in her recovery.  Both Jill and her mother's perspectives are valuable tools for those of us who may be participants in such a tragedy.
B00B2166BS|5.0|I was skeptical at first, but this thing really works. First, it's magnetic so it attaches easily and you don't have to worry about bending the connector - it just pops off under any strain.  But the real magic is the charge rate. Unlike charging with the micro USB, which can take up to 10 hours hours for a full charge and sometimes cannot even keep up with the discharge rate, the pogo charger does a great job.  I have not done any metered test comparison, but it feels like it charges 4x - 5x the micro- USB, and still charges when watching videos.  Note that you MUST use the Samsung adapter that came with the nexus 10, or one with the same amperage rating. A normal USB charger puts out a trickle charge and the pogo needs to deliver a lot more current to charge at its max rate.
B007L5LD9O|2.0|I was bored stiff throughout the movie. Could not get into the melodramatic movie. The acting was good for a boring subject
0553801473|3.0|As a fan of the aSoIaF series, I have to say, I understand why the series has come under scrutiny post-Storm of Swords. After that book, which was the best in the series (well-plotted, fast moving, just overall awesome), a Feast for Crows was released, which showed a noticeable slowing down of things. I believe George RR Martin, while still being able to write beautifully and create whole characters, has lost his ability of pacing the story well. Ultimately, A Dance with Dragons, like aFfC, suffers the same problems, but this time even more so than its predecessor.<br /><br />At least in aFfC, things were kicking into high-gear in the last 150 pages or so. A Dance with Dragons only became exciting to me in the last chapter and the epilogue. The first three books were filled with exciting moments placed throughout the story--that's why they call them 'page-turners'. Getting through this book at times was a struggle. When I got to chapters that I knew would be boring (Barristan Selmy and Quentyn, for example), the only thing that got me through it was flipping ahead and seeing that a Reek or Arya chapter was soon to follow. Don't get me wrong, I like Barristan Selmy and Quentyn, but particularly with Dany's story in Meereen, barely ANYTHING happens in the book. It is paced so poorly that I really feel like half of her chapters could've been axed. Also, what is up with the ONE Jaime chapter in which, again, basically nothing happens? Martin ended aFfC with this huge (and kind of lame) cliffhanger with Brienne...and when we finally see her again, we learn absolutely nothing. We're just left with another cliffhanger, this one just lamer than the last.<br /><br />There are still occasional bright spots in aDwD, particularly with the Dreadfort/Stannis scenes in the North and Victarion Greyjoy. Theon has always been a compelling character to me (I believe Bran will communicate through him through the weirwoods and the ravens), and Victarion's storyline is very well done. Heseems like a menacing guy, and I can't wait to see how he ties into the main plot concerning Dany.<br /><br />So, in summary, I hope George RR Martin has recognized the pacing problem his last two novels have suffered from. Fans are still invested in this story and these characters, but please, get things moving! We read a nearly 1000 page book, and the events that actually happened that were interesting and of importance probably could've been condensed into 500 pages. In the end, aDwD builds up to two major battles that NEVER HAPPEN!
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto do an excellent job of reprising their roles of the iconic crew of the Enterprise.  Perfect for those that loved the &#34;classic&#34; Star Trek and yet answers the call for any new fans as well.
B001RMYWG8|5.0|Great movie but streaming was a little choppy at times . Pacino was great!  great on location scenes of 1970s NYC.
B00CO52NLI|3.0|It's fun at first, but all you can take care of is guinea pigs and hamsters unless you want to pay. But it's ok for a free game.
B0031RS4UM|4.0|Terrific light reading for those who enjoy heaps of action and for their heroes to be larger than life, Jack Reacher is todays Paladin.
B000I3SYEI|5.0|I really liked this movie.  It had some great moments that were intense.  The ending was amazing and made me want to watch another one.
B007THA4FI|5.0|It is JK but not Harry, more adult and more internal. No quidditch here. It's also a lot more British. Some of the terms stumped me and the Kindle dictionary. It goes quickly and keeps the reader wanting more. It's dark too. I cried.
B002S9DRA6|5.0|I have all the Enigma CD's and the 3rd CD from this set is my favorite.  There is no singing or vocal just music. I like it so much that I have it as my alarm clock.
159463176X|5.0|I have to start this review by saying that Hosseini is such a talented and gifted writer that I would probably happily pay for and read his laundry list. And in this regard, this book did not disappoint. That said, although I enjoyed this book, it was my least favorite of his three novels, not due to writing style, which is beautiful, but simply because I felt there were too many stories being simultaneously told and I had to stop several times and actively think about the characters' connections to one another. In fairness to this book, it was also the first time I read a book on Kindle and adjusting to that may have played a part, however I still give it five stars and hope for a fourth book from Hosseini.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was really surprised to find how insightful this book is. Card describes how rotten and evil humans behave, but he does so with the voice of a historian, presenting the story as if it were a victory of good. It is only the victorious who gets a chance to write down and present their version of history, and no victorer would proclaim himself to be evil. Very well done, indeed.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I spent half off the weekend watching season 3 all in one sitting and was wishing for more at the end. Can't wait until season 4!
B00A285OOW|5.0|Loved this &#34;sequel&#34; to the White Queen. Interesting viewpoints, especially Elizabeth of York's. Makes me want to read more about the real history of Henry VII's reign. (I'll admit I'm a bit biased, because I really enjoy most of this author's novels about the Wars of the Roses).
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|The story line and acting is fantastic. Some unanswered questions are forgotten as you gravitate to predictability in this otherwise awesome visual experience. I like most every turn in the plot and highly recommend to ardent sci-fi fans.
B005IYNQAY|4.0|The book is excellent in its own unique way to approach the complicated matter of cohabitants that are literally worlds apart.<br /><br />Sadly, it is as if the proofreaders didn't finish their work. The book was obviously scanned with OCR, and about half way through the book a lot of obvious OCR errors start to emerge. You can still read and understand the text, but it is annoying.
B008Y6YCB0|4.0|enjoyed the movie. it's hard to find a good clean movie, but this is a good one.<br />would recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game, really realistic. However it takes too much money to ready your horse for competitions.<br />And their needs to b  more ways to get your health and happiness up.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great storylines, and dialogue. Originally saw an episode on a flight and was instantly hooked. Unfortunately makes the American version pale in comparison.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Wasn't the best but it did the job that I wanted and took okay quality pictures. I would rather use my camera or phone to take pictures with.
B0037XPP7U|3.0|but it's okay.  I guess it's one of those movies you need to watch several times before it's sinks in.  if that 's the case, it's great.
140191716X|5.0|Was looking for something just like this book.Daily use really keeps me in touch with my spiritual side. love it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Masterpiece Theater is a class act...wonderfully done! Acting, setting, direction, costuming is outstanding.<br />Story is captivating as well as brilliant.
B00AR83PN4|3.0|This was a fast game but I just don't get the jist of it and so I will not paly it anymore.
0446554995|5.0|I am huge Preston & Child fan............ l read all the Pendergast series and anxiously await any new books that come out.<br />In a couple of years I intend to re-read the entire series again............. looking forward to it.<br />S. George
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Such a beautiful book. It made me laugh and it made me cry. As an F1 fan, I enjoyed a lot of the racing refrences.
B0058YPL66|5.0|Imaginative take on fairy tale characters.  I liked the first season.  How the show does will depend on how they continue to develop it.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|My son loves this game and he plays it often and for a long time.  The animations are very cute.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Never gives you shadows you need. Everyone begs and begs for them. Wastes of credits and time. Yet everyone is an addict
B000089RV6|5.0|If you like '80's metal rock, you'll love this album. It is the quintessential rock album. The lyrics are a little over-sexed, but not crude.
B001Q7JD3Q|5.0|Haven't seen this movie in forever so I mostly forgot about it! I'm so glad I saw it again. It is fantastic and it is worth getting the extended version!
B008VBYN80|5.0|GEt dis game it so good except for the need to purchase diamonds from time to time it's good!!!<br />I'm going crazy aren't I
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|Not very challenging but it's okay.  I play it to put my mind at ease - so to relax and it's fun.
B00DUHT3OO|4.0|Good to reread the book and filter out the differences in original writing and movie adaptations. Austen's writing in this edition was a bit over the top description sometimes, but well worth reading
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is an outstanding example of a YA fantasy book that hits all the right chords. As with much of fantasy in general, the situation is dire, and instructions are few. So a quest must be undertaken to save the world, and so it goes. However, Sabriel differs from most in that the characters are real, the plot is lucid, and the writing is nothing short of brilliant.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this series to any fan of good fantasy, not just YA. It's one third of an amazing trilogy, and stands on its own quite well.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|The book was great can't wait until the movie and to start the second book I bet it will be great
B001K3KK0Q|1.0|Mia and Robert brought no depth at all to these characters, they just looked pretty. Didn't care for this enough to finish it
B008D37J6O|2.0|It worked just fine for my ex nd and his wife. They used the player to watch illegal porn and the audio and video they took of me when I thought I was home alone. I must not forget to mention the clarity of the video that was taken unknown to me of our sex. It looks fantastic on this player with its hidden video and audio options. Thanks for playing your little part in ruining my life. You and the million other spyware creators!
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I downloaded this for my kindle fire HD and I like that it's really clear but I don't really understand it when I want to view other youtube channels don't know how.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|I feel much smarter after viewing this film! I could have easily bought the iTunes version of the the movie and soundtrack buuuuut I feel like Dave Grohl would be disappointed with me! Haha
B007SGM084|5.0|This series was my first ever adult contemporary erotic read.  I have read many books released since Fifty Shades.  I really like the writing style in this series.  I found Anastasia's \\"inner goddess\\" entertaining and would like mine to pipe up more often.  I think Christian's POVwould be an interesting read.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|Great and funny for toddlers! ! Will keep them busy for a long while.... for busy mom who need to get stuff done
0439813786|5.0|This is a book i found stimulating -- even startling -- with respect to it's message and form.  It's rare to find novels that young adults will read that address important philosophical themes such as the meaning of life, purpose in the universe, ethics (how we should live our lives) and so forth, and all of it through characters we actually care about.  The film by Scorsese -- inspired directly by the book -- is also fantastic!
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|This game started out fun and I played it for a few days. Then I came back to it and it had deleted all of my data! Hours of work gone for no reason.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|It takes a lot of time to get thru the Game of thrones series. You almost need to keep a flow chart handy to keep track of the characters. A very good read, just dont plan on getting any housework done. Cant wait for next book.
B0000042GM|5.0|Cliburn may've bested him on Brahms overall, but Katchen's Handel Variations are the best ever recorded...by anybody!  It's one of the treasures of recorded piano.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|The acting was believable and good and true to the book.  This is the most complete version I have seen.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|There is nothing new added to this game except glitchy graphics and impossibly high prices for the same items. There is no possible way to play long enough to get 250000 coins. No Ussain Bolt as promised. This app is not worth the download.
B00064X3FO|5.0|I got this for the SACD multichannel mix and am very satisfied with it. The sound is much better than that of the original CD, being warmer and crisper at the same time. The multichannel mix is great too, not too cumbersome or weird, keeping Elton's voice squarely in the middle while immersing you in the music.
034537410X|5.0|love learning more about lucid dreaming. I highly recommend this book if you are a curious dreamer. buy it now!
B007JNWQZS|4.0|I give this four stars.  Tarantino's great.  Great Blu-ray quality.  Excellent job.  Love Uma Thurman, too.  Very funny.  Love it.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Lots of twists, turns and old school references.  You have to watch the first one though for it to make sense.
B004ZNAXX2|4.0|You can't give a bad grade to anything Pink Floyd, but I was a bit disappointed that this box set did not have a bluray, like the other two  (DSOTM and WYWH). The sound is great, but I was really looking forward to a higher-rez sound, and felt a bit let down that they weren't clearer on that fact. That being said, it is a great collectible object, and since we fans haven't had much to add to our Pink Floyd collections in the last 15 years, it is nice to have something of this quality out there.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|I am not understanding where my pics go when I save them.  I spend time in editing & then can't find the chg'd photos.  I'll keep playing with it to learn it, but am getting frustrated.
B004SIPA4G|4.0|I give this four stars.  Tarantino's great.  Great Blu-ray quality.  Excellent job.  Love Bruce Willis, too.  Very exciting.  Love it.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|I second the other reviews.  I downloaded this book and listen to it straight through.  I spent the next three days listening to the next six books in the series.  The combination of the author and the reader (George Guidall) is an unbeatable combination.  After listening to the seven books, I found there was a TV series.  I found the series on the internet and watched the first one.  I could not reconcile the charters drawn in my mind by Craig Johnson and George Guidall with the TV series.  So I'll just stick with the Audible books.  I recommend the series.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I am far from this lifestyle, yet I have tremendously enjoyed this show. It is smartly done and well acted. Hugely entertaining. Ron Perlman is superb in his role, and the storyline gets more and more intriguing as time goes by.
B000002H38|5.0|Anita Baker is awesome on this CD. When it first came out on cassette tape I played it until it wore out. Now to have it on CD is wonderful. Her sound is flawless and timeless.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I have read all of Liane's books.  I have loved them all.  This one is the best by far...all the way to the epilogue.  This book will be on my mind for awhile.  Highly recommend.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is the best series of books I have read. It is very interesting and I read it while watching HBO's drama which helped me picture the characters and keep them straight,
B004ZNARH4|5.0|Except for the fact they added the word &#34;The&#34; in front of it, I am loving this box set. The Bluray disc sounds superb, and is better yet than the SACD recording. The packaging is great and the set is a wonderful addition to any serious Pink Floyd collection out there.
B006QPX7UI|5.0|My wife, two sons and I rented this movie before we went to Gettysburg. It was over 4hrs but an 8 and 10 year old boys were able stay interested in it. We learned a lot.
B005F6NA56|5.0|I've listened to several of her albums (all good), but this one is the best (in my opinion).  I especially love &#34;The Bad In Each Other&#34; and &#34;Comfort Me.&#34;
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Loved the game!  The only drawback is there is only 10 levels.  Finished in 2 days.  Hope more levels are added.

0385349947|5.0|Sandberg is an amazing woman.  So glad I sprung for this book.  She gives girls and young women something to aspire to.
0321934318|3.0|The book contains no quick overall guide. The text is extremely technical. Many pictures are small and quite often dull.
B002ZG99IG|5.0|I ordered this movie without watching it beforehand. I was not disappointed! It thoroughly creep-ed me out and made me cringe. The movie arrived quickly and in great condition.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Very interesting. These books can keep your attention all the way through. I can't wait to read through the next one.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I use this every morning and get to choose different songs to wake up to its great that it gasses in so as not to startle my infant awake when I get up to workout.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Loved the book and the film. I will re-read it soon. Too many questions! Why do I need to write so much?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is amazing! It is so much fun to play and you will never get tired of playing it. I recommend this to everyone.
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|This was my favorite show at the time and I still enjoy it and have the same emotional ties to the characters. The picture was exquisite & the 5.1 was awesome!  Much better then watching on Netflix.
B005HSL626|5.0|It works great I like playing it and my kids love it, no problems and no ads which are a plus
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|I liked it for its message for kids to believe in their talents as they grow up from youth amen
B004XUMMFE|5.0|One of the classic favorites of mine.  I have watched several times and when nothing else appeals it is always one I enjoy watching over.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I read this book for the first time I was caught off guard by its very vivid and descriptive sex scenes. But soon I was able to put it on the back burner and see the story for what it also is: a love story. Two unlikely people coming together, though they come from different backgrounds and experiences (sexual and otherwise), they find themselves changing for one another. Hell, it sounds like Beauty and Beast just with a lot of sex scenes. I think the development of the characters is profound even in the first book. I loved it! Porn and all ;)
B003XDZN8A|3.0|I won't receive the Crocs for another couple months as they were shipped to a friend who will bring them to Mexico when he returns to his winter home. I expect to love them.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I am not very smart but made it through with the hints and enjoyed every minute of it even when stumped. Very good
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|After listening to Paradise Valley a couple time  I have fallen in love with it.  The sound is very easy going and lyrics are wonderful.  No this is not continuum, but he seems to be moving away from that genre with his last 2 albums.

B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Jack Reacher is my favorite fictional character. He is not your usual fictional hero. He has his own unique style.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I installed this app for my Samsung Galaxy S4 but for some reason I cannot read any of the books I've purchased. It keeps on giving me an error message that I needed to upgrade the app even though I already have the latest version. I installed, uninstalled, upgraded, and it still does not work.

B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Asphalt 8 is a really intense racing game with many cars to choose from and upgrades to unlock. You race through the streets of Tokyo to Iceland. Asphalt 8 features a multiplayer mode with lots of modes and players to race against. Asphalt 8 is no doubt the best mobile racing game ever! It has amazing graphics,easy to use controls,and it just gives you this instense feeling when your playing. Best part of all,Its only $0.99! Thanks a lot for reading my review.
B005HS00NW|5.0|I am very particular about what songs I will buy on C.D. these days. This is one purchase I did not regret. The album has a sort of Pink Floyd feel to me. So if you are not into trippy interludes and experimental sound type music, then this C.D. will not be for you. But if you like that kind of music, then you will love it. I didn't like that the album was made from cardboard. But the artwork is great and you get two C.D.'s worth of music. I am happy with my purchase.

B001P06GX4|5.0|Although this game was purchased for children, their parents and grandparents monopolize it once the children turn to other activities.  The young children enjoy matching the colors,  but the adults enjoy the strategy of placing pieces.  This game is a hit in our family.
B00DI75SWM|1.0|You make one then when u try to share it it works then u make a new one then try to share the new one and it share the old one...it doesn't work not worth the 99cents or the time
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Obviously a great film, one of the best of 2012 in my opinion. The Blue ray is pretty standard for typical features.

B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Really cool.great graphics on my kindle and phone. I have recommended this silly game to my friends and after the shock from the weird namethey loved it
B00DDZM0GQ|3.0|I love, love, love this game! But once I get to level 23, the game will not load. If they fix this problem, I'd gladly give the game five stars.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Although it is the same pattern every time, you still can play the game and not feel you are making the same play every time.
B001OFJPIS|5.0|I thought it was curious how the script sort of tip-toed around the whole Prince Nuada declaring war on humans. It's obviously for \\"environmental\\" reasons. Hell, we humans are about to trash and overrun the whole planet. So a race that thrives only in \\"wild places\\" like fairies and elves would want to see us go the way of the dinosaur. But again, it's not so loudly or clearly stated.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|I liked the movie alot!!  Just one thing .....  Since Annie was Glinda, then why wasn't May, Theodora??  Also,  the storyline left me with hoping that another movie will follow. There has to be an explanation of how the 2 witches gained control of certain lands. And how Dorothy became orphaned, etc. And... I kinda wish that Johnny Depp was OZ!!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This was a great Scifi movie. For those Game of Thrones fans keep an eye out for the king slayer.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I like that each level is a new challenge. Wish it didn't take so long to get more lives though.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I was not really aware of who Bruno Mars was until I went to a concert and saw him live.  His performance was excellent.  He is a true entertainer.  I enjoyed his ability to recreate his recorded music live and the album is a refinement of his skills and talent.  I can't wait to see what he does next.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great Game had a ball testing myself. I would recommend to all ages.  very addictive sure to please all who get locker on a floor
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a puzzle game that is a mystery and I like puzzles. It has clever ways of making me use my brain.
B005HSL626|4.0|It worth this game. It is advisable to play and install this game. Very addicting and funny. I understand now why it is very famous
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|I enjoyed this work very much.  I had already bought the latest and so I wanted more and bought this out of curiosity.  I love the arrangements and the feel that Bruno is spreading his wings and finding his sound.
0385737955|4.0|I read it in a day. It is not as good as Hunger Games or Ender's Game, but it's up there.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book was a great read! From the moment I began I could hardly put it down. Very, very excellent read
B004UNX1LS|4.0|It is goot to get account of updates of music videos of this Youtube channel. Maybe, it would be better if you could receive notifications of new videos and news of this channel
B002U6CJCE|4.0|This movie is the typical Universal Soldier movie.  It has everything you would expect from a Jean Claude Van Damme movie..
B00119ZMKW|4.0|When I watched this the first time, it was hard to get past the absence of Daniel Jackson's character.  But viewing it again, there are a number of strong stories in the season and Jonas Quinn added a welcome fresh viewpoint.  Still not the strongest of the seasons in Stargate's long run but well worth watching
0061992860|5.0|This book is a Keeper. I will carry it around with me till I finish reading it all. then it will go strait to my urban survival pack.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|Good app. I can print files from my kindle,now. However, there should be an option to select the pages that you want to print and select the quality

B002PJN59M|5.0|I have always been infatuated with the King Arthur Legend and there are so many versions of it.<br />I really do enjoy this version.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This is the most fun I have had in a long time. I watched this movie on TV and just had to have the DVD. I especially liked the old man and his wife. He was so adventurous for his age. It deserves 5 stars for the animation and story line. It is an excellent family movie.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I knew saving my Amazon coins was a good idea! This game is awesome! Its completely different from the last one, Multiplayer doesn't lag, and As you already know, the graphics are FANTASTIC!!! Dude, the cars are so beautiful, and multiplayer is so intense! I mean, when you jump off  a ramp everyone just wants to crash into each other to win the race, its crazy! Crap, Gameloft did great on this one.
B000URWYTS|5.0|This book portrays very real characters and leads one to grapple with many issues. Especially a woman<br />s need to fulfill herself and at what cost.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I started watching this series based solely on the location shoots, but from a few minutes in... I was hooked!
B002PEP4QY|5.0|have not received this order either what is going on with you all this used to be the best shopping place I was using now I am going to start putting out the word if I don't get my orders soon.

B00CUG8GAS|3.0|Just had a hard time staying with the story. Seemed scattered.  What I did read was descriptive and interesting  Did not finish it. Thats not normal for me
B009CCBCU4|4.0|The Aztecs and their neighbors, friendly and unfriendly, and the places where they live, can have convoluted and hard-to-remember names.  As I proceeded thru the book, I jotted down each one and its significance if i knew it. This helped tremendously. The book itself was quite riveting.  Altho not always easy to read, I enjoyed it and would recommend it..

B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is really really fun and anyone would enjoy it no matter how old or young they are and the discription is totally right because the description said that they were easy but addicting and they are easy but addicting.
B00992CF6W|4.0|They should add a kick and ban button for the owner of the game because when I'm in school playing so many people join and troll me and its so annoying
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|this game is so addictive. takes a minute to figure it out but takes off after that. so much fun!!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|have been inspired by this book! Really interesting to hear others' experiences related to the Introvert—Extrovert continuum and how we view or understand our life experiences depending upon where we see ourselves on it. Quite interesting to realize the subtle expectations that our culture has placed upon us regarding how forthcoming we &#34;should&#34; be in work and relationships, but also to read about actual genetic components that may play a bigger part than previously thought. I found the Free Trait theory quite helpful in understanding how an introvert can sometimes readily learn to look like an extrovert, in service of a cherished value or goal.
0440245915|5.0|This book is a classic.  The story begins with the vicious rape and attempted murder of a young black girl by two vicious white drunken thugs, which in turn leads to their murder by the girl's father in the town's courthouse.  Up and coming local lawyer Jake Brigance takes the case for the accused's defence and his life - and that of his family, as well as most of the townsfolk - is changed forever.  The true colours of the the population of Ford County come to the fore as links to the Klu Klux Klan become apparent and all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />Grisham's writing style has always been succinct and straight to the point, with an emphasis on reader entertainment.  One can tell this was one of his earlier releases with the book tending to be a bit wordy in patches but the strength of the story telling shines like a flood light in an underground cavern.  This book raises as many questions on morals and ethics as much as it does points of law.<br /><br />There is a plethora of well drawn characters in this novel.  Most of them are good and well hearted souls, but some are mean and just plain evil.  Not to mention stupid.  Jake Brigance - the lawyer for the defence - is the star of the show but the DA is the highlight of the book for me.  Obviously, he sits on the wrong side of the law but he is easy to despise (but like) and the depth to his character is amazing.  Even the good guys are flawed.  You make one assumption about the book and its possible outcome but within a hundred pages or so your understanding of the case and the plot has evolved to a greater depth and so you come to appreciate its worth.<br /><br />Like most John Grisham novels this book takes time to mature.  With less than 200 pages to go, the trial had not even commenced.  I had my theories on what would happen as well as what had come to pass since page one but as the pages turn your education and experience grows and your perspective on everything changes.<br /><br />A TIME TO KILL is a classic update on the courtroom drama generic that is brought up to date by a master of the genre.  An easy five stars out of five.  Well done, Mr Grisham,  I can't wait for the sequel.<br /><br />BFN Greggorio.ic update on the courtroom drama generic that is brought up to date by a master of the genre.

B007AL48UK|4.0|I was looking for something different from card games and decided to try this. Can't beat it for the price
B0064MPXFA|2.0|Boring and predictable.  Could have been a good idea but poorly executed.  Solves legal issues in 30 minutes, impressive NOT
B000SXMNI6|5.0|Come on ,it's Jethro Tull. This is one of their all time a classic albums. I've got several and listen to them often.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is great - a nice mind bending game that's not too difficult and very enjoyable. I like doing a floor or two just to chill out.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|This is a pretty good game. Point of view toggle would be nice and maybe cutaway missle impacts. Radar could color code targets as  coming to and moving away from you like clear air<br />mode on a doppler weather radar.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|It was delightfully wicked and intriguing.  She just does such a fantastic job of writing evil and disturbing characters.  Great book.
1475972350|5.0|Intriguing, Very Mysterious, Different due to being written in the killers view. I was tossed in and was unable to get out. Trying to figure out all the different ideas of who, what, when, where and who the actual killer could be. Yeah!!!<br /><br />What does the killer mean by \\"Time Wasters?\\"  Would you be one in his or her mind?  I loved, screamed, hated, wondered, about threw the book a dozen or more times, all to get back in and read more until it was the end. I can't wait to read more from this amazing author.<br /><br />This is the first book that I have read by author Todd M. Thiede but it will not be the last I hope. His style shakes you up and throws you in only to make you wish that you could get the story out of your head because you are so shook up to sleep and you want to see what is going to happen next.<br /><br />I recommend this book to ALL my mystery, suspense, scary readers. Pick it up and let me know what you think...<br /><br />So due to the above, I am giving this book a Breath of Life ratings of:<br /><br />Five Clock Rating!!!<br /><br />Disclosure: I did receive this book for my honest opinion and review. But these opinions are my own and yours may differ.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Fun game but extremely difficult to aim and hit the bubble you are aiming at. It would be easier just to touch where you want to shoot the bubble.
B007STXHTM|4.0|I had the 'blur fix' housing previously.  It was ok, but this is simpler, and put together better.  I recommend it.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|We watched this probably 10 times while on a trip!  We went back last week to rent it again and it wasn't there.  My kids were really sad and we hope that it comes back soon!
B000I3PERS|5.0|I found this movie to be inspiring - showing what one man's commitment to freedom can do. The scenery was beautiful - not to mention Mel Gibson's great talent as Director. It kept me fully engaged in every moment as I watched. The best battle scenes I have every seen. I came away totally satisfied and delighted with this movie.<br />KK
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|Overall good flick with some pretty good action. Is it an amazing blockbuster...no, but it will definitely provide some good entertainment
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Once I got past the not-so-great acting, I couldn't get enough. The perfect amount of suspense and drama with some characters you will despise!
B004GK2B6Q|2.0|I actually got this by accident but thought make it was a happy mistake.  Wrong.  My kids started watching it and lost interest in the first 20 minutes.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I had to read this good book for school and I'm actually happy I did! It was a very good and enjoyable book!!!
B0050PYNP8|5.0|This was a funny, very entertaining movie.  Who can't love this little alien from space who has been trapped on our world as a &#34;guest&#34; for so many years.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|I would recommend to anyone. This is a fast pace addictive game and my husband and grandsons are in love with it.
B00A4SJ61W|4.0|Fun movie to watch.  My kids enjoy it once in a while so I will rent it for them.  Good show.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much. But I enjoyed the first and second books more it seemed that he skipped around too much the kite runner was my favourite . I hope he writes more about<br />His country. I will recommend this and his other books to my<br />Friends.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|what a great application,easy to use and very enjoyable for the young and old.especially the hd function.i am just a beginner at this.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|This season is full of strong characters, in depth and easy to follow story and plot lines. I feel that falling skies is a show that anyone who enjoys syfy needs to watch and enjoy.
B009BJATYS|5.0|Acting was very good and the costumes and sets were beautiful!  It held my attention to the very end, very enjoyable!
B009NY43NY|3.0|I loved the entire series, Sookie is awesome and all women should have a little bit of Sookie in them.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Why cannot there be this caliber of Tv all the time!  Great Tv let alone n etwork!  Highly recommended for those who like L & O with more BITE!
B009NQXXZ6|5.0|there are several movies made with this title but this is my favorite several of them were also remakes of a early classic
B001DHXT6G|3.0|I've been bench watching the original start trek series again. It's fun, but I'm finding that the first season really makes more sense if you don't watch the whole thing in one sitting. Also, with this edition, the CGI is too much. It's obviously not part of the original footage, and you can tell. That said, they did manage to clean up the ship and outdoor footage, and that looks great. Looking at it, you almost forget that it's not a newer series.<br /><br />All the cleanup has made me pay attention to little details though, that I never would have noticed before. For example, when they're on the amusement park planet. There's some red spray paint on one of the trees, and they just keep passing it. I never would have noticed that before. It's irksome. In the same episode, they keep walking on grass that's been cut. You can even see the grass trimmings under their feet. So how is it exactly, that they get to a planet where the lawn is perfect, there's obviously been lawn mowers running through there, and yet, they keep trying to convince themselves there's no life! It blows my mind.<br /><br />The other thing they did was include both pilots. And while the third episode isn't a pilot, it sort of feels like one.<br /><br />Biggest problem with this high quality remix of classic trek is that the sets look cheesier, and the monsters look more plastic like then they ever have.<br /><br />I'm not saying it's terrible, but it's not quite the trek I remember growing up with.
6305079811|4.0|I recently bought Flash Gordon for my finacee and he loved it! I ordered it for his birthday and it arrived just in time! It actually came sooner than the system stated!! The quality was great...and the packaging was in very good condition. I would recommend this seller!

B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. It's always something new. There are options to buy more credits but it's not necessary to play and have fun. Don't pay attention to the complainers there's some in every bunch. Most people are nice and very helpful. Enjoy!
B003NRYMZQ|4.0|I enjoyed this show and the characters. It is fun to see how the group works together and solves the problems created by the aliens and monsters.
B000002LFZ|5.0|a great compilation on 1 disc of 1 of the greatest modern bands of our times cthis music will never become outdated
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Book is a great read. An excellent account of a remarkable situation. It felt like I was there in the fight with the seals.  One of the best SEAL books I've ever read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of the best series I have ever watched.  It is great that with Amazon Prime you are able to watch the episodes for FREE!!!
B00860YICC|5.0|i seen the movie and love the music , so i ordered the cd it wont let  you down either great music and well recorded
B008HTQ28K|5.0|..that John Grisham is brilliant, you can continue reading.  I don't often read his books and enjoyed the Racketeer immensely.  The story built momentum and managed to keep me in suspense.  A great read.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A very high quality british saga during the transition of life in country mansion from extreme wealth to possible financial rune. It depicts complex relationships of hierarchy amoung the staff and between the staff and family.  Such a delight to watch!  I can only hope for a season 4.
B000001FK3|5.0|very hard to  get frustrated with listening to this, I think hes one of the best songwriters  this planet has seen listening to him is relaxing
B003W77SA8|5.0|I loved this album in my youth and still do!<br />Great memories and fantastic music, just as daring and original today as it was &#34;back in the day&#34;.
B003ASLJRW|4.0|One of those rare westerns I can stomach in the vein of the rider with no name. I added it to my collection for the western lovers in the family.
B003TVMIDO|5.0|This is john lennon the way he produced them hey thats good enough for me .Sounds great and the bonus disc is a treasure.I miss john lennon alot I was 16 and waiting to purchase concert tickets when he passed.He was my hero when i was growing up and im 49 now.Great collection from a great man.God bless John Lennon.
B0024FA9IM|5.0|This is one of my go-to movies when there's nothing on regular TV and I don't what to scroll through an online streaming service. It's a relative decent take on a sci-fi television classic.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|I found this one extremely great reading.  I have recommended this particular John Grisham book to others already and will continue to do so.
B003L7DK6U|5.0|This is still one of the best martial arts movies ever made. It not only introduced America to martial arts, but set the bar for martial arts movies with a story. I think the Jim Kelly character could have been better portrayed. This is one of my go-to movies when there's nothing on regular TV and I don't what to scroll through an online streaming service.
B005OKTPKC|5.0|Great book, I loved it, found it extremely interesting and kept my inquisitive mind ticking the whole time.  I would recommend this book to others.
B004VRK3ZU|4.0|Great fun with good audio. Some scenes my be to intense for young children, especially the hunting of another human being.
B004T4KKSA|2.0|The author is really talented in making history very boring. You actually can't understand how the industry grew, the snapshots of different moments. But you can get to know a lot of small stories of some people whose names you'll forget in several days.<br /><br />If you want a tale - you can buy it, though the tail is boring.<br />If you want to know the industry - ignore this one.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|One of those rare classics. I purchased the Blu-ray version as an update to the DVD version I owned. The movie is dark and violent.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game is run when its working properly. Theirs times when I log off, then go to log back on and it want let me. It logs on in my daughter's name.doesn't make since to me because she doesn't play this game. When this happens it takes me about two days to get it to log in under my name. If I could get this problem fixed I would give it 5 stars.
B005LF9IO8|2.0|I did not like the movie or the story line as much as I thought I would. For whatever reason, I just didn't connect with this movie.
B00092ZL80|5.0|Every year for my birthday i go see EWF in Atlantic City. Was ALWAYS a fan of Chicago. To see them both together is just incredible. Two dynamic bands from the 70's and 80's. This is when music was played by real musicians. Hearing it is great but actually watching them on stage is amazing. I never knew about this concert, was poking around you tube and saw a clip and said i need this. Delivery was fast and as soon as it came in it was playing. Love it. It acutally puts a smile on my face when i watch it. It really doesnt get any better than this
B000JLPMPS|4.0|Clint and Morgan played well together. It moved a little slowly, but the acting was decent. Too bad there will not be a sequel!
B008XKSW7M|1.0|This film is boring and cheesy. To add to that, the storyline is stupid. I don't get whether this is a comedy or a drama or both. I didn't think it was funny if it was a comedy
B00164EAC8|5.0|A big step above the B-movie version. Making this Japanese product a world traveler was an interesting experiment that worked on a number of levels. I wonder what they would have done with a sequel?
B005KQVDH8|5.0|Was dissappointed that my bluray player wouldn't play my dvd but I found this on amazon for cheap and have already watched it three times.  Fantastic movie and great quality.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|It was well done but I personally did not care for it.  The scenes were great in 3D but the story did not entertain me.
B002EMESSM|5.0|SO  yesterday's greatest! Love the old gang doing their thing on the Enterprise! Vintage great film, this was so very much before it's time!  Loved it!
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|The story is full of missed opportunities and twists. It keeps you wondering what will happen. I've read it many times and never get tired of it. It is my comfort read.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|Wow.... So.... to those who buy this album - You must have life experience to really understand the depths John goes through on this one. Of course, the music is brilliant - as always to be expected from John. However, the meaning behind these songs are probably the most powerful I've ever heard - because I completely get it. It speaks to me as I was once there, where he is now, years ago. I understand exactly where he's coming from... I sure wish I could have a beer with him, I'm positive he and I could swap some stories, but even more than that, life experiences. Healing...<br /><br />The best to you, John, if you read this. You have a brother who understand you, in me. Peace.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|One of those books that kept you reading as each storyline unfolded.  That wonderful combination of intelligent writing while being an accessible read.  I read it in two days, couldn't put it down.
0316228583|5.0|This review is based on the excellent audiobook. First, my JKR background. Yes, read all HP's with my son and loved them. Thought Rowling really evolved as a writer from Book 1 to final in the series.<br /><br />Now, the main thing to know about Casual Vacancy is that, in HP, all our main characters are noble and lovable. In Casual Vacancy, it's pretty much the exact opposite. (Almost) all characters are shallow and self-serving. But they are SO brilliantly observed, you get past this. I got the sense JK had great fun writing these characters.<br /><br />The theme of the book is connectedness. The upper-class folks in Pagford are trying to distance themselves from the lower-class people in The Fields (like a U.S. housing project), and wrangling over whether to fund various social programs via the Pagford City Council such as, for instance, a rehab center.<br /><br />You MUST read (or listen to the audiobook) to the very end because that's when EVERYTHING gets tied together so beautifully, EVERY character is EXACTLY where s/he was meant to be, for better or worse. Every character has an \\"arc\\" and everything fits together like the most intricate jigsaw puzzle imaginable.<br /><br />I challenge you not be in tears at the final chapter/pages. The beginning is difficult because everything seems fragmented and dis-connected, there are lots of stories to juggle, but this is COMPLETELY by design as, again, you will see how everything fits together perfectly by the last page.<br /><br />Bottom line: I LOVED this book and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a darkly comic, dense, character study that is ultimately uplifting and hopeful!
B0015XHQTE|5.0|Anybody that was watching movies during this classic series couldn't help but love Clint Eastwood's character. This set made my day!
B003D8KH9A|4.0|Was really pleased to find I could get a paddling pool cover, and this one was reasonably priced too given that I had to buy a ground sheet too and the pool itself was not expensive . It fits reasonably well and will keep the pool clean whilst it is out in the garden.
0553801473|2.0|The book was boring and lengthy.  I had hoped it would meet the expectations I had from reading the first 3 books. The 4th book was a tough read, too.  I think we all are looking for a conclusion to the story.
B00CTKHXFO|3.0|The game metal gear solid and VR missions doesn't work if you are in a Scandinavian region. The voucher code will only work if you're in north America. There is no help at all.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My daughter and I have a lot of fun with this app!  Great app and time spent with my kids! Would suggest this game to friends and family.<br />!
B0054SMIH6|3.0|Matthew McConaughey's best work in a while.  I was very impressed with his acting here.  The story kept my interest.  Not overly realistic in how the bad guys give away their motives and announce everything they are doing.  However, the movie somehow still works and is watchable.
0064471837|5.0|I first heard of this book when I spoke to my brother in law - for whom we'd taken a punt and bought him a copy of Lirael for his birthday. Then he told us, thanks a great book, but it was the second in the series, that we needed to read the whole set, starting with Sabriel. He said he would normally find it hard to enjoy a book with a female lead character, but the book was so thoroughly engaging he didn't notice.<br /><br />I went straight out and bought the set and wasn't disappointed. Sabriel is a loveable character from the outset and incredibly strong, when my husband read them - he could also found it easy to (I forget the word that says this) put himself in her shoes.<br /><br />I can't wait to buy the set on kindle (in UK there are some legal issues being resolved - to make that possible soon). I am sure Clariel will be a book in the same league. Thank you Garth for listening to your fans, and continuing the old kingdom stories - I really hope there are more to come.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I missed season 1 and 2, and they measure up to seasons 3-5... If you like funny brainiacs...you must<br />watch it!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I like this game and it has no glitches to it. If you like Mahjong then this game is for you
1442485388|1.0|Really got suckered in by the reviews and the fact that it's getting ready to be made into a movie. Never underestimate Hollywood's willingness to push out drek for the masses.<br /><br />I made it through the first fifteen pages, but having paid $4.99 for the Kindle edition and slogged through about five more before giving it up for a lost cause.<br /><br />This might be a good read for younger folks, but is definitely not for the long time ScyFi / Fantasy reader.  I just can't face a book about very young teens placed in a plot line that would be better cast with for an older character. Fifteen year olds going out to clubs until all hours of the morning on a Sunday night, fighting demons and then nonchalantly taking a cab ride home, all with the emotional expression of a kumquat (breath). This would be more along the lines of a wealthy debutant on a mission. Give me the Dresden Files over this any day.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|If you like Bingo and slots this is a fun game! It has prizes to win to play longer and it is free!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I broke my otter box & needed a replacement.  I'm tough on my phone & need a good cover.  This one is perfect!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|This is a tournement game and a fun twist to Angry Birds! It is fun to try and beat my facebook friends
B00499NHLC|4.0|I found this program because I liked Benedict Cumberbatch in the Star Trek movie.  He plays a great Sherlock.  Season 1 was a great start to this series.  The actors and writing are brilliant, bringing Sherlock Holmes into the current time.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I loved this movie, so much so that I've seen it 11 times.  And then I decided I wanted a copy of it so I can watch it any time I want.  And I will be watching it again and again.  Depicts the south about the time I was growing up in the south, so I can relate to a lot of what the movie is about.  I don't want to tell you too many secrets about the movie, it is a MUST see!!!!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game I get high score almost every week I will continue playing it as long as it is out
0439796644|3.0|We saw the movie, it was great. Usually the book is better than the movie, In this case, just the opposite. Movie was much better.
B00A861QMM|5.0|Great game fun not boring like the other find um games I would play it again so try it you will like it to
B0063GORYU|5.0|I probably spend too much time playing this game but it's always good for a few minutes distraction while waiting for people, events, etc.
B007BVOEPI|3.0|I would have given this 2 stars except that I know that the first episode just lays the groundwork for future episodes, the quality of which I cannot assess. Still, I disliked the graphic violence and the period cliches, like the lovely white princess being married off to the barbarian king. Maybe there's something truly imaginative in later episodes but I didn't see anything like that in the first one.
B000V63C4Y|5.0|I guarantee that when most folks think of bossa nova, they're thinking of one of the songs from this classic album from American saxophonist Stan Getz and Brazilian guitarist João Gilberto (with guests).  This album is perfect for warm summer nights.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|My 5 year old daughter loves the show and she's a bit of a singer and a dancer.  After I gave it to her, she spent the next hour, in her room , singing and dancing along.
B005DF2QMC|2.0|Dissapointing.  Can't get drivers for device to work with Windows even though it says they should.  Tape player is second rate.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Too hard, after the first set of levels it becomes too hard to move on. I would like it better if you could move on faster.
B00915G6WQ|4.0|Each year has it's high and low points but year seven was great throughout the season. Can't wait for season eight
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Levels get too hard, I keep trying to get past a level but can't so lossing interest. Not a good idea.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This is NOT waterproof....it ruined my daughters IPhone 4 by allowing water to get in between the case and her phone. (and yes it was on correctly!!)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Kids love it but a little to hard for younger ones or older adults too. It does keep the amused.
B0071T5PN0|1.0|I put the CD in and listened to it several times before I wed to review it. thought something sounded familiar on a few trackes, Mikey! Then I tune into That Metal Show with Sammy and Mikey on it and it was confirmed that several tracks were old recoring never released to the public, because they were not up to their standard. Sammy joked to Mikey you have some royalties coming to which Mikey confirm the tracks were old tracks and indeed his vocals are on them.<br /><br />I want to hear the classic production values they had in the DLR era, I waited so long the hype has people not listening to the song writing, and muddy production values. Is this as good as any other VH CD yes.... VHIII....<br /><br />Case closed!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I can hardly wait for Jan. 2014 to start the next season. This is a great show that I just discovered this summer and have watched all the shows at once.
B00DW5IKJI|1.0|The marketing team of RCA (formerly Jive) brings you the newest umpteenth compilation album from the biggest corporate puppet and commercially successful fraud that's ever existed in the music industry BRITNEY SPEARS!<br /><br />While this is nothing new and just a reminder of what once was a great marketing ploy catering to the lowest common denominator it's hard to believe she's lasted 15 years let alone has had that many hits, mostly duds but within the last 5 years she's racked up more number 1's than when she worked her tail off and deserved them. All of her singles are presented with the inclusion of two meaningless tracks one of which is from her worst and most recent collaborations to date. From her humbled beginnings when she actually did use her voice to the now infamous \\"whisper singing\\" auto-tuned mess that she's affectionately adopted lately it's all here.<br /><br />For those of you who can't wait to be scammed once again hurry and order this set and be sure to pick up her other compilation albums which were released more than studio albums in the past 10 years and for those who love the abuse her new album should be out November or December. It's much easier to just fork over your money and support the machine out of habit than admitting the last 15 years were for naught and be completely devastated. It's too late and too much time and money was invested to turn your back on her and support legitimately talented artists. You never had the desire to before so why start now?
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|Wonderfully written and BRILLIANTLY acted British series featuring a growing conspiracy, clones, outrageous characters and memorable lines and scenes.  I think the best Sci Fi series on TV today.  Take that, Dr. Who!
0345803485|5.0|This book came in great condition and fast to my house.  Loving reading this series..hard to put it down or want to read to the end without having the next one ready to go.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Two of the best films ever made, on Blue Ray.  Third time was not the charm. but one and two are about as close to perfectly made as films get..Can I make it six?
1781161313|4.0|Even though this book was reprinted to coincide with the release of Prometheus, I was very happy to see this book back in print (Let's face it, nobody in their right mind is THAT willing to spend upwards of $200 for a rough copy of the first edition.) It's what you'd expect from a \\"technical manual\\" of this sort. It's loaded with pictures, diagrams, drawings, specifications, etc. For an Aliens fan, it's really a neat book to own. My only complaint about the book is that there are way too many black and white drawings/photographs, it makes the book seem less professional. Other than that, it's quite a lovely book.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|This could become addictive.  It really is a challenge.  Even my husband wants to use my Kindle now that I have this game.
B006S086AM|2.0|It was okay.  Just meh.  Didn't like Kristen Stewart in it.  Overall, I just wasn't excited about it.  Wish we would have watched something else.
