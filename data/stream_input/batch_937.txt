B002BSHXJA|5.0|As others have said, the mono box is indeed a revelation. I don't have expensive sound equipment, in fact I usually listen while driving, on the speakers my ten-year-old car came with, and yet here I am thoroughly enjoying myself. Having heard these songs, all of them, a million times in stereo, I couldn't wait to listen again in mono. I've gotten the most pleasure from Please Please Me, Help, Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper (incredible), parts of the white album and the mono masters. Day Tripper and Paperback Writer sound so fabulous. When I heard Yesterday I was particularly astonished. I turned and was surprised to find Paul NOT sitting right next to me, because it sounded like he was. This was originally recorded, what, 45 years ago? Unbelievable clarity and beauty, and it's not even my favorite song. Pepper is just a totally different experience, especially if you've heard only the '87 CD before. She's Leaving Home no longer sounds weird. Lucy no longer sounds unweird. Everything is punchier and more together. Song after song, just incredible integration of music, vocals and spirit into holistic perfection. Were some people commenting negatively on the price? To me it was worth every penny. The packaging is so cool, too. To Paul, Ringo, Yoko and Olivia: Thank You.

B002N3GD2Q|5.0|After I became a Doors fan one of the first concerts I started hearing about was the Felt Forum shows. Not only did it sound like a great name for a 60's venue, but the shows were said to be great and that you had to hear them. Until now I haven't had the opportunity, so the anticipation has been building for 30 years. Rhino Records release of these shows in their box set, The Doors Live In New York, is what fans have been looking for.<br /><br />Recorded on two nights, January 17th and 18th 1970. The Doors did four shows and each show is included in its entirety in this box set. Some of the songs have been included on other Doors live albums. You'll hear When The Music's Over that was on Absolutely Live, but just when you think you know the song, you realize there's more. The Absolutely Live version was edited. For The Doors fan searching for something new, each CD contains a veritable plethora of previously unreleased versions of songs. It's good to hear the songs in context with all the strengths and shortcomings The Doors had as a band. These recordings give the listener the full sense and feeling of the concert experience - the false starts, the band tuning up, Jim asking the audience what they want to hear, or the silences as the band consults amongst themselves what they want to play next. Jim Morrison seems to excise one of his demons, his ongoing struggle with lightmen. His, \\"Hey, Mr. light man!\\" rap that he did at many shows chiding the lightmen who never seem to do what he wants, seems to resolve itself as he compliments the lighting level at the show! The Doors were never a band to play the album version of songs, Morrison tinkers with the words of songs as well. This was before concerts became slick clones of each other, where the same thing happens at the same time in the concert, identical, from concert to concert, city to city. The Doors were stark theatre, a portrayal of reality through the songs like a novel is a portrayal through words, or a movie through film.<br /><br />The band opens each show with a couple of songs from Morrison Hotel. It's cool to realize that as you're listening to Roadhouse Blues or Peace Frog the audience is very likely hearing the songs for the very first time. It opens you up to that experience. The Doors also experimented with the songs. Who Do You Love was played at every show yet no two versions of the song are alike! Curiously, Peace Frog, easily one of Morrison's most autobiographical songs, because of the Dawn's Highway section, where Morrison recounts the mystical experience he had as a child of feeling as if the soul of an Indian had leaped into his, as performed at the Felt Forum most of the versions omit that part, only in the last show does he include that portion of the song.<br /><br />The last disc is a powerhouse of a encore with John Sebastian and Dallas Taylor sitting in. They play a bluesier version of Maggie McGill than is on Morrison Hotel, and this version fit's the song and works much better as a straight forward blues song<br /><br />The sound on the CDs is excellent. Bruce Botnik in a technical note says in parts that were missing from the 8-track master they inserted live 2-track and the sound might change in those parts, but I didn't hear it. I listened to the CDs on a car CD player and in my computer. I didn't hear any change of quality, in fact it seemed crystal clear. In one section you can clearly hear the maraca Morrison shakes.<br /><br />The boxed set includes a beautiful 40 page booklet with an introduction by Jac Holzman, and Bruce Botnik provides background details about The Doors playing the Felt Forum. James Henke a VP the Rock \\"n' Roll Hall of Fame and author of The Jim Morrison Scrapbook has also written an essay for the book. The book also includes about 15 high gloss photographs from the shows.<br /><br />This is one of the last full blown tours of The Doors career. The next year would find the band finishing L.A. Woman, and Morrison planning his imminent departure to Paris. These shows are The Doors as they wanted be heard, in context and demonstrating the power of what a great rock band can be.<br /><br />Jim writes The Doors Examiner.s are The Doors as they wanted be heard, in context and demonstrating the power of what a great rock band can be.

0061914177|3.0|UPDATE: I forget to mention that I do like Gary's wine show and he is personable, I'm mainly disappointed because he's exactly the guy to approach this topic and completely own it - and I hope he does in the next edition! As for wine knowledge and inspiration, you'll never beat him.<br /><br />--<br /><br />I seem to have read a spate of books like this recently: a 2 page concept crammed into 142 pages. Beyond the extensive biography of the author and his enthusiasm for social media, the basic concept is a technological rehash of \\"do what you love\\" and doesn't really go much beyond that.<br /><br />To say it's light on the 'how' is like calling a drowning victim 'wet'. If you're looking for a guide to using social media to improve your business or brand, instead check out Tara Hunt's Whuffie book since there's next to nothing in here. Whereas 'Whuffie' examines businesses and makes logical conclusions about social media and its value to the bottom line, this reads like a self-help infomercial with next to zero substance.<br /><br />The basic problem is that it's easy to build a web presence when you're famous and/or already successful - and there's a natural limit to how many people can hold our attention on the web. Most of the ideas he has wouldn't work for the average Joe (who wants to watch my YouTube channel to hear me?). I suspect most people really don't need to be told to 'follow their passion'. And while Gary's a nice guy, the self promotion om the book doesn't deliver on its goal.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|I only gave the original 'Let It Be' three stars. It had some good songs, but in truth it was a pretty ramshackle and unpolished effort. I understand that the band wanted to make a more straightforward rock album, but too often \\"back to basics\\" seemed to mean \\"ragged and unfinished\\". The inclusion of errors, false starts, bum notes, silly studio patter and so on gave some songs a very unprofessional feel, particularly since The Beatles were perfectionists in nearly every other album they made.    In contrast, what stands out so much on 'Naked' is the professionalism. The songs have been re-mixed to edit out the errors, John Lennon's silly comments have been removed, and subtle uses of production are employed to flesh out and polish the songs.  Sometimes a completely different take has been used, or even a combination of several takes, to get the best possible recorded version of a song.    The track listing and running order has been changed as well. Adding the excellent 'Don't Let Me Down' (why was it left off the original???) and losing 'Dig It' and 'Maggie Mae' earns the album an extra star alone. I also think the new track sequence is better; 'Get Back' is a far more purposeful opener than the laid-back 'Two Of Us', and the title track provides a suitably stately and poignant closer.    Most importantly, 'Naked' removes the Wall Of Sound overdubs from 'The Long And Winding Road', 'Across the Universe' and 'I Me Mine'. All three sound much better in the more stripped-back format; obviously 'The Long And Winding Road' is a huge improvement, but 'Across The Universe' too finally gets to show what a beautiful song it really is, compared to the overly-mystical beast it was on the original album.     So 'Naked' is a vast improvement; a really polished and professional piece of work, that tidies up all the loose ends and rough edges of the original. In doing so, it finally allows 'Let It Be' (decades after the fact) to take its place among the other classics in The Beatles' catalogue.     Five stars.
B002M2T1UO|3.0|Been watching the price of The Shield: The Complete Series Collection. Preordered from Amazon and couldn't wait to get this set.  Very nice looking book that holds all 29 DVDs. The DVDs are sandwiched between the cardboard pages. Spots of adhesive got between these page and the DVDs were slipped in and the adhesive scratches the DVDs when taking them out or putting them in. Also some adhesive sticks to the DVD which makes it very hard to get out. You have to pick the adhesive off about half the DVDs. Very poor quality on Sony's part. The book looks very nice but being 7 ½\\" X 12\\" it dose not store with any of my other Series. Would look nice on the coffee table but not where I want to keep my DVDs. Amazon has been great, they are sending me another set. Amazon don't think the Glue will be a problem in them all, we will see. Today you can buy The Complete Series Collection for $107, buy the Season 1 thru 7 buy them selfs and it cost $235. Hope they fix the problem.

B002HWRYJE|3.0|This movie special-effects you to death.  Perhaps I've become jaded by movie technology, but I am weary of films that seem to exist solely to show the abilities of the computer graphics department.  The Star Trek TV series and many of the films worked because of characterzations, not special effects.  For example, the design of the alien Romulan ship made no logical sense.    I've also wearied of the grossly overused time travel plot line.  By now, it's become a cliché.    The characters were stereotyped and overblown - Kirk especially - and Scottie was a virtual caricature.  As to being true to the Star Trek story line . . . well, let's just say there were some disappointing aspects.    WARNING!  SPOILER ALERT!!    1. Checkov did not join the original series until the second season and therefore would not have been on the maiden voyage.  And why would a seventeen-year-old receive such responsibility?  How did he get into Starfleet Academy at such a young age, much less graduate by age seventeen?    2. A romance between Spock and Uhura?  Please!  It destroys Spock's basic character and was never so much as hinted at in any other installment.  His embracing of emotion later in life is logical but not earlier.  The conflict of logic versus emotion is one thing, but losing his cool and attacking Kirk is out of character for Spock.    3. Vulcan destroyed?  Spock's mother dead?  How is that possible?  What was the planet Vulcan in all the subsequent (chronologically speaking) episodes?  How did his mother appear later in time?  Or will there be a sequel that puts everything back to the way it was?  Or is.  Or should be.  Whatever.    4. This film's Enterprise interiors looked nothing like the original sets, which does, after all, form the basis of the ship's design.    5. The story of Christopher Pike as told originally in the two-part presentation using the original pilot (with Jeffrey Hunter as Pike) was completely ignored.  Are we to assume Pike encountered the mind-controlling aliens before this story and subsequently was disfigured?  Remember that Spock was part of his crew then.    6. Why would Starfleet hand the captaincy of the fleet's star ship (pun intended) to an inexperienced rule-breaker like Kirk?  Doesn't pass the logic test.  And in The Wrath of Kahn, Bones states that Kirk received recognition for reprogramming the Kobyashi Maru scenario.  This movie has him nearly drummed out of the Academy for it.    7. Nimoy's appearance as an elderly Spock made no sense in the movie.    The movie kept my attention and is well constructed, but it failed to satisfy me.  Believability has been a hallmark of Star Trek but not this film.
0691142165|5.0|Every so often, experts sucker people into bidding up the prices of stocks or real estate because they announce that the economy has fundamentally changed. As the aftermath of the real estate bubble illustrates, the basics of economics don't really change, no matter what fantasies people come to believe. Economics professors Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff present a thorough historical and statistical tour of financial hubris through the centuries, a postmortem that will make you wonder how anyone ever believed \\"this time is different.\\" The staid tone, formulas, charts and somewhat confusing organization make this fascinating history challenging to absorb.

B001437DMA|5.0|Just as the rooster crows and the wolf howls, so does Joe Satriani play his guitar at inhuman levels - Satch continues his trend with his 2008 album 'Professor Satchafunkilus and the Musterion of Rock.' I really like this album - 'Professor Satchafunkilus and the Musterion of Rock' is definitely another fantastic Joe Satriani album.<br /><br />When I first popped the 'Professor Satchafunkilus and the Musterion of Rock' CD in my car CD player, I was hit with a revived 80s sounding Satriani with the first tune on the album, \\"Musterion.\\" With a style reminiscent of Satch's first album 'Not Of This Earth' combined with the dreamy feeling of one of his best songs, \\"Flying In A Blue Dream,\\" \\"Musterion\\" is a great song and the perfect way to start the album. \\"Overdriver\\" follows, a high flying spacious groove that I predict will be a live Joe Satriani staple in the future. Joe switches gears with the fun rock tune \\"I Just Wana Rock\\" and the messy jam \\"Professor Satchafunkilus.\\"<br /><br />Then comes \\"Revelation,\\" the crown jewel in the album and Joe Satriani's best song since - well, 2 years ago with \\"A Cool New Way\\" but you get my point! A tender powerhouse, this song both rocks the house down and takes you on an emotional odyssey with warm tones, a Satch solo filled with power, and melodies that hit me deep - what a tune. From \\"Revelation\\" on, this second half of the album is even better than the first. \\"Come On Baby\\" is a smooth guitar ballad and \\"Out Of The Sunshine\\" is one of the best songs on the album - a cheerful & moving groove with a Satriani-style island groove interjected in the middle of the song. \\"Diddle-Y-A-Doo-Dat\\" showcases another great Joe Satriani boogie-like guitar tune of \\"Satch Boogie\\" proportions; the epic iceberg of a tune \\"Asik Vaysel\\" is a great addition to the album (and a great driving song I might add); and the album finishes with \\"Andalusia,\\" a real good tune with a world-music start and a traditional Joe Satriani jam end.<br /><br />Well done Joe and thanks again for another wonderful album!n for another wonderful album!
B002QEXN2K|3.0|Picking up where his 2006 breakthrough \\"Continuum\\" left, John Mayer's \\"Battle Studies\\" again bring simple, straighforward and ultimately profound songs, classic hooks, above-average arrangements and everyman attitude. Indeed, he is not an aloof, sophisticated artist, his albums rather present him as a great songwriter (one of the best of the 2000's), good guitar-player (check out the closer \\"Friends, Lovers or Nothing\\") and solid singer.    High-quality songcraft abounds mainly in the first half of the album, with neat balladry of \\"All We Ever Do Is Say Goodbye\\", Tom Petty-ish \\"Half of My Heart \\" featuring Taylor Swift and breezy lead single \\"Who Says\\". Also interesting are the caleidoscopic guitars in \\"Assassin\\", wah-wah solo guitar in \\"Crossroads\\" and \\"Edge of Desire\\" with its disarming chorus melody and sprawling fadeout. In fact, despite the lots of joys audible already at first listen, the album is a kind of grower, too, for example in the Knopflerian \\"War Of My Life\\"    Given the fact that after \\"Continuum\\" John Mayer became a real celebrity also on pages of tabloids, this album is surprisingly similar to its predecessor. This is not a bad thing, only it shows that John Mayer is reasonably content with the current state of his art affairs. And maybe that he does not mind the paparazzi too much. The overall playing-it-safe, comfortable approach to the album may not bring John much closer to halls of fame, the real quality of \\"Battle Studies\\", however, will not go unnoticed. Still, next time we will be waiting for something special.

1400076943|2.0|This book was a bit of a disappointment storywise.  It was very slow to get going.  What was up with the father?  Did he have a psychological disease?  Why did he have such little empathy for his family?  Was it supposed to be because he was so stressed out by the evil government that he had to take it out on the powerless people who loved him?  The father was a monster who was equally as bad as the vile government.  Does he represent a typical Igbo man with power?  The angelic priest was not an Igbo, was he?  The ending was bad.  Did the son or the mother do it?  Either one doing it makes them equally as bad as the father.  The author couldnt make up her mind.  The son must have done it, cause the premise of the book is that Igbo men with power are evil.   Nice that the evil government allows the 3 of them to inherit all of Bad Daddy's money to squander as they wish and live happily ever after without Bad Daddy around.

The plot was barely there and the lines were so sophmoric, I was saying them along with the movie without ever having seen it before.

I suppose if you just want flashy lights and BFG's, this might entertain you for a moment or two, but honestly, there are a lot better in that genre.
039472903X|4.0|Of course, David Ogilvy is one of the all-time great advertising execs and copywriters.  This is a useful book for anyone who wants to learn more about marketing, copywriting, advertising, or sales letters.<br /><br />I liked this book because it shared a lot of interesting stories from his life and work, and despite being written over 20 years ago still has lots of timeless information and tips.  He writes in an old-fashioned, patrician style that reflects his upbringing and day and age.  Although it took a little while to get used to, it's actually quite refreshing.<br /><br />The rigor that Ogilvy applied to his research and copywriting should be applied in all marketing projects, whether online or offline.  With the key concepts of this book, you can dramatically improve the marketing performance of your existing website or advertising project.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|I'm a long time Sandra Bullock fan and expected Ryan Reynolds to pale beside her.  Surprisingly, this wasn't the case.  Ryan reminds me of Meryl Streep in that he can effectively convey feelings, thoughts and emotions with subtle facial shifts.  This film also was a pleasant surprise for a male viewer in that Ryan was the emotionally available half of the duo.  Don't know about the rest of you but I'm tired of seeing images of feckless males in movies and The Proposal was a breath of fresh air in this regard.  I found the pairing of a younger man with an obviously older woman a delightful twist because the movie showed them both getting past age issues and finding each other's underlying qualities and beautiful hearts.  The reason I didn't give it five stars is that the script is a bit too formulaic.  With a bit more imagination in the screen writing this would merit five stars.

B002QEXN2K|4.0|John Mayer set the bar too high on the last album and falls short of his high standard on this one.  A lot of his songs are good, but there's nothing here that has the punch of Continuum, which I believe is his finest work and an absolute masterpiece.  On Continuum, he shows how fantastic his guitar skills are and brings his blues influence out in full force.  On Battle Studies, he sinks backwards towards some of his older, less sophisticated works.  After several listens, this album has grown on me, but it's only enjoyable, not fantastic.

B002NPUCP8|5.0|Yeah, so...seriously, what's not to like? The girl can sing, play the guitar, play the bass. Most of all, she can put it all together well.     Yeah, look, some if not most of the songs may seem too 'pop' for some ppl, but we just have to put the musician's intent in mind when reviewing. pop may be her focus in this album, but as she has said, there is something for everyone. namely, an instrumental track, a bluesy track, some ballad tracks, etc. she wanted to appeal to a wider audience in her sophomore album, is that so bad? that doesn't means she won't go in a narrower direction next time. if she does, then great, that shows her versatility. if she doesn't, then maybe she found a way to improve on her 'pop' songs. but in any event, this album is very well done and is very much in keeping with what she was trying to accomplish. so yes, thumbs up for me!

B0017JKEL8|5.0|Mad Men is one of those rare shows that just stands up and slaps you in the face. The sets are amazing. The costuming is very well done. The dialogue and character interaction is stunning. You are always left wanting for more. The show is damn near perfect.<br /><br />The blu-ray experience just enhances the viewing. The only draw back to watching on blu-ray vs. regular old school dvd would be the load time. These do take a few extra minutes over other blu-rays to load. Well worth the wait for this end product though.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|A joyous movie that has a tenderly unexpected start.  The movie moves in its own direction with confidence and persuasiveness.  The story floats along (yes, a pun)with in your face humor and a quirky melancholy, lighting coated.  The movie perfectly balances modern computer graphics with sentimental decour/themes from the 1950s and prior.  Screentime nicely balanced between the two main protangonists, their animal co-padres, and the icon turned villain. Disney did a fine job undermarketing the movie and letting the mystery of the unconventional story unravel itself secretly before contented audience.  One of the year's best.
B0002EQ7E2|5.0|This has been my favorite album for my entire life. It is an exquisite musical production with fantastic sound quality to boot. I'm an audiophile and this is a go-to reference for me. In fact, I recommend the entire remastered Paul Simon collection. They're all well-produced as far as sound quality goes although in terms of both content and quality this one tops the charts.

0385504225|1.0|So...after 2 other completely other out of the realm of normal experiences, Robert Landon still can't believe that there is some mysterious secret being protected by an age old secret society?  Really Robert?    While there is some interesting information in this book about Freemasonry and historic symbolism, the writing itself is formulaic and unnecessarily over-dramatic.  Every other chapter ends with someone's terrifying interior revelation spelled out for you in italics.  Each piece of new information is started in one chapter, then not revealed until the next.    While I don't expect these types of books to be high-brow literature, a little finesse would not hurt and a few less cheesy \\"revelations\\" would certainly help.    And as for the most horrible secret video that if revealed would be a threat to the security of the entire world - are you kidding me?  After reading about all of the ridiculous things that public figures do every day and more or less get away with, as well as knowing what goes on in every fraternity / sorority initiation in the country, does anyone really believe that seeing our politicians enacting some silly old rituals would create chaos in the world?    Lame.
B002K0WBXW|1.0|I've seen Ryan Reynolds in movies in which he was charming and funny. He was great as the comic relief in the 3rd or 4th Blade movie, as an example, and Sandra Bullock can pull off a certain kind of role as well. She used to bring a fresh, sassy forthright appeal of her own, but in this film neither of them brings any of their strengths. Bullock looks pinched throughout and not like she's \\"in character,\\" but as though she's wondering how the heck she ended up in this train wreck, and all of Reynolds' comedic gifts seem to be stifled. It felt like they both were acting with restraint. Not sure where that came from? Maybe the writing, which wasn't great, or the directing, but wherever it originated, it really held the movie back. I also found the movie's premise unlikely at best and the idea that one is going to do NYC to Sitka, Alaska and back in a weekend to be preposterous. But the real problem was that the characters did not behave believably in the end. What comes before needs to build to a believable resolution, and the idea that one highly stressful weekend together was going to cause these two characters to fall in love was beyond absurd. Each step of the way you could see how it wasn't adding up more and more that they should be together at all. There just was no reason presented for why they would suddenly turn their feelings around. I'd compare this movie to one Bullock did a few years ago called \\"While You Were Sleeping.\\" In it she was engaged to one man while secretly falling in love with his brother and each step of the way you could see how and why she belonged with him rather then with the man she was engaged to. There was none of that slow build happening here at all, so when the ending came you weren't happily satisfied that all turned out as it should, but rather jarred and left thinking this is ridiculous because there's no way these two belong together. And sadly, we saw Bullock do the \\"I can't marry him under these circumstances\\" thing far betterin \\"While You Were Sleeping.\\" Did no one realize she'd done the exact same scene before in that movie? Clearly there are a great many people who love Bullock no matter what and apparently rom-com no matter how bad, and more power to them, but this movie was painful to watch in my view and a complete waste of time.

0316069906|1.0|This book is full of untruths. How about some true facts about animal agriculture from a third generation dairy farmer:<br /><br />Agriculture's carbon footprint: Agriculture is responsible for 6% of the greenhouse gas produced in the U.S. Water vapor is the #1 greenhouse gas attributing about 65% of greenhouse gas in the U.S. Source: Illinois Ag Extension 2008<br /><br />Antibiotics: Dairy cattle are never feed antibiotics. If a cow is sick and requires treatment, it is placed in the \\"hospital pen\\" and treated. During this treatment, the milk from that cow must be discarded. Every single tank load of milk produced in the U.S. is tested for antibiotics and if trace amounts are found, that entire tank of milk is dumped and never processed for human consumption. If dairymen feed antibiotics to their animals, they wouldn't be able to sell milk from their farm.<br /><br />Cattle nutrition: Dairymen work with a nutritionist to formulate a balanced ration for their cattle. A common ration would include corn, soybean meal, grain, hay, cottonseed, almond hulls, citrus pulp and other ingredients depending on what part of the country you live in. Cattle always have free-choice, fresh water available.<br /><br />Housing: Modern farms house animals in clean, comfortable, temperature controlled barns. Modern barns have lots of natural light, good air-flow and are bedded with fresh materials such as sand or sawdust. There is much research available about constructing barns for optimal animal comfort. The goal is providing a comfortable environment for the animals.<br /><br />Manure: Animals produce manure and there are lots of rules about how this manure must be stored, handled and land-applied. Manure lagoons must be designed by professional engineers to meet specs that are put in place to insure against groundwater pollution. Manure is a great natural fertilizer and is land-applied following guidelines to make sure no runoff pollutes waterways.<br /><br />Farmers and dairymen are the original environmentalists, conservationists and animal welfare advocates. We care about our land, animals and sustainability. To us, these ideas are not passing trends or the \\"causes of the moment\\". They represent the principles people in agriculture have followed to operate their businesses for generations.<br /><br />If you want to learn the reality of animal agriculture, talk with a farmer or visit a farm.re the original environmentalists, conservationists and animal welfare advocates.

B000VPPMXO|3.0|I have used two of these that came with my Roomba 500 series for slightly over a year. Both the virtual wall and lighthouse features worked well. I agree that it should plug into AC power. I think C sized batteries would be better than the D cells that it uses.<br /><br />If I were only rating this item alone I would give it 4-5 stars. Unfortunately, I had to return the item because my 500 series Roomba failed just after the 1-year warranty. I had a 400 series that failed just after warranty due to the \\"circle dance\\". My 500 series failed because the two main brushes stopped turning with light use and thus it stopped cleaning. From what I have read this was due to a problem of an unsealed gear box with plastic gears. It seems hair would get in and cause the gear box to fail. It seems that the gear box has been re-designed but I do not think that there is any way to know which gear box one is getting when buying the product.<br /><br />I find that iRobot makes a poorly designed product with very poor customer support. I do not see how they are staying in business. I think the only option to use this product would be with a lifetime warranty.
B001AVCFK6|4.0|The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />\\"Star Trek (2009)\\" is presented in a 1080p 2.40:1 aspect ratio Blu-Ray. Video quality is terrific. A very light film grain is present which is quite accurate compared to the theatrical presentation. Black levels are inky and deep, colors are vivid but still accurate. Close-ups demonstrate a lot of detail, especially facial close-ups. Space scenes are also swimming with detail, since most every space ship in this film is in various numbers of pieces or states of damage. Noticeable edge-enhancement and digital noise reduction are non-existent.<br /><br />Simply put, this is five star material all the way. Anyone who enjoys action/sci-fi eye candy for their HD setup would do well to purchase this disc. It is demo-worthy material. This may be the single best Blu-Ray I have seen - it at least ties in visual quality with the excellent Braveheart and Frost/Nixon discs.<br /><br />Sound is presented in a well-balanced Dolby TrueHD mix, which is notable for not only its punch and vibrancy, but also the fact that it never drowns out dialogue. This is something that many action movies fail to accomplish, and it is most appreciated, at least by this viewer. I HATE it when I have to constantly adjust the volume on the fly in order to hear whispers of dialogue, only to have my speakers threaten to blow out when some sudden burst of noisy action occurs. \\"Star Trek (2009)\\" is wonderfully well-done in this respect. Surround channels get a lot of work, bass is booming at appropriate moments, so just like the video, audio is stellar. Also included are commentaries with Director and writers (no, they do not apologize for various inconsistencies and mistakes) and some foreign language tracks. The subtitles are a little odd - sometimes they fail to transcribe dialogue. 95% of the stuff is there, but there are clearly things missing - Kirk says \\"wow\\" upon seeing the Enterprise, and it is nowhere to be found in the subtitle track. Not a deal-breaker, just weird.<br /><br />Extras are copious and presented in HD, which is great. However, this disc suffers from a recent trend in home video extras - they are split into 30 separate chunks, presumably to look better on box copy. So you are forced to navigate a menu with 30 choices, with no markers for what you've already seen, in order to see all of the features. This is too bad, because the features are really, really good. If they had been spliced into one 2-hour making of feature, one set of deleted scenes, and one gag reel, this would be just about the perfect set of extras. Instead, you are made to do \\"work\\" instead of just enjoying the \\"fun.\\" The deleted scenes, by the way, are also in HD, and most would have made the movie better. They should have just finished the effects and incorporated them into the film proper.<br /><br />The Movie:<br /><br />In the special features, the producers and director make it very clear that their guiding question when making the film was \\"Can we make it cool?\\" Well, they've succeeded at making it \\"cool.\\" Unfortunately in making this their emphasis, they have also made some severe missteps that make it difficult to swallow as a serious Trek fan.<br /><br />So I'll review this movie wearing two hats. First, for \\"the rest of you:\\"<br /><br />\\"Star Trek (2009)\\" offers a bold re-imagining of a venerable television science fiction franchise. To a certain extent, it sheds much of the baggage accumulated over 40 years of television and films, giving non-Trekkies an easy entree into the universe.<br /><br />We are given the tale of Kirk, Spock and McCoy taking the reins of the Starship Enterprise, in a galaxy populated by both humans and other races. James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is a brash young man who is set adrift by the attack of a Romulan villain upon the ship carrying his parents. Without the influence of his father, a Starfleet officer, Kirk has an aimless childhood, squandering his intellect and his drive on bar brawls and car thefts. Luckily, he is intercepted by the wise, gruff Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) and challenged to make a better life for himself and to live up to his ability by joining Starfleet.<br /><br />There, he meets fellow cadets Uhura (Zoe Saldana), McCoy (Karl Urban), Chekov (Anton Yelchin), Sulu (John Cho), and an irritating instructor, the cool, logical Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto). Their contrasting styles immediately put them at odds with each other. Spock has grown up the child of two worlds, with a human mother, and a father from Vulcan, a planet whose culture has embraced logic and the shedding of emotion, except perhaps the emotion of racism against humans.<br /><br />Before their education is complete, they are presented with the threat of the same villain who had killed Kirk's dad 25 years prior - Nero (Eric Bana). Turns out Nero is from the future, and is bent on revenge for the destruction of his home world, Romulus. In a plot development somewhat like \\"Space Camp,\\" for some unstated reason, every other ship is somewhere else, and there are no trained crew members available for the newly-built Enterprise. So the cadets are drafted into service right then and there.<br /><br />Various plot twists and turns see Kirk marooned on an ice planet, where he meets not only Scotty (a very funny Simon Pegg) but also a much older Spock (Leonard Nimoy). This old Spock explains that the visitor from the future has changed history, and that Kirk must team up with the younger Spock, melding their disparate styles and talents into a team that can defeat the threat.<br /><br />Overall, the plot moves very quickly, and might be a bit confusing to those not versed in Trek lore. But the speed, noise, and bombast are such that pausing to consider holes in story logic (and there are quite a few) is not really feasible until after the movie has finished. The effects, music, and performances are all flashy and dazzling, and it is hard not to feel aggressively entertained by the whole spectacle. Especially charming are Pine as Kirk and Quinto as Spock. Their chemistry works well. There were really no casting problems for the heroes. The villain, Nero, is somewhat less successful, as his motivations are rather obscure, especially to an audience not familiar with Romulans, time travel, and the like.<br /><br />It is all done with ample brio and verve - enough panache to surmount its sometimes lazy storytelling and slipshod logic. On a scale of ten, I'd give it a solid 7, perhaps even an 8. It is much more entertaining than the average Hollywood popcorn movie, mainly on the strength of the characters and the performances.<br /><br />Now, for the Trekkies:<br /><br />\\"Star Trek (2009)\\" is the product of Hollywood corporate committees, shedding \\"baggage\\" in such a way that it dilutes some of the core concepts and appeal of the show which gave rise to the Trekkie faithful in the first place.<br /><br />The characters from the original series are brought together in a way which feels quite far from organic, presumably because Hollywood executives were worried that a slower tale that realistically developed their relationships would fail to satisfy audiences unused to thinking and realism. Instead of being members of a logically coherent military organization, each with careers and internal lives of their own, all of our principal characters are roughly the same age and have the same amount of experience, despite the fact that by the end of the film, they all have different ranks and specialties. Especially galling at the end is the instantaneous promotion of Kirk from 25-year-old Starfleet cadet (not even a graduate, as he is in his third year of studies) directly to Captain of the fleet's newest and most advanced flagship. It would be akin to a fresh West Point graduate being given command of the invasion of Afghanistan, or an Annapolis cadet being given command of an aircraft carrier. Why would anyone who had invested a lifetime in this organization respect any order that escapes his lips? Equally puzzling are the promotions of all the other crew members at the end as well - why is Kirk a Captain, but McCoy a Commander, Uhura a Lieutenant, Chekov an Ensign? They all have the same amount of experience and \\"seasoning\\" (i.e. none).<br /><br />This is the sort of world-breaking contrivance that litters the film (want some more examples? \\"Transwarp Beaming\\" immediately springs to mind...). Which is too bad, because \\"Star Trek (2009)\\" ably captures the feel of the previous shows, mixing humor, fisticuffs, and dazzling gadgetry in nearly the perfect proportions. It fails, however, to add the integral piece - a logically consistent world, one that creates and follows its own rules, one that is similar enough to our own to be comprehensible, but different and better enough that it inspires admiration and wonder, and makes you yearn to live in it. It is a bit of a tragedy, since just a few tweaks and edits could have turned a story full of world-breaking holes and missteps into pretty much the best Trek movie ever.<br /><br />The quality of special effects is above that of the other films and series, and will definitely impress Trek veterans who are used to less. Many in-jokes and subtler references abound, and will no doubt elicit smiles and chuckles from those who are \\"in the know.\\"<br /><br />But that certain something is missing. That special thing which makes something \\"Trek,\\" and not just \\"Generic Space Opera #12.\\" There isn't much \\"Real\\" science fiction, for one thing - black holes and space ships could have been substituted with quicksand and stage coaches - they are not concepts that drive the plot or the characters or the world, instead they are generic perils, and devices to surmount those dangers. But heck, that could be said of some of the other films, those films that, despite their failings, we would still call \\"real\\" Trek. What is missing is the logical consistency of the world. Continuity. \\"Baggage.\\" In stripping \\"Star Trek (2009)\\" down to something that will appeal to a \\"mass\\" audience, the producers of this film have denatured it into something reminiscent, but not recognizable.<br /><br />In summary:<br /><br />This is an entertaining film, no doubt about it. If you are not a Trekkie, you will probably love it. You should buy it. It's a terrific disc to give your home theater a workout.<br /><br />If you are a Trekkie, you may have mixed feelings. I do.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|Installing the Ear Force X41 Digital RF Wireless Gameing Headphones was quick and easy. The quality is great and works great with the XBOX 360. If I walk more than 15 feet away or around a corner then there is some crackling and disruption in the sound and the sound cuts out a bit, but overall they're great. I live in an apartment buliding and these are the perfect solution to multi-unit living. I've actually passed the info along to my landlord in case they ever have issues with anyone listening to music, watching movies or gaming that have the volume too high for their neighbors. Definitely a good buy.
B001992NUQ|5.0|The movie: I love Fight Club. It's one of the best American films of the past 20 years. Literate, funny, disturbing, shocking, and endlessly entertaining, it's really without flaw. Thank goodness it got made before 2001, after which a film that lionizes the exploits of a domestic terrorist who plots to destroy buildings could probably have never been made.<br /><br />The performances are all quite good - Edward Norton before he started believing his own press, Brad Pitt, well, being Brad Pitt very well, and Helena Bonham Carter in the perfectly cast role (if not typecast at this point) are the highlights.<br /><br />I'm not going to say much else. If, somehow, you've avoided seeing this movie, I would hate to spoil it for you. It's a must see, plain and simple, up there with the films of Kubrick, Scorsese, and other American cinematic luminaries of the past 50 years.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />Wow. I was cringing, hoping and praying to the Blu-Ray gods that this one wouldn't be ruined as other films of this vintage have, (such as Gladiator) by a terrible, disrespectful video transfer, loaded with edge enhancement, excessive DNR, and the like.<br /><br />Well, my prayers were answered. A fine, lovely film grain is preserved in this 2.40:1 1080p encode. Detail is very strong, especially in cloth textures. This is a DARK movie, and the blackness is well represented, with deep, rock solid blacks. Shadow detail is great, though, with loads of information present in the shadowy near-black parts of the picture. BE SURE TO CALIBRATE your TV before watching this! You must have your brightness, contrast, and gamma set properly to get the most out of this flick. The color palette of the film, with its sickly greens and browns, and its omnipresent fluorescent lighting, is well-preserved.<br /><br />Fight Club was an early DVD which was very good for its day. This Blu-Ray takes that DVD, smashes it teeth out, rubs its face in the dirt, and urinates on its corpse. The quality of this transfer is close to or equal to that of the best current films today. It really is stunning.<br /><br />Audio is presented in a 5.1 channel DTS-HD soundtrack that works perfectly fine. Much of the film is dialogue heavy, but when the surrounds get churning, they sound great, and do not obscure the dialogue. This is really the main thing I want out of a soundtrack - to not have to constantly adjust the volume while watching the movie. Fight Club succeeds.<br /><br />Extras include 4 commentaries, with everyone from the director to the stars to the author of the original book having a say. The making of and retrospective features are a mix of old and new. I can't tell if all of the extras from the previous disc are present, but at least some of them are. The new stuff is in HD, the old stuff in SD. I must say, the organization of the extras is not great. The menus are a tad confusing, and a lot of small things are hidden in small corners. Most irritating is \\"Jack's search index,\\" which mixes clips of the film itself with other more fleshed out features in a giant alphabetical list. Not very useful, given the need to remember what you've selected before.<br /><br />In summary:<br /><br />This disc is a worthy upgrade. It houses a great video transfer, and at least as much extra material as the original 2 disc DVD, all on one Blu-Ray disc. At the price it's currently going for, it's a steal.<br /><br />Even if some of the extra features are missing from the DVD (which I have not taken the time to confirm due to the irritating menu system), there really is no reason to hang onto your old set.

B0000524CY|5.0|This movie is deservedly a classic, but to me it's one of the great comedies of all time.  I saw it in the theater when it was released, since on TV.  I first saw it with 2 Catholic close friends.  They were terrified.  But when Linda Blair's head started spinning around, I just could not stop laughing.  They looked at me and wondered, \\"What's wrong with him?\\"  There are films I find really scary, most of which my wife is too afraid to watch (Hitchcock's Psycho, Jaws, Halloween, Alien), but The Exorcist always makes me laugh.
B002M2T1UO|1.0|I only give this set one star because of the way it was packaged.     If it was just about the quality of the series and the episodes themselves I'd give it 5 stars.    The set is packaged in a coffee table book type case that, while great looking, is not practical for holding DVD disks. The DVDs have to be slipped in and out of a very tight space in between two sheets of cardboard. Almost every disk in this set had small scratches on them and some had huge gashes in them. A few were unplayable. There were also small particles of glue on the disks that came off of the cardboard book packaging.

B002B9TRHK|4.0|Note:<br /><br />This review endorses this album to the fullest extent, but airs concerns about a particular edition, the new SHM-CD version currently listed on amazon for 4 times the price of the normal cd.<br /><br />Unfortunately I could not find a way to make this review appear only on the edition in question.  Apologies for any confusion or inconvenience you may experience from reading this review.  In any edition this is a great album.  I still wish I could see reviews of the different editions listed separately.<br /><br />Besides a former life as a radio DJ and 20 years as a professional musician who has played with many greats and not so greats, besides my various musicologist, musician, producer and audiophile friends, and putting aside my ridiculous collection of about 5000 albums of all genres, I preface my review with the simple qualification that if you are a human being with working ears and a heart, this album is certainly one of the best you could ever own, and you have all you need to appreciate it.<br /><br />The songwriting is without equal, the delivery is of the utmost integrity and feeling, the players are the best, exquisitely arranged and performed, and while not as lush as the few almost as amazing albums that followed it, as a collection of great songs well played it is one of the greatest masterpieces in the history of recorded music.<br /><br />However, one big issue with this product as seen on this amazon page:  no one is reviewing this specific and expensive reissue.  I wish I could, but I haven't heard it.  I can tell you this album is one that will not disappoint no matter the medium, but if we are to pay 2-4 times what the cd would normally cost in order to get special plastic that supposedly plays better in our cd players, we need to know what the difference is.<br /><br />Please, anyone who has heard this edition, please let us know if you can hear any improvement or any difference in this new and pricey edition of one of the greatest albums of all time...  of all time!
B000VNMMQ6|5.0|When I heard that there was going to a 4th \\"Die Hard\\" installment to the franchise--my heart sank!! Why? Because the last 2 sequels were pale repeats of the original premise with slight modifications in the plot like the hi-jacking of a plane or the threat of bombs blowing up in NYC.  The franchise seemed burned out and of course Willis himself was getting long in the tooth for these shenanigans!!  But lo and behold we get a re-boot in a plausible story line of how a disavowed  or disgrunted government worker creates a \\"fire sale\\" by hacking in on the main computers in the nation.  How's that for originality which was lacking in the sequels?  Also for once Willis is not such a super-hero like he was in the sequels and gets help from computer hacker Justin Long (that \\"Apple guy\\" in the commercials)--they are a perfect pair.  Though the villain, Timothy Olliyphant isn't engaging as Alan Rickman was in the original, there's plenty of knock-out action to compensate.  Also the Blu-ray transfer is excellent so definitely get this one for sure.

B00005Y2EL|3.0|With my recently renewed interest in submitting album reviews, I've decided to change my thoughts on how I feel about this record now that I've owned it for a bit longer. With the addition of Snowy White and Darren Wharton into Lizzy's lineup, and Lynott's parallel solo career also being active, Phil and the boys try another stab at commercial acceptance with 1981's Renegade. Their previous effort, Chinatown, failed to break any new ground for the band and although it had solid performances and the sound of the group maintained a present-day rock feel, something just wasn't clicking.     With Renegade, it maintains a strong first half of material here in the title track(which is definitely one of the better early eighties' Lizzy tunes), along with Angel of Death, the record's opener, followed by The Pressure Will Blow and Leave This Town which are mid-paced to upbeat rockers that seem consistently interesting, enough to keep the quality level on an even keel at least. Hollywood is another Lynott/Gorham track that, along with Renegade, could have had some chart success perhaps, but unfortunately, it wasn't to be. Like my review for the next record, 83's Thunder and Lightning, the last half of this offering falls by the wayside and 2 of the cuts presented would have served better to have shown up on one of Lynott's solo efforts rather than appear on a Lizzy release. The blatant pop of No One Told Him really sounds like Dear Miss Lonley Hearts pt. 2 from the Solo in Soho release. Mexican Blood, though a moody and interesting number, just doesn't seem to fit within the mold of a Lizzy tune, much less for inclusion on their latest album. Fats is written by Snowy and Phil and although I personally enjoy hearing this track from time to time, its really out of place here as well within the flow displayed by the first five cuts. Only at the end with It's Getting Dangerous does Renegade gain back any momentum that was somewhat stalled by the last 3 numbers.     During the Snowy phase of Lizzy, I think Phillip honestly wanted to expand the parameters of what Lizzy could do artistically and by bringing in a permanent keyboard player Darren Wharton, coupled with Snowy's style(which was rather laid-back compared to those who preceded him, Gary Moore and Brian Robertson, respectively) the band made attempts to adapt and change within the new decade, but unfortunately, the newer trends of new wave/pop were much too overwhelming for veteran hard rockers like Thin Lizzy to remain active and relevant in the public's eye. Efforts like Renegade in hindsight, attempt to display variatable musical qualities within the time period, but ultimately fail in their intents to remain relevant by a lack of focus and direction. Still a noble effort, but now that its grown on me, Renegade is only deserving of 3 stars.
B001AVCFK6|1.0|The special effects were nice not great. The casting was despairing. The story was not Star Trek, not sure what is was. The Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry is turning over in his grave.<br /><br />The Star Trek genre is not there. Scotty is also turning over in his grave, they made him look like a buffoon. Uhura was Spock' slut. Sulu and Chekov where a joke. I recommend that you wait till it is shown on HBO or Show time. Don't wast you money. Who would think that red paint could cause time travel or Vulcan destruction.<br /><br />They even cut out Winona's entire screen time. DVD sucked.
B002OMZTSU|3.0|This breezy look at a top comic seems lazy and stuck in the past to me.Who cares who the 3 other drunks were on that night at the party? Too much triviality and snarky cheap hits at Pres. Bush who BTW kept America free of all terrorists every single day since 9/11. No focus at all went to the gratitude he and all immigrants should feel to this, the greatest nation of them all.
0670020478|2.0|I wanted to like this book. The main thesis, as presented in the first few pages, is intriguing. However, considering the author's indictment of our education system, I expected to find the results of rigorous studies and an outline of practical solutions, both for how we can teach children and for how we as adults who are products of this system can transform our lives. What I found was a collection of anecdotes of successful people, no solutions and no practical guidance. In short, either this book should have been a 2,000 word editorial or the author should have done his job.

B002QEXN2K|2.0|Yesterday, first thing, I picked up a copy of John Mayer's fourth release Battle Studies. I awaited this project with more excitement than any I can remember for many years - what a flop.    I can't believe *this* is what took three years to complete.    1) Heartbreak Warfare: The first tune set a nice groove that I hoped would permeate the entire album, but it was the highlight that left me hanging. The only track I ever care to hear again.    2) All We Ever Do Is Say Goodbye: And he says it over and over and over... Nothing special... A Lenny Kravitz feel.    3) Half Of My Heart: Sounds like a Fleetwood Mac demo...    4) Who Says: Who says I can't celebrate whim-worship? Meaningful lyrics would have made this a good tune.    5) Perfectly Lonely: A decent bluesy track...    6) Assassin: Shoot me. Seal meets Paul Simon...    7) Crossroads: The Nintendo version. After hearing Mayer perform crossroads live, and peeling our faces back with it, I kept waiting on the fisher-price intro to erupt into a tremendous sonic groove... I kept waiting.    8) War Of My Life: This would've been a great worst track...    9) Edge Of Desire: Zzzzzz...    10) Do You Know Me: A great rough draft.    11) Friends, Lovers Or Nothing: Nothing.    Lyrically, the intellectual depth conveyed in Continuum (one of my desert island picks) was nowhere to be found on this project. After the rich contemplation expressed in Belief, Gravity, Heart of Life, and Stop This Train, hearing about his one-night-stands and recreational drug use is of no interest to me - especially if set to bland instrumentation.    Instrumentally, listening to this album is like watching an Indy car drive through the parking lot. Mayer is an absolute stud on the guitar; a fact of which there's hardly a glimpse on this release.    It almost seems like this album was a product of Mayer going through the motions of creative productivity, but without any genuine form of inspiration.    After this shallow mediocrity from one of the artists of our time, I find myself wanting Mayer to settle down and have children so I'll be able to relate to his ingenious writing and musicianship once again.    Too bad.

1427206031|5.0|More than just a book about Mallory and Everest - really engaging story with a gifted narrator. Real pleasure to listen to over the course of several days. Jeffrey Archer is an engaging story-teller with a focus on detail. I do not know enough about the subject matter to offer criticism. As a consumer, I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of historical fiction.     While not expressly 'fiction', a great deal of the story has been dramatized. Think historical 'fan-fiction' of the highest caliber. Sweet romance, nice walk through Edwardian England sprinkled with war and history: good stuff for long nights on the road or anyplace where a good story can fill the gap.     You get to learn about the business of the National Geographic Society and how early expeditions were funded; what the average 'explorer' day job was, how members were elected. I found all this trivia fascinating as I listened to the characters progress.     The narrator is wonderful. All the accents are natural and effortless. Each scene has its own flavor. Really brilliant stuff to get cozy with and listen to over and again. Well worth the price.
B002NWRMVS|1.0|I sincerely believe that the reason there're are so many dogs pictured in the printed material accompanying this CD is because the album is a real dog.  There's nothing original, nothing memorable, nothing replayable about it. I fear that Miss Jones is doomed to go down in recording history as a one-hit wonder.  Too bad.  She has a pretty voice.
0307269760|5.0|It is an honor to review 'Too Much Happiness' by Alice Munro, who I consider the greatest living writer of short stories in the English language.  Ms. Munro is Canadian and lives in Clinton, Ontario.  During her writing career she has garnered many awards including the Lannan Literary Award, the United States National Book Critics Circle Award, and the Man Booker International Prize.  Her stories have been published in The New Yorker, The Paris Review, the Atlantic Monthly, as well as many other literary publications.  I consider her an icon.<br /><br />With each book of hers that I have read (and I have read them all!) I think that she has reached her zenith.  Yet, with each new publication, I find her newest work better than her previous publications.  Her work is glorious.  At the rate she's going now, her zenith may be light years away.<br /><br />I find the metaphor of looking into a tide pool an apt one for describing the stories of Ms. Munro.  A tide pool is a microcosm of the ocean, yet it has a certain stasis and life of its own.  It is a living organism, relating to the macrocosm of life in many ways.  The tide pool contains living species of fish, reptiles and crustaceans, all delineated by their own life cycle which can change with the tides or with the events of weather.  Ms. Munro's stories are like this.  She will take a small microcosm of life and show how it has enduring and lifelong effects - effects which may be immediately observable or which may not be obvious for decades.<br /><br />'Too Much Happiness' is a collection of ten short stories, each wonderful in their own right and each one as rich and nuanced as a novel. Many of them deal with similar themes - paradox, movement through time, repercussions of impulse, regret, acts of horror and relationships.<br /><br />'Dimensions', the first story in the collection is about a damaged woman whose three children are murdered.  She goes through life feeling empty through she talks to a social worker regularly.  She is driven to visit and re-visit her ex-husband in jail.  At one point he writes her a diatribe about his revelations that their children are now in another dimension.  On her way to visit him one evening on the bus, she witnesses a car accident and attempts CPR on the victim.  Through the CPR, she can feel life return to the young man who is near death's door.<br /><br />By the third story in this collection, 'Wenlock Edge', specific themes begin to emerge - Who are we? Do we change in relationships?  Of what are we capable under certain situations?  Do these situations have particular reasons or are they random events related to our current environments?<br /><br />The story begins with a a young woman who has regular visits from her aunt and bachelor uncle when she is a child.  Her aunt dies.  The young woman continues school in the city and has a weekly ritual dinner with her uncle.  She also has a small circle of acquaintances.  Solely by chance, she ends up with a part-time roommate with a `history'.  This roommate is always getting herself into situations that don't work out and that compromise her virtue.  She is also a prolific liar and likes to be in one-up situations with others.  Both young women find themselves \\"on their way to deeds they didn't know they had in them\\".<br /><br /> 'Deep-Holes' begins with a family outing to celebrate the father's publication of a paper on geology.  During the course of the picnic, one of the sons, Kent, falls into a crater and breaks both of his legs.  He has to remain out of school for six months.  During that time, Kent and his mother share stories about distant isles and lands that are remote or unknown to mankind.  One of the children becomes an attorney, the other a physician.  Kent drops out of college and is heard from rarely and erratically.  He lives on the fringes of society and the question arises, `What is society?  The story reminded me of a novel by Carol Shields, a Canadian author, now deceased.  I wondered if this story might be an homage to Ms. Shield's novel.<br /><br />'The Face' is a wonderful story about a boy born with a port wine stain on half of his face.  His father abhors him for his looks and calls him `liver face'.  The father is rude, crude, awful.  The mother is sanctimonious, martyr-like and loving her son in a standoffish way.  The father avoids the son in every manner possible - he doesn't eat with him, talk to him or spend time with him.  Ms. Munro brings up a lot of questions about this boy's life and the metaphor of paradox is paramount.  \\"You think that would have changed things? The answer is of course, and for a while, and never\\".<br /><br />'Child's Play' is a story that is idyllic on the surface and horrific in the interior.  Two young girls attend a summer camp and during the course of this camp they do something that is never spoken about again until decades later.  Even then the extent of what happened when they were children is not fully absorbed.<br /><br />Each of these stories is masterful and wonderful in the telling.  I've read the book twice and appreciate it more with each reading.  There is no one living to compare Ms. Munro with.  The only writer I can think of whose short stories I love as much as hers is Eudora Welty.  What a group of two!!age to Ms. Shield's novel.

1416583408|3.0|Ms. Horowitz does a fine job of trying to explain the way dogs function in their lives with humans and the reasoning behind it.  However the lack of focus and the fact that she moves from anecdotes to scientific proof and back again really hurts the examples she is try to demonstrate.  I found her thought processes very hard to follow and believed that she was moving between being a very effective scientist and a good story teller but at the same time dropping some things off.     I was hopping for more with this book to be quite honest.  I believe a number of the reviews tell all that is really of interest within the book.  If you have a burning passion to learn what's going on with dogs then this book is for you.  I think most people will find it very thin and dull.

Of course you would. It's for a great cause, and it's a riot to listen to.

0385342020|4.0|This book was very similar but also very different from Kinsella's other books. The similarities were that the heroine was very much like the heroines in her all of her other books: job trouble, boyfriend problems, lying to parents and friends because they are in denial......sound familiar? Lara Lington's great aunt Sadie has just passed away at 105 years old. Nobody visited Sadie, nobody even really knew her. She didn't really have family of her own. Sadie, however, does not exactly \\"pass away\\". She is very much \\"alive\\" as a 23 year old ghost that only Lara can see. She cannot \\"die\\" until she gets her necklace back, which she seems to have misplaced. Since Lara is the only one that can see/hear her, she must help her.<br />This is a great story of friendship, love, and family. I enjoyed the twenties spin on it very much. I enjoyed this novel, as I do all of Kinsella's novels. The only problem I have is I always get very annoyed with the main character throughout most of the book, until the ending when they suddenly change for the better... but her books are always a pick me up
B0021L8UQ2|5.0|between this and star trek to me are the best two films of 2009 too bad this movie didnt get enough promo! the twist alone makes the movie off the hook. it is hard nowadays to find a good horror movie with good story, acting and kill scenes but this movie delivers all the way to the finish. it kinda starts out a lil slow but picks up like a kirby vacuum cleaner quick. buy this movie horror fans it is well worth the $20!
B0010YPTGU|5.0|Anyone who is a Bocelli fan will love this DVD.  Everything about the performance and everyone involved is top notch.  It made me wish I was wealthy enough to be there in person.  I was not familiar with several of the performers and will look for their music now also.    It seems to me Bocelli has improved since my favorite previous CD of his - Romanza - even though I would have thought that unlikely.  He has a perfect voice for Italian romance classics, probably the best ever.  I was a big Povorotti fan, but he was better with Opera than this type of classical music.  The backup music as well as guest musicians are all first rate as well.  Any classical music fan should have this DVD in their collection.
0786868724|5.0|Have a Little Faith: A True Story, by Mitch Albom is a book that I hoped might be an appropriate read this last week, while spending time with my dying brother during his final days.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Mitch Albom  has written a beautiful story about his amazing eight-year journey involving two men of God, two different faiths and two communities.<br /><br />Mitch Albom was asked to write a eulogy by his childhood Rabbi, Albert Lewis \\"Reb\\", when he was 82 years old. To do this Mitch made many visits to the rabbi's home to spend time with him, and his family get to know theme better.<br /><br />This time spent with the Rabbi gave the author an opportunity to reflect on his own lapsed faith. Although Albom had a religious education, but had pretty much walked away from religion. He was now a Jewish man, married to a Catholic woman.<br /><br />In the process of these meetings Albom meets a Christian Pastor named Henry Covington.  Covington was an ex-drug dealer who had begun a ministry to the homeless in Detroit. His calling came after a spiritual bargain Covington had made with God when he spared his life. The \\"I Am My Brother's Keeper\\" ministry, was a very poor church in Detroit. The church was so poor, the roof leaked and the building itself was decaying badly.  Despite this, Covington showed Albom how lives truly can be reformed when people have faith and hope, and reach for it.<br /><br />The book was written over a period of eight years, and the only bond between the two religious men was their belief in God. One Christan, one Jew, and their philosophy on life and death, and good and evil.<br /><br />My Thoughts: I think this book would appeal to both religious and secular individuals. People who were born into faith, have lost faith, or are still searching for something will find this powerful story insightful. From issues of doubting God, the importance of faith in trying times, and why bad things sometimes happen. The book is written in an informal memoir style.  I love the fact that this book was never preachy, but I did find it comforting and inspirational.  RECOMMENDEDook was never preachy, but I did find it comforting and inspirational.  RECOMMENDED
B002JTMNX2|3.0|Kelly Hansen is an amazing Lou Gramm-soundalike, it's pretty eerie actually. I bought this from my local Wally World due to the value of the package and seeing these guys on VH1. The new album has the really good retro-70's title song and it's the best song on the album. The remaining 12 tracks have their hits & misses and they're all pleasant enough - they would have sounded right at home in the early 80's but here in 2009, they really are out of step with the times. I think a better plan would have been to tack on the handful of stronger tunes here to the remastered hits disc - as it is, the 13 brand new tracks here just aren't strong enough to justify a full album. If they all had been as good as Can't Stop Now, that would have been a different story. Well, it's easy enough to do my own comp this way, but for 12 bucks, you get 3 discs, not a bad deal. Just don't expect anything on the new collection nearly as good as Double Vision.

B001AW156U|5.0|A few weeks ago, I played Borderlands on Xbox 360 over my friend's house and was so impressed that I decided to buy the game as the first FPS game for my PS3 the following week.  After playing the game for a few minutes, I noticed that the default control scheme for the game was pretty weird, mainly because of how the L2 & R2 buttons felt for aiming and shooting.  Eventually, I changed the controls so that L1 & R1 were used to aim and shoot.  I was able to play the game better, but after playing the game on the 360, I felt that the triggers on the 360 controller were better suited to this game.<br /><br />After a bit of research, I stumbled upon Gioteck's \\"Real Triggers\\" for PS3 Dual Shock 3 controllers at Amazon.  I was a bit hesitant at first, but I decided to purchase these triggers and test them out for myself.  And I am happy to report that these triggers are absolutely phenomenal!<br /><br />Firstly, these triggers are easy to attach and they snap onto the current L2 & R2 triggers easily and securely.  You don't have to worry about them falling off at all and they are just as easy to remove.  Secondly, they feel very comfortable, even more so than the standard Dual Shock 3 triggers.  The triggers are curved and made of the same plastic as the standard shoulder buttons, making it difficult for your fingers to slip off of them.  And finally, these triggers come at a reasonable price for a peripheral that works very well.<br /><br />So, if you want something \\"extra\\" that may have been missing from your FPS games using the standard PS3 controller, this might be a nice solution for you.  Otherwise, these triggers are 100x better for basic utilization for any and all game types.  Give them a whirl, and you might be surprised!

Get the album and listen to it.     Expand your horizons...

B0015OKWL2|3.0|With two screen legends, RIGHTEOUS KILL is like watching Ali and Frazier take each other on, long after their prime.  Deniro is no longer the man he was in Raging Bull and Cape Fear, while Pacino holds steady in another grizzled veteran role.  The missed opportunity here was to not give these two men more unique and dynamic roles - they had to be of all things, casted as old cops - which isn't so challenging.  They both wear the role well, but you sense they're doing it easily in spite of the movie's twists.<br /><br />Their previous pairing HEAT had only one scene with the two greats, but was a lot more exciting.  Less thriller and more a character study, RIGHTEOUS KILL is watchable, but it doesn't raise your adrenaline.  It's like watching the cops go toe-to-toe but never quite landing that KO punch.<br /><br />The casting is strong, but with so many strong cop shows these days - there's no point in making these guys product.  Deniro and Pacino can offer so much more - if you challenge them.  That's what the studios should do.  I'm hoping their next time out won't be a Walter Mattheau and Jack Lemmon kind of pairing.<br /><br />RIGHTEOUS KILL isn't bad.  It just isn't great.  But it does give fans a chance to see two actors tango together which I believe was partly the point.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I was never really never much of a fan of country music or Shania (just thought a few of her tops hits were catchy). However after watching Live in Chicago Ive been converted and extremely impressed with her musical talent and stage performance. It doesnt hurt that shes also drop dead gorgeous. From start to finish its an incredibly energetic and lively performance. Rarely do you ever see such an artist perform with such natural charm and melody - talent that cannot be taught IMO. She is really something else and deserves all her popularity. Her band also plays every note perfectly, the instruments blend well with her vocals and the chemistry between them is really fun to watch. One of my favorite DVD concerts and a good demo to show off a HiFi system.
B0009S2T0M|1.0|I had heard about Oldboy before.  IMDB has a very high rating for it, as does RottenTomatoes.  It's got revenge.  It's got violence.  It received a thumbs-up from Quentin Tarantino.  Everything seemed to be pointing in a positive direction for Oldboy ... until I actually saw it.  This was one of those rare movies that started out at 5 stars - I really liked the premise of the 15 year imprisonment and subsequent release - but then everything derailed about 20 minutes into the movie.  It's a repulsive film, about repulsive topics, populated by repulsive characters.  There's just not much to like.  Here's a quick tip for budding omniscient billionaires who are out for revenge:  If your evil plot is so convoluted and so drawn-out that the person you're targeting has to be hypnotized into REMEMBERING WHAT THEY DID TO YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE, then maybe it's time to go back to the drawing board.    ** SPOILERS BELOW **    On one side of the equation you have Omniscient Billionaire who:    - murdered wife  - framed husband for that murder  - imprisoned husband for 15 years  - used Evil Hypnotist (tm) to re-program father and daughter  - forced father and daughter into having sex    On the other side you have:    - guy who started a rumor that brother and sister were having sex.  Which wasn't so much a rumor as it was the truth.    I'm not sure what lesson Oldboy is trying to teach us, but it was lost on me.  There were just so many stupid parts to this movie.  My personal favorite is when Oldboy leaves Mi-do in the care of a gangster that had his hand chopped off by Omniscient Billionaire.  In the culminating 'This is why I've been torturing you for 15 years' scene, Mr. Billionaire smugly tells us, \\"Did you really think (gangster) would betray me?  You stupid fool!  I gave him an apartment so he would let me cut off his hand!  Bwa-ha-ha-ha!!\\"      Yeah.  Right.  Like anyone in their right mind would see that coming.  I will give the movie this, however.  It's not the type of film that you will watch and then forget.  Sadly, some of those scenes will be burned into my brain for quite some time.  Thanks a lot, Oldboy.

0714843377|4.0|This book great. I realized when I started reading this book that I couldn't put it down so I ended up reading the entire book in an hour. The condition was perfect, it looked like a brand new book. Also, it ended up shipping to me within a few short days.
032147404X|5.0|Quick tips, not so much theory as many other photography books, makes you feel by reading \\"The digital photography book\\" as if you were attending a seminar; where what students are looking forward to hearing is \\"how this shot was taken\\" or \\"what to do\\" in a certain situation.<br /><br />I admit I didn't appreaciate much Scott Kelby's sense of humour but this book gave me a push to take much better photos as an amateur photographer.<br /><br />Have already read the 2nd volume and looking forward to starting the 3rd one.
0061914177|5.0|I highly recommend purchasing Gary's book if you're someone who actually cares about building their personal brand and following your passion.  If you're not...if you're someone who loves the 9-5 and working in middle management and plays Call of Duty for 3 hours once you get home, then this isn't for you.  I warn you actually...if you don't have the hustle to live your passion, then this book will depress you.  Why?  Because this book tells you exactly what you need to know to build a business around YOU and what YOU care about.    The book itself is a short read.  Took me about 2 hours.  While short, it doesn't lack anything.  Many books fill over 200 pages (this has 142) with fluff, failing to deliver on whatever the tagline of their book was.  Crush It cuts through the crap and gets right into the good stuff.  Every page is important.  Not only that, but he clearly lays out (with a step-by-step list in the appendix) of what you need to do to start cashing in on your passion.      Please note that even though the book is lean and mean, he doesn't give you a \\"simple/easy\\" path to riches.  He clearly explains that it takes blood, sweat, and tears to truly Crush It.  If you're looking for an easy way out of the 9-5, then again, this book is NOT for you.    If you're truly ready to Crush It, I highly recommend.    -JT  [...].
0439813786|5.0|Fantastic pictures and use of photographs coupled with an interesting, yet bizarre story.  A must have for any educator's library, and a stunning example of a well-earned Caldecott Medal.
0439023483|4.0|A really entertaining and exciting teen read that's far edgier than I expected. Any number of people have already made the connection to Battle Royale, but reading The Hunger Games not two days after watching the film again made the connection seem very obvious. After all, both are about a government attempting to keep its population in line via a brutal competition; both feature teenagers and young children battling to the death; both feature shocking displays of violence from said young people. But for all the hoopla and complaints, the tone, execution, and themes of the two pieces couldn't be more different. The Hunger Games plays the competition far more seriously than Royale, eschewing the latter's social satire in favor of focusing on the effect of this warfare on those who participate. Beyond that, Hunger Games touches on the psychological warfare of government, the power of media, and even the effectiveness of propaganda. To be sure, there's a couple of teen-bait plot threads involving romance, but they don't reduce from the overall greatness of the book. Hunger Games is surprisingly unflinching and creates a fascinating world I'm very curious about, and sets up enough interesting plot threads to leave me very ready to check out book two of the series.
B002T9H2L0|1.0|To all the people who found this film brilliant, astounding.. or even a great film... you guys must have been high on cocaine or something cause this film was boring.  The best part of this movie was the previews... that is it...    Don't waste your money on this garbage.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|This 1946 CLASSIC FILM copy write expired and went to the Public Domain library.  For years on VHS a very poor copy was available.  But the film was sooooo good we endured the poor quality for the \\"WONDERFUL LIFE's\\" message was heard loud and clear.    NOW for the FIRST time it has been brought up to the Blu-ray HD (1080p).  With the HD Home Theater (BIG SCREEN) w/Dolby Digital sound I', telling you this movie is NOW THE WAY IT WAS MENT TO BE SEEN IN THE MOVIE THEATER in 1946!!!  (Better then the original 35mm prints).    BONUS:  This Blu-ray (2 disc set) Edition includes 2 HD versions of this MUST HAVE Movie.  Disc 1. - The COLORIZED version (my favorite version, especially in HD. The color adds to the grand detail of the clarity ie. Jimmy Stewarts tweed jacket.  On the big Home Theater screen you won't believe how Wonderful the picture is!!!!   And the sound is awesome!!!!      Disc 2 - Is the Original Black & White version.  A very good but much darker version which in my opinion mutes the HD details.  Still this HD Classic film delivers.  All extra features are also on this disc.           NOTE: This Blu-ray edition includes all the extras of the Standard DVD version.    BOTTOMLINE:  THIS MOVIE IS A MUST HAVE.  BELIEVE ME, YOU and YOUR FAMILY WILL BE TOTALLY DELIGHTED and Pleased to see and hear for the first time what a \\"WONDERFUL LIFE\\" this was and is!!!!     ENJOY!!!
0060989157|5.0|Motley Crue: The Dirt is a collective autobiography about the founding, the life, and pre-drawn conclusion of the band. Neil Strauss did an excellent job formatting the book and getting each member's candid take on Motley Crue. Contradicting views are brought together and a few outsiders from the record label also chime in on their experiences with the band. Motley Crue's inception set off a controlled explosion, with each member the fuel. Eventually the pressure of the music industry's \\"Machine\\" inevitably turned them on each other, ending with members finding themselves on an alone path without Crue.     Band members Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, and Vince Neil all offer there own perspectives into the world of Crue. Nikki writes nonstop, lengthy chapters about his family, drug problems, and song writing. Vince writes about his vicious womanizing and hobbies outside the band. Tommy Lee writes much about his role as the fun loving member as well as his helpless romantic side. Mick's chapters are short and offer not so much his take on the band but his take on the world and conspiracy theories. Later in the book after Vince leaves the band, John Carabie writes a few chapters about his take on being in Motley Crue and how it changed him.    The Motley Crue members take shots at each other then often forgive and feel guilt about how they acted at times of crisis. It is amazing to see how the band changes from being kids jamming in Los Angeles clubs to megastars. Eventually drugs, alcohol, and record label executives brought them to dark places in their personal lives. They get sober, they relapse, and the process repeats itself until you find the band grown up. After the band loses it's identity without Vince, executives push the band back together and they somehow get along.  This book was a great read; the tales of sex, drugs, rock and roll are timeless. For me the stories aren't that old, and it is interesting to look back at the event and see the bands view.
1577311523|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. The book relieved my suffering and I am pleased now.
1594488878|3.0|I haven't read anything by Nick Hornby before, although I have seen two films that were based on his novels (and both were quite good).  I should qualify my review by saying that I was a little skeptical starting the novel, thinking it might be a little too `relationship drama' for my personal tastes.  A romantic comedy may be a perfectly good option for a night at home watching a DVD with my lovely wife, but reading is a solitary experience, and generally speaking, I prefer darker nastier fare than what Juliet Naked promises its readers.<br /><br />But I really enjoyed the first half of the novel.  In particular I found Duncan (and Duncan seen through the eyes of Annie, his long suffering girlfriend) to be quite hilarious.  Duncan is a fan of a relatively obscure singer/songwriter who disappeared abruptly in the mid-eighties shortly after the release of his most critically acclaimed album, Juliet.  A mystic builds around the singer, Tucker Crowe, who has become a recluse in the spirit of JD Salinger.  Duncan is the eminent Crowologist, an obsessive fan who maintains a web site devoted to Tucker lore, alleged sightings of the singer, and interpretations of his song lyrics.  We meet Annie and Duncan while they are on vacation in the US, making pilgrimage to the bar bathroom where Tucker decided to walk away from his career.<br /><br />But the novel started to lose me a little when Tucker Crowe enters the fray.  After the demo tapes of Juliet are released, as a CD called Juliet Naked, Duncan writes a gushing review and posts it on his website, declaring it a masterwork.  Annie posts a contrary review and soon after, she starts receiving (and then exchanging) emails from the reclusive singer.  Annie and Tucker develop a romance of sorts but it never really generates much in the way of sparks, humor or warmth and compared to Annie and Duncan, Tucker isn't nearly as entertaining a character.<br /><br />Neither Duncan nor Tucker change much as a result of anything that happens in the novel.  They are both hopelessly incapable of creating any kind of meaningful relationship with women.  In Tucker's case, he leaves a trail of abandoned children and former lovers in his wake.  So this then, is really Annie's story.  Annie comes to realize that she has fallen into a rut and gradually makes small changes to regain control of her life.  This is a novel about regret and realizing that you have to make a conscious decision to get what you want out of life, otherwise it'll come and go before you know it.  The ending is ambiguous and it isn't clear what the future holds for Annie, but the reader can see that she's on her way to changing the course of her life.  I like that Hornby didn't give the novel an artificially happy ending or have Annie have a ridiculous and unrealistic 'epiphany moment'.<br /><br />All in all I found this to a pretty entertaining novel.  I'm something of a music buff and Hornby's insight into music, musicians, and the fans that obsess on them is priceless.  The prose is filled with great lines, sharp dialogue and some genuine laugh-out-loud moments.  Annie is a fully realized and engaging character and Duncan adds plenty of humor to the novel.  In the end, my middling review is mostly a result of Tucker, who doesn't bring much to the table.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I found this to be a good light read - funny, insightful - but the final third lacked something, and in the end, it felt a little flat to me.  I enjoyed it enough though that I plan to check out some of Hornby's more celebrated novels.  3 ½ stars.vel.

Cons  My 4 disc combo was missing the DVD copy or disc 3 listed on the back of the set..  Amazon is cool and sending me another one hopefully it come with a disc 3...  why is this a problem because it supposed to come with it and i was planning on giving the DVD copy to my nephew and niece...  But whoever Disney commissioned to make this set is a P.O.S.
B002QH2NUA|2.0|You think after almost 40 years of touring as a solo artist Paul's song selection would be a bit more creative?  There is no denying the quality of the majority of these songs, it's  the artist's interpretation and selection I have a problem with.     I understand there are many people out there who don't go to many shows and when their favorite artist comes to to town they want to enjoy the evening listening to the songs they all know, exactly the way they sound on the record.  Paul knows this as well. They want to hear Back In The USSR, Live and Let Die, Band on the Run and Get Back for the 10th zillionth time constructed the same old way.  BORING PAUL. At this point in his career he should be touring in somewhat smaller venues and picking out dozens of Beatles and solo songs he's never performed on stage.  He could stand up there reciting the London phone book and he'd still sell out. So why the worry, Paul?  Do you feel it's mandatory to do Hey Jude, Let It Be and I Saw her Standing There when you have gems like Lovely Rita, Two of Us and Mother Nature's Son floating around?  It's nice to see a few additions to the set list but this does not cut it.    For the most part Paul and the band perform these songs line for line, tempo for tempo with the same vocal interpretation as they appear on the albums.  The band sounds generic half the time just following the song book.  Does he have no ability to step out of his shell and be a bit more expressive?  Could you imagine a world where Bob Dylan or Neil Young went all these years doing the same songs over and over again the same ol' way? They've transcended by pushing the envelope and reinventing their songs countless times, giving the music a freshness which seems to be lacking here with Paul.     Paul, on your next tour grab yourself an acoustic guitar, let yourself loose and tour the world by yourself.  People will show up. Trust me...
0385504225|4.0|I enjoyed this book as much as, if not more, that his previous  novels.  If there is a flaw in the book it is that he made some of the characters implausible. The historical background was fascinating.  Here's hoping he writes another one.
B001FB55HQ|2.0|A few good ideas that were just terribly, terribly executed.     The reverse time traveler. I enjoyed that idea. Sam Worthington, con on death row is executed, but before dying signs his life away to Cyberdyne systems, wakes up in the future, and spends it trying to piece together what happened. Cool.    Beyond that...what the heck?   The first two movies (the REAL terminator movies) had this ever present mood to them. Mass human genocide was coming and there was nothing that they could do about it. People were going to die and it was just...really, depressing and threatening and remained this heavy presence just over the horizon.     But with Salvation...the apocalypse comes and...it's no big deal. Apparently much of the military managed to survive (chain of command included)John Connor is just a cog in the system who spouts gibberish over the radio, and... his father from the future is a fun loving, happy go lucky rogue...  None of which connects to the previous movies very well.     There is no emotional connection in this movie. The characters are just...boring. They're cardboard cut outs of people, people created to serve a purpose, but never given a chance to ever seem like real people. Hot American Indian chick, plot device to show Sam Worthington's character's humanity, and predictably help him out of a tight spot.  John Connor (Christan Bale), auto distrusts all machines which makes no sense given the previous movies. And we can't even go into all of the stupid mistakes that he makes for someone that was trained as a soldier and should know what the terminators are capable of. Bryce Howard playing John Connor's wife... Why does John Connor need a wife? Why does his wife play no conceivable purpose in the story whatsoever other than being there?   And could someone please tell me why Common was even in the movie other than he wanted to be? He must have something like 2 lines.    I think it's a steaming pile of crap. But I'll admit people have disagreed withme.     If you ignore the previous movies and take it as a stand alone. It's okay...maybe. I just feel that the studios have done to terminator what they did with the Aliens franchise. The good writer/director leaves and then the studios go right ahead and f- it up.     If you liked Alien vs Predator (all 5 of you) than you might enjoy this movie. The rest stay away...stay far away.
1594488878|4.0|'Juliet, Naked' is a return to form for Nick Hornby.  It doesn't quite meet the heights of [[ASIN:B001U69GJY About a Boy]], but it's surely a better read than [[ASIN:1594481938 A Long Way Down]], which left me cold.  In this new book, Hornby returns to the arena of obsessive fandom that drove [[ASIN:1594481784 High Fidelity: A Novel]].  But this is a different and unique offering vs. High Fidelity.<br /><br />You read the first third of the story thinking that Hornby will follow the arc of Duncan, his dedicated 'Croweologist.'  But Duncan moves aside and leaves the tale to his erstwhile partner, Annie, and Tucker Crowe - misunderstood and mysterious musical 'genius' - himself.  Hornby skillfully interweaves Duncan's vision of Crowe's life vs. the life Crowe himself is actually leading.  Needless to say, these are quite different realities.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|If you want to tell a story that everyone knows, then you use good plot, script, cast and director, and you tell the story better. Instead Paramount relied solely on Star Trek's reputation and spent the production money on high contrast, puke-computer generated color. Character development relied on mimicking quotes from the original TV series to the point of bad clichés from where no man has gone before. The story line is a patchwork of parts and plots taken from almost every TV show and motion picture. It's a shame because a real writer could've had fun developing these characters through the trials and tribulations of Starfleet academy, and how they earned their way to the Starship Enterprise!     It gets worse as the movie progresses. Nobody twisted Paramount's arm to go back to Kirk and Spock. These are big shoes to fill, so when the characters start to stumble, the real actor takes over. Did I mention puke earlier? That's what the computer generated special effects (CGSE) make me do. Since when are the props the show? Since Paramount skipped hiring writers and a director and kept the money for themselves. For instance, the bad guy in the movie is a Romulan named Nero who looks more like a pointy eared refugee from a US Prison's tattoo parlor. Anyway he's mad at Spock and Starfleet for some SciFi slight and he's come back from the future to make them pay. Well that's a new concept for Star Trek, time travel. When ever this plot starts to go anywhere the scenes switch to CGSE, a cartoon rollercoaster ride. It's as if this movie were created for an audience of people who suffer from Attention Deficit Disorder, not us Trekies! If this is just a taste of what's in store for us in the future from Paramount, save your money and read a book.

Whomever said any of these movies was \\"grainy\\" didn't watch it on a TV as good as my Mitsubishi Diamond Series.<br />The story was great and endearing, the casting was great, Spiderman was perfect and the HD was breataking.<br />This is what good movies are all about: telling a story, using artistic means to do it, and have a great cast to do it.<br />And, of course, the ending was great too.
B0002IQKRM|5.0|A romantic lesbian comedy... doesn't seem like it would have the makings of a classic. Yet, this film is both charming and powerful, destined to become a classic. Both Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen are great actresses, portraying the turbulent ups and downs of life in a lesbian relationship. I found myself sympathizing with them, as well as reconsidering some of my own preconceived notions about homosexual relationships. It was touching to see them navigate through the stereotypes and challenges of expressing themselves. Furthermore, while I wouldn't consider this a hilarious comedy, it does have a quite a few good laughs. Definitely worth watching.
0882709194|1.0|While leaving my university after a class, I was given a free copy of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species.  My first thought was smells like propaganda, but I wanted to know whose propaganda it was.  It struck me as a little backwards for a religious group and a little high-cost for anything else.  I noticed that the back cover refers to biology as \\"a science founded on an unproved theory.\\"  I shall reserve my objections to this statement except to say that it clearly identified the source of the propaganda to me.      The next thing that struck me is that the introduction was clearly not written by Darwin, which is fine--introductions are often written by somebody other than the author.  The problem is, no author was given.  There is simply the heading \\"Special Introduction.\\"  I began reading this introduction, but due to several inaccuracies I backed off to merely skimming.  For brevity I will mention only one of these inaccuracies, wherein the author clarifies \\"...the Law of Entropy--that everything deteriorates over time...\\"    So here we have a mystery author, whose name was likely omitted because it would detract from the already dubious credibility of the work, and who clearly doesn't know a lick about thermodynamics.  I had to find out more.  No information is given regarding the source of the book information's, the ISBN number is valid and the publisher seems legit.  A bit of googling around, though, brought me to [...] where a video is posted that explains the project, and where you can find the full text of the introduction.  The video explains how I am being brainwashed by an army of atheistic professors and claims that this book will show me the light.       The project is predicated upon the idea that I will read and believe anything that is written and bound.  It is based on the belief that because I sit quietly in class without objecting to the course content then I must also fail to object to negative remarks about gays and ridiculously skewed representations of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam (which is the content of the second half of the introduction).  As a student I am deeply offended and as a Christian I am ashamed to see fellow Christians acting this way.     Feelings aside, this type of slander is simply bad form.  If you want to show why somebody is wrong, publish your own argument--it has never been acceptable to republish somebody else's work with your own introduction entitled \\"why the rest of this book is hogwash\\".  Surely nobody would take seriously \\"The Holy Bible, with Special Introduction by Aleister Crowley,\\" yet such attribution information has been removed from this book and I fear it might slip under somebody's radar as credible information, which is why I have written this review.
B002HWRZH0|5.0|What can I say, I'm a HUGE Trekkie.  I know this was more expensive than just getting the Blu-ray alone, but I just couldn't help myself.  The replica of the USS Enterprise, NCC 1701 from the movie is perfect.  A heavy, solid and beautiful piece of Star Trek memorabilia that is well worth the price.  Everything arrived on time and packaged with great care.  This is one item that will be cherished for years to come.
B000UJ48WC|4.0|I love THE SHINING with a passion usually reserved for movies like THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW; I bought the Stanley Kubrick boxed set in 2001 and watch it regularly.  I've turned down other Blu-ray editions of Kubrick films (EYES WIDE SHUT and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE) because I didn't think they were up to snuff, but I bought this because it managed to win me over.    THE SHINING is a GLORIOUS TRANSFER: the colors and textures are more vibrant and powerful than I have ever seen and seeing all those minor backgrounds details big enough to read easily are a real treat.  The picture is crisp, sharp, clear, and doggone if the movie doesn't look as new as the day it was made.  Kubrick movies are always a bit skimpy on the extras (Kubrick died before DVD took off and didn't leave many leftovers for the medium anyways), but the \\"making of\\" documentary with commentary also made the crossover, as well as a few new featurettes that aren't that amazing, but do offer some cool new tidbits; my favorite is the one on production design with Kubrick staffers and Garret Brown, where we get to see diagrams and schematics of the set.    My one gripe comes from the aspect ratio, which is a never-ending argument with Kubrick movies.  The old DVDs maintained a full-frame aspect ratio while the Blu-ray releases favor the 1.85:1 ratio enhanced to fit the 16:9 screen.  As the diagram on the special features reveals, Kubrick preferred the full-frame 1.33:1 aspect ratio, but always shot to preserve the 1.85:1 for theatrical exhibition.  The problem is, Kubrick's compositions were always strongest from top-to-bottom, not side-to-side, so the widescreen aspect ratio trims off the headroom that was beautifully visible on the old DVD set.  The Blu-ray is presented in 1.85:1 enhanced for 16:9 so it fills the screen; yes you see more image on the sides than you did on DVD, but the shots don't stand out as much because of the missing headroom.    So for this reason alone, I trim off one star.  Otherwise, I love this Blu-ray and heavily recommend it.
B002MW50KO|1.0|If the proceeds of this album went to anything but charity, I would be upset.  I am a long time Dylan fan, but this is ridiculous.  I have never, ever, heard a worse version of Hark the Herald Angels Sing in my life.  Dylan's songs and singing have been a great pleasure and comfort to me many many times.  This album, however, is godawful.  Drop your money in the Salvation Army Pot on the way into the store.  The emperor has no clothes!
B001992NUQ|3.0|Instead of trying to inflate my self-importance by pretending to be an amateur movie critic and arguing the good/bad aspects of FIGHT CLUB, I'm going to review the actual BLU-RAY DISC for the people who may want to buy it.  I will say this: I didn't like this movie at first because I didn't know it was supposed to be satire, and I didn't know what to look for; watching it on DVD changed my mind.  There.  DON'T THROW OUT YOUR 2-DISC DVD JUST YET.  Except for HOT FUZZ and SERENITY, I've never seen a perfect DVD-Blu-ray conversion, and this is why FIGHT CLUB only gets 4 stars instead of 5.  Most of the important production materials from the 2-Disc Special Edition are here (titles, location footage, deleted scenes, etc.) but some of the footage from the DVD didn't make it (like the BTS fight choreography training); the fact that this has been replaced by a perfunctory Spike TV awards show clip (probably chosen because it was in HD) isn't much consolation.  There's also no retrospective documentary, which a film like this probably deserves.  The special features menus is a little hard to navigate because there's no color highlighting on the titles, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be okay.  Probably the most irritating thing is the chapter selection only offers one chapter at a time instead of a full screen of choices.  The film transfer itself is pretty sweet: the grain from the film stock is visible (very nice), but it tends to clash slightly with the compression leaving the grain looking a little bit \\"sparky\\" but not enough to be distracting (I noticed because I was deliberately scrutinizing the image, not casually watching it).  There does seem to be some inconsistency in the blacks from shot to shot, and you can also see some pixellation in said blacks at certain times.  Again, keep in mind I was LOOKING for this stuff, it didn't just jump out at me; although you might notice it a little more if your TV is about 46\\" or more.  But all this only takes 1 star off the review; nothing omitted was terribly important and the transfer is pretty great.  The movie itself looks as new as the day it was made and it thankfully hasn't been altered from its original aspect ratio for 16:9 TVs.  I think the $15.99 price tag on it currently makes up for any flaws.
B001TH7GT6|5.0|If you are looking for good-quality component cables for a reasonable price, your wish is granted by Amazon's bundled video cable.  From what I have seen the quality of these cables is on par with many brand-name cables out there, and at the same time, can be had for a significantly lower price.<br /><br />The leads are color-coded which really helps when you can't see both items you want to connect at the same time, and the 6 ft cable length is adequate without leaving too much unsightly cable in a jumbled mess.<br /><br />There's not really much else to say about this product except that I'm glad I got it.  When I need some more cables I'd be happy to get more of these!<br /><br />Lastly, each lead says \\"Amazon\\" on it!  This label may make these cables a must-have for the Amazon fan and video enthusiast :-)<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!
B0029O08WA|1.0|tHIS IS AN AWFUL ALBUM.  I LOVED the twilight soundtrack. This album was horrid. Dont waste your money!
B002NWRMVS|4.0|I agree completely with the reviewer who said this album is not really that different stylistically from Norah's previous albums under her own name. The songs themselves are not really that different in style from previous albums, and excellent songs they are, though their themes (break ups, etc.) tend to be somewhat darker overall. They further establish Norah as one of the better singer/songwriters of today, in my opinion, though I could have done without the repeated singing of \\"damn\\" in \\"Tell Yer Mama.\\" Norah's voice is as captivating as ever, and the recording sounds great (thanks, Blue Note). The most significant change on \\"The Fall\\" is the texture of the backing band. She's using more guitar and distorted-sounding electric piano to give the music a little more \\"edge,\\" but it works quite well most of the time. In addition to the bouncier tunes (e.g., \\"It's Gonna Be\\"), there are some nice ballads (e.g., \\"December\\") as on previous albums, and there are a couple of tunes (e.g., \\"Tell Yer Mama\\") that have a somewhat country feel like some of the songs on her previous albums. Don't be too surprised if \\"Chasing Pirates\\" gets stuck in your head after a couple of listens. It's kind of catchy. The last tune, \\"Man of the Hour\\" is a humorous tribute to a dog who has brought its owner more happiness than the men in her life, two of whom were \\"a vegan and a pothead.\\" It will probably bring a smile to your face.    In short, \\"The Fall\\" is a slight, but not drastic, departure from what Norah has released before under her own name. Long-time Norah Jones fans will probably enjoy it if they keep an open mind and listen to it two or three times before forming an opinion. \\"The Fall\\" might even win Norah some new fans. I've taken away one star only because I liked the texture of the backing bands and the arrangements on her previous albums better than the \\"edgier\\" sound of \\"The Fall.\\"    For those who really like Norah jones in this setting, check out the album \\"New York City\\" bythe Peter Malick Group. Norah sings some great modern blues (yes!) on that album, which was recorded before \\"Come Away With Me.\\" I like that recording as well as anything Norah has released under her own name.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|The Matrix Trilogy looks so much better in high def. Fight scenes like the lobby gun fight are out of this world and make you wanna watch it again!
B000VBJEEG|4.0|I purchased this one for a California artist friend who just returned from sabatical in France. While there, she was told that she had a \\"French nose.\\" It seems that what she'd grown so used to seeing in the mirror had a talent! A means to detect the unique, the illusive, the earnestly sought after! Odors, well-acclaimed in French culinary circles! Crazy! I told her that the mouse in this movie had one too, suggesting she watch him brew up hilarity when her day started out dark and dreary. And to create! Soup! Enough soup to fill the house with glorious smells!
0307269981|5.0|I liked the first book (THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO), but this one was so much better.  I can't wait for the last one to come out.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|Love this movie.  Not as good as the very first one, but very entertaining, still.
0307716988|5.0|The interesting thing about this book from a music fan perspective is that Michael describes the music industry and the process of creating music so well, it makes you understand and appreciate the hard labor he went through and the time it took writing, composing, producing and up to the end of performing a single song.  His life was all about hard work, even from the time most of us didn't understand the meaning of work he was doing it and it took its toll on him mentally...and then all his life he was judged for it. How can anyone have this kind of a childhood where your whole family is depending on you day and night year after year and the only true understanding you get from it is that you are so special that your life is really the property of everyone else and not yours. And when you try to break free from it and create a safe place for yourself where you are in charge and able to do the things you missed out on, then the world decides they have the knowledge or the permission to judge you for it.  What saddens me when reading his story is the fact that he was never allowed to be himself unless he was inside a highly protected zone...people always wanted something from him as if he didn't give enough with all of his brilliant music, performances not to mention all the gifts he gave to the sick and deprived..Common people, how much more do you want! Do you have to scream and mob someone who has given you all this...does it give you the right to invade their privacy or to judge them...no it doesn't.    If one of my children ever decides to enter the world of show business I will tell them the good part and bad part of Michael Jacksons story, and ask them to read this book to understand what it can cost to be a star.    Michael Jackson was a genius, childish yet highly intelligent, had love for everything and the believe everyone were able to be kind and good because he was.  The book Moonwalk gives you a look into his life and you can almost feel the happinessshine through at times...but you can also feel the tears between the lines.    Like rev.Al Sharpton told MJ's children at his memorial \\"wasn't nothing strange about your Daddy...it was strange what he had to deal with\\"!  If I ever would have met Mr.Jackson I would have wanted to tell him this: Thank you for your sacrifice, it has made alot of people happy and tought alot of people love, hopefully it gives you some sort of comfort for giving us your life.
B002I9Z8G2|5.0|This movie has it all - time travel, aliens, travel faster than the speed of light and the expenditure of large amounts of ordinance.
0143038419|4.0|This book confuses many males and empowers many woman to be themselves.  We cannot all be stereo types, even though sometimes the community we live in makes it clear that is what we are supposed to want.  This story is real to me in so many ways, but you have to read it with an open mind to get it...If you start thinking 'how selfish of her...or 'what a drama queen' during the first pages then this book is not for you and your mind is not open.    If you want to feel good about loving yourself for who you are and not for what you are supposed to be then you will love this book.
0307702103|1.0|I have read and loved every John Grisham book (prior to now). This is my first Grisham audiobook.  And although I listen to a multitude of audiobooks, I could  not finish this one.  I got through 3 of the stories but could not do another one.  I can't understand how so many of the reviewers gave him higher rankings.  (Most of the non-amazon reviews on the internet all average 1 star.)  Mr. Grisham's reads this book like he is at a first grade reading level with the limited inflections all in the wrong places. He makes it difficult to realize whether he is at the end of a sentence or not because he reads as if there is a period after every word.  I cannot believe the publishers let him proceed with reading this work himself.  Please, Mr. Grisham, stick to writing (which you are great at) and let someone else do the vocals... Thanks
B001NFNFNU|5.0|Wow, am I glad I gave THIS fairly lengthy film a chance!  Clocking in at just over 2 hours and 20 minutes.    You know the story by now- a mother comes home to find that her son is missing.  She does EVERYTHING in her power to try and find him, except, since the story takes place in the late 1920's, a young single woman has to face another challenge- trying to convince the local police her son is actually missing.      The cops are so crooked they actually think the mother isn't really concerned over her son and believes she WANTS her son to remain missing so she can start another life with possibly someone else, lol.  That's just one of many irrational theories a certain officer at this police department had in mind.    What makes Changeling so unbelievably good is the writing.  It's solid, it's brilliant, it's moving, and to be completely honest, it might even be perfection.    *Every single scene* is the very definition of captivating.  Angelina Jolie gives us a performance I wasn't sure the girl even had in her.  She plays the concerned/emotional mother role perfectly the entire time.    When the police try convincing her that a completely unrelated child is her own son, the story intensifies.  When the police pretend Angelina's character has mental problems and doesn't even realize her own son is standing right in front of her which prompts the police to send her to a mental hospital for a lengthy visit, the story intensifies even *more*.    Guess what?  That's only HALF of the things that makes this film so good.  The other half of the story focuses on her son, or rather, without giving anything away, something really really horrible that her son was a part of.  Unbelievable.    I HIGHLY recommend Changeling.
B001F12J48|1.0|Just repeating what has already been said here many times....the 3-D version is a HUGE disappointment.  Wearing the old blue and red glasses, I felt like the red eye was blind and no matter how I tried to maneuver the glasses the picture was at best mediocre.  I would get flashes of the 3-D and get excited, but then it would slip back into blurriness.  All I got was an incredible headache for my efforts!
075697237X|3.0|I blazed through this book in about 2 1/2 hours. Once I started reading I was immediately sucked into a fantastic world of hovercrafts, dried foods and the adventures of a \\"Bad girl\\". So why didn't I give it four, or even five stars?<br /><br />A few things. First, you can definitely tell that this book is written for young adults. Even more so than other young adult novels out there. It's simplistic and full of moral preaching. \\"Don't judge a book by its cover\\" and \\"Don't pollute\\" being two of the biggest messages being told. There's arguments for (or against, if you take the Pretties side) eating meat, thinking for oneself, etc. It's almost overwhelming and makes the story a bit less enjoyable for me, so.. take away one star.<br /><br />The second is the quick resolution. Seriously? Just.. boom, a confession and then everything gets turned around? It just felt all too neat and tidy. So much so, it feels like the cliffhanger at the end is more like.. a downwardhill-hanger. Sure, I'm interested in getting to the bottom of the story, but I'm not propelled to the next book like I was for say, the Harry Potter books or The Hunger Games novels.<br /><br />Is this a bad book though? Not at all! It's an enjoyable, fun read with lots of adventure, interesting characters and a vibrant world. Just nothing I feel like I need to run out and by like the other books I've mentioned
B002QH2NUA|5.0|This is an excellent live collection put out by Paul.  I've seen him live four times.  I remember in '89 thinking, \\"Boy, his voice is shot!\\"  But, somehow, 20 years later, he sounds better than ever!    Feel free to order from Amazon.  After all, they are obviously a very trusted name,  but if you want a real value, head over to Best Buy and pick up the Deluxe Package for  only $19.99!!!  This comes with a well-made booklet, tons of photos, a McCartney baseball card,  2 Cds, and 2 DVDs... one including his rooftop performance during his David Letterman appearance, and   a documentary.    I was hoping he's head all over the US this year, but this will have to do.  And again, he sounds really good!
B002SEW5WW|5.0|It is refreshing to know that there is a band like this one who knows the true meaning of good songs and consistency when making an album. That is why I will forever be a fan of theirs. It is as good as their first album, but in a different and unique way. You can tell that they wanted to aim in a different direction, which gives them a major plus! This album has NO FILLERS AT ALL! I have to applause Onerepublic, well done!
B00110K62U|3.0|I knew that this would be 'in concert' as the title states, but I wish that they'd recorded a live version of the performance...acting and staging. I'd rather watch that than the singers at microphones far apart from each other, disconnected, singing outward.. It was just a performance of voices, interaction with each other was rare, which made their emotions hard to buy. Also, though it was supposedly the video version of the complete symphonic recording, every note was NOT on here. They parts they cut were so weird!! The ones that stood out most: Gavroche's death!!, Eponine getting shot (it just suddenly, very jarring, cut to \\"Little Fall of Rain\\" with none of the \\"there's something wet upon your head, oh god, it's everywhere\\" bit), and Marius/Cosette's wedding. It was just awkward, and I found myself being upset that some of the highlights weren't there!! I don't know how often I'd watch it, as it's not incredibly more/better than just listening to the recording. However, it is better than no DVD at all.
B000OPPBEQ|3.0|Good but BR quality not the best I've seen; Probably due to the many dark scenes throughout the films; other than this, Amazon was excellent in delivering the product. Viewed on PS3 and samsung 120hz 650 series LCD.
B002QW7AJY|4.0|Awesome Movie that no one knew about!!! Price is high right now for it though, but i'm sure by the time it releases it will be down to the normal prices. This movie is very worth $20 to buy if it gets down to that price, which i'm sure it will.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|What a terrific movie. I was thoroughly entertained. This is what all the previous Star Trek movies should have been. It's full of action, yes, and visually stunning. But best of all, these are not the cardboard characters we're used to in Captain Picard and his gang. These are real people like the original cast was. Picard's group were like the people you worked with at the job you hate. Kirk and his were the people you hung out with on the weekend. The group in this movie are also like that. Terrific. Down to earth. Your buddies.    And funny. I was still laughing at the funny parts long after the movie ended. I like the original Star Trek and tolerate the sequels and movies. But this. This movie was a joy to watch, and I expect to watch it again and again. My only criticism is that the antagonist could have been developed a little more. Other than that, loved it. Absolutely loved it.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|good cast + no plot at all + explosion or chase scene every 5 mins = not STAR TREK but a TRANSFORMERS movie.  I particularly liked the engine room scenes that were obviously filmed in a BREWERY (what's a warp drive without water pipes, square cielings, and concrete floors?), the bridge that was patterned after an Apple retail store, and the inside of the Romulan ship that was obviously a collection of scaffolding on a sound stage with spotlights on the scaffolding.
B000E9910W|5.0|Great collection.  My favorites are \\"Another Park, Another Sunday\\" and \\"Music is the Doctor.\\"  Bought this collection specifically for these two songs.
B00005NP04|5.0|My introduction to Martina McBride was, of all places, on the Sean Hannity radio program.  He uses part of \\"Independence Day\\" as an intro for his program.  I liked what I heard enough to go looking for the song and I liked it.  I listened to samples of the tracks and I liked them as well.    I've always enjoyed listening to singers who can belt out a song, but can also dial it down when the song requires it.  And Martina McBride can do that.  I am more of an old-fashioned rock n roll fan and my primary taste in country music is the stuff that shows what it's borrowed from rock, as many of her songs do.  And her selection is pretty good.    The album has some songs that were true gems - Blessed, Wrong Again, among others.  I play this so often in my car, that I will wear it out one day.  And I will gladly buy another copy.
B000FGGE68|4.0|It was a great movie great action and great story line. You will enjoy this look into the future.
B001GCUER0|5.0|Excellent! this series just couldn't get any better. Or could it? I finally believe that not all Hollywood writers are brain dead. They have come up with some brilliant plots and the lines are terrific! Can hardly wait for Season Three to be out so I can watch it marathon style!
B000MTFFZY|5.0|I just love this album.  Delain is a group that is a one-of-a-kind in the goth world.  Charlotte's voice gives me the chills and I just cannot get enough of her.  It is amazing.  She is gorgeous to go along with that, which ain't too bad either!!!

0143038419|5.0|This book has helped shape my life. Elizabeth constantly reminds me of myself, all the anxious, social, romantic, emotionalness that is her personality. I have been inspired by this book to take up meditation and to explore myself and my relationship with God more deeply.    Some people hate this book, which  baffles me, but I feel sorry for them that they are unable to understand the spiritual beauty of it.  Their hearts and minds are closed, and they do not want to be changes.    Read this book if you are open and want to become closer to yourself and to God. This story is not about travel and adventure, but about becoming a better person and growing close to God and our true selves.
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|This is a beautiful musical.  The cinematography alone makes you want to live this story.  While others argue whether or not the \\"older\\" stars of this movie should have been cast, I feel the movie wouldn't have been the same without them.  To me it makes the story much more realistic than having better trained singers in their roles.  Funny thing is, I was never an Abba fan until this movie came out ...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A lot of the negative reviews for this show point out there was a fan campaign.  If so, that was years ago.  I just watched firefly this past summer after it being recommended to me by people I worked with.  I kept putting it off, thinking, oh, I'll get to it.  Then when it came time for me to go into the hospital to have my fourth baby (yes, I'm a woman), I bought it to watch on my iPod touch to kill time during labor (nothing reduces labor pains more naturally than a good distraction).<br /><br />I was hooked from the beginning.  I watched it in the order it was intended to air (starting with the pilot), not with the order that fox actually aired it in (which would have made no sense).<br /><br />I loved the design of the ships, the special effects (which others have criticized).  I thought the acting was very natural especially considering how dialoge-dense the show is.  They have a lot of words to remember!<br /><br />To me, the concept is more realistic than Stargate, BSG, or even Star Trek.  The idea that mankind might move out into the outer reaches of space to colonize when we've used up the resources on this earth made sense.  The idea that some settlers would opt for a return to simpler technology also made sense to me.  How many times have we wished for that on Earth-that-Is?<br /><br />If you like Hard Sci-Fi, this may not be your cup of tea.  Also, although I'm a mother of four, I don't watch this with my children.  It is not appropriate for young kids.  The Reavers are super scary, and even more so in the movie Serenity.  ALso, if you are a conservative Christian, which I am not, you might not appreciate the idea that being a \\"companion\\" is considered respectable work.  There is a \\"shepherd\\" or preacher on board, but that doesn't make this a \\"Christian\\" show.  I am a Christian, but not a conservative, and I appreciated the doubts of the Captain, and the conviction of Shepherd.<br /><br />Don't be put off by the fact that this show was cancelled, it had more viewers than most critically lauded cable tv shows.  It was aired on broadcast tv, and not enough mainstream people watched it.  If you're a mainstream kind of person, you might not like it (if you like According to Jim, this may not be for you).lauded cable tv shows.

B00243FQFA|5.0|A fond farewell to one of the best ever spin off series.Like the original Stargate,Atlantis was blessed with a great cast although it is a shame that it went through three Commanders in it five seasen run.I hope that we have not seen the last of the Atlantis crew and that some TV Movies will be made too.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|An Intricate & Captivating Masterpiece!<br /><br />When I heard \\"Apologize\\" for the first time on my stereo I was immediately blown away. I haven't heard such a beautifully, elegantly orchestrated song before in my entire life, or at least for a very very long time. I can't recall such an experience in the last couple of years.<br /><br />Needless to say, I purchased \\"Dreaming Out Loud\\" on a whim because it was on sale for eight bucks and an album can't be that awful, contain fifteen songs, and be hideous for that price. I ended up discovering probably one of my favorite new bands of all time and discovering music on a level unexplainable.<br /><br />Ryan Tedder is music producer talent extraordinaire. He has been on the map for the last few years being behind the scenes, but his duet with Timbaland really put this superstar on the map. Lyrics and production by Ryan for \\"Bleeding Love\\" just really put him on the map and it only went uphill from there when \\"Halo\\" was released. The boy just excels, but I digress.<br /><br />Dreaming Out Loud was constantly being rotated on my Zune and its one of the few albums that I listen to on a daily basis. With each listen I found something new to love, or noticed something in the lyrics that wasn't there before and just fell more in love with OneRepublic. I always thought in my head that if time came for their next album that it would just be a big feat to topple the mass appeal that was DOL. I have to say after listening to \\"Waking Up\\" that OneRepublic has done just so. If you loved DOL then you will love their latest effort \\"Waking Up\\". It's a CD full of new great material from an amazing band. The album is definitely more alternative and a bit different from the first, but it's still got the OneRepublic magic touch. Ryan has such a wonderful way of using words, so intricate and captivating. The album is a feel good album and just gives you the feeling of hope and the sentiment emotion to want to leave earth a better person.<br /><br />My favorite track is SECRETS. When the song starts and I heard those violins playing, I knew I was in for a treat and it was nothing bit a sweet treat. The sound of those violins were beyond hypnotic and Ryan plays and blends the lyrics and the chorus so seamlessly that it's nothing but stellar. Profound music on a cosmological level.<br /><br />The only down side is that there are only eleven tracks. I was hoping for fifteen again. Get the album and enjoy what a real masterpiece album is about.. When the song starts and I heard those violins playing, I knew I was in for a treat and it was nothing bit a sweet treat.

0312370849|5.0|This historical fiction is one everyone should read, as it places the reader in France during World War II as a Jewish girl and is so well written the reader becomes part of the action.  Living a while in the skin of someone else might help us understand those who are different from us or worship in different ways.  I bought copies to give as gifts.
B002QEXN2K|4.0|Yes, it is not as inviting to listen to as his other albums.  There's not a lot that stands out here.  Gone are the super pop, blues, rock hooks.  There are a couple nice songs but the album does not want to be listened to again and again like others.    Novemeber 2010- of course I didn't give it enough listens.  Much better after many listens.  Actually a nice change of pace- I enjoy this album for what it is.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|What can I say? Just cant stop listening to this amazing album. Every single song is a masterpiece, even though I do have a favorite which is \\"Islands\\". Go get this album, you won't regret it!
0394401522|5.0|Being very passionate about cooking and after seeing the movie, \\"Julie & Julia\\", I had to purchase the original volume of \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\". No collection would be complete without having each volume, so I had to purchase Volume 2 as well.  These books didn't disappoint.  They are filled with wonderful recipes but, more important, the details of technique - including the 'whys' are included.  This is the way I like my recipes.  And, though these were written years ago, the techniques and master recipes are still applicable in today's cooking.
1416594787|1.0|Okay, I know a lot of you are going to be upset with me, but I found this book, as well as all his others, to be lame.  Don't get me wrong, Richard is a very smart man, but when it comes to evolution, I don't think so.  He says this book closes the gaps of his other books for true evidence for evolution.  Why?  His other books weren't good enough?  So why did he write them?  Why not just this one?  He has a few things in this book that he claims are proof for evolution but they have been recently proven as false.    I bought this book, and I regret it.  But I do enjoy watching the \\"proof\\" for evolution fall apart in front of him.

B00127RAJY|5.0|First off, let me say that through the Weight Watchers program and the use of the DVD, I have lost a little under 35 lbs. This DVD is not a scam- the workouts are short but let me tell you- THEY ARE HARD! It took me a long time to get from level one to two, and equally long to move up to level three. I was not very out of shape to begin with, was not morbidly obese, did not struggle to exercise, really, but even if you have a hard time going up a flight of stairs, this DVD can still help you.  The exercises are all designed to help you work your way up.  Jillian encourages you to do as much as you can each day, while still pushing you along. I am not a biggest loser fan, but still love this DVD. I am hoping she comes out with a new one soon; I have gotten used to the exercises in level three and have gone back to two just for some variety. I also incorporated some jogging here and there.  If you get this, you will not be disappointed- if over 1,000 people came on here to add their input, how could you go wrong?  Change your life- you will not be sorry!

He argued that the modern banana, an artifact of artificial selection, is proof that god exists and teleologically created the world just for human consumption.    Debates in evolutionary theory are immense and beautiful, but they are nothing like the garbage you see in this introduction.    If you actually CARE ABOUT THE TRUTH, even a minute amount, read books about Evolutionary Theory that actually explain the REAL controversies. Stephen Gould v. Dawkins. Group selection v. Species selection. Ring species v. temporal speciation. Endosymbiosis v differentiation. Neutral selection v. genetic drift.    THESE are the controversies behind Evolution. What Comfort brings up is the sort of childish garbage that any first year biology student would ignore.     Anyone who find the intro even remotely compelling should immediately take some form of college or university level biology. High school biology will suffice for the most part.    Ray Comfort and other should be ashamed for masquerading as people who are celebrating the work of Charles Darwin when their true intent is to portray him as a racist barbarian.
B00275EGX8|5.0|This is one of the best war dramas that I ever seen.  I saw it in theaters, but I almost missed it because it wasn't advertised, or I least I did not see or hear it advertised. I went to see it with a couple of friends and we all enjoyed it very much!
B001UW58YU|3.0|Once again, Josh does a wonderful job performing all the songs on this dvd and goes the extra step to make the audience feel as part of the concert. The video quality is excellent as is that of the audio section, but the mixing of the audio channels was poorly done. Even though there is audio heard from the 5.1 channels, it is realy more like a 2.1 recording, thus eliminating the need to purchase the Blu-ray version. Nevertheless, the Concert will be a very nice addition to anyone's video/audio library and more so a Josh Groban fan.
2070612368|4.0|I knew one of the most natural ways to gain new french vocab was to read french novels, the same why one picks up one's own language.  I had picked up Tome 1 of my favorite, Les Miserables, but the realized I needed a few stepping stones between that and, say, Le Petit Prince.  Harry Potter a l'ecole des sorciers is perfect for that.  If you like the series in english and you know a little french, why not give it a try?  Besides...the french word for \\"wand\\" is \\"baguette\\" so that imagery alone you may find entertaining...
B001R60ESE|5.0|I purchased this dvd because it was highly recommended and I must say that I totally agree. I had heard a few of his songs on the radio and also saw him on a Bocelli dvd and this dvd confirms my prior impressions...Cris Botti is the real deal!!! The Concert was a delight to watch/listen and his guests just added to the enjoyment. A few weeks ago I had family and friends over and decided to play the dvd and needless to say, it was a huge hit.What surprised me was that even the younger kids sat thru most of it and said they liked it also. Needless to say, I watch it often and highly recommend it!
B0007E4334|4.0|Small hard bound book is well written and illustrated. A very essential book to have in your hobby reference wall shelf to pull down for a special project. The illustrations of braiding are valid for more than just leather.  Much of the old talents of the master braiders would be lost without documents like this.
B001JAFYFG|1.0|Let me start by saying that I love this film!  I just gave away my DVD version expecting this to at least be up to standards on Blu-Ray quality, but it falls below standards.<br /><br />The pro reviews got this one wrong - or they just let it off the hook.  The picture quality looks as if it came from a 3rd generation print.  It has tons of grain and scratches on it.  It is clear that they just formatted it for BD and let it roll.  I guess they look at box office performances and that decides if they should actually bring the film up to standards of the new medium.  EVERY BD film should be what we expect it to be - 1080P HD!!<br /><br />I almost regret giving away my DVD, but some scenes do show a little bit of HD, but most of the film is grainy, hazy, scratchy and shows a slime green hue on certain special effects like backgrounds.  Maybe the budget on the film was not high to begin with, but this release should have maximized what it had.  The sound on the other hand is really good with true surround sound!  The sound out performs the picture by a mile and is the only thing that can trick you into thinking that the picture is decent.<br /><br />They have been talking about doing a (another!!!) remake.  I hate remakes and I see them as nothing more than Hollywood running out of ideas and a quick money grab.  However, this one could use a remake (with non-British actors in AMERICA!!!!), as long as it is a part of the book series and follows the book and has the sequels as well.<br /><br />If you gave away your DVD like I did waiting for this, then you must get it.  If you did not, you can keep the DVD...
0689877692|5.0|I love this book and so does my son. He has destroyed it but it lasted longer than I expected it to. It shows how amazing paper can be and teaches science through art. It shows shapes and motion and is a truly wonderful book. I highly recommend it.
0385504225|5.0|It was such a long wait for this book, but I felt the wait was worth every minute.  I listened to it as an audio book - and I simply had a hard time getting out of my car - and I took more drives than normal!  I truly enjoyed the book - and in true Dan Brown style - this book was finely detailed and researched, and is unique in its style.
B00004YZFR|5.0|Read the other reviewers...not a single negative review.  This is what Rock and Roll USED to be before the advent of synthesizers, effeminate little boyz w/ ponytails and/or tattoos, \\"punk,\\" which, in truth, TRIED to \\"keep the fire burning,\\" James Taylor/Carole King et al, and...disco.<br />But what I REALLY, truly appreciate is that \\"ABKCO\\" or \\"London\\" or \\"Decca,\\" whoever, didn't prostitute Gimmie Shelter like the...pimps did \\"Woodstock.\\"  That is what adds the integrity to \\"Gimme Shelter.\\"
1416562591|1.0|I usually don't write reviews, but since I use other reviews to base my opinion on buying a book- I thought I better write one. I loved Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I loved The Help and since those led me to buy The White Tiger- I wanted to warn people. Simply said- this wasn't my type of book.     It is more a statement on India with a lot of symbolism etc.. it isn't an awful book- it just feels like a book that would go along with a classroom discussion and not a page turner like the first two books I mentioned. I never liked the characters or the story much at all and wouldn't give this book a good rating. It is only ok.  With so many books out there to read and buy I would pick another...
B002MW50KO|1.0|He cannot have been serious, right?  Hideous renditions of Christmas classics with the worst vocals I have ever heard.  In fact this CD is so bad you may start laughing -- particulaly during Dylan's Latin verse in \\"O Come All Ye Faithful\\".   But if you listen seriously, there is absolutely nothing of value here.  So was this all Dylan's idea of a joke?
B00000IMTH|5.0|5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />\\"Long Live Rock n' Roll' was for me the pinnacle of Rainbow's career. It took all the ideas from the former, \\"Rising,\\" & expanded & perfected them. This was RAINBOW, no shadow left of Deep Purple. It was hard, heavy, progressive, a master work of the highest order. It was Ritchie Blackmore's definitive statement of independence, his masterwork that would survive down through generations of heavy metal fans yet to come.<br /><br />The first song \\"Long Live Rock n' Roll,\\" just thundered out of my speakers, Ronnie James Dio voice thundering right along with the band, it was a wake up call to a band firing on all cylinders! \\"Lady of the Lake\\" had a swooning melody in contrast to it's heavy sound, again Ronnie James vocals taking the song to heights that no other vocalist probably could. Blackmore's guitar just wailing along with all the swirling textures & sounds of this great song! \\"LA Connection,\\" a riff monster of the first order just shook my ears! The exotic & ethereal \\"Gates of Babylon,\\" with it's middle eastern feel , may well be the best progressive song of Blackmore's career, & once again, that voice of Ronnie, wow! The speed demon, \\"Kill the King,\\" is probably my favorite cut here, Blackmore just tears through this song, showing some of his best riffs & leads ever! Ronnie of course just roars though it all! The monolithic \\"The Shed,\\" a heavy piece of 1970's heavy metal axe work! \\"Sensitive to Light,\\" a great song about magnetism. \\"Rainbow Eyes,\\" a beautiful ballad, where Ronnie James Dio totally shines!<br /><br />\\"Long Live Rock n' Roll\\" is one of 70's heavy metal's shining moments, not to be missed by anyone interested in the roots of heavy metal, Deep Purple or Rainbow. This is history folks!
B000001EIA|5.0|This CD is awesome I listen to it constantly! It really shows how talented this group really is!!
0143113100|5.0|This book ought to be read right after you read Learned Optimism.  It will change the way you look at your limitations.  \\"The Brain...\\" gives example after example of people that should not have been able to change their lives, at least according to outdated theories that are proven wrong in this work.      There have been so many excellent reviews, that I will not go into detail about the contents of the book, but I would like to share my thoughts as I finished reading it.    Several years ago, I read a book that struck a chord with me: Out Of the Box for Life.  Many of the ideas in that book are right in line with Learned Optimism.  As a person that grew up in a less than perfect home (didn't we all?), I found the frame of reference that I gained from reading these three books to be liberating.  The thoughts that have grown from my reading these three books focus on my ability to control my life.  \\"The Brain...\\" solidifies the scientific proof presented in Learned Optimism, which reinforced the paradigm shift that was presented by Out of the Box for Life by Berland.      I have learned that we all have agency to create what ever we can envision for ourselves.  We can make a difference in the lives of those around us.  It is better to believe that we are in control (because we mostly are) than to believe that we have no control.  Those thoughts will most assuredly create failure.  If a thought is based in truth, builds yourself and others, then it it should be nurtured.  Thoughts that may be true, but do not build others, or opportunities, should not be focused on.      A lot of the self help books I have read through the years were really based in science.  This is good news.  We are in control of our destinies.  We can think for ourselves.  We can grow and have fulfilling lives.  It is up to us.    Sorry for the ramblings... you may find yourself rambling like this after reading these books as well.  Just get them a read them.  See if you do not have a better outlook on life, and better control of your future.
0385504225|4.0|I know it has become fashionable to review wildly commercially successful novels and slam them with one or two star reviews, and I'll be the first to admit that Dan Brown's fiction is hardly classic literature, however the simple fact remains:  I lay in bed at night reading his work and I don't want to quit reading.<br /><br />Granted, you might dislike his writing style; the short cliffhanging chapters, the preposterously indestructible and omnipotent villains (present in both Angels and Demons and The Lost Symbol), the bizarre leaps in logic and analytical processes that enable our hero (Robert Langdon, a/k/a Tom Hanks) to work his way through the maze of symbols and riddles, but again, I have to force myself to quit reading at 2 a.m., when other writing has me nodding off at 11 p.m.<br /><br />As in his two most recent blockbusters, The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons, Brown takes a subject matter rich in mystery, legend and symbology, and crafts an immensely interesting tale, based partly on fact and largely on logical extension of those facts.  This time, his subject is the Brotherhood of Masons and their highly secretive beliefs and myths.  As in his two Catholicism based predecessors, there will be numerous blogs and articles pointing out the inaccuracies in The Lost Symbol.  To those, I would say: THIS IS FICTION, people, not history (though there is plentiful educational material in all of Brown's work).<br /><br />Bottom line, if you enjoyed The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons, you will certainly like this novel as well.  It is written on the same template and with the same style as his earlier work.  I'm sure there will come a time (as it did with Grisham, Clancy and McMurtry) when the formula will get old, but in my opinion it hasn't happened yet.  I must admit that the final 20-30 pages of religious lecture and mystic spiritualism wore me down somewhat, but the action filled and highly educational preceding 400+ pages more than balance the account.<br /><br />I am somewhat confused by those who vehemently dislike this novel.  Not because there aren't valid criticisms, but instead, why anyone that hated it would have read it in the first place.  After all, virtually everyone that reads this book has read The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons.  If you hated and despised those two, why would you even read this book?  I suspect many of those slamming this work, secretly enjoyed reading it, but are embarrassed to admit it.sed by those who vehemently dislike this novel.

0451196716|3.0|While entertaining, the book is simply too long. The plot is so simple ( walk or die ) that by the time I was half finished I was getting bored. The suspense does pick up again but the ending was pretty much a dud for me. The main problem is keeping the reader interested when pretty much all is going on is the same thing over and over.
0596522347|5.0|This is the best of the presentation books I've read because it really covers the notion of graphical display of information, not the how to use ppt.  There are also some online templates available.  Reading this book opens up the right brain quite a bit; that makes it worth the price and more.
1594202249|4.0|Readers of Thomas Pynchon novels in the past usually were left wondering about the mysteries of the plots and their characters.  So it is time that the author turned his attention to the mystery genre.  And while this novel somehow is classified as a mystery, featuring a psychedelic PI, Larry Sportello, a/k/a Doc, it is more of a far-out effort obfuscated by marijuana smoke.<br /><br />Set in Los Angeles in the 1960s, with Vietnam, hippies, drugs and the like running throughout, the plot begins with Doc being told by an ex-girlfriend that there is a plot to kidnap her current lover, a billionaire real estate developer.  Thus begins a bizarre tale filled with all kinds of weird characters, with even stranger names, a favorite Pynchon ploy.  So we find Dr. Blatnoyd; Bigfoot, an LAPD detective lieutenant; Denis (pronounced \\"penis\\"); FBI agents Flatweed and Borderline;  and a whole host of others.<br /><br /> It really is impossible to describe the absurdity of the novel.  Is it noir?  Is it a spoof?  Is it just Pynchon being playful?  Is it satire?  Who knows?  But it is all-encompassing and some might think it is a tour de force, and it is recommended.
B002V0WN2K|4.0|First, let me get something off my chest about the album...    I looked at ticket prices last night for his new album tour to the Honda Center and Staples Center.  Nose bleed ticket prices were $150 and $120 respectively a couple days ago.  So Jon, when you and Richie write songs like \\"Work For The Working Man\\" and you sing about dreams, hopes, and essentially the hard honest work many people do how is it you charge so much for seats so far away?  That's saying nothing of the seats closer.  I've loved your music since I found a cassette tape (7800 Fahrenheit) at camp when I was a kid.  I've never been able to see you and before you start to decline vocally which is inevitable I'd like to see you at least once.      Ok, now about the album...    There are good songs on this album but there will be nothing that really jumps out at you.  Work For The Working Man to me, took as close of a step back to the 80s with Jon's old bluesy rock songs.  He does prove he has vocal strength in a number of the songs but the songs are certainly softer than the 80s.  That being said, it's not the 80s anymore folks and Jon isn't 20-something anymore.    \\"We Weren't Born To Follow\\" is an upbeat song that I like because it really raises your spirits.  In our current time, there's a lot to balk about in the news and politics.  While Jon certainly sings about how things are now he does inject something upbeat and positive into the album with this song.    I'm not really certain I can classify \\"Superman Tonight\\" as a ballad but for anyone that's been in love it's a song we can all identify with.  It most certainly is a song that after one day of owning the album I find myself singing along to.      \\"Bullet\\" is a grittier sounding song.  Again, a bluesy sound permeates this song from time to time.  Perhaps it's a bit country inspired Kid Rock-ish in spots but I still enjoy listening to it.    \\"Thorn In My Side\\" is a bit generic while being higher tempo.  It hasn't really grown on me yet butperhaps it will the longer I listen to it.    \\"Live Before You Die\\" is a quieter song.  It's a song that really makes you think about how eventually \\" there'll come a day you'll have to say hello to goodbye\\".  So...the message is don't take tomorrow's sunrise for granted and make sure to live as full of a life as possible.  I like the song because it's how I live my life as best as possible.  I may only be 31 but I have my bucket list...the things I want to do and accomplish before times runs out.  I wouldn't say this song is for everyone though.    \\"Brokenpromiseland\\" is a pretty cool song for me.  It's definitely a song that has a bluesy twang to it but ya know what?  I'm kinda digging the bluesy twang in Bon Jovi.  I never listened to his last album (the country one) but I don't mind what he's being doing since Crush.      I'm still listening to the album trying to allow the other songs time to grow on me.  The ones I've written about are ones that I have a solid opinion about and for the most part, enjoy.  Don't expect a huge rock album out of this.  It's nothing even comparable to his 80s and early 90s music.  If you liked Crush then you will enjoy The Circle, simply put.
B00007J36V|5.0|This is a folk album. This is a folk rock album. This is a folk jazz album. This is an Irish and English folk ablum. This is a 1960s album.<br /><br />And this is a classic album. If people tend to overuse the word classic--myself included-it is sure not here. What brings Unhalfbrikling to the very top of the pile is not its use of so many different genres, although this is clearly undeniable. And its not the drumming, which is so smooth in both rock and jazz styles, it transends both. And it is not Sandy Denny's bell voice, which is so soft and so warm, but so clear and unaffected, it is a perfect instrument.<br /><br />And it is not ONLY \\"Autopsy\\" a perfectly played, emotionally stirring jazz blues, or \\"Sailors Life\\" which mixes the most rustic music with the most sophistacated playing.<br /><br />It is not only, even, \\"Who Know's Where The Time Goes,\\" one of rock's most beautiful ballads--so hearfelt it brings tears to the eyes, but so genuine and deep and cleanly played, it was the perfect peice for 1969 FM progressive radio. Friendly as a country campfire with its slide guitar, but a sterling slice of jazz dynamics and subtlety.<br /><br />What it IS is that Unhalfbrickling was one of those albums made on one of those days in 1969, when all the planets--including ours- were in the right place.  You had to be good, and Fairport Convention was even better. You had to be origional, and Fraiport were inventive geniuses. You had to be able to play, and these players were masters. You had to be genuine, and Fairport was, bone deep. This is the music of the ages, but Unhalfbrikling shows all, and I mean capitol A, of what was best about rock in 1969. The synergy is from another world, but in the most earthly of ways.<br /><br />Right time, right place, right songs, right band.<br /><br />Classic album.

0786838655|4.0|After months of procrastinating, I read this book based on a family recommendation.    When it comes to YA/MG fantasy, I'm torn between reading books that provide lots of depth and books that move at a brisk pace.    The latter type often makes for a more entertaining read, while the former is more compelling.    I found The Lightning Thief to be a relatively light read (perfect for middle grade and late elementary readers) that's full of activity, an interesting narrative voice and interesting interpretations and inclusions of various mythological figures.    I'm a sucker for mythology and I think lot's of kids out there are as well. It's got so many great stories and was begging for a modern adaption such as the one Riordan provides.    Though following the path of the classic 'hero's journey', the voice Riordan taps into (in the form of Percy Jackson) is quirky, fun and contemporary...and solidly American (a nice counterbalance to the Potter franchise). I may not have felt bonded with the hero, but I certainly was interested in hearing his tale.    Overall, a great middle-step book for young fantasy readers and not a bad diversion for older fantasy fans as well.
B0000AK7AA|5.0|In a small town in Main there is a legendary mansion called \\"Whipstaff Manor\\" which is rumored to be haunted by spirits yet it's true. a Lonely friendly ghost named Casper (Voiced by Malachi Pearson) is in need of a friend yet somehow doesn't seem to be making friends and his three mean uncles named Stinky (Voiced by Joe Alansky), Stretch (Voiced by Joe Nipote) and Fatso (Voiced by Brad Garret) loves scaring off intruders. A paranormalist named Dr. Harvey (Bill Pullman) and lovely daughter Kat (Christina Ricci) moved into the mansion for a new home and for studying on the paranormal as they don't know what to expect as Casper befriends them while the uncles want them out of the house.<br /><br />Exciting, funny and well done adaptation of the popular Harvey comics! Directed by \\"City of Angels\\" director Brad Silberling, written by Animaniacs/Tiny Toons writer Sherri Stoner and produced by Steven Spielberg is definitely good fun for adults and kids. The special effects by Industrial Light and Magic are terrific and the film does co-star Cathy Moriartiy with Eric Idle and appearences by some famed stars including Dan Ackroyd. There is some emotional moments like the climax and of course good laughs abound, it's a nice hit movie for everyone.<br /><br />This DVD contains a great widescreen picture remastering with extras like audio commentary, games, interviews, featurettes, Halloween tips, Deleted scenes, Talent Bios, and an episode of the 50's cartoon classic.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|This 2cd 1dvd set is incredible.  Having gone to the CitiField concert it was great reliving that evening.  Nothing can match the energy of actually being at the concert but boy does this come close.  The audio recording is superb as is the video. It's amazing at 67 years old how vibrant McCartney is and his voice sounds better than ever.  There are so many Beatle songs in this set that will please any Beatle's fan and they all sound terrific.  His solo material is awesome and the pyrotechnics during Live and Let Die must be seen. This is a must buy for any McCartney fan.
B000H7I6CU|4.0|This is an interesting video as you can select English, Mexican Spanish, or Spanish.  I suppose the Mexican Spanish must have diffent accents as well as slang words that vary from Spanish.  Not being a Spanish speaker though I can not attest to this.  My son loves the movie and has been speaking much more Spanish since the past few days of watching this video!
031606792X|2.0|I don't have many new thoughts to describe how dissapointing Breaking Dawn was... the other reviewers did just fine. I wish the person who recommended these books to me would have suggested to stop reading after the third enstallment (Eclipse) and imagine my own ending. The author seems to go out of her way to involve the mythology of Jacobs tribe, including the ancestors who's souls would leave thier bodies... I thought that tidbit of a story line was leading to something monumental. Wouldn't it have been incredible if somehow Jacob was killed (maybe he couldn't live without Bella's love so HE jumps from 'the' cliff) and his soul is released from his body but his essence still cannot be without Bella. The author kept noting over and over how Edward didn't have a soul... Maybe Jacob could've given Edward what he seemed to want~ his humanity~ and in the end Jacob could still be with Bella (in a sense) by giving Edward his soul. Bella would have both Edward and Jacob... Edward would become human again rather than Bella becoming a vampire. That would have been more interesting to read than what was truly written. I guess my only hope left is for the movie. Hopefully the author will have enough guts to let the fans get what they want through the movie rather than her marshmellow unrealistically happy ending.

B002TSK3E4|5.0|The great thing about 21st century Slayer is that they sound like 20th century Slayer. They wrote ground breaking/blistering thrash in the 80s and World Painted Blood would fit nicely alongside any of the other albums. In a music world where everyone wants to sound like somebody else (and there are a lot of bands trying to sound like Slayer during this current thrash revival) it is nice to hear a band that cares only about being themselves. If you are wanting Slayer to evolve, this album is not for you. Its still 100% pedal to the metal thrash. If you love their old albums then World Painted Blood will not disappoint.
B002BSHWUU|4.0|Super fast shipping (from US to AU) and very well packed, well done Amazon.    A brief review here, apologise for the poor English.    The package:  1, Overall, the boxset is excellent.   2, The digipak of each album is to replicate the original LP which is a well-thought design, booklet includes extensive liner notes and pictures, however, lack of lyrics.  3, I know there're thousands of books about The Beatles, but still feel the need of some brief history included in the box, maybe a timeline of the band?  4, Minor complaint with the box is that you have to take half of the albums out to get the one you want! Apple should do something similar to \\"ABBA - The Complete Studio Recordings\\".    The music:  1, No offence, but not every song is that great, just like every other band.  2, Early albums are pretty straight forward 60's music.  3, Mid era is a bit of experiemental, great music, but takes time to digest.  4, Later days - very mature yet radio friendly.  5, Past Masters include many classics not included in the official releases.  6, The Beatles is one of the greatest bands on earth, ever.    Stereo vs Mono:  1, I hate this topic but have to express my opinion. Please note, I played all the CDs in an aged Panasonic CD player and a Philip mini Hi-Fi. No high-end system involved here.   2, Having read many reviews about stereo vs mono, seems that the war never ends. I would say the stereo is good enough (I don't have the mono box). The sound is crystal clear and rich, I believe this is enough from a music fan perspective.  3, I can afford both boxes, but my problem with mono is the incompleteness - missing three albums. I was born after the beatles disbanded, a big fan but can't label myself as dedicated, so I'm struggling to convince myself to spend $300 plus for an incomplete collection?    The Stereo box is suitable for fans who just need a complete collection, not Beatlemaniacs.    I'll rip the CD in iPod and listen for most of the time in mp3 format. To getmore involvement in the music, I will play The Beatles Rock Band. If you're a music fan like me, go for the Stereo box.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Though based on historic people and events, this series is unabashedly fictional in the particulars. The most impressive thing about the series is the integrity and plausibility with which the culture of fictional Rome is depicted. The characters are without exception motivated by selfish, this-worldly values, be it power, wealth, pleasure, love, or personal integrity. Human life as such is valued no more highly than animal life. The differences between people are extreme, from willful nobility who dictate the actions of legions based entirely on personal motives, to slaves completely devoid of willpower. Excellent writing, characters, acting, direction, and production value.
1400064627|5.0|I bought this book years ago when I saw the movie adaptation, and as usual found the book to be even better than the movie.  Being a born and raised child of the South, this book speaks right to my soul.  The community of whistle stop might as well be Hooks, TX,(where I spent my childhood).  The food, the relationships, all of it nourishes my soul like a glass of iced tea and pecan pie.<br /><br />The characters in this book are so rich, Idgie, Big George, Ruth, Sipsey, Onzell, Ninnie, Evelyn, all of them have such a dynamic personality, Fannie could have written a whole book about each one of their lives(I wish she had).  What I especially liked about the book is the attention she does give to each of the characters.  By the time the book was over I felt like I personally knew at least a dozen of them, and was sad to say goodbye to them.<br /><br />Fannie describes the communities in the book perfectly almost to the point that I could smell the train smoke mixing with the Fried Green Tomatoes.  The book is funny, exciting, and truly has everything that a good book should have.<br /><br />This is my favorite book of all time.  I read it once a year, and it's fresh everytime I pick it up.
B002QEXN2K|3.0|You never know what to expect from this guy.  I've been a fan since day one and will continue to buy his albums on the day of their release.  I've seen him live and it was my favorite show ever. There are so many faces of JM.  His crooning appeals to the ladies, his songwriting appeals to true musicians, and his ax slinging is out of this world.  He's brought it all out in his past albums.    With all that said, it sounds like he wants to wail on this one but is holding back.  This CD reminds me of Heavier Things.  It sounds like something he was trying to accomplish back then, but that was better.  There is no blues on this album ... He's not being very progressive on this one.  It's all cheezy break up songs. Mediocre lyrics and dissapointing chord structures, there are so many more creative ways he could have went with this album and it feels like he just got lazy and is trying to sell out somehow.  I'm confused on his goal with this one.  \\"Perfectly Lonely\\" sounds like something ripped from the Eagles Long Road Out Of Eden disk.  \\"Who Says\\" should have been a James Taylor song.  And \\"Crossroads\\" sounds like something I could have made on Mario Paint (I wonder what Clapton thinks of this one), he's performed this song with Clapton and it was a million times better.  And what's the deal with Taylor Swift on \\"Half of My Heart\\"? - it reminds me of Vannessa Carlton's role in Big Yellow Taxi with the Counting Crowes, what's the point?    All-in-all, if you're a JM fan then you probably already have the disk.  If not, and you're looking to try out JM, go get the \\"Where the Light Is\\" double disk.  Only die-hard Mayer fans will listen to this more than once, I'm hoping it will grow on me.
0060775858|5.0|My 21 month old son has me read this book to him EVERY night.  He loves it!  He points out the clock, the light, the balloon, the moon, and the rabbit who is going to sleep.  His favorite page is the last page when the room is dark and the little old lady has gone.  I just can't say enough good things about this book.
B0000844I8|3.0|Stargate released in 1994,was a film that was underappreciated by most critics at the time garnering mixed to poor reviews.But the general public liked what they saw and gave out,much to the delight of its' producers,at the box office.The movie went on to influence other subsequent films(such as the opening of the Fifth Element) and spawned video games(direct and indirecty),along with the ever popular TV series franchise.<br />The film opens with the discovery of a circular device and the fossilized skeleton of a being of some sort,buried in the Egyptian desert in 1928.Fast forward to modern day and a Dr.Jackson(James Spader) who is giving an ill-received lecture on who exactly built the great pyramid in Egypt.Afterwards an elderly woman arrives and invites him to join her at a research facility run by the military in Colorado.<br />There they have in their hands the device found in the sand and want Jackson to decipher the writing.He does and inadvertantly gives the military brass the code to start up a working replica of the device.The project is headed by Col.O'Neil(Kurt Russell) and he leads a military team along with Dr Jackson through,what is now referred to as,the Stargate.The \\"other side\\" is light years from earth and is a planet much like the Egyptian desert,complete with their emergence point in a similarly structered building,dwarfed from behind by a huge pyramid.<br />In due time they find a colony of human slaves who are mining the material that composes the Stargate.Dr Jackson slowly but surely learns the language and eventually finds the key that will enable the team to return to Earth.But in the meantime the beings who oversee all this,return and wreak havoc with Col.O'Neil and company.It is learned that the aliens have taken humans as hosts and actually are the ones responsible for creating civilization on Earth thousands of years before.But the alien leader informs them they should never have opened the Stargate and plans to send back a bomb to destroy the Earth.In a race against time,an uprising by the slaves and a ticking bomb that can't be turned off,O'Neil and Jackson narrowly manage to turn the tables on the aliens as they try to escape and thus destroy them.Dr Jackson stays behind while the remaining team members return to earth.The movie ends as O'Neil says to Jackson that he will \\"see him around\\".<br />This left the movie up for an obvious sequel but,much to my disappointment,none has ever been forthcoming despite numerous rumours to the contrary.The latest rumour is that once the TV series has finally finished then we will see a sequel;but that remains to be seen.<br />Russells' career at the time had been a mixed one up Stargate having had more hits in the 80s(The Thing,Escape from New York,Used Cars,Big Trouble in Little China)with little of substance/success after,other than a notable supporting role in the hit Backdraft in/91.Spader on the other hand had been a pretty hot property at this time(his most popular time in fact) having had a more consistent string of recent successes(Mannequin,Pretty in Pink,Wall Street,Sex,Lies and Videotapes)than the more established Russell.That is why both share top lead.However while Spader had the lions share of screen time,Russell manages to dominate every scene he is in which says much  about his acting chops.<br />The story generally flows well but the action gets bogged down on sideplots concerning the slaves working for the aliens.All concerned do a wonderful job but it is the (then)unique concept and angle this film gives us that really manages to fascinate and ultimately sell it.It must have made an impression,for while we have yet to see any sequels at the theatres,there has been a wildly successful little screen franchise going on for years.<br />This so called \\"Directors Cut\\" is clocked in,on the sleeve at least,as 119 minutes.Well the ACTUAL screen time is just over 123 minutes,with the credits extending it to around 130 minutes!Underselling their product.<br />The sleeve also tells us that this film has been remastered.Well I think someone needs to do some more work on this.The picture can get slightly washed out and grainy at times;not what a \\"remastered\\" print should look like.The sound however is very good,available in Dolby 2,5.1 and 6.1 DTS.The \\"ultimate\\" features are just an audio commentary by the director and producer and a small 10 minute film on the concept of alien vistors in ancient times and its'conceptual \\"father\\" Erich Von Daniken.Not much for an\\"ultimate edition\\",so it loses marks there also.The film is in its' original widescreen format.The copy I received of this film is a bit different than the one shown here for sale.The DVD I got is in a case with the same artwork as depicted(brown colour with the ring over the pyramid).However THAT case,in turn,has a nice looking sleeve over IT;a colourful holographic version of the case cover.I hope yours comes this way also.<br />In the end this film still holds up quite nicely after 15 years,both in the acting and concept departments.And while the film does needs a proper tweaking on the remastering,overall I think you will still enjoy what you see.us that this film has been remastered.Well I think someone needs to do some more work on this.The picture

B001PR0YDA|5.0|I just saw this movie in the theater.  I just loved it.  The animation is so life like.  Now I did see it in 3D which was outstanding and added to the enjoyment of this film.  The story is the original story which I'm sure you've all seen some version of it and it keeps very true to the original.  It was just a feel good movie.  Jim Carrey did a good job as scrooge.  I had tears in my eyes at the end.  I buy about one movie every couple of years and I plan on buying this one so for me that is saying something.

0307474429|5.0|Never having read Frankenstein, and finally being required to read this edition of the text for a graduate course, I was pleasantly surprised by both Mary Shelley's story and Dr. Robinson's obvious dedication to the text.  The presentation is stellar--he gives clear distinction to the text Mary Shelley wrote and then shows where Percey Shelley edited/suggested changes.<br /><br />Aside from the fantastic scholarship going into this book, on a the physicality of the book; I've never (imagine this in italics:) felt a nicer book.  The pages and the cover combined are the most satisfying-to-hold book combination I've ever experienced.  That sounds a little strange, but maybe it has something to do with a lot of book-holding experience.
0061914177|5.0|I'm tired of hearing that the world is collapsing because the economy is failing because people aren't spending money because because because...  Lets stop that cycle - look inside, instead of at the outer circumstances we face, and evaluate how each one of us can be our best business person. This book inspires one to look critically at what you have to offer, how you can use it and most importantly, is that what you want to do?    This is a fabulous book even if you have no intention of going into business.  I love that it makes you really look at who you are being - what do you bring to the table.      My favorite all time quote is \\"Your playing small doesn't serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you.\\" by Nelson Mandela  This book totally speaks that idea.
0385504225|4.0|Dan Brown is an impressive researcher. Reading The Lost Symbol was educational as well as entertaining.     However, although the personal story moves the book along, I am not satisfied that I know his characters well by the end of the book. Actually, I thought these characters, including the recurring Robert, were a bit two-dimensional as they were in The DaVinci Code. Even with a startling twist that occurs in this book, they did not come to life for me. A little too much telling and not enough showing how they react.    My four stars are based on the interesting revelations about Masonry and the passion that drives so many members of the fraternity and the descriptive passages about places we've all heard about. I can't wait to see the movie.    Now that he's taken on the Church and Masonry, I wonder what's next.
B0028RXXFC|4.0|For the kind of money customers fork over for movies it is mind boggling that distributors fail to create good packaging, especially for a series like Rome. They got it right the first time with the previous dvd release, in the wooden cases. This time they did a good job with the size of the boxes, but the discs are held in cardboard sleeves with plastic underneath the disc. They are extremely difficult to get out of the case without tearing the case or scratching the discs.<br /><br />Apart from that, this series looks and sounds as good as it ever has on blu-ray. For an upgrade if you own the dvds, I would wait for it to drop form $85.00. For a first time buy, I think its worth it.
0439023483|5.0|From the author of the bestselling Underland Chronicles come the first in a brilliant new series that will change how you view your everyday life in more ways than you can count.  Collins has taken a science fiction archetype - a doomed future world where everyone gets by, barely - with a certain cast of characters that sets off the readers emotions to unknown bounds.    North America.  The future.  Now known as Panem, it is a changed world, the country divided into districts, each district with its own industrial focus - minding, farming, manufacturing.  For the most part, many in the districts struggle to get by, struggle to survive.  Our main character, Katniss Everdeen, is a sixteen-year-old girl who has spent her life helping her family - her mother and younger sister - hunting for food and scraps, fighting to keep them all alive.  She is a teen beyond her years.      The annual event of the Hunger Games arrives: a stark reminder of how worse things could really be if the Capitol didn't control the districts.  A boy and a girl - between twelve and eighteen - are selected from each district and forced to participate in the Games.  Katniss's younger sister gets picked, and Katniss does what she's always done: steps in front, volunteering in her sister's place, saving her life.  Then she is off to the Hunger Games.    In the style of The Running Man, it is a nationally televised event, akin to the gladiatorial games of Rome, with much pomp and circumstance.  Twenty-four kids find themselves put into the \\"ring\\" - an unknown terrain that may or may not be habitable - and with the sound of a gong and the start of the games, they must fight each other to the death until one last child remains standing.  The children find themselves under constant pressure, to survive in the environs, to defend themselves against each other, and if the viewers get bored, creatures may be released to keep them on their toes.    The Hunger Games is one of those books that could be shelved in the young adult section for its use of teen characters, or the science fiction section for its powerful storytelling of a future world with some undeniable and harsh similarities to our own, or the fiction section for is strong characters who deal with very human emotions while fighting each other to survive.  This is strongest in Katniss, who knows how to hunt and fight for herself, but knows little of love and caring for those other than her family, and yet in the Hunger Games sometimes you must make allies to survive, at a cost, for eventually you will have to kill your ally.      The Hunger Games will have you on the edge of your seat, flipping the pages, but also wanting to read slowly and savor the incredible story, and at the end you'll be somewhat annoyed by the abrupt ending.  Have no fear, the sequel, Catching Fire, will be out September 1st, while Collins continues work on the third book in the series.    [...]
B002SJIO5E|5.0|District 9 is a refreshing break from the slew of mediocre big-budget sci-fi action flicks produced by Hollywood every year. Made on a tiny budget of $30 million by South African director Neill Blomkamp, it's amazing what he and his crew have been able to accomplish for so little money (comparatively speaking). The story is tightly woven and wonderfully acted by Sharlto Copley, a South African actor who plays the protagonist, Wikus van de Merwe. Blomkamp knows that the story drives a film, not the CG. The CG aids the storytelling, but shouldn't take center stage, something that many of the $150+ million Hollywood CG stinkers forget (ahem... [[ASIN:B002NXSRX4 G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra]], [[ASIN:B001KZIRM2 Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]). In D9, the CG (provided by Vancouver-based SFX house Image Engine) is perfectly blended into the environments and feels natural and realistic. It never sticks out or takes you out of the sense of immersion.<br /><br />The story is about an alien ship that came to Earth 20 years ago and stopped over Johannesburg, South Africa. There it stayed motionless until the government sent in cutters to open up the ship, where they found a race of cricket-like beings huddled in squalid conditions. Leaderless, malnourished, and numbering over one million, they are given refuge on Earth and confined to slums on the outskirts of the city. Rife with crime, poverty, and violence, District 9 is policed by a private military contractor called MNU (Multinational United) and controlled by a profiteering Nigerian warlord/illegal arms dealer and his thugs. At the beginning of the film, Wikus, whose doofy appearance and demeanor is reminiscent of a young [[ASIN:B0009IW8OE Peter Sellers]], is tasked with evicting the alien residents of District 9 and relocating them to another settlement. During a search for contraband, without giving away too much of the plot, Wikus makes a discovery that changes his life, turning him from an MNU agent into a reluctant hero.<br /><br />Visually, the film has a very coarse look. As widely publicized, the story is based on South Africa's struggle with apartheid, and was filmed in an actual township in Soweto to give the film a dirty and gritty sense of authenticity, using handheld Red digital cameras to heighten the documentary feel. The story is smartly written and the themes of corporate greed, racism/xenophobia, poverty, and corruption are not hard to believe. Replace the alien refugees with humans and you can find this kind of squalor in many parts of the developing world, like we saw in [[ASIN:B001P9KR94 Slumdog Millionaire]] (India) or [[ASIN:B0000D9PNX City of God]] (Brazil). Crime in South Africa is rampant and it's one of the most dangerous places on Earth in real life. Some of the alien weaponry is very cool and people explode like watermelons. Limbs get severed and there is a good amount of violence and gore in the film, so be forewarned if you are sensitive to such imagery. The climactic showdown at the end is also very exciting and well done.<br /><br />Stated influences for the film include the Alien and Terminator series, Robocop, Predator, and others, so if you enjoyed these films, you'll probably enjoy D9. Highly recommended for the sci-fi fan.o.    Visually, the film has a very coarse look.

B001GCUO1Q|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. it was a bit odd to see Professor Xavier walking. I thought he would have been in a wheelchair in this movie. it was a bit odd to see Cyclops going to school as a teen and Gambit on here as well. this movie has tons of action. Hugh Jackman reprises his role as Wolverine, who was a Weapon X. it is hard to imagine, through all the X-Men cartoons I watched in my 20's, that Wolverine and Sabretooth grew up as half-brothers. there were some funny parts in this movie, such as Fred \\"Blob\\" Dukes boxing with Wolverine, however, eventually, it is the Blob that gets knocked down. I am really surprised that Magneto and Mystique were not in this movie. I recommend this movie to X-Men fans.
B0017HMF6W|1.0|This new Blu-Ray of \\"North by Northwest\\" is actually worse than the standard DVD.  It is far too dark. Grant's face becomes uglily brown. Generally skin tones are disastrous.  furthermore the famous VistaVision high definition (equivalent to 70mm) which we should expect to excel on Blu-Ray is nowhere to be seen.  The effect is that the light charm and the beauty of the film have disappeared. It has become heavy and ugly, something it never was before.   How can those who are responsible ruin such an important film while promising to improve on DVD?  The old DVD was slightly too light but it was not ugly and its definition was much as we see in the Blu-Ray. Clearly Warners have simply transfered the master of the old DVD (which was indeed good) to Blu-Ray without going back to the  celluloid master (a pointless exercise if you are making a Blu-Ray from VistaVision) and then they overdid the darkening. They must put unqualified people in charge of these crucial tasks.  This travesty of a masterpiece has been produced to exploit the Christmas market. I shall stow my copy and carry on with the old standard DVD.  yours sincerely,  Charles Rees
0385532458|1.0|Until John Grishman joins the 21st century and allows eBooks, I will never buy another one of this works.  Yes, there are those who don't like eBooks, and will only want the real paper copy.  But there are many, growing every month, who are moving to eBooks, and really love the convenience.  Why John Grisham can't figure this out is beyond me.  Course, if he continues to write these silly short stories that take no effort, then I'm thinking his days are numbered.  By the way, John Grisham used to be my all-time favorite author - a title I'm sure he's had for many people, and unfortunately, a title which is being replaced.
B002HWRZH0|4.0|This movie was great in the theatres, and I'm sure seeing this in blu-ray will be awesome as well and all the extra clips and features provided by the extra disc will be fun to watch, but let's get real, the only reason any of us bought this particular \\"Limited Edition\\" \\"Amazon Exclusive\\" Replica Gift Set was for the little metal ship.      The little Enterprise is very nice looking, substantial and heavy for it's size (no cheap piece of plastic on this baby), and worthy to put in a display case, BUT: 1) On closer inspection, craftsmenship is not perfect, though not flimsy, there is a small gap between where the saucer attaches to the \\"neck\\" (sorry, don't know what else to call that part) of the ship, in other words it is not completely seamless; 2) The certificate is NOT indiviudally signed, just copied/printed signatures; and 3) It is NOT numbered (either on the sculpture itself or on the certificate).  How the heck do I know for sure there's not 10,000 of these ships flying around?  Particularly considering since it had appeared to sell out, but then pops back up for sale (though $9 more than before).    Bottom line: Great Movie, but whether or not paying an extra $70 to $80 bucks for this trophy ship on top of the regular 3-Disc Blu-ray set, depends on how much of a Star Trek \\"Geek\\" you really are ;)
B0029LHX1W|2.0|I was excited about reading this book for a while.  The staging of a murder mystery inside Soviet Russia seemed a winning idea; however, about two-thirds into the book, it transformed into a typical episode of \\"Criminal Minds,\\" with an ending that felt both implausable and tired.    On the positive side, Tim Rob Smith's writing style is very gripping.  His prose and descriptions of the feelings of his characters were believable and clear.  In addition, the initial focus on Stalinist governmental procedure was interesting and shed a new light on the typical police procedural.    Unfortunately, the problem came later.  With about 100 or so pages to go, the reader can ultimately discover the identity of the murderer, and in my case, be completely disappointed with the route the author took.  Without giving too much away, Smith's choice was too familiar, and to me negated the new ground he covered in the beginning of the book.    While I definitely understand the book's appeal, I was frustrated the author chose not to formulate a surprising and believable ending, but rather underwhelmed with an easy out and lackluster motive for the story's antagonist.
B002QW7AJY|1.0|What a ripoff!  And the American public, presumably will pay these high prices?  I can see a BlueRay DVD costing a couple of bucks more, but beyond that, there is no reason on earth it should cost more.  This is no longer brand new technology, and the economy of mass scale production is already in force.  Notice how BlueRays are being \\"blown out\\" at sale prices?  Well, keep resisting these high prices and they come down further!  What a RIPOFF!      Oh, yes, all the positive's relating to the story are all true......just wait for the standard DVD to come out, but at a LOW price, and then watch it on an upscaling DVD player....good enough.....or rent it if you can't wait.  Just don't give Hollywood and its video brokers this kind of money.  What a RIPOFF!
0743277708|4.0|Watership Down is simply a good story to be enjoyed. Is it the best adventure story every written? no. Does it change the world? no.

This book makes you want to read more books to experience more of the magic that only reading can provide.
B002T9H2LK|5.0|\\"Inglourious Basterds,\\" directed by Quentin Tarantino, is about World War II, the SS, a band of relentless Nazi killers, movie star spies, and a German war hero, among other things.  It is a rich film in many ways:  plot, star power, performances, photography, film references, and dark humor.  Defying traditional compartmentalization, it offers an intriguing, textured story, action, and nice helpings of satire.  In short, \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" is a feast for movie lovers.    Several stories that will eventually merge unfold separately.    In Nazi-occupied France, SS officer Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), accompanied by several soldiers, comes to a farmhouse in search of Jews who may be hiding there.  He is impeccably uniformed, intimidating, yet polite, even deferential as he speaks with the nervous farmer (Denis Menochet).  Landa questions the farmer  slowly, quietly, yet conveys menace in every syllable.    We then switch to Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), in charge of a unit of Jewish-American soldiers whose mission is to instill fear in the German military by brutally killing Nazis and scalping them.    Finally, we are introduced to Shosanna (Melanie Laurent), who owns and operates a Paris cinema.  A German officer, Frederick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), sees her and is immediately attracted to her, but she rebuffs his advances until she learns he is a celebrated war hero.    Tarantino divides the movie into chapters, taking time to establish characters and make them more than rehashes of previous war movie types.  This is done largely through dialogue, one of Mr. Tarantino's fortes.  Two scenes come to mind.  In one, a group of German soldiers has been attacked by Raine's team.  Many of the Germans have been killed and Raine is questioning their commanding officer about German military installations in the region.  Raine's interview consists of introducing his men and their various unpleasant specialties, and playing a mind game with the officer.  The goal:  finding outwhere the Germans are entrenched.  The threat:  if you don't reveal this information, there will be severe consequences for you, and they aren't exactly listed in the Geneva Conventions.    A second outstanding dialogue sequence is the aforementioned conversation in the farmhouse between the SS officer and the farmer.  From the outset, we mistrust the oily charm of Landa and we know his mission is more than merely asking a few questions and going on his way.  As he speaks calmly in metaphors, we understand his dark intention, ruthless proficiency, and pride in how well he does his job.  The cuts to the soldiers standing outside and various close-ups of the farmer amplify our dread that something awful is imminent.      This takes us to the performance by Christoph Waltz, an obscure Austrian actor who undoubtedly undertakes his greatest role ever as the multifaceted, multilingual Landa.  Mr. Waltz understands this character perfectly.  Landa refers to himself as a detective, a Teutonic Sherlock Holmes, though those in the area have given him the nickname \\"The Jew Hunter.\\"  Waltz takes his time with his dialogue, very much like a kind uncle speaking to a child.  He smiles, laughs a bit, smokes a pipe, gives compliments, and is always courteous to a fault.  That is, until he bares his claws and pounces.  Mr. Waltz is so perfect as Landa, so memorable, that an Oscar nomination is assured.  He adds tremendous stature to \\"Inglourious Basterds.\\"    Brad Pitt's Raine -- a reference to the 1950's actor Aldo Ray, who appeared in many war movies -- is in charge of committing horrible acts, yet because it is wartime and his subjects are the genocidal Nazis, we like him.  Pitt adopts a Tennessee drawl for Raine, which is funny, though the character itself never crosses over into caricature.  None of Tarantino's characters do.      Shosanna, who becomes important in the film's third act, has a past that makes her a particularly fierce anti-Nazi, though her feelings must be suppressed until the time is exactly right to reveal them.  Ms. Laurent is attractive, but her role -- despite its importance -- is not as showy as the others.  Her story is a framing device, in a sense, for the entire movie.      Mr. Bruhl as Zoller is effective as the golden boy of Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels (Sylvester Groth).  His flirtations with Shosanna are initially innocent and charming, but his persistence leads to dire complications.  Diane Kruger turns in an elegant performance as Bridget von Hammersmark, darling of Third Reich cinema.  Beautiful, sophisticated, talented, and widely popular in Germany, Bridget plays a crucial role in an intricate plot.  A scene between Bridget and Col. Landa darkly mirrors a climactic moment in \\"Cinderella,\\" in another neat Tarantino touch.       Blending the three stories smoothly showcases the artistry of Tarantino the writer.  Nothing seems out of place or contrived.  Mulling over the movie afterwards, the viewer may come up with some inconsistencies or flaws, but while the movie is unreeling, our attention is riveted.  Tarantino has mastered the technique of placing what's important to his story in the foreground and banishing bothersome details.  If you're like me, you will be surprised at the movie's finale, something I simply didn't see coming.  For Tarantino's tale, however, it's a smooth, appropriate fit.    Rated R for violence and language, \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" ranks among Quentin Tarantino's best films.  In style and substance, it most closely resembles \\"Pulp Fiction.\\"  What you have here is a Class A script with an A-list cast.  As a person sensitive to overly long movies, I can tell you that the two-and-a-half-hour running time flies by.  If anything, I wanted more.
B0010358D0|4.0|Appleseed Ex Machina is the sequel to the 2004 Appleseed film that was directed by Shinji Aramaki.  It continues the story of Deunan and Briareos, and also introduces a couple of new characters (Tereus and Aeacus).<br /><br />The languages menu for the Appleseed Ex Machina DVD is a little on the frustrating side.  It is done in such a way that the language option for each country is written in that respective country's language.  Unfortunately, this means that the Japanese and Chinese options are written with the Japanese and Chinese characters.  If you want to choose either of those as a language option, you have to have some familiarity with the written characters.  Also, after you choose the language, you are automatically returned to the main menu.  In order to indicate that you want subtitles, you have to return to the languages menu and choose the subtitles.<br /><br />The regular release of Appleseed Ex Machina also has two short documentaries on it.  The first is \\"Team Up: John Woo and Shinji Aramaki.\\"  This runs for about sixteen and a half minutes, and through interviews with Shinji Aramaki, crew members, and anime journalists, you find out what each of these individuals brought to Appleseed Ex Machina.  The other documentary is \\"Revolution: Animating Ex Machina.\\"  This runs for about eighteen and a half minutes, and it talks about how the animation was done for the film, and it also delves a little bit into the English dubbing for the project.  The trailers feature only includes two anime-related trailers (both of which are for the live-action version of Speed Racer).  There is also an audio commentary.<br /><br />There was also a two-disc special edition version released for Appleseed Ex Machina.  The second disc includes two documentaries.  The first is \\"The Appleseed Chronicles.\\"  It runs for about twenty minutes, and goes into the history of the Appleseed manga.  Personally, I was a little disappointed that this feature never touched on the 1988 OVA version of Appleseed or the 2004 Appleseed film directed by Shinji Aramaki.  The other documentary is \\"East Meets West,\\" and it runs for about eighteen and a half minutes.  This feature talks about how anime crossed over into the west, and how various terms and ideas involved with anime have been cross-pollinated between the Japanese and American cultures.<br /><br />In my opinion, Appleseed Ex Machina was a strong follow-up to the Appleseed film.  The computer animation used in this film is even better than in the first film, and there are some shots and sequences where you truly feel like you're watching a live-action film.<br /><br />Appleseed Ex Machina is a PG-13 rated film.  It's a violent film, so I really wouldn't recommend it for young children.  However, if you're a fan of the first Appleseed movie, you won't be disappointed by Appleseed Ex Machina.  It's a DVD that should be in the anime library of anyone who considers themselves a fan of Appleseed.he 2004 Appleseed film directed by Shinji Aramaki.

However, I needed something with more dynamic range.  This model was suggested independently by two friends, each fellow musicians.  Their recommendations were spot-on.  This set is amazing.  Upon first-listen, my jaw was on the floor listening to the difference in my audio mixes.  I'm sure this set will hold up nicely if it behaves like my previous Sony set.  Get them.  You will love the results.
B000M2E43U|4.0|The music is great. The one thing I found disappointing was that the intro to some of Michael's songs are not there. For example, if you listen to THRILLER off Michael's THRILLER album, there is an intro that builds up to the main song. The NUMBER ONES CD is lacking due to some of the intros missing. To me the intros to the songs are very important. The songs are just not the same without them. I still like the CD though.
0385504225|2.0|I agree with many other reviewers that this book was written as a screenplay, complete with visions of Tom Hanks. The writing and editing wouldn't pass college freshman English muster and all those \\"ahah\\" moments were simply annoying. Such a disappointment after Brown's last two big sellers. Robert Langdon must have lost a few brain cells in that chamber....not to figure out the Lost Word himself many chapters earlier. My last word on this story.
0345457684|2.0|Slow. Ponderous pacing. One dimensional characters. And one intriguing idea (resleeving).  Too bad most of the atmosphere is a redo from PD (as are some of the character ideas).  Easily twice as long as needed to play out the plot. I was disappointed in the whole mesh-mash given the level of adoration this book garners.  I hope the forthcoming movie does more with the book that the author did.    BTW - I got about 300 pages through and couldn't finish it. Real glad I got it from the library!

B00005ASGG|5.0|All I need to say is, this is one of the many great classic westerns. Jimmy Stewart has always been a great actor, I especially loved him in westerns, his slow drawl when speaking is what drew me to him in the first place. There are no more actors like him.

0764203886|5.0|\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.<br /><br />And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.<br /><br />The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.<br /><br />A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.<br /><br />And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...<br /><br />Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).<br /><br />The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.<br /><br />But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").<br /><br />It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.<br /><br />It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read.ongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love.

B001LF4ARC|4.0|The author compiled his material from public media as he did not have access to Steve Jobs.  If you have followed Jobs career closely this book may not offer many new insights.  On the other hand, if you have not this book is a treat.  The author has followed Apple closely.  He has already written [[ASIN:1593271220 The Cult of Mac]], [[ASIN:1593270666 The Cult of iPod]] and covered Apple as a journalist for 12 years.<br /><br />Jobs thinks differently from any other CEOs.  He is primarily focused on design and  simplicity of products.  Everything he does is original from the iPod to today's network of Apple stores.  Jobs is obsessed about packaging and advertising that most other CEOs ignore.<br /><br />Jobs is a paradox.  He is known to be the most charming person one minute and the number one bully the next.  Also, he manages Apple as the archetypal micromanager from hell.  However, he manages Pixar as a hands off manner.  And, he is equally successful in both ventures.  At Apple, he has created the most innovative environment within the hi-tech industry.  But, it is a pressure cooker.  Burn outs and firings are common.  Somehow, Jobs keeps attracting top talent to revive innovation and keep Apple way ahead of the PC industry.<br /><br />Pixar is a different story.  There Jobs has created a unique nurturing environment unlike the cut-throat short term contract model of the movie business.  Pixar programmers, designers, story tellers, and directors are long term employees.  Their livelihood is secure.  Their creativity is unbound and is 100% retained by Pixar.  This is a huge competitive advantage.  As a result, they have a 10 year lead in animation technology.<br /><br />Despite the huge differences between Apple and Pixar, there is one area where Apple is like Pixar.  This is design.  Apple outsources a lot of the manufacturing and assembling but not the design.  Jobs treats design as the number one proprietary competitive edge of Apple.  It is managed by one of the best industrial designer, Jonathan Ives.  Similar to Pixar, the Apple's design team is closely knit and has a very long tenure at the company.<br /><br />When Joseph Schumpeter, an Austrian economist, came up with his concept of \\"creative destruction\\" as explained in [[ASIN:0061561614 Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy]] first published in 1942, he must have anticipated Steve Jobs rising.  Indeed, Jobs is a top creative destroyer.  Think of what he did to the movie business (Pixar), the music business (iTunes, iPod), the smart cell phone business (iPhone with apps store).  In each cases, he has taken those industry apart and created new business models.<br /><br />The author explains why Apple has been a closed system for so long.  It insures robustness, compatibility, and ease of use that Microsoft will never match.  Microsoft has to work out compatibility with so many different PC manufacturers and peripheral companies, it is a losing battle.  Today, Apple is more open.  The inner components of its PCs are increasingly interchangeable with Windows PCs.  But, the difference is that Apple develops its own operating system that serves only its own hardware.  Also, Apple's vertical integration allows it to seamlessly develop digital ecosystems.  Everything works with everything else, the hardware, the software, the digital interface.  That's why no one can readily compete with the iPod or the iPhone.  To take on those products you first have to develop the counterpart to iTunes and the special apps stores.  That's so far too tall an order.<br /><br />With all of those achievements, Jobs has no college degree and is not an engineer or a programmer.  The author suggests his lack of hi tech skills is a competitive advantage.  He does not think like a programmer or an engineer.  He does not know what is impossible.  So, he barges through barriers others would consider terminal constraints.  In every product Apple delivered, he had to challenge his engineers and programmers who told him certain features were just impossible... maybe not...  not for Steve!es were just impossible... maybe not...  not for Steve!
0882709194|5.0|Ray Comfort poses simple ideas and questions that everyone can at least grasp or identify, and speaks well.  I have liked this book so far, and as I read Origin of Species I find that there are some interesting points (yet inconclusively derived) from Charles Darwin.    I'm sure that this review will get burried in the the tomes of the 'atheists' slurring comments; however, I have two problems with all their mindless drivel.    1) Most have not even read the 'dreaded' introduction, they are just parroting or blindly obeying their supreme leader \\"Richard Dawkins\\" who address a group telling them to simply \\"rip out the first 50 pages.\\"    2) The second problem is that to those objecting to this book, most do so not based open simple authorship but quite possibly by 'blind devotion' to the 'theory' that most supports their world view--that they are their own gods and cannot possible believe in God or a supreme creator or else there might be consequences to their actions on an eternal scale.  Now those are my words \\"and opinions\\" and I'm sure there will be follow-up comments on even this sub-point.    Strictly from the content of this book, I DID get to read through the introduction and am reading through \\"one man's THEORY\\" of the Origin of Species.    I found Ray Comfort's ideas interesting, and while not scientifically in depth, I believe that you can take some of his ideas and research them against the backdrop of Origin of Species.  Aren't we always supposed to ask legitimate questions on theories?  Doesn't the scientific methods and hypothesis analysis always state that you take something to be \\"null\\" or false until proven true through reasonable data or demonstration--same holding true with Evolution as it would with Creation?    I will not blindly follow after Creation--I constantly look and seek out truth about the 'Creator'; likewise, I don't say evolution has to be true and the most \\"scientific theory\\" because the alternative is 'moronic'; thereby, blinding following another theory.    I submit to the potential buyer that we can all be respectful of others views without having to slander, slur, or speak evil of another.  IF anything it is the spiteful, and venemous methods that some of these 'reviewers' have used that puts me off to their way of thinking, and drives me and maybe you, to further seek truth and objectivity from rational and level minded people.      Start here, and then for another 'creation/intelligent design' objective book look at \\"Case for a Creator\\" by Lee Strobel--in the footnotes to his book, he sites many other texts that give good information and pose interesting questions.  The pro-evolution books are easy to find as they seem to \\"update\\" quite often.

1401323820|4.0|I really enjoyed Andrew Marlowe's novelization of his show's characters and the fact that he relieves the sexual tension between the female detective and the writer in a way that could only be revealed through \\"fiction.\\"  If Castle and Beckett were to succumb to their hidden urges it would make their working relationship impossible (and would damage the series).  But it does explain why Beckett is so ticked off by Castle's literary version of her.  Nikki Heat can say and do things that Beckett can only fantasize about.     I enjoyed the novel very much and was not bothered in the least by its brevity. In addition to knowing the characters from the series, Marlowe excels in bringing \\"Castle's\\" fictional characters vividly to life with a minimum of words.    My favorite thing about the novel is that the writer clearly knows New York City well and, references to fictional restaurants and other businesses aside, the location details are highly accurate.    Regarding the \\"ghost writer,\\" as mentioned on the acknowledgement page, the author's \\"partner in crime,\\" is Terri Miller, Marlowe's wife, the show's co-producer and the scriptwriter of the excellent Halloween episode.  It seems unlikely that another writer would call Marlowe's wife his \\"partner in crime.\\"
1416914285|3.0|Although the stories seem very different at first glance, City of Bones reminded me very much of the Harry Potter books.  Clary Fray grows up with no knowledge of demons, Shadowhunters, werewolves, vampires, or other fairy creatures.  She also believes that she knows her own history.  She is then introduced to another world that coexists alongside our mundane (Muggle) world.  Learning about this world and her past is a large part of the book, as it is for Harry in the Harry Potter series.  We also have a bad guy, Valentine, who had loyal followers, the Circle, and who is believed to bed dead.  Remind you of Voldemort and the Deatheaters?  Even some of the names in the book struck me as similar to names of characters in the Harry Potter series.<br /><br />I think the author also tried to do too much in this first volume of the series.  There is a lot of information to process and too many story lines for a single book.  The writing could have also been tightened up in places.<br /><br />With all of that said, I did enjoy the book and it was a fairly fast read for me.  Once I noticed the similarities to Harry Potter I started watching for them and was picking the book apart a bit more than I normally would have.  I am planning to read the next book in the series to see if the similarities continue or if the author can take the series in its own direction.
B001PO53IO|4.0|First of all, I should say I LOVE this series.  There is nothing like it on TV, and once again Star Wars is breaking new ground.  The show is quality.  It can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike.  The graphic design of the settings and characters is beautiful, and the story lines are thoughtful  and interesting.  As an added bonus, you get to see some characters and species from the Star Wars universe come to life.  I particularly enjoyed seeing the IG-88-type assassin droids in action and Aurra Sing in one episode.<br /><br />As a lot of reviewers have said, the Blu-Ray format is a must here.  Simply dazzling.<br /><br />Now comes the \\"BUT...\\"  There were a few things that I think could be improved upon.<br /><br />3D animation: The movement of the characters is not always fluid or natural-looking.  I think they claim to have improved upon this for Season 2.  Some of the lip-syncing doesn't look particularly great, either.  I have seen some examples of improvement in this arena in Season 2, as well.  In at least one episode, I spotted a glaring rendering error in which you could see through Padme's head from the back.  I was amazed the error wasn't caught and corrected.<br /><br />Writing:  A couple episodes dragged a little.  There were also a few plot holes, such as Anakin and Obi-Wan cleverly swapping away their drugged drinks at the end of one episode, but then finding themselves waking from a drugged coma in a holding cell at the beginning of the next episode.  Did I miss something???<br /><br />Voice acting: Some of the character voices sounded like they were done by real amateurs.  Ahmed Best played Jar-Jar in one episode, and then in the next Jar-Jar episode it sounded like they pulled someone in off the street.  I swear, I can do a better Jar-Jar impersonation than the person who played him in the \\"Gungan General\\" episode.  I should mention that the actor who did the clone voices was exceptional.  He modified the voice ever so slightly from clone to clone, so they don't all sound exactly alike.<br /><br />Annoying/campy characters:  I didn't hate Jar-Jar as much as everyone else in the prequels.  Sure, he was a bumbling idiot, but his bumbling usually ended up accidentally generating positive results.  I could overlook that.  The Clone Wars will make you HATE Jar-Jar if you don't already.  His goofiness ends up destroying ships, killing a senator, and costing the Republic victory on several occasions.  You have to ask yourself, \\"WHY ON EARTH would you bring him along anywhere???\\"  Throw him in prison, and the Republic can win the war in a week.<br /><br />The spinning flying-saucer ship of the pirates and the cliche evil scientist/mad doctor were just a couple examples of George Lucas getting a little too nostalgic for Saturday morning serials at the expense of this series.<br /><br />I think all of these flaws can be excused and remedied as the series progresses.  Overall, the show is beautiful and brilliant.  Can't wait to see more.Annoying/campy characters:  I didn't hate Jar-Jar as much as everyone else in the prequels.

B002RSDW80|3.0|Well, I guess it's finally happened...the consumer and film buff who does not own a Blue-Ray compatible DVD player is now officially SOL. The standard DVD release of Julie and Julia contains as special features only a commentary track and behind-the-scenes featurette.  To get the full array of special features, one must purchase the Blue-Ray version of the film, AND of course, a Blue-Ray dvd player.  Here are the features NOT available on the standard dvd:  tour of Julia Child's kitchen in the Smithsonian; featurette \\"Friends and Family Remember Julia Child;\\" and \\"Cooking Lessons,\\" with Julia Child, Jacques Pepin, and other renowned chefs preparing several of Julia Child's best-loved dishes.  Why can't the studio release a two-disc special edition in the standard format for consumers like me who don't own the latest home entertainment equipment? I loved the film (especially The Divine Ms. Streep), loved Julia Child's book \\"My Life in France,\\" very much liked Julie Powell's book \\"J & J,\\" and can't tell you how much I've been looking forward to owning the DVD.  I'm miffed, and in no position to go out and buy myself a new DVD player in this economy, not even at Christmas. This really stinks. So, five stars for the film itself, no stars for the DVD release manipulation.

The D&D 3.5e ruleset was too problematic, too broken, too unbalanced, too old, and really needed a reboot.  My buddies and I gave [[ASIN:078695552X 4th Edition D&D]] a long try, and we decided that a) it wasn't D&D b) it had some great ideas but limited the PCs too much, and c) it ultimately became a fun-less grindfest which made everyone miserable.<br /><br />We were all heartbroken and gave up, instead turning to [[ASIN:0786943564 Star Wars Saga Edition]], which is fun but has its own laundry list of problems. (But hey--it is Star Wars!)<br /><br />We tried Pathfinder at GenCon2009 and we completely love it.  We play every week over the internet using Ventrilo and D20Pro.  We thoroughly enjoy the revamp to familiar rules that actually makes D&D fun again and provides balance while making the characters fun & powerful without being munchkin-y.  The published modules are a complete joy as well.
B00005KB9R|5.0|This is a wonderful album and absolute perfection from beginning to end and the extra tracks are a nice addition as well.  The original Wailers were such an influential band and one of the precious few who while changing the music scene also managed to change culture as a whole.  I've always thought Mr. Marley was the truest poet in music due to the fact that he lived every song he ever wrote as did his primary co-songwriters, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer.  Their music and lyrical content stired up revolution both in their country, in music and in the hearts and minds of people around the globe.  This is one band that still generates a tremendous buzz today years after the release of this fantastic album.<br /><br />They weren't the first to write, produce & perform reggae (Music of the Islands) but they did bring a cohesiveness to their genre and showed that, by this time, it had matured into a force just like the other top genre's of the day.  The Wailers also were able to seemlessly blend aspects from R&B, Jazz, Gospel and Blues bringing a different and unique flavor.  The Wailers, along with Jimmy Cliff, were truly the 1st to make us stand up and pay attention to Reggae and what it would soon mean on a world wide scale!  I recenly ran across an online poll that asked a simply yet profound question. \\"Who was more influential: Bob Marley or John Lennon?\\"  There were a variety of opinons one way or the other, as you would expect, and the debate got somewhat heated.  However, the final response given by a participant on the forum was one of the most profound I've heard on the subject and I think sums everything up in a nutshell.<br /><br />He stated about the two artists in question: \\"One wrote and performed a lot of hit songs, ended a war single handedly, and is looked at to some in Africa as the second coming.\\"  \\"The other wrote and performed a lot of hit songs, Enough Said!\\"  I couldn't have said it any better myself and that is the difference between The Wailers and every other band of any influence, their songs touched people on a level that made them want to get up, stand up and fight for their rights, not just sing, dance, go to parties, etc.  There's nothing necessarily wrong with the latter, however, it's the former that truly makes a difference in the direction of a people and nation.<br /><br />Listening to this CD really took me back to that first moment when I heard this album.  Putting needle to wax and hearing \\"Get Up, Stand Up, Stand Up for your rights!\\" come shouting through my speakers absolutely sent chills down my spine.  Understand the time frame, this was 1973 and the Civil Rights/Black Power movements were still raging in the U.S., to hear a band sing a song like that was so mind boggling to my young ears.  Radio stations weren't prone to play such revolutionary themes at the time and especially from a genre that was just making a name for itself on a worldwide scale.  Then you had the sweet and angelic sounds of Bunny Wailer's \\"Hallelujah Time\\" with it's wonderful bass guitar and clavinet intro.  This song is so powerful in that it reminds you of the beauty of the simple things in life in the midst of such gross oppression.<br /><br />Then you have the ultimate song of rebellion and revolution, a song that would become an anthem of both Reggae & Revolutions around the globe, Bob Marley's masterpiece \\"I Shot The Sheriff.\\"  What can be said about this song that has not already been stated millions of times over.  It has so many layers and displays Marley's incredible mastery of writing and storytelling using allegories and metaphors.  At the same time it's a song about an individual and a nation of people defending their right to live in peace according to their beliefs & fighting against genocide of a \\"seed\\" planted.<br /><br />There's a wonderful interplay of songs as Reggae is music of what I call equal opposites.  This is displayed constantly in the writings of Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer.From songs like \\"Burnin' and Lootin'\\" to \\"Put It On\\" and \\"Duppy Conqueror\\" to \\"Reincarnated Souls.\\"  All 3 men were able to, at the same time, be revolutionary and spiritual, fighers and lovers, Rastafarians and Rebels as they saw one as the other and all inclusive.  The songs they wrote were both complex yet simple, deep with practial meanings and applications for everyday life for everyday people.<br /><br />Just like there's a postive for a negative and an up for a down a left for a right, Reggae music deals with the entire spectrum of life.  This music is so very deep and personal, it truly gives you a glimpse as to what it was like in Jamaica back in the time The Wailers first formed and the strife and struggles they had to go through and not just there but in all the Island nations and anywhere were those of African descent were living around the world.  This was the music that changed generational perspectives and was, then and now, adored by millions and millions of people around the world.<br /><br />When you have fans as varied as the Freedom Fighers from both South Africa & Zimbabwe, The Hopi & Havasupai Indians of the Southwest U.S.A, The Maoris of New Zealand & even the United Nations, there's really not much to argue about concerning how broad and vast your influence has become. In India, there are many tributes to Bob Marley to this day including restaurants, hotels, and cultural festivals. There has never been anything like Bob Marley & The Wailers and we won't ever see their likes again.From songs like \\"Burnin' and Lootin'\\" to \\"Put It On\\" and \\"Duppy Conqueror\\" to \\"Reincarnated Souls.\\"  All 3 men were able to, at the same time, be revolutionary and spiritual, fighers and lovers, Rastafarians and Rebels as they saw one as the other and all inclusive.

B001992NUQ|5.0|Fight Club is an absolute masterpiece of American cinema.  For those who have only seen this movie once or twice, some of you might have missed a couple of brilliant moments in the movie:    (1) Brad Pitt or some brief half-second collages of him appear in a few scenes before he makes his proper entrance in the movie (the plane scene with Norton).  Think of the storyline, and you'd understand that's done for a very good reason.  Ingenious.    (2) The very last second before the movie ends.  Yes, the very last second of the falling skyscrapers scene.  Watch it again if you have missed it.  It echoes with something Tyler said earlier in the movie.  Fascinatingly cunning.

0553284347|5.0|This is a well written book that I had a hard time putting down.  The author uses actual cases to illustrate her points.  The first half of the book identifies different types of toxic parents and the relationship the children develop with them and why.  The second half of the book goes into how to come to terms with the person your parent(s) is, and how you can work to change your reaction to the way your toxic parents programed your childhood brain.  Highly recommended.

B001AVCFJM|5.0|I went into the theater, expecting this crew to totally destroy the legacy of the original Star Trek universe. However, I was quite pleasantly surprised. In fact, I was blown away by how well they did things. The characters all act as how one would have pictured the original cast to act if they were that young before the original series started.<br /><br />Of course, there were changes. The fact that they reworked the history of Vulcan will surely upset some people, but to me, it was nothing that can't be fixed in a sequel. The other twist was the love story between two of the most unlikely characters, if the original series is to be taken into account. However, I think they did it well.<br /><br />This was truly an enjoyable remake and the cast, plot, and action were dead on.<br /><br />My personal favorite, Scotty, was performed with great skill by my favorite Shaun of the Dead, Simon Pegg. Plus, second time around, it finally dawned on me who Kirk's mother was played by, none other than Jennifer Morrison, formerly of House.<br /><br />Unless you are hardcore into the minute details of the original, I highly recommended this movie.

0739499963|5.0|The Lucky One by Nicholas Sparks<br /><br />In this Nicholas Sparks novel, we find Logan Thibault, a former Marine stationed in Iraq, who survives three tours all because of a photograph of a beautiful young woman he finds in the sand in Iraq. He posts the photograph on a bulletin board, but the photo is never taken.  His best friend Victor keeps telling him the photograph is a good luck charm, even though Logan scoffs at this notion.  A few years after returning from the war, he sets out to find the woman in the photograph, walking all the way with his wonderful companion, a German Shepherd named Zeus.  He finds the woman in a place called Hampton, South Carolina, where he finds Elizabeth.<br /><br />Elizabeth, along with her grandmother, who raised her, owns and runs a Kennel and Obedience Class for Dogs.  Logan is immediately hired by Nana, but Elizabeth is suscpicious of Logan, as he doesn't talk much about his past and she's been very leery of men, esp. since her divorce from Keith, who comes from a very powerful family in town.  When she finds her ten year old son Ben friends with Logan and Zeus, she starts finding she likes him more and more.<br /><br />When Logan begins to wonder why he's been on a journey to find Elizabeth, he learns quite suddenly just how much destiny can play a part in changing our lives.  When Logan finds evidence of a break-in in his home, he knows who and why and works to resolve the problem before it causes their lives to be changed forever. It takes an accident for Logan, Elizabeth, Ben and Keith to realize just how important a life is. I have read most of Nicholas's books and really loved this story.

B000NOQDOA|1.0|It's a great concept, but the plastic items are too fragile and brake easily.  The worst of all is that they don't sell only the parts.  Avoid buying this product.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|I'm really loving this album. I loved their first one, and love this one just as much, if not more. Each and every song is an extraordinary musical experience. To get the full effect of the album though, it really helps to listen to it all in sequence. Each song helps strengthen the others. It's almost like a live show more than a CD. Awesome job OneRepublic!!!
B000000W6F|5.0|I notice from these reviews that there are very few people who can interpret and therefore appreciate this album to it's very depth, and the reason is because we are Westerners instead of Easterners. Were the lyrics translated and heard in India or other places in Asia, there would be very little mystery. This album is about Spiritual Enlightenment (Salvation, Nirvana, Liberation) which is the topic of topics; the goal of goals. Corgan directly says that this is a \\"very spiritual album\\" and even mentions that it's about spiritual ascension, the songs Siva (Shiva) and Suffer being giveaways. Recently in an interview, he mentioned that in his past albums he was \\"intellectualizing the divine.\\" This album comes from Corgans own suffering and his efforts to understand and walk the road to the divine. This is easily the most profound SP album due to it's complexity, depth and relevance, making it one of the most significant albums of all time.    I believe Corgan was reading I Am That by Nisargadatta during the time. He is an Indian liberated man, a concept which few people in the West are familiar with. In the song Siva, Corgan writes: \\"All this pain smothers me, like a bomb that you can't see. Tell me, tell me what you're after. I just want to get there faster.\\" In the book, Nisargadatta is talking to a visitor who tells him, \\"Basically, man is afraid. He is afraid of himself most. I feel I am like a man who is carrying a bomb that is going to explode. He cannot defuse it, he cannot throw it away. He is terribly frightened and is searching frantically for a solution, which he cannot find. To me liberation is getting rid of this bomb. I do not know much about the bomb. I only know that it comes from early childhood. I feel like the frightened child protesting passionately against not being loved. The child is craving for love and because he does not get it, he is afraid and angry. Sometimes I feel like killing somebody or myself. This desire is so strong that I am constantly afraid. And I do not know how to get free from fear.\\" Billy Corgan had a very unloving and hard family life, so it's no wonder this part would stand out for him. Billy knows the ultimate solution to all problems, and \\"God\\" asks him \\"Tell me tell me what you're after,\\" And Billy replies, \\"I just want to get there faster.\\" As in he wants to merge into the divine as fast as possible.     The song Suffer also clues us into Nisargadatta. Billy asks God twice, \\"will you wait?\\" And God quickly and compassionately replies twice: \\"Yes I will, I will wait for you.\\" But there are conditions. One must cleans his life before liberation, so God tells Billy, \\"To cleanse your life takes more than time,\\" because there will be obstacles --there will be challenges. But then God entices Billy into taking divinity here and now without going through all the trouble of struggles, challenges and more suffering and says, \\"Take what you want. Take all of it.\\" In other words, take divinity and all of creation. Say yes to the present moment. Everything is yours because there is no you and me, everything is One and only God is. Were these lyrics inspired by Nisargadatta? He writes:      Q:   Can you give us the taste of the experience of self-realisation?  M:  Take the whole of it! It is here for the asking. But you do not ask. Even when you ask, you do   not take. Find out what prevents you from taking.  Q:   I know what prevents -- my ego.  M:  Then get busy with your ego -- leave me alone. As long as you are locked up within your mind,   my state is beyond your grasp.
B002WPVNZM|5.0|I am absolutely blown away by One Republic's second offering.  I honestly didn't think they'd be able to live up to the first album, Dreaming Out Loud, and braced myself for a less-than-stellar release.  I am pleased to say that I was dead wrong.  Not only have they lived up to it, they've surpassed it!  It's a completely magical experience and I feel lucky to have such beautiful music to brighten my world with.  If you love One Republic you are in for a really sweet treat... you won't be disappointed!

B001AVCFK6|5.0|JJ Abrams is becoming his generation's Steven Spielberg and this Star Trek movie is as great as anything he has done so far. This big budget treatment did an outstanding job of casting young actors that accurately represent the stars of the original Star Trek of the 1960s. Its a tough, gritty movie that has a couple of laughs and the picture and sound are state of the art. I do think it is too violent for younger children, I won't let my 6 year old, who has seen Star Wars, see it. I didn't let her see [[ASIN:B002MIK0V2 Transformers/Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen [Blu-ray]]] either due to the amount of sci-fi violence but she has seen the first one. Anyway, excellent movie that has a time paradigm shift that basically set everything seen previously on all the Star Trek series/movies as happening in an alternate reality. This sets the stage for more Star Trek movies and possibly even new TV series. This is a great movie and hopefully Abrams will make several more. Bring on Q and The Borg! Gene Roddenberry would be proud.
0307454541|1.0|I don't know what all the fuss is about.  I thought this book was boring and dull.  It took me a long time to finish, but I did finally finish it.  The plot is plodding and unexciting, and the main character is a putz.  I really didn't feel that much affinity for him.  The girl with the tattoo is more interesting however the book is not about her, she is only a supporting character, and she is very weird and cold, so it is hard to feel very sympathetic toward her.  The plot is tedious, on and on, beating around the bush and dragging it out, and when you get there, it is anti-climactic and disappointing.  And, on and on some more (it's long), about coffee and sandwiches and binders and walks and more coffee...  I really ended up not caring about the details of the story at all.  I was disappointed.  I'd say skip it and move on to the next one..

B0019X3ZZY|2.0|I've never had more wildly mixed feelings about any film than Pasolini's \\"Salo.\\" The reviewers who note that it is a serious work of art, and not an exploitation film, are absolutely correct. Yet \\"Salo\\" goes beyond disturbing, and in many ways I feel it is dangerously unsound.<br /><br />While I've never read De Sade's \\"120 Days of Sodom,\\" Pasolini seems to remain true to the Sadean \\"ideal\\" (if you can call it that). He also does a brilliant job of making the Sadean story of sexual torture and dehumanization a bold allegory of Fascist Italy, and indeed of any totalitarian state. Why must these young people be sexually humiliated and murdered? Because four old men say they must. It should also be stated that the violence in \\"Salo\\" seems almost tame after 35 years of ever-increasing cinematic mayhem. (The scenes of coprophagia, however, remain pristinely nauseating.)<br /><br />So why do I turn thumbs down on \\"Salo?\\" Because I cannot shake the feeling that Pasolini--not politically, but literally--sided more with the torturers than the tortured in this film. The very coldness of the sexual images seems to argue that Pssolini was a Sadist in the classic sense--someone who, like his Fascist dignitaries and their courtesan accomplices, got an enormous kick out of the pain and humiliation of others.<br /><br />\\"Salo\\" remains a fascinating intellectual exercise, but one you will want to expel from your mind as quickly as possible. Here's the kicker: you won't be able to, and trying only makes it more vivid in the memory.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|First, a review in regards to the Blu-Ray quality. As expected, the picture and audio quality is astounding. More so made by the fact that it was terribly projected when I first saw this film in the cinema. Can't see it was an optimal presentation, nevertheless, the picture projection in cinemas have been disappointments of late. This BD puts every non-digital projection cinema to shame. If this edition has 3D capabilities, this would be the final nail in the coffins of cinema projection. The audio quality is superb. Dialouge is clear and even my most favourite moments where the soundtrack hums softly (especially in the bittersweet opening), it is subtle and poignant.    Without reiterating the plot, this movie is one of the best films of this year. Beats Transformers 2 right out of the block. I couldn't even imagine how on earth TF2's gross could beat this similarly box office friendly film. I guess good clean and well-intentioned fun is out of the question for today's kids. You don't get to see a senior citizen as a protagonist in any movies that often nowadays. The last time someone has done something revolutionary like that was David Lynch, who made 'A Straight Story'. A poignant bittersweet film about redemption and gaining back one's soul and heart from a senior citizen's perspective.
0316017922|4.0|That was pretty much the only revelation I had by reading this book. The high rating goes to the amount and kind of research that went into explaining why successful people are the way they are. Mr. Gladwell has a knack for making dull statistical data interesting and entertaining. It's fascinating to learn about how one's date of birth can seriously affect his hockey career, or academic excellence for that matter. It was also great to reaffirm what we already know about the role of culture and community in the success (and failure) of the individual.<br /><br />The book was mostly reiterating what most educated people know about success. Even the revelation I had about the 10,000 hour rule is nothing more than the old adage \\"Practice makes Perfect.\\" The stories the author uses to support his findings are in and of themselves a compelling read. I certainly enjoyed reading them and re-learning why common sense and perseverance are the only true measures that will bring you success in the end.<br /><br />This is a great book of entertaining statistics and not a how-to to success.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Why review a product almost seven years old with well over 300 reviews written already? Simply because in my humble opinion, this dvd is timeless. Granted, you have to like this type of music, but that said, it is truly awe inspiring. I like the Beatles, but I'm not a fanatic of them or of anyone else. This show, although loaded with commercial (read... profit) potential, was NOT done for primarily commercial reasons, and that becomes obvious immediately. All the artists involved are there purely out of love and respect for a man that contributed hugely to their lives, and to so many others in so many ways. You can't help but feel it, even though you are not actually there in time or space... it literally transcends time and space, and that is truly a testament to a great work of art. All of the musicians play right from their hearts and souls, and it's pure magic. A huge 'thank you' to all of the artists (including and especially George Harrison) that came together to give the world such a gift.
B002SEW5WW|4.0|Ok...this is a revised review that I'd written about 6 months ago...I'd written off Onerepublic when listened to the cd version, because maybe I was in a bad mood or just didn't give it a fair shake for this Waking Up cd. That said, I've recently downloaded the MP3 version thru Amazon and with the addtl tracks included and the great acoustic cover of Duffy's Mercy....this is a solid album. Is it as good or better than \\"Dreaming Out Loud\\"...NO. But I like how they've incorporated the solid beats from previous work but added some new direction (like channeling their inner U2 on some tracks)     Standout tracks:  All the Right Moves  Secrets  Good Life  Fear  Waking Up  Lullaby (which pulls at the heartstrings everytime you listen to it)  Passenger  Trap Door  Sucker Punch  Mercy    This is a solid return for Onerepublic and I'm now a fan all over again. Thx Amazon for doing the MP3 version w/ added tracks. Good job! Enjoy
0783226888|5.0|I always think back to when he came on the scene on Moonlighting. Liked his character of course, but it never occurred to me that he would become a great actor like he has. Since then he's established himself as the sure thing in movie quality. He had to go a bit with this character, bad guys make him work harder I think. As mentioned by others some of the special effects were cheesy but consider the time it was made, 1997. It's an edge of your seat thriller from start to finish and has a very satisfying ending. Great cast, even Richard Gere turns in a good performance, and it's good to see Sidney Poitier again. He does a great job. I highly recommend this movie for action thriller fans.
0143038583|2.0|Umm you can watch a movie that is on the web that covers all the info that's in this book. I understand that we need to eat more sustainable products, and that we should stay clear of GMO food products. this book was a waist of money, and the info enclosed in its covers is readily available on the web. Any foodie should already know the information that is in this book.<br />I'm a chef, and I guess this is a good read for a high school kid that's interested in the negative effects of humanity on the environment pertaining to food sources. I thought this book was more of a historical reference to the concepts behind the multiple course meal, I was wrong, hence forth the reason that I'm giving it 2 stars.

In my honest opinion ( and some fans of the band will think that I am an idiot ) I now rank this new album equal to \\"Mutter\\" and \\"Reise, Reise\\". I think it's awesome that Rammstein have become a little more experimental and creative with their music. I'm glad that they still don't have that \\"Herzeleid\\" and \\"Sehnsucht\\" sound of the past. You can definately tell that they have grown and matured in many ways. Sorry to the few fans out there that are dissapointed with Rammstein's epic new material, you all are missing out. Oh well, more for us THE PROUD AND TRUE RAMMSTEIN FANS! \\"Geneessen Sie\\"!
0061767581|5.0|I actually really enjoyed this book. It was light, fun, and a perfect read. I will def be getting the next 1. Congrats Lauren for graduating from the Hills. You certainly left at a good time BUT The hills is nothing without you.
B000001FQQ|4.0|This is a pretty good CD overall. While it may lack some of the dynamics of KISS's earlier 80's works such as Creatures Of The Night, Lick It Up, and Animalize, it was still a solid entry in the KISS library of music, and it featured some really good songs, including the great ballad by Paul Stanley, Forever.<br /><br />The album also featured a song sung by drummer Eric Carr, titled Little Caesar. It would also, sadly, be the last album that Carr would drum on, as he died a couple of years after the making of the album.<br /><br />Hot In The Shade could be looked at as a mile marker signalling the end of the Hair Metal sounds of the past decade. Soon, Grunge music would make the scene and rule the airwaves, and gone would be the fun, wild, crazy, and carefree sounds of the Eighties.<br /><br />Standout tracks are Rise To It, Hide Your Heart, Read My Body, Love's a Slap In The Face, Forever, Cadillac Dreams, The Street Giveth And The Street Taketh Away, and Little Caesar.
B002MU4NL8|5.0|When I first saw this, it was time when Trekkies and such were out. Star Trek was hot as a flashback/pop culture thing, and this movie looked to be a cheap cash-in.    But that couldn't be farther from the truth. I was shocked at how good it was. The story is spot-on, making fun of all the aspects that deserve it (fans, plot devices, typecasting, James Tiberius Kirk and more) and the cast was a fantastic get for a movie that plays as just a spoof. When you can get Sam Rockwell (in his 2nd best Sci-Fi role) to play a bit part, you're doing very well. And Tim Allen, who so often turns out poorly instead shows us all that with a good script, he can hold his own against actors like Alan Rickman and Tony Shalhoub who would seem to far outclass him.    This movie is entertaining all the way, with only a very few short dead spots. All the characters are played well and it actually works as its own story, beyond being a Star Trek riff.    I could hardly imagine how this could be made better. Even making it actually mention Star Trek directly would only limit their ability to make light of the characters and actors.    I could not possibly recommend this more to fans of Star Trek, Sci-Fi or just good comedy. This movie is one of a select few that I watch over and over when I need entertainment (alongside Caddyshack, Trading Places and Office Space), it's just that good.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I've been a Beatles fan all of my life.From the first time I ever seen them on Ed Sullivan playing Lady Madonna.They hit this America like a whirlwind no one has ever seen.They swept all the girls off there feet,and well the guys just liKed the music flat out.This remake of all there music ,mono and stero is awsome.I dare to think what they would have been like with todays technology.But the mono cd's that I purchased really brings out the best of them all and there instruments.I would highly recomend this set to anyone who might be thinking about buying them.
B001PO53IO|4.0|I was very excited when I first read these were coming out as a box set on Blu Ray, but the original price many retail outlets were advertising made me cringe.  Thankfully, Amazon came along at nearly half the price!  Since I pre-ordered, these were at my door the day it came out.  I'm with many out there that are annoyed by having a HD TV and outside of football, rarely get to enjoy the quality it was made to bring in my viewing experience. Cartoon Network does not have HD for these where I am, so this set was a treat.  I missed many of the earlier episodes as well, so I also got to do some catch up.    Episodes like \\"Ambush\\", \\"Hostage Crisis\\" and the whole \\"Ryloth\\" trilogy make these alone a must own for any true fan of the series, or Star Wars.  Yes, like any show, there are weak episodes (all the Jar Jar episodes (three of them) are even more annoying because they know the disdain so many fans have for this character, yet for some reason \\"King George\\" thinks it cute to shove him down people's throats).  But overall, there are so many quality episodes and plotlines that you can't even get irriated by the handful of weak episodes on these discs.  The extras are top notch, as are the animation and blu ray experience.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|The title says it all as it is the very best, love every track, her unique smooth voice is so easy to listen to and touches the senses and takes me on a journey of pure delight.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Tim Burton fostered in a new era of superhero films with his impressively dark, original Batman films BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS. Then Joel Schumacher trashed all that with his horrific, comical and empty flicks BATMAN FOREVER and BATMAN AND ROBIN.<br /><br />Thankfully, Christopher Nolan's 2005 rendering BATMAN BEGINS is a fine return to form for the popular dark superhero. Nolan based BB in \\"reality\\" and focuses on young Bruce Wayne (excellent work by Christian Bale), who witnessed the murder of his parents as a child, who travels the world trying to understand the criminal mind and ends up undertaking ninja training in the Far East under the tutelage of Henri Ducard (a slyly malevolent Liam Neeson) and Ras Al Ghul.<br /><br />Upon his return to Gotham after years of exile, Wayne resumes his place as the head of Wayne Manor, which was taken care of in his absence by family major domo Alfred (fine performance by the esteemed Michael Caine) and Wayne Industries, run by Mr. Earle (wonderfully played by veteran screen bad guy Rutger Hauer). Wayne also meets Lucius Fox (reliably played by the great Morgan Freeman), the head of the Development section of Wayne Industries, and enlists his help in obtaining high-tech equipment so that he can begin leading his double life as both Wayne and Batman. Last, but not least, Bruce re-acquaints himself with his childhood friend and now assistant DA Rachel Dawes (played surprisingly well by Katie Holmes).<br /><br />So the adventure begins! Batman prowls the streets of Gotham at night taking out scuzzy lowlifes at first (he saves Rachel from some goons on the subway) and making his initial mark. He also thwarts the city's top criminal Carmine Falcone (solidly played by Tom Wilkinson), who ironically is the man who ordered the kill of the man who killed Bruce's parents. Batman also meets Police Sgt. Jim Gordon (superb work by Gary Oldman), who initially skeptical, ends up being the conduit between Batman and the police force. Batmanruns into a higher class of criminal in Dr. Crane/Scarecrow (creepily played by Cillian Murphy), who shoots a toxic concoction from his mask to literally psych out his victims. At the climax, Batman must save Gotham from his former mentor Ducard, who it turns out was the head ninja Al Ghul all along!<br /><br />BATMAN BEGINS is perhaps the first Batman film to focus primarily on the hero himself and not the villains. A highly involving character study of one man's despair, disillusionment, acceptance, strength, and resolve, Nolan manages to elevate BB above the genre. I've not seen all his work, but I've got to believe this is perhaps one of the best (if not the best!) performance of Christian Bale's career. Additionally, Nolan does a good job of CGI-ing effects to make a real city an authentic stand-in for Gotham. A superhero film where the protagonist is the star? Novel idea!
B001G0MFOM|4.0|As an avid watcher of The L Word, I anxiously awaited the release date for the final season. I'd read some unkind reviews of the final season but figured that the series couldn't end in a way that would disappoint me. I was WRONG. With the exception of one or two things, I had no real problems until the last episode. (((SPOILER ALERT))) I did not like that they broke up Helena and Dylan. The chemistry between those two was absolutely electric and I think that they were the 2nd best couple on the show (the first being Tina and Bette). As far as the last episode, they left way too much to the imagination. I am one of those people who needs to know how things end. I don't like when major events are left open for interpretation.     I still reccommend The L Word Final Season for anyone who is as into the show as I am. It absolutely could've ended better, but it was still a wonderful series.
0882709194|1.0|The text was going to be a full version of Darwin's book, but for \\"costs\\" 4 sections got cut out and some parts shortened. Most sections included deal with possible faults in evolutionary theory. The 50 page introduction is one of the most hilarious yet angering things I've ever seen, and solidifies my bewilderment of how Ray Comfort draws any size audience. Filled with blatantly biased connotations, logical fallacies, and some of the worst false analogies I've ever seen, Comfort repeatedly bludgeons the reader with oversimplified arguments. Comfort includes arguments that he undoubtedly knows are pointless and have been successfully refuted with logic, arguments  such as transitional forms, missing links, and the Cambrian Explosion. One of my favorites is the analogy that inevitable judgment by God is like jumping out of a plane from 10,000 feet where your options of salvation are the Mona Lisa, the keys to a Lamborghini, a million dollars, or a parachute. The parachute is Christianity, described as the right option because God serves as a parachute for us, while Hinduism is jumping out of the plane, \\"getting sucked back in as another passenger\\" in either the Economy or First class, but \\"doesn't deal with your real problem of having sinned against God and the reality of Hell.\\" Maybe Mr. Comfort wasn't informed that Hinduism doesn't believe in Gods or sins, making it irrelevant. Buddhism is likened to \\"standing at the door of the plane and saying, \\"I'm not really here, and there's no such thing as the law of gravity, and no ground that I'm going to hit.\\"\\" The section of Islam is about four times as long as the sections on Hinduism and Buddhism, and with an ironic tone, stating Islam is \\"an attempt to bribe the \\"Judge of the Universe\\", and used the Bible as an argument against Islam. He wraps the introduction up by asserting the fear of death and judgement to the reader,thanking themfor reading, urging them not to toss this book aside. It sounds like Ray Comfort didn't intend the actual body of the book to be read. With great tact, Ray signs off promoting a website and his other book.
1569242739|5.0|I am dairy/soy allergic, yet I crave the delicious desserts that are forbidden to me.  THIS cookboook had allowed me to have EASY, tasty, dairy-free desserts and treats that regular meat-eating, dairy swilling folk try and LOVE and then can't believe that they're VEGAN!!!    What I love about this cookbook is that they give pictures of every cupcake.  The book has wonderful, sometimes humorous, easy to follow directions, and most can be whipped up in about 20min, bake another 20, cool, frost and you're ready to go.    If you're vegan, you probably have all the ingredients in your kitchen already, and even if you're not, there isn't usually much to buy (except a lot more cupcake papers.)      Some recipes may need a little tweaking if like me you don't use the soy products and use rice/coconut milks instead.  For instance, if using rice milk for the Coconut Pecan Frosting , use less rice milk (a technique to use also with the Chocolate Mint Cupcake frosting,) use more cornstarch, or add more shredded coconut (or a combo of all three.)  Other than that, the recipies turn out perfect every time.  I haven't botched a single batch, and there is a growing request list for my cupcakes.    I would say this is the cupcake book to end all cupcake books, and if you're looking for easy cake desserts with wonderful bakery-type buttercream frosting, this is the cookbook for you.    Note:  I don't write reviews, but this is the only thing so far where I felt I HAD to write a one.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|This album is simply amazing!<br />If you liked \\"Dreaming Out Loud\\", you will love \\"Waking Up.\\" It is one of the few albums in which every song is exceptional. This record completely surpassed my expectations. It's beautifully written, filled with emotion, and gorgeously recorded.<br />Some of the stand-outs include: \\"Everybody Loves Me,\\" \\"Good Life,\\"  \\"Made for You\\" & [arguably their best song so far] \\"Secrets\\" (soon to be their second single.)<br />Definitely buy it. You won't be disappointed.

B002H3F7F6|3.0|Eagerly anticipated this album. Long time Sting fan. Disappointed is the word that comes to mind, over and over. Fine instrumental arrangements often obscured by poor mix with the vocals. Vocals distracting, especially when out of the vocalist's range.
0316069906|5.0|Foer is funny and endearing while writing about a topic that so often causes others to become dramatic, preachy and, unfortunately, inaccurate. No stone (or baby chick) is left unturned in this fantastic piece of journalism. A must-read for anyone who eats - or doesn't eat - meat.

B001PR0YDA|5.0|Walt Disney's Buena Vista Productions and Robert Zemekis's adds twists and turns and \\"magic\\" to this new depiction of the Charles Dickens classic tale.  Imagine riding one of the dioramas at the theme park and watching Zemekis's perennial Christmas favorite, The Polar Express, one can imagine what to expect from this very imaginative version.<br /><br />The digital technology and computerized animation spotlight this film.  But in order to experience the special effects, one must absolutely see the IMAX 3-D edition.  The 3-D glasses may be somewhat of an inconvenience, especially for those who wear prescription eyeglasses, but all worth it once viewers see the eye-popping scenes that provide the extravagance, fast-paced, and full-dimensional senses of the entire film, such as the winter snowfall that one can almost imagine touching as well as Ebenezer Scrooge glaring his notorious facial expressions; Jim Carrey does a fine job playing Scrooge as well as the almost unrecognizable Ghost of Christmas Present.  And in addition, there is certainly plenty of fun and frolicking within the film to add the Christmas spirit to one's holiday film viewing, and one scene in particular is where the Ghost of Christmas Past takes Scrooge back to revisit one of the most jubilant periods in his life where jolly old Mr. Fezziwig hosts the Christmas ball filled with music, laughter, and dancing.  And lastly, what would A Christmas Carol be like without the London city streets and their quaint Victorian d&eacute;cor that adds even more sprinkles of Christmas throughout the film?<br /><br />Indeed, one can go on and on about the numerous surprises throughout the film and the jaw-dropping scenes.  But after the last credit flickers on the screen, Christmas film aficionados will most likely want to see the film more than once.

0882709194|2.0|While the body of the actual paper done by Darwin is a fascinating read both in terms of science, philosophy, history, sociology and politics, the intro to the book attempts to create an atmosphere representing an unbiased perspective on the landmark paper.  But by including this perspective, bias is in fact introduced; a bias that clearly says why this work should be distrusted by those who chose to pick which bits of information they will use based upon whether or not it aligns with their religious perspective.  It does so without taking into consideration any of the aspects I mentioned in the first sentence, or providing any inkling that any of the questions posited by the self proclaimed ID (Creationist) author are currently being researched by scientists, or that they have already been adequately explained by scientifically supported research with supporting data.  I work at university in the bible belt where the community religious groups actively seek to discredit evolutionary theory at every turn.  Their latest effort is to hand out free copies of this book to students, most of whom lack a significant (or even a basic) understanding of how science works, and will therefore see the questions asked in the intro as legitimate and thought provoking enough to warrant questioning or dismissing, without substance or verification to the affirmation or contrary, the data in support the theory of Evolution. If the Creationists (IDers) really want people to draw their own unbiased conclusions about scientific validity of \\"On the Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection\\" by Darwin, then why not let them read it without the opinions of someone with a religious agenda masking his true goal by using thinly disguised \\"questions to ponder\\". I haven't yet compared the text in this volume to those of the original publication to make sure the former is intact. But assuming it is, the text by Darwin alone is worth the money, provided the reader understands what the introreally is -propaganda meant to confound rather than enlighten.  At least it gives scientists the opportunity to show just how little the intro author knows and understands, or how deceptively dishonest he is by answering the questions in the intro with factual information in our science classes.

B002QH2NUA|4.0|I bought this set, primarily for the DVD.    The DVD is a VAST improvement over McCartney's previous live videos.      Let's take a look:      Rockshow  (great movie, but not a complete show.)    Get Back  (incomplete show.  annoyingly cut from many different shows.   Too many audience shots, etc.)    Paul Is Live  (incomplete show.  Too many MTV style cuts.   Headache inducing.)    Back In The US  (every song is interrupted by documentary footage.  Way too much focus on audience shots, and not enough of what's going on stage.)    Live In Red Square / St. Petersburg  (horrible editing.  Like Paul Is Live, its headache inducing.)    The Space Within US  (incomplete show.  Documentary footage and celebrity testimonials interrupt every song.  Extra disappointing, as this was one of my favorite Paul tours, and a horrible document of what was an amazing tour.)      Oh, how I wished Paul would just release a concert DVD, with no documentary footage between songs.  Of a complete show.   And edit it well.    Good Evening, NYC fits the bill.    Almost.    It is the full show.   The editing is not as jumpy as some of the others.    No extraneous footage between songs, ruining the flow of the concert.    But I subtract a star for the inclusion of 'audience cam'.   At the shows, they distributed little handheld video cameras, to a number of concertgoers.   And some of this amateur footage, is sometimes mixed in with the professional footage.   I'd have rather had the pro footage only.     So its not exactly what I wanted.  But it's getting closer.

One of a few movies that I can watch time and time again.

0060853980|5.0|I first read this book when I was in high school (10 years ago) and I still love it today. I have recommended it to many people over the years. I think that this would be great for Young Adults who are just getting into fantasy and science fiction. I think that it would also be good for people who liked Coralline and The Graveyard Book. It is silly in a \\"Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\\" type of way, so I think you have to be a fan of British humor to love it!
B0002CHIJW|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, i am a huge movie buff horror and disturbed movies are among my favorites, I Spit On Your Grave was a really good revenge movie it is set in the 80s a women goes to a remote cabin for a get away she is raped and tortured over and over again by 4 men, she is left for dead,but does not die she vows revenge, and gets it ,in very horrorific ways, it is a great revenge movie i highly recomend this movie, along with last house on the left.

1405862416|5.0|This is a wonderful, although depressing, book. I bought it for my granddaughter for Christmas because it was on her list. However, I did not pay attention to the rating as far as scolastic rating and it is far too simple for her. That is my only problem with the book. I do not recall if that was clearly explained in the ordering process. But that has nothing to do with the story which is amazing. It was much more alarming when I first read it in 1962, however, than it is now.

0307277453|5.0|Your Inner Fish is an interesting book by Neil Shubin who is an anatomy professor at the University of Chicago. In this book, Shubin attempts to find links from early life forms all the way up to the present modern human.    He devotes a chapter to discuss the development of each of the various body parts over time. Briefly summarizing:    In Chapter one, we learn about his co-discovery of the famous fossil Tiktaalik. This fossil actually has specialized fins that have bones that correspond to the upper arm, forearm, and parts of a wrist. It is believed to be an intermediary between fish and tetrapod.    Chapter two discusses the common plan for limbs; chapter three shows how DNA of ancient genes may have been repurposed for development of limbs with fingers and toes for example. The remaining chapters discuss the development of teeth, the head, nose and smell, eyes and vision, ears and hearing.    In all of this, Shubin tries to demonstrate how what make us human today - all of our constituent parts - has its origins in the creatures that preceded us. It would make a welcome addition to your collection of books on the evolutionary process.

0882709194|1.0|I view this release as yet another victory for the theory of evolution. The author has failed at attacking the theory, so must resort to attacking Darwin himself. It's laughable.
1400031001|5.0|This novel is a tour de force, a masterpiece not only of literature but an honest and astute observation of a man's life over the 20th century.  It is beautifully written, and there are times when you will be wondering if this is not some sort of autobiography, sensitively edited by friends and colleagues, complete with footnotes and additional explanations.  It is very, very clever.<br /><br />But in the midst of all this clever writing there is a very honest and heartfelt story, of a man who marries becuase its expected of him, and then throws it all away for love; who lives through the horror of war and loses what is important to him.  It is a charming portrait of youth, and an honest portrait of old age.  It is utterly wonderful.<br /><br />It isn't always an easy read, but it is a unique snapshot of a life, beautifully spun out and presented, and I highly recommend it.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|This movie is a timeless classic.  For those struggling to describe what it is about...I'll say it in one word...family.  It is about the unspoken ties that bind family members together across years and miles.    This movie will tug at your heart, make you shed a few tears, and realize that at the end of the day, all we really have is eachother.  If you have family member you need to reconcile with, this movie will do it for you.  It is a confirmation of what really matters in all our lives.    Rent it, buy it, but most of all...see it.  The soundtrack is excellent as well.
B001BGTWXI|5.0|For a band that is still relatively young, there sure is a lot of history behind the name Slipknot. This Des Moines, Iowa-based eight-piece released a first full-length in 1999, and this very angsty and aggressive eponymous debut was soon successful (it would go on two become certified Double Platinum in the U.S. and spawn two hit singles), so they quickly followed it up with an even more brutal affair in 2001. But the plan backfired because \\"Iowa\\" was not more successful than the debut -- in fact, it was substantially less. (It only sold about half as many units, and met with a fairly mixed critical response.) On top of this, at the time, frontman Corey Taylor was actively trying to fight off alcoholism, and several of his peers were battling drug addiction. So, Slipknot decided to take an important hiatus. Then, after spending a disappointingly long time to time to rest, soul-search, dabble with side-project (i.e. Stone Sour, The Murderdolls, To My Surprise), and revamp/think of new ideas, they finally mounted a comeback with \\"Vol. 3 (The Subliminal Verses)\\" three years later. Unfortunately, many \\"maggots\\" (a.k.a. devout followers) felt disgusted and even betrayed by the 2004 offering since it was not nearly as brutal as anything they had heard before. Some also think of it as being a somewhat phoned-in effort, with its almost blatant attempt at pop appeal with the inclusion of acoustic guitars, slower tempos, more tuneful vocals (including good cop/bad cop parts), less profanity, and even the occasional ballad (!). But on the other hand, many listeners loved the new record, and couldn't get enough of it. In addition, the album opened many new doors by converting an unquantifiable number of non-fans, and shifting over a million copies in just one year's time. Indeed, if nothing else, everyone can at least agree that \\"Vol. 3\\" acted as was the divider in a complete polarization of the group's fan base.<br /><br />And now, Slipknot again find themselves at a crossroads. The boys have heard all of the positive and negative feedback from last time, and they have once again taken a break away from music, management, and each other. And when considering this hiatus was even longer, it shouldn't be surprising to hear rumors galore about the band splitting-up any day now. One can't help but wonder that if that really is the case, what will this final release sound like? Which side of the fence will it be on -- go back the sheer heaviness of the early days, or continue down the newer material's more commercially accessible path? Well, a good band would find it too easy to go the heavy-way and dig up only moderately challenging material from several years ago; and a good band would find it too predictable to just cash-in on the success of a recent release. So, Slipknot do not do either one. True, at first glance, \\"All Hope Is Gone\\" appears to continue down the path of the latter of the two, since it begins with some pretty heavy stuff and eventually segues into more docile territory. However, do not be mislead -- there is a whole lot more to this record than what one might initially think. See, the more it plays, the more it becomes apparent that more than a few delicious curveballs are wisely thrown into the mix. (All of which are well-placed, too, and none of which will anybody ever see coming.) The result is a very unique and memorable contrast. Plus, even the old-school-esque tunes do not sound dated because an inescapable sense of urgency and new life has been breathed into them. (Much of this hour-long playing-time is living proof that Corey and the gang are still as mosh-pit-friendly as ever.) Thus, \\"AHOG\\" never sounds even remotely monotonous, half-baked, or like a plain rehash of past glories. It is simultaneously comfortable and unpredictable, brutal and beautiful, complex and catchy, epic and always over-too-soon.<br /><br />\\".execute.\\" kicks things off with a bunch of loud, static-y, cluttered-sounding white noise, and no,there isn't much more to this track (which becomes almost cacophonous by its end) than that, but it is the perfect lead-in to song number two. \\"Gematria (The Killing Name)\\" is a brutal, blistering, and wholly engaging riff-fest filled with frothing intensity, excellent, inventive, razor-sharp thrash riffage, dizzying, jackhammer percussion, tight, punishing rhythms, great, deep grooves, huge breakdowns, and a good guitar solo duel. Suffice it to say, it is a dark, dense, and Slayer-worthy death-tinged thrasher, and one heckuva opening punch. \\"Sulfur\\" begins on a surprisingly slow, and dare-I-say-doomy note, with foreboding feedback and drum patterns, and some of turntablist Sid Wilson's fluid scratching. Things suddenly get kicked up a notch whenever booming power chords and Joey Jordison's slamming thrash beats enter the fray, but with verses that consist of somewhat restrained tempos and gnawing guitars, and choruses that are soaring and soulfully-sung, \\"Sulfur\\" manages to be equally fast, slow, heavy, and melodic.<br /><br />With definite industrial metal leanings, electronic undertones, and a rhythmic, stomping rhythm reminiscent of vintage Rammstein, \\"Psychosocial\\" is clearly the first curveball to be found here. Really emotional vocals, lyrics that won't soon be forgotten, smart, stop-start time signatures, diverse drum fills, and crunching bass lines abound here, too. The chorus is also killer, and comes in two parts: Open, sing-songy sections, and a nasty, visceral, hardcore-style shout-along. \\"Dead Memories\\" is obviously the album's lead single, thanks to its use of galloping, dance-floor-ready beats, and ginormous, catchy choruses that are filled with soaring melodies, and heavenly harmonies. A few good, blazing guitar solos crop up here, as well. Back on the bludgeoning side, \\"Vendetta\\" is highlighted by with an excellent, Kataklysm-style drum solo, and a deluge of mind-boggling drumming (including tons of thunderous and hyperfast blast beats), brutal riffs, blood-pumping tempos, and rabid vocals. The song is extreme enough to bring Morbid Angel to mind, but there are just enough solid melodies and groove-oriented breakdowns present to break up its samey-soundingness and make sure things never get too out-of-control. Following that, \\"Butcher's Hook\\" features another deft and bouncy (if brief) drum intro, and visceral bellows not unlike Hatebreed's Jamey Jasta.<br /><br />\\"Gehenma\\" is a highly intelligent and experimental piece with numerous unexpected peaks, valleys, twists, breaks, and tempo-changes. Sometimes it opts for a doomy sound with heavy, sludgy guitars, and sometimes it opts to lean more towards the industrial metal line. It does not need any specific song-structure and is not a snug fit for any one genre, but at least the listener can always count on it retaining plenty of hummable groove and melodic hooks. Meanwhile, Taylor splits his time between ominous, spoken-word vocals, accomplished, upper-register singing, and nasty, blood-curdling growls, and some nice guitar melodies also help to make the arrangements even more dynamic (and they do so without sounding watered down). Although not quite as epic in scope, \\"This Cold Black\\" is similarly commendable for its breadth and terrifically slow-burning tone. Following a creepy intro composed of minimalistic noise, doomy atmospheres, and humming bass notes, it slowly but surely gains momentum over the next four-plus minutes, and ultimately snowballs into a pulsating attack of fiery, machine-gun riffing, pounding drums, and being capped off with couple of ripping solos.<br /><br />The strong, cast-iron guitar licks, impeccable trapkit battery, and lumbering, Meshuggah-inspired rhythms behind \\"Wherein Lies Continue\\" more or less pick up where its predecessor left off. It is also noteworthy for offsetting dissonant music with wailing clean backing vocals, and to excellent effect. \\"Snuff\\" comes next, and many people may be quick to write this song off, but theywould be foolish to do so. Yes, it is a predictable, token ballad, and the kind that is frequently heard on modern rock radio. That doesn't mean it isn't a big standout track, though, quite possibly the highpoint of the album, and one of the best things in Slipknot's whole discography. This \\" gorgeous, ambient, sweet (though not sappy), and insanely infectious acoustic strummer is saturated with strong hooks, siren-like harmonies, very impressive singing, and poetic lyrics. Finally, back on familiar ground once gain, the title song is very ripping cut of almost pure thrash, and is backed by buzzsaw picking, a blazing solo, catchy DJ scratches, and precise drumming.<br /><br />True, some \\"maggots\\" probably won't be content with another new release unless it's, well, a re-issue of anything from the \\"Mate Feed Kill Repeat\\" (a 1996 EP) -- \\"Iowa\\" era. But let's be honest here: This is improvement. Absolutely nobody can call this band just bunch of guys dressed up in masks and red jumpsuits anymore. They have mastered the art of texture, mature songwriting, expansive vocals, and technical musicianship. In fact, they are truly firing-on-all-cylinders, and without question, have never sounded as strong as they do now. Plus, this album just might grow on you and/or reveal something new with additional listens. (All of which are reasons to hold out, uh, \\"hope\\" for the future, even amidst the aforementioned supposed break-up rumors.) Intense, original, intricate, rewarding, well-rounded, enthralling (seriously, it's like the audio equivalent of roller coaster!), and positively brilliant, \\"All Hope Is Gone\\" is Slipknot's masterpiece., and rabid vocals.

B0006IUDXA|5.0|After all these years we decided to build up a collection of shows we had watched before, a long time ago. So this is pure nostalgia!! The whole season comes in a great package, yours to keep and watch whenever you like.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|It was priced perfect and received it quickly and it was exactly what I thought it was so no surprises.
068484267X|1.0|This book is unbelievably bad. The story is repetitive and the writing is horrendous. I suffered through the first 50 pages and finally said \\"enough!\\"
B000ZECQ08|1.0|Well put DL King!          After sneeking a view of snippets of this movie online and how \\"reserved?\\" \\"lackluster?\\" the emotional content displayed in two of the crescendo parts e.g. Snape's \\"mercy\\" killing of Dumbledore and the ultrication between Snape and Harry makes me hesitate to order this DVD. I think now I will wait and purchase it second hand and help someone else defray the \\"disappointment factor\\" cost of this travesy of a movie. The only thing movie producers pay attention to is money. There is a way to get your point across. Borrow it from the library.     Addendum to this review after borrowing the library copy;   OK, giggle..... I watched a library copy of this movie with my husband who was more entertained watching me watch the movie rather than the movie. He is well read and has belonged to literary clubs thoughout his parochial and college level schooling. That being said, the story line was so scattered he could not follow it and began asking logical questions. I spent nearly the entire movie as a \\"voice over\\" helping him pick up the pieces to where the plot was going (well, supposed to go) and he needed assistance to pay attention to small clues that should have been prominent. (Like Dumbledore's injured hand) that appeared to anyone who had not read the book or listened to the library audio book enroute to work as I did, rather normal looking.   I was at a total loss as to why wasted movie footage showing the Burrows being burned. As if we needed to be shown that Death eaters were really \\"bad\\" guys. And what is with the scene of Hermione's date thowing up a mouthful of Dragon balls in front of Snape? Did Snape smell alcohol on his breath to warrant a month's detention? I must have missed something here. The emotional climax of the entire book when Harry finds out the true identity of the \\"Half Blood Prince\\"  was such a let-down. In the book, Harry was supposed to be horror stricken and in his \\"out of mind\\" emotional agony of loss and betrayal, beg Snape for death as a release from it. When that does not work, Harry attempts to taunt Snape into such an frenzied anger he kills him. In this movie, Snape announces he is the Half Blood Prince almost as if he is grudgingly administering another school detention and walks off screen..........\\"What was that?\\"  No funeral or noticable tears for Dumbledore. The wands raised aloft prompted my husband to jokingly ask me where the Bic lighters were to flick on for better light at this lame concert.   The movie was far worse than I originally suspected.  I do not know who is most at fault, the screen writer Steve Kloves or director David Yates. I do not hold up hope or interest for the last two installments. This movie series has become progressively worse with each addition. Chris Columbus directing the first two years and Alfonso Curaon with the third movie are far superior in content and story line.  Like I mentioned in the beginning. Do not waste your money on this purchase. Your most enjoyable time will be to buy the audio book and listen to Jim Dale's voice. The movie created in your head while you do something useful like drive or do dishes will be much better. The vocal renditions of nearly all charaters by Jim Dale are far better than this movie. Wonderful voices.. Creature's voice always gets me laughing out loud.......and \\"Oh Gawd,\\" if Jim Dale could only mimic the deeply sensual, velvety vocal tones of Alan Rickman's Snape then there would be no need to suffer through the bad movie.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I WOULD ONLY PURCHASE VIDEO'S FROM AMAZON AS I AM HAVING A PROBLEM WITH THE OTHERS.  BEING COMPUTER ILLERATE I ORDERED FROM ANOTHER ONE LISTED THREE MONTHS AGO AND STILL NOTHING.  AMAZON IS FAST AND RELIABLE.....I WILL SHOP NO WHERE ELSE.

B001GCUNWQ|5.0|My son is almost 4 years old and absolutely loves the Ice Age movies.  We own all three now, and this is by far his favorite of them all.  He could watch this movie 3 or 4 times a day!  I recommend it to anybody looking for a good laugh!
B000NZD9RS|5.0|If you haven't heard this album, a part of your life has not been fulfilled. although it's not quite as good as The Dark Side of the Moon.
B000002NJM|4.0|The music is fantastic. There are a few skits that contain swearing. That was kind of a bummer.
B002NWRMVS|3.0|I was eagerly looking forward to Norah's new release, because I have her previous recordings and love them, particuliarly her first (Come Away with Me). Norah's voice is as good as usual, but I'm having a big problem getting past the distorted sound of the band. I personally found \\"Chasing Pirates\\" just irritating. \\"Man of the Hour\\" was cute/catchy. \\"Tell Yer Mama\\" was a keeper for me. The distortion and sound of \\"It's Gonna Be\\" turned me completely off. \\"Back to Manhattan\\" was a favorite for me. The rest I'm still trying to decide on.     I think Norah's \\"new sound\\" is not that much a departure from her old, except for the annoying distortion--the instruments almost sound too loud for her voice, for lack of a better description. The quality of the songs (lyrics-wise) is just not up there for me either. Overall, it's okay. Compared to her previous works it's a disappointment. But can Norah really put out a stinker? I don't think so.
B000PY52EU|5.0|OK, this film is not for prudes--it's pretty sleazy. It's about a young nymphomaniac who ends up in the care of a single black man who has just lost his wife to his brother and is ticked off about it. What happens between them is pretty unusual and is what makes this film unique.    I love Hill Country Blues, the music championed by such luminaries as the late great R.L. Burnside and the North Mississippi Allstars. the NMA contribute to the soundtrack, and most, if not all of the songs sung by Samuel T. Jackson (who does a great job) are R.L. Burnside songs. Just the fact that a filmmaker is honoring the music of the under-heralded R.L. Burnside is enough to deserve a five-star rating. Burnside's sidemen (including his grandson Cedric) appear in the film to accompany Jackson's performances, adding authenticity to the music.    And what the hey, the movie ends overall on a pretty good note, so some of the \\"dirtiness\\" you might feel watching this film should disappear by the end!    Living and singing the blues was never all peaches and cream, hence the dark tones in this flick--just makes it all bluesier! RECOMMENDED FILM for all blues fans! Oh, and for all Christina Ricci fans--she's pretty hot in this film! :-)
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|The Killers, a group of four likeable and extremely talented guys from Las Vegas who create exceptional music ( I mean in the footsteps of the Beatles exceptional), and who are well liked, respected, revered, and have number 1 hits and fill stadiums all over the UK, EU and Australia, have made a statement in this wonderful DVD presentation of their recent concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London 2009: Yo America - we are from your country and we really rock and put on a fabulous show - look at how we filled and energized the same location that the Beatles, the Stones and so many others filled and yet you have no clue what you have in us! You do not appreciate our crafted musicianship and our concert experience. We make folks happy and dance all over the world and they know the lyrics of most of our songs and sing along in a cacophony of musical bliss!     Buy this DVD and feel the emotion, the joy, the vibrant textures of melody, harmony, electricity and energy and see the Killers, the 4 lads from the USA turn this revered hall of music in Britain upside down with joy, presence and spectacular showmanship in the likes of Brandon Flowers, the lead singer, Dave Keuning, the fantastic lead guitarist, Mark Stoermer, bassist extraordinaire and Ronnie Vannucci Jr., the most energetic and exacting drummer since Bill Bruford.    America you can finally take notice of this great band made of our own native sons who make music like it was meant to be and touching all our souls! 5 Stars
B000JQU4TW|5.0|I have never read this book before getting it for my Kindle. I love it, the book makes you  tink about how you conduct your life and how it shows on you.<br />This book also gives the reader a window into the life of a the rich of England at the time. I find the book to be well writen, a great add (or like me a great beginning) to your classic collection.
B0009P42S2|4.0|Katsuhiro Otomo decided to go from cyberpunk with Akira to steampunk in this adventurous epic. The movie had the mild cost of over 25 million dollars, and was in production for well over a decade. Even though it didn't really make the kind of impact that Otomo's previous works did, it is still a compelling film.<br /><br />Set in the 1860s, Ray Steam(yes, his last name is Steam!)is the prodigal son of the steamologist, Edward. Edward and his genius father Lloyd have spent the last few years developing a highly compressed form of energy in a containment called a Steamball. Lloyd sends it to Ray for safe keeping from the conniving O'Hara Foundation, of which Edward has alligned himself with. Ray eventually gets kidnapped by the O'Hara thugs, and confront his father, along with the very bratty Scarlett O'Hara. He makes of with the Steamball, and tries to seek help from Edward's rival, Robert Stephenson(based on the actual scientist). However, Stephenson wants to use it to fight Edward and the O'Hara Foundation who have created a giant steam-powered flying fortress called the Steam Castle. The castle begins to assualt London during the Great Exhibition, which leads to some great battle sequences between the O'Hara and Stephenson forces, with steam-powered tanks, battlesuits, airplanes, and submarines. Ray uses the Steamball to create a portable rocket, and flies into the castle to stop his father, and rescue Lloyd and Scarlett. Ray gets Scarlett away before the castle eventually falls, although both Lloyd and Edward apparently surivived according to the montage during the closing credits.<br /><br />Steamboy is one of the shining examples of steampunk's influence on anime, more so than some Miyazaki movies like Howl's Moving Castle. It incorporates some of the best from the genre including the outlandish 19th Century technology and the bounding spirit found in the works of Mark Twain and Jules Verne. Now, the major faults with that though are it spends too much time debating on the morals of science and what it should be used for. The time they waste showing Lloyd and Edward arguing over philosophy alone would've taken at least thirty minutes off the movie. The other problem is that it's a little longer than necessary, and seems like it seriously lost alot of its direction during the last act. It does however leave a bold mark in the annuals of animation, and worth checking out at least for some exhilirating visuals. Very recommended for fans of children's literature.als of science and what it should be used for.

6304711891|5.0|My husband loves this movie and is buidling up quite a classic collection. It doesn't matter how many times that he has seen this, he will watch it again because it's so enjoyable.
B002JM1VJG|5.0|If you don't have any other Madonna's DVD, this is a MUST HAVE.  I missed American Life
B000P0J0EW|5.0|This is a keeper for you video collection. It will make you laugh and cry. A wonderful movie. Some sad moments, but they all work themselves out. Great to keep and great to give as a gift. Based on a short story by Stephen King.
B002K4MAA2|4.0|While we in the US load up on VH1 celebreality, the Brits make a great zombie mini series. Once again, corporate America complains about the internet, yet they don't make it available in the US. If you liked Dawn Of The Dead 2004/28 days etc, you should \\"seek\\" this one out. Very enjoyable story of an outbreak on the set of Big Brother.
6304806434|4.0|My husband added this to his video collection. It's an enjoyable movie, but more of a guy movie. A little too intense for me at times.

B00000JNO2|4.0|As far as this album is concerned, anything the original Skynyrd recorded is worthwhile!!  While the LP had a very flat sound/production quality, the remastered CD is clearer with a little more life to it and definately worth the upgrade if you're still listening to the vinyl.    I read an interview with Ronnie where he said he got the idea for the song Gimmme Back My Bullets in response to his desire to get Skynyrd back on the Billboard charts, where songs were marked by 'bullet' indicating song debut/or the number of spots a song had risen since last weeks chart.      Ronnie also mentioned that the band finally had to pull the song Gimme Back My Bullets from the setlist because fans continued to throw handfuls of live bullets on stage everytime they played the song when it first came out.
B00009NHC5|5.0|A classic film that I wanted to own.  Hepburn is one of my favorite actresses.
B002Q7JYPC|4.0|I bought this shortly after it came out. I was a big fan in the '70s and had most of their albums. I was a little unsure if this would be any good but I had hope as I had seen the \\"Hell Freezes Over\\" video and found it to be excellent.         With that said I do enjoy most tracks on this album. I find that Henley can be negative/depressed in his writing but he can still turn a phrase nonetheless. I also note that the \\"competition\\" between Henley and Frey continues. I'm surprised they continue to tour but maybe they have since worked thing out....
B000I0RNV6|5.0|This fabulous film I saw in a theater and wanted to own it.  I do  not mind the subtitles.
B002QEXN2K|3.0|November 17th, 2009 (release date)<br /><br />...However, some of these songs don't do it for me.<br /><br />But some of them do. Big time.<br /><br />I'll do a song by song review but it shouldn't be too long.<br /><br />HEARTBREAK WARFARE: Pleasant, has a &#34;spacey&#34; vibe in the production that is addicting. A great introduction to the CD. &#34;PLUS&#34;<br /><br />ALL WE EVER DO IS SAY GOODBYE: Another song that I would like if only the chorus wasn't repeated so damn much. The verses run good and the lyrics are insightful to John's life, but towards the end of the song, all you do is hear those flippin' lyrics &#34;All we ever do is say goodbye&#34;. Repeated. Over and over again. It grates. &#34;PLUS&#34;<br /><br />HALF OF MY HEART (Feat. TAYLOR SWIFT): After two full plays of this CD, the thing that grates about this song is that Taylor is only heard on two, *maybe* three lines of this song. And John is singing with her so it makes it less of a duet. I don't know what they were thinking! Has a country flair. &#34;OKAY&#34;<br /><br />WHO SAYS: Kind of comes and goes, but has personality. Not the best choice of a first single, but maybe in John or the exec's minds, it was. The guitar work sounds a lot like the one in STOP THIS TRAIN from his last album. Talks about shallow love and getting stoned. &#34;PLUS&#34;<br /><br />PERFECTLY LONELY: This one's not bad. But it's not great. The lyrics I can relate to. But the chorus is repeated too much. Better than HALF OF MY HEART. &#34;OKAY&#34;<br /><br />ASSASSIN: This one doesn't really strike me much. I like the &#34;you get in, you get done and then you get gone&#34; part. But nothing else really sticks out. It's here-and-gone syndrome. Through one ear, out the other. One I don't mind skipping. &#34;NEGATIVE&#34;<br /><br />CROSSROADS: I've never heard the original, but I'm guessing that it's better than this track. It doesn't inspire me to seek the original out. &#34;OKAY&#34;<br /><br />WAR OF MY LIFE: Non-threatening. Maybe if I pay more attention to the lyrics, it would be better. But it too, kinda comes and goes. It's very soft and can easily be forgotten. &#34;OKAY&#34;<br /><br />THANK GOD John saves the last three spaces for good, good tracks. No major complaints about the remainder of the CD.<br /><br />EDGE OF DESIRE: I like how the third chorus is almost shouted in the beginning. It gives this CD life. Maybe some didn't even get to this track because it does have a little passion in it. &#34;PLUS&#34;<br /><br />DO YOU KNOW ME: The guitar is ILL in this song. And I mean that in a great way. It's very, very catchy. Infectious even. Probably the shortest track on the album running at a measly 2:30. &#34;PLUS&#34;<br /><br />FRIENDS, LOVERS OR NOTHING: A great outro. The lyrics are nice and it's somewhat more upbeat compared to some of these tracks. Somewhat catchy. No complaints. &#34;PLUS&#34;<br /><br />I disagree with any and everyone who says that this album is one that you can put on once and then never play again. Ever. That's not how we should do John Mayer. Give him a chance. If I hadn't given him a second glance after my first listen, I wouldn't really have more than two favorite songs. All in all, give it a chance (more than one, preferably) and make up your own mind.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I recommend buying this unless you are a big fan though. But I do recommend that you at least borrow it from someone or the library. I'm glad I got a hold of these tracks.<br /><br />One thing can be said though: This CD isn't instantly catchy like most mindless pop is. You have to let it sink in. It gives you something to think about really. But if you're not up for that, then for the most part, you can skip this entire release and just listen to WHO SAYS on la radio.<br /><br />Save for the cover track, John Mayer wrote all of these 11 tracks by himself which shows skill. Not everyone can do that (or much less tries to). If there is one thing and one thing only you take from this review, know that this CD is LAID-BACK. Not Norah Jones laid-back, but laid-back all the same. That's just John's style. No, I don't think this compares to his last release, but then again, I think this, of the four releases, is actually his worst.<br /><br />I listened to ROOM FOR SQUARES for months and months straight when I first got it. I had heard nothing like it before. HEAVIER THINGS, although it was stolen from me, had some hidden treasures on it like BIGGER THAN MY BODY, the upbeat and awesome ONLY HEART and the I-was-listening-to-it-before-it-got-big-breakout-track DAUGHTERS. Then CONTINUUM came out and wow, that was bluesy. I DON'T TRUST MYSELF (WITH LOVING YOU) was my favorite track for a long time on the disc. Said track even got played at my local Denny's!<br /><br />3.5 stars.<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />Heartbreak Warfare<br />All We Ever Do Is Say Goodbye<br />Friends, Lovers Or Nothing<br />Do You Know Me<br />Edge Of Desireease, but then again, I think this, of the four releases, is actually his worst.

B000E33VWW|5.0|I viewed this film everal years ago on my son's BIG screen in his movie room.  A terrific film
B001AVCFJM|5.0|There is a lot of people that didn't like the new movie - they practically had a stroke over what Abrams did.  They complained about how everything was different and contradicted everything in Trek over the last 40+ years.  1) They obviously did pay attention to the movie (all these changes were explained...logically I might add) 2) They just don't want to accept the fact that the Star Trek timeline finally came crashing down.  Whenever time travel is featured in an episode of Trek - much effort is put into the characters preserving the timeline.  Not in this movie - it shows us how with one change - everything changes...and BOOM a totally alternate time line is born erasing EVERYTHING we know.    I thought it was very clever how it was executed; it opens the door for an entirely new world of Star Trek.  One of the problems I've had with the franchise - is that in some episodes of previous series' some things were contradicted which was something we had known to be 'cannon' in prior episodes/series'.  The way this movie was done...the future of the franchise now has a clean slate to work with and will never have to worry about 'keeping true to cannon'.    I loved the movie and I admit - I saw it 5 times in the theatre.  I didn't think I was going to like it because it was a 'rewrite' of everything I had seen of the 'original cast'.  When I saw the first preview - I was very eager to see it.  While the movie does LITERALLY REWRITE everything that the last 40+ years of Star Trek has been - it did it with classic Trek style.      My only qualm with the DVD is that art work on the cardboard sleeve and the DVD case its self.  I knew the sleeve was going to be as pictured - but I was hoping the case would have been more like one of the movie posters; on the front is a tight face shot of Chris Pine and on the back is a tight face shot of Zachary Quinto.  Not very exciting or artistic.  The bonus features are great; (many of the deleted scenes I feel should have been kept in the movie).

B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I've read all of Dan Brown's book and I must say, after waiting a couple of years for the release of this \\"ultra-secretive\\" and guarded book, I must say I was disappointed by the anticlimactic \\"The Lost Symbol\\". Don't get me wrong, I liked almost all his other books, but \\"The Lost Symbol\\" just doesn't deliver on the premises it builds upon in the first chapters. Like all of Dan Brown books, \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is very much written like a movie, but something was different about this one, almost as if he tried to make it too much like a movie on purpose. I was actually very curious to see where the story would take the very interesting field of Noetics and the impact of the reveal of \\"The Lost Symbol\\" to the masses. But I must say, after all the runaround of what now have become the same exact characters and predictable Robert Langdon/ Smart Female Love Interest/ Devoted Villain/ And Supporting cast, the story falls absolutely flat. I hate to say it, but the last 25% of the book were extremely predictable, had me wishing I would be proven wrong, but I wasn't. This book delivered what could be the worse ending that I've ever read in my entire life, and with the \\"impact\\" of the release of the \\"lost word\\" all I could say is, so what?! This book could very well cast Dan Brown back to his days as an unknown writer with the likes of \\"Deception Point\\" and \\"Digital Fortress\\". Quite possibly the death of Robert Langdon and his \\"insert different conspiracy here\\" stories.  Truly Disappointing.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|[[ASIN:B001MYIXAC Let The Right One In]] This new release has all the whistles and bells you could want. Swedish and English languages, but more importantly, four sets of subtitles to choose from. Not having seen it in theaters in 2008, I relied on what those who did told me about the release from Magnet (Magnolia Home Entertainment.) I was afraid that I'd get the version that the fans hated, but I got The Right One. I invited a couple of those \\"theatrical version fans\\" over to watch and they loved it. I just wish that the deleted scenes hadn't been deleted from the movie. The scene where Oskar takes his frustration out on Eli is heart-breaking and should have been left in. But someone needs to tell that girl to wipe her mouth after eating. That kiss was messy.<br />DH<br /><br />BTW, in the last scene we'd all like to think that Eli taps, \\"I Love You\\" and Oskar taps, \\"Love You Back\\" but I'll bet that those who know Swedish and Morse Code will probably know that Eli taps, \\"ARE WE THERE YET\\" and Oskar taps, \\"Be Quiet And Go Back To Sleep.\\"<br />DH

B001OQCV24|2.0|====REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS=====<br /><br />I admit I was very disappointed in this film. In general I like disaster movies, but this film had a `made for TV movie' level of plot, combined with movie-level graphics. I just wasn't feeling the love. In particular I was frustrated by the main protagonist who somehow, we are supposed to feel sorry for. He neglects his family, has no clue about what's going on with his own children, and then takes his kids to Yellowstone, not once, but twice, during a time when the park has heightened volcanic activity. Yep. Dad of the year. To make matters worse, the actor never really seems excited about anything. He goes through major trauma, with no worries at all. He was a poor choice for that role. At least put some eye candy if I'm going to have to watch the character sleepwalk through his role.<br /><br />Plot devices seemed to have been lifted from War of the Worlds, including the divorced dad with the estranged kids, the newly involved wife, etc. I honestly could care less whether his daughter was potty trained or not and yet that was the comment we get to hear and nod at in the end. And of course the divorced dad and mom will get together at the end because, you know we need that sappy happy ending and the hero really suddenly now is daddy material. Yuck.<br /><br />The plot was quite juvenile. Particularly the ending with the speech by the scientist which was eyeball-rollingly sappy and wasted more time than the characters had.  The deaths of non-essential characters made no impact. It was like they took an edgy film and dumbed it down to make the PG13 rating. I am glad they saved the dog.

B0007TKNCY|5.0|Howard Hawks delivered the best screwball comedy ever made (in my opinion) with Bringing Up Baby. The film has been very underrated until recently (except for France where I think Truffaut and others brought light to it), but now has been given a spotlight that I think is much deserved. The absurdities in this film are so well dealt with by Hawks, that I cannot help but be captured every time I am able to see it. Absolutely genius.

B002PMV9FG|2.0|Harry Potter the books I have yet to read... But Harry Potter the movies I have seen and own all so far. I loved most of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire better then most of the other films (what with all the dragons and mermaids! And this was even before I read or saw Twilight and knew of Robert Pattinson - don't judge me, I'm weak and a \\"sucker\\" for a good vampire romance) And, although (according to my mom who has read all the books) there is apparently so much more then the films can show - I still liked all the films... That is until I saw The Half Blood Prince. It felt short and left me very much confused... To me it should have been either a double feature with the next film or like what they did in Underworld Evolution where you have a bit of a \\"prequel\\" feeling and then it goes into the next part of the story. I will buy The Half Blood Prince (probably not right away... wait for it to come down in price) as I am a bit of a collector and need to have all of a series, but I don't foresee watching this chapter very often.  I can only hope that the next film (I believe it is to be a two part-er?) will be back up to par with its predecessors. Fingers crossed!

B002NXSRX4|5.0|So this movie got a bad rap for its suspect CG effects.  Well, considering that probably 75% of the film was full CG or at least CG set extensions, etc. it's understandable that some of it didn't look photo realistic.  Hey, we didn't complain that great films like Return of the Jedi used matte paintings for its backgrounds.  So give the production team some slack.<br /><br />But anyway, how's the film itself as a live-action G.I. Joe film.  I think it's great.  Have the traditional costumes changed, sure, but that's the same arguement used against the Michael Bay Transformers films.  But this film was a blast to watch.  It was a full fleged popcorn movie at its core.  And that's all they producers wanted it to be.  A film that appeals to both fans and those who didn't know anything about G.I. Joe.  Big set pieces, big over the top action pieces.  And lots of cool futuristic military hardware.  The film is basically one action sequence after another.  And then there's even a plot in there too with a few twists.<br /><br />Actually, I'm looking forward to a sequel.

B001GM28HO|4.0|If you like to swallow spoonfuls of self-indulgent, shallow, materialistic banter then Lady Gaga's debut album `The Fame' is going to be right up your ally.  That isn't meant to be a diss by any means, but it is only realistic to call out Gaga's collection of meaningless tracks for what they really are.  There is no weight here whatsoever, but that is not the point.  In interviews she's been very clear that she doesn't care that her songs are pointless.  All she cares about is that they are fun.<br /><br />She succeeds.<br /><br />The four singles she released off this album are pretty representative of who Gaga is as an artist.  `Just Dance', the first single, is an infectious club track that makes mention of Gaga's love for liquor, boys and music.  `Poker Face' is laced with innuendo and capitalizes on slick beats and catchy lyrics.  While both of those tracks grow old over time, `LoveGame' and `Paparazzi' happen to stand tall as stellar pop tracks.  `Paparazzi' especially uses a darkly suggestive stalker story to express love in a wildly inventive way.  It may be the best track on the album.  `LoveGame' opens brilliantly (that beat IS sick) and continues with ferocity.<br /><br />I'm not afraid to say that this is one of my favorite singles of the year.<br /><br />The rest of the album is a little all over the place, from great to good to mediocre.  Songs like `The Fame' is cringe worthy in their poor quality, and `Eh, Eh' is just boring.  It was nice to see a different side to Gaga, but it was constructed horrifically.  `I Like It Rough' is a clich&eacute;d mess that just never really takes off the way it could have.  I enjoy her fearless display of overt sensuality, but this was just painful in its unoriginality.<br /><br />Songs like `Beautiful, Dirty, Rich' and `Money Honey' are deliciously tacky in their exploitation of Gaga's primary concern, money.  `Boys Boys Boys' capitalizes on her second foremost thought (you guessed it).  All three songs are fun and exciting regardless of the fact that they are nothing overly spectacular.  `Brown Eyes' is a different pace for Gaga, and it works rather well.  It's nice to see her do something different and not fall flat on her face.  It has a soft vulnerability about it that I like, but Gaga is above all else a strong and independent woman, and it shows on every track.<br /><br />The best tracks here (aside from `LoveGame' and `Paparazzi') are the infectious `Paper Gangster', complete with full on swagger that suits Gaga better than one may think, `Starstruck', which ignites with fiery bravado and funky atmosphere and the closing track `Summerboy', which exploits Gaga's vices with a spunk that isn't seen on most of the album.<br /><br />Personally, I'd rank the album like so:<br /><br />1) Summerboy<br />2) LoveGame<br />3) Paper Gangster<br />4) Paparazzi<br />5) Starstruck<br />6) Boys Boys Boys<br />7) Poker Face<br />8) Brown Eyes<br />9) Beautiful, Dirty, Rich<br />10) Just Dance<br />11) Money Honey<br />12) Eh, Eh<br />13) I Like It Rough<br />14) The Fame<br /><br />In the end I totally love this album, even if it is uneven in parts.  When it hits it hits hard, and even the `less than great' tracks have a quality about them that makes you want to listen anyways.  Gaga is a sensation (and who saw that coming?) and she'll continue to be so for a long time to come (her new single `Bad Romance' is already making waves).<br /><br />You might as well jump on the bandwagon now!nothing overly spectacular.  `Brown Eyes' is a different pace for Gaga, and it works rather well.

0307346617|5.0|The Zombie fan in me definitely couldn't resist when I saw \\"World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War\\" at the bookstore back in the Spring. I, for one, am a huge fan of the uber-gory zombie fiction that involves survival and what have you. I love \\"The Evil Dead\\" movies, Peter Jackson's \\"Dead Alive\\" and a lot others. Even further, Max Brooks, the man who wrote \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" had written it. I loved that book, so again, I couldn't resist.<br /><br />World War Z is not your typical zombie book: It's done in the mockumentary style of writing that has been done back in the past. It's sort of a play on Al Gore's \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\", and brilliantly so! I really ended up liking this book, especially in unique style and in substance. You can tell that Max Brooks is a horror buff, as am I. And most of all, it's very convincing! There's also supposed to be a movie of this later in the year.<br /><br />A virus has out-broken across the world, thus causing people to turn into zombies. Max Brooks, a specialist in Zombie Fiction, is one of the survivors, and travels around the world talking to people who were there when it happened. The so-called \\"Zombie War\\" is referential to the point when almost half the world has turned to the living dead! Max interviews several people around the world, including people who fought in the war, people who lost their homes to the virus, people who lost friends to the virus, and more. Even more frightening, all this happens while the living dead still roam the streets.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book. Be it the documentary style or the zombie content, this book manages to thrill and entertain throughout the whole book. There are plenty of pop culture references to older zombie movies like \\"The Evil Dead\\", even an odd Iron Maiden reference, and lots of action. This book is really funny too! There's tons of dark humor underlying the story, and people worrying about being scared will have nothing to worry about, there's plenty of humor here.<br /><br />So In short, I really loved this book, and recommend it to horror buffs and fans of Zombie fiction!So In short, I really loved this book, and recommend it to horror buffs and fans of Zombie fiction!
0780021967|4.0|One of Hitchcock's major breakout films, `The 39 Steps' certainly feels like a Hitchcock movie.  It is briskly paced, thrilling and contains his signature `dark humor'.  In fact, there is a lot of salivate over here, but in the end this film leaves me wanting just a little more.  I completely expected to be blown away, but instead I was merely entertained, and so I'm left wondering just why this movie didn't take it that extra mile so-to-speak.<br /><br />The film revolves around a Canadian tourist in London who happens to come in contact with a beautiful spy who just so happens to get murdered in his flat.  Before she expires she hands him a map and utters three magic words; \\"the 39 steps.\\"  Being pursued by policemen for her murder, Richard (that is his name) takes it upon himself to do this young woman's job in order to clear his name.  Before long he is being pursued, not only by police but also by some very dangerous men intent of killing him.<br /><br />The big gimmick here is that whole `handcuffed' bit, which is what was mainly advertised about the film.  Yes, Richard meets Pamela, and they don't get along, and they wind up handcuffed together, but to be honest they are only handcuffed for about five minutes.<br /><br />For me, the film opens very strong, if not a tad confusing and very improbable (but what Hitchcock film doesn't skirt around the improbable).  It continues at a decent pace for a bit and then lags considerably for a while until the handcuffing starts and then my interest was peaked again (brilliantly played) and the film steamrolls from there at an intense and stirring pace until it ends, rather anticlimactically.<br /><br />I think I actually muttered, \\"that's it?\\" to myself.<br /><br />The best thing, by far, about this movie is Robert Donat.  He is just completely engrossing as Richard Hannay.  Even the scenes that seem to run stagnant are elevated by his beautifully fleshed out performance.  You can feel the unease and confusion racing through him, but he never loses his conviction.  It's an expertly realized performance.  Madeleine Carroll is also very well used in her scenes.  She does not have the amount of screen time one might think, for she is really only used in the films final stretch, but her chemistry with Donat is perfection.  She shifts from volatile to amenable to wholeheartedly supportive effortlessly.<br /><br />I'd recommend this one, because it is rewarding, but just realize that this is not the best Hitchcock has to offer.  He played a similar deck in 1959's `North by Northwest' with a much grander and fully realized result, but this 1935 gem is still well worth your time.tion.  It's an expertly realized performance.

0312360266|1.0|I was disappointed greatly with this book! Let me say that I am a fan of Vampire fiction, and I love teen fiction to death. So I decided I'd rent this book from the library to feed my curiosity. Let me say that while I thought there was lots of potential, I also felt that none of it was used well. It has an interesting concept (Vampire boarding school), despite being unoriginal. And it was executed in the way that was as interesting as watching a toilet flush. THe main character, Zoey, is so terribly Mary Sue. She needs everything to be perfect, she is dating the most popular guy in school, she is rich, etc. SHe complains when something she's not used to comes along, which is annoying. I also found this book to be extremely sexist. Not a single male character is strong at all, they're like mannequins in a clothing store. And almost NOTHING HAPPENS in this until the end, and when it does happen, it lasts two pages. A real disappointment, do skip this book. But then again, it's better than Twilight.
B002MRRRAA|3.0|Dave & Krist are great here as always. Both clearly smiling and enjoying playing the show. Kurt on the other hand plays like he'd rather be anywhere but on a stage. He's unusually sloppy and boring on the guitar and his singing lacks enthusiasm. Strange show to release on DVD when there are great shows like MTV's Live & Loud available where not only Kurt was set to ON for the night, but the entire band was amazing. Comparing the band playing this show in 1992 and the band playing Live & Loud in 1993 is fun to do. Is it even the same band? Were the members upgraded scientifically to be more awesome? They look healthier and happier, too, in the 93 show with Pat Smear. \\"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter\\" alone from that performances makes anything on this Reading show seem like stuff you'd hear from a local garage band ... in their garage. The DVD is good to see Krist having a great time, I always get a kick out of that. He knew how to enjoy each show just to be up there playing songs he liked. Check out the burst of enthusiasm when he turns on the distortion on his bass during the \\"D7\\" cover. If it weren't for Krist always jumping around, and the interpretive dancer here, Nirvana would've been a boring band to watch most of the time, since Kurt only moves around when he's not singing, and even then he often looks self-consciously zombie-like in his movements, except when he's throwing himself around lost in the music.

Several times, I celebrated still having two-thirds of the book left to read...more than half of the book left to read...almost half of the book left to read, etc. It was SUCH a joy. The only disappointing thing is knowing that some of the avenues that were left open for further books in the series will never be travelled.

B001AVCFK6|2.0|While the movie had a lot of cool CGI, the sets and locations were pathetic. A brewery with computer desks lined up by the vats? I admit it was hard to see with the flares though.  The actors did a fair job but the plot was unsophisticated and clumsy. Adding stupid twists to the well established Star Trek universe added up to a parody. This is not an acceptable work to add to the original vision. This is a low rent version that has none of the class of other Star Trek movies. It's really a shame this movie was made.

When Anna is thirteen, he sister's kidneys are failing.  After years of being forced to undergo medical procedures with no benefit to herself, Anna seeks medical emancipation from her parents.        This is a very controversial and emotional subject.  But, Picoult handles it masterfully.  Each chapter changes points of view so that we see how this illness affects everyone involved.  The characters are all very authentic characters faced with complicated questions that don't really have a right or wrong answer. While I cried more than once while reading, she also brings humor to the way the characters deal with the tragedy.       I put off reading this book because I expected it to be depressing. It was very sad, and the ending was not what I expected. But, it was well worth reading.

Of course \\"How Will I Know\\" & \\"I Wanna Dance With Somebody\\", and even \\"My Name Is Not Susan\\" are classic Whitney songs but \\"Million Dollar Bill\\" does nothing for me. It didn't seem to do anything on the charts either, peaking at #100 on the Billboard Hot 100. \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" is an outstanding song, and remake of the hit \\"A Song For You\\" is totally wicked.<br /><br />But Whitney, I will say that you do have that voice inside of you. Even though this album may not have been what you have done previously, but regardless you have made your mark. I highly doubt that anyone will ever forget \\"I Will Always Love You\\" or \\"I Wanna Dance With Somebody\\". I always here those songs if I ever go to a bar or club, more of a remix versions but it's still Whitney!<br /><br />Now I also did read that she will be going on tour, I wouldn't mind seeing her again. I did see her on the \\"Bodyguard Tour\\" and she was very astounding. Let's make it a good tour Whitney! =)
B0020TS5LK|2.0|I'm giving this Two Stars not because of the film itself but for the following three complaints I have with this disc (I'm a huge fan of the movies, I have all three and have watched them dozens of times):    1. Price: $25.49 is awfully expensive for a movie that's been out for 11 years.  Especially considering that much newer movies (e.g. \\"Watchmen: The Director's Cut\\", loaded with extras, btw) are going for lower.  The aforementioned \\"Watchmen\\" is nearly $10 cheaper.    Surely a $35 or $40 boxed set of all three Blade films could have been issued.    2. Quality of Transfer    The transfer is hardly stunning and hardly worth the aforementioned price.  Both my Blu-Ray player (a 120GB PS3, the very latest version of Sony's flagship console) and my HD-DVD player (a Toshiba A-30) upscale/up-res standard DVDs and I cannot tell the difference between THIS Blu-Ray transfer and the upscaled SD-DVD.  Thus I'm feeling more than a little taken advantage of.  Unfortunately, Amazon's policy limits me to a 50% refund, if they give me one at all.  This film is still part of the best Vampire franchise out there (so far), in my opinion, but stick to the standard DVD versions.  Not only do you get the extras, but since there's no discernible difference in picture quality, you'll also save yourself a good bit of cash.    3. No extras    Unfortunately, I missed the notice, which is just a single line of print, that no extras were included which scotches my reason for returning the disc.  Surely this notification should have been bolded or rendered in a different color, something that would catch the eye better.    Although, in general, I am not a big fan of extras (with certain exceptions, they are rarely worth watching), I think a Blu-Ray release should at least contain everything on the original DVD release.  After all, there's more than enough room on a BR disc to accommodate everything on a Standard DVD release since all BR videos are 50GB discs.  And \\"Blade\\" will fit on a 4.7GB DVD (i.e. a single layer disc) WITHOUT the extras.  Therefore, there's no reason NOT to include the extras given the huge amount of space the BR gives the studio for extra content.    Thus, if Blade requires 4.7GB of space for its 2 hours in Standard Definition, multiplying it by 6 (since we are constantly reminded that \\"Blu-Ray has SIX TIMES--!!!--the definition of DVD!\\"), that still leaves 26GB for extras, more than enough if these are left in standard def (as the majority of extras are).    Finally, as for the difference in aspect ratios: this is not an issue for me.  Both Blu-Ray and HD-DVD normally use a 2.40:1 ratio (resulting in slightly smaller black bars bordering the film) and, strictly, speaking, I suppose, the original aspect ratio should have been preserved.  However, the increase (?) in aspect ratio does NOT result in a distorted picture so I don't feel this is a drawback.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|I have been a Michael Jackson fan for as long as I can remember. My first vinyl album was \\"Bad\\" and my first compact disc was \\"Dangerous\\", also to add my first 45rpm single was \\"Smooth Criminal\\". He is the greatest entertainer that ever lived. On the day of his death, I was so shocked that I could not think right. Never in my life, have I ever felt depressed for a celebrity who I have never met.     I went to see \\"Michael Jackson's This Is It\\" and I will say, it was great! For a 50 year old guy, he still had it in him. Of course he was not performing as if he was on the \\"Bad\\" or \\"Dangerous\\" tours, but still very very well. I bought the soundtrack as well to the movie and I am just stunned that Sony records released another greatest hits package. While I do agree with some of the reviews, the sound quality is alot better than his previous greatest hit collections. But they did not include all of the songs that were rehearsed. I do not see \\"I Want You Back\\", \\"The Love You Save\\" & \\"I'll Be There\\". Possibly a mix of a label disagreement?, Motown and Epic?.     But I will say that the new and unreleased song \\"This Is It\\", is better than I expected. Because if Michael never released it back from the 1980's, I was thinking if his genius skills did not like the songs, then maybe it's supposed to stay unreleased. I disagree, the song is brillant and I love the sound of it. Even though it's a young Michael and not the later Michael voice I am used, it's still brillant.    As for Disc 2, The demos for \\"Wanna Be Startin Somethin\\", \\"She's Out Of My Life\\", & \\"Beat It\\" are brillant. This is Michael at his genius work. I love how he works and stating \\"more bass\\". I know there must be hundreds of demos out there that he has, I would love to hear demo's from the \\"Bad\\" and \\"Dangerous\\" eras, as well as the \\"History\\" and \\"Invincible\\" era. The poem of \\"Planet Earth\\" makes you sit down and think about the reality of this planet. Michael Jackson was a great humanatarin and was trying to \\"Heal The World\\" and make it peaceful world. With songs like \\"We Are The World\\", \\"Heal The World\\", \\"Man In The Mirror\\", \\"Earth Song\\", & \\"Cry\\". There are hardly any artists out there that make great songs about the planet, or should I say artists that get enough attention.    Rest In Peace Michael Jackson! You were and still are the true King Of Pop! Atleast I still have one Jackson family member to count on to keep my spirits up from loosing you, and that is Janet! After her performance on the \\"MTV Music Awards\\", she blew me away as she has in the past with her performances. She loved her brother so much, and I can tell how much shes hurting from his loss. We love you Michael!
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I wont go through the movie..goodness knows there are enough reviews on this fantastic action flick. I was going to rate it 4 stars, but then I saw the gag real..it is a lot of fun to watch, they spent time on this and it came out great!   If you are thinking about renting instead of buying i think the special features are worth the purchase.    I only have 1 question...when is the next one?
B002JM1VJG|5.0|First let me say Bravo to this incredible dvd.I read that people say some of the quality on some of the video's is not so good but i must of bought a special copy because the quality on all 47 video's are superb.It starts off with the classic video Burning up then goes to Lucky Star,And finally Erotica & Justify My Love were released on dvd. My disapoinment is the video Justify My Love & They said that 1.There is new footage added to the video & There is not & 2. The video is censored at the end when the woman who is topless wearing just suspendors walks over to the guy and you see her breat & A nipple & There is a black bar over her breast(The original video has no black bar).What i don't get is that when Justify My Love was released on Vhs as a video single it is NOT edited at all so why edit the dvd years later when sex is something alot more accepted then it was when it wasn't censored on the vhs that i do own (I think they should of put an advisory sticker or you have to be 18 to buy it but don't censor a video EVERYONE HAS BEEN WAITING TO BE AVAILABLE). so back to all the positives,After the classic video Lucky Star we go into Like a virgin and after that video & 17 video's later we end disc 1 with I'll Remember.Then disc 2 starts wth Secret followed by Take a bow then Bedtime Stories into The UNedited version of Human Nature then The rare not shown alot video I Want You,followed by You'll see(many people don't know this song is a sequal to \\"TAKE A BOW\\" The video's follow each other) There is also a video for You'll see but it's sung in spanish Called (Veras)It's not the same video as You'll See but similar.Then you go into the next video The Haunting & Beautiful Frozen then Ray of light and then there are 17 more video's and it ends with the title song Celebration. I wish she would have added the following video's to make it a complete collection & The following video's have never been put on dvd. The list is as such:    1.Everybody 2.Holiday 3.Dear Jessie(Only aired in europe)4.This used to be my playground 5.Hey You 6.True Blue(The American Version,She released The eruopean version on This dvd which is gr8 but i wish she put both) 7.Veras(You'll see The spanish version & The Video is very different then the You'll see video,You cn see it on you tube) 8.Britney spears & Madonnas Me Against The Music 9.American life(Neither version is on the dvd or any dvd.I feel both of them should be released) 10.GHV2 Mega Mix Video(Her recored company made this incredible mega mix cd i am lucky enough to own it was a promotional thing only and video)11.Celebration Version 2(There is a 2nd video that has her daughter Lourdes in it wearing the Like a Virgin wedding dress & BoyToy belt,Pretty different video from the original) 12.Paradise(not for me) 13.Oh Father    All in All this is an outstanding collection ,I guess we all want more and that's why i'd love to have those additional 13 video's well make it 14 video's re-release Justify My Love UN-edited or maybe she could release just those 13 or 14 video's(Justify my love unedited) and call it \\"Lets Celebrate more\\" That would be a great sales angle & it would sell like crazy and make her even more $$$$$ money $$$$$. BUT i give this collection an A+++++++++++++++++++++++++ :-) :-) :-) :-) This is worth every $$$$$$$ Dime.I also HIGHLY recommend The video Collection 93-99.It has 14 Video's & has 5 video's not on the Celebration Collection.The Immaculate Collection DVD only has 1 video not on either of the other 2 collections and that's her amazing video Oh Father & Has The really awsome Live performance Vouge @ the 1990 MTV Awards show. So if YOU are a huge fan like me then all 3 collections is a must but 93-99 collection & Celebrations collection are very worth it.Very very very worth it!!!!!!    ~Thanks Johno
B002N3GD2Q|5.0|This is the best sounding live 'doors' show around.    You can hears bits and pieces on other compilations and box sets but not even close to all of the music contained here.    Now its all in the same box at a reasonable price.    I was disappointed by 'Boot Yer Butt' because of the awful sound quality, 'Live in NY' is the exact opposite!    A must have for any 'doors' fan.
B002N8A14M|5.0|When I ordered my 5th generation Nano, I knew I needed to find an accessory that did three things:<br /><br />-A case to protect the Nano from damage.<br />-An armband to use when I run or work out in warm weather.<br />-An integrated belt clip to use when I run or work out in cold weather, or for simply wearing the Nano around casually.<br /><br />I was happy to find this product, as it had all three features I was looking for, and the price was great (1/2 price on Amazon).<br /><br />I was even happier when it arrived, as it exceeded all my expectations. The case is clear plastic (It's completely transparent on the front side where it's important to get a clear view of the screen, and it's frosted on the back side). The case is super easy to open and to insert or remove the Nano----yet it closes very securely with a snap and gives a nice sense of protection. In other words, they struck a good balance with making a secure, tight closure, while at the same time not making it difficult to open it when needed (my last case for a previous iPod was awful to take off). The way it works is the bottom part separates from the top part, and the seam where they meet lands nicely right at the bottom of the Nano's screen, maintaining a virtually seamless, sleek look. (By the way, the case does completely cover the screen; I've seen where others were disappointed with other cases that did not. This one does; the only opening on the front is for the clickwheel.)<br /><br />The design of the case is flawless as far as I can tell. It fits all the openings of the Nano like a glove; the openings are perfectly placed and perfectly designed. There's no problem reaching/using the clickwheel, there's full access to the Nano's connectors on the bottom as well as to the hold button on the top, and there's a perfectly placed opening for the Nano's camera/mic on the back of the case. It actually seems like the case was designed by Apple alongside the design of the Nano; in my opinion, that's how integrated they are.<br /><br />The integrated clip attached to the back of the case is nice, and it's a feature I plan to use a lot. There is also a way to lift the clip so that it becomes a stand for setting the Nano sideways on a table for viewing videos, pictures, etc. (I personally won't use this feature, because I feel that in time, it might stress the plastic of the clip and cause it to break.)<br /><br />The armband is wonderful. Again, flawless design. The clip on the back of the case is slipped into a narrow pocket on the outside of the armband, for a secure fit. The armband is very simple to use and it's also very comfortable. It's nicely padded, soft on the inside, and the elastic is secure, but stretchy, so it doesn't feel like it's cutting off my circulation.<br /><br />I can't come up with a single complaint. I feel this is the best case out there, and definitely the best case/armband combo, especially for those who also want a belt clip option. High-quality and flawless design, easy to use, secure protection for my Nano, and all the features I was looking for.rated clip attached to the back of the case is nice, and it's a feature I plan to use a lot.

B001AVCFK6|3.0|(HERE BE SPOILERS MATEY)     Pros - Great scenes, great cast, great action, just funny enough, and overall a fun movie to watch.      Cons - Why oh why did they have to do a g.d. time travel movie huh?? It will inevitably fail every common sense test.  It seemed to reek of a poor excuse to get Leonard Nimoy into the movie.  The antagonist's motivation is that his family/home/planet are destroyed and he blames Spock.  So after getting crapped back in time he goes tear assing around the universe looking for Spock so he can serve a slice of revenge pie.  Revenge plot, okay i get that, but it all stemmed from the fact that spock was just a few seconds too late to save the planet.  So now, having a few extra decades to warn and prepare, why not just tell Spock to skip the second cup of coffee, leave 5 minutes earlier and be done with it. Planet saved, hooray.     My two cents; rather than sweep all the \\"trek\\" history right into the garbage on a flimsy and lame time travel plot, just to get Nimoy in it, why not have Nimoy narrate the story from the beginning?  I always thought a great-grandson asking how great-grandpa met \\"Uncle Jim\\" would have been cool.  Just saying...    Time travel has a ditinct \\"done that\\" feel, especially in Star Trek.  It all just seemed like the story was rushed through and all the attention went to the visuals.    Bottom line:  I'm buying the Blu-Ray cause it looks and sounds awesome, but the plot will always grate me a bit.
B001KVZ6G6|2.0|This is a wonderful movie with a beautiful story, but it is not a movie for really little kids.  Our 2 year old son was in tears for much of the movie, upset with what was happening, and I am pretty sure not understanding the underlying story.  Some of the violence was a bit too much, with the villian shooting at the kid at one point. Again, I thought it was a good movie, but not for the same audience as Finding Nemo or Monsters Inc.
B002HWRYJE|2.0|The effects were eye catching. The casting was ok. Sylar made a good Spock and so did Spock. The story was bad Star Trek. The Star Trek creators made up their own universe complete with rules and history which they generally followed and the fans scrutinized. This story light movie disregarded all of that with no attempt to write a story of similar weight or potential.     You are watching a new story that just wanted to dress up like Spock and the gang so you would not demand that the movie stand up on its own merits. They want to claim Star Wars as inspiration, but Star Wars told a story set in space. Star Wars did not talk about science fiction themes or use science fiction plot devices and still didn't abuse the science fiction genre like this silly work.     The story was bad science fiction. People sky dive from the void of space and stop with parachutes. If a single star goes nova, the whole galaxy is destroyed. Travel time Earth to Vulcan, about 20 minutes. Time required for one bad guy to destroy a fleet of ships, about 5 minutes. Time required destroying a planet, about 20 minutes. Oh the nova; easily stopped by a floating drop of red paint.    Original Star Trek made some effort to exceed its racist and sexist times. If you watch the old show carefully you notice that Uhura outranked Sulu and Chekov. What is easier to see is that she never gave an order to anyone and played the role of miniskirt secretary. Later Star Trek offerings gave a stronger role to characters like Uhura, which is to say not white and/or male, doing better at this than the original show. So what makes Uhura memorable in the latest Star Trek movie? Who she smooches and what kind of underwear she's hiding.    Star Trek the 20 something generation is a step backward, even from the original show.
1563896656|5.0|I'd started with the paperback of Vol.1, and loved it -- I enjoyed playing Spot the Reference -- and got the hardback Vol.2 and Black Dossier. Thinking it would be nice to have an all-hardback set, I kept my eyes open. Spotted it on Amazon and leapt. The seller got it to me quickly and in great condition (though used) as promised.

B0029O08WA|4.0|This soundtrack is a different beast than the Twilight soundtrack...more indie and definitely darker.  That being said, I really enjoy about 67% of this CD (yep, I ran the numbers).  I'll quickly list the songs I'm not enjoying: Meet Me on the Equinox (I have yet to make it thru the whole song, and I've tried 4 times), Hearing Damage (REALLY don't like this one), Roslyn, Done All Wrong and The Violet Hour.  The last three aren't horrible, but they just didn't click with me.      Now for the ones I like.      Friends and I Belong To You - the two catchiest numbers on the soundtrack; I like singing along with them.  I'm enjoying the slightly different take Muse did with the latter. I didn't expect them to actually make the song a little bouncier than the version on their CD \\"The Resistance\\" so that was a surprise, and I'm very glad they kept the sax solo.     Possibility - haunting; love it.    White Demon Love Song - my intro to The Killers and I will definitely be listening to them more.  I really like how it builds throughout; the sound just keeps getting bigger.    Satellite Heart - Anya Marina has a very distinctive voice that could be annoying for some people, but the song is solid and   definitely makes me think of Bella.    Monsters - I don't know why, I just like it. I really want to see where this one ends up placed in the movie (werewolves, Volturi?)    Shooting the Moon - definitely working some guitar in this one, Ok Go say this song was created around the time they were working on their newest album (out in 2010?) and that it fits into the direction they are starting to take.  I'll be interested to hear that album.  A bit of a \\"swing\\" to this one.    Slow Life - a solid song; I especially liked the chorus. I may check out some Grizzly Bear songs.    No Sound But The Wind - well after hearing the very distinctive vocal tones of the Editor's lead singer I think I will recognize their songs anywhere (already caught one on TV's \\"The Vampire Diaries\\").  Lovethe song, but I'm not sure where the title of this track came from. Sad, but lovely.    And finally...The Meadow - I was absolutely thrilled with this track; if I hadn't already pre-ordered the score I would've after hearing this piece.  THIS was what Edward should've been playing to Bella in Twilight - or something along these lines (Burwell's lullaby is a pretty piece - but NOT a soothing lullaby).  Lovely and haunting piano work in this.  It is the highlight of the CD to me and I am anxiously awaiting the entire score.    I'm really glad to have been introduced to some new artists with this CD and I think Alexandra Patsavas did a great job pulling it together.  A big thanks to Chris Weitz as well for getting Muse on this soundtrack - I hope they're on the next one also.  I can see why many people prefer the first soundtrack, as the tone is a little more upbeat and the songs feel more polished.  I love that CD and found some new artists on that one, too - number one being Muse, and what a fantastic find that was!  This CD is a more challenging listen, but after playing it for a month I think I enjoy it almost as much and am looking forward to seeing where everything fits in the movie.  I think I'll appreciate each song even more after that.    Edit 11-28-09: Well, having seen where everything fits in the movie, I am VERY impressed.  \\"Monsters\\" actually has to do with the hidden monsters around Forks (esp. Victoria), so that was a surprise.  Even songs I don't care for really fit their scenes.  But what blew me away was \\"Hearing Damage\\"! This is still not a song I'll listen to on its own, but the way it is placed in the movie is simply incredible.  Like a great soundtrack song should, it highlights and emphasizes the scene it is in - so kudos to Thom Yorke, Chris Weitz and Peter Lambert (editor). Also, note that \\"The Meadow\\" is exclusive to this soundtrack like all the other songs - it is not on the score CD (which is stunning in its own right).

0385504225|5.0|Thanks Dan Brown, you did it again.  You captured my imagination and made me sit up late nights reading to finish your over 500 page book. This was a easy read and quite intriguing the links made between religion or more specifically the Bible and the masonic order.<br /><br />Great Book!!!
B002QEXN2K|2.0|I expected a lot more. It took 3 years to release this album. It has no substance and nothing worth clinging on to. Not worth getting. what happened john???
0307454541|1.0|A friend who read it in its original language loved the book, so I eagerly awaited the English translation. I read less than a chapter. The English is clunky. The expressions are dated, as though the translator learned English in the 1970s. Update: I have since learned that the publisher had the American translation edited by a non-American, and the American translator took his name off the book because the translation now sounded so bad.
B002MU4NL8|5.0|What a treat to see this movie hit Blue-Ray. An underapreciated brilliant masterpeice of a comedy. The movie has a collection of awesome characters played to perfection by a brilliant cast, and Weaver looks amazing in this film. Her best ever in my opinion, and she's no spring chicken. Good for her. A true Alien-Movie legend, in an great roll, looking super. Galaxy Quest is a truly fun movie that will make you laugh, make you care, and entertain you from start to finish. That's the point afterall, isn't it. \\"COOL\\"!
B002CLBJPK|3.0|Quick, what movie features Britain in turmoil, three young children growing up under the tutelage of a sorceress, invocations of ancient demons and wizards, curse spells, and a modern school of magic that's not what it appears to be? Nope, it's not Harry Potter...it's Bedknobs and Broomsticks!<br /><br />It's the beginning of World War II and Miss Price (Angela Lansbury, looking suitably spinsterish) has been saddled with three British war orphans: Charlie (Ian Weighill), Carrie (Cindy O'Callaghan) and Paul Rawlins (Roy Snart). Although she prefers to keep to herself, Price has no choice but to take them under her wing, at least until a more proper home can be found for them.  As it turns out, Miss Price is a witch, a witch who hopes to help the British war effort if only she can master the final level of her training and thereby learn the spell \\"substitutiary locomotion.\\"<br /><br />The three orphans eventually stumble upon her secret.  In an unlikely series of deals and skullduggery, Price bargains with the orphans to keep her secret in exchange for some magic, a bed knob that transforms any bed into a dimension-traveling device. Soon after, Price discovers that her tutoring via post from the mysterious Professor Emelius Browne (David Tomlinson), headmaster of the College of Witchcraft, has come to an abrupt end.  Using the bed knob, Price and the three children track down Browne, who is in fact a con man that doesn't know much about magic at all.<br /><br />Thus begins a quest to find the elusive substitutiary spell, first via double-dealings with a bookseller who has the other half of a mysterious spellbook, and then to an animated world of talking animals in pursuit of an amulet with the magic words inscribed upon it.  Along the way, the motley band will face down the King of the Beasts, a razor-wielding thug, and of machinegun-toting Nazis.<br /><br />Bedknobs and Broomsticks shows its age, both in its narrative speed and its approach to mature themes.  The musical numbers often meander, with the characters speaking their lines and dance routines that are far too aggressive for the two older protagonists.  There are a few misogynistic references (met with a frown by Miss Price) and...well, it's all very British, as it should be.

0596522347|1.0|This book is amazing in that it is a book on presentation and  is simultaneously a fine example of how NOT to present something. The print is far too small and is a faded grey. How in all the world could someone who put this much effort and care into a book - I did manage to read some of it - fail to notice that it is nearly unreadable?
B0028OF7TA|5.0|I already owned 4 of 5 Vinyl Albums in this collection and was considering buying the individual CDs until I found this item (Michael Jackson The Collection).  Playing them on my stereo for the first time brought be back to the 70s and 80s with the sound quality I had been missing all these years.  In addition to all the original album tracks, there are great bonus tracks with interviews and original demos! I was able to obtain these great albums again without spending an arm and a leg.  Brings me back to my youth and worth the money in my opinion.  Each CD is in a protective sleeve with original album cover art on it (Way COOL!).  There will be no other like Michael Jackson again and his music will live on forever.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|My review is simple this Star Trek really Rocks! My favorite villian will still always be the late Richardo Montalban's \\"Khan\\" but Nero from this film comes in a close second in my book. Lets face it we all saw the hand writing on the wall when Star Trek 6 The Undiscovered Country was made. The series was getting tired out and the actors who played these beloved characters were aging. Star Trek needed to be made from another point of view and J.J. Abrams took that baby in his arms and lovingly caressed it and nurtured it to on its way to grow in a new way. The child is near adult now and ready to begin new adventures in the next film guided hopefully by J.J.'s capable hands. Having been a trekker from the beginning of Star Trek I went into the movie with great trepedation but came out of the theatre with tears of joy as a believer. Yes my friends Star Trek has been re-born and this baby will live long and prosper!

1594488916|2.0|Ken Sanders is a Salt Lake City rare book dealer who also worked as the volunteer security chair of the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America. Through his initiative a stolen-book e-mail hot-line was established that led to the capture of John Gilkey, who used bad-checks and stolen card card numbers (mostly acquired working at SAKS) to acquire an estimated $100,000 worth of stolen antique books. Praise to Ken Sanders and the cooperative and alert police, boo to John Gilkey and the author who tries to romanticize Gilkey's life and motives. (She even visits one of Gilkey's crime scenes with him, where Gilkey is recognized by the owner.) The entire story should have been summarized into two or three pages.<br /><br />The only other point of interest was reading what I have long suspected - that eBay has a reputation as the largest legalized fence of stolen property in the world, avoiding liability because it lacks a physical location for its auctions, and technically is not hosting them. A Washington Post article (01/06/2005) adds that thieves used eBay to net far more than normal for fenced goods. Industry representatives contend that eBay makes selling stolen goods so easy that perpetrators are lured into doing so.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Tell everyone you know, especially those you care about, to see this documentary.  It really is shocking what we are being fed, and I don't mean that just in a literal sense!<br /><br />For those considering buying or watching the DVD.  The documentary moves at a good pace. It doesn't deliberately seek to shock you with graphic scenes, or express a bias that we should all become vegetarians. What it does do is take the veil off the packaging to reveal many ugly and hidden truths. The good thing here is that KNOWLEDGE IS POWER and our power is visible with each food item we choose to purchase.<br /><br />Many thanks to the brave makers of this film.  Polyface Farm--you rock!<br /><br />[...]. Worth taking a look there.
1416594787|5.0|A very good read.  A couple of pages each from over 200 of the world's top scientists.  If you are pushed for time this allows you to read say two to six pages and then get on with the days activities while digesting what you have read.  And if you are not pushed for time you will certainly want to read on.  Great to have such a volume from scientists who are easy to read and on top of their respective callings.  You will come away from this book happy in the information it has presented to you.  Enjoy.  Don Mantack
B002MEW7YY|3.0|While I prefer Lucia in a more Scottish, earlier period than this production was set, I have to say I didn't have qualms with the staging/design. (other than the Wolfscraig scene- which seemed to be an afterthought as it was nearly non-existant - truly an embarrassment).   I found the production interesting and in fact liked the photographer in the sextet one reviewer found problem with ... if you had seen Annick Massis in this production you would have seen just how effective the play in this setting, used exquisitely to show her resentment and refusal to participate in this wedding 'arrangement'.  Lucia's opening scene was one of the finest moments of staging I had seen at the Met's theatre, breathtakingly beautiful, but sloppy camerawork / editing diffused if not dismissed it's effect entirely in film for this DVD ... Lucia and her nursemaid walking through the heather'd countryside with a light snowfall following their steps ... beautiful -  Which, is more than I can say for the singing in this performance in general - as previously noted, Anna Netrebko does not possess the \\"belcanto\\" schooling or innate vocal athleticism which is required in this role.  The Met continues to do her a disservice by casting her in belcanto roles which illuminate her weaknesses in what I must say IS a beautiful voice (and it goes without saying she's a BEAUTIFUL woman) ... but, not for the belcanto roles of maestro Donizetti.   Beczala does a servicable job as a last minute substitute for the Edgardo, again, without a doubt a preferred substitution ~ Kwiecien makes for a menacing brother, abet a little lackluster in vocal performance but a pleasing characterization.  As frequent, the show is stolen by the fantastic Metropolitan Opera CHORUS who gain this productions top honors!! Expectations were high, but this performance failed to deliver anything but a serviceable outing of this Donizetti jewel.
B002H3F7F6|4.0|I really like Sting's audacity and interest in performing early music.  His voice suits the music most of the time especially when he is singing with the rest of the performers.  I might have like more individual instrumention on the part of the others in the group.  My favorite song is \\"Soul Cake\\" which come across more like Sting's usual work. Also \\" Christmas at Sea\\"  was very geraphic building a visual seascape and sailing experience with hte words.\\"  If you like Sting's music and can accomodate his renditions of more traditional early music than you will like this recording.

B000002B7O|5.0|Diary Of A Madman is the follow up to the Hugely Succesful Ozzy solo Debut Blizzard of Ozz and it is a Masterpiece! It's hard to follow up Classics but leave it to Ozzy to do just that.Diary opens with \\"Over the Mountain\\" a blistering chug a chug drum and guitar heavy track and is followed by the insane \\"Flying High Again\\" which who cant mention the late great Randy Rhoads's Amazing Axework on this and other Tracks.Unfortunately this would be his last album with Ozzy as he died in a devastating plane crash.\\"You Cant Kill Rock and Roll\\" is a catchy guitar driven track with some Amazing vocals.One i would like to see Ozz do live someday.\\"Little Dolls and \\"Diary of a Madman\\" to me are Great haunting tracks that make Ozzy's voice take the listener to another world.The Ballad \\"Tonight\\" is one of my favorite of his and it fits the Album well.Overall 10/10 again for Ozz.

If you read Tuesdays with Morrie, you'll understand what I mean when I say that the book is written in such a way that you feel like you're having a chat with the author, Mitch Albom.  He has the ability to draw you into the experience he's sharing with you. It is a heartwarming, sometimes funny, always authentic story of the author's experiences as he prepares to write a respected special friend's eulogy.<br /><br />I have three copies which I bought after reading this book.  They will be Christmas gifts to two close friends and a family member. I have told everyone I know to read the book.  I hope they do...
B000TXG3YA|5.0|My guitar teacher and I always speak of finding music that is unique and unlike anything in the mainstream, to find music that comes from the heart and not the company chair of power. Of course, such a form of music is sometimes hard to find, but is something I discovered in Baroness. And ironically enough, this band has met a lot of success with this record!    \\"Red Album\\" is a true novelty, for metal music and for music in general. I usually describe the songs on an album track by track, but there's so much in each of these songs, such a form of description would be quite complicated. Fortunately, the album is easy enough to describe as a whole. The album is a combination of experimental progressive-rock, Mastodon-influenced sludge-metal complete with vocals influenced by Troy of Mastodon, southern guitar harmonies and just a generally experimental and melodic vibe, tinged with garage-style jams. They even go into a fully acoustic instrumental, which makes for a nice change in feel and tempo.    Overall, this is hands-down a five-star album and a modern classic. Highly recommended, this album is breaking new and unique ground in metal that I sure hope will be walked on in the near future. Also, Baroness's second album \\"Blue Record\\" is very highly recommended, too. Thanks for the time, and peace.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This is one of my favourites and is one of the best comedies out there. For $15 this is more then worth it.    Amazon's shipping very very disappointing, it took them forever to ship it.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|The 1950's was the golden age of science fiction, many great films were made, that even now influence our lives and thoughts today. One such film is Forbidden Planet, and for me. It is still one of the best films-and perhaps the only film that has a unique sound track which can not be beaten. Not only that but it introduced one of the best great robots of all time - Robby, this robot is so iconic, it-or he is instantly recognisable.<br /><br />Before I go on, I just have to say that the music for the film was and still is ahead of its time, and if you watch the credits it comes under `Electronic Tonalities' by Louis and Bebe Barron, this inspiring couple used no musical instruments to compose the weird and wonderful music of Forbidden Planet; and if you look at the theatrical posters of the time, this couple's names are not mentioned - the Academy didn't even recognised the film score as music-how ignorant is that? Because no actual musical instruments were used, Louis and Bebe used tape and electronics to compose the now unforgettable haunting sound for the film. In my mind both Louise and Bebe Barron should receive honorary Oscars for original film score-its well overdue.<br /><br />Now as for the acting skills of the performers, Walter Pidgeon is perfectly cast as Dr.  Edward Morbius, you don't know wether to love him or pity him in his struggle with his Id, and over developed intellect. Then there's the lovely Anne Francis as Altaira, Morbius' daughter, beautiful, naïve, and bright. Leslie Nielsen as Commander J. J. Adams, strong and heroic. Warren Stevens as Dr. Ostrow-unusual name, wise, intelligent, a close friend of the commander. It seems there are shades of the Kirk and McCoy between these two men, as the characters/actors work well together. Jack Kelly as Lt. Jerry Farman, another friend of Adams, a likeable easy going guy, obviously a ladies man. Plus two other recognisable actors early in their careers are Richard Anderson (Six Million Dollar Man/Bionic Woman), as Chief Quinn, and Earl Holliman (Police Woman), as  Cook, giving a light comedic touch to the film. A well balanced cast in my opinion.<br /><br />Okay, let's look at this 50th Anniversary Edition of Forbidden Planet, first when it states that it is the Ultimate Collector's Edition, you must never use the word `Ultimate' because it implies it contains everything and anything-well this edition-doesn't-of course thus you'll end up scrutinising it no end-and yes you guess it, I'm going to do just that; let's have a look at what you get anyway:<br /><br />1] Forbidden Planet (Widescreen)<br />2] The Invisible Boy (Widescreen-bonus movie feathering Robby)<br />3] 17 Lobby Cards (reproductions 5A size-approx of both films)<br />4] Forbidden Planet - Deleted Scenes and Lost Footage<br />5] Excerpts from `The MGM Parade' TV series with Walter Pidgeon<br />6] `Client' episode with Robby from the TV series `The Thin Man'<br />7] 3 Documentaries: `Amazing! Exploring the Far Reaches of Forbidden Planet', `Robby the Robot: Engineering a Sci-Fi Icon', and `TCM Original Watch the Skies!: Science Fiction, the 1950s and Us'<br />8] Science-Fiction Movie Trailer Gallery<br />9] 3.5\\" figure of Robby the Robot<br /><br />All the above is presented to you in  a tin case-which is itself worth getting.<br /><br />Now in regards the Robby the Robot figure, which was one of the main reasons I got this DVD Edition. I am really disappointed because there is a little false advertising involved, if one looks at the back of the box, the figure of Robby is about 21cm tall, compared to the other merchandize shown,  but in reality it is about 9cm (3.5\\" inches tall), even though it states in small print that the figure is 3.5\\" Actual Size. (Even on the Amazon website picture shows what I mean) It is obvious that the Marketing Department wanted to sucker us in-well it worked with me, and looking at the metal box it came in, you can easily fit a 6\\" inch Robby figure. So the point is don'tbe fooled-seeing is not believing.<br /><br />So is this really the Ultimate Edition-well no, because there's no such thing, I mean if we are featuring Robby as a bonus in what he has done over the years, then two more acting skills should have been included in this 50th Anniversary Edition: 1] the Lost in Space episode, \\"The War of the Robots\\" and 2] the Ark II episode, \\"The Robot\\", (this episode showed Robby with a different look than what we are used too) and there are more, of course like than appearance in Wonder Woman for example.<br /><br />Plus there are two other things I would like with this edition, a booklet, describing the movie, some production notes, cast & crew listing, and any trivia, as well as a CD of the original Film/Music sound track. Why is it that special, anniversary or collector editions don't have CD sound tracks, I'm sure the collector would like to hear the musical score-wouldn't you?<br /><br />All in all this 50th Anniversary Edition of Forbidden Planet is cool, and the film is my third all-time favourite sci-fi film, and it's easy to see why. You can get just the double DVD without the Robby figure, but if you go that far-go the extra, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />One final point, Forbidden Planet is pure science fiction at it's best for the era, and it still hold up today, this is science fiction as it was meant to be, this film set standards for future films to follow. Today's science fiction is dead-film wise, there is no imagination left-ok-ok, what about Star Wars? What about it? Its in a different league of science fiction and it and it successors are really merchandize driven, (today's generation are of a different mind-set) as with all other sci-fi/fantasy films.<br /><br />Thanks to [...] for additional information on the cast.ll no, because there's no such thing, I mean if we are featuring Robby as a bonus in what he has done over the years, then two more acting skills should have been included in this 50th Anniversary Edition: 1] the Lost in Space episode, \\"The War of the Robots\\" and 2] the Ark II episode, \\"The Robot\\", (this episode showed Robby with a different look than what we are used too) and there are more, of course like than appearance in Wonder Woman for example.

1595141979|5.0|Another EXCELLENT book in the series! I'm so glad that now we have grasp on what \\"shadowkiss\\" really means...    I am just going to do this as a quick rant without really giving out anything major but something that will get those who are not convinced that this should be a tbr priority.     Complications are piling up. Rose seems to be getting a lot of it. This series contains angst beyond ordinary teenager (in fiction). Mason came back, only not as what we all hoped for. The Guradian field experience is up and there was an unexpected pairing. Lissa can use her powers again only there are consequences and our bada$$ best guardian in the making plays a role that is so huge it questions the Dhampir to Moroi code of conduct or motto or whatever you wanted to call it. Victor was ushered away, for now. The Queen is a total b!tch and has a long term goal that got me mad ( I know it's only a book and I should calm down, but no. I am passionate and this is what I feel). We also still have Adrian and I think he's going to stay, I actually like his role but I am still suspicious. Christian's insecurity about that his family reputation and Adrian-Lissa training with their magic is getting the best out of him. The moment that I was waiting for finally happened, what now?! how will this change them? I am so EXCITED!!! I think most of the fans that read that part actually jumped up and down, coz I did and some people I know did too. Only they aren't at lunch sitting inside their office with an open door when they did that. (uh-huh I embaraased myself again). Finally an unexpected, never been imagined, never benn questioned and action pack \\"awesomeness\\" happened and a part that screams \\"this is an outrage! really is this happening?\\" How? What? I am not telling, you have to read it NOW people, you don't know what you're missing.

He is a great character and I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys adventure, love stories, and good tale of demons, vampires, magic and werewolves.
B001SN78JO|5.0|Yes Man is a hilarious comedy with a positive message surrounding it.Jim Carrey stars as Carl,a banker who turns his life around after going to a YES Seminar.    In this seminar he must say Yes to every option that he is presented and this gets him in some really crazy situations like flying lessons,driving a homeless man to a park at night and a Persian wife finder site.His Manager Norm (Rhys Darby) is very funny and fun to watch as is Jim himself and Zooey Deschanel as the spontaneous girl who he falls in love with.A Good Hearted Comedy i recommend if you like Classic Jim like Liar Liar.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|You can't beat the price. 2 cd's and a full length dvd for $13.99.    Out of 34 songs there are about 12 to 14 songs that we hear on every tour. That's fine because there are at least 20 songs that are not part of what we see and hear every time he tours. For those tired of the same old songs then stay home. We pay anywhere from $50 to $300 for a ticket and it's not asking too much for Paul to devote 1/3 of his show to covering his best known songs. It's only fair that he gives us that, and he does. On this dvd/cd set there are about a dozen songs he plays on every tour. The other 20+ songs either have never been done live before or haven't been done so in a long time. Omit those songs that are the most well known songs in his career than you will really see the fans revolt. Every tour he does he keeps fresh by giving us 2/3 of the material as songs not often heard.    Now for my remarks on this product: This is my favorite live set so far because it translates so well onto the television and Paul's voice is unbelievable. He sounds better now than he did 20 years ago. If you have a flat screen and a home theater make some popcorn and sit right down because your in for a great show. To some extent I get tired of the usual 12 live songs that always appear on his tour releases but I'm still glad they're all included. What I've done is create my own cd with a little over 70 minutes of music leaving off some of the usual songs. See? Problem solved.
0385737947|5.0|J. K. Rowling meets Michael Grant meets William Golding meets Suzanne Collins in this thrilling new series starter that is destined to rock the bestselling charts and find its way into many people's hands. To put it even more straightforwardly, THE MAZE RUNNER is brilliant, exciting, and utterly unputdownable. My heart is still pounding even days after reading it!<br /><br />The two most impressive things that Dashner achieves in THE MAZE RUNNER are suspense and the suspension of disbelief. The Glade is a truly creepy world, with half-animal half-machine killers roaming the Maze after night, new arbitrary \\"Variables\\" changing the stakes and odds of survival for the kids, and ever more crazy things thrown into the story that, at the hands of a less skilled author, would make readers incredulous. But what Dashner accomplishes is the total separation of the Glade from reality, so that when he does throw a whole bunch of random crazy scary things in, you won't even blink an eye, except from terror. You won't question the arbitrary rules in this new world, because you won't have to, and you'll be too busy biting your nails and flipping the pages to worry!<br /><br />A story cannot stand on its plot and suspense alone, but THE MAZE RUNNER also has well-developed characters as well. At first, Thomas may seem a little irritating, so frightened and questioning of authority is he. However, when he begins to take control of his emotions and emerges into a confident potential leader, we are firmly on his side and cheer him on in our own ineffectual little ways, outside of the story. Similarly, the other teenagers in the Glade become people who, even if you don't necessarily like, you can still identify and empathize with. The depth and breadth of characters makes THE MAZE RUNNER not simply a plot-driven novel, but a book that can compete with other suspenseful and complex bestsellers.<br /><br />Overall, THE MAZE RUNNER is a novel you shouldn't miss. It won't appeal to everyone--some might find the premise too staged, while others may complain of unsympathetic characters--but few can deny the palpable excitement that runs through these pages. Pick this book up and see for yourself which camp you fall in: either way, I don't think it will be a waste of your time.emise too staged, while others may complain of unsympathetic characters--but few can deny the palpable excitement that runs through these pages.

B002GZQYMK|5.0|bravo- muse has done it again! combining the sounds of early radiohead with the classic sound of queen, and their own ecclectic sound for the modern rocker, muse never fails to impress. like most other albums, you need to listen to the whole album several times to fully appreciate the genius in the music. at first a few tracks stand out (tracks 3,4,6 & 8)- classic muse, but you learn to love rest when you listen a few times! i am a big muse fan, and i rate this album among their best- a definite \\"keeper\\" for the modern rock music lover...

0385504225|1.0|What an awful, predictable, stupid book.  While,some authors, like wine, grow better with age, Dan Brown withers on the vine.  This is just a regurgitation of the DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons.  Same old formulaic tripe.  Dan Brown should take a page from the movie \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" and take a risk.  Each of these books has a great build up and then its sinks into disappointment.  I also can't stand his preachiness on what he believes God is.  Please spare me.
B002DKGWSE|4.0|Haven't watched the DVD yet, I hope it is in good condition. The delivery time was great. Thank you.
0385504225|1.0|After reading the DaVince Code several years ago and could not wait for Dan Brown's next novel.  The Lost Symbol is not nearly as good a novel as Davince Code was.  First of all it is very predictable and secondly the basic concept or idea is terribly uninspired.  The compelling ideas that were presented in the Davince Code are no where to be found in this novel.<br /><br />I suggest readers look elsewhere for something well written and inspiring to read and I also suggest that Dan Brown consider going back to stealing other people's ideas for his novels rather than try to come up with some on his own.  A good place for him to start perhaps would be with a story about the Large Hadron Collider.  He could steel Dr. Nielsen and Dr. Ninomiya's paper about the God Particle coming into the present from the future and damaging the collider to keep itself forever hidden.  Just an idea...
0882709194|5.0|I have researched Darwin in the past and find him not to be a bad man, just off the mark. I appreciate his keen interest in even searching. Most won't bother. I also sympathize with his human qualities of grief and suffering that we can all relate to and thus can lead to questioning, doubt and even anger. Where we go from there is vitally important. Perhaps many will acquire HOPE from this information and find that there IS a way back to greater faith and even joy. I love how God does not ask us to check our brains at the door, because we are all responsible to search for the truth if we really care about ourselves and those we love.
1416594787|4.0|Given the plethora of evolution books published recently, I argue it's imperative to consider this book's worthiness against these other recent publications.<br /><br />Richard Dawkins' objective with TGSOE is to present his \\". . . personal summary of the evidence that the `theory' of evolution is actually a fact - as incontrovertible a fact as any in science.\\" [1st pg. of the Preface].  This appears to make this book an argument for evolution, especially considering the subtitle, \\"The Evidence for Evolution\\". This framing also matches exactly to the explicit motivation expressed by evolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne in his book, [[ASIN:0143116649 Why Evolution Is True]].<br /><br />Having read both I'd recommend Coyne's book if one is looking for an optimal argument on why Science considers evolution a fact and why there are no remaining hypotheses able to challenge evolution as an explanatory model for the evidence or discredit the findings supportive of evolution.  It's much more concise, sticks more closely to peer-accepted findings, is more transparent about hedging on explanations where confidence is not yet overwhelming, and presents its findings in a manner easier to understand to someone not well educated in biology.<br /><br />However, given that I think even the Coyne book falls short on its argument I also recommend molecular biologist Daniel Fairbanks' [[ASIN:1591025648 Relics of Eden: The Powerful Evidence of Evolution in Human DNA]] to provide additional evidence contained within all of life's DNA that evolution is both true and convincingly falsifies all prior arguments made by creationists and intelligent design creationists.  Coyne makes an arguable assertion on why he didn't include a specific chapter on the evidence in our DNA though he weaves it into other chapters; I think that missing chapter is why Coyne's book is not a masterpiece.  I'll post the link to his argument in the comments section of this review.<br /><br />What I like about TGSOE and why I still recommend purchasing it is Dawkins' skill as a teacher.  I quickly left by the wayside that this book was an argument and instead treated it as a tutorial.  What I especially liked about Dawkins' book which makes for a poor argument but a great tutorial is his use of analogies and thinking exercises.  Dawkins provides examples not merely because they provide devastating arguments for evolution, but instead because they are teachable moments.  His reporting on the guppy and the Lenski experiments were as effective as any of Coyne's examples as arguments.  However, Dawkins' distinguishes himself in providing examples that allow the stories and principles to resonate well after having read them. He asks questions, and guides us to how the evidence answers those questions.  This makes for a lengthier book than Coyne's, but also helps reinforce the topical matter.  The numerous photographs in the book also helped reinforce his examples and were an unexpected surprise.<br /><br />An example of a powerful teaching moment was that Dawkins starts with how hominids acted as an agent to evolve wolves into an astonishingly broad collection of domestic dog breeds in the blink of evolutionary time.  At first I thought this was too simplistic; I was wrong.  Dawkins' builds on that reportage by then showing how plants and animals' dependent on those plants each act as agents causing the other to evolve.  This eases the beginner (which I'm not though I'm also not an expert) into better appreciating how natural selection works.  This initial primer on natural selection is not where it ends, instead Dawkins' excels at teaching natural selection from several aspects in a manner that optimizes retention of the principles discovered and the evidence falsifies other proposed mechanisms.  Given the fact this makes for a bigger book than Coyne's, Dawkins' book is superior at taking on topics at a more advanced level.  Dawkins begins at an even more elementary level than Coyne does, but then uses chapter after chapter to build upon what was learned in the previous chapter to flesh-out our understanding of evolutionary topics, particularly natural selection, how the variation in our DNA provides a map to our ancestral heritage, and how an intelligent designer is a ludicrous notion once we've understand all the evidence collected to date which not only validates evolution but frequently falsifies the idea of a designer - where the score is an uncountable number of observations for Science to zero for design advocates (which is a primary reason they don't publish in relevant peer-reviewed journals).<br /><br />Where Dawkins' book suffers is related to his own personal musings.  As a tutorial these musings are often but not always instructive.  Science is significantly about what to research next given we certainly don't know everything.  Dawkins' allows us a peek into where the research is heading.  In fact, if you enjoy the chapter about evolutionary development, than I highly recommend adding to your knowledge in  this area given it too provides overwhelming evidence for evolution while falsifying creationist/IDC notions, the classic is still biologist Sean B. Carroll's [[ASIN:0393327795 Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science of Evo Devo]].  In addition, scientists as creative thinkers are often thought of as contradictory attributes when in fact it's a necessary element of framing your hypotheses or trying to create reasons to explain surprising data discoveries and then go off and attempt to validate these new notions.  Science as a process actually yields more creativity than nearly all other thinking disciplines and Dawkins infers such in many of his musings.<br /><br />One weakness I found is that Dawkins speculates in areas where the science is already being conducted, e.g., group selection, and the math regarding the number of planets where life could exist.  So why waste pages speculating with zero data when he could have instead reported where the efforts were to date and extrapolated from there?  In addition Mr. Dawkins can be a somewhat sloppy writer if this were treated like an argument rather than a teacher teaching; opening up opportunities for creationists to dishonestly quote-mine him where he is a preferred target of theirs, e.g., \\"the fact of our own existence is almost too surprising to bear\\" on pg. 425 and his other extraordinary reflections not shared by many of his peers.<br /><br />Such rhetoric is sloppy because creationists often disingenuously attribute something one scientist states as personal opinion as that believed by all scientists.  In a perfect world such intellectual dishonesty wouldn't occur and we wouldn't have to worry about how a great teacher's occasionally sloppy rhetoric is twisted to argue the opposite of what both the teacher and his discipline's adherents understand.  So if you are a creationist looking to test your faith against what Science understands, the Coyne and Fairbanks' books are far sterner tests and provide less opportunities to avoid confronting the evidence that destroys that faith or at least requires modification if one is honest with oneself.  If you want to actually learn and optimize the quality of the teaching where you forgive Dr. Dawkins occasionally lapsing into tangential topics, this book will resonate long after you've finished it and serve as a handy reference guide after your initial read.<br /><br />I gave the book four rather than five stars primarily because I think he needs to use more research assistants to better footnote his book to more of the evidence he's reporting.  While I've encountered nearly all his examples prior to my reading his book and know he's accurate in his reporting (with the exception of his possibly extending the findings in the Lenski experiment), books on controversial subjects should go over-board in citations. He also should have provided more examples from other scientists than his own musings, coupled to his musings not adding much, e.g., I found his zeal for computer programs extraneous to a book serving as a general review of the state of evolution.  This adds up to the fact he needs a sterner editor. Given his success in selling prior books, it's not a surprise he was given so much latitude - to a fault I think.<br /><br />If after the purchase of this book you remain excited about the topic and want to learn more, I recommend at least considering (I haven't read it yet but it's in my queue) getting Carl Zimmer's new book, [[ASIN:0981519474 The Tangled Bank: An Introduction to Evolution]].  Mr. Zimmer is one of our most trusted and respected science writers and is a brilliant communicator of evolution both in his prior books, periodical articles, and his blog.  Tangled Bank is a text book focusing strictly on teaching evolution.extrapolated from there?

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I watched this because my date wanted to watch it.  This movie is extremely funny and entertaining.  I highly recommend it.  The only downside that there are many things Kids won't understand, hence \\"PG\\" rating.
B002NWRMVS|3.0|I am a Norah Jones fan since her first and wonderful album \\"Come away with Me\\". This was a say, 10/10 album. Then came out \\"Feels like home\\", a 9/10 album, good but not perfect. Two years ago she gave us \\"Not Too Late\\", say 7/10. Now we have this \\"The Fall\\" and as you can guess from the album title, the rate is \\"falling\\" and I think this is a 6/10 album.<br /><br />The first albums were full of memorable and captivating songs. This one is full of boring songs. \\"Chasing pirates\\" , \\"Tell yer Mama\\" or \\"Man of the hour\\" are lights but I find many of the other songs are just shadows.
B002QH2NUA|4.0|Last July, I obtained, at the last minute, a ticket to see Paul McCartney play at Fenway Park, Boston.  Boy, was I pleased I went!  The show was incredible!  No other musician has the kind of musical catalogue that Sir Paul can draw upon.  It was just amazing to hear 35,000+ people sing, a capella, the coda to \\"Hey Jude\\".  You can hear that, as well as the rest of the show (to the best of my recollection, the playlist for the Fenway show was the same as the one on these CDs, and was likely the same, or virtually the same, for all the shows on Paul's summer 2009 tour) on this 2 CD/DVD set issued on a certain coffee chain's \\"Hear Music\\" label.       This CD/DVD combo is a great momento of the show for anyone who went, and for those who didn't, is a nice collection of great Beatles/McCartney/Wings songs played live.  The majority of the songs included on this set (and all but one song on the second CD) are in fact Beatles songs, played live by the only remaining Beatle who can play them (sorry, Ringo).  While most of the songs are principally Paul's, he does pay tribute to George (\\"Something\\"; with Paul on mandolin or ukelele) and John (\\"A Day In The Life\\" > \\"Give Peace A Chance\\").       I have listened to the CDs, mostly in the car, and partly on my home system.  My first impression is that the performances are very, very good, and the sound is decent enough for a live show.  Amazingly, after all these years, Paul's voice still sounds the same!  In addition to his fine voice, Paul displays his musical talents by playing, in addition to his famous Hofner electric bass, electric guitar, acoustic guitar, keyboards and mandolin (or ukelele).  New York resident Billy Joel makes a cameo appearance on \\"I Saw Her Standing There.\\"  While these are not definitive performances (for those, check out the remastered Beatles CDs), they offer a great listening experience.  I have not yet watched the DVD.        Contrary to the cover information, the CDs are apparantly a representation of Paul's summer 2009 concert show culled from three different shows performed at New York's Citi Field, which has replaced Shea Stadium (the site of the famous 1964 Beatles concert(s)), and which is now the new home of the New York Mets baseball team.  The songs are blended together to give the illusion that they are from a single concert.  Having gone to the Fenway show, I can report that Paul's in between song banter has been eliminated from the CDs; I can't yet report on the DVD.         The packaging leaves something to be desired.  The CDs and DVD are housed in cardboard sleeves, so care is required when removing and replacing the CDs.  There is no identification of the actual dates of the performances.  Nevertheless, this set is a great value, 2 CDS and a DVD for the price of a single CD.  For those who went to one of the shows, this is really a must buy, as it is a great momento of a memorable concert.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|When it comes to the Bat Out of Hell series, they are a little different.  By different, I mean they are not what most people would consider really mainstream.  Whether because of, or despite, the lack of Steinman, this is still a great BooH entry.  It is so different from the other two yet has that epic and operatic feel one expects from this series of albums.  You can tell from note one it is a bat album, but you listen to it and marvel at how much different it sounds and still keeps the feel of the others.  It is a bit harder than the others (well, the other two had their spots) overall, but it works for me.  I am, however, more into the hard rock style of music so maybe it just sits better with me.  It keeps me wishing the album won't ever end.
B002HWRZH0|5.0|I just received my Spececial Edition set.  The quality of the statue was very good.  No plactic here, metal had no flashing and was well polished.  It shows someone cared when they made it.  Not a big Trekkie, but found this well worth the investment.  Makes a fine display.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|Wow. What a let down. I don't think the person who wrote this ever saw any Star Trek show. I'm a soft core trekkie and even I know that this is a bunch of bunk. And trying to explain its indescretions with 'it's an alternate reality' just doesn't fly. Even an alternate reality would not have all the stupied goofs this movie does. It will not grace my Trek shelf, in fact, if I can sell it, I will. I am not going to go into the ideosyncracies this movie blows, it would take me all year. Just know...if you're any kind of Star Trek fan, this one will make you cry. And not in a good way. Gene must be turning over in his grave. This does not deserve the name Star Trek. It is some little boy's fantasy of being Kirk and being a hero and getting all the girls. Keep your fantasy to yourself and give us proper movies people. I am so disappointed. Seeing the commercials for it made me reticent, but my 20 something son said it was better than the ads. I told him I will never respect his opinion again. Of course, he grew up with the Next Generation and never saw the original...neither did the writer of this movie. It took me 6 years before I could watch TNG, but after that I got right into Voyager and DS (until it became a soap opera), but I am back to square one and will never buy anything Trek until I have seen it, not even a movie ticket. Trek has lost its respectability. *sob*
0143117009|5.0|What the author concludes is simple: the people who have disappeared is because the people have done with their resources and peoples that have survived have done so because they have managed their resources well, in general, natural resources. That's it. In more than 700 pages in the volume, as described above are examples of what statement. The disappearance of the inhabitants of Easter Island, the Anasazi, the Mayans, the Vikings in Greenland, Rwanda, Haiti and others. Diamond seems to say \\"Take care of resources or we will do the same.\\" No one talks about Third World societies or societies in the past but begins his book by citing the example of the devastation mining in Montana and pollution in the city of Los Angeles.<br /><br />The examples used are vividly narrated and explained in detail, with plenty of scientific backing certainly do see that everything is as it says poses. It should be read.
0810983915|5.0|I had sort of sadly given up on my son (11y.) ever wanting to read anything - unless he was made to.  Reading gave me a lot of comfort and pleasure and I devoured a few series when I was his age.  Just as I had come to terms with the fact that he is different and that I shouldn't be imposing what I enjoy, Diary of a Wimpy Kid entered the house.  I couldn't believe it:  He was reading night after night with the flash light on in bed.  I thought the day would never come.  So Jeff;  Thank you.  Thank you!!
159562015X|1.0|I received this book from a colleague, who really wanted me to take the online test. So I entered the code from the book and answered the 180 or so questions, only to find the results to be rather useless.    The questions are of the \\"strongly agree-disagree\\" type, which is fine as long as you have a real choice. But frequently the opposites were no true opposites at all; a lot of them were rewordings of the same answer, defeating their purpose.    After filling in the questionnaire I received a top-5 of my strengths, which lean heavily on the \\"Barnum-effect\\", i.e. most people with vastly differing backgrounds will still be able to recognize themselves in the statements. This is heightened by the extremely optimistic wording; who wouldn't like to be told they are smart, critical, hard-working or creative? In that it highly resembles other personality-assessment methods, such as Myers-Briggs or Enneagrams, which are similarly vague and unhelpful.    I read some of the other descriptions in the book and found that a lot of them fit me even better than the five assigned to me. I especially wonder why  \\"analytical\\" is not in my top-5, since I am well-known for my tendency to debunk arguments, always trying to find the truth behind statements--much as I am doing right now.     The worst part, of course, is that you have to cough up $550 to get the results of the other 29 strengths, which labels this whole operation as a scheme to lift your purse.     In short: don't waste your time and money.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Crazy in Love with this CD.  First Michael Buble music and I am hooked!  Great instruments & vocals.  Job well done and worth the price.
B002DKF47O|5.0|I've listened to this band for years but I've never loved one of their records enough to go purchase and add to my collection, but this one was the one. Not only is it their best album, but alongside the 2009 releases from Nile, Suffocation, and Hypocrisy the best of the year in extreme music. I'm stoked that Colin Richardson mixed this. I was skeptical at first, but he gave them a solid sound. The music is damn near perfect.
0061914177|5.0|I read this book after having watched appoximately 700 or so episodes of Gary Vaynerchuk's video blog on [...].  In every written word I can hear Gary's passionate voice I know so well from his blog.  The book is motivational and instructional and shows how caring, hard work and passion can net you a fulfilling life in every way, not just monetarily.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend to anyone, not just people interested in wine or marketing a brand.
0385504225|4.0|This book is a real page turner - Dan Brown writes an exciting novel that takes you on a wild ride thru our nations capital - Great read
B0029O08WA|4.0|No, this is not the Twilight soundtrack which was fantastic, but this album completely compliments the mood of the New Moon plot.  The New Moon installment of the Twilight Saga is not an upbeat and happy story.  It is not as action packed as the first installment either.  It would be completely inappropriate if this album was anything like the first.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I am asking myself...\\"I thought I ordered a new product?\\"  On the first play, several of the DVD's skipped or had static across the screen.  I still need to contact the distributor and hope for the best.  I have ordered many DVDs from Amazon, this is the first time I have been disappointed.
0385504225|4.0|I have never really enjoyed reading and always went for the cliff notes vs reading the book when I was in school.  I must say I have enjoyed reading Dan Brown's books and they have sparked an interest for me to start reading more.  I am not going to disect this book like some reivews do as I would not know where to start. I will say the book was entertaining, kept my interest and I really enjoyed it.
B001R10BMS|4.0|The James Bond movies constitute one of the greatest movie franchises in history.  This is the worst of the entire series.  This being said, it is still pretty good.  Sean Connery was at an all time low between his fit and smart-aleck youth and his suave, poised maturity.  The script was lifted from Thunderball.  The gimicks and gadgets weren't terribly creative.<br /><br />Still, it moves at a good pace, the jokes are OK, the villians are fairly sinister, Kim Basinger gives a passable performance, and if you're not comparing it to other Bond films, it is pretty good.<br /><br />Even at its worst, Bond is still better than most.<br /><br />E.

B001FBSMF8|1.0|Chris Cornell is undisputably one of the best male voices in Rock of all time. Unfortunately even he can not save the sterile, crappy, plastic, genre that is Pop.  Cornell proves that he is versatile enough to sing within this genre and fit in, however it is not a place where he can truly shine; The music, rather, diminishes him. There is no substitute for the warmth of acoustic drums, electric bass and guitars, acoustic guitars, and other instruments played by HUMAN BEINGS. Loops, programs, and cliche pop mixing techniques are a lame match in the wind compared to the bonfire that Cornell is capable of, whether solo, with Sound Garden, or Audio-Slave. Chris, I appreciate your statement. You have now been there and done that. Please return home. :) We miss you.
B001P06GX4|5.0|I purchased this game several years ago and it remains one of my favorites.  It can be easily played with 2 or 4 players, or 3 if you are creative enough.  When I explain the concept to my friends, I tell them, \\"Imagine Tetris and Chess at the same time!\\"<br /><br />Blokus is a great spatial-reasoning exercise, and quickly became one of my wife's (an interior designer) favorites.<br /><br />This game starts with players dividing up the colored pieces into four piles - one for each player.  We keep ours seperated in 4 baggies to make this step a lot easier.  The first player places their first piece so the corner square of the playing area nearest them is filled, then the other players do the same in turn.  From that point, it's a free-for-all.  The only rule is that every following piece must touch a corner, and only a corner (not a side), of an existing piece of the same color but not overlap any square already filled by another piece.  Once a player is not able to play anymore pieces, they are eliminated.<br /><br />My strategy is to go towards the center with as many long pieces as possible, then start filling in towards one of the sides.  There is a scoring system in place, but I usually play until only one person is remaining and call them the winner.
B00005JPNY|4.0|Before I start this review, I would like to comment on the \\"religious\\" factors of this film. I am a Catholic and loved this! There was nothing atheist about it. The way I viewed the Magisterium was a Communist government. Even if it was a jab at the church, it was probably referencing back to old times when the people of the church did want to control everything (Uber-Christians should really learn their history). And, judging by how some people reacted to these \\"atheist\\" tones, they must be working for the Magisterium, trying to say what's best for others when they should just mind their own business and let people decide for themselves.<br /><br />Now to the movie. Dakota Blue Richards is a very good actress and one of the very few child actors who aren't annoying. She seems undaunted for her first film and I really hope they film the next two installments as I would like to see her improve and hone her talent. Daniel Craig, Eva Green (reuniting from Casino Royale but have no scenes together), Sam Elliot and Nicole Kidman (can't believe I'm saying something good about her) are all excellent in their supporting roles. Though I will admit that Craig floats in and out of the picture like that Prudence character from Across the Universe (though not as much as her, at least Craig's character is important to the plot) and Kidman's revelation that she is Richards' mother seems a little out of left field though Mrs. Coulter could be lying. Christopher Lee has very good billing in the end credits for having one line of dialog in a very small scene. I wish the explanation of dust had gone into a little more detail instead of the Magesterium just talking about it like its a drug or whatever. Action scenes are spectacular, especially the final battle in the north. Music is also very good and, if they ever film the next two, I certainly hope they use the same composer. A fine film that I hope to be the next successful book-to-film translation like Lord of the Rings/Harry Potter/James Bond.Bond.
B002OEBMN4|4.0|Slayer is back with yet another strong album's worth of speed, blood, and more blood!  In my opinion, their strongest album since \\"Diabolus in Musica\\".  Favorite trax are \\"Beauty Through Order\\" & \\"Hate Worldwide\\" & \\"Human Strain\\".  Lyrics are intense throughout the album, including comments on the planets' oil controversies on \\"Americon\\".<br /><br />The bonus DVD (Limited Edition only) includes a 20 minute graphic video \\"Playing with Dolls\\", written and directed by Mark Brooks.  Story of a young boy who discovers his mother killed and in her own pool of blood.  He grows up with deep personal issues, I mean deep, and reconciles himself by trying to bring his mother back, by using the various body parts of the women he has killed.  Blood, Blood and more Blood.<br /><br />Be warned, it is quite intense and a little disturbing.  Seeing a nun get whacked across the head with a huge cross, hmmm.  If you're a big Slayer fan, than this is something you'd probably like to have and should have as the packaging and double digipack is quite impressive.  Otherwise, the DVD is not something you would watch more than once.<br /><br />Overall 8/10
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I've seen the movie, in theatres, about four times and was looking forward to seeing it again!  When I learned when the DVD was going to be available, I could hardly wait to get my hands on it!  NOW IT'S FINALLY HERE!!!!    With the two-disc set, I've gotten the opportunity to finally see the deleted scenes that I have read so much about!  I wish that they had found a way to include these scenes on the DVD version of the movie, even if it made the movie longer.    The \\"Blooper reel\\" is also FUN to watch along with the background tech on this particular TREK!!!!  I often wondered how they managed to do all of the special effects!  The techniques were simpler than I imagined!  It also looks like both the cast and crew had a LOT of fun making this movie, including the cast of children!!!!    I can't wait to play it again!!!!!!!
0793518326|4.0|First and foremost, I would like to point out that this book is a collection of transcriptions based on people listening to the records, not official Beatles scores.  That being said, it makes no guarantees of accuracy, nor should it.  I have played through a good deal of it and found it to be at the very least accurate to a high degree.  There were several obvious times where the scores had incorrectly lyrics, but I figure if I could spot them then it's no big deal.  As far as the guitar and piano parts, I can't say too much on their accuracy, because I can't play those two instruments well enough to offer a fair opinion.  The bass parts, however, are very accurate, though at times confusing, especially with various \\"da capos\\" and things.  As for the size of the print itself, I don't really have an issue, though a more traditional font might have helped with reading the numbers on the tablature.  Ones look like nines.  Once the problem is spotted, though, it becomes clear in the future.  That's how most transcriptions are.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in a rough playing guide to the Beatles,  especially since it's better than starting from scratch, errors and all.

B002T9H2LA|4.0|Quentin tarantino continues with his eclectic style of directing in this film. A all star cast as usual that coincides with each other. Each having there own tale that in a bigger picture all coincides with one another. I felt at times the film could have used more detail but all and all a great film. Also the majority of the film is either in french or German so if your not a big fan of reading subtitles then this may not be for you. Equipped with some humor and some strong acting chops the film delivers the suspense.

B002S0OBFK|1.0|I'm not some reviewer who likes to bash a bad movie like others do. I have seen it with my wife. It scared the piss out of her, but for me I was just bored and not really not drawned into it. I watch ghost hunters and various shows, but the movie was basically easy to read on what is going to happen next. Again, I'm not saying this is the worst movie of the year or what not. I'm a huge fan of the horror genre. For some reason, I did not like the movie.
0061766089|5.0|I'll preface this review by saying that I am not in the business world, or anything related to it.  I'm a psychologist, who spent upwards of 20 years studying creativity (from an academic/ cognitive science perspective).  I have also belonged to an internet mail list dealing with the subject for upwards of 20 years; a list comprised of people from all different disciplines.  I have read a great deal on the subject both as part of my academic research and whatever seemed like it would add to/ enhance my understanding of the area.  As a consequence, I have read quite a few books on \\"applied creativity,\\" many directed at the business world.  All that said, I am a pretty critical reader in this subject area, but this book left me floored, literally speechless.  I can not remember the last time I have marked so many pages in a book!<br /><br />  I first picked it up a few weeks ago, and had to reread it, get some distance in order to be able to write a coherent review.  The book is very well written.  It begins by leading the reader through Tim Brown's personal journey with design and innovation, and goes on to explore the differences between design, innovation and design thinking.  In the process he provides on of the most insightful descriptions of the creative process which I have encountered yet.  In fact, were I to try to recommend another book on the topic (and I have read hundreds of books, journal articles, monographs) I would have to reach back 30+ year to books which are likely no longer in print and which could only be found in a good university library.<br /><br />  When i came here to write a review on this book, I was frankly surprised to see that there were so many others, but that is because I am, as noted earlier, outside this area.  He seems to have a substantial following, and deservedly so.<br /><br />  To get to the content of the book; while it is not a step by step \\"how-to,\\"  Tim Brown gives an overview of design thinking and argues effectively for taking a different approach to product design.  Because of my background I would use slightly different terms than he does, and say that he is coming in at a different level of the process; what Koestler would refer to as paradigmatic, and what has become commonly known (at the product level) as game-changing.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I have read the 1 star and 2 star reviews. Save your time and just ignore them. The movie is sweet and enjoyful. The Blu-Ray has pristine sound and picture. There are some people who just complain about the price of the Blu-Ray edition. Its still currently for $[...]. You get the following.    1 - Blu Ray movie feature  1 - Bonus Features Disc  1 - DVD movie feature  1 - Digital Copy     Still worth $[...] bucks to me. It has geat demo material to show off your home theater.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|What a great deal! If they started packaging all Blu-Ray movies like this I'll buy more.  I've been renting, not buying because I don't want to buy a movie I can only play in my living room.  If my kids want to take a movie to Grandma's house or watch it in our back room or on our computer they can't if it's Blu-Ray.  With this great set that contains all three (Blu-Ray, DVD, and Digital copy all for one $19.99) they've solved all my problems.  I actually came home and re-checked what I paid on Amazon because they are selling this in town for $35 and more!    The movie itself is another wonderful hit from Pixar.  There really is something for everyone.  The beginning is very touching and I found myself putting myself in his place as he and his wife went through their troubles.  My kids went to the movies to see this and loved it.  Like I said, a great movie and a great deal!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I have seen this movie when it first came out in theaters. My wife and I enjoyed it. Can't say I grew up watching the origianl tv shows, but grew up watching The Next Generation and such forth. If you read other reviews, they complain about they missed up this and that. Whatever. Star Trek was a dying breed. Enterpriese was failing on ratings. They had to re-vamp the Star Trek franchise. One reviewer mention minor dissapointments, I agree. But the movie was not a let down. As far as the Blu Ray version, I can't comment on the pic and sound since I'm still waiting on my copy.
B002O5M4SA|1.0|The \\"geniuses\\" who manage Sony Pictures have yet again demonstrated their utter contempt for American film watchers.  This time they excised 23 minutes of vital scenes from the movie while remastering it in Blu-ray format.    Either they think we are all \\"Bible-thumpers\\" incapable of handling fictional adult themes or they think we are so stupid that we will purchase first this heavily-censored version and then in six months be happy to purchase a second Blu-ray version containing the actual movie Luc Besson shot.    Boycott this version!  But definitely buy the 133 minute one when it is released in high definition.

0307454541|3.0|I had heard so much about this book that I couldn't wait to read it. I did think it was interesting, very different and did hold my interest.  However, I also thought it was hard going and a bit tedious at times to get through.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|I like John Mayer's new effort.  I like each track for a different reason. The first single is \\"Who Says\\".  This song is about John's life as a musician.  John's acoustic guitar playing is very soothing here.  My favorite track is \\"Perfectly Lonely\\".  The lyrics speak to me because I am happily single. \\"Crossroads\\" is a short song with excellent guitar riffs. \\"Assassin\\" has a cool drum beat. I like John's perspective on assassins.  It is a well written song.  The musical arrangements on this song are very good. I like the sound of \\"Friends Lovers Or Nothing\\". I like how John honestly puts people into these categories.  There is a lot of truth in this song.  \\"Half Of My Heart\\" is a song about how an individual's heart can be partially in a relationship.  Taylor sings for a few seconds on this song. She is not needed, but I still like this song.  \\"Do You Know Me\\" is the kind of song that puts my mind at ease after a hard day.  The simple guitar chords that John plays on this song are beautiful.  \\"Heartbreak Warfare\\" is a visual song about how relationships can be difficult.  \\"Edge of Desire\\" is a very subtle song.  This is a very romantic song that I love.  \\"War Of My Life\\" is a simple song about how life is a struggle.  The songs on this album are very personal, and I enjoy all of them.

0061348198|2.0|The Pact by Jodi Picolt was lent to me by a friend who absolutely loved it. I started reading it on a weekend, and have to admit that the story line was interesting. The characters grabbed my attention, but there was a certain redundancy in the narrative style. I like the plot to move on and have threilling inexpected turns. The autor tried to create suspense in her own style and used some psychological metaphor which was a good attempt. I was not happy with the climacx, I think it could have been handled with more finesse. Editing the book down to about 350 pages and especially making the ending more dynamic could have strengthened the storyline. I would recommend it but with a word of caution, I had to skim through several page.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I bought it as a gift. I believe it is a good set of DVDs. The only problem is that Amazon's web site could not send the item to the address in Canada that I entered. The U.S. Post office has no problem sending letters to that address, but not Amazon. I had to receive the product here in North Carolina and then send it to my relative in Canada. Not very efficient.

0882709194|1.0|I was given this book by a pack of (unbeknownst to me) fundamentalists who were distributing copies on my college campus.  I am truly appalled by this publication and its availablility on Amazon.  It is one thing to express an opinion, but quite another to package that opinion in false legitimacy.  (One has to laugh at the inarticulate product description, \\"Darwin's complete unabridged work of evolution,\\" despite the word [ABRIDGED] in the product title.)  This is a cheap and tacky shot at Darwinism, making Ray Comfort and the minions who distribute his work (Amazon included) look even worse than they already do.      My only comfort is the knowledge that NO ONE who truly understands evolutionary theory -- which, like \\"relativity theory,\\" is undisputably accepted, not a \\"theory\\" at all -- will take this book seriously.  As you can see from the ratings, split between 5 stars and 1 star, attempts like these serve only to increase the conviction of creationists and rile up those like myself, who actually study science rather than wear it like a ill-fitting garment.
0385504225|3.0|I've enjoyed all four of Brown's prior novels and while I enjoyed \\"The Lost Symbol,\\" it's definitely his weakest effort to date and a bit of a disappointment after the long wait.  The book moves along at a decent clip and is nearly always engaging.  Despite some unnecessarily complex syntax, Brown is an immensely readable author, and the book definitely had me pining for a trip to Washington.      One of my biggest problems with the book is that it lacks the grand scope, or at least the perpetual forward motion, of his earlier novels.  Without giving too much away, the plot here involves a single artifact uncovered early in the book that leads to very little payoff.  When taken as a whole, great sections of the book seem to be more about spinning wheels than moving toward the conclusion.  Brown also sets up characters, locations and objects as significant but barely follows through with their resolutions on several occasions.    That said, Landon is entertaining as always, and I like how Brown is such an academic that he thinks a professor would get \\"wild applause\\" after a lecture on freemasonry.  Unfortunately, as mentioned in some of the other reviews, Langdon doesn't do much in this book, and even Langdon himself says as much.  Because Katherine is an intellectual match, Langdon doesn't have to carry the investigation and basically does nothing in the last half of the book.     Despite these flaws, I would have rated the book at least 3.5 stars, maybe 4, as a fun read if not for the terrible rambling conclusion.  I'm not sure what Brown was thinking by dragging his book a full fifty pages past its climactic resolution (that's 10% of the book in case you're counting) but I nearly stopped reading.  The end of this is preachy and often eye-rolling and left me pining for the final page.  Luckily, the last few pages are significantly better than most of the conclusion.    All in all, \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is a passable effort from Brown but not as satisfying as his earlier work or other recent best-selling thrillers.  And I expect Brown can thank his last-act rambling for much of the ill-will toward this book.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is a very diverse CD, ranging from pop to urban to funk and R&B.  I think it's her best album ever, easily, including the not too bad new \\"Memoirs of An Angel\\".  Yes, Mariah's voice can be too breathy, but many times it has real strength on this cd.  What makes this album strong is the diversity of the music styles and arrangements.  It reaches out to a number of different audiences, without disenchanting any of them. She's not in the top 5 female vocalists in this century and never will be, but this is the mark she should target for the rest of her recording career.  Sing it hard, rich, strong and diverse, Mariah.    Paul
B00008G8M3|5.0|This was a great movie when I first saw it and now with what is going on in our country I think everyone should view it.  It shows America is willing to fight for the right to be free.  It is also humorous.  Will Smith and Jeff Goldbloom do a great job.

1439102813|5.0|This is one of the best depictions of a person with Alzheimer's I've ever read.  I felt as if the author knew, and was describing, my mother.  This novel is a tremendous outreach vehicle to bring more awareness to the general public in what Alzheimer's entails, which is so much more than simply \\"forgetfulness\\"!!  This is truly a riveting story which also illustrates the complex, harrowing disease known as Alzheimer's.  Congratulations to the author.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I've been a \\"Trek\\" fan since it's very first episode on NBC, over forty years ago, and I admit, I anticipated J.J. Abrams' reboot of the franchise with some trepidation. However, after viewing \\"Star Trek (Two-Disc Digital Copy Edition)\\", I admit that, other than a couple of quibbles, I enjoyed it immensely! I can appreciate the disappointment of some 'purists', as Abrams has made changes (some major) to the mythos, but for those who believe this destroys the past Trek canon, I remind you that the new film is set in an alternate reality, created by Nero's emergence from the manufactured black hole. The original Trek universe still exists, with Shatner and the 'classic' stories still intact. Nothing is lost; instead, a new realm is opened, offering a new generation of viewers (and we old-timers) the opportunity to be surprised and captivated all over again. Without a major overhaul, I'm afraid \\"Star Trek\\" would never have seen the light of day, again. Thank you, J.J. Abrams, for saving it!<br /><br />It was wonderful seeing Leonard Nimoy reprising 'Spock' one more time. As ancient as he has become, there is still magic when he is onscreen, and his scenes with young Kirk (Chris Pine), and Spock (Zachary Quinto), are wise, funny, and quite touching (when he says to Kirk, as an introduction, \\"I am, and always will be, your friend\\", I got the sniffles!). While I was afraid I wouldn't accept Pine in the Shatner role (he really looks nothing like him), he won me over, with the classic Kirk swagger, cockiness, and dead-on instincts. I could easily envision Shatner during the Kobayashi Maru exercise, as Pine smirked and chomped on an apple, while breaking the 'no-win' scenario. Quinto, despite a stronger resemblance to Nimoy, was actually a harder 'sell', as he has a relationship in the film that Nimoy's Spock would never have allowed himself, and displays more 'human' traits. His chemistry with Pine is so good, however, that I'm willing to let these quibbles ride, and see how things will develop in future. The rest of the Enterprise crew is excellent, with Zoe Saldana giving Uhura a strength that I wish Nichelle Nichols had been allowed to display back in the '60s. I especially enjoyed Karl Urban's grouchy 'take' on DeForest Kelley's 'Bones' McCoy (Dee would have loved it!), and Simon Pegg's dead-on portrayal of Scotty (could anyone else have been half as good?)<br /><br />Yes, some of the original Trek's ruminations about society's ills have been replaced by non-stop action, but I remember the pilot of the original Trek series, \\"The Cage\\", which NBC rejected as being too cerebral for viewers; they demanded a second pilot, with plenty of physical action...and the second pilot 'sold' the series. History, it appears, bears Abrams' decision out!<br /><br />Here is my other quibble...Kirk is commissioned from Academy Midshipman straight to Starship Captain? Starfleet would never jump anyone that fast, without some 'seasoning' in the lower ranks, and without service on smaller ships, before turning over the pride of the fleet to him...even if he DID save the Federation! Yeah, I understand why (you can't make a 'classic' Trek movie without Kirk commanding the Enterprise), but it feels wrong to me, nonetheless. Minor quibble, though!<br /><br />All in all, this is a fabulous adventure...it's great to have \\"Star Trek\\" back!will develop in future.

B000KITQK2|5.0|I have a Taylor GA4 with a Fishman Rare Earth Humbucker in the soundhole which has volume but no tone controls.  I was lacking bass response through the church PA (Mackie board).  I tried raising (shimming) the pickup on the bass string side, but it was way too sensitive to control without losing overall string balance. The sweepable midrange and treble and bass EQ on this unit allows me to more accurately translate that beautiful Taylor tone through the PA.  The XLR out is great too...solid and quiet.  I also have a 200 dollar Fishman Aura pedal with 16 very nice microphonic tone presets and it is great if your pickup has tone controls...I still use it for my Fishman Classic IV equipped guitar.  But this pedal is the most affordable DI with sweepable mid that you will find anywhere and it works.  Way to go Behringer!
0882709194|1.0|This version of On the Origin of Species has had several chapters removed. Apparently to keep the work from disagreeing with the long winded introduction of Young Earth Creationist Ray Comfort which is, I'm sorry to say, very poorly written and poorly reasoned. Do yourself a favor and get the original unabridged copy. This version, intended to be a conversion piece, is bound to be nothing more than a conversation piece.
0385504225|2.0|An absolute waste of time. I really liked the Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, but this book was about a 100 pages too long, with weak writing, and sub-standard story.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|This film is the roots of movie Sci-fi, The only way this DVD could be better is if they ever find the missing footage, (about 20 min's). the restoration on the dvd is more that anyone could hope for. This is probably as close to the original release as possible.
0375703764|3.0|This book was such a page turner. The amazing part of it was how the author used complete different writting styles to make it seems as though there were different authors with different directions in the book. There were 3 huge letdowns in the book.  1) The inclussions of fact and science wasn't nessicery. Although interesting, they barely related to the book.  2) I was waiting the whole book to see how the navidson story and Johny's story were gonna come together at the end. They didn't. I could of saved myself so much reading time by only reading navidsons story. Johny's story had very, i mean very, little to do with the story overall. He just told story after story of sexual encounters that had nothing to do with the story. His whole story, though well written was dry. If you are thinking of reading this book, i strongly advise only reading the navidson story if you wanna save alot of time  3) the biggest let down was the ending. All that story led up to a rushed and unthoughtfull ending. It was deffinity disapointing!  Overall, the book was almost amazing, if they left out the random extras, and had a creative ending.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|Michael Jackson's \\"THIS IS IT\\" cd was great. Everything they say about this cd is true. A most have cd.
B002N2XHXU|5.0|I have never read a book that was so interesting and had me hooked about war until now.    I read the book A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier by Ishmael Beah.  The title is one of the main reasons why I chose this book.  The memoirs of a boy soldier is exactly what this book is about, therefore fits this book well.  Ishmael Beah was nominated for Quill Award in the best Debut Author for 2007 and this book was one of the top 10 nonfiction books in 2007, but this was the only book he has written.  Ishmael Beah is a 12 year old boy about to experience a life he never would have imagined happening to him.  Him and some friends leave there native village to go to their talent show, not knowing they will never return.  While they are gone there home gets attacked by the RUF.  From this point on they all struggle to survive, by being captured, almost killed, and struggling to find their families.  The boys never find their families and Beah actually gets separated from his friends and brother.  Beah then run's into some boys he recognizes and goes about with them, barley surviving some trials that come along.  They then come to the town of Yele in the Bonthe District where they are surrounded by RUF fighters.  They are all forcibly conscripted by the army to fight; with the help of drugs, war movies, fellow soldiers, and combat violent this becomes fairly easy for them.  It is during this time that Beah becomes a mindless killer, definitely a different Beah from the beginning of the book.  He is then released from the army to the UNICEF a few years later in January of 1996.  Beah is taken to shelter in the capital of Sierra Leone, Freetown, and brought back to good health.  He and some other children cause trouble for the staffers.  Beah is also going through a tough time by experiencing drug withdrawal as well as troubling memories of his time as a solder.  At this rehabilitation shelter he meets a nurse, Esther, who becomes a huge part of his life.  He becomes very close with Esther and begins to visit her on a daily basis and even get presents from her.  I think this is a good thing for Ismael   at this part of his life because he has that person to talk to sense he does not have family and it makes him know that someone cares for him.  After being in the rehabilitation center for about 7 months he is then taken out by his aunt and uncle who become his new family.  From here he starts a new life with them and even gets to go to New York to speak to people about the lives of children in Sierra and what can be done about it.    This book was very interesting to me in ways I did not think it would be.  One thing I liked about this book is explained in much detail everything that happened to Beah and his friends and others.  I really like when books are in great detail and you can literally imagine what is going on and picture it in your head.  Even though when I was reading about some of the dead bodies and what was seen, it got me a little grossed out, I still liked the detail.  Also I really liked when they compared things, for example the moon.  The mom was saying \\"we need to strive to be like the moon.\\"  By first reading this sentence I did not understand what was meant.  But then reading on it explained it more.  It said everyone complains when it's too hot and too cold, but never when the moon shines, which is so true.  Everyone is always complaining about something during the day and the weather but never when the moon shines.  The book did appeal to me on an emotional level because it was very sad to read about what this young boy had to go through.  I always knew that kids had to go through wars and see it all happen, but never have read about someone's personal whole story.  It made me realize how truly lucky I am to be living the life I am, in the environment I am and having my family and friends always with me.   I could never imagine barley getting through a day because I do not get food or water if I don't find any, and have a good chance of getting killed at any minute.  Also it made me realize how important my family is to me.  This boy not only lost his family but had to go through one of the toughest situations without any of his family.  After reading this book it makes me appreciate my family a lot more because I am beyond lucky to have my family by my side through any little problem I may face.
143911000X|5.0|Got this as a gift.  Never had heard of the show and still haven't seen it, so if you don't have to be a fan to enjoy the book.  I found it hilarious.  Reminds me of a lot of guys I knew during school.  Whoever the writer was really has it down.    A fun novelty book.  Would make a good gift, I think.  I enjoyed mine.

0385737947|3.0|The Maze Runner by James Dashner<br />Tommy wakes up in a nuthouse, or that's what it seems. Shades of \\"Lords of the Flies\\" are alive and well. A no escape prison filled with teens and the mystery of how they got there is the plot of the story.<br />The story seems to revel in frustration and futility. Tommy vaguely recalls a previous life but can recall no details. The mystery is tantalizing and evasive. That was well done. The tension provides the appropriate mind set for a surprisingly captivating novel. I kept trying to dislike the story and couldn't put it down. It is book one of a trilogy that I will be forced to buy so I can find out what the heck is going on.<br />I recommend the book, it is not a warm and fuzzy read but it keeps your attention and makes you want to read the sequel.

B002HWRYJE|1.0|This is without a doubt the worst Star Trek installment ever.  The entire movie is a series of action vignettes pasted together with an extra weak story line.  I would have been really upset if I had actually paid to see this film in the theater. The film tries to be a cliche upon itself by having just about everything reflect sparkles and lights like a mirror.   The feel of this film is more \\"Star Wars\\" than Star Trek.  It clearly lifts much from Star Wars, from action scenes to the chaotic violent pace of the wanna-be story.      Okay fine.  It's okay for a film to look different or to be \\"just like Star Wars\\" (without a story).  However I would like Paramount to actually invest a bit of money in storylines.  This film has virtually no story.  This is a film born out of th editing room.  Not planned and with no particular story in mind.  It is a weak variant on the Boy travels through time... another boy meets his friend's dad... then boy fixes problem.  The Romulans are played as balding big-eared freaks.  Vulcans are sensitive, friendly aliens.  The theme of Kirk always winning and never suffering a serious defeat is upheld from the original series.  There is no question that the series creator, Gene Roddenberry would be very upset with this film.      Do not buy it.    Avoid this film at all cost.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|If you are a fan of the Disney Classics, you have to pick up Snow White on Blu-Ray/DVD Combo.  They film has been remastered and has never looked or sounded better.  We previously had Snow White on VHS and the difference between the two is astounding.<br /><br />In case you haven't seen Snow White, I have to tell you to beware as it is quite violent.  I watched it with my daughter and I was shocked at how much more violent it was than I remembered it.  The Wicked Witch orders the hunter to kill Snow White and cut out her heart.  There is also a seen in which the hunter is standing behind Snow White with a knife, in position to stab her.  So, this may not be the best movie to watch with your little one.  You might want to watch it first and fast forward through the scary parts when watching with a child.
B001L0ZMJM|5.0|The Fountainhead contains a simple, yet powerful message: innovation, originality, and determination will always triumph over trying to be the best in a conventional world. Because of this, I feel that this book has far more universal appeal than Rand's later work, mainly Atlas Shrugged, when she descended into extremist libertarianism. Though its been years since I've read this book, I still consider it a masterpiece, and a truly uplifting one at that.
B002HWRZH0|3.0|This is an ok collectible but I think its lacking some refinement. The item comes in a pretty low quality cardboard box. It could really use a nice see through plastic or glass case so it can be seen inside without opening it. The certificate doesn't individually number each piece. And the actual model is a little smaller than I thought it looked on amazon. Its a nice piece but I would think it should have had a lower retail price. It is nice to get the Blu-ray in its own package and not in some odd configuration like the Blu-ray Bat pod.
B002LK3DUQ|5.0|I have never reviewed a Pixar film on Amazon just yet, but their 10th feature `Up' had to be. Pixar, since Toy Story has spit out one hit after another bringing a whole new generation of legendary Disney Characters. While every single one of them has been incredible `Up' just stands out because it is unlike any of its Pixar predecessors.<br /><br />This is the second film from Pixar to be given a PG rating since The Incredibles. While The Incredibles was more based around comic books and superhero action the first few minutes of Up are very adult oriented. There are extremely real elements that lead us to the main characters adventure, but the previous one he had was real life. It is a beautiful sequence with no dialogue, but a score to show a husband and wife sharing the happy times and the devastating ones, one of them being the loss of a loved one. Even with no words it is so heartfelt and full of emotion it is just something that a young audience might not understand and the scene where Carl assaults a construction worker is also a moment that is very hard to explain to a very young person. After that the story changes gears to a rip roaring hysterical adventure. The cast works so well together especially bringing two legends in Edward Asner and Christopher Plumber. Everyone will love Russell, the eager young explorer who seeks adventure, but there is also more depth to this character that again reflects real live issues such as parent separation. Of course there is pure Disney magic in this film especially in the animals. This time when there are talking dogs, `Up' uses technology to make them speak instead of a traditional imaginative talking animal. That was a stroke of genius making is actually believable that someone can create a device to make an animal speak and still keep its own natural characteristics.<br /><br />Up may be the best Pixar film to date although I love each and every one of them, this just stands out as a story that was trying to get as real as it could.

B001GCUO1Q|3.0|OK, it was kind of dumb, and the writers should definitely be crucified until they can answer, and promise to rectify, all the story logic questions posed by other reviewers. But hey, the actors give it a game try, and it does have moments of geekness which partially counterbalance some of the flat-out X-men universe errors. Silverfox and Emma Frost sisters? Deadpool turned into a Weapon 11 and then being offed? How did Sabertooth become the slow galoot shown in X-1 and why do Wolverine's super-senses only work at the scripters' convenience? The Watchmen is the best example of a comic book adaption that didn't get too Hollywoodized. Hopefully someday we'll get an X-Men movie that doesn't prettify the characters beyond recognition to match available movie stars, rewrite the stories to suit the idiotic whims of so-called screenwriters and their puppeteers, and resist the temptation to abandon the human (or mutant) element and just have everything blow up all over the place in the end...

0061766089|4.0|So many things are not done design first.  In this book Tim Brown takes us into the mindset of a designer.    This book essentially delves into how to make design a part of the entire corporate life, giving companies ways to do things differently, explaining via case studies.  He also goes on to explain that design is just not essential for 'creative' companies, but for everyone.  It's supposed to make you think differently.  Essentially rethink everything from a design perspective.    While the book does give case studies and good overviews, the 'applied' part or rather the 'how to apply' this is somewhat lacking.  It does tell you to think differently, but doesn't give good steps how to exact this change throughout your company.      Overall it's a good read that even if it doesn't get you thinking different will give you a new perspective.
0385504225|2.0|I'm glad that I got the book from the library and didn't pay anything to read it. I suggest that others do the same.    While the plot is interesting and I ended up reading the entire book, I was itching to cover the pages with red pencil. It could have been half as long and been much better.    The Lost Symbol is ideal for something like a long flight, but doesn't measure up to Angels and Demons or The Da Vinci Code.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|This film is beautifully restored, and comes out great on the blu-ray.  The extras are a nice bonus.  I'm really glad that these classics are now being remastered and redone on blu-ray.  Even better you get the dvd in it as well, which works great for us because we only have on blu-ray player, so now we can play it all over the place, for the cost of essentially just the blu-ray.    Get this, your kids (and yourself) will get thrown back into the wonderful memories (well your memories) of your own childhood.  And if you're a big fan, you have many hours of extras to watch/listen to.
B001PO53IO|5.0|Show:  4/5  Video Quality:  5/5  Sound Quality:  4/5  Extras:  4/5  Overall:  4.25/5<br /><br />The Clone Wars must have inspired some kind of wonder ever since Mark Hamill mentioned it in a brief line in the first original movie. Even though it's briefly shown in the prequel films and a cool little cartoon made in 2003, there is still a lot to explore.<br /><br />Following the 2008 CGI Clone Wars movie, this show features the same funky blocky characters and semi-artistic rendering, but it seems to be of higher quality. Lighting effects, animation movements, lip movements, and action scenes overall seem much improved from the pilot film. More importantly, with multiple story lines to follow, the series offers better stories with deeper issues and stronger characters (characters ranging from the main heroes Anakin, Yoda, Obi-Wan, etc to the lesser known characters like Aayla Secura, Plo Koon, Kit Fisto, etc). The show has loads of great action scenes and high-quality effects. There are adventures on many different worlds (once again, some well-known like Naboo, Coruscant, etc to lesser-known ones like Iego), each offering imaginative design and impressive imagery. Production design (sets, props, costumes, vehicles, weapons, etc) matches the Star Wars universe and fits in perfectly; fans should be able to recognize a huge number of familiar elements, mixed in with cool new stuff. Music is not bad. All together, it's an awesome show that fits nicely in the franchise.<br /><br />This disc set features perfect PQ; I could not find any faults with it whatsoever. It's very sharp and clean, with excellent color and contrast. It is presented in an aspect ratio that is wider than the original broadcast version, providing more of the image to be seen.  Sound quality is acceptable (Dolby Digital 5.1), but as a lossy soundtrack, it's not as clean as it could have been, and lacks impact (despite the show's cool sound design). This set includes some cool extras (featurettes, a database feature, trailers, etc). It comes in a large, thick, rather nice digibook-type package with some cool production art inside.rs, etc).

B002AGIEYG|5.0|After listening to his first Brahms recording with the Berlin Phil, which won a Grammy award, I was hooked and wanted more. So it is an understatement for me to say how thrilled I am that Sir Simon Rattle and the Berlin Phil have recorded the complete Brahms symphonies. Brahms is truly at the center of the Berliner Phil's sound and style of playing. The performance on this recording is truly Brahmsian in its warmth, lyrical flow and structural coherence. Sir Simon Rattle's vision and iconoclastic approach to the Symphonies is truly a new milestone in the history of recordings of these works. This new recording is not only a valuable addition to any Sir Simon Rattle and Berlin Phil collector's catalogue but also to all classical music enthusiasts around the world.
B002K0WBXW|3.0|The story is cute but very predictable.  Sandra Bullock as the merciless boss forces engagement on her new subordinate to save her job.  Throw in a few quirky relatives and some Alaskan scenery, what choice does she have but to soften up and become human.  I think it could have used a few more twists and turns but if you're a Sandra Bullock fan, you'll love it anyway.  Ryan Reynolds... skip right to the places where he takes off his shirt.  Betty White is strangely eccentric but it works.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|...is the absolutely beautiful arrangement of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\".  I saw the show in Las Vegas and was immediately captivated by this new arrangement.  I'd always liked the \\"White Album\\" version, but this one just melted my heart.  When I listen to the CD, I always end up hitting the replay button at least once to listen to it again.  The harmonies in the strings are just breathtakingly beautiful.  Kudos to whoever is responsible for this new Beatles treasure.  The show itself is wonderful.  After it was over, I realized my cheeks ached a little because I just couldn't stop smiling!  Even my husband, who is rarely swept away by ANYTHING, used the word \\"fantastic\\" when we were talking about it.
B002MTTZ5I|5.0|This CD is the real deal. It rocks, it's makes fun of it's self. It is so funny, but most of all the songs are all really really good. Most likely your girlfriend or your wife will never get into this band and if they do, you have a keeper.         From what I see the band was going for a sound and a look for where metal should have gone in the late 80's and early 90's. At that time, bands started getting a little lame and the lyrics a bit tame. If this truly would have come out in say 1991 Nirvana and most of those other crap bands would have never saw the light of day. Fames of metal back then saw Bruce leave Iron Maiden, Vince leave Motley, Def Leppard was done when Steve Clark died and bands like Trixter and Firehouse just couldn't carry the torch. Had a band like Steel Panther arrived on the scene with an anthem like Death to All But Metal and in your face songs like Asian Hooker, it may have been a different story. Steel Panther is truly the next level. it's not too late, This record is for people who enjoy great 80's style hard rock and metal and have a sense of humor. No, the songs are not musically orignial, but that is not what they were going for.         Take it to the next level, buy this disc!
0545128285|5.0|I think I must have known this book had come out. I'm a big Harry Potter fan - which is unusual since I don't normally read those type of books (I've never read Narnia etc). My library had this book out on display as a recent best seller. It's a quick read. I think I finished it in under two hours. I wanted to read more! It also made me want to go back and reread all the Harry Potter books for things I might have missed. I love the fables - they are just as good as the \\"muggle\\" ones we grew up with. The lessons are great and I loved how Dumbledore explained and offered his take on it at the end of each one.     Overall if you like the Harry Potter series this is a nice addition to the mix.

0385532458|5.0|Just finished 'Ford County' Short stories by John Grisham. I was curious how he would make the transition from writing novels to writing short stories.I need not have worried,each of the seven stories was a gem.     They are all set in the fictional rural Mississippi county in which Girsham first novel \\"A time to kill' took place.My personal favorite was 'Funny boy' its about a young white gay man dying of Aids who comes back home to die.The year is 1989 and everybody is terrified of catching the disease. His family promptly sends him across the railway tracks to board in the black section of the town. In a not-so good writer's hand the story ran the risk of being sappy and melodramatic. Not with Grisham , he makes it funny and touching at the same time.    Another good one was \\"Micheal's room\\" where a lawyer who won a Malpractice lawsuit in favor of his client (an OBGYN) is kidnapped by the disabled child's father and spends an hour in the child's room with the child and his family. Again the story could have easily been judgmental, propaganda prone and righteous in tone but Grisham writes it with a clear eyed emphatic manner.    And the other one that had to be mentioned is \\"Quiet Haven\\" about a mole prowling a nursing home as an nurse-aid looking for lawsuit-causing neglect and seniors with forgotten rich wills. This could have been a tearjerker kind of topic but Grishm presents this as a sweet story without dejecting his readers.    I hope Grisham will continue his trend of writing short stories.
0071636080|5.0|I really like this book. Unlike many business books that wander around dozens of topics, this one covers just one thing, the presentations of Steve Jobs. And it does it well.<br /><br />On YouTube, I stumbled on Jobs' MacWorld keynote speech in 2007 where he introduced the iPhone. It's a great speech, and if you are at all interested in this topic, go watch it. This speech, and many others like it, are carefully dissected in this book, so that you can see the techniques that Jobs uses and how he uses them. Gallo refers to other speakers and experts from time to time, but the bulk of the book is about Steve Jobs.<br /><br />Gallo is rigorous in his references, describing the title and date of each Jobs speech he analyzes, and giving excerpts. YouTube comes in very handy here, hosting most of these speeches for us to study. I often found myself watching entire speeches, entranced by Jobs and his message. Inevitably, after reading more of the book, I would discover that I had witnessed several more of Jobs's well-rehearsed communication techniques.<br /><br />If you have doubts about buying this book, go watch a Jobs speech on YouTube. If you want your own presentations to be like his, this book is the reference that will tell you how.

B002HWRYJE|4.0|As A First Generation Fan of Star Trek I wish to thank J.J. Abrams for his vision on how to expose the core principles that Roddenberry imposed on Star Trek to the Fourth Generation. Following Gene's way would not have worked in this newest of fast-paced,high action Sci-Fi fans. The core principles being Hope for the Future and the inate ability of mankind to overcome obsticles with \\"Out of the Box\\" thinking. I sense future installments of this Star Trek. I \\"HOPE\\" so. Live Long and Prosper Star Trek.
B002HWRZH0|3.0|If you're looking for a movie review, I'll do a quick one below. The main focus here though is on the whole limited edition replica. I just got mine and I've got to say I'm a bit disappointed. It's a beautiful model, don't get me wrong. Really detailed and a lot better than some of the pewter models I'd seen circulating years ago.    The problem is the presentation. Outside of a little card, there is nothing to indicate just how \\"limited\\" it is. There isn't a number on the model or on the card like you'd expect. The packaging is ridiculously ho-hum. You look at that photo above and see the nice box? It's a nice cardboard box stuffed to the gills with styrofoam to protect the model--a good thing--but it's nothing special. I've seen plenty of game and movie sets that do something fancier with plastic, non-limited edition models and other junk. Yet here they just stuff the thing inside of some styrofoam, throw an index card (mass produced) and the Blu-Ray box on the top.     For an $80 (or more if it wasn't discounted) premium, I expected more...a lot more. Still I can't deny the model looks good. And about that movie...    The movie itself is a great ride. I admit I was worried (and still am in a way) about how JJ Abrams would do this movie. He's good at spinning tales (google \\"JJ abrams mystery box\\") and he definitely puts a good one together here. The cast is actually great. They manage to give all the characters a mix of the old (what you expect of their characters) and the new (some new quirks and the like). I still have the original crew burned into my head from years of reruns and general love for the series so it's a bit hard to \\"let go\\" of the history...something Mr. Abrams asks you to do.    I'm torn about how he decided to use a pretty standard Star Trek universe mechanism to give himself the freedom to change the way the original crew got started. On the one hand, it's a brilliant idea that doesn't stray far from the \\"reality\\" of Star Trek. On the other, it's a cop out from a potentially difficult or restrictive history he'd have to limit himself to.     In the end, you'll have a fun ride and unless you're so retentive that you can't stand the idea of seeing the existing Star Trek universe messed with in any way.    For those of you who have no idea what Star Trek is, beyond something that the geeks in your lives go nuts over, don't worry. Just think: it's sometime in our future. That's all you need to know. Everything else gets explained at some point in the movie and you really don't have to worry about the \\"grandfather paradox\\" that the movie creates but never discusses. That's for the physics geeks to worry about...
1400063736|3.0|I was very excited to read this book after I read a lot of great reviews of it.  Perhaps I was built up for it a tad too much, because I just felt disappointed with the results.  McCann is a great writer, capable of spinning some beautiful prose, but he is also capable of clunky schmaltz.  Every time I came across a particularly flowery sentence I just wanted to groan -- which is not a great recommendation for a book.  There are moments of brilliance, but they get bogged down in stories that are wildly varied in terms of quality.  It is also disappointing that the centerpiece of the collection -- Philippe Petit's walk between the towers -- feels so marginal and insignificant in parts.  I frequently felt disinterested in the stories and the lives depicted, so it took me a long time to slog my way through.  Ultimately, I can see why people like this book, but I am surprised that it has garnered as much praise as it has.  It's good, but in my opinion it is definitely not great.<br /><br />Grade: C
B000O9XA72|4.0|Asia's sophomore album arrived in July 1983. This was quite a fast production, considering that their previous album had only come out in April of 1982, which was then followed by months and months of touring.<br /><br />Bassist/vocalist John Wetton and keyboardist Geoff Downes had emerged as the main songwriting duo behind Asia. As a result, every song on here (as opposed to Asia's debut) is purely a Wetton/Downes credit. And I think this is one reason why it's not as universally-accepted as the debut album. Vocals and keyboards are a bit more dominant, Carl Palmer's drums aren't mixed as well...and where's Steve Howe? His guitars are a thin whisper on many of the tracks. His sole songwriting contribution to Alpha was \\"Lying To Yourself\\" and it was filed away to be issued as a B-side. No wonder he left in '84.<br /><br />It's not that I think Alpha is a bad album. In fact, it's quite stunning. It's just that it's more of the same, but not nearly as good. It repeats itself too much, and doesn't feel like a band effort. Too much money was up in the air and Asia had become too successful, too fast. Everyone had cabin fever when they wrote it, and egos were starting to clash within the group (mostly with Howe and Wetton, who's rift broke up the original group for 23 years.) Mix this in with huge arenas that had thousands of empty seats, as well as growing Euro-pop trends, and Asia -- and other hard rock bands -- were in trouble.<br /><br />\\"Don't Cry\\" starts off the album positively. Very nice vocals and some good drumming from Palmer. It's a pretty standard pop song, and it was the first Asia tune I ever heard. This song absolutely soars, and is incredibly uplifting.<br /><br />\\"The Smile Has Left Your Eyes\\" is a pretty little ballad driven by keyboards and vocals, and is solely credited to John Wetton. This was written in 1982, along with \\"Midnight Sun\\" -- both of which were played on the previous tour in different form. I think that the song turned out better in later years, played live and with a real piano sound as opposed to the Casio-sounding keyboards on this studio version.<br /><br />\\"Never In A Million Years\\" gets things rocking and the album starts to pick up some steam. Awesome vocals and some great keyboards, especially during the second verse. One wonders how much better this song had been with it's original intro, chopped off at the suggestion of a record executive because it \\"Made the song too long and less commercial.\\"<br /><br />\\"My Own Time (I'll Do What I Want)\\" is an amazing song. It begins with a bombastic fanfare and then quietly fades in with Wetton's distinctive smoky vocals coupled with some beautiful acoustic guitar from Howe. The song builds and builds, Wetton's singing just dripping with emotion and fire. Palmer's drumming is another highlight here, in addition to the short little keyboard \\"trumpets\\" that Downes plays as the song fades out.<br /><br />\\"The Heat Goes On\\" is often considered (along with \\"Open Your Eyes\\") to be the best song on Alpha. I won't go into too much detail, but everyone involved is at the top of their game in what is basically a straightforward classic rock tune. Play this loudly and people will likely ask who it is. A shame it gets no radio play. \\"The Heat Goes On\\" was originally titled \\"Eye of the Hurricane\\", but the lyrics were changed to basically make it a sequel to \\"Heat of the Moment\\". I would have preferred the original lyrics. (After the success of HotM, it struck me as kinda lame that they were trying to remind people of their biggest hit.)<br /><br />\\"Eye To Eye\\" is where the album starts to get a little slow. This song is very good, but gets a little repetitive, even as short as it is at three minutes or so. I *love* the keyboards though. Very icy-sounding, perfectly mirroring the lyrics and vocals. There's some wonderful instrumental pieces in here, subtly recalling Howe and Downes' 1980 Drama album under the Yes banner.<br /><br />\\"The Last To Know\\" used to be myleast-favorite song on Alpha but I enjoy it more these days. It's just that the lyrics are extremely sappy for guys in their 30's, and aside from when I remember myself at 13 in junior high, I can't relate. Nice classical interlude, though -- especially Palmer's drumming.<br /><br />I used to love \\"True Colors\\" when I first got Alpha... now it's my least-favorite. It just repeats the chorus over and over. Still good, but too keyboard-driven -- even if the darker sound does seem pretty cool.<br /><br />\\"Midnight Sun\\" used to not really do anything for me, but I grew to really enjoy it. Don't ask me how that happens. It's probably the most non-Asia-sounding song on Alpha, and one that Yes fans would probably dig on the most (Downes keyboards are a lot like the ones on Drama...the use of the Fairlight Excalibur really recalls that album.) The lyrics are very Sci-Fi, and whenever I hear it, I imagine a darkened red moon rising over a massive cityscape of Neo-Tokyo, straight out of some 80's anime movie.<br /><br />Alpha closes with \\"Open Your Eyes\\", a powerful lament for an Asian girl seeking fame and fortune in America. Thankfully, as on \\"The Heat Goes On\\", everybody overcomes the other pitfalls of Alpha and really shines forth as they did in '82. The lyrics are damn good, and I love the use of a vocoder during the intro and outro (as well as Howe's electric sitar, not used since \\"Close To The Edge\\" in '72!) As the song gets quiet and then thunders back for an ecstatic rush of an ending, I always get chills. Superb ending.<br /><br />If you love Asia's first album, by all means, get this. Chances are, you'll like it. In fact, a small minority regard it as better. You can make it even better by making a CD-R (or MP3 playlist) and adding the two B-sides, \\"Lying To Yourself\\" (goes good after \\"The Smile Has Left Your Eyes\\") and \\"Daylight\\" (a stunningly powerful and underrated Asia song) as an album-closer.<br /><br />I do hope that Geffen rereleases and repackages this someday. Especially because there's a lot more material which didn't make it -- the earlier versions of \\"The Heat Goes On\\" and \\"Never In A Million Years\\", as well as two previously-unreleased songs in \\"Jodi\\" and \\"Keep The Love Alive\\".<br /><br />As much as I love this album, I can only give it 3 stars. It loses one for the lyrics (not bad, but overall worse than the debut) and one for production (again, worse than the debut.)<br /><br />Ironically, one of Alpha's best features is Roger Dean's breathtaking cover art, which I would say is among one of his best works. In an odd juxtaposition, we see a Sci-Fi utopia of a pyramid and arcologies set amongst an exotic jungle. An eagle (representing freedom) flies overhead, joyful in the bright blue skies. Underneath the brush lay hidden black tigers peering between the leaves, representing an inner darkness. As a strange synchronicity, we see large blocky moth statues at the edges of the jungle, and if we look closely at the jungle leaves, the exact same moth lay perched...is it the architectural hand of God who sets events in motion? Maybe I read too much into it, but I tend to get lost in Roger Dean's worlds...<br /><br />3 stars + 1 for an emotional connectiont's just that the lyrics are extremely sappy for guys in their 30's, and aside from when I remember myself at 13 in junior high, I can't relate.

0307269981|3.0|Needless to say, if you are a fan of [[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Vintage)]], the first novel in Stieg Larsson's series, you will be sure to enjoy the second installment as well.  My one caveat for you is that this one is much more of a straight genre mystery/thriller, which may turn some off.  Dragon Tattoo was a highly complex story with multiple plots and layers of intrigue going on, and the fact that Larsson balanced these plots so deftly made it something of an achievement in the end.  Fire adheres much more to formula -- there's a murder, Lisbeth Salander is implicated and goes on the lam, and it is up to Mikael Blomkvist -- the only man who believes in Salander's innocence -- to clear her name and catch the real culprit.  There are scattered subplots, but nothing nearly as intricate or as layered as the previous installment.<br /><br />There are aspects of Fire that go a little off the rails, however.  The first hundred pages are a waste of time, since they have nothing to do with the plot and do nothing at all to set up the action.  Larsson seems to be using them to establish Salander as a renegade who operates on her own terms, with her own complicated set of morals that she follows.  The problem is that anyone who has read Dragon Tattoo (and I'm guessing that pretty much anyone picking up this novel will have done just that) already knows this, so what we have is a hundred pages of filler.<br /><br />The other, bigger problem with Fire is that there is a gaping contrivance at the novel's center -- a plot hole that Larsson can do nothing to fix.  You see, Lisbeth Salander knows the identity of the bad guy, the motive, etc. from the outset of the novel.  There isn't actually any mystery.  The only reason we have a plot is that she separates herself from Blomkvist and steadfastly refuses to give him any of her information -- even after he regains her trust.  Why?  No reason.  It's just that we wouldn't have a novel if Blomkvist didn't have to piece things together for himself.  And wouldn't that be a shame?<br /><br />In the end, Fire is an enjoyable enough read, but it must be taken as typical genre fluff instead of the smart genre-buster that Dragon Tattoo was.<br /><br />Grade: Cgs together for himself.  And wouldn't that be a shame?    In the end, Fire is an enjoyable enough read, but it must be taken as typical genre fluff instead of the smart genre-buster that Dragon Tattoo was.      Grade: C

B002QEXN2K|4.0|Here is the deal. The likeliness of John Mayer ever creating an album that will rival Continuum is slim to none. Period. He knows this, and mentioned in an interview that trying to outdo something like that would be crazy and near-impossible, so he chose to explore a different tributary of his creativity. This album is also very original in the sense that it is hard to pin down as any particular style of music (although most would say it is some kind of pop). I was hoping this album would be a coffee-house acoustic album, and was certainly disappointed initially. However, If you are willing to listen to it a few times, your opinion of the album is likely to improve. The songs in Battle Studies are slightly over produced, and minimalist at the same time (a weird concept I know).     Guitar takes a back seat for most of these songs, but if you are willing to listen to the tracks less intensely and more for the ambiance than for deep thinking, there is a lot you can get out of this album.  Friends, Lovers, or Nothing, Do you know me, All We Ever Do Is Say Goodbye, and Perfectly Lonely are really good songs. Heartbreak Warfare and Assassin are probably the worst of them all, and the remaining tracks fall somewhere in between.     I WOULD recommend buying the whole album, which is a pretty eclectic album when you have acoustic songs like Who Says and strangely-distorted songs like Crossroads all on the same album, but if you are expecting anything like Continuum, you WILL be disappointed. That being said, if you are open-minded enough and ready for a different John Mayer, who is choosing a more simplistic, laid-back approach to his latest album, then Battle Studies is ultimately worth your money.
B000002JNJ|5.0|I listen to this album 3 or 4 times a week.This is one of my favorite albums.It has my favorite Pantera song Cemetary Gates.
B002HRTMHQ|5.0|Mayer has this falsetto voice that harkens back to Motown, but with a modern 2010 vibe--the arrangements and his style are a whisper of the past and a hint of the \\"right now.\\" Head bopping and cool. Mayer Hawthorne put a smile on my face.
B00200K2UG|5.0|Exceptional quality camera bag with lots of divided sections. It fits two SLR or DSLR cameras with mounted lenses and six additional lenses, two flashes, camera compact flash memory. lens filters, hood lenses and more...<br />Based on my experience I could say that I am very satisfied with the product.<br /><br />I would like to thank Tamrac employees for the work and design of the camera bag.
0767020308|2.0|After looking at several reviews for this product (having already watched it myself), I must say I am surprised at the strong reviews. I thought Emma and Mr. Knightley were NOT cast well at all. Since you know they get together in the end, you'd expect some kind of cameraderie and friendship to come through. Instead, they act like they dislike each other much of the time. I know they quarrel in the book, but this felt more mean-spirited to me...in real life it's unlikely this couple would have fallen in love! This version lacked the charm of the Gwyneth Paltrow version and especially the latest Romola Garai version, where Mr. Knightley really does seem like an older brother who genuinely cares about Emma. With the latter two Emmas to watch, who needs this one?!
B001JAFYFG|2.0|My comments pertain only to the Blu-Ray version.  The technical quality is very disappointing for me.  The sharpness and detail does not compare to most of the other Blu-Ray titles I have watched.  It is much improved over the DVD version, but that isn't saying much, because the DVD release of this title looked like a bad dub of a bad VHS tape.  This Blu-Ray release is comparable to what the earlier DVD release should have looked like.  The back indicates that it is released through the Turner and Warner Bros operations, so I suppose that says a lot.  I wish that companies such as these would throw in the towel and turn this stuff over to companies that care at least a little bit about the quality of the product, as opposed to how much revenue it generates.  They care only about how much revenue it generates, and for the most part could care less whether the technical quality is up to the standard for the media.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|What caught my attention about this series was the relationship between the two brothers, who are protecting people while looking for their Mom's killer and their missing Dad.  Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles are incredible as brothers Sam and Dean with Jefferey Dean Morgan playing their father John...the subtle play of emotions between the three is well done-I'm convinced that they really are father and sons.  The fact that what is being hunted are monsters based upon Urban Legends and Folklore is a bonus for me-I can't get enough of these stories! My favorite episodes are the ones with Meg Masters...Nicki Aycox is so scary good playing this character...and she gives the Winchesters a run for their money (actually lives).
031606792X|3.0|Breaking Dawn picks up not long after Eclipse left off: erstwhile heroine Bella Swan has chosen Edward Cullen as her suitor, and rival Jacob Black has taken off to parts unknown in his grief.      The first third of the book is in Bella's voice, and details the events leading up to her nuptials and honeymoon with Edward. For folks who are reading these for the vampire/human star-crossed romance, this is likely to be the highlight of the book. You all might want to stop at the honeymoon night and pretend the rest of the book doesn't exist. For this reader, the creepy ending to Part One was an unexpectedly spooky delight.    Part Two is in Jacob's voice, and follows his growing suspicion that something weird is afoot at the Cullen mansion, and that it's centered around his beloved Bella. Jacob is absolutely correct, though his initial guesses are pretty far off the mark. He grows determined to save her, no matter what it takes. At first, skipping to Jacob's point of view was a bit frustrating because the story left off from quite a suspenseful moment, but I came to enjoy his perspective so much that I was disappointed when it ended. I came to enjoy this series primarily because of this character -- I'd read Twilight and could take it or leave it, but friends told me to stick with the books for the growing role of Jacob Black, and they were right. As other readers have noted, Edward comes across as a grown man with control issues, but Jacob seems more like a real teenage boy. He loves Bella, he really does, but that's not going to stop him from doing whatever he has to do to get into her sleeping bag. The juxtaposition between these characters kept me enthralled through New Moon and Eclipse. Part Two of Breaking Dawn sees Jacob forming new relationships to the people in his life and ends with a wrinkle that is, frankly, less delightfully creepy than it is just plain creepy.    Part Three is back to Bella's perspective, and it is a very new perspective for her. It tookme a while to enjoy it. I found her outrageous flavor amusing in the previous books, but in this part, (spoilers ahoy!) she has become powerful enough to cause physical damage to others, and she proceeds to do just that. I wanted to thrash her for a goodly portion of this part, much more so than usual. Eventually, though, she is forced to face a challenge that taxes her inner resources, which has always been when her character is most interesting to me. The monster at the end of this book is vampire politics, and between them, and Kate and Garrett, it made for a pretty decent final part. Seriously, if Meyer wants to write the romance of Kate and Garrett, I'm in.    All in all, this book touched on the tensions and relationships that made the middle two books in this series entertaining to me, just enough to keep me reading through to the end. I won't be making permanent space for it on my bookcase, but I'm not sorry I read it, either. Amazon's handling of the order was as competent as it usually is, so no complaints there. Still, if you're on the fence about reading this one, you might want to pick it up in the library first.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|I was rather dreading taking my kids to the movies, although I had heard that the movie was \\"cute\\".  I also heard that there was little to no dialog, so that made my dread even worse.  As I watched the movie, I couldn't believe it...Pixar has done it again, and even better than Toy Story.  I laughed and cried along with my kids, and we all found something to love about this movie.  It might sound corny, but this is a fantastic family movie that everyone will enjoy - and it covered science fiction to romance.  I worry about adult themes or suggestive topics, even in children's movies, but I found nothing objectionable here.  Even the littlest child will be entertained, and the adults will be as well.  Good job, Pixar.  We're getting the 3-disk edition for Christmas this year!
0882709194|5.0|To those of you who are interested in reading this book, please, do not pay any attention to the one star reviews. They were submitted by atheists who have not read the book. They are outraged that Ray Comfort has added his own introduction to the \\"Origin of Species\\" that provides evidence for intelligent design, the theory that the universe and life is the result of an intelligent creator. They also did this to his book \\"You Can Lead an Atheist to Evidence But You Can't Make Him Think\\" in hopes of discouraging people from buying it. Not only have they given this book low ratings but, have threatened book burnings, protests, and have also threatened to rip out the introduction. The whole thing is absolutely ridiculas and only shows that atheists obviously don't have enough faith in their so called \\"evidence\\" that they proclaim undoubtedly points to evolutions existence. If they did, they wouldn't feel so threatened having absolute assurance the reader will see through the inanity of the theory of Intelligent Design when compared to Darwin's Theory of Evolution.
0385504225|1.0|I was a huge Dan Brown fan, even before he was popular.  Alas, this is no longer true.  \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is a POOR piece of writing!  Many of these reviews, however, are very entertaining!  I totally agree with those who are disappointed with Brown's formulaic approach.  It reminds me of a \\"Madlib,\\" where the players add words to blanks in a prewritten vignette.  Fill in the blanks for: a cult-like aspect of a mainstream religion or belief; an odd, deviant eunuch on a mission that threatens to reveal a closely guarded secret of the cult-like group; a revered and beloved, older man who is an expert in his field; a brilliant daughter-figure of the old man; a setting in a well-known major city with lots of history.    Every writing teacher admonishes students at every level to \\"show, don't tell.\\"  Too bad Brown has forgotten this lesson.  During the frequent \\"chase scenes,\\" Brown tells us every turn the characters make, being sure to mention any D.C. landmark.  Is he trying to convince us he is really familiar with Washington D.C., or is trying to make readers who know D.C. feel like insiders?  Often repeated phrases such as \\"He looked on in shock\\" or \\"Suddenly it all made sense,\\" the inner narratives, and the lectures by Katherine and Peter tell, don't show the reader what to think.        The last part of the book is so preachy that I was reminded of \\"The Shack.\\"  Even though Brown's other best sellers dealt with religion, the resolution of each was dependent on Langdon's bravery and brilliance.  The resolution of \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is just pages and pages of Katherine and Peter's pedantic preaching!  It makes Langdon look like an idiot.  The book should have ended shortly after the helicopter scene (obviously written for the movie).  And while I'm on the subject of the Peter's preaching, it is totally unbelievable that an older man with a severed hand could carry on the way he did!!!    My sense is that Brown has followed his editor's instructions to capitalize on the success of his previous two best sellers by writing the same book again with different details.  My hope is that Brown will have the courage to write a more original book next time, or not write another book at all.  I wonder if an unknown writer had submitted this book, if it would have even been considered for publication.
0452295548|3.0|This book offered great insight into traumatic brain injury through the eyes of one of its \\"victims\\". This book was written for the general public but as a student of the hard sciences i found it to be on the \\"touchy feely\\", metaphysical side (You are one with the universe.. i get it, next). With that being said, there are still lessons to be learned from the life of Taylor. If you are looking for book about nuerological science and brain injuries this may not be the book for you. But I can see it as a great self help/inspirational book for those who are affected by stroke/brain injuries in any way.
B000E1155E|5.0|Anyone who is a fan of punk rock or indie, this album is a must-have. I have listened to it over a hundred times and each time it gets better. There are songs that command you to head bang like \\"The View From The Afternoon\\", \\"When The Sun Goes Down\\", and \\"I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor\\". \\"Riot Van\\" and \\"Mardy Bum\\" are great songs that are slower and more emotional. The rest of the songs are just as amazing. The Arctic Monkeys create their own style. The guitars and punchy bass are really their own- it sounds like nothing I have heard before.     Alex Turners vocals bring the whole album together. The lyrics are original and well written. I know the lyrics and it's tough to sing along because Turner sings with such emotion and cleverness.
0786868724|5.0|A book to lead you towards believing in something bigger than yourself - where spreading faith and hope and making a difference in the lives of others is what it's all about.  This is a warm-hearted, inspiring book where the talented author Mitch Albom examines how faith shines differently in people's expressions. Mitch writes about the spiritual journey of two holy men, one a rabbi close to death and the other an inner-city  pastor. Each of these holy men express their faith in different ways but, none the less, their faith supports and sustains many of their congregation through trying and difficult times.  And of the author's own journey, well that evolves into one of grace, compassion and meaning in his own life.     While reading Mr. Albom's work I was reminded of Ariel and Shya Kane's book \\"[[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]]\\". The Kanes' book is also rich in real life stories filled with compassion, inspiration and sharing of life's magical moments. Both of these wonderful books hold a place of honor on my bookshelf. I know they would be a gift to anyone who reads them.
B001992NUQ|5.0|Just when I thought they are going to use the old DVD title, They surprise you. I thought they put the wrong disc in case. I love their sense of humor.   If you are not a fight club fan, please do not get it! I have waited for this fight club Blu Ray release for 2 years. I own this movie in seven versions. If they keep releasing new version of this movie. I will keep buying it.
B002Q4U9YU|4.0|Music: 5 stars; Sentimental Value: 4 stars; Compilation: 2 stars<br /><br />I saw the movie \\"Michael Jackson: This Is It\\" (more on that later) and this is the album that was released along with it. It is a head-scratcher on many levels. I picked this up from my local library the other day.<br /><br />\\"Michael Jackson: This Is It\\" (and listed as \\"The music that inspired the movie\\" on the CD sleeve) consists of 2 CDs. CD1 (16 tracks; 78 min.) brings the studio versions of the songs heard in the movie, and to its credit, in the order that the songs appear in the movie. But aside that, it's just another 'greatest hits' compilation of stellar songs we all love but we also already have, so why buy it? That's where CD2 (4 tracks; 14 min.) comes in. It brings in order: a stellar demo of \\"She's Out of My Life\\", featuring only Michael and an acoustic guitar, just superb; a demo version of \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something\\" that is mildely interesting; a fantastic 2 min. demo version of \\"Beat It\\", totally a capella with mutilple vocal overdubbing, wow; and finally a 3 min. spoken word poem \\"Planet Earth\\" by Michael.<br /><br />In all, this set carries a lot of sentimental value of hearing the songs in the order they appeared in the movie, but I simply cannot understand why they didn't release the actual soundtrack of the movie, which would've been an immediate must-have for any Michael Jackson fan. This release simply is not a must-have. All that aside, the movie itself is a must-see for any MJ fan, and for any serious buff of music history. Can't wait to buy the DVD when it comes out.
B000P6J8TS|5.0|Eerie,post-nuclear-there is no music in this film!It doesn't need it,really-the atmosphere is all created by the bird sounds-truly terrifying and unforgettable.  Hitchcock was way ahead of his time with this one-it almost plays like an IFC movie but years before the idea of a quality independent film was fashionable.The fact that a major studio like Universal released this is quite astonishing.From the birds chipping away at the opening title in that amazing sequence to the quiet,foreboding ending-this is one that is a must for collectors.It almost defies description-scifi,horror,thriller-all three,really.

1401323820|4.0|For fans of the TV show \\" Castle\\", this is a treat.  This book is supposedly written by the TV character, Richard Castle. The book follows the premise of the TV Show and reads like an episode from the weekly dramedy.      For those who have no idea who Castle is, then this would be a quick read.  The plot involves a journalist who is shadowing a detective squad while doing research for a magazine article.  As the Homicide Detective, Nikki Heat, chaffs at having a nosy reporter follow her and her team when trying to solve a high-profile murder, she also finds the journalist attractive. And he has his moments.  He knows everyone in town, plays poker with judges, knows celebrities and con artists and provides his expertise whenever he wants.  Not that the detectives welcome it, mind you, he just runs his mouth whenever.    Clues, twists and turns lead the detectives on a chase to locate the murderer among a list of suspects.  Money, or lack of, a cheating wife, a cheating husband, and mob characters, all come together to create a fast-paced and enjoyable romp through a Manhattan Heat Wave.  As the bodies stack up, so do the clues.  Finding out whio is guilty may take longer than expected.    The book is full of dialogue and easy to follow.  When the \\"author\\" acknowledges the real-life actors from the show, its all one can do to keep a straight face.  The picture of the author is actor Nathan Fillion who plays Castle on the TV show.  The bio on the inside flap refers to Castle, the character, so the real mystery here is who is the actual author of this book?
B000002I77|5.0|Perhaps one of the 5 most important and influential jazz-rock albums of all time.  Of course \\"Stratus\\" and \\"Red Baron\\" are now fusion classics, but Spectrum also contains some tunes that are not as well known but are among Billy Cobham's best; \\"Le Lis\\" (which has one of Jan Hammer's best Minimoog solos) and the title track, which features Ron Carter and the Brecker Brothers.  I swear I've listened to this record so much that it is part of my DNA.   If you don't know this record then drop everything and order it right now.
B002MW50KO|5.0|I am glad  to have purchased Christmas in the Heart.  I have been listening to the CD often and hearing the traditional carols has roused the Christmas  Spirit early.

B002NXSSBU|2.0|I received my copy of the Audio Fidelity remaster of Rod Stewart's 'Never a Dull Moment' today.  I give this item only 2 stars due to the poor packaging.  Normally, this is not something I care too much about.  But, in this case, I feel that it does have an impact.  The CD itself is in a slimline case with the spindle on the front, rather than the back side.  The disc it put in backwards to make the title visible.  The actual cover is separate and is over sized in the respect that it would not fit into any jewel case, let alone the backwards slimline provided.  While the idea may have been to reproduce the original album packaging (can't say, since I never owned the original vinyl), I don't feel it adds any value.  Overall, it looks like perhaps this is some kind of packaging experiment that gave no consideration to practicality.  I prefer to be able to store my discs with their packaging and with the disc right-side up and on the right side of the case when it is a single disc.  The cover does have a pocket that may be intended as storage for the disc, I don't really know.  I do know that I'm not going to store this kind of disc in such a way as to invite damage.  As to the remaster, it's not bad, but nothing to write home about either (as I have found with many of the Audio Fidelity titles).  Like others I have purchased, it requires a bit more volume to really bring the low end out.  So, two stars from this customer.  A passable remaster and, in my opinion, some unfortunate packaging decisions.
0312330537|5.0|Shantaram is an epic story, part memoir, part fiction, of one man's journey to understand the meaning of life, love and fate. Some reviewers here have mentioned that the author is a lifelong criminal with a violent history and does not deserve the praise he has received. His story undoubtedly supports such a violent history. But if the reader goes into the book knowing that some of the morals and decisions portrayed are not exemplary and reflect the author's rough past, he or she will be rewarded with the many gems hidden through the book about life, love, longing, regret, and fate. The story itself is grand in its scope and detail, but it delivers in a big way. Never again will I read a book that describes India or its people as well and colorful as I did in Shantaram. At over 900 pages of small text, this book is not a weekend read. I finished it in just over two months, but the thoughts, ideas and descriptions will stay with me much longer. The only thing I wish I would've done is highlight or mark the passages of text I found so eloquent for future reference. The author is a gifted writer. I am anxious to see how the 2011 movie version of Shantaram compares, although I am confident that the book will always remain the definitive work.
0316017922|4.0|Gladwell's insights are helpful in some ways in describing a very small percentage of the popular outlier stories.  But I think it places a little bit too much emphasis on luck and opportunity rather than on gift, intellect, and pure skill.  For example, he goes into great detail about how Bill Gates was so lucky to be where he was at the right time, in the right location, knowing the right people, and having access to the right things.  However, I think if you put someone else in Bill Gates shoes, events would not be guaranteed to turn out the same just because that `someone else' was in place of Bill Gates luck and opportunity.<br /><br />In other places of the book, his insights are helpful at understanding the present issues with education and the trends among cultures in the differences in educational level.  His explanation of why Chinese kids are smarter due to their hard life at the rice paddies and the Chinese language in itself seems to help grasp the advantages they have over other cultures.  I also thought his 10,000 hours explanation was insightful on how hard work pays off in any activity or hobby or sport.<br /><br />Overall, though, I think Gladwell's insights are brief and very high level.  There are a lot more reasons for the success stories of the people described in his book than the sole reason of luck/chance/opportunity.  Some people make their own opportunity.  The examples in the book seem to only support his thesis and disregard the other thousands of success stories that didn't rely so much on luck.  The book is also very un-analytical in each idea that is presented.  To say that this book helps grasp the major trends in present society is to break down society in very simple terms and disregard all the other variables, no matter how small, out of the equation.  The book is also very one-dimensional as every story or event results in the same theme, the same thesis, and the same idea.  Gladwell's insights are really his insight, singular, because all he has done is write several chapters on the same scene of a story.has done is write several chapters on the same scene of a story.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|There are a number of ways to praise this film.  For instance, while I missed it in the theater I had heard nothing but great things about it and was awaiting the film on Blu-ray with great expectations.  Far too often when you look forward to a movie with this kind of enthusiasm you end up getting disappointed.  And I have to say that I was very disappointed with the beginning of the film.  The whole-birth-of-Kirk-at-the-height-of-a-great-battle thing left me laughing and unhappy.  It was, however, the only part of the movie that I disliked.  So it is high praise to say that I loved this movie despite expecting to love it.<br /><br />Here is another way to praise it.  Almost all movies that are remakes try to work in former stars in cameos of one sort or another.  While it is usually nice to see them, their appearances are almost always throwaways.  The use of Leonard Nimoy in this film is hand's down the best I've ever seen of an original cast member in a remake.  Without going into details -- I intend this to be a spoiler free review -- Nimoy's role is not a cameo.  He in fact has a pretty important role.  It was simply wonderful that it wasn't a tacked on appearance or one that was irrelevant to the main course of the film.<br /><br />Another way to praise it is that I actually preferred it to the original.  That may be heresy, but while I always liked the original series, I was never passionately in love with it.  Like Orson Scott Card (with whom I almost always agree with in assessing SF TV and movies even while disagreeing passionately with him on politics), I never felt that the original series was actually very good SF.  I honestly believe that I prefer everyone of the new ST characters to their original counterparts, with the exception of Spock.  Mind you, I don't prefer the new versions hugely, with one exception, but I still thoroughly enjoyed all of them.  The one huge exception is Chris Pine as Kirk.  For me the original series was seriously crippled by William Shatner and if asked to compile a list of the worst actors that I've ever seen on TV, he would top the list.  I'd have to think about who would be #2.  Chris Pine was, for me, everything that Shatner was not.  He was simultaneously brash and funny, heroic and self-effacing.  And his acting decisions were never, well, weird.  If you watch the original series and put yourself in Shatner's shoes, some of -- well, make that huge numbers of -- his decisions are utterly perverse.  No once watching Pine, however, did I wonder about his decisions.  He brought charisma to a role that for me Shatner brought only strangeness.<br /><br />Clearly J. J. Abrams has to receive major kudos for the success of the film.  Working with a script by his fellow FRINGE executive producers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, he produced a movie that put to shame most other films based on prior TV series.  He managed to reintroduce all of the familiar characters, but in ways that not only did not slow down the story but actually advanced the narrative.  I've had enormous respect for J. J. Abrams over the years.  I have a theory that he describes a crucial line between intelligence and popular appeal on TV.  Below the line and you get increasingly less intelligent TV producers.  Above the line and you get smart but niche television.  Not that many people are above the line, but the ones who do produce absolutely brilliant TV series that have serious trouble attracting viewers.  Joss Whedon, Ronald D. Moore, Bryan Fuller, and Matthew Weiner are among this smaller group of producers.  Their work is passionately loved by TV critics, college students and professors, other TV writers and producers, and academic writers, but their shows are not watched by large numbers of viewers.  Still, it isn't like Abrams makes TV for dummies, and I've loved many aspects of his TV series.  After Joss Whedon, Abrams may have done more for heroic females on TV than anyone else.  And while at his best he maynot cause your jaw to drop down to your ankles like Whedon or Ronald Moore can, he still can be surprising and exciting.  STAR TREK is very close to Abrams best work and I very much hope that we will see a follow up to this first film sooner rather than later.<br /><br />One of the things that I do enjoy about a J. J. Abrams production is that he love to bring back people he has worked with before.  Not just Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, but Rachel Nichols, who was superb in the final season of ALIAS (and who had a great love scene with Kirk in this one) and Amanda Foreman, who was in both FELICITY and ALIAS.  And of course, Greg Grunberg manages to find his way into all of Abrams's productions sooner or later (though not yet in FRINGE, as far as I know).  Here he only manages to provide the voice of Kirk's step-father, but it is the kind of cameo that works well.drop down to your ankles like Whedon or Ronald Moore can, he still can be surprising and exciting.

B0029O08WA|3.0|I loved the Twilight Soundtrack, so my hopes were very high for New Moon.  The first time or two I listened to it I did not like it.  After listening several more times I began liking some of the songs.  I've had it now for about a month and I would say that I really like 3 of the 15 songs.  Eleven songs are mediocre and the song Roslyn is downright awful.  Besides sounding bad or boring, I don't feel that many of the songs fit. They don't capture the emotion of the book. I was expecting to get a feel for the depression Bella went through and maybe something very exciting as she races to save Edward.  I think much better songs and artists could have been chosen for this soundtrack.  Disappointing.

B001993Y2C|5.0|Ok, I am going to gush about Battlestar Galactica because I believe that is was the best show written for television, hands down.  I can't believe that we got the priviledge of watching this on free tv (sci-fi network or now know as syfy).  Well, not so much free as nothing is cheap about cable companies these days.  Anyway.. the packaging, as people say, could have been much much better. They should have given us options on the packaging because most people, like myself, just really only care about the DVD and I would have like to have seen it in traditional dvd packagaing.  But the DVDs were hard to get to and you can't see what disc is what unless you physically remove it from it's package.  Enough about the package, on to the show.    Ok, the mini-series, first 4 episodes looks grainy and people say it is on purpose.  I own the first season on HD-DVD as well as Standard Def and I don't see anything that makes it look any better in blu-ray.  I figure that because it was release so long ago maybe they use inferior cameras to film it and the whole HD and Blu ray craze hadn't kicked into full gear until after the miniseries.  But starting with the episodes 33 1/3 until season ending, everything looks and sounds great.  The clarity is great and the sound is fantastic.  Plus on blu-ray you have U-Control and for a fan, its cool to watch the series with that on and you get to see interviews with the cast, crew and writers.  So the blu ray is packed with TONS of bonus features.      What is missing in the description of this box set is that fact that RAZOR IS INCLUDED!  It's in the fourth box set i think, also the WEBISODES are included also.  So you get the complete package and you don't have to purchase anything further (except the Plan with came out much later).  Not included in this is Caprica but that is a completely different series-to-be.      As far as the series, it is the best writing, with wonderful acting by all.  Edward James Olmos is great as Adama and gives the series validity because of his past work as an actor and you have 2x Oscar nominated Mary McDonnell as the president. But it is the newcombers that makes the series work.  (I am only going to name characters here), Starbuck, Apollo, Dee, Chief, Gauis, Gaeta, Six, Boomer, etc... where did these people come from.  They are amazing and I was initially upset that the previous show was changed so much.  But what they did is what convinced me that I was watching something special. One thing I must say for sure.  You must watch this series from episode one through the end.  Its not an independent episode type of show.  It is one long engrossing story that is unfolds like a great book.  Be forewarned also, once you start to watch you may have a tendency to watch the show back to back to back.  This is story first, sci-fi second.    For me, BSG (Battlestar Galactica) Blu-ray DVD is a multi-viewable, meaning you will find yourself watching the series over again on blu-ray and still be fascinated about it all.  Unfortunately I bought it during the pre-sale and it was more for me than the current $200.00 and change price tag. This would make a fantastic gift for people you know who were fans of the show and who has a blu-ray player.  And it is so complete, I can't stress that enough.  Not even the standard def DVDs have the webisodes.  Plus you have somewhere in the neiborhood of Season 1, Season 2.0, Season 2.5, Season 3, Season 4.0 and Season 4.5 to purchase, plus you have to purchase Razor.  You get it all in one package with this set.  Buy it if you are a fan and buy it for fans or for someone who you think will really like this show.
0439023491|5.0|What is there to say that hasn't already been said?  I won't waste space on a plot summary but just give my reactions to the book.  There is always the threat of being disappointed after reading a much-hyped book, especially one that is a sequel to a bestselling book.  I think this one avoids the sophomore slump, especially since I enjoyed it much more on its own--forgetting that it is a sequel--than many other books I've read this year.  Comparing it to its predecesor, The Hunger Games, may be a disservice since the universe and its surprises were first revealed there, but this one continues the exciting fun and won't disappoint 99% of its fans.  I know I'll preorder the third book without a second thought and expect to be thoroughly entertained yet again.  Collins does something different and twisty from the other popular books right now and comes across as refreshing as a result.  Highly recommended.

Heart-pumping and tough on the muscles.  It puts the Firm workouts (which I'm a huge fan of) to shame.  This has become my go-to dvd for quick and effective 20 minute workouts! I highly recommend it.

There are 4 songs I like off the album, but it really is awesome.  I wish more musicians would do things like this playing tribute to those that came before you.  Not just playing their own versions of a song or artist, but actually finding them and jamming with them.  This album and DVD was done very well and is worth every penny.
0882709194|1.0|I was handed this book for free by an avid Christian group on campus the other day. And after reading the first 50 page introduction which practically says Darwin's theory of evolution is all BS without and evidence to support it other than referencing the bible, I strongly urge no one to buy this version of the book. It is heavily biased and ridiculously embellished with unproven claims about evolution. DO NOT GET THIS VERSION! BUY THE ORIGINAL VERSION! :)
0740785508|5.0|James Gurney's Imaginative Realism is truly and impressive book and a work of art in and of itself.  This isn't your average \\"how to draw such and such\\" type book.  This is historical and methodical, referring even to the masters of the field and various methods.  There are even chapters detailing the studio and various media.      This book is interesting whether or not you want to perform any of the techniques involved.  The illustrations and images are grand and the text is enjoyable.  This book takes the reader into the world of the creator and tells his story all the while instructing the interested artist in the ways and methods of creating realism in the unreal.      This book has been my introduction to James Gurney and I have to say it is a very impressive first impression.  This is clearly a very talented individual, not only in his art, but in writing, as well.  I am truly impressed.
B000FS9FC6|1.0|The original Graphic novel this was based on is one of the smartest and best stories written last century. It's ig iea stuff examining the extremes of government and policies. It has no 2D characters but instead flushes out and makes you understand even if you don't like) all of them. It's timeless and never needs to be \\"updated\\" because it's about ideas that are still there today and were there long before the book was written.     This film claims to be an update on said story. But aparently update means they must skew a balanced look at polotics as a concept into an onslaught on the bush campaign. On top of that they took all these full developed characters and turned them into the very black and white nazi liek characters Alan Moore intentionally didn't write in the book.    This is a terrible movie that degrades everything the book stands for.

0545123267|5.0|Honestly, at my age I didn't expect much from this book- especially in pop cultures current Twilight-fever. Still, I heard some good things so I thought I'd give it a shot- and I am incredibly thankful for those who were vocal about this fantastic book. It starts of very slow and even quiet- the atmosphere is chilled, and the writing is in a very minimalist style. It keeps that feeling but slowly builds the surrounding, the characters and their relationships- this may be a book about werewolves but it's written in such a down-to-earth manner than I can honestly say it felt realistic.<br /><br />Is this a romance? Well our main characters are definitely in love, but we're shown that years before they officially \\"met\\" the feelings have been growing through longing. Grace- our intelligent 17-year-old protagonist with criminally neglectful parents. Sam is our werewolf who, in the warm months, is an attractive and very likable 18-year-old boy. Their relationship is so awkward and wonderfully paced (no \\"soul mates\\" or \\"I want to be bonded to you for life\\" with these two- they'd rather curl up with some good books together while sneaking in a few kisses) that every little \\"event\\" in their relationship made me giddy like a pre-teen. But beyond that we have a look into Grace's relationship with her often-absent parents- though one of the books few flaws is that nothing really comes from that. It's also a great look into how great friendships we start at a young age can slowly drift as we reach adulthood. I loved how every character had flaws and their reasons, yet they also were sympathetic. Some of the \\"good guys\\" do repellent things but are still good at heart, and some of the things the \\"bad guys\\" do is sympathetic because of their situation or history- just like in real life. All of this is contained into an action/adventure/mystery story, which is somehow really compelling even in Stiefvater's sparse, slow prose.<br /><br />When I finally caved and read \\"Twilight\\" I was disappointed, but chalked it up to being way past my teen years so I just couldn't get excited about the romance. But reading \\"Shiver\\" made me re-think that opinion. The age group is the same and it's still \\"paranormal\\", yet the writing was exquisite and the characters are all fully fleshed out and interesting. This may be targeted toward pre-teen and teenage readers but Steiefvater never panders. \\"Shiver\\" is what I wanted \\"Twlight\\" to be- well-written, compelling, and starring two characters who I not only believed would be in love with each other- but I wanted them to be. No spoilers, but at the end my heart felt full and I smiled like an idiot. It's been a while since a book affected me like that, so I can't recommend this highly enough- no matter WHAT your age.but chalked it up to being way past my teen years so I just couldn't get excited about the romance.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|Contains essential mixes of all albums ( minus Abbey Road, Let It Be and Yellow Submarine), singles and compilation appearances in glorious  vintage mono sound. Yes the sound is condensed and may not be as effective as the remastered stereo versions but who cares they sound so good and pure.  I don't have original mono copies of any Beatles LP's as a comparison,  only the hollow duophonic  stereo ones released in the 70's and 80's. Even my 87 CD versions of Revolver , Rubber Soul and White Album sound better than those.<br />The whole set does their recorded output a big solid favor. You would have to be a jerk to not think they sound better or a waste of money. I'm sure a remix of their albums will come but do you really want to change the recordings that much?<br />Expensive but money well spent. I enjoy the slight differences in Revolver and Sgt. Pepper andThe White Album the most. Rubber Soul, Help and A Hard Days Night are untouchable. These mixes are really concentrated and get into your head. I would even recommend one get them in remastered stereo. They are all brilliant.
B002NOAF9W|4.0|Back in February 2001, the very first review I ever wrote for Amazon was a five star review of the Rolling Stones' album, \\"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!\\" Why? Thats an easy answer. It's my all time favorite live album. I love the rough, grungy, almost punkish feel to it. It just seems to be permeated throughout, with a crackling energy, thats' just so alive. \\"Ya-Yas\\" to me is what the Rolling Stones and Rock n' Roll for that matter, should be all about. As rock critic, Dave Marsh has been quoted as saying,\\"it just might have been recorded on a night, that the Rolling Stones, really were the world's greatest Rock n' Roll band\\".<br /><br />So with that in mind, I was quite excited to find out that \\"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!\\" was being re-released in a \\"40th Anniversary Deluxe Box\\" Set\\". There is so little from this time period of the Rolling Stones' history, that is officially released. Have they given us more Rock n'Roll nectar? Could this finally be our Stones 'Holy Grail'? Well not exactly...<br /><br />This is a box set with both good and bad points. The good points are that the new stuff, that is included is really fantastic! If you are a collecter of Classic Rock you will absolutely eat this stuff up! The bad news is that this fantastic new stuff has been unecessarily spread out across four discs to somehow justify an outrageous list price. This is done to the detriment of the set's content.<br /><br />Here is the layout. Disc 1 is the original remastered, classic \\"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out\\" on CD. If your spending your hard earned sheckels on this box, then I can pretty easily guess, ya got it already (am I wrong?). Disc 2 is 5 unreleased tracks. Wonderful, amazing stuff! I love it! Like mannah from heaven! But its only 5 tracks folks! I don't want to sound ungrateful, but those 5 tracks could have easily been put on the first disc in the proper set list order! I guess this is why 'playlists' were invented for iTunes (sigh...). Disc 3 are the opening acts of B.B.King plus Ike and Tina Turner. I have no problem with this. They perform good, short, energetic sets, that give you a sense of the flavor of the evening. You can feel the anticipation of the audience as they await their beloved Stones.<br /><br />Disc 4 is the DVD. This is really where the good stuff is. The meat and potatos. The stuff to make your buddy, who wouldn't splurge on this box, jealous. I really wasn't expecting much, when I popped the disc into the DVD player. But by the end of the all too short 28 minutes of footage, my jaw was on the floor. This is film shot by the Maysles Brothers. The same folks that brought us \\"Gimme Shelter\\". But unlike \\"Gimme Shelter\\" the Stones are at their Rock n' Roll peak. They are in total command of the audience and you can feel the energy. You really get a sense of what an event this was and how MSG must have seemed like the center of the universe. If that wasn't good enough, then even better is the back stage footage, which shows the boys at rest and play (including shots of Janis Joplin plus footage of Jimi Hendrix hanging out, playing guitar). The cherry on the sundae though is footage of the Stones and their entourage meeting up at a helioport with the Grateful Dead (who are in all their psychedelic, hippie-cowboy, glory). It looks like they are heading off to the disaster known as 'Altamont'. This is the stuff that makes this box set worth owning. Unfortunately it leaves you wanting more...much more.<br /><br />Physically, this box set is very nice. My hat is off to the graphic designer. It includes an interesting, well written, small hardback book, which fits nicely together with the discs. The audio content is wonderful, but has not been arranged well to the detriment of both the set and the fans. Even though this box set is unnecessarily expensive, it is still worth buying.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|Being a Star Trek fan from the original series onward and sadly having seen the franchise literally ploughed into the ground with extremely weak TV and movie sequels,THIS is the moment I have wished for for a long time.This new Star Trek movie turns the franchise on its' collective ear,infuses it with pure adrenaline and gives us a foundation for the future;without compromising its' roots.<br />The story involves a rogue Romulan by the name of Nero.The head of a former mining vessel,he now has spent years trying to track down Mr.Spock.He blames Spock for destroying the Romulan home world.He has travelled years back and forth in time trying to track him down to meat out his revenge and destroy Vulcan.Eventually he does this by stranding him on a Vulcan moon to watch it.But it is here a young James T.Kirk meets an older Ambassador Spock who explains that the incident that occured to the Romulan homeworld was an unforeseen tragedy.He,in conjunction with the VSA(Vulcan Science Counsel),came up with \\"red matter\\",a substance which would in essence create a black hole and thus envelope the Romulan sun that was going supernova.But the unthinkable happened and Romulus was destroyed.<br />Kirk due to overwhelming circumstances thrust upon him,and seemingly destined to be in the right(or wrong) place at the right time,takes command of the Enterprise and decides to take on the rogue Romulan ship and in the end triumphs magnificently.It also sets in motion the strong bond/friendship that would endure between Kirk and Spock.<br />The movie is jarring for an old Trekker like me and appears to be more so to the umpteen devotee'and hard core Trekkers who have created blog after blog discussing the apparent \\"holes\\" and inconsistencies of this movie.The appearance of a young Chekov(17 yrs.old)is just one of MANY of their bugaboos.As I said this movie turns the franchise on its' ear and in this movie the Romulan threat has resulted in an alternate reality.So the appearance(like Chekov) and deaths of those that we otherwise know to have survived(Spocks' mother) are really not that unbelievable or inconsistent at all with the basic premise of this film.I am looking forward to how they plan to cross the \\"I's\\" and dot the \\"T's\\" in future installments.But above all that,the \\"skinny\\" is,this is Science Fiction and ANYTHING is possible,with an open mind.<br />Leonard Nimoy reprises his original role and who knows who may reappear in future movies...Shatner,Nichols,Takei,Koenig...? The possibilities are endless and wide open.<br />It is the endless possibilities this movie gives us along with the spectacular action and relentless pace,that make it a winner from beginning to end.It also,and VERY importantly,sticks as much as possible to the existing Star Trek cannon(within the context of its' own plotlines) and gives a myriad of nods to the established franchise,both spoken and unspoken.<br />The cast is defintely worth mentioning by name as they all are to be commended with helping to redefine established characters without compromising their essence;that which made them memorable and well known to all Star Trek fans:Chris Pine is the new Kirk,Zachary Quinto is Spock,Karl Urban is Dr.McCoy,Zoe Saldana is Uhura,Simon Pegg does the beloved Scotty,John Cho is Sulu and Anton Yelchin is Chekov.Also Bruce Greenwood gives us Capt.Pike,Ben Cross is Spocks' father and Winona Ryder is Spocks'mother.Some interesting choices,no doubt,but as I said all stay true to the characters established dynamic while inserting their own unique personalities into them.<br />Overall J.J.Abrams has accomplished,in what a relatively short time ago,some thought impossible.I believe he has helped to reinvigorate a franchise that was essentially going nowhere fast;one that has put billions of dollars into the coffers of Paramount and been one of the most successful franchises in entertainment history.And while there will be many detractors,I say good on them and well done for having the vision and guts to see this project to fruition.<br />Technically the DVD transfer is flawless.It is in widescreen and picture in perfect.Special features in this single disc edition include an outtake reel,commentary and a featurette on the \\"new vision\\" this movie takes.<br />The movie has so far grossed about three times its' cost worldwide and the DVD sales are bound to up that figure considerably.It was a blockbuster release for the summer of 2009 and it is just in time for the 2009 Christmas season(when the first Star Trek movies were usually released!)for a gift for that Trekker in your home.It is not the Star Trek of old per se' but it retains the basic canon,values and essence of those characters that all Star Trek fans have come to know and love;with a pacing kicked up several notches packing a nitro-like wallop.You don't have to be a Star Trek fan to like this movie,which is exactly what Abrams and company also had in their smart little minds(attracting NEW converts!),but it sure helps!s project to fruition.

B002KQ6BT6|1.0|This is what everyone was waiting for??  This was the worst written \\"bestseller\\" I have ever attempted to read.  Zero character development, horrendous conversational technique, one dimensional plot development.  I can just see Mr. Brown dreaming of screenplay royalties dancing through his head as he wrote each \\"chapter\\".  This could have been a mildly entertaining short story, but it turned into a dreadful full-length novel with the most disappointing (pointless?) ending imaginable.  You would have expected something more after such a long period since The DaVinci Code, but apparently Mr. Brown rested on his laurels for several years, then woke up one morning and pounded out his next \\"book\\" (screenplay).  Shame on his editor and publisher.
B00006L9ZT|3.0|I video-taped the broadcast of this production the year it was on PBS and have not seen the commercial dvds.  I do have this cycle on cd which is a much better set of performances than you'll see here on film.      I like traditional productions, I also like innovative new 'takes' on these old war horses, though most regietheatre geniuses simply mutilate Wagner's masterpieces to suit their personal vanity.  The only 'modern' version I've liked (and actually purchased) was the Pierre Audi/Hartmut Haenchen cycle from Amsterdam.  Audi does not twist and torture the story into some modern socio-political parable but expresses the mythology of Wagner's vision in a highly creative and visually beautiful and fascinating way.      This Levine/Otto Schenk film is the only 'traditional' production on dvd.  We are currently at the receiving end of an onslaught of trendy, childish mediocrities being poured forth onto film from Europe.  They are all, the Audi being the exception, utter rubbish.  Which is more shameful because some of them feature some fine singing and orchestral/conducting work.    James Levine is not my favorite Wagnerian.  He often lapses into a musical coma and takes his audience with him, his recording of 'Der fliegende Holländer' being a case in point.  I've noted that he always performs with far more energy and insight when working at Bayreuth than he does at the Metropolitan Opera.      The Schenk production is, as one other reviewer said, Blah.  It's as if Schenk had a brilliant vision but couldn't quite realize it in the material world.  The result is like lovely wallpaper.  The direction of the singers seems non-existent and they are left to their own various levels of competence to characterize as best they can.  Few have succeeded in this show.    The pluses:  The orchestra.  They play beautifully, technically perfect and slightly soulless, which is not uncommon with the American way of training musicians.  Technique is ALL and if you are able to convey something deeper, all to the good.  James Morris is a very fine Wotan, though he's better for Sawallisch on the EMI recordings.  But he can't act.  Siegfried Jerusalem is ideal as Loge and stretched as Siegfried, though he's far better than his other filmed counterparts, and he looks great which is a major advantage in a film.      Matti Salminen is one of the two GREAT performers here.  His Hagen is terrifying vocally and histrionically.  A major milestone in recorded Wagner singing.  The other great performer is Ekkehard Wlaschiha's Alberich.  Both these singers take hold of the reins and soar to the greatest heights of dramatic and vocal interpretation.    On a slightly lower but still high level is the ethereal Erda of Birgitta Svendén.  We are lucky Levine cottoned on to this gorgeous voice and we have her beautiful self preserved for posterity.  She is also Barenboim's Erda and First Norn and sings even more gloriously for his filmed version.  Heinz Zednik was always an outstanding Mime and he is at his peak in this cycle.  Kurt Moll is good too but he's hardly on stage long enough to balance the overall mediocrity of the balance of the cast.    I might almost say that the rest of the cast goes for dross, but that wouldn't be entirely true, but almost.  Gary Lakes and Jessye Norman are better heard than seen, though the cd of Walküre were the least successful of the four operas on the DG audio releases.  There is something constipated about that recording that this live action film counteracts simply because people are moving around, even if their movements are stylized and stodgy, as they are here.  And Norman sings much more beautifully on the old Janowski set, with a young, virile Siegfried Jerusalem as Siegmund.  A fine, under-rated Ring cycle recording.    The Gunther and Gutrune are indeed awful.  It's no surprise that no one had ever heard of Hanna Lisowska before and, now, after this production was filmed.  Her Gunther is just as big a non-entity, and I've forgotten his name..   Philip Joll was it?  Who cares?      Freia is okay, Froh and Donner fade into the scenery.  Hildegard Behrens started her career late, singing her first Brünnhilde at Bayreuth for Solti in 1983, she was already mid-40s at the time.  It was a spectacular debut in this role and should be released on cd.  She soon after recorded the part for Sawallisch on EMI, to much better results than she achieves in New York.  I can't stand watching her sing, as her veins and eyeballs are popping out of her head and her voice takes on a constricted, strangled sound that nullifies the great silvery beauty of her top voice.  Her low notes are gutteral, almost barked out.  NOT a good Brünnhilde, I'm afraid.  Recorded too late in her career.  And Christa Ludwig was way beyond her sing-by date.  It seems churlish to diss this great singer for this performance but it was not an advisable way to bow out of her recording career with a vocally vinegary, visually elderly Fricka and Waltraute.    The Valkyries are a typical raucous bunch that only the Met can scrape up (the cd recording valkyries are much better).  The Norns, beside Mignon Dunn's performance, are nothing to write home about either.    All in all, the hoop-la over this film seems unjustified.  But as most people only recognize James Levine and the Metropolitan Opera on the cover they assume it HAS to be great.  Typical provincial jingoism.    We still await an excellent 'traditional' Ring cycle, which I don't think I will see in my lifetime, given the penchant of all those geniuses in Europe to regurgitate their vapid visions onto the stages and screens of the operatic world.    I'd skip this film, and if you are still young, hope for something better in the future.  For now, I highly recommend that, if you are not averse to non-traditional productions, you investigate the Pierre Audi/Hartmut Haenchen cycle.  It is the most successful of the 'modern' productions on film, and though the castisn't perfect there are no vocal land minds and ditches to be encountered like there are in the Levine/Schenk show.
B00000I2PG|4.0|Can I tell you a high school story?  A 1980s story? A music story?<br /><br />Forty year olds like me, who like 60s music and got trashed in high school, have a real bias aginst 1980s bands. I have Cerebal Palsy.<br />I remember hearing Loverboy, Debbie Gibson and the Thriller circus freak himself, Then  I remember  all the football boys and cheerleaders who used to terrorize me. Can you blame me for getting hives when i hear the phrase \\"80s music?\\"<br /><br />I only later found out the 1980s were also host to the Cucteau Twins, Prefab Sprout, Husker Du--all kinds of interesting sounds that never made it to MTV, or more to the point, boom boxes in school lunch rooms. Communications were so localized and small in those days, it was much harder to find out about these types of bands.<br /><br />Now that we have all grown up Duran Duran, Wham and Culture Club are- like boom boxes,  Ronald Reagan and The Cosby  show-part of another lifetime; was that ME?<br /><br />But the music we bypassed is still here, and I can't think of better band than ABC.<br /><br />Lexicon of Love is 100% 1980s. Those drums and shining keybords and synthsized bass are frozen in time. But this music is funky, with operatic chord changes, and lyrics that deal with amore with an adult sophisitcation. This is not the music of jocks but that of spiky haired painters. Listening, you hear shades of Scott Walker, Bacharach, Roxy Music, and all the 1960s romatics, just updated with what was then current irony.<br /><br />All this passed through the ears of angry Beatle boys like me, but now, with lifetimes passed and lifetimes of musical educations I have been privlaged enough to obtain, I hear all the richness and brillance of this music, and realize, this stuff was progressive and royal all along. It was  retro idiots like me who did not get it.<br /><br />Hey, it was a long, long time ago.<br /><br />Plus, it helps that when I go into Starbucks, I am the older quirky guy. The 2009 cheerleaders think I am  cute little dude, kind of a harmless funny uncle, and are REALLY nice to me.REALLY nice to me.
0767812166|5.0|I consider \\"Starman\\" a prize-winning movie, because it was written and produced so well. You can easily put yourself in both of the main characters' shoes.<br /><br />The movie was in great shape when I got it. It came in the right time-frame.
B002QEXN2K|3.0|I've listened to this album a few times and it's growing on me.  However, this album is not near the quality of Continuum which is the best album I have listened to.  Continuum made a connection with my soul and I felt a transfer of feeling from the lyrics and music.  Battle Studios sounds routine and sometimes boring.  I hope that this changes over time but right now I can only rate this at 3 stars.
B000QFBW6K|3.0|Let's face it.  If you're going to spend 15+ hours planted in front of your television set watching Wagner's epic Ring cycle you're going to want some visual pleasures to rest your eyes upon.  You won't find them in Harry Kupfer's production.  This is a most soul crushingly, ugly, depressing and often vapid production as only Harry Kupfer could dream up.      Here you will find his trademarks on full display.  Gods in raincoats, lucite suitcases, malfunctioning lasers, cement time tunnels, low life heroes and heroines and, generally, a depressive Communist Germany viewpoint of the world at large.  At least we are spared his other best known trademark, tv sets scattered all over the floor, though he gives us a sea of antennas in the Norn scene.    He presents us with a world devoid of beauty, nobility and redemption.  Yes, redemption.  Kupfer's vision of Brünnhilde's Immolation does not give humanity a ray of hope, just a repeat of more of the same, rather like the famous nightmare film 'Dead of Night'.  Humanity is doomed to reiterate the same debâcles over and over ad infinitum.  I don't think this is what Wagner had in mind. But that isn't important.  What matters is that the granddaddy of regietheater has splashed his nihilistic vision, once again, all over the screen for our supposed edification and has spawned and encouraged the army of wunderkind regietheatremaniacs who seem determined to destroy all that is good and great in their quest to make their mark on opera production history textbooks.  They are self-ordained educators to the idiot masses and if you don't like what they are doing you are labeled a reactionary philistine.      Thanks, Harry.  The spirit of Ruth Berghaus is now extinct.    I don't mind being edified if the professor is truly interested in the advancement of my soul but not when he is more-or-less spitting in my face, which is what I feel has happened when I watch these operas from Bayreuth.  And it's getting worse on the Green Hill, note the new 'M'singer' and 'Tristan' and, too a lesser degree Herheim's 'Parsifal' which the trendies so adored when it premiered in 2008.      I like modern interpretations of Wagner, in fact, I prefer them over things like the Schenk/Levine production from the Met.  But the only filmed version of the Ring in modern dress that I have found continuous and repeated pleasure in is the Pierre Audi/Harmut Haenchen cycle from Amsterdam.  It's marvellous and way off the map in terms of inventiveness and imagination.    This diss of Kupfer is all the more saddening because Barenboim is an excellent Wagnerian who excels at the late masterpieces, like the Ring, Tristan and Parsifal.  And he has at his command the magnificent Bayreuth Orchestra and even more astounding Bayreuth chorus.  Is there a better chorus on earth in this repertory? No, not the hammy ragtag wobblers and bleaters at The Met, sorry.    His soloists are, generally, excellent, a few misfires notwithstanding.  None of these singers are what I consider to be the 'best' in their roles, with the exception of Birgitta Svendén's marvellous Erda, but they are all top drawer and memorable.    John Tomlinson was, in the early days, the finest Hunding/Hagen I'd seen in the opera house, then he moved into Wotan/Hans Sachs territory and was less successful, though still formidable and not to be dismissed out of hand.  His voice is very dark and gravelly, but highly expressive.  Where he meets his limits is at the top of the range, notably the second scene of Rheingold and the end of Walküre.  He is stretched almost to cracking point, but he gets through because he knows his own instrument so well and commands complete control of his resources.  He never disappoints, so is a major plus in this film.  Günter von Kannen's Alberich is also very compelling.  He's a little wobbly but his is a powerful, menacing performance, and he's a great actor, like Tomlinson.      I like Nadine Secunde and Poul Elming as the twins, Sieglinde and Siegmund.  I suppose they can be likened to French resistance fighters, given their battle-gear and head scarves etc.  Within this context these two excellent performers create a vivid frisson of thwarted passion and tragedy.  And they are both very good looking people into the bargain, which is always an advantage in filmed opera.  Certainly they are far more plausible than were Gary Lakes and Jessye Norman for Levine's cycle.  Matthias Hölle is an unusually handsome and suave Hunding, which I think is preferable to his being some hairy, filthy operatic Fred Flintstone.  He's almost as seductive sounding as the late, great Gottlob Frick in this part.    Anne Evans is a lovely Brünnhilde with a beautiful voice, but it's one size too small for Brünnhilde.  Fortunately she marshalls her resources and doesn't do any damage to her vocal chords, and she is a decent actress. But I prefer Gwyneth Jones' wild, balls to the wall performance for Boulez.    Siegfried Jerusalem is on better form for Barenboim than he was for Levine.  And he looks very sexy, all sweaty with messy hair.  He's far too neat and clean in Otto Schenk's production.      Graham Clark's Loge and 'Siegfried' Mime are famous and need no recommending.  But don't miss him as Mime The Fly in the Audi production of 'Siegfried', it is unforgettable!  Waltraud Meier is her usual high octane self as Waltraute in Götterdämmerung.  The voice was, and always has been, slightly vinegary.  But as this isn't Isolde or Sieglinde the strained top notes are not in evidence and she turns in one of the better Waltrautes on record and film.  And she is SO beautiful and such a great actress.    The minor gods, Freia, Froh and Donner are rather outstanding as far as these three small parts go.  Eva Johansson is one of the few non-screamers who've performed Freia, though she's a bit bug-eyed she's quite lovely.  And Kurt Schreibmayer seems the perfect embodiment of an Adonis-like Froh, and he sings very well indeed.  Bodo Brinkmann is less attractive, both vocally and physically, but his brutal voice suits Donner and he acts very well as Gunther.  Eva-Maria Bundschuh made a career of performing Gutrune and this is her best outing in the part.    The rest of Barenboim's cast is adequate, though why Uta Priew, a low mezzo, was assigned the part of the Third Norn, a dramatic soprano role, is utterly baffling.  Surely one of the other Valkyrie singers, like Eva Johansson or Ruth Floeren would have been more vocally comfortable and effective in this part.  Philip Kang is a bit of a washout as Fafner and Hagen, his voice being too soft grained and inexpressive.  This is too bad because his lack of vocal charisma has a muting effect on 'Götterdämmerung'.    The Rhine Maidens get lost in the flickering laser lights in Rheingold so one hardly notices how they're singing.  Jane Turner is especially good as Floßhilde.  They are better tuned in 'Götterdämmerung' however as they don't have any of Kupfer's technical debâcles to contend with.    So, buy it?  No.  Get the audio recordings if you can still find them.  I expect Amazon can scrounge up the original Teldec sets, they are worth looking for.  But the Kupfer production was not worth preserving on film.  If it's a modern version of these operas you seek get the Audi/Haenchen set, I can't say it enough times.  With Audi the spirit of true imaginative insight married to visual beauty possessed by the late, great Ruth Berghaus lives again.
0385504225|1.0|I didn't realize how shallow the concept or how overexposed I was to  mysticism in a novel till I read this utterly far fetched and frankly dull book.

B002LCOQVO|5.0|As physical CD sales continue to slide and slide, bands are wisely (and belatedly) putting out remastered editions of their albums.  And for the most part, they are welcome.  Yes, many fans are buying the same items again, but we also know that so many albums released on CD were never properly remastered for the format.<br /><br />I'm not the world's biggest or best audiophile, so I cannot produce an in-depth analysis of all the EQ level differences and how the versions compare bit-by-bit (or byte-by-byte) and how much this or that was done to these tracks.  In general, I do find most remasters to be worth the money.  The biggest difference between 'old' and 'new' CDs is the extra 'punch' that remasters usually bring out.  That punch can bigger and better bass, and more clarity.  Basically, the old CDs did sound 'flatter', with all of the instruments and sounds on one level (right in the middle).  The remasters bring everything out, make the instruments and tones really stand out, give the bass and the beats a lot more kick, and give everything a crisper sound.  In many cases, and this album is an example, the volume may be louder, too.  (This is especially the case on the recent Beatles remasters.)<br /><br />I would encourage folks to read some independent reviews of the remasters, and to get some perspective from some of the truly obsessed folks who can and have produced extremely detailed breakdowns of the remastering job.  From what I've read, the effects tends to differ from album to album.  For 'licensing reasons', only four of the remastered albums appear to be available in the USA as separate discs (Autobahn, Radioactivity, Trans Europe Express, and The Man Machine).  Criminally, Computer World will not be available as a separate offering, so one may have to spring for the box set (Katalogue), or just contribute to declining sales and go and steal the album.  Also, not sure if the German versions will be available at all in the USA, except as super pricey imports (the German Katalogue is import-only and almost triple the price of the English versions).<br /><br />The album?  Yes, it's been considered a classic for years, and yes, it gets one five-star review after another on both sides of the Atlantic.<br /><br />Highly recommended album, this legendary offering sounds great, and continues to impress new fans as perhaps the crowning achievement of 'the electronic Beatles'.rman Katalogue is import-only and almost triple the price of the English versions).

B001AVCFK6|5.0|This movie has an original Star Trek feel to it.  Good story.  Actors are fantastic.  They were very much in character with the originals....impressive.  Didn't care for the Scotty in the water tube scenes.  They were silly and out of place.    Loved seeing Leonard Nimoy.  Only thing missing is WILLIAM SHANTER!!!!  He should have been in this movie...they could have found a way to fit him in.  As I see it, a big mistake.   I'm ready for the next one.
0743298039|5.0|A bit slow to engage me initially, but got me hooked as a cant-put-down book by mid-way. The whole book drips with homages to past writers, especially Charlotte Bronte. A mystery with the theme of twins, and dysfunctional families, there are plenty of clues but the one ambiguous twist is who survives the fire.
B00168OIOE|5.0|Awesome upgrade to Bluray. Monster's Inc. looks and sounds amazing. 90% of the special features are all still in standard def, but just happy they are on there.<br />Definitely worth the upgrade if your a Pixar fan
B002T921AC|4.0|This CD has a number of catchy songs in its seven cuts and for the most part is fine for the intended audience of young listeners--but for some reason the teen artist feels he needs to push the limit a bit with some suggestive lyrics.  \\"Love Me\\" is possibly the best song on the CD but it is very adult--he took a previously recorded hook and changed the words to actually make it more adult, including \\"Oh how you do me.\\"  There's also the slow dance song \\"First Dance\\" (featuring Usher) that is just plain too seductive for little girls (and includes an anti-parent lyric).  Best idea for parents of younger kids is to buy the individual cuts of \\"One Time,\\" \\"Favorite Girl,\\" and \\"One Less Lonely Girl.\\"  It's a little sad that a good singer like Bieber has to do grownup lyrics when he is just a kid who thanks Jesus on his liner notes.  Like Britney, Hilary Duff and now Miley, there seems to be a need for young pop stars to have adult lyrics to draw a broad audience, but it would be nice if for once an entire CD was clean enough for parents to not have to cringe in parts.  This is certainly no Justin Timberlake CD, but you can tell he is headed in that direction.
0385504225|4.0|Fun to read, exciting for 80% of the book, but last 20% gets rather tiresome and boring.  But, all in all, it was fun to read... just don't expect that it will end strong.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|I just listened to this full CD on AOL Music and I love this CD. I have always been a fan of John Mayer's voice, but have never purchased any of his music to this date except for a few downloads for my I-pod. This CD is awesome, the lyrics tug at your heart and make you feel the turmoil and pain he may be feeling in his personal life. I am always looking for music to just \\"chill\\" to , and this CD delivers just that. I will be purchasing this cd for my music collection, and looking into more of John's past work to add to it.

B001OQCV24|3.0|There is no way that anyone should be giving this movie more than 3 stars... even that is pushing it.  The acting was average, the script/dialog below average and the plausibility of everything happening the way the movie states it will is far fetched.  I found it odd that so many first rate actors signed on to make such a silly film... perhaps Bernie Madoff took them to the cleaners and now they need to refill their coffers?? The special effects were excellent, but I would expect no less from any well funded film coming out in this day and age.<br /><br />Another oddity is that I didn't feel much for the people in the film.  There was so much action that no one bothered to develop the characters so the audience could bond with them.  I cared just a little bit as to whether or not the main characters lived or died.  This had no where near the grace, bonding or depth of story that \\"Deep Impact\\" or \\"Knowing\\" had.  Also, what was up with all the wealthy people getting to live and the rest of us perishing???  How awful is that?! (lol)<br /><br />This is fun, mindless entertainment to go see in the middle of the week during the day so you can pay matinee prices.  That's about it.

0195117298|2.0|I read this book when it first came out, and I just finished reading it a second time.  With any difficult subject you keep tabs of the arguments as best you can, hoping that by the end the pieces fall into place for you. And even if they don't you still hope to find out how it can be expected to influence the subject it covers.  Sadly, neither of these came to pass.  The author's \\"time capsules\\" seem to describe snapshots of the universe in absolute time, but they include not just what we would call our actual universe but any possible configuration of the universe.  We experience the most probable of these time capsules.  But if time is an illusion what does it matter to us?  What changes?  What insight does it provide?  The book may have been better off if it were written in a more technical manner for experts or with more analogies and descriptions for lay readers.
B001QERPDO|5.0|This CD rocks.  The sound varies from hip hoppish to slow ballads.  I heard \\"The Man...Moved\\" on VH-1 and decided to download some songs.  Loved the songs so I bought the CD.  I hope The Script continues to bring more new and innovative music to the air because I am a fan.

B002MU4NL8|2.0|This is a pretty good movie, but what's the deal with the stupid Thermian Audio Track?!  Yeah, that makes sense -- let's waste disc space with a moronic audio track only a few supergeeks will listen to for about 5 minutes before it even gets on THEIR supernerd nerves.  We certainly wouldn't want to include a French or Portuguese language track.  You know, a REAL language.  That wouldn't make sense!  Then we'd probably sells thousands of more blu-rays to people who don't understand English or the dubbed Spanish track or (wait for it... wait for it...!) THERMIAN!<br /><br />Stoopid.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|Surely everyone can't be a music critic.  For all that are disappointed, to each it's own.  I on the other hand LOVE this CD. John Mayer is one of the best musicians/songwriters ever born.  His voice is beautiful and his songs certainly do touch on every human emotion.  I have every album that he has put out and my appreciation for his talent continues to grow.  I love when artisits test thier artistic abilities; and while this album isn't Contiuum (which is my favorite by far), it still is a great album.  The man can sing the alphabet for all I care and I would give him 5 stars...:-)      Can't wait for the next one to drop.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|This is such a great flick with an awesome ensemble cast... Hugh Grant, Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson, Kiera Knightly, etc.  The best part about it to me is that it isn't your run of the mill, boy meets girl, they fall in love and live happily ever after romantic comedy.  There are several different stories going on over the course of the movie, and though they're all intertwined, they don't all have a happy ending.  Quite possibly the best part is watching a middle-aged Hugh Grant shake his booty to some 80s pop song, or sing Christmas carols to little girls in tiaras.  Oh, and there's also great music.  Watch it, you'll love it.
B00275EGX8|1.0|I am an Army EOD Technician and I took great offense to how we were portrayed in this movie.  I have operational experience in Bosnia and Afghanistan.  If I ever had an EOD team leader like SFC James I would have made it my mission in life to see that he was removed from the EOD program amd reduced in rank.  Blatant disregard for safety and procedures will get you and your men killed very quickly.  Let's not even discuss the rediculous scenarios that these characters seemed to continually find themselves thrust into.  Never would a lone EOD team venture into the field without some sort of security element or at least another EOD team truck to provide cover and assistance in the event of hostile action.  I was actually angry during the entire length of this movie.  EOD Technicians are some of the most highly trained military personnel in service and it was absolutely disrespectful to see them portrayed this way.  I think that all military members should avoid this movie.  I'd like to know who the military advisor to the film was so I could give them a piece of my mind too.  THIS MOVIE SUCKS!

B002Q8GZ62|5.0|That Spandau Ballet have managed to reform and remain afloat was exciting enough for me but this new release was a totally unexpected treat.  They breathe brand new life into songs that were classic to begin with and have elevated them smack into the present.  Tony Hadley's voice has never sounded better.  New arrangements of classics such as True, Chant No.1, Through the Barricades, and She Loved Like Diamond really bowled me over.  I have had this CD in my car for over two weeks now and I have listened to it over and over and every day it's like a brand new CD. When I hear Tony hold that one note for a full eight bars in To Cut a Long Story Short, I realize what an astonishing instrument the voice really is and what a talent he really has for using it.  As a musician, I am inspired to the highest when I hear these songs and this new release by SB really proves that the band still has the power to rock.

031237674X|5.0|I highly recommend this book over any other book on the subject of past lives. Dr. Tucker, who has taken over the practice since the passing of his predecessor Dr. Ian Stevenson began this project, researches and studies subjects using a scientific approach, which few others do such as Carol Bowman, at least she never mentions any in her book but instead just accepts people's claims. Dr. Stevenson's work was brilliant but this book removes the rather dry scientific case study approach and makes it more readable. What makes Tucker's stories amazing is the subjects are children between the ages of about 4 - 7 who remember previous lives that are verifiable because often the previous persons died shortly before these children were born. The studies take these children to villages or to families of the deceased to verify or \\"solve\\" the question of whether this person really is the deceased person incarnate. The stories will astound you and have you convinced that we've most likely all been here before and will no doubt be here again.
0316069906|1.0|I purchased this book for my wife, but she is still reading her last book, so I thought I would try reading this in order to open my mind to other ideas. I couldn't get past page 50....    See, the author says \\"This is not an argument against eating meat\\" when it clearly is.   The example that threw me over the edge is when he tried to have the reader try to imagine what it's like for an egg laying chicken in an exceedingly small enclosure. This was a not so subtle attempt by the author of trying to project human emotion on to an animal that does not experience that feeling. Does anyone truly think a Chicken feels lonely or claustrophobic? How about a fish... think a fish gets lonely? Now I know from my own personal experience that some animals to have these complex emotions. Coming home to my dog I know in my heart he missed me. THAT DOES NOT MEAN A CHICKEN FEELS THOSE EMOTIONS AS WELL!    Also has anyone seen what it is like for a water buffalo in Africa when a group of lions take one out? I would imagine that being eaten alive must be an unpleasant experience. If we were to use the authors logic then we should stop all predatory animals from trying to commit genocide on there prey, but hat would be ludicrous wouldn't it? We are predators, not prey, if we should be empathizing with other animals then it should be with other predators.    So considering I did not read the whole book I suppose my opinion is not as important as someone who read the whole book. It's just the act of projecting complex human emotions on some animals I found so illogical... it's like it broke my mind. I could not continue reading something from someone who held such beliefs.

B001FXCE46|4.0|A darling of indie rock for much of this decade, including finding a prominent place on the soundtrack for Disturbia, Kings of Leon is not anything new. What is new however is their sound for this effort. While their previous albums were a bit on the more abstract indie side, this ventures into area rock mode, and it works quite well for the band, showing their a force to be reckoned with in the future, all the while providing some killer rock tracks.<br /><br />Highlights Include:<br />Crawl<br />Sex On Fire<br />Manhattan<br />Notion<br />Use Somebody<br /><br />This album is best looked at as a whole by comparing its first two songs. 'Closer' is a track that seems like it's trying to achieve something, but rather bubbles in mediocrity the whole way through. It may not be a bad song, but it's not a good one either, and unfortunately the album sort of revels in this type of song where the destination is unknown, and instead you just get lost in the desert. Granted, none of these songs are exactly approachable, and many of them take a few listens before you come around to them, but still.<br /><br />Then there's songs like 'Crawl,' which are just killer rock tracks, demonstrated by this track especially. It's guitar work is simply incredible, and KOL achieves the mood of the song perfectly. Be sure of this, when something works on this album, they seem to hit it out of the park, as they do with \\"Sex On Fire.\\" It's kind of obscene, and its music video is downright weird, but the delivery is just so good that it's kind of irresistible. In the category of one of the most unexpected smash hits of the year, 'Use Somebody' is pure arena anthemic rock, and it achieves it with lighters in hand and all. It's chorus may leave something to be desired, but it's still a great song.<br /><br />One of the keys to what makes Kings of Leon so good is Nathan Followill's vocals. Song after song is just a great performance by Followill, and it seals the deal and simply makes the album. In fact, while the comparison is overused, you could compare the vocal style to a belting Bono if he'd grown up in Kentucky. It's simply brilliant at times, and it's quite a unique joy to listen to.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Only By The Night\\" is a mostly solid rock record that highs are real high, and its lows are frustratingly middling. The future of modern rock? Maybe. They certainly have the building blocks for something truly good here. But for now, lows aside, this album hits on some truly spectacular rock moments and its at least worth a listen.d compare the vocal style to a belting Bono if he'd grown up in Kentucky.

B002HWRZH0|2.0|To Start this is not a review on the BluRay Disc itself or the movie as a whole. I saw Star Trek in theaters 5 times, so obviously... I like the movie. I pre-ordered this set the day it went online since it looked to be by far the best Set of all the available special editions. But after getting it I feel pretty down about the money I spent on it.     My first issue is the box, for starters, in the pictures it looks like a nice display quality box, maybe plastic or possibly Tin. But in reality it is corrugated cardboard, the Enterprise toy from playmates has a nicer quality box. I know that it is corrugated cardboard as the ribbing shows through on the surface and has rubbing wear making the peaks of the corrugation look more worn than the valleys. Basically the copy I got looks nothing like the solid black box in the image.    My second issue was the Bluray itself, Which is just the standard bluray available on amazon for $19. no matching cover to the box nothing special.    The Replica is cool, feels really solid and has an overall good weight and feel. the detail and scale is pretty nice as well. Is it worth the additional $70? To that I can honestly give a flat out NO.    In the end I really wish I had not opened the box to begin with and returned it as soon as I saw the quality of the packaging. If your on the fence about this I would say save your money, there are a lot of other versions out there, all of them for $60 less.
B0007PLLQ0|5.0|Together with the Dark Crystal and the Dragonslayer the best fantasy-movie I have ever seen. I don't like that much modern computeranimated special effects. I like more... handmade stuff like this. Only the end is a bit lame. The masks and the ambience are awesome. The 80's marked the zenith in many ways of popular culture. This is one in film.
B001DHXT6G|4.0|Purchased these DVD's first time at the beginning of Nov 2009. A few of the first and second season were unplayable on my DVD player and on my computer DVD player. The third season played fine. I sent them back and they sent me another set. Same thing happened. I bought a NEW DVD player and tried it again. No dice. Something is wrong with the DVD's as shipped from Las Vegas. Also the cases were scratched and some of the DVD's were scratched as if they repacked them and resold. Very unprofessional and very disappointing. I loved the new special remastered effects though on the ones I could play.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|I'm going to try to keep this short. 500 days of summer is the best film I've seen in 2009. It describes the modern loverboy very well. In a character's vulnerability, I saw mine. I would recommend this to everyone who's looking to definitely skip this film because of what their friends said. This is even better than the Hangover. Yes, it is that acceptable. A very good, if not brilliant soundtrack and a thoroughly good use of fiction with fantastic editing making the film seem neither too long nor too short. I also think it was flawless, yes and I've made atleast a dozen people watch it so far.
B0009P66TK|2.0|This is going back!!  Amazon shows the side of the watch with the crown but not the side with **INVICTA engraved in big letters**. Ugly.    Foolishly I bought this watch after reading the measurements and that it is a bigger watch but it's HUGE. I think I have an average size wrist and this thing looks ridiculous on it. I wanted to see how it compared to my other watches and I drew out the dimensions on paper and it didn't look nearly as big as it is. I think the size of it makes it look like cheap toy and that's just my opinion but be warned it's probably BIGGER than you think if you aren't familiar with the brand.
0439023491|3.0|The things about \\"Catching Fire\\" that I have to keep reminding myself of is that it's not written for adults. The idea and general plot structure is stellar and highly entertaining, but the execution often falls flat in places--mainly because I feel the book knows it is geared for teenagers and thus doesn't have to try. I would love to see this book give its readers a little credit (ala, that teens can handle more complex writing and ideas), because there are times where things are so rushed. The entire first third of the book drags until we get to the Victory Tour (which I was looking forward to reading about) but the next thing I know, we're zooming through the entire thing over the course of a couple of pages. I would have loved to read about Peeta's fake proposal in front of the Capitol in detail--given that the love triangle plot point is something that seems to be anchoring the story--but instead I'm given a few lines telling me it happened. It isn't until we're told about the rules of the Quarterly Quell that the book takes on a shadow of \\"The Hunger Games\\".<br /><br />Speaking of the love triangle, it too falls a bit flat--if only because I cannot see why I should be rooting for Gale in it. He's not given enough background for the reader to really understand Katniss's feelings for him. In fact, his character is more of Katniss telling us about him rather than what Gale is showing us. I suppose that I'm supposed to take her word for it, but when you've got Saint Peeta running around (who is a little too pure and perfect for my tastes, but I'll let that slide because in general I think he's alright) showing you everything he's got, it's hard to wonder why a triangle exists.<br /><br />Overall, the book was okay. I enjoyed the introduction of characters like Finnick and Joanna, and I enjoyed a chance to go back into the arena with Katniss. What it comes down to is that I read \\"The Hunger Games\\" in a matter of hours, but this one I took my time with because it just didn't grab me like \\"THG\\" did. I still contest that if this book gave its readers some credit--if it pushed the envelope a bit more and really explored some of the emotions running through Katniss's head and really delved into the political disarray, instead of just breezing over them with general summaries--it would be completely fantastic.ust didn't grab me like \\"THG\\" did.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|Let me start off by saying I still watch Star Trek everyday....The \\"original series\\" and \\"the Next Generation\\"....anything after that I have never watched and never will.  This movie caught the true spirit of those two series perfectly. I won't go into any details because thats been done by at great length and detail by many of you already. I just want to say I loved this movie and will enjoy watching it over and over for many years to come.  To bad we all grow old....I wish the original cast members could still be making the series and movies today....no one could ever replace those original actors and actresses but they sure did do a great job with picking some new ones.  I can't wait for the next Star Trek movie to come out.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I went to see the film with my family and after it was over we just sat there. On the one hand we all felt so sorry that Michael Jackson, who was so talented and kind, died so early and so needlessly. And, second, I think we wanted more.<br />You cannot watch this film and not marvel at the talent displayed not only by Michael Jackson but the extremely talented support staff of musicians and dancers.<br />The film shows Michael tenderly trying to tweak his upcoming concert to prefection without making anyone feel that he was being bossy. He always stressed that everything he did was with love.<br />The other thing we all realized was that Michael was 50 years old. I am sure that most of the people dancing with him were half his age or younger. That alone is amazing. And he had an ultra-talented female lead guitarist who was excellent.<br />The movie is absorbing and well worth seeing. I will be the first person in town to buy the DVD. My highest personal recommendation and that of my entire family.
0385340990|5.0|This book is a fun read.It is very well written. I could not put it down, and immediately ordered it for my sister. The subjects lived through hardships we can only imagine. That story is told, but there is much humor. The characters are all fascinating people.  I felt sad that there will be no sequel.
1401323820|4.0|I love \\"Castle\\" and initially bought the book to support the show; however, \\"Heat Wave\\" turned out to be a really fun read...I could imagine Castle and Beckett in their various \\"aliases\\" in the book and it was like watching another episode. Great marketing, too!  The book read really fast: next time I'd like to have a full-sized novel.  I wholeheartedly recommend it to fans of the show--and anyone who likes a little mystery and humor!
0385504225|1.0|This is a 100 page story condensed to 500 pages. Everyone is willing to do whatever it takes to find a secret that no one knows. There is a puzzle that reveals nothing and a great truth that reveals nothing. There is science that bears no resemblance to real science that spouts drivel as facts. This was my first Dan Brown novel and unless I have a lobotomy, it was my last.
B002JTHFUS|4.0|This is my first review on Amazon.      I have been a very big fan of U2 for a very long time.  I have really liked just about all of their music.  I have really enjoyed the remastering, having all the extra b-sides, remixes, and videos.  They all have been done very well and have included some really rare gems.    Okay.  Here's the one thing that would have made this even better, 5.1 mix of the album.  I know people will argue that they don't have a dvd-a or sacd player.  Not true.  Most newer dvd players will play either one or both formats.  The Unforgettable Fire is one of my favorite albums.  This album mixed in 5.1 would be unbelievable!  Once you have heard a good 5.1 mix of a studio album, it's hard to go back to the original.    I would gladly pay more if these U2 remasters were available in 5.1.    Just my two cents.
0740785508|5.0|I should start by saying that I am neither an artist nor a student of the arts. I am simply someone who enjoys fantasy imagery and characters to the point where I will purchase \\"How to\\" books to dabble with drawing and digital paint type programs. I had no real expectations with his book, except maybe just another step-by-step approach to some of the images shown. This book is a great deal more than that. It is not at all useful really for a quick here's a dragon, here's how to draw and color that dragon approach, but it offers a certain depth that ranges from not only setting up a proper studio but delves into things like taking inspiration from simply viewing others and has a certain charm in the language, obviously from the author's personality.     For a paperback, this book is real quality material. The pages are thick, the colored images are rich and vibrant, lacking that sort of washed out or quickly thrown together feel other similar books might have. The various sections in the book flow together in a way that actually makes it an enjoyable read just to get an insight into an artist's approach to his craft. The kind of stuff covered in this book is well beyond me, but what is provided is rather remarkable, and I know even as an amateur is going to pick up a few things to dabble with right away. He talks about nature as we know it and applying to rather unnatural or fantasy creatures in way that makes them believable. I am also a fan of fantasy literature and movies, and I sometime wonder how different some of the movies I have disliked in the genre might have been better if they took this sort of here is how to make it fit, make it natural approach instead of throwing out some of the unbelievable \\"animals\\" I have ever seen. I should also mention I almost never, ever read books that use a 1st person point-of-view, but again in this case, the way the he talks about his experiences, his thought process to the actual end product was interesting to the point where I enjoyed his perspective thoroughly.    I can't say if this is the kind of thing that a true student or artist would appreciate or not. And even though it is not a quick, here you go follow these steps to create one image book, again there is so much information provided here in a digestible, not a textbook type feel, that you're going to walk away with some sort of insight that will be useful for your own work or help you appreciate the process even more than you already do.
B000001DQI|5.0|This album is perfect from the opening synth sweep to the closing ballad and is a truly deserving five-star album. There is not a dud track and the best songs are the ones you don't hear very often. This album saw the boys at their creative peaks. To just rip songs like this out with endless confidence must be so rewarding. A personal favourite no doubt, and the DVD-Audio version contains three bonus tracks that are also just magnificent. I could never tire of GYBR. Thankfully it's a double album. So much quality crammed into such as a small time frame. Love it, love it, love it.
0006165400|4.0|Although I did no received the book I requested, they gave me back the money I paid as they could not send me it.<br />I really appreciate the quick response by them to face and solve the situation.
0307454541|4.0|TGWTDT is, as one would hope, a fast and entertaining read, chock-full of suspense and unexpected twists.  It is a thoughtful procedural with a well-developed -- and, for the most part, credible -- plot-line, and solid characters.  I am rarely moved to read books straight through (I generally prefer dipping into several at a time).  TGWTDT had me hooked from start to finish.  One star docked for some instances of unnecessary sensationalism and a few less-than-fully-credible plot devices.  Though I did roll my eyes from time to time as I read TGWTDT, for the most part I found it absorbing.  Given the subject matter at the core of Larsson's novels, I'm not sure I 'look forward' to reading his other two, exactly, but I do plan on reading them for sure.
B0013FNC38|5.0|This guy is amazing, saw him on Farm Aid and immediately bought his CD. I was not disappointed.Extreme talent is not an overstatement.
B001FB55I0|2.0|If you love the Terminator franchise...well, you'd HAVE to love it to endure this mess.  The first two flicks were awesome, of course.  The third?  Not so much.  T4?  The downward spiral continues.  Huge budget, talented actors and great story material are all majestically pissed away.  The Charlie's Angels films were light and fun but McG needed to introduce a bunch of peripheral characters that would have been fine in another film but who cares?  I didn't and that was the problem.  Bryce Howard gets to walk around with big eyes.  Christian Bale gets to play in some over-the-top effects sequences.  Sam Worthington and Moon Bloodgood(sp?) get to have a romance and why do we need this or care?  All of these people are extremely talented and again, the effects?  More or less spectacular.  But I found myself apathetic.  In the earlier films you found a stake in the characters and cared.  With T4 I felt like I was watching a play by Max Fisher.  Well done but just not the real deal.
0307473708|4.0|What I like best not only about this book but also the series is the way the internalization is handled.  While Dexter is extremely dark, he is also very funny, which, considering the subject matter at hand, is a really good thing.
B002HWRYJE|3.0|I just finished watching this movie. For a long time I have been an avid Star Trek fan and have seen all the major motion pictures. This movie is an attempt to remake the franchise for more modern action-oriented audiences. Consequently, there isn't much of a plot here. The whole notion of a rogue Romulon from the future seems entirely wasted. The script is either poorly written or poorly acted.     What could have been a great movie turns out to be a mediocre one at best. Further, the actor who plays Spock (the same one who plays Sylar on Heroes) does not do a credible job. Part of this isn't the actor's fault--I just kept anticipating him to throw people across the bridge with just a gesture of his hand--but neither was he convincing in the role. The actor who played Kirk did an excellent job. Ohura was miscast.     When the closing credits came, I felt that all we saw was dazzling special effects without any real or lasting substance. Poor job, J.J.

B002H3F7F6|3.0|I recieved Sting'S new album very quickly. Most of the songs on the CD are traditional songs from NewCastle and celtic songs from the United Kingdom. An intersting song on the cd is \\"Soul Cake\\". It is about begging for food to appease the dead as they walk the earth on Christmas.There are many songs about roses and snow. \\"A Cherry Tree Carol\\" is an intersting song that may offend christians because Jesus' earthly father Joseph is portrayed as being angry with the blessed mother and tells her to have God get her cherries from the garden because he is the father of her child. Other than that song, most of the songs are nice and relaxing songs to listen to at a house party or alone during the holidays. The CD and DVD package is $10 more and something realy true fans of sting would enjoy.Otherwise, the CD is enough for most people.
B002NOAF9W|2.0|Several other reviewers have already given accuate reviews of the numerous shortcomings of this pathetic effort to squeeze your dollars from your wallet. The only worthwhile disc and reason for 2 stars, instead of the well deserved single, were the blues covers from BB King and Tina/Ike. Save your money!
B000002QWD|5.0|This CD has all the Bing Crosby classics, including one with the Andrews Sisters. Puts you right in the holiday spirit.
B002IYEQR4|5.0|This is a Thank you to Snyder, WB for releasing the definitive, uncut movie of Watchmen. Yes, granted we got the Director's cut back in July, but this is the icing on the cake, the happy ending, winning TD, the creme de la creme of Director Cut movies. Even though we have to shell out some $$, Yaaaaahhh Capitalism.<br /><br />The movie is nicely packaged and comes with the complete animated motion comic DVD. Now most will say why get this? Why drop like 30 something bucks? In a economy crisis we're in? Why just get the director's cut, the Tales of the Black Freighter, separately? I think this Cut with the Tales of the Black freighter, interwoven in gives the story more depth, more \\"meat\\" to this movie, as in the comic itself there is so much that is going on, so much layering in story, characters, you just do not get that if you buy TOBF and Watchmen Regular Director's Cut, doesn't feel whole... as this, with the Ultimate Cut, it feels whole even though longer but feels totally in sync with the graphic novel itself. I have not yet watched it with Commentary with Snyder and co writer Dave Gibbons which I think will be very interesting, get an intimate insight from one of today's most visionary directors.<br /><br />Over all very pleased with this edition, nearly flawless, as great as Dark Knight Blu Ray I have to say.
0312330537|5.0|I read a lot of books that I like.  We all enjoy certain authors, certain genres.  But to put it out there Gregory David Roberts's roman a clef SHANTARAM is you of the best novels I have read in years, a wonderful, intricate story.  Don't be scared off that it is a large work or set in India, well, that scared me at first.<br /><br />The story is detailed and the characters are wonderfully written and introduced.  The author writes to allow you to see the characters through his pen.  Early in the book his paragraph description of Didier Levy is so good.  For that matter the opening lines of the book hook you.  The story is about Lin, the escapee to Bombay but the other people are colorful and marvelous, Karla Saaranen, Abdel Khader Khan, Johnny Cigar, Madame Zhou, and of course Prabaker, among so many others.<br /><br />Read this book.  It is a joy. There is a reason why Johnny Depp is involved with the movie coming out.
0316017922|3.0|Gladwell has taken what would be a few ordinary blog posts and added enough eloquent fluff to them to make them into a book. There is probably a good deal of truth to his conclusions, but the evidence is much weaker than he wants you to think.<br /><br />For his claim that 10,000 hours of practice are needed to become an expert, he doesn't discuss the possibility that the causality often runs the opposite way: having the talent to become an expert creates a desire to practice a lot. He gives at least one example where the person seemed to lack expertise before getting the 10,000 hours of practice, but it's not hard to imagine a variety of immaturity-related reasons why that might happen without the amount of practice causing the expertise.<br /><br />I'm confused by his claims about how much practice he thinks the Beatles had before becoming successful. He points to somewhere between 1,200 and 1,800 hours of practice they had by late 1962 (which is about when Wikipedia indicates they became successful in the UK). Gladwell seems to say they weren't successful until they came to the US in February 1964. He implies that they had 10,000 hours of practice by then, but I don't see how he could claim they had much more than 3,000 hours of practice by then. So calling the 10,000 hour estimate a rule appears involve a good deal of exaggeration.

079284131X|5.0|when i first watched this movie I had nightmares of my stuffed animals coming to life lol (I was young) but its a fun movie, its more suspense than horror. I dont like many \\"horror\\" movies but Child's play is entertaining, chucky's laugh, the way he runs, is hilarious For an old movie this is pretty dran good :)
B001AVCFK6|1.0|I haven't seen one complete episode of the original show which in fact gave me the opportunity of viewing it without any influences as to how it should or shouldn't have been portrayed.      Wow!  What a waste of space and time.  This over hyped nightmare was simply God awful. This ended up being worse than Battlefield Earth but without the Travolta.  The only good thing about this flick was, that I rented it and saved monies by not buying the thing.    What gives with you people that ranted and raved about how good of a film this was?  Give me a break, it was terrible.  Had John Travolta been given a second chance and consequently played the role of Spock, Mike Myers as Scottie and Jim Carrey playing the part of Uhura, this would have been a huge blockbuster hit.

0810983915|5.0|My 11 year old son could not put this book down until he had completed every page.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|So I just got watching Martyrs and I came to Amazon to give my seller negative feedback.  When I ordered this movie I was under the impression that I was getting an American film with a foreign cover.  Well I got the foreign film that it is.  Obviously I did not pay attention to the site when it told me it was in French.  Now that I got my stupidity out there, you might not want to read any more of this review, as I am apparently not all that bright.    I won't relive the story as many other reviewers like to do.  I read the product description (minus Language: French).  I am sure you have done the same and don't need me to repeat it here...like so many other people like to do.    And now we are to the whole review part.  Umm, yeah, different.  Wasn't expecting that.  Waste of my time?  No way.  Good flick.  Well printed. Well acted.  Not a slasher movie by any means.  Yes there was some killing, but not the typical, \\"I'll be right back...\\" kind of stuff.  Blood was abundant, but appropriate when used.  I found myself getting caught up in the images so much that I would have to rewind the movie just so I could read the dialog.  I saw someone write that the ending was less than acceptable, and I would have to agree.  It was almost a comical ending.  I think the writers got tired and were probably pressured by a deadline for them to cut it short the way they did.  The movie did drag on at times.  I had to check the timer to see how much movie was left...\\"What?  It is only at 45 minutes?  Seems like it has been at least an hour!\\"...Not saying it was boring.  It kept my attention.  I was just so wrapped up in it that I lost track of time.  Kinda saw one part of it coming near the middle, but, for the most part, I just let the movie take me where it wanted to and sat back to enjoy the movie(as much as a normal person can \\"enjoy\\" a torture film).  No it wasn't easy to watch but that is what makes this movie such a good buy.  People don't buy torture movies because they want to laugh or cry or even be scared.  They want to be disturbed.  They want their bubble to be popped.  They don't want to be comfortable.  They want their views of the world (as well as life in general) to be challenged.  Or they make a mistake and buy the wrong movie.  After a few minutes the mistakers (I just made that up...you like it?) should turn off the movie as quickly as possible and press on with their lives as if nothing ever happened.  There is no need to review a well made movie simply because you are not comfortable with the subject.  Wait that sounds like I am into torture.  I am not.  Hmm...where was I going with that?  So anyway, I am now bashing people that bashed this movie so this review has taken a turn for the worse.      My movie is over and I am left with the feeling of what now.  What am I supposed to feel based on what I have seen over the last 90 minutes?  Am I outraged?  Am I saddened?  Am I supposed to feel intensly sorry for the women tortured?  Am I supposed to want to save the world or am I just supposed to know that this kind of weirdness is present in the world?  I am left with this cloud in my head...not sure what is in there.  I will just have to feel around for a while to get my bearings.      BTW, I saw on this page Amazon says there is an intro.  I didn't get that on my version of the DVD.  Hope you enjoy it.    Bottom line: Would I buy the movie again?  I have bought duplicate movies (let me refer you to paragraph 1), but if I had lost my copy of this movie or had rented it, the answer is yes I would buy this movie.
B0026ICMLO|5.0|I like this movie a lot, it is a great disney presentation, i would prefered in a blu ray boz size, but i feel very dissaponited with amazon.com shipment service, because my specia edition box came several damage, i am from Venezuela, it is very expensieve for to sent my damage item back, amazon.con should be more carefully with this stuff
0307346617|4.0|This as we know is a work of fiction. But after reading what the reaction of the many governments of the world were in this story...it kind of chilled me because I really DO believe that this is what their reaction would be. Our own government letting us be basically on our own as they retreated to make their final stand was a little upsetting. However, the book does prove that the regular foot soldier knows more about how to fight a war, than most damn generals do.    I listened to the author speak about this book on the radio show \\"Coast to Coast AM\\" and it was a very entertaining interview. It reminded me of the War Of The Worlds, because Max Brooks and the host of the show were acting as though World War Z had actually taken place.     All in all the book is a really good read. I would have liked to have the book gone into a little more detail about the virus itself. Maybe devoted a chapter at the end to study or something. Max Brooks is a talented writer, but being a offspring of the great Mel Brooks, this should not come as a shock. I do recommend this book to anyone who like science fiction. Enjoy!!

B002LK3DUQ|5.0|This movie was an emotional roller-coaster, and filled with themes of love and loss, divorce, caring for the elderly, urbanization,  oh my! It was a great movie, with lots to think and talk about with your family. Overall an uplifting (no pun intended) movie with lovable characters and a wonderfully unique storyline. Pixar is the BEST.
B00003CXA6|5.0|This was an awesome movie. The sound track is stirring and with it you feel as tho you are there, in the mist of this historic battle of our nation. The colors are clear and sharp as is the movie itsself. The only thing that was wrong with this movie is the Disk itsself. Its two sided, which is fine, but not marked as side A and B, which I had to do. Other than that I urge people to purchase this movie, sit back and feel the hair raise on your arm's, and neck when the music sound track starts, right at the begining. Your heart starts beatting, you sit on the edge of your chair, and you may find yourself rooting the troops on, whichever side, Blue or Grey, you favor. Historicly speaking, this battle of wills UNITED a Nation split apart from itsself. Watch the movie, see that for yourself.                                            Julius J.

B001BTG3OQ|4.0|I love this flash.  I've had my SB-900 for about a year now, and am still amazed at how well it works.  The worst thing about it is how difficult it is to understand and learn how to use.  It also takes a much longer than normal amount of time to recycle after each flash.  This is a huge problem when shooting a wedding or trying to get any number of action shots!  It goes through batteries like crazy too.  Still all-in-all, I love the flash, and it gives me great results even in the worst of lighting situations if I have time to wait until it recycles each time!
B000O77QD8|5.0|This DVD is blu ray and really looks crystal clear on my HDTV! Great interactive menus and docudrama included.  The picture is set in WWII and has that \\"look\\" about it. It's NOT your TV, it's the way it was filmed. You know the story, six Marines raise the flag on Mt. Suribachi, in February of 1945. A picture was taken that mesmerised the country and the three marines that weren't killed, in the meantime, were sent on a bond tour that raised more money than ALL previous Bond tours combined! You learn about the men who raised the flags(yes there were TWO flags raised that day. The flag that became famous and which the picture won a Pulitzer prize was hardly even noticed when these Marines changed the first flag out, because a politician wanted that first flag) in a way that was never told before. Great story, well filmed! The actual war scenes are graphic, but the main story is about the men who raised the flag and less on the actual battle.

B000002GK1|4.0|It is easy to forget just how successful the Badmotorfinger formula was for this first generation grunge juggernaut, especially in the face of a more artistically diverse follow-up, but Soundgarden's third record still hits hard as the well oiled, deceptively deep machine that it is.
0380730405|5.0|I never re-read books. How can I find time when there is so much I haven't even read for a first time? But I wanted to try and so I did with Rebecca. A novel I first read over 15 years ago. Funny how little I remember, including the climax and the surprise and bitter ending. The writing is superb, and I was inseparable from the book through the last 100 pages. The character development and depiction is one of the strongest traits of du Maurier, and it is no better pronounced than in the characters of Manderly - the estate, Mrs. Danvers, and Rebecca herself. Manderly being the ultimate beautiful estate, which becomes the unnecessary victim in this harsh story of murder, mystery and a fight for justice. Rebecca is as much alive as she is dead, and our narrator remains nameless throughout. Even on a second read, the book captivated me through and through, and I am quite happy to have gone down the pages one more time. Highly recommend it.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, it was an easy read and had a little surprise to it.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|This is not a journey through space and time, 'where no man has gone before'...This is a frenetic, jarring ride on a lumbering bovine-drawn cart (thus the word 'trek') through territory which has previously so exhausted our visual purple that we see only negative after-images. To label the project derivative would be excessively flattering.  Just a few glaring flaws...   The Romulan ship looks like some grade-school Lego project submitted by a cephalopod on crack. The science is on a lower grade /phylogenetic level. The sets look like something out of the Industrial Revolution...not a hint of Star Wars , Alien/Aliens or Raiders here. In this economy, can't the location scouts find another abandoned warehouse?  The players are all caricatures of caricatures. In some installments you ignored the 'acting' as the story was intriguing or unique enough to blind you to it. Not here.  Was Winona incarcerated at GITMO, or what? She can act, but is not allowed the opportunity under the burqa.  And poor Leonard (who never could act)...looks like he was driven out of some third-world ICU with a cattle-prod.    The action-action-action films of late all look and feel and smell the same. Smell?  The odor of decaying gray matter. I thought this was the bailiwick of public education.    There is simply nothing of substance here...it passes through your system for two hours without impacting anything: 'The Neutrino Effect'. Purely juvenile in its conception and presentation.
0307271757|5.0|This collection consists of the Charles Dickens' Christmas Books, all written in the 1840s<br /><br />A Christmas Carol (1843).  Everyone knows the story of how Ebenezer Scrooge the miser got the Christams message from his late partner and the three ghosts.<br /><br />The Chimes (1844).  Porter Trotty Veck has no hope for the future on New Year's Eve until he hears the spirits of the chimes.<br /><br />The Cricket on the Hearth (1845).  John is much older than his wife Dot, but their marriage appears to be over when he finds evidence that makes him believe she cuckold him.  John talks with the spirit of the Cricket on the Hearth whose chirping Dot says means good luck.<br /><br />The Battle of Life (1846).  Doctor Jeddler is a cynic, but his daughters' sacrifices for loved ones make him reconsider his scorn.<br /><br />The Haunted Man and the Ghost (1848).  Chemistry Professor Redlaw is tormented by his past until a ghostly twin arrives on Christmas Eve to make him forget his past; afterward any one who meets the professor also forgets their distress as he does with the Swidger and Tetterby families until Milly Swidger reverses the spell because of her goodness that comes out of a lost child<br /><br />The reprint of Charles Dickens early Victorian Christmas stories will prove a delight for fans of the most famous entry, A Christmas Carol.  The Cricket on the Hearth and The Haunted Man and the Ghost are somewhat similar in lessons learned to that of A Christmas Carol though with their own inspiring twists while The Chimes uses a spiritual adviser but spins quite differently.  However, the most diverse is The Battle of Life, which has a rushed ending and no paranormal guru as it feels more like O'Henry's The Gift of the Magi.  This is a holiday winner as all five tales showcase the works of one of the greats of literature.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
0316044695|5.0|I read this book right after it came out.  What an amazing story.  His courage and will to survive is inspiring.  I also bought a copy for my father.  I rarely buy books for others because reading is a rather personal decision.  I read a lot of books.  Most just fly out of my head with no impact on my life.  But not this one.  It stayed with me.  I am not a military buff and I don't read \\"war stories.\\"  I saw Mr. Luttrell interviewed on the Today show.  I went out that morning and bought two copies.
B000PMGS8G|4.0|Flash Gordon Saviour of the Universe is just a great load of cheesy good fun. It's not really for young kids because there's too much almost-sex in it, but for adults, it's just fun and goofy. I mean, the Hawk Men, with Brian Blessed as Voltan? Classic and hilarious.<br /><br />Topol as Dr. Hans Zarkov is the reason I bought the movie, and I wasn't disappointed in his performance at all.<br /><br />I highly recommend it to all with a heart for silliness and fun!<br /><br />Beware of the sound track. You'll be singing \\"FLASH! AAAAAAAAHHHHH!\\" in the shower without even trying.
B002JODUI4|5.0|A little different than his previous music.  His other works have been very vibrant and huge dance tracks.  This set of tunes is like opening box after box of new sounds and experiences.  I categorize his music as trance/jazz. This work is art and an \\"experience\\" - a joyful one full of slips, slides, and surprises.  His work stands alone.  Deadmau5 is definately music to get into.  Also check out his collaborations with others; i.e. Kaskade.  I hope he continues doing great things.
B00005JMK0|5.0|Love this movie. It's helped me appreciate classical music much more, especially Bach's minute in G from the Anna Magdalena Notebook, which was used during the \\"duel\\" scene. Bought the import DVD knowing it's going to be bad (of course I was right). Please release the DVD. I can't wait.
B0021L8UPS|2.0|I couldnt wait for this movie to hit theaters when i had seen it, it seemed a little slow for me i guess i expecited more half way through it got going and it wasnt really till the end of the movie it got really good with a huge twist i wasnt expecting, over all its okay to watch once and mabey own a copy of but i wouldnt spend a ton of money on that copy.
B001IAOEXU|3.0|I bought this item with my PS3 slim 120gb after reading several reviewssaying it is a great item. While I don't have a problem with it's functionality, I find that the dualshock 3 pads are perfectly OK without this attachment and I have never encountered any slippage in the course of gameplay. I'd also like to add that when I have the triggers attached, if I attempt using the R1 and R2 buttons the triggers almost always pinch the skin on my fingers so while it provides a marginally better grip of the shoulder buttons, it pinches you in the process.
B002K0WBY6|5.0|If you are a fan of the behind the scenes then the 2 disc is for you. This is a very enjoyable movie, one that keeps on giving. The comedic timing of both Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds is excellent.  And who cannot love Betty White, who remains at the top of the game,  not to mention Mary Steenburgen and Craig T Nelson.  This is a movie that both the guys and the girls will enjoy.  It is a non romance romance and is HILARIOUS.
0547258305|5.0|i barely read. my teacher had the class read the first chapter from this book and after that i had to buy it. the book is great!
B00284BNKC|5.0|First of all, this really is a stunning, staggering, heart-wrenching film. It's sad and beautiful world (as [[ASIN:B00005JKFX Jim Jarmusch]] might say) full of flawed characters, and Ellen Burstyn was magnificent. That Julia Roberts won Best Actress over her is a crime against decent film-lovers everywhere. But be fore-warned: Based on [[ASIN:1560252480 the novel by Hubert Selby]], this is NOT a plucky, feel-good experience. It's overwhelmingly raw, and probably not for all tastes ( I'm looking at you, [[ASIN:B001LAGDMM Norbit fans]])<br /><br />But, as for this disc: Here is a prime example of why people bother upgrading their media to the latest-and-greatest format. Daily, I have to fight the urge to waste money on new versions of movies I already own (& I did already own the fine [[ASIN:B00005Q4CS Requiem for a Dream (Director's Cut)]] DVD of this), but I couldn't resist a film that looks and sounds this good. [Side note: The [[ASIN:B00004Y6Q5 Kronos Quartet soundtrack]] is spectacular.]<br /><br />If you've already got the setup (HDTV or projector, sound system, etc) than you can do a lot worse. And for even more eye-candy, give [[ASIN:B000O7667K The Fountain ]] a try.
B000WXVJ6Y|3.0|The first time I listened to this album I thought it was awful! I hated wind it up and sweet escape woo-hoo was annoying and well I wanted my money back! But then I relistened at Now That You Got It became my favorite Gwen Stefani song of all! The thing about Sweet Escape that's different about her Love Angel Music Baby-is that SE is modern while LAMB has a retro feel, I like both and am glad Gwen did these two albums!
0307716988|5.0|This book was great! I could hardly put it down. It really gives the reader a true insight into the real Michael Jackson. This truly is a must have for any avid fan of MJ's.
B002R4K6AG|5.0|Somehow, this just works. The syrupy background vocals nicely contrast Dylan's gravelly voice.  I cringed when I first saw that he was was releasing a Christmas album.  The instrumentation is nice and varied.  Some of it is bluesy, while other tunes have more traditional arrangements.  I am not a big fan of Christmas music, but this will be in rotation all season long.  It's a lot better than his last album, Together Through Life, which I listen to, but hasn't really stuck on me yet.

0307588335|5.0|The pleasure and enlightenment I derived from reading \\"A Colossal Failure of Common Sense\\" is in a class of its own. I am not  employed in the financial sector and although I am a daily reader of the WSJ, I never fully grasped the fundamentals of the underlying financial \\"house of cards\\" created by the CDO  and CDS instruments until I read this book. I have reached a point in my life where I only read non-fiction as I find it more enjoyable - and enlightening - than fiction.  This book was more entertaining and could easily stand up to the many novels I have read in the past, written by authors including Frederick Forsythe, Robert Ludlum, Ken Follett, John Grisham, David Baldacci, Leon Uris and James Clavell. In my opinion, Mr. MacDonald is in pretty good company, especially considering that finance and entrepreneurship, not writing, are his primary talents.  As works of business non-fiction go, I place this this book in the same league as Kurt Eichenwald's \\"Conspiracy of Fools\\" for an excellent narrative of business folly. As far as a Wall Street thriller, the only book that even comes close to \\"Colossal Failure\\" is James Stewart's \\"Den of Thieves.\\"    The book's Prologue establishes the single most-important underlying factor leading to Lehman Brothers' demise - the repeal of the Glass-Steagall act, almost ten years earlier. With the premise set, Mr. MacDonald's then begins his narrative with a concise autobirgraphical profile of his life leading up to his employment with Lehman Brothers. Not a child of privelege with an Ivy League legacy, the author is clearly a scrapper who attends a public university and works his butt off enroute to his Wall Street (really 7th Avenue) dream job. His early career successes, first as a frozen foods salesman (who becomes the company's top performer leading to a promotion to management which he ultimately declines), then as a top producing stock broker for Merril Lynch in Philadelphia and as a dot-com entrepeneuer who makes his first couple of million before he is 30, would typically be satisfying enough for most people. But not for Larry MacDonald. He had set his lifelong goal of getting to the epicenter of finance, to a bulge-bracket investment bank in NYC. With the help of a childhood friend, whose relationship with the author is well established early in the book, he lands a job as a bond trader at Lehman.  From this \\"ring-side seat\\" he then meticulously but simply describes the events which lead to the fall of Lehman Brothers (as well as Bear Sterns,, Merril Lynch and AIG) and to the global economic meltdown of Septemebr 2008. He explains this in layman's terms and provides clarity to the many complex financial vehicles which combine to create the critical mass that's leads to the world's financial implosion. Along the way, the reader can sense the impending doom and is held in continual suspense (even though one knows the final outcome.)  Throughout the book, I felt as if I personally knew the many characters because Mr. MacDonald does such an excellent job describing them. More importantly, I wanted to be with them during their many financial adventures. Reading this book was the next best thing to actually being there.
B002NWRMVS|1.0|This music seems engineered to appeal to the broadest audience possible -inoffensive, unexciting, mediocre in every way.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow: 8 out of 10: It was King Kong that made me fall in love with the movie. He doesn't appear himself (unlike ring mate Godzilla who cameos in silhouette in a Japanese newspaper.) but his ship and his friends are there and his tree is there. You know the moss covered tree that covers the impossibly deep chasm. To one he uses to fling helpless sailors to there death like some kind of lumberjack games blood sport. There the tree is in glorious faded color just as I left it in the imagination of my seven-year old self.     I was enjoying myself up to that point mind you I had for one thing decided that this was an Anime rather than a regular film. (The giant robots make this illusion much more palatable as did an annoying performance by Miss Paltrow. In anime, the female characters are usually whining up a storm.) This allowed all the plot holes, substandard acting (along with Gwyneth Paltrows overbearing performance we have the thespian talents of Jude Law) and scientific flubs to fall by the wayside. I just sat back and enjoyed the ride.     A tour de force showing from Angelina Jolie as an eye-patch wearing British Commander also refreshes the movie halfway through. One wishes the film were about her and not the tepid whining leads.       Much has been made of the use of CGI but let us face it. It is simply easier to put CGI effects on an artificial background rather than place them in photo-realistic settings as the snakes of Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid or the wolves in Day after Tomorrow have proved most recently.       Sure Sky Captain is far from perfect. An actual villain would have helped and been more in line with the serials it was emulating. The dialogue sounds like George Lucas wrote it. In addition director Kerry Conran is more an art director than a story teller, but try telling that to the seven year old in me that kept saying, \\"Cool what's next\\".
0375842209|5.0|I have a horrible memory, so one of the most redeeming qualities for me, for a book, is when I can remember it. When it touches me so much that I remember scenes and lines, and images the author created months after having read it. There are a few books I can do that for and The Book Thief is no exception. I read this book in December of 08, and I can still remember most of the plot, some of the things the characters said, and overall my incredible love for Liesel. At such a young age she's already learning so much about life and death, things that a nine year old should not have to deal with. The Book Thief is a good lesson about the Holocaust, even the people who seemed to have it good, or better than others, still had it horrible.<br /><br />Liesel is followed by the narrator from the time when her brother dies and she steals her first book, until the end of the story. And her story is by far heart-wrenching, but also shows the power that kids have: of imagination and the ability to think for themselves. She's a strong girl, with a strong heart, and the ability to know right from wrong even when the entire world around her is denying anything is wrong. My absolute favourite memory of Liesel is actually when she sees the library in the Mayor's house for the first time. I have grown up around libraries and book stores my entire life - My mom used to have closets full of books - I have never been deprived of reading. And yet the Mayor's library is like a treasure trove for Liesel, and through Zusak's writing I honestly felt as if - reading that revelation for Liesel - I had never seen so many books before. I felt her excitement, her amazement at the rows and rows of books. I was in awe right along with her.<br /><br />Other than Liesel, my favourite part of this book, is the writing. I have read so many books in my life, but honestly, never before have I read such a hauntingly beautiful story as I did in The Book Thief. There are so many passages in the book that take ordinary things that we see everyday and put completely new meaning to them.<br /><br />\\"Summer came. For the book thief, everything was going nicely. For me, the sky was the color of Jews.\\"<br />Excerpt pg. 340, The Book Thief<br /><br />This paragraph reminds me of the saying `If walls could talk' - and changing it to `If the sky could talk' - it has definitely seen a lot more then the inside of a house. And Zusak does an amazing job at illustrating that.<br /><br />My absolute favourite part of the entire book, is something you either love or you hate about it: the narrator. If you read any review on this book you will notice that they always mention the narrator. Being of course, Death, himself. Most people love this, some do hate it though. I am one of the former, but even being one of the later you have to admit that this is something unique. As a designer, I often find myself saying that `There are no original ideas, just new takes on old ones', and often times that applies to books as well. This is something that I have never seen done before, a story from the point of view of Death? Especially in such a place experiencing death in such an excruciating way. The Book Thief gives a whole new meaning to the past, and to having sympathy for the Devil... or well Death, at least.gs that we see everyday and put completely new meaning to them.    \\"Summer came.

B000P0I4O4|3.0|The Contract: 5 out of 10: Let me start by quoting Variety's review which easy sums up my feelings about this film better than I ever could. Scripters Stephen Katz and John Darrouzet don't inspire great expectations with their contrived setup, so it can't be said that what follows -- pretty much your standard-issue, pursuit-through-the-wilderness melodrama -- is, in the strictest sense of the term, disappointing. But it's more than fair to complain about the plodding predictability of a by-the-numbers scenario that, 30 years ago, might have served as the blueprint for a routine TV movie. (Think Darren McGavin in Freeman's role, then sub in Doug McClure for Cusack.)    There it is concisely; a predictable by the numbers thriller that went straight to DVD despite starring Morgan Freeman and John Cusack.    This is a remarkably average film. Morgan Freeman plays an old sardonic assassin. A bad guy with depth, education and possibly (could it be) a heart. In other words the usual Morgan Freeman role. Like Alan Arkin, Freeman has comfortable found a persona that gathers a steady paycheck. To Freemans credit, at least he is fun to watch and has fun with the role.    That certainly cannot be said of John Cusacks overly serious, charisma free turn as the recently widowed, and ex-cop single father. Cusack acts as if he is spending the entire movie working on a particularly troublesome bowl movement. Considering the lightweight proceedings around him, and co-star Freemans paycheck turn; this method acting madness seems out of place.    The plot summarized is Freeman get captured, escapes while in handcuffs, gets recaptured by Cusack on a father son bonding hike, then they all find themselves on the run with Freemans fellow assassins and the FBI in pursuit.     One strange development is the attempt to give widowed Cusack a love interest in the middle of the forest. Cusack and son run into a hot blonde, Calista Flockheart lookalike skinny dipping (attractive Megan Dodds)and her fiancé. Cusack somehow convinces them that he is an okay guy; even though he is in the woods with a gun pointed at a handcuffed, elderly black man.    The fiancé is a funny character. A San Francisco lawyer, who hate the wilderness, has an effeminate manner and wears (you cannot make this up) an ascot. What? Is the Mystery Machine parked nearby? Needless to say, he gets killed by a sniper to make room for Cusack. His fiancées reaction to his bloody death? meh.    Which nicely sums up my reaction to this movie.
032147404X|2.0|As other reviews have noted, Scott Kelby's puns are either something you like, are distracted by or absolutely loathe. In this it is a matter of each to their own.    However a lot of the advice in this book is not useful or very one-sided. For example, the section on sports photography (on which their is an entire chapter) may be summed up by saying \\"it is expensive\\". To be fair there is some useful advice (such as many of the professionals take two bodies, one with a wide-angle lens and one with a fast telephoto because you *won't* have time to switch lenses) which is why I gave the book two stars.    The most disappointing piece of \\"advice\\" was on \\"Being careful what you shoot\\". Kelby suggests that you delete pictures if security guards demand it, otherwise they may take your camera etc. They have no right to do this .... the excellent \\"rights of photographers\\" by Lawyer Bert Krages tells you about what right mere security guards (and even police officers have) and it does NOT include demanding that you delete pictures from your camera. At best the guards can require you to leave the area (if you are on their property) but they cannot generally demand that you stop taking pictures from a public area. It is true that some will try and harass you, but you are within your rights to refuse to delete your pictures and they (in particular, security guards) cannot detain you. This is even true for government buildings; although with military bases you are probably on your own =).     If Kelby had claimed that you risk being harassed if you took pictures of government buildings, and that you may wish to delete your pictures to avoid problems then that may be sound advice. But he writes that if he had not deleted his pictures he would have probably had his camera removed (factually false -- if this happens it is theft; call the police) -- and encourages photographers to roll over on their civil rights.     It seems that Kelby's ignorance will not stop him from making veryauthoritive statements, and to me this brings into question much of the other (also very authoritatively) stated advice.
0740785508|5.0|As someone with both a son and a partner who are both fine artists, and as someone who does a bit of 'hobby' painting,  I was really very curious and excited to take a look at James Gurney's Imaginative Realism.  I was not at all disappointed.  Unlike other books that show how to sketch what you see, carve out shadow and light with the techniques of the author, Gurney gives a really great rundown on how to see what is in front of you in order to paint it more realistically.  I have particularly been partial to his work with National Geographic and his renditions of Ancient Egyptian culturre and reconstruction of earlier temples, tombs,etc. Not just painting from imagination, James Gurney does the homework about how people, places and things should look as well as the drape of fabric, gesture, expression and he does it in a way that helps artists keep those things in their heads and put it on the canvas.<br /><br />I was very impressed with his understanding of texture, technique to make a piece look more period, and the use of architectural marquettes and the effective lighting of these in order to really add the idea that you could step into the painting.  Whether you are painting what you envision might have happened in history, or thinking up an alternative one to put on canvas, this book really was a pleasure.  I spent hours just going through the picture and graphic rich pages.  This one is definitely one for the shelf of any fine, graphic, or computer artist.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|I previewed this album and was not a fan.   But then I had to think back to my initial response to other Mayer albums.  Listen to it again, and before you know it, you'll be singing along, picking up on the minute details that make all of his albums great.  It is a house album, that HE produced, it is breaking some new ground, there is experimenting, which at times may seem like a mess, but in the grand scheme creates a piece of art.      Give it a chance.  It's not blues, its not rock, its not pop, what it is, is an expression of an artist.  Respect it for that, not what YOU as the listener were expecting, or that YOU wanted made.  Honestly most of the listener desired music is garbage.  Let the Artist dictate what art is, not the spectator.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|I have this image of J.J. Abrams waiting like a vulture for Gene Roddenberry to die so he can swoop down on the Star Trek franchise and remake it in his image. It's been a long time since a movie's ending depressed me as much as this one did. The beloved Star Trek Universe is no more. All that's left is a cast of caricatures with the same names. This is not Star Trek by any stretch. This travesty is compounded by the unfortunate trotting out of Leonard Nimoy to somehow lend a whiff of legitimacy to this \\"reboot\\".<br /><br />\\"This isn't your father's Star Trek,\\" the hype proclaimed. It sure isn't. What it is is a younger generation's plundering of the dreams of those who've gone before, twisted and claimed as their own. Pity Abrams didn't possess the creative spark to envision his own universe instead of corrupting the work of a dead man.<br /><br />I guess I'll finish completing my collection of Star Trek: TNG to go along with my DS9 and Voyager collections since this film marks the end of Roddenberry's vision of the the future.
B0002S947K|5.0|When I first bought this CD I didn't really like it. I listen to it in the car on the way home, then it sat for a few weeks. However once I really listen to it a few times, that's when I knew this was a great CD. The more I listen, the more I enjoy it. The recording quality is very good, if you have high end audio system you will really love this CD. Very musical.
0060558121|1.0|I don't want to go into too much detail due to the vast number of reviews but this book started out as a real page turner and turned into a real fight just to finish...<br /><br />SPOILERS!<br /><br />1) Gaiman craps on Norse mythology.<br /><br />Yah, Thor shooting himself in the head is going to happen. I'm sorry but you have to be respectful about established \\"characters\\" and Odin, the all-father, as a double dealing scumbag? Give me a break.<br /><br />2) Who do you root for?<br /><br />Shadow is painfully boring. Laura is a cheating skank. Both sides in the \\"war\\" are painfully uninteresting. I wanted them all to just go away by the end of the book.<br /><br />3) Needs an editor.<br /><br />Why did we need like a hundred pages of Shadow settling in Lakewood (Lakeside?) with no payoff for those pages?<br /><br />etc...etc...etc.. (I could go on and on)...I think Gaiman wrote the first two hundred pages in a fit of creativity and had no idea where to go from there...and it shows.

B002N2XHXU|5.0|A Long Way Gone; Memoirs of a Boy Soldier was written by a young man from Sierra Leone, Ishmael Beah. Beah's work was nominated for a Quill award in the Best Debut Author category. A Long Way Gone; Memoirs of a Boy Soldier is a nonfiction book. His purpose was to reach others by telling his life story as a young boy, who spent his early teen years running from rebels, watching his people die and even joining the army to kill others.       Beah's style of writing makes for a very easy read, I have been able to understand everything, and I definitely believe that his writing is accessible to all readers.        The main idea of the work is for us to walk through the life of a young boy, and for us to be put in his shoes. What make's this book so good is the visuals that the author sets up through his text. He makes it so easy for us to be a part of his story. \\"The last casualty that we saw that evening was a woman who carried her baby on her back. Blood was running down her dress and dripping behind her, making a trail. Her child had been shot dead as she ran for her life.\\"  You can demonstrate the author's talent or the feel of the book through a quote based on how you can relate to it, understand it, see it, feel it or be a part of the quote.
B001UNSZSA|1.0|The Doors - The Soft Parade (AFZ 038)    The original mixes are compressed on the Steve Hoffman mastered CD.      Regardless of ones opinion of the sound, these CDs should not reveal compression beyond that used during mixing.  The 1988 Elektra CD reveals that the original mixes are available without the compression that is found on the AF CD.  Since AF states they are using the original master tapes and that they are not adding compression in anyway, there should not be more compression on their release.  If anything, copy tapes would have more compression than master tapes.  For instance, if the 1988 CD was made from a copy and the AF was made from the master, the AF should have the same, or greater dynamic range.  Oddly, the 40th anniversary remixes do not reveal the compression that has been applied to the original mixes.    Contact \\"Dream Operator\\" on IMWAN for more information.
B00003CXTG|2.0|You know, I can think of other film directors besides Michael Bay who could have done a much better job of filming Pearl Harbor, a film that had lots of potential before it was turned into an overproduced train wreck. Let's see, there's Michael Mann, Ridley Scott, Terrance Malick, heck, even Stephen Spielberg! But what did Touchstone do? Accept a horrible script and hire Michael Bay (of all people!) to direct a romantic film that just happens to be set before, during, and after the notorious attack of Pearl Harbor. To be honest, I don't completely hate Bay. He has created two great action films: The Rock and Bad Boys II (the former being slightly more realistic than the latter). But to have him do a historical film like this? Something toxic must have been in the producers' coffee, because what we get is something that's uneven and unconvincing. This is basically a love story that's mixed with a major historical event, and we've seen that sort of film before, haven't we? *cough* Titanic *cough*<br /><br />The only good things about this film are the special effects, the action, and the drama during the actual attack on the harbor.  The rest of the film is nothing but an embarrassment. The actors' talents have been wasted because of a script that's filled with silly dialogue and cliched scenarios. The film itself is too darn long: even if it is supposed to be a war epic, it certainly doesn't feel like a war film at all. But I think the worst thing about this movie is the fact that they just happened to insert a romantic plot, a love triangle that has nothing to do with Pearl Harbor itself. The film would have worked better if it was a coming-of-age story, or a political thriller. But no, we have uninteresting characters falling in love with each other, and all of it is just painful to sit through. It's more of a soap opera, at least to me. Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, Josh Hartnett, Alex Baldwin, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, and Cuba Gooding Jr. are all very good actors. It's too bad, however, that they had to appear in this wasted opportunity of a war epic.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but all of the men and women who have lost their lives on December 7th, 1941, deserve a more provocative film about that dreadful day. The brilliant special effects and the intense action sequences really cannot make up for the inappropriate romance, the dull characters, the unbelievably bad script, and the obvious cliches that take control of this movie. I think I should check out Tora! Tora! Tora! very soon.<br /><br />Grade: D-too bad, however, that they had to appear in this wasted opportunity of a war epic.

B002IRYYE6|2.0|The Pretenders - The Pretenders (AFZ 052)    This CD has two issues:    1.  A \\"phone ring\\" sound effect is missing from the song \\"The Phone Call\\".    Steve had stated that the master tape did not have the sound effects on it.  The sound effects were to be \\"flown in\\" using a digital workstation.      From an email that I received from Marshall:    \\"As to the ringtone, we used the original English master, which did not have the phone ring. The ring was added later.\\"    2.  The disc has compression on it that is not found on the original Sire CD.   Regardless of ones opinion of the sound, AF CDs should not have compression on them, per the statement on each CD \\"The original dynamic range of this recording has not been maximized, brickwalled, limited or compressed in any way during remastering\\".    Steve was not around the forum during the discovery of the issues by forum members.  A few weeks prior to the discovery, he had stated that his PC \\"blew up\\" and that he wouldn't be around for awhile.  He came back to the forum after a few days of discussion regarding the issues on this CD and said this:    \\"Hi everyone,    So how do we like the Pretenders so far?    Kidding.    Obviously I can't talk about it.  If you like the sound of the disk, keep it and enjoy it.  If you are on the fence and sort of like it or are a collector, keep it as a unique item.  If you don't like what happened to it, just return it as defective, it's sold out of the run anyway.    Trust me, this FUBAR situation won't happen again on anything I master. This is not AF's fault.    Once again, if you like it, keep it, if you don't, return it as defective.    Please don't ask me any more questions as I can't answer them.\\"
B002WPVNZM|5.0|This album is just plain amazing, wasn't sure if I was going to buy it first but the singles swayed me over to this amazing artwork, completely worth it, and the Deluxe version is less expensive than the original!
B0026JWDQW|5.0|this is a great Cd. perfect for all ages..makes me want to get up & dance like I did when I was in my 20's.  very uplifting and soulful at the same time.
0385504225|2.0|The story was enjoyable and showed promise (the Masonic stuff is weird and interesting) but it was signficantly hampered by the continuous hammering away on the \\"all religions are the same\\" and \\"modern science is a pale reflection of ancient wisdom (as are modern religions)\\" themes.  Honestly, this book reminds me of that happened to Tom Clancy as his later novels turned from tightly wound page turners to platforms for going on and on about his own brand of reactionary idealogy.  This advocacy all happens through the characters.  It kills the story.  The other problem is that if these ideas were truly put forward and the author was forced to support and defend them on their merits, they wouldn't stand up for a minute.  More importantly, no one would bother to read it.  So the author, who can write a great story, has the characters blather on and on about the idealogy and the reader must endure it to get to the story.  That is frustrating.  Seems a bit of a fraud.
B0006Z2KYI|5.0|To Be or Not To Be is an outstanding black comedy that works on every level; I have rarely watched a film with this much humor and action combined. The script was very well written and the casting couldn't have been better. If poor Carole Lombard had to go out of this world after making a film, at least she went out after making this; she recalled that it was the best experience she had as a screen star. The cinematography and the choreography shine and the acting is very convincing as well. If I sound like I'm gushing about this it's because I was thrilled with this picture and it will remain in my collection for years to come. My only quibble is that at certain points the quality of the print could have been a bit better; but this is minor and the sound is excellent.<br /><br />When the action starts, we see a Polish local theater company preparing for their opening night of a play critical of Hitler and Nazism. Joseph Tura (Jack Benny) and his wife Maria (Carole Lombard) star in the show; but we meet other actors in the troop including Bronski who is playing Hitler; Greenberg who complains that he's only cast as an extra; producer Dobosh (Charles Halton) and more. However, at the last minute a government minister comes to tell them that they cannot put on the play because it might offend Hitler--so they hastily prepare for Hamlet with Joseph playing the role of Hamlet.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there's even more trouble than the impending Nazi invasion of Poland. Maria, Joseph's wife, Maria, has been getting flowers from an admirer who turns out to be Polish Lieut. Stanislav Sobinski (Robert Stack). Moreover, a trusted and esteemed Polish professor by the name of Siletsky goes on a secret mission for Poland and gets the names of the families who are in the Polish resistance movement--only it turns out that Siletsky is actually working for the Nazis as a spy and he wants to turn over the names of the resistance fighters and their families to the Gestapo.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil too much of this for you; suffice it to say that there are many quick plot twists that make for a whopper of a movie with action, suspense and some really good laughs. Look also for a great performance by Sig Ruman as Nazi Captain Ehrhardt; In addition, the DVD comes with two extras; we get \\"The Rounder\\" and \\"Buy Savings Bonds! A Patriotic Drama.\\"<br /><br />To Be or Not To Be rightfully deserves its place as one of the funniest films ever according to The American Film Institute. I highly recommend this film for anyone who enjoys black comedy; and fans of the actors in this film will love it./>I don't want to spoil too much of this for you; suffice it to say that there are many quick plot twists that make for a whopper of a movie with action, suspense and some really good laughs.

B002P7UCMC|5.0|Rammstein never ceases to amaze with ALL their albums, and this album did exactly the same    just like the previous two, it still has the heavy sound and articulate&strong vocals    While it may sound a bit like Rosenrot or Reise, Reise, this album takes it a whole another level, with the same sound of course    Which is another thing I love about Rammstein: they NEVER change their sound yet they keep getting better each time they release a new album    Overall, Liebe Ist Fur Alle Da is another great album and definitely suggest that you buy it if you're a Rammstein fan and you won't be let down
0061703257|4.0|This book is a real page turner. Each time you think you've got it figured out, BAM, another twist. Read this book!
0446677450|1.0|There are a lot of fanatically supportive readers of this book.  I for one am dubious.  How many of them are millionaires?  Is having a lot of money going to make you happy?  I'm happy and I'm NOT rich.  I can't tell you if you'll get rich reading ANY R.K book, but I can tell you one thing.  I'd be hundreds of dollars richer if I left the room any time this man's name was mentioned.  I would spit on Rich dad.  But he isn't real.  I may go to my local library and destroy his book.  Many reviewers said this book mande them think.  If that's what you want to do, read Mein Kampf.  Like RDPD in that it's sort of internally consistent, nonsensical and completely insane.  It's Amway people.  It's all Amway.  Here's my advice for getting rich.  Save money.  When the economy tanks, buy all the undervalued stock you can.  Wait until the economy turns around and sell.  I've made between 2 and 10 times my money back, depending on the stock.  Another piece of advice.  Don't listen to any financial advisors on when to buy or sell.  They've got a lot of great information on how a company is doing but that doesn't mean they know what you should do.  A lot of people lost a lot of money listening to Jim Cramer.  I made some money doing the opposite.  Maybe it's time to take a look at yourself.  Why are you so fixated on getting rich?  Do you think your life will be so much better?  All of the best things that have happened to me would have happened regardless of my financial situation.  Conversely, we will all die one day.  On that day we will all have a chance to look back at our lives and with some regrets I'm sure.  Don't die thinking that you should have paid more attention to your family than the mad scribblings of a faux-wealty Hawaiian.
B002OFWG7O|4.0|Only one complaint I wish they had their version of Band On Tthe Run on this cd. I think every one has their favorite Foo songs, so read the songs if you like 'em buy it. One dude on here wrote 12 old songs and 2 new ones, well no crap it would be strange to have a greatest hits album with 14 new songs on it. The dvd is swell as well, it is missing a couple of my favorites but it also has some that I hadn't seen. Overall I think it is a bargain plenty of Foo for your dollar.
B002OOG6RQ|5.0|If you're a Rammstein fan, then just get this don't wonder if its good or not. Liebe Ist Fur Alle Da is an improvement from  Rosenrot the best Rammstein has put out in a while. Personally, I think Sehnsucht remains the best and even tough the new album is not their best, well It's better and stronger than the previous releases and a must have for Rammstein fans. What separates this album from the previous Rammstein albums? nothing really only that it is heavier than ever at times and throughout the album it's slow, and it just gets into pure heavy metal. P***y is the weakest song on the record, sure it's enjoyable but there's better songs in there. I don't buy new albums that much since mostly everything sucks now, but older bands still going strong are my only new albums of the year that I buy. From albums released in 2009, this is at least the third new album I've bought and it's not disappointing. Till, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I hear him growl or grunting in a song and it's just bad@ss I love it! Really, thats a pretty heavy song for Rammstein. This album Industrial metal it remains, heavier it gets, and Rammstein it is!
0740785508|5.0|Being a huge fan of Dinotopia, I was extremely excited to learn how the creator imagined up all those wonderful characters and settings and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The tone of the book is not overly academic and the author is not condescending. In fact, the writing style is rather conversational and has a \\"do what you feel most comfortable doing\\" approach while explaining how he approaches his various projects.<br /><br />The book is broken up into the various sections, each building on the prior:<br /><br />* Tradition: He offers a basic overview of art through the ages along with the process and influences of some great artists.<br />* Studio: What items one might need in her personal art studio along with lighting equipment, mediums, and tools.<br />* Preliminary Sketches: How to warm up your imagination, how and why thumbnail sketches can be helpful along with storyboards. He also dips into perspective and how to play with broad spectrum color.<br />* History & Archeology: This section explores how art tells stories and how we can use history, along with perspective, to capture these stories.<br />* People: Drawing people can be tricky, because it's simple to draw two eyes, a nose, a mouth, and limbs, but the key is to bring out the expressiveness of character through facial expressions, posture, and costumes. This chapter also delves in using tools such as live models, photographs, maquettes, and setting to amplify these types of drawings.<br />* Dinosaurs: When people think of dinosaurs, snarling frightening reptilian beasts come to mind, but Gurney challenges us to think of them in a broader perspective, such as going about their daily business (i.e. scratching an itch). Not only that, but placing them in uncommon settings or offering them uncommon elements, such as clothing. He even discusses the benefits of sculpting your own miniatures.<br />* Creatures & Aliens: What would a book on painting what doesn't exist be without a section on all things far-out? But this chapter does more than explain how to imagine an alien, it broaches the subject of mythology (mermaids), the preternatural (human hybrids), supernatural (skeleton pirates), and fantasy (animal characters and cyborgs).<br />* Architecture: Building a city is involved. There are four steps (one of which involved sculpting a maquette) and plenty of time invested, but the end result will be nothing short of magical because although the city might exist nowhere besides your imagination, it might be enough to fool the mind into thinking it does exist somewhere tangible.<br />* Vehicles: Gurney offers valuable advice when he says \\"start with the familiar.\\" He then elaborates by explaining how to mold various objects into a vehicle or exaggerating its features to create something entirely new, but realistic.<br />* Plein-Air Studies: Our world is rife with settings and people and animals which can be sketched on location and then transformed into something fantastical. Gurney explains where and how to look, paying especially close attention to colors and shapes.<br />* Composition: This section discusses how to arrange everything you've learned in the previous chapters into a powerful image with the most impact through tonal values and shape placement. There is even a section which discusses eye-tracking, or the movement of one's eyes as they look at something, and how to exploit it in your artwork.<br />* Procedure: In this section, Gurney gives the general run down of how to proceed with a painting--the first section which could be seen as a \\"stey-by-step.\\" It continues by explaining how to combine all the elements into a finished piece of art.<br />* Careers: The final section is a nice tack-on for anyone interested in developing an art career. It has sections for paperback covers, movie, video game, toy, and theme park design.<br /><br />When I finished, I was blown away by how much art education was packed into such a short book. A majority of the chapters expresses the benefits of creating a maquette, or small sculpted model, when developing a character or scene. This might be overkill for some people, but it helps one think three dimensionally. And there were plenty of other tidbits peppered throughout which made me stop and say, \\"That's a great idea!\\"<br /><br />It's important to note that this is not a typical \\"step 1, step 2\\" how-to-paint book. It's main goal is to offer advice and tips for bringing out your own creativity and developing your own artistic skills, so having a strong foundation in traditional art techniques would be helpful.when developing a character or scene.

B002ELM5HY|5.0|Of course GET LUCKY is a great album. It's a deeper and more personal extension of all the richness and sophistication that has always been present in his work. Fade to Blade, Iron Hand, Prairie Wedding and so many more are all noble antecedents. Like Monteleone, Mark's just getting every single subtle vibration out of his words and music. He's feeling it and so are we. He's very much in his own space, like Lightfoot, and painting away. This is the reflective Mark, not the rock star, and it's a thing of beauty.
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|This uncut version of movie is finally available in the US. I had to buy it on ebay. What a trip, it's like Lord of the Flies on Steroids. This movie holds nothing back.

6305205620|4.0|The stunt in the title is the band making it look like they have caught on fire from the pyrotechnics.  If you don't know this the first time you watch it it's actually a little scary to watch.  Have fun!
1400079179|2.0|Some books have to be read because they are canon, and there are others which must be engaged for the simple, solitary reason that one will be pestered to death by their friends, family members and a multitude of outright strangers until they have done so. The Da Vinci Code, a cheap, popular, and ultimately predictable thriller, is, of course, one of the most famous contemporary examples of the latter group. While it may be utterly expendable, it is, at the same time, more enjoyable than I would like to admit when taken at face value.

0743497465|1.0|One evening, after exploring the natural and man-made wonders of Cappadocia, my solitary musings were interrupted, with some frequency, by the spirited reading of the choicest excerpts of Deception Point. The reader, a fellow traveler, simply could not savor the vapid, vacuous and utterly charmless prose of Dan Brown alone. Given the laughs which ensued, I'm glad he refused to spare the rest of us. But then, my dear reader, that does not mean that you should not spare yourself.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|If you're like me, you know all about Michal Pollan's work, you know our current food production system is unsustainable, and yet, your food consumption habits haven't changed all that much.  Little by little, I've made improvements, and it's the information gleaned from books and documentaries like this one that have caused me to make those incremental changes.  Good ones.  If you don't have as much of a background in food stuff, watch the movie for sure!  And maybe add a few things to your reading list: The Omnivore's Dilemma, In Defense of Food, Super-Size Me, Fast Food Nation, and anything else you hear about while you're learning more.  There are few things in life that contribute as much to who we are as what we eat.  And there are few ways that we can make as great an environmental impact as in our food purchasing decisions.  Learn all you can, and choose.  For your own health, and the planet's.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|This single disc is extremely disappointing. The sound quality on the voice tracks is abominable. Whenever there was any action, the voices were almost overwhelmed by the music or the sound effects.    This was one of these special prices Amazon is running and I don't know if that was the problem, i.e. a cheap copy. I have no idea what the two disc sets sound like. Likely better. I happened to see a bootleg copy that had better sound quality than the single disc.    I can't tell you how disappointed I was. After seeing that bootleg, I was expecting something special on the one I actually bought.

B0012GTZFC|5.0|i've been leading teams for several years now, starting from an 8-man team to now a 115-person team.  i've learned a lot of lessons along the way, read a lot of books, but nothing has crystallized things more clearly than this book.    this book gave me a framework that has helped me retrospectively understand what i did that did or didn't work.      this book made me understand the inflection points in my and my people's careers, and how to accelerate them.    this book made me understand the issues i had with difficult employees, and gave me strategies to apply.    this book has helped me formulate and visualize the aspire-to culture for my teams that almost everyone can get behind.    the lessons in this book are very fractal, they work at many scales - they apply at the individual level, the team level, the cross-organization level, the company level, the human level.      i can't recommend this book enough.

B002QEXN2K|3.0|I've been a huge fan of John Mayer since before Room for Squares was even officially released.  I've followed him throughout his career, been to many of his shows, and loved that he grew as an artist as I grew up as well (I started listening to him at 14, I'm 22 now).  Continuum was, easily, one of the greatest albums I've ever heard and I truly loved the fact that he was finally showing his adult side and moving away from the pop star he used to be.<br /><br />I started seeing the highlights from his recording of this album and I was psyched.  Like a real rock star, he rented out a mansion and converted it into a studio.  I was thinking, \\"He may just top Continuum with this bad boy.\\"<br /><br />Of course, I was there when the stores opened to pick it up.  I waited a few hours to listen to it so that my girlfriend could enjoy it with me as well on our drive to the beach.  She loves it.  I'm not moved.<br /><br />- - -<br /><br />The Cover - It looks like a Michael Bubl&eacute; album or something, or some kind of Christmas album by Harry Connick Jr.  Not a John Mayer-looking cover.  It's like he finally realized people think he's kinda pretty and wanted to show that off while double-modeling for the new Abercrombie ad.<br /><br />'Heartbreak Warfare' - Was a great start, and really got me pumped.  It opens up the theme of the \\"battle studies of the loving heart,\\" and I really thought I was about to be hit hard with some great music.<br /><br />'All We Ever Do Is Say Goodbye' - Alright, I liked this one, but there was nothing special.  It was slow & bluesy & sweet, but there wasn't very much lyrically.<br /><br />'Half of my Heart' - This one is, surprisingly, one of the liveliest of the songs on the album.  It had a bit of a, I don't know, twangy/country feel (maybe for the 'guest star')?  Taylor Swift was in there . . . but for about 10 words.  Hardly 'featuring' anything.  I don't even think that was worth her trip to the studio.<br /><br />'Who Says' - I loved that this was his first release because I thought it was a preview of some ballsy work.  I mean, you're putting out a pop album. . . but, your first release is to put out a song talking about getting stoned?  Kind of doesn't fit to me.  But I really do like this one.  However, this was one of the instances on the album where the song order didn't seem right.  The flow from 'Half of my Heart' into this just did not work for me.  Not to mention it sounded a LOT like 'Stop This Train.'<br /><br />'Perfectly Lonely' - Hey now, there's that guitar, John!  This was a sweet little \\"get over\\" song, but it did sound a bit more like Jack Johnson than John Mayer, to be honest.<br /><br />'Assassin' - This was a good little blues rock track and one of the highlights of the album.  Probably my favourite, or one of my favourites, from the album.<br /><br />'Crossroads' - I'm a huge Robert Johnson fan, of both his music and his tales.  I like what John did here, but it wasn't nearly as good of a rendition as what he did with 'Bold as Love' last time out.<br /><br />'War of My Life' - This is just another \\"nice\\" song.  It's nothing overly special, but it plays on the \\"growing up\\" songs that he has had throughout his career.<br /><br />'Edge of Desire' - This is a beautiful, wonderful, heartbreaking track.  It's very quoteable, very listenable, and overall a very fine track.  Definite highlight from the album.  Great lyrics, great guitar, where is this on the rest of the album?<br /><br />'Do You Know Me' - Another good track.  It blends fine lyrical structure with good music to back it.<br /><br />'Friends, Lovers or Nothing' - This was another very good bluesy/jazzy riff-fest.  It has a sex appeal, but still somehow romantic in its rather unromantic true feelings.  I like it.<br /><br />- - -<br /><br />The one point that basically defines this album comes from my comment on 'All We Ever Do Is Say Goodbye.'  The album is NOT superb lyrically and if you're going to skimp on the lyrics, give us some of your amazing music and jam out with your guitar.  However, he wasn't great on the lyrics. . . and neither was he on the guitar.  Overall, it's a very nice album, but not up to par with John and very few are songs that I'll really be screaming for at his live performances.<br /><br />Overall - 7.25/10<br />As a John Mayer album - 6/10, give us some of your amazing music and jam out with your guitar.  However, he wasn't great on the lyrics. . . and neither was he on the guitar.  Overall, it's a very nice album, but not up to par with John and very few are songs that I'll really be screaming for at his live performances.<br /><br />Overall - 7.25/10<br />As a John Mayer album - 6/10

B002L5GQGY|5.0|This show demonstrates that there are some entertainers out there that know how to ROCK THE HOUSE. I recommend this and Joe's other live shows. Each shows a little different side of him, all good.
B002UD56I6|5.0|Beautiful!  Brilliant!  Breathtaking!    There are so few words that even come close to describing the man who blessed us all with his amazing spirit and unmistakable, endless talent.  'This Is It' takes you inside the awe-inspiring and magical mind that is Michael Jackson.  It feels as though you have been invited, whole heartedly by Michael himself, to listen in on a secret meeting of something great.  Even now, I find it hard to express just how this movie makes me feel.  I can best liken it to the feeling I got when I was little and saw that Santa had brought me the best gift I had wished so hard for.  It's like feeling your heart literally swell up with love and excitement that you are that special to be included.    You quickly learn why Michael Jackson found it difficult to quiet his mind long enough to get some rest.  His talent just seems to pour out of every part of him.  It's hard to find where Michael Jackson ends and the music begins because they are so clearly one and the same.  He is music.  He is soul.  He is love.  And with a broken heart I have to say, Michael Jackson is missed.
0060531053|5.0|This is a great book and reference for anyone wanting to learn to bre beer. Charlie's laid back proze makes it easy for anyone to get started in brewing beer. Jim Koch endorsed this book and it came with my beer kit from beer wine hobby of MA. I would reccomend this book to anyone wanting to get started in brewing their own beer.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Definitely can't wait to get this, but the problem isn't the product, its the fact that Amazon shipped it to the wrong address, it was returned, but they never credited my account nor shipped it again despite customer service calls to fix this, so I find it a bit ironic now that their automated process is asking me for a review for a product they have not yet delivered (1 month later).  :(
B0002V7O3I|4.0|A good movie, cute, fun, corney, very 80's.  I think the target audience for this movie would range from 5 to 13 years old but will still be fun for parents.  The scene with beer may put off some parents, but it's brief, and kids will understand that it was wrong for the boys in the movie to have the beer if it's explained to them.  When I was a kid, me and my friends acted out the creation of the spaceship for weeks and this \\"social huckup\\" was never mentioned.  I especially remembered the fantastic scene where the alien was singing a recording of \\"All Around the World\\" by Little Richard.  A fun side note, the actor that played the male alien \\"Wak\\" is the same actor that played the \\"Star Killer\\" character in the drive-in movie scene.
B002KLAL4W|5.0|For good reason, Pearl Jam fans are always looking for the next Ten, Vs, or other great album from their past.  The source of much angst is the fact that Pearl Jam has changed their albums each time.  Backspacer is a return to their 3rd album, Vitalogy, but only if you take out Vitalogy's filler songs (Bugs, Pry.to, etc.)    Here:  1st two tracks, both fast rockers  then, a solid single type:  The Fixer and Not for you  Then, experimental:  Johnny Guitar and Tremor Christ  Then, mellow:  Just Breathe and Nothingman  Whipping compares to track 6, which name escapes me  Amongst the Waves and Unthought Known compare to Corduroy and Betterman  Speed of sound doesn't compare to Immortality, which is my favorite PJ song, but nothing does anyway.    As you can see, at least in my opinion, this compares to Vitalogy without the filler.  So, to compare PJ albums to past ones, this one actually does.   If you like the music of Vitalogy, you will enjoy Backspacer.  This is nothing like Ten or Vs., or any of their transition albums since Vitalogy.  It's an album for people like me, who think Vitalogy was the best album of the 90s.
B001AVCFK6|1.0|I choose not to see the new Star Trek movie, nor will I ever see it. As a devout fan of Star Trek as far as I'm concerned the 23rd Century (Kirk's time period) ended 15 years ago in Star Trek - Generations (1994). That's where Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) meets Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). The only reason Paramount Pictures brought somebody else in to make a story for Star Trek is because the last 2 treks Insurrection (1998) and Nemesis (2002) with the cast of The Next Generation tried to conceive a villian to out perform the late Ricardo Montalban's performance from The Wrath of Khan (1982). THEY FAILED MISERABLY. However they came close with The Borg in First Contact (1996). And I think Nemesis was pretty good. But I will NEVER see the new Star Trek movies after Nemesis. And William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, Nichelle Nichols, Walter Koenig and George Takei WILL ALWAYS BE Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Uhura, Chekov and Sulu. LOVE LIVE AND PROSPER THE ORIGINAL CAST!!!!!!!!!
B000KUD2G4|3.0|Not sure if the product is working properly, but the hum in my set up is still there. That may be due one or more of the dimmers in the house, which this product may or may not be able to eliminate.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|There is little I can really say about this movie besides the differences between it and the older classic we all know and love.<br /><br />1. The movie has the option of showing paintings on the sides of the film to expand it to widescreen size. I used these and while they looked kind of cool didn't really feel like the biggest improvement to me.<br />2. The sound and picture quality is good but it's a really old film so you can't really push the level of detail up too much. It performs well given the medium, however.<br /><br />In general, you likely can makedo with just the DVD. The fact this combo comes with both a DVD and a Bluray disk obviously is hinting that while bluray is likely the wave of the future not much has changed given it can't really.<br /><br />I'd suggest buying this if you have a bluray player otherwise just considering buying the DVD alone if you can find it.
0515141429|4.0|Having read several of the more recent books featuring Jack Reacher, I decided to go back to the beginning and take the unread entries in the series one by one in order, starting with the Killing Floor.  In this book, Child introduces Jack Reacher, former military policeman and currently meandering soul.  As the story opens, Reacher, having somewhat randomly gotten off a bus in a small town in Georgia, is arrested for murder.  Although he is able to quickly demonstrate his innocence, he is pulled into the situation as an unexpected personal link to the crime is unveiled.  Reacher's personality has developed since this first book but the foundation is clearly set in the Killing Floor.  If, like me, you joined the series in the middle, I wholeheartedly recommend that you go back to where it all began.  You won't be disappointed.  Now, on to book #2.
B002OB9KPE|2.0|I preordered and waited with great hope for this CD. The Whirlwind is: formulaic, repetitive, plodding, in-your-face aggressively preachy, completely uninspired, even annoying and un-listenable at times (no, actually, often). Wow, how incredibly disappointing.  Did I mention that it is plodding, repetitive and uninspired?    Want to find some new prog rock in an excellent debut album, for comparative purposes? Search for \\"Paul Cusick\\" on the Googles (don't know if I can post a direct link). It is so good, I listened (the whole album can be reviewed for free), then paid for the download, and even supported this start-up artist with some extra money.    Whirlwind is now retired after 3 listenings. Cusick's \\"Focal Point\\" will be around for the long haul. It's everything Whirlwind was not.
B002QEXN2K|4.0|The more I listen to Battle Studies, the more that it grows on me. Continuum was an amazing album--I consider it my favorite album of all--and I loved the blues style that he incorporated. I was hoping that he would continue in that style, which I think lead to a small letdown when I first started listening to Battle Studies. After my first listen, however, I found myself playing this album more and more without realizing it. This album is laid-back throughout, but I find with each listen more and more intricate guitar and melody layered within each track. The best track in my opinion is \\"Friends, Lovers, or Nothing\\". Other standouts include \\"Edge of Desire\\", \\"War of my Life\\", and \\"Heartbreak Warfare\\". This album lacks the catchy radio-friendly pop song, and I would have enjoyed some amazing guitar work as on \\"Bold As Love\\". But I think in Battle Studies, Mayer didn't worry about producing a #1 single and instead concentrated on creating a great album as a whole. 3.5/5

B001FBSMW6|1.0|This is not creative genius, this is just bad. Keane has a lot of talent but seems to try to be following in Radiohead's footsteps where you change direction on your third album. After two really good albums they just decided to put out some trash and see who would notice, and who would think it's some kind of experimental genius.  Well, I noticed it was trash.  There's no inspiration in Perfect Symmetry whatsoever.  Save your money for the next effort by a talented band.
B002G1X350|2.0|This is not the same Leaves' Eyes that gave us the two masterpieces entitled \\"Lovelorn\\" and \\"Vinland Saga\\", both of which are in my top 25 albums of all time. This is Leaves' Eyes channeling one of their less-talented female-fronted dark metal brethren (which are too numerous to name). Everything just seems slightly off. The melodies are sloppy, the hooks either aren't there or are left to die, and the vocals mixed too low. \\"My Destiny\\" is the only track that comes close to what they've put out before. Let's hope this unfortunate release is just a temporary setback.
0882709194|1.0|Instead of packaging a book under an already existing title and using the 'intro' to blast the contents, why not just write your own book and be done with it? This is a silly attempt to get people to read religious propaganda, and not affording people the opportunity to decide for themselves whether they want to read that sort of thing by re-publishing an existing work of text with your own spin added is an insult to intelligence and hypocritical when added to the text in the back triumphing the contents inside as 'truth'. If your aim is to spread truth, don't do it by blatant dishonesty, misinformation, and attempting to mislead. This review is not meant to discredit religion itself, but rather to protect it from this type of negative association by ridiculing and treating with intolerance this kind of underhanded tactic.
0743277708|5.0|This is a great book. Everybody should read it. It doesn't matter how old you are. The only thing that matters is that you have a heart that's beating. I read this as an adult. I have read this to children. This is a great book for a family to gather around and read to each other.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|How do you revive a classic Sci Fi TV series with a devoted, loyal cult following that will crush you if you screw it up? Clearly you hire JJ Abrams to produce and direct.<br /><br />I consider myself somewhat of a Trekie. I've seen every episode of the original TV series...at least 3 times. I've seen each of the major motion pictures...at least twice. I've seen all of the spin off TV series and their respective motion picture spinoffs at minimum once. So, yeah, I'd say I'm a fan. And there are fans that DO NOT want their stuff messed with no matter what. After seeing Abrams' Star Trek, I can't believe that any loyal fan...even the preservationists...could be unhappy. But there are those that will just be impossible to please, evidenced by the fair amount of strong criticism in the review section of this page alone.<br /><br />I, on the other hand, am firmly in the camp of this-was-a-great-movie! Abrams and his cast pay homage to everything that made the original TV series a classic. The movie takes you back through time to some short segments about Kirk's and Spock's childhood, then quickly moves to and progresses from when the two board the Enterprise for their first times. And they are of course joined by the other primary characters from the original TV series.<br /><br />All of the characters attempt to channel a bit of the persona and dispositions of the original actors, and they do a terrific job combining the natures of the original characters with some modern day personality polish.<br /><br />Abrams version of Star Trek might rewrite some of what was solidly in place with years of Star Trek history, and that might indeed be what has a Tribble in the bonnet of some of the preservationists. But Abrams' version has mostly succeeded in revitalizing a series that was inevitable to be remade by someone. So to the preservationists I say, be very very happy that you got such a great movie that is such a tribute to Gene Roddenberry's vision.<br /><br />Star Trek 2009 has a lot action, a great cast, a fine story...I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish.<br /><br />My only problem with this movie is that it was too short. That's right...I said too SHORT. I'm usually complaining about how unnecessarily long Hollywood makes its movies these days. But if you watch the deleted scenes that are included on Disk 2 of the Blu Ray package, you actually learn stuff that would have enhanced the theatrical version of the movie had it not been cut out.<br /><br />One thing that won't be short is the life of the new franchise that Abrams has created. These are the MAIDEN voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Where no man has gone before. Jump on board this initial voyage of what I'm guessing will be many before Abrams is done.e story...I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish.

B001AVCFK6|1.0|Don't get me wrong - it's a great movie, loved it in the theater. - bought the 3 disc version for my husband, thinking the 3rd disc would be the regular dvd and we could watch it tonight, don't own blu-ray player or HD tvs yet (old ones aren't worn out and won't waste the $$ just to buy new).<br /><br />Get it home, OK, the 3rd disc is the digital copy to download to a PC, fine I'll download it to his 3 month old laptop, we can still watch it.  I've spent an hour and can't get it to work, the screen just keeps flipping around to the original page.  We have the latest version of Windows Media Player, I don't need to download it again, or re-boot, etc.  Everytime I get to the page to enter the code to download the digital version, it zooms back to the \\"DIGITAL\\" screen.<br /><br />Tried ITunes, same thing.<br /><br />Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Taking it back to the store tomorrow, send your digital copy into space!
B002HWRYJE|1.0|The acting was decent.  That is all that is good with this film.<br />First, I'm not a Star Wars fan or a Trekkie.  I've only seen Star Wars once or twice with my son, but still couldn't get over the similarities between these two movies.<br /><br />The entire film had so many Star Wars things that it was ridiculous. Bits and pieces were borrowed from Star Wars and used in the Star Trek flick.<br />The Enterprise doesn't go into warp drive, like the M. Falcon.  Hmmm...<br />We're seeing a drill that looks remarkably similar to the floating thing in Star Wars that Skywalker landed on.<br />Swords that fling out the way a light saber would.<br />The scene with Luke Skywalker fighting Vadar was redone as young Captain Kirk fighting Nero...Seriously the scenery was so similar they might have been using the same props.<br />Then there is young Spock flying back towards Kirk, kind of like Han Solo coming back.<br />The destroying of the Death Star, I mean Nero's mining ship.<br />Ummm, what else?  The space lasers, I mean phasers.  The original Enterprise didn't even have all that cool technology.<br />Why did they even bother?  It made a mockery of Star Wars and Star Trek.<br /><br />I'm not even going into the annoying time paradox issues.<br /><br />And of course the sexist fact that the only female main character is suppose to be a \\"star pupil\\" but really she's just sleeping with the professor and that's how she got on the Enterprise.

B000J5NXLY|5.0|Simple and easy to use analogue light meter. It's not so great in low light, but under regular lighting conditions it's bang on and easy to use. I like the old style dial read-out. I use it when I'm shooting with my old Rolleiflex 2.8 E. The meter is small and easily tucked away in a pocket. The neck cord is long enough for extending the light meter out with the arm while it is around your neck.
B0017ANAZO|5.0|I already love the movie because it has Jada Pinkett in it and she is my favorite, although she is not seen throughtout the movie like the other cast members. This movie is a type of laid back movie that anyone can watch. It's not soft enough to be considered a chick flick, and certainly not hard enough to the point where all the boyz want to go and see it. I love the movie. It's comedy sure enough...I bought it used through Amazon and it arrived in 4 days of my ordering it.
B001AVCFJM|1.0|I have been a fan of STAR TREK since I was a small child watching it on TV and, by itself, this movie is good.  However, if you are a DIE HARD fan like me, YOU SHOULD THINK TWICE BEFORE WATCHING THIS.  What it did that really upset me was the fact that Leonard Nimoy/Spock comes back through time after a Romulan has done the same and already changed the past.  I thought all the way up to the end credits that they would fix this and put things right.  THEY DID NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Basically, it takes place between Star Trek: Enterprise and The Original Series.  Now, with the changes they made, EVERYTHING FROM THE OLD SERIES THROUGH THE NEXT GEN, DS9, VOYAGER, AS WELL AS THE FIRST 10 FILMS NEVER TAKES PLACE!!  Frankly, it'll take time for me to recover from this shock, assuming that I ever do.  I fear that I will never be able to watch any Trek again without this movie TAINTING Trek for me for the rest of my life.    IF YOU LOVE TREK AS MUCH AS I DO AND, LIKE ME, HAVE SEEN LITERALLY EVERY ONE EVER MADE, YOU REALLY SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE.  I hope and pray that they will have the sense to repair the damage they've done because I would label this one as a FRANCHISE KILLER.  If, as I suspect, they do not repair the damage done by film 11, I state now that STAR TREK IS officially and formally DEAD and BURIED now and forever.  Of course, the even numbered Trek movies have historically been the Great ones while the Odd Numbers were usually only passable.
B002HNA95E|5.0|I'm fairly new to Madonna, since I was born after she already was a superstar, but I've always loved the songs I've heard from her, new ones and older ones alike. Every song she lets out is really top notch. I've liked all the singles I'd her from her so far, but by the time I was able to buy music with my own money, Madonna was already on her Music/American Life albums. I was actually waiting for a greatest hits like this to try out her more and become acquainted with older Madonna songs, although I was a fan of a few of them already. When I heard the hot new song 'Celebration' I completely fell in love with it as it was so cool-sounding, upbeat and dance-friendly. Then I heard this song would be released in a 2-disc Madonna greatest hits compilation, so I thought \\"At last! My chance!\\" I bought the Celebration album as soon as I could, and once I heard all of the incredible tracks on it, I was completely amazed! This has got to be one of the best greatest hits compilations ever, but then again it comes from one of the best music icons ever as well! Every song is a Madonna classic, and sound amazing! Each hit will remember you a different era and you'll enjoy each track! The two new tracks, Revolver (featuring Lil' Wayne) and Celebration don't disappoint, 2 very hot new tracks, both single material in my opinion. After this album I've become more a Madonna fan and like to purchase her previous albums which I know contain even more classics. Buy this album if you're a Madonna fan or if you're new to her music. You won't regret it!
B001IF5YLQ|1.0|This item is not made by Apple.  It is a fake and does not say so in the listing!  I contacted the company and Amazon and got a refund after sending it back.  Amazon should do a much better job ensuring that the items listed on their site are correct.  This was a big waste of time.
B00008H2LB|1.0|In 2003, I bought this around the time it came out. I was still in 8th grade and didn't know music outside of the [radio] box at the time. Ironically, I bought this along with [[ASIN:B0000028RR Rage Against the Machine]] at the same time, and after so many years, only one of these albums is still in my CD collection. Take a guess.<br /><br />Upon first listen, I liked this. Not as much as [[ASIN:B00004Z459 Hybrid Theory]], but it was cool to hear new LP. Then, time came along, and with multiple singles getting radio treatment, this got old really quick, up to the point that my precious allowance money should have bought me something that lasts for longer than two spins.<br /><br />What is exactly wrong with this album? It's simple: this is just Hybrid Theory with a few minor tweaks. I could literally distinguish parallels between certain tracks. For example, \\"Don't Stay\\" is just \\"One Step Closer\\" but with more contrived anger. Then there's \\"Numb\\", which closes off the album the same way that \\"Pushing Me Away\\" did previously. I could go on with this, but let's be honest with the fact that Linkin Park have no imagination when it comes to their songwriting most of the time. Minus the instrumental \\"Session\\", you're given the same thing throughout, and when it's just beating the dead horse of Hybrid Theory, it's not very pleasant.<br /><br />\\"Meteora\\" is nothing but a soulless rehash of the band's previous formula, which wasn't that good in the first place. It's completely unimaginative and does nothing, and unless Hybrid Theory is one of your favorites, don't even bother with this empty shell.<br /><br />Score: 2/10

0786868724|4.0|\\"Have a Little Faith\\" is Mitch Albom's inspirational follow-up to his \\"Tuesdays With Morrie.\\" As such, it is fine, along the same track.<br /><br />He is asked by his former hometown (New Jersey) rabbi (Albert Lewis) to write his eulogy, so he accepts but wants to learn about the guy as a human being over a period of his final eight years of life. In the process he also comes in contact with a pastor (Henry Covington) in his recent hometown (Detroit) while reporting on a homeless shelter. In the process of learning more about each religious leader he gains insights about what faith is.<br /><br />Here are some things he learns in getting to know both men:<br /><br />1. Rituals are a major part of the rabbi's life. Faith is more about doing than believing. It is how from generation to generation we remain connected. Since faith hadn't meant much to Mitch, he would try to understand how it put the rabbi at peace. Even in retirement the rabbi kept a community, through his address book, by calling and sending emails for milestones - birthdays, anniversaries, etc. Even during times of horror/war you an find small acts of kindness. Be satisfied with simple things, the rabbi had learned from the Depression. People want to be known, hence there is immortality in being remembered. Mitch had learned from the rabbi that according to the Talmud, G-d didn't like Jews celebrating when the Egyptians died during the Exodus, because G-d loved their enemies too. When asking the rabbi how he knows there is a G-d, the rabbi says there is always something we can't understand and that's were G-d begins - the unknown. Mitch asks the rabbi if our nature is evil - nowhere in liturgy did G-d create bad things - we were left with free will.<br /><br />2. The pastor first felt faith while in jail after a life of crime, after first promising to G-d to change his life after nearly being killed during his crime years, then rising in the church ranks from elder to pastor. He wondered why he had been born and came across a biblical passage about Job cursing his birth. Even when cursing G-d when something bad happens there is even some confort to think G-d listened but said \\"No.\\" Throughout his life of crime he kept on getting second chances - he thought maybe G-d had punished him when his young daughter died. Better to have known the child even for a few short years than never at all, hence still some good. You are not your past. A life is made up of many lives - the most recent life is the most important. Forgiving is important - don't hold grudges - nothing haunts like things you don't say - loving thoughts. Mitch was able to understand the pastor best by talking to his congregants, what things he had done to help them. Mitch asked the pastor if he wanted to do better financially - he said he was meant to be with the poor.<br /><br />3. Mitch read about different religions as being connected to something big while doing something small.<br /><br />4. From both the rabbi and pastor he learned that people expect too much from marriage. Commitment is the most important part. Tribulations will occur (especially in the pastor's life), but getting past them is what makes the marriage endure.<br /><br />5. How can religions co-exist. Teaching that human life began with just one man, Adam, which produced all varieties - the genius of life is variety. - most religions teach to love your neighbor. As for the afterlife, just believing something exists is enough.<br /><br />6. The eulogy included Mitch's learning that different faiths can work side by side. It was 'majestic' that the rabbi could not speak at his eulogy - that's where faith comes in. It is a summary of memories where each of the congregants will have some while going back home. The whole purpose of Mitch during these eight years was not really the eulogy, but the journey to belief.<br /><br />In summary, Mitch delved into the lives of two religious leaders and came away with an understanding that the real fulfillment of a person is that one can improve if they have a little faith in something bigger than them.  The book is short and an easy read.faith in something bigger than them.  The book is short and an easy read.
B002T921AC|4.0|It is rare that the 'mature' listener is truly wooed to buy an artist under the age of say 21 because the 'maturity' factor is often lax.  Justin Bieber, obviously doesn't try to sing songs beyond his age, but the maturity that he executes them is quite prodigious for one who is only 15 years old.  From the first time I heard the Christopher \\"Tricky\\" Stewart produced \\"One Time\\", I knew that this 'tween' had something special.  With phenomenal pipes to back his 'squeaky clean' persona,  Bieber is destined to be a superstar.  These seven songs on [[ASIN:B002T921AC My World]] are a fine preview of what is to come on a full length Justin Bieber album and let me tell you folks, it is very promising.<br /><br />\\"One Time\\" was a brilliant choice for a first single that appeals to all ages.  The songwriting is catchy, the production sound, and Bieber's adolescent vocals are spot on.  Even more perfect, the producers (one being Usher) don't try to make Bieber out to be older than he is, which bows in his favor.  Follow-up \\"Favorite Girl\\" is equally infectious, though it never trumps the valedictory \\"One Time\\".  The ballad \\"Down To Earth\\" is a big song, but Justin handles it extremely well making it sound as convincing as the two mid-tempo jams that precede it.  \\"Bigger\\" is schmaltzy pop at its best, but as corny as it may be, it suits Bieber extremely well.  Even better is second single \\"One Less Lonely Girl\\", in which Bieber is paired with Stargate (at least that who it sounds like).  The Usher pairing \\"First Dance\\" is beautiful by all means and the production is among the best of the entire EP.  Closer \\"Love Me\\" ends the album on a fun note, again affirming that Bieber is indeed still a kid, but a kid who has a phenomenal talent.  Think back to Chris Brown's hit \\"Run It\\" when he was only 16.<br /><br />No quibbles here - I think Bieber is on the right track and his EP My World confirms that notion. 4 stars.

1416594787|5.0|I am a high school Biology teacher and was looking for some fresh ideas for presenting Evolution to my students. This book is great for that! Even though some of the book is above the academic level of the students, I have still been able to take numerous excerpts from the book to have my students critically analyze, and they love it.<br /><br />Very interesting, and sad, how many students think modern dogs such as Pugs and poodles were 'created' and have 'existed' since the beginning of time. That says a lot about the erroneous influences many students are 'taught' to believe.<br /><br />You'd be surprised, though maybe not, how many students say: \\"I had no idea evidence like this existed\\" or \\"I've never heard that before.\\" Comments like that only confirm my drive to educate people on the mounds of evidence that exists supporting the theory of Evolution. So sad that so many CHOOSE to ignore it.
B001GCUO16|5.0|I am a BIG fan of Blu-ray.  This is a great movie on Blu-ray.  A must.
B001AVCFK6|1.0|I've bought a handful of Blu-Ray movies in the past, even though I don't own a Blu-Ray player, because the package has always included a DVD disc along with a digital copy of the movie. This works out great because I can watch the movie on my DVD player, on my iPod Touch, and when I eventually upgrade to Blu-Ray, I can start using that disc. Naturally, I assumed a \\"3-Disc\\" edition would include just that: a Blu-Ray copy of the movie, a DVD copy, and a digital copy.    Nothing on the packaging indicates this is the case, so I cracked the plastic only to find I won't be able to watch this movie on my TV at all until I make some serious home theater upgrades.    I should have been more diligent in making sure the package included what I wanted, but the Amazon listing is ambiguous and the packaging itself doesn't indicate exactly what's inside. Caveat emptor, as always.    Note that the 1-star rating only indicates my dissatisfaction with the product listing -- I thought the movie was great and can't wait to watch it at home.
B002LL13BQ|5.0|Probably best, overall production, given singing, acting, staging, direction and sound.  I prefer the Australian version with Barker and Hobson for acting, sets and direction, but that version has marginal sound.  In contrast, this version with Stratus, Scotto and Carreras has all strong actors, singers in principal roles, with Zeffirelli sets and direction with no weaknesses.

B00064MW6K|3.0|Perhaps the weak plot, the hackneyed characters and the stiff dialogue were factors in the common opinion that this was one of the worst superhero movies of its time but 'Catwoman' is not without its selling points either. Here are some:    1. Halle Berry looks good in a tight cat suit.  2. Lambert Wilson gets to play a snooty and unscrupulous executive...which is a bit of a stretch for him, right? Right? ...oh.  3. The DVD makes a good drink coaster so you won't get rings on your coffee table.  4. If you ever get stranded at sea, the reflective DVD can be used to signal passing ships.  5. If you don't own a protractor, the DVD can be used to trace a perfect circle.  6. For the price of one penny, \\"Catwoman\\" is an affordable purchase in todays tough economy.  7. Too few superhero movies have any appeal to cat lovers but not THIS one.  8. Provides proof for the theory that Sharon Stone can only be killed by falling off a skyscraper.  9. Willy Wonka might have hidden a \\"Golden Ticket\\" in the Catwoman DVD you buy.  10. Halle Berry looks good in a tight cat suit.

0767821629|5.0|Of all the \\"Surprise! Reality is not what you think it is\\" films that came out around this time, the Thirteenth Floor seemed to slip under the radar while movies like \\"the Matrix\\" that had bigger actors and more special affects seemed to get all the attention. This is unfortunate because 13th Floor was well-written and had great character development, and although the plot twist was mildly predictable, the story itself is more than enough to carry its own weight. If you like your sci-fi movies to go a little deeper than mere eye candy, give this one a try.    \\"Because of superstition there is no 13th floor in buildings but come on...people on the 14th floor know what floor they're REALLY on...\\" - Mitch Hedberg
B002IYEQR4|3.0|I read the book for the first time about six months ago and really enjoyed it.Waited to buy the ultimate cut.It was okay.Im used to this already.Movies just cant detail what a book can.The only movie that did was The Godfather.
B001GQSY5K|1.0|To put this in perspective,I have always been the one to defend the prequels after it became trendy to criticize them but I have to draw the line at this particular cinematic travesty.<br /><br />At best, the storyline reads like amateur fan fiction but to be fair, it has potential to keep small children occupied for a while. The action sequences were reasonably entertaining but unfortunately, I was too distracted by the painful dialogue to thoroughly enjoy them. If a movie that bears the iconic name of \\"Star Wars\\" has a need for comic relief, it could not come from a much more ridiculous source than assembly-line droids whose programming should not include personality of any sort, much less slow-witted ineptitude.<br />But the annoyance of the droids pales in comparison to that of the character of the young Padawan \\"Ahsoka Tano\\". From the word 'go', this alien brat exhibits an attitude that should have got her drop-kicked out of Jedi College a long time ago (in a galaxy far away). Her consistent backtalk and unwillingness to follow orders is difficult to picture being tolerated in any military organization but somehow she is given a free pass by the Jedi masters, and recalcitrant pre-teen girls will probably also find her quite inspiring. If 'The Clone wars' were an AT-AT walker, Ahsoko would be the snowspeeder tow-cable that brought it to its knees and crashed it.<br /><br />For any true and long-term fan of the Star Wars franchise, this movie is worth its weight in Rancor droppings. For the writers of this animated insult, perhaps Vader could suspend Boba Fetts \\"no disintegrations\\" restriction...
0345455681|5.0|This is a fantastic book to read if you fell asleep during those dull history lessons but are still fascinated by the subject.  I have read all of the reviews and I agree with a lot of what people said about this book.  Yes.  This style is very much like Michener.  No. It probably isn't quite as absorbing as Micheners Hawaii.  But wow,  it does a great job of covering the evolution of London and puts all those kings and queens into context.  It paints a picture of what life could have been like, and how values changed through the generations, and why a lot of the places and streets have such odd names.  The one thing I think the book missed was a section at the end summarizing which parts are known to be accurate and which parts are fiction.  I can understand why some reviewers didn't like how some periods felt a little rushed, but that is a testament to how absorbing the book is.  It is plenty long enough already.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|J.J. Abrams does a remarkable job of keeping the 1960's series flavor and booting it well into the 21st Century. The actors do an excellent job of keeping the characteristics and mannerisms of the original series while ramping up the attitude. The plot line is less civic minded than the original, but makes up for it in action. Never mind that Kirk hangs from a precipice by his fingers at least 3 times, he takes the original Kirk's willingness to go where angels fear to tread to a level that would have even the demons (in this case, Romulans) taking a step back. Spock finally has a depth behind his stoic face that doesn't make the viewer cringe when his emotions do get the better of him.<br /><br />If you're a Trekkie, you'll love this film. If Steel Magnolias is your venue - stay away from this! If you are a right-wing, \\"original series is the only Trek\\" fan, you'll probably concede this was \\"okay.\\"  If, however, you're a sci-fan, and action film fan, or a summer blockbuster fan you're going to love this film.<br /><br />\\"Buckle up!\\"

Maybe the songwriting is a bit better.  maybe it just came out at the right time.  I don't know, but this is as good as and so much more fun than the original.  These are all songs that lodge in your noggin and will not leave.  This is, along with the rest of the BooH series, a must have in your collection.  It's just a great romp.
B002NXSRX4|4.0|I had heard a lot of bad stuff about G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra and it was, for the most part, a bad rap. Sure, it wasn't set back in the 60's when G.I. Joe was founded, but World War 2 and Vietnam movies have been done to death. So, it was refreshing to see them take G.I. Joe in a completely different direction. The future. With new weapons, new technology and new faces.<br /><br />Sure the script has been criticized as being non-existent and smothered by action sequences and special effects. Yet, G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra is by far, a more creative and involving story than many actions movies of recent, as in, anything by Roland Emmerich, Twilight movies or whatever. It actually is a fast and furious pace with an actually very complicated story. That to me, was the problem. Because the fast and furiuos pace would brush over the story elements with a very thin brush and so when the ending finally got there, there were way too many loose ends and they all seemed to come pouring down in the final 3 minutes.<br /><br />They could have slowed down and made the story elements more important, but all in all, what you get with G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra is an energetic, cyber-weapon summer flick that gave people what most summer movie viewers want, slam bam action with cool effects.<br /><br />If anything, G.I. Joe tried to do TOO MUCH story, and didn't cover all of it or give it justice because they were more interested in pleasing the teenage crowd that buys the tickets. People like me, a 40-year old male who likes that stuff too, but would rather save his money to get by on bills, enjoyed the heck out of it in his living room with some surround sound and some Orville Redenbacker.

This cd will surely scare the bejeesus out of kids of all ages or anyone with any musical sensibilities. Give the sound engineer's credit for getting through the obviously torturous chore of recording this mess. One has to wonder at what point did they proclaim \\"You nailed it Bob, that's a wrap!\\" This makes Stevie Nicks' rendition of \\"Silent Night\\" sound like an angel singing.

B002I6251G|4.0|When I first heard that Editors were putting aside their strings for keyboards, I thought two things.  First, I hoped that this was not the destination for them, but rather a progression of the brilliant discography they started 5 years ago.  In other words, I didn't want them to see themselves as going from Joy Division to New Order and then stopping there.  They are just trying something new.  The other thing I thought was, \\"I hope they don't embarrass themselves.\\"    Well, they don't.  They are not trying to be New Order, Depeche Mode, Kraftwerk, or any other 1980s synth-pop band.  This is still an Editors album.  And they don't just get through a bunch of songs without their guitars.  They manage to pull off some surprises and dramatic musical departures.      The band says they had to do this in order to produce a third studio album on-time (which for them was year-end 2009).  So they motivated themselves to do different things.  And then they increased their chance of success by hiring Flood to produce the album.  Flood's presence really makes itself felt on the fifth track, The Big Exit, which has a 'no-wave' guitar intro straight out of an early 1970s Brian Eno record (Another Green World, actually).  Guitars are present from time to time on tracks like the title track, 'Papillon', 'The Boxer', 'Like Treasure', and 'Human' (on the 'Cuttings II' bonus disc), and when they are heard, they have that Flood feel to them (think 1990s U2 or Smashing Pumpkins, only distant or muted).    Listing to the album a few times through now, it occurs to me that 'Like Treasure' is the brightest song on the album, and it comes close to sounding like Coldplay without being obvious.  Again, this album is full of moments like that.  You know where the influences are from, but the compositions succeed in being original based on the sum of their ingredients.  The Editors take bits and pieces of 30 years of UK rock and make it all their own.    This is a solid album for Editors, noless enjoyable or interesting than their previous two.  But certainly different.  Apparently they want to work with Flood again, so we shouldn't be surprised if their next album in 2011 or 2012 is also synth-dominated.      Overall, this is a slightly darker album for Editors (keep in mind their first two were fairly dark to begin with).  It is meant to be a late night London album - a simple but appropriate theme for them.  Subtle and direct references to London appear throughout and are both highlighted and bookended by the opening and closing tracks.  I think theme-wise, the ordering of the tracks couldn't be more perfect.  Editors seemed to have sweated the details because they care about what an album is supposed to be.  Dying medium or not, Editors are committed to making good albums.    Perhaps the band had to go this route.  They did it not only to prove they are capable of setting a new goal and achieving it - but to prove that they are going to be with us for a while.  If they reach a fifth album, and bring back their trademark distorted rhythm guitars, they will have completed a 10-year cycle most other bands fail to achieve.      The Editors always seem tip their hats to greater artists that have come before (mainly the giants of the 80s New Wave).  But with each full album, they are becoming great themselves.  Let's see where they go next.

B001EOQWF8|5.0|What a wonderful movie. I really didn't know quite what to make of the previews, I mean, very little dialogue to be heard, and the main leads were robots. After seeing the film, I love it. The lack of dialogue is actually a bonus, as you focus on the mannerisms and actions, however small, of the main characters, Wall-e and Eve. Visually the movie is stunning. The vistas of a barren Earth are amazing and desolate. Space is an incredible sight as well, with the best space travel scenes since Star Wars. The story has a superb point to it as well, as the eco-friendly message is very timely and to the point without being preachy. Wall-e's yearning for companionship is palpable, expressed in his repeated attempts to simply hold Eve's hand. Pixar continues to do the near-impossible, hold your attention and make you feel empathy and affection for robots and machinery. There hasn't been this sympathetic and lovable a robot character in a film since R2-D2 in Star Wars. The attention to detail is amazing. Everything is extremely well-thought out and designed. The growth and development of Pixar's art is incredible. They tell the best stories, with the absolute best in animation, on the most consistant basis. No-one can do it better, as their track record will attest. The ending is superb, with enough emotional sentimentality to catch you, without being too overdone. All in all, this is a fine film, one of the best films of the year. It certainly deserved the best animated feature oscar it received, and I think it deserved a best picture nomination as well, as it presented a timely message with enough humour and emotion to get the point across. Get this fine film and be carried away to another point in space with Wall-e.
B0017VG66I|4.0|Two westerns based on literary classics, Dorothy Johnson's short story \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\" and  Jack Schaeffer's novel \\"Shane.\\" Both stories date from the 1940s and are attempts to raise the western a notch or two above the shoot-em-up conventions of pulp fiction. The originals, I will argue, are better than the films, and given the strength of the films, that's giving 5 stars to Johnson and Schaeffer.<br /><br />Johnson's story is an ironic portrayal of Old West heroism. An all around top cowboy, who compares well with Owen Wister's Virginian, saves the life of a lawyer newly arrived from the East, who wants to practice law in a land where law is chiefly administered at the point of a gun. In attempting to bring the outlaw Liberty Valance to justice, he is drawn into a shoot-out that the experienced gunfighter is sure to win. Surprisingly, the reverse happens, and years later the young lawyer rises to prominence as a politician, while the cowboy is a has-been, having outlived his time. He also loses his girl to the lawyer.<br /><br />In Schaeffer's novel, homesteaders are in conflict for the right to their land with a cattleman trying to drive them off. A gunfighter comes to their rescue, and Schaeffer portrays the unlikely coming together of a hard-working nuclear family and a mysterious stranger whose skill with a gun saves them and makes way for the same civilization that turns the tables in Johnson's story. Old West makes way for the New West, all with the help of someone good with a gun.<br /><br />Though strong and probably forever deemed \\"classic,\\" both films have their drawbacks. While John Wayne and James Stewart are their recognizable selves in \\"Liberty Valance,\\" and Lee Marvin delivers yet another of his wonderful portrayals of villains doomed to die spectacularly, Wayne and Stewart at least are far too old for their parts. Each should be at least 20 years younger to faithfully play the young men who appear in Johnson's version. The woman torn between them, played by Vera Miles, who is otherwise fine, should also be correspondingly younger. One other quibble - the film was shot in large part at the studio, either on the backlot or on a sound stage. It's easy to miss the grand landscapes that usually accompany a John Ford film.<br /><br />The movie \\"Shane,\\" meanwhile, has other problems. Alan Ladd plays an endearingly warm and friendly, not to say honorable, gunfighter. Jack Schaeffer's original conception of the character is significantly different. The Shane of the book is more potentially dangerous in his appearance - dressed in dark colors and a black hat. He's supposed to be able to put a chill through you. His impact on all three members of the family is far more complex and nuanced as a result - especially the attraction that builds between Shane and the wife, Marian. This is all treated in a more PG-rated fashion in George Stevens' film version. Another quibble - the story itself is dwarfed by the grandiose view of Wyoming's Tetons, where Stevens chose to shoot the exteriors. Novelist Schaeffer set his family's homestead on the prairie east of the Big Horns - where undistracted by the view, the drama played out among them takes on more stature. Finally, Brandon DeWilde's young Joey is less than perfect for the role - maybe too young, maybe misdirected, but lacking the presence and the depth that he has in the novel.<br /><br />But, any true western fan is going to overlook these shortcomings. Especially enjoyable is the crisp, black and white, widescreen print of \\"Liberty Valance,\\" a film absolutely made for the big screen. And at 2 for one, this double bill is a great bargain.d by Vera Miles, who is otherwise fine, should also be correspondingly younger.

0547258305|4.0|This is my second reading of \\"Graceling\\" and I found myself enjoying it probably even more than when I read it the first time. I am once again convinced that Cashore is a very talented writer with a great future ahead of her.<br /><br />\\"Graceling\\" is Cashore's first novel and what a great debut it is! Now, having read her second book \\"Fire,\\" I know that she is developing as a writer in many ways. This particular book is very imaginative, the idea of Graces is original (at least to me) and intriguing - I especially enjoy the fact that the Graces are never what they appear to be at first. They are complex and ever evolving. I also appreciate Cashore's writing style - it is simple, concise, but yet very descriptive and emotional.<br /><br />What greatly frustrates me about Cashore's writing, and the main reason I find it impossible for myself to give her books 5 stars, is ultimate weakness of her heroines (both Katsa and Fire) and their strange and obsessive attitudes toward marriage and children. Katsa is supposedly an independent woman who wants nobody to take care of her. I understand this desire for independence very well. For the longest time I myself refused idea of marriage and I don't have kids, but even I find Katsa's unyielding desire to never marry or to commit strange. There are never any reasons given why she feels so and it appears to be just a baseless fancy of hers. The saddest thing about this book is definitely the epilogue. It seems so strange to me that Katsa even after all her adventures and all the proof of Po's love and devotion to her, still chooses to do \\"as she pleases\\" - to go about her business leaving Po behind to be her occasional lover, to make sure she does not \\"stop him from loving anyone else.\\" I can't stop myself from asking - is this really love? to go as you please and leave the man you love to look for someone else to love? is this really love to make your own choices without factoring in your partner and your partner's wishes in your plans for the future? is this love when you decide what will happen in your life and your partner settles for anything you can give him, no matter how little it is? My answer is \\"no.\\" I am not propagating marriage here in any way, but I do feel that Katsa at the least is insecure and doesn't trust Po's love for her and at the most is selfish in her petulant decision to stay her own woman by refusing any claim Po can possible have on her (be that a wife or a life partner). I fail to understand why Katsa thinks that marrying Po or committing herself to him fully would ever put constraints on her independence? And how long such relationship can last while Katsa is being her own woman and encouraging Po to go around looking for someone else to love?<br /><br />In the end, I just feel that Cashore here lost an opportunity to show Katsa's emotional growth. I don't mean that marriage to Po would have proven her to be a better person, but the ability to fully commit and to surrender to and to trust her partner, certainly would. In my eyes, Katsa starts her journey being scared of trusting people and fearful of commitment, and ends it without changing in any significant way. It makes me sad for her, because in real life people stuck on their fancyful but unexplainable trust issues, fail their relationships over and over again. Cashore tries to portray Katsa's decision as a triumph of her independence, but for me it is merely an indication of a victory of Katsa's fears over her life experiences.<br /><br />Katsa and Po will appear in Cashore's next book \\"Bitterblue\\" and I am very curious to see where she is planning to take their relationship. I wish them happiness, but with current attitude of Katsa's I simply don't see it happening.<br /><br />I understand that this rant might seem like a petty nitpicking, but I guess I appreciate Cashore's writing too much to leave my personal feelings about this book unexpressed.your plans for the future? is this love when you decide what will happen in your life and your partner settles for anything you can give him, no matter how little it is?

Cashore tries to portray Katsa's decision as a triumph of her independence, but for me it is merely an indication of a victory of Katsa's fears over her life experiences.<br /><br />Katsa and Po will appear in Cashore's next book \\"Bitterblue\\" and I am very curious to see where she is planning to take their relationship. I wish them happiness, but with current attitude of Katsa's I simply don't see it happening.<br /><br />I understand that this rant might seem like a petty nitpicking, but I guess I appreciate Cashore's writing too much to leave my personal feelings about this book unexpressed.
0792163710|3.0|Given the post-war publication of Jack Schaefer's novel \\"Shane\\" and the early 1950's Hollywood adaptation by George Stevens, it's a bit easier to understand the immense popularity of the film at the time. Shane, the gunfighter, appears out of nowhere, befriends and eventually defends a frontier family, and then disappears again. In a way, he represents every returning soldier from the killing fields of WWII and Korea who needed to be reintegrated into the communities they came from. The difficulty of this process is reflected in Shane's hyper-vigilant behavior and unwillingness to talk about his past, in both the book and the film, which suggest a man more than a little afflicted with PTSD. So the coming together of the western-movie gunslinger and the peaceable nuclear family in this story was surely a way for audiences to understand in fictional form the real drama going on in so many of their personal lives. That the gunslinger disappears, the family is saved, and the next generation is now free to grow \\"strong and straight\\" must have been greatly reassuring.<br /><br />The original Shane in Schaefer's book is far more dangerous-looking and acting than Alan Ladd's warm and friendly portrayal of the man, dressed in buckskin and tan hat instead of the much darker outfit and black hat that the boy Bob, who narrates the book, describes. The original Shane also more deliberately refuses to wear his gun, a sign that he has a violent past to hide, while at the same time preventing another man from drawing on him. (Code of the West: never shoot an unarmed man.) As some have said already, Jack Palance would have been a better choice for the role - able to convey the more sinister aspect of the character conceived by Schaefer. But on the big screen, this would have given movie audiences a more troubling image, especially as the attraction builds between Shane and Marian. The erotic appeal of a dangerous man would have converted this family-friendly entertainment into something a bit different.<br /><br />Schaefer's original story (though not a long one) is aggressively telescoped to fit into 90 minutes of movie time, and it's also constricted by the conventions of the movie western. While the cattleman Ryker (aka Fletcher in the novel) doesn't make an appearance until half way through the novel, he and his cowboys come riding up in the opening scene of the film to begin making their threats to the Starrett family to get off their land. Shane's gun and gunbelt are on full display, where Joey can exhibit his open fascination with them, and Shane uses the gun to give a lesson to Joey in drawing and firing it. Schaeffer gives much less emphasis to firearms. When near the end there is a conflict between Joe Starrett and Shane about who will go to town to confront Ryker/Fletcher, Shane simply pistol-whips Joe, but true to the genre, there has to be a protracted fistfight between the two men in the film.<br /><br />Sacrificed are the many nuances Schaefer records in his rendering of the shifting relationships among his central characters - the male-bonding of the two men, the emotional attachment of Marian to Shane, and the hero worship in the boy Bob, who is torn in his admiration for his father and this friendly stranger. Lost, too, is the character of Chris, a young cowboy (played well but by a somewhat older Ben Johnson in the film), whom Shane reluctantly subdues in a fight and who appears at the Starretts after the shoot-out in the saloon, offering to work as Joe's hired hand. It's a touching moment which shows the maturation of a character who has been awed by the integrity and honesty of Joe and Shane. The film, of course, ends before this, with the iconic scene of Joey calling out as his hero rides off, \\"Shane, come back!\\"<br /><br />Schaefer also set his story in the Powder River region of Wyoming, south of Sheridan, within sight of the Big Horns. This is Johnson County, site of the well-known \\"wars\\" between cattlemen and rustlersin 1892. Stevens, wanting a more picturesque location, went to the area around Jackson, within sight of the much grander Tetons, in western Wyoming. A small matter, maybe, but it demonstrates how historical accuracy in movie westerns is typically neglected for the sake of cinematic effect.<br /><br />Wrapping up here, I have to give the film only 3 stars. While working well as a kind of time-capsule of the early 1950s, it seems dated fifty years later. The novel has stood up much better with time. I encourage readers to give it a try.re picturesque location, went to the area around Jackson, within sight of the much grander Tetons, in western Wyoming.

B002NPUCIA|5.0|YES! Brian,the producer,the composer,the musician,the MAN!,has presented us with a live compilation of some of our favorite music.The best thing about this compilation,is the \\"LIVE STUDIO RECORDING\\" DVD. For me,it's far better than a concert.The camera puts you in the studio and you get to see the expressions of the musicians as they play the music and also interact to the music and each other as they play.Because they're not playing before an audiance/fans,they don't have to put on a performance/entertain.They simply paly the music and really VIBE off each other.Eric Darius and the band played so funky,they made that whiteboy (TERM-OF-ENDEARMENT)dance.He seemed so free, humble and happy. I caught myself smiling and grinnin throughout the show.I was thouroughly ENTERTAINED by what I viewed.Brian Culbertson is \\"THE MAN\\".This compilation is Simply AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!money well spent.I actually bought an adictional copy to share with a distant friend and fan.<br />It is stated in the liner notes that this project is dedicated to the fans . . .<br />I thank him for giving something back/expressing his gratitude and appreciation.

0765356139|3.0|With this book, THE WELL OF ASCENSION (WOA), Brandon Sanderson continues his MISTBORN trilogy. Unfortunately, unlike MISTBORN, this novel came across as more of a chore than a cheer. Here's my take on it . . .    STARTING FROM SCRATCH (FOR THE MOST PART)    Let's face it, the previous book, MISTBORN, could have nearly been a stand-alone novel. Towards its conclusion most of the plot threads had been tied up--the Lord Ruler defeated, the skaa freed, and Vin/Valette gets to hang out with Elend. About the only thing that didn't get resolved in that novel was this: What about the Mist that is still floating around the world?     As a result, WOA starts off with a situation that, while plausible, comes across as forced simply \\"for sequel's sake\\". WOA starts off with the now-free city of Luthadel facing an army outside its gates. This army is led by a nobleman (Straff Venture) that chose to leave the city in the previous book. More armies come to lay siege to Luthadel and all are led by characters who previously had small roles.    THE SADLY SLOW SEQUEL    You would think that a newly-freed city being threatened by three armies would make for quite the page-turner.   Not quite.   Sadly, a lot of time in WOA is spent just waiting for something to happen. For the vast majority of the novel, the armies do nothing but sit there, Elend Venture learns how to be a king and Vin grows a little distrustful and kills off numerous nameless assassins (which didn't pose that much of a threat anyway. To paraphrase Austin Power's father: \\"You don't even have a name tag! You've got no chance!\\")    At the beginning of the book there are a couple of maps. One of Luthadel and one of The Final Empire. Part of the reason why I think this book dragged so slowly is because the vast majority takes places in and immediately around Luthadel. There are two small excursions in the Final Empire taken by Marsh & Sazed and Vin & Elend, but that's all.  Reading about characters cooped up in a city is about as exciting as watching a movie that has only one set-piece or background--a little more variety would be nice.     DEJA VU    As I pointed out in my earlier review of MISTBORN, this series is basically ELANTRIS turned into a trilogy. Both ELANTRIS and the MISTBORN trilogy have a great deal in common. So much, in fact, that Deja Vu is almost guaranteed. In WOA, the scene with the Well of Ascension reminded me heavily of the ending of ELANTRIS.     SAVING GRACES    As much negative I've said about this current volume, there are some good things about it. One of the new characters, TINDWYL, quickly became one of my favorites, especially when she was advising Elend on the matters of \\"how to be a king\\".   Brandon Sanderson focuses alot more on religion, philosophy and prophecy than most other fantasy authors I've read, and he often has some very interesting things to say about them. In general, the way he draws parallels between Alendi and Vin is very well done.   Finally, like most novels, the last hundred pages are a quick and satisfying read, full of plot-twists and revelations.     OVERALL    Although not on par with his previous book, WOA kept me interested just enough to keep reading to the end. Also unlike the previous book, WOA ends leaving many things unanswered, paving a more obvious way for a sequel than MISTBORN did.  A sequel that I am definitely looking forward to.

So everyone quit your whining and get over it. If you wanted the normal display formats, then you should have got a PC. The price is the price, if you want the usual very high Apple quality then you get what you pay for, a solid adapter that does exactly what it's supposed to do.

B00020HEL6|3.0|I recently received my copy of \\"Renee Olstead\\" after a recommendation from a friend. The recording quality throughout is excellent. Renee sings with a maturity well beyong her years and is reminiscent of the old Jazz ladies we all know. On most tracks the singing technique is excellent and I much preferrred the slower numbers which leave less room for improvisation. Which is why I preferred these. But Renee falls into the trap of messing with the tune, and breaking into too much fiddly improvisation. She is not the first, as I find that many Jazz/Blues vocalists don't seem to resist the temptation to drift off into some strange skatty thing. So much so that they, and Renee lose the melody and could be singing anything.  I like the sound of Renee's voice and her singing ability so much that I would love an album of standards left without all the vocal experimentation. I notice the wonderful Nora Jones has gone off into some Rock/Funk world and frankly no longer sounds much like Nora Jones. I fear Renee will mix it up too much as she is influenced by outsiders.  Renee needs to listen to a Julie London standards collection to see what I mean. Frank Sinatra always sounded  like Frank Sinatra and you always knew what he was singing. That's why he lasted. It works. Pick a style and song type and stick to it.  Buy it nevertheless and enjoy her sound and the ability she demonstrates to keep pace and rythmn. Overall an opportunity lost.

I wish I hadn't waited even a day. Although I am blessed to currently be healthy, and I have no close family or friends who have ever had strokes, I still found this book, literally, life changing. It has completely changed my perspective and outlook on the world. Dr. Taylor is a secular saint as far as I am concerned and we are blessed to hear her message.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|The 'holy scripture' of recorded music, the Beatles catalog has finally received the right treatment. Even though the remastered mono box set is also an absolute must-have, I still feel that the stereo remastered box set is the ultimate in music.    In this review, I'll focus on the sound quality, as it is the absolute selling feature of this set (yes, the presentation/packaging is also nice, but it contributes only 0.001% of the overall lure). And of course, the quality and the significance of the Beatles music has been discussed to no end, so I'll keep that aspect at the minimum here.    Let me start by saying that the sound quality on these CDs is to die for. As a matter of fact, I'd be hard pressed to find a better sounding CD in my vast collection (the one that does come to mind is Mike Oldfield's 'needle drop' remaster of his original 1974 \\"Hergest Ridge\\" CD). There is an unmatched sweetness of the sound that oozes from many tracks off many of these CDs. I'm not sure what was it that the remastering team did to these CDs, but they've definitely managed to imbibe a lot of musicality and just overall sweetness in the sound that is packed on these CDs.    And, as I've noted in the title of this review, this is exactly how I feel music should sound when reproduced on a home stereo system. It should sound full-bodied, punchy, lucid, present, well rounded, sweet, non-harsh, and yet at the same time in-your-face. These CDs bring all these qualities in troves. They are indeed worth every penny.    Some people feel that these remasters sound as good as I've just described them only on a high-end audio system. And while I am indeed using an esoteric, hand built high end audio system for reviewing these remastered, I should also hasten to add that I've first heard some of the remastered tracks on a crappy Starbucks sound system on September 9, 2009, when I was visiting Manhattan with my wife. And even then, I fell off my chair when I heard \\"Thank You Girl\\". The presenceof John's and Paul's vocals was cutting though even on a crappy Starbucks sound system, despite the ambient noises coming from the espresso grinders!    I knew right then and there that the engineers had managed to do wonders with the Beatles catalog. Needless to say, I rushed out and bought the remasters on the spot.    Tons of digital ink have already been spilled describing the improvements these remasters have brought in terms of deeper, warmer, punchier bass, as well as snappier drums (especially Ringo's snare drum). And while I agree with these assessments, I still am convinced that the biggest victories have been won on the vocal front. Where I hear the biggest improvements is in the way John's, Paul's and George's voices are now cutting through. On many remastered tracks, you can now literally see the vocalists as if they are physically singing in your room. The clarity of the vocal delivery is beyond amazing, it is simply magical.    One thing you will notice on these remastered tracks is how careful the Beatles were (and especially John Lennon) with pronouncing each and every consonant while singing. You can now hear very clearly how meticulous John was when signing the word 'world' (for example, when singing \\"Revolution\\"); pay attention to how he goes out of his way to pronounce 'd' at the end of the 'worlD'. It's uncanny!    Many other exciting, even exhilarating discoveries await you as you may listen though this remastered catalog. Another startling discovery will be in the percussion area. You'll hear amazing dynamic range that a simple instrument, such as tambourine, can deliver on tracks such as \\"Day Tripper\\", \\"You've Gotta Hide Your Love Away\\", \\"Norwegian Wood\\", \\"Hey Jude\\" etc.    You will also be startled by the electro shocks you'll now hear when listening to the guitar solos on \\"Got To Get You Into My life\\", \\"Good Morning Good Morning\\", \\"Taxman\\", and so on. The electric guitar now truly leaps out of the speakers, you can reach out and touch it,it is so three-dimensional on these remastered tracks.    Oddly enough, there are several tracks, few and in-between, where it is getting difficult to detect any improvements. I don't know how to explain that phenomenon, seeing how most of the material delivers such a phenomenal, incomparable improvement. A surprising example would be \\"I Am The Walrus\\". I was expecting to be bowled over by the remastered version, but my listening experience didn't reveal much difference. there are several other tracks where I failed to detect significant improvements. Overall, however, these are very few and in-between, and thus cannot affect the overall glorious improvements.    Other good news is that these remastered tracks have not succumbed to the egregious 'loudness wars', which means that it is now very easy to do a comparative listen between the remastered stere and mono tracks. They are almost always at the same, or similar loudness level (very surprisingly, many of the mono remasters sound a bit louder than their stereo counterparts). This is great, as we don't have to level-adjust the volume when we want to skip from a mono version of the song to the stereo version, and vice versa. I find these back-to-back comparative listens very revealing, as I'm now learning more about the Beatles esthetics and what the four lads were considering worthy of releasing to the audience. Many of the mono versions sound a bit more compact than the stereo version, but many mono tracks do lose some of the musical details in favor of presenting a coherent picture.    My biggest shock came when comparing stereo \\"Paperback Writer\\" to the much more famous mono version. I was expecting the mono version to wipe the floor with the stereo version, but to my ears, the stereo version somehow delivers more punch than the mono does. This despite the prevailing lore of the urban legend which claims that the definitive version of this song is mono.    Same goes, to a certain extent, with the mono Sgt. Pepper's. Urban legend would have you believed that you haven't lived until you've experienced the mono Pepper. But to my ears, stereo Pepper still sounds better and delivers more punch and color. For example, the mono version of \\"Sgt. Pepper's Reprise\\" carries almost cartoonish vocals, while the stereo version really rocks the house!    In conclusion, I think every household must have this stereo box set, as this is indeed the best conceived, composed, executed and recorded music on the planet. And now with the refurbished and remastered sound, it truly delivers the sweetest, most angelic sounding music ever recorded! Run and buy this box, if you haven't already. then, after you've experienced all the greatness it contains, think some more about acquiring the mono version of the same catalog, since it also contains some additional details and sweetness not necessarily found in the stereo set.

B002LFIZDG|5.0|Geeky , polite and as sweet as two 6-month old babies , the Kings Of Convenience have won a special place in the hearts of their fans not only for their gentle melodies but also for the wonderful wonderful friendship they display on stage and during interviews . The norwegian Simon & Garfunkel as they are often called , their latest offering \\" Declaration Of Depedence \\" comes five years after their sophomore release \\" Riot In An Empty Street \\" and remains faithful to their already established sound .. which is a good thing !    It's amazing how rich a sound two acoustic guitars and two voices can produce . The mood here varies from happy ( \\" Boat Behind \\" ) to melancholic ( \\" Me In You \\" ) to zen-like ( the hypnotic \\" Scars On Land \\" ) while the band gives it's listeners lyrics that can be heartbreakingly beautiful ( \\" ...dreams burn but in ashes are gold \\" ) or in other occasions , playful and witty ( \\" we got four eyes so why yearn for one prespective ?.. \\" they ask , celebrating freedom of thought ) .     This might not be anybody's thing . Rebelious teenagers for example would probably seek for something angrier . This doesn't change the fact though that this is top quality songwritting . People who have enjoyed current pop folk artists before , people who cherished the work of let's say , Tracy Chapman , Suzanne Vega , Feist ofcourse , Jens Lakeman , Jack Johnson and Josh Rouse , will be delighted with this piece of music so well-crafted as an antique classic violin .

0385504225|2.0|While I enjoyed \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\", it is clear from his newest work that he has become his own cliche. Throughout the story, the \\"ticking time bomb\\" is an impending threat against national security, requiring the intervention of CIA Black Ops. But when the details of the threat are finally revealed to the reader near the end of the book, it turns out that at worst, it's a public relations scandal for a few politicians. Nothing criminal by any means.     Much of the story revolves around protagonist Robert Langdon running around an historic city with a woman in tow trying to decipher symbolic clues imbedded in architecture and artwork from an antiquated and secretive organization. It's the same formula his previous Langdon novels use. This time, instead of the Catholic Church or the Knights Templar/Priory of Scion, the organization in question is the Order of Freemasons.     There is a lot of New Age/New Thought philosophy and theology dumped on the reader in classic Dan Brown style, but more heavy-handed this time. A mashup between \\"Da Vinci Code\\" and the movie \\"What the Bleep\\" might sound promising, but it falls flat in this novel.

No matter who you are or what you have been through, or not been through, read this book!  The insights are priceless.

(For the record, I think it's unfair to hold it against the film-makers if your very young child was upset...those ratings are given for a reason. It's up to parents to pay attention to the rating and use their common sense.) There's plenty of fun and adventure here for both children and adults.<br /><br />The most fun I've had watching a movie in a long, long time!

At one of the greatest moments in comic book history his film-that was so true to a book that most of us who love it were willing to forgive dry acting and flat delivery of Allan Moores lines- completely CHANGED the end, blasted out one of the best points to ever be made in a comic series by making Dr Manhattan the cause of the earths cities destruction!!! Its no wonder Allan Moore didnt want his name attached to this project. There are so many things wrong with this change and so many questions it raises, especially since Americas enemies believed Dr Manhattan an American trick- there by negating the whole united front perspective. Ugh it was like eating the greatest meal of your life and then finding a cockroach in the last bite. If anything it will hopefully show Hollywood, as Iron Man 1 has, that the CLOSER u make these films to the books, the better they are. Good movie but the ultimate insult to real hardcore fans. So can the whole best adaptation reviews please.
061891868X|5.0|I am not a theoretical physicist, I am in fact a biologist, but Lee Smolin's book \\"The Trouble With Physics\\" immediately struck a chord.  I have been interested in physics as lay person, especially relativity, quantum theory and astrophysics, and occasionally read books on the subject.  This book especially stood out as I think that some aspects of biology have also been hijacked into unproductive paths which like string theory seem to have lives of their own.  Beside the physical world by necessity impinges on and in fact encompasses the biological world.  Thus physical theory is important to biologists at a fundamental level.<br /><br />Smolin has finally put an end to the pretense that string theory, as it now stands, actually is science.  While some discrete string theories (he says that there are ten to the 500th distinct string theories, or more than the number of atoms in the known universe) have been tested (all so far have been falsified), most of the rest are not yet described in a way that can be tested. String theory thus becomes like the existence of God- a unscientific problem.  Yet people working on string theory are getting grants and advancing in their careers, while other physicists following possibly more fruitful lines of research get nowhere.<br /><br />The questions that need to be answered in physics are probably not going to be answered by string theory and in fact some researchers in string theory (but by no means all) look to me like some of the researchers working on the malaria vaccine.  They are pulling in grant money that could be used better elsewhere to do essentially nothing.<br /><br />This book is indeed an eye opener about the so-called purity of science.  Scientists are people like other people and some are good at what they do while others are mediocre and a few even incompetent, delusional, self-serving or even criminal. The only thing that keeps scientists on the up and up are the principles that make good science depend on verification of theories with empirical evidence.  If an idea cannot be tested it is in fact not a scientific question.  Dependence on authority, tradition, or preconceived notions is simply not science.<br /><br />Smolin has reminded us of this fact and while I am not sure that his ideas about how to cure the problem in physics will work, his book is a much needed correction to the fad of string theory and its stifling effect on the science.  I recommend this book to anybody who is involved in or interested in any of the sciences.with empirical evidence.  If an idea cannot be tested it is in fact not a scientific question.

B0017R5UAA|5.0|Anyone who loves lo-fi - The Decemberists, Iron & Wine, Death Cab for Cutie, etc. - should get this album. I would say Fleet Foxes are closest to Iron & Wine (or Carissa's Wierd for those who've heard them) because while there are moments where the beat speeds up, it's never loud or \\"rock\\". It's more like baroque pop with the vocal harmonies combining with gentle string arrangements and flutes for a sound which is soothing and beautiful.    Fleet Foxes produces some great harmonies throughout this album, especially on \\"White Winter Hymnal\\", my favorite track. There are no tracks on here I ever skip over, they're all good. Songs such as \\"Ragged Wood\\" and \\"Quiet Houses\\" have faster paced sections which are uplifting. \\"Tiger Mountain Peasant Song\\" and \\"Meadowlarks\\" have a wonderful sparseness to them.     For the longest time Amazon had this CD in my \\"recommendations\\" but I neglected it. I don't recall why I ended up giving it a chance, but I'm very glad I did. Now I can't wait for Fleet Foxes to record more music.

B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I saw Mr. Cohen in concert in Cleveland a few weeks ago and the show was amazing! I listen the the CD in my car all the time. There is such a sexuality about his voice and words.  The instrumentals in this CD are beautiful. I love a live concert recording!  He doesn't tour much, if you get a chance, go.  Listening to Live In London is like being there.
B001E45XT4|2.0|How I use these:<br />Gaming for 1-2 hours at a time, working from home for 6-8 hours at a time and listening to music for a couple hours at a time.<br /><br />My notes on these:<br />-Impressive build quality. These feel far more sturdy in your hand than most headphones out there.<br /><br />-Tight fit at first, but it quickly loosens. Not an issue at all after a couple hours. These do expand quite a bit and based on my giant head, should fit anyone. The giant ears attached to the giant head fit comfortably inside the ear wells, too.<br /><br />-Hidden mic boom is AWESOME. It's usually the first thing to break on my headsets. Keeping it hidden when not in use is great.<br /><br />-Cord is VERY VERY thick. Looks and feels very heavy duty. I would not worry about rolling over the cord with my chair's wheels. I stepped on the cord of my previous set, pulling the microphone wire from where the wire splits into mic and headphone plugins at the PC. There is about 2 inches of lead wire on this pair (versus about 10\\" on the previous set). With the thicker cord and less lead wire, I don't see these ripping apart.<br /><br />-My previous set of Plantronics fit great, but the headset boom became loose very quickly. It does not appear this headset suffers that same flaw.<br /><br />What could be improved?<br />-The volume control dial could have a raised nub to more easily turn the volume up and down. It probably won't be a huge issue for most people, but I'm seriously considering super gluing something a little smaller than a pencil eraser to it.<br /><br />::::::::UPDATE  2/25/2011::::::<br />Oddly, these broke in an unexpected place, right where the over-the-head part connects to the ear cup. I'm not sure what caused them to break initially, but the ear cup with the mic boom is now completely disconnected. About 16 months. Not bad, I suppose.<br /><br />In the end, the volume control wasn't too big of a deal after a little time getting used to it. The ear cup size seems small, so it does get uncomfortable to wear after a few hours.<br /><br />I've updated the rating to reflect the update, but left the original text untouched.ve updated the rating to reflect the update, but left the original text untouched.
0380799006|4.0|Really great advice.  I enjoyed the stories told in the book.  I recommend this book for anyone with children!
B000ZELISO|3.0|The movie was so so but jeez, its not that fun anymore. Watching the movie is like doing a chore. Only reason your watching it is hoping to see if they stick to the book.  Who knows how they'll butcher the last entry of the book.    I just wish they didnt make harry potter movies instead opted for tv shows. 7 season corresponding to 7 books. therefore everything is explained!!    But whatever...
B00005N6KG|5.0|I love these headphones!   They are the only ones I use.  I was upset when the stores stopped carrying them but thrilled when I found them on Amazon.  My 17 yr old daughter loves them too and won't use anything else. They are comfortable and have great sound.  The price is great!!
B002SJIO5E|5.0|a first time director with a 10,000 budget created this eye popping and jaw dropping movie. the movie is hitting the millions in profits. one of the best movies that i have ever seen as a critic and one of the most intense metaphors ever putted on motion.  must see

B00005JPO1|5.0|I don't know why people complain about his one but it must be the even numbered Indiana Jones movies that nobody likes (very similar to how fans and others respond to the odd numbered Star Treks). This was a great adventure from start to finish and I couldn't have enjoyed it better. Ford steps back into the role seamlessly. Though a little older, he still handles the action scenes just like he did back in the 80s. The Russians are now the villains of the picture and Cate Blanchett plays Spalko brilliantly, bringing Lotte Lenya's Rosa Klebb from James Bond to mind (right down to the bob hairstyle). And it was enjoyable to have a female villain (Elsa from The Last Crusade doesn't really count in my opinion as she just didn't scream \\"evil\\" to me) and, other than Mola Ram from Temple, the only villain to get into the fights. And she was a step up from Donovan, who also just didn't seem villainous enough. Shia Labeouf I could've done without. I didn't like him in Transformers and I don't like him in this. Action doesn't seem to suit him and I didn't like the fact that Lucas/Spielberg made him Indy's son, which I was hoping throughout the film that he wasn't but I was disappointed. Karen Allen makes a welcome return and I enjoyed the bickering that she and Ford did. The rest of the supporting cast is also well played. The references to Connery, Elliot and other people/artifacts from the previous films were enjoyable (especially the Ark). I didn't mind the aliens at the end as it was set in the 50s and the sci-fi tone fit in well enough (Indy locking himself in the fridge was also something that didn't bother me). I don't why people think that its implausible/impossible for aliens to make an apperance, I mean the character did go up against a guy who could take your heart out and still live so extra-terrestrials aren't that far-fetched. Action sequences are excellent but everything just seems to be CG now and I blame Lucas for that. And finally, this will be the last time (for now anyway) that I have to praise (well I guess I don't have to but he's so good) John Williams, who brings in excellent new material while working in some of the old themes as well.(for now anyway) that I have to praise (well I guess I don't have to but he's so good) John Williams, who brings in excellent new material while working in some of the old themes as well.
B002QH2NUA|4.0|Yet another Paul McCartney live album, you might say, after so many other live albums released already? Yes, and as a lifetime McCartney fan it is right, for several reasons, the main one being the DVD, highly recommended. I'll get to that in a minute.<br /><br />\\"Good Evening New York City\\" was recorded over three nights in July at the new Mets stadium. The 2 CDs (33 tracks; 122 min.) bring a stellar performance by Sir Paul (hard to believe the man is now 66 yrs old or thereabouts). In my book CD1 (17 tracks; 60 min.) is the superior one, in that Paul brings a lot of tracks that are a little bit off-center, check out \\"Flaming Pies\\", \\"Let Me Roll It\\", \\"Mrs. Vanderbilt\\", but also \\"Highway\\" (from the latest \\"Fireman\\" CD), which somehow fits in very nicely. CD2 (16 tracks; 62 min.) brings a more traditional serving of old Beatles hits, especially towards the end, but check out the great \\"A Day In The Life/Give Peace a Chance\\" medley and \\"Something\\", among other highlights.<br /><br />The DVD (125 min.) brings these same songs, and this is where for me this set really pays off. It isn't mixed up with documentary-style interludes, it simply brings the show, and thankfully it is watchable, as in: it's not MTV-style where the angle changes every second. Furthermore, if you have the proper home-theatre set-up (which I happen to have), it sounds absolutely fantastic, and truly the reason to buy this.<br /><br />I was not at the New York shows, but I did catch Sir Paul again after a long period (my previous time was here in Cincinnati in 1993 on the \\"Off the Ground\\" tour), when I saw Sir Paul headlining Coachella in April. His set was similar to the set found here, and it was fabulous. That night at Coachella happened to be the anniversay of Linda's passing away, and he dedicated \\"My Love\\" to her, and even though it's not my favorite Macca track, it brought chills to me. That said, the \\"Good Evening New York\\" set is awesome and a steal at $13.99 here at Amazon.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|Hot after his film \\"La Femme Nikita\\", in 1994 Luc Besson (\\"The Fifth Element\\", \\"The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc\\", writer of \\"The Transporter\\" films) would go on to work on his film \\"Leon\\" (Leon the Professional).  The film was written and directed by Besson and featured music by Eric Serra (\\"The Fifth Element\\", \\"The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc\\", \\"GoldenEye\\") and cinematography by Thierry Arbogast (\\"Babylon AD\\", \\"Femme Fatale\\", \\"Kiss of the Dragon\\", \\"The Messanger: The Story of Joan of Arc).<br /><br />The film would reunite Besson with popular French action star Jean Reno (Mission: Impossible\\", \\"Ronin\\", \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", \\"The Pink Panther\\") who he worked on in \\"Nikita\\" and \\"Le grand bleu\\" and would be the first major film for 12-year-old actress at the time, Natalie Portman (\\"Star Wars: Episodes I-III\\", \\"V for Vendetta\\", \\"Paris, je `taime\\").  For the most part, the film received mostly positive critic reviews but also some controversy as the film would feature an older man raising a young girl and teaching her how the life of a hitman.  Let alone, a 12-year-old who is attracted to an older man.<br /><br />\\"Leon the Professional\\" had an original theatrical release but there was an extended version (or Director's Cut) featuring an extra 24-minutes of footage which focuses on Leon training Mathilda but also the emotional connection the two have for each other.  Both are included on the Blu-ray release and personally, I prefer the extended version as the screenplay focuses a lot on the friendship between Leon and Mathilda.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />When I first saw \\"Leon the Professional\\", I admit that I was happy.  Why?  Many films created between 1986-1996 and released on Blu-ray, some really look their age, transfer is not all that great or is very soft but for \\"Leon the Professional\\", the colors are vibrant, blacks are nice and deep and detail can be seen.  The old  buildings that Leon and Mathilda live in, you can see all the cracks and how old they look.  It just seems much more clearer.  Sharpness is great and the colors just pop. There is a nice amount of grain as well and no softness.  This doesn't look like a film that is 15-years-old.  So, needless to say...picture quality is fantastic.<br /><br />Audio quality is equally impressive.  Featured in 5.1 DTS-HD MA (in English, French and Portuguese), there are really good action sequences and gun fights that really utilize the soundscape from the front, center and surround channels.  Especially during the final confrontation, the film sounds great.  Music by Eric Serra also helps create the mood.  For the most part, this is not an action film that is overly aggressive as most of the film is dialogue-based between Leon and Mathilda but for the most part, when the action scenes do happen, you'll definitely hear those gun shots, machine gun rattling, explosions really clear.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Leon the Professional\\" on Blu-ray comes with the following special features:<br /># 10 Year Retrospective: Cast and Crew Look Back - (25:09) A featurette released on the 2004 DVD.  A virtual reunion with interviews with the cast talking about a film they made 10 years ago.  How the film came to be made and how the talent were cast for the film.<br /># Jean Reno: The Road to Leon - (12:25) A featurette about Jean Reno, his personal life of him growing up and his previous works that led to him playing the character of Leon.<br /># Natalie Portman: Starting Young - (13:49) Natalie Portman talks about reading the script at 11-years-old and wanting to do the part despite her parents feeling it was inappropriate.  Working with Jean Reno and Luc Besson and how she was able to accomplish those emotional crying scenes and more.<br /># Fact Track - Viewers can watch the extended version of the film with a fact track.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"Leon the Professional\\" is a riveting, action-packed film.  And for those who are familiar with Luc Besson films, you expect intense gunfighting sequences and plenty of destruction.  Granted, he has done a lot more of that now with recent films but back in 1994, \\"Leon the Professional\\" was entertaining then and 15-years later, continues to be quite entertaining now.<br /><br />Jean Reno is really good playing those action, hitman type of scenes.  He's a tough guy but Luc Besson knows how to utilize his character quite well in his films.  Gary Oldman is always a fantastic villain and his character Stansfield is just repulsive.  Murdering young children definitely made the viewer want either Leon or Mathilda to really get their revenge on him by the end of the film.  And the way it played out, was well-done.  But as Reno and Oldman were fantastic, Natalie Portman was incredible. The actress demonstrated in this film that she can be an actress that can excel in emotional scenes and for the most part, back in 1994, there was no doubt in anyone's mind that she would grow up to be an actress to watch for.  Overall, great acting by the three main characters of the film.<br /><br />As for the controversy which led the film to be cut for its theatrical version, I can understand where opposition groups were coming from.  Mathilda was a child that was raised in a dysfunctional setting and she has been emotionally damaged that the only person that she sees as her savior was Leon.  A man who lives in isolation and his best friend is a plant.  But of course, there is a sense of sadness that broods with the character of Leon and somehow, these two find comfort within each other.  For Leon, it's more of a friend, while Mathilda, looks at it her emotions as being in love.  Nevertheless, for those who get disturbed by those scenes of Mathilda's emotional anguish (ala Russian Roulette) and the fact that Leon trains Mathilda on how to kill people (using a paint gun), there is a theatrical version included on the Blu-ray that eliminates those scenes and an extended version that contains those extra 24 minutes.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray, I just felt the picture quality was fantastic for an early 90's film.  With quite a few 90's films that looks its age, the amount of colors and detail for on this HD release was great and the audio quality was also great.  Fans of the film will definitely enjoy this Blu-ray release, especially since it has both theatrical and extended versions of the film.<br /><br />Overall, a solid Blu-ray release for \\"Leon the Professional\\".

B002KWLUU0|5.0|I've been a fan of Prefab Sprout since 1988, when, as a lover of vinyl and a frequent visitor of my local record store noticed FROM LANGLEY PARK TO MEMPHIS staring at me (this was when albums were cheaper and you could buy an album because it looked interesting). After that I found TWO WHEELS GOOD at a pawn shop on cassette (have since bought all their stuff on CD). But enough of my rambling...    I can't seem to play anything else other than this CD...I absolutely love it. True, it's just Paddy...no Neil, no Wendy, no Martin even. I love Paddy's passion, in his songwriting and his voice. I've never been disappointed in Paddy McAloon or Prefab Sprout. If you love Prefab Sprout you should love this one. It's great!

0812974611|5.0|I have little to say that has not been repeated many times by other reviewers. This book is exciting, well-written, educational, fascinating. The author does a particularly good job with the pacing, you can feel how the interpersonal tensions of the characters come to a head just as Vesuvius does. I noticed the phrase \\"begs the question\\" is misused on page 62 by Pomponianus, however.    One thing I would have very much appreciated however was much more detailed annotations and a glossary. I found some of the descriptions of the workings of the aqueduct hard to follow; I would have really appreciated diagrams. I also would have liked generally more background information - there should be some kind of \\"guide to Pompeii\\" for non-experts like me. But even without this knowledge, I still thought the book was terrific.
B001AVCFK6|3.0|The first time I saw the movie at the theatre I hated it. Kirk who was always the strongest character in the cast, became the weakest. This Abrams, has he ever watched the old Star Treks? Gene Roddenberry's vision was destroyed in this movie. The old Star Trek was always loved for its characters and the stories, we didn't have or need all the special effects,it was cast and stories. The first eight or ten minutes of the movie was horrible. If Abrams would have done any homework at all, Jim Kirk at the Academy was a bookworm, a serious student, not a juvenile delinquent as this story unfolds. The story was weak, they actually cast it well, except for Kirk. In todays world, instead of using an original story, which was great, they keep butchering all these great old science fiction movies by changing everything, all they need to do is add the special effects. These are classics as they have stood the test of time, espically Star Trek. As for a three star rating, I could never give any thing from Star Trek a one, thus the three. It will be the worst of all the movies by far. I hope that if someone else does another one, they will do their homework, as this is one of the greatest adventures ever written. Bright spot of the movie,seeing Nimoy as Spock<br />again.

B002OB9KPE|3.0|I love the first two Transatlantic albums, but I waited eight years for THIS?!  Third-rate riffs and melodies (one of the main themes is a ripoff of \\"Court of the Crimson King\\"), and why not - Neal has produced FIVE \\"EP\\" (Evangelical Prog) solo albums in the interim, chock full of riffs and melodies that would have been great in Transatlantic, so its no wonder he's run out of good material.    Roine, Pete and Mike were able to leave behind the sounds of their full-time bands in order to step into a Transatlantic \\"head space\\", but Neal used this album as a vehicle for more evangelizing.  If I wanted another Neal Morse EP album in my collection (I have the first three and they're good), I would have purchased \\"Sola Scriptura\\" instead!      Of course, the performance is impeccable and Pete's growly bass tone is magnificent.  If you liked the Beatle-esque parts of past Transatlantic, you'll have to get the bonus disc version, which has more interesting and adventurous tunes (with the exception of Neal's praise and worship song) and some cover tunes.  The \\"Making Of...\\" DVD is always fun to watch.    I was hoping for an another extraordinary album, but \\"Whirlwind\\" is just ordinary, and burdened by Neal's \\"agenda\\"...
B001PB3RU8|5.0|Ever had that awful feeling after a bad breakup?  Where you just want to go out and drink a ton to drown your sadness?  Florence Welch knows that feeling - she even wrote a song about it.  In fact, my favorite song on the album, appropriately titled \\"Hurricane Drunk.\\"<br /><br />This is an album I happened to stumble upon based on a quick snippet in a magazine.  I bought it on a whim, and I've had it on repeat about 4 hours a day for the last week.  The first song, \\"Dog Days are Over\\" sets the tone for the album - quirky, bouncy, with killer vocals.  Those killer vocals are all throughout the album - Florence can really sing!  The lyrics and instrumentation, as mentioned before, are quirky, but insanely beautiful.  They're also very catchy - I've woken up singing \\"Drumming Song\\" in my head several days in a row.<br /><br />Other standouts on the album include \\"Howl\\" - a sweeping epic of a song that has distinctly werewolf vibes to it; as well as the stunning \\"You've Got the Love\\" - a cover of a gospel song, Florence has made it universal - and catchy as hell.  You want to sing along as you journey with Florence through the album.  Emotions vary widely - joyous, melancholy, yearning, grieving, and hopeful.  This is one of the best albums I have bought in many years, and I can't wait for anything else that Florence has to offer in the future.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I originally wanted to watch it because I am a huge Jorja Fox fan and she stars in it.  I wish that Jorja was more of a round character in this film.  Guy Pierce stars in it as a man (Leonard) who lost his short term memory in an accident the night his wife was murdered.  He can remember everything in his life perfectly up until that omnious night.  Out of revenge, Leonard (guy pierce) searches for his wife's murderer.  But he can't be certain about anything as he tries to uncover the truth.  This is a deep movie and it took me a couple of times watching it to understand a few things.  Great movie with a lot of suspense.

Now all we need is a little Anthrax in the mix, and we can all be Caught In A Mosh somewhere at a show in 2010! Metal Lives!

A few years went by and no new material surfaced aside from a live recording or the occasional members effort outside of the grunge groups reign. April 5th, 2002 the fateful date that marked the end of any hope towards a new Alice in Chains album... and more importantly the death of lead singer Layne Staley.<br /><br />Out of the dark and into the light Alice in Chains have reunited after searchlights hit a beacon of hope with new singer William DuVall.  Tours with Velvet Revolver marked a chance for the band to begin writing new material, soon word began of a more `cathartic' album in the makeshift. Septembers jewel \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\".<br /><br />Eleven tracks spanning a little under an hour, is what we have to take a look at. Thick guitar airwaves buffet \\"All Secrets Known\\", truth be told the real secret for many was how good is Duvall? Rest assure he's quality cut, and avoids using his intensely electrifying Layne mimicry. Opting for what he calls a `guitar players vocal style' which he later defines as less flamboyant, and more rhythmic.<br /><br />Alice in Chains never expired just never updated there record collection, we find real rocking tunes with accessibility and technicality. Rock bouncers include \\"Check My Brain\\" and \\"Lesson Learned\\" both flaking similarities onto one another. Jerry Cantrell assured fans musically it was going to be a heavy hitter, \\"A Looking in View\\" (first single) shown us he wasn't kidding. AiC, dark for their time compared to grunge titans they leaned more to doom ridden themes, and metallic tendencies. \\"Last of My Kind\\" anthemia, brutal, knows when to interject and feed distortion pedals, it's the kinda song when listened to on headphones you seek speakers asap.<br /><br />Funny thing is how different the following track \\"Your Decision\\" is, chimes of high performance acoustic, hovers over there final days with Layne and his fatigued style. Cantrell's knack for his G&L electric guitar is great and all but his acoustic tunes are worth acknowledgment as well. The drums smack instead of pound.<br /><br />Once more titanic tune \\"A Looking View\\" precedes the soft sandy acoustic galloping tune \\"When the Sun Rose Again\\". This remains my pick off the album since its initial release, plays off as an oasis in the intensity of other tracks. Though Cantrell is firing off frets, many may miss on first listen the nuances of his labor, if you miss it on this track try focusing less on solos and more on the texture.<br /><br />\\"Acid Bubble\\" has a blistered corrosive intro pinging the sour notes with melancholy. At the half way mark as the acidic bubble surfaces to the top  it chisels a rough rocking groove (we'll call this the painfully pleasurable ulcer of the album).<br /><br />Humbuckers don't razor notes, they chug em' thicken em' and muddy em' up a bit, \\"Take Her Out\\" grit in your system you don't wish to clean out right away. Trend here is the emphasis on past sorrows which is easily understandable and times feels untreatable on a multitude of levels \\"Private Hell\\" peaks the level of intimacy.<br /><br />Nothing on this album can peg a mourning soul more then the title track (\\"Black Gives Way to Blue is also the closing song). Weeping guitar slides, minor chords, and the groups first signature piano tune (thanks to yes Sir Elton John), exhaust the listener to a final vocal halt. Alice in Chains wrote polar opposite songs usually dealing with two sides of the coin, heart ache and rage. \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\" sheds this depiction for the finally, giving us an instantly recognizable feeling a haunting that wont cease.<br /><br />No youthful boyish charm left from the groups early \\"Facelift\\" days, trace amounts of anger similar to  \\"Dirt\\" scuff here and there, the fading star that was there self entitled album now has a second wind.r is great and all but his acoustic tunes are worth acknowledgment as well.

B001TH7GT6|5.0|In the past, I've gotten Monster cables for some exorbitant price. I cannot detect a functional difference in these. Similar gold plating, similar solid connections, similar great signal. Way lower price. (And I do love the \\"just open the box\\" frustration-free packaging.)<br /><br />Based on this item, I would certainly get Amazon connectors again.

B002M4ZH8C|4.0|Well written.  Full of insights about financial history.  I did not appreciate that the fate of the south in the Civil War was cast with the fall of New Orleans and the subsequent collapse of their monetary system.  Lot of information about this kind of stuff and understandable by a financial tyro.    Compton Broders
1416562605|4.0|This is a very good book that I describe as an allegory for the vast corruption, and difficulty of living a productive, honest life in India and in much of the  developing world.  The author is quite angry and does a good  job of describing these problems through the fictional character who is the protagonist for the tale.
B002KREVCO|5.0|This is an awesome set filled with tons for the hardcore fan!!!!!  Why there has never been a full length Live disc of Bon Scott era material is just criminal.  The 2nd disc helps us all hear how amazing they were back in that era.  The DVD did not do much for me, but the 1st 2 discs of material are MUST have.
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|this is an amazing blu ray.the killers deliver on every note (no pun intended).brandon flowers and the rest of the band have an amazing stage presence and they are definitely gonna go down with the likes of the beatles,rolling stones etc....they have picked some great songs to perform although i do wish they played neon tiger,everything will be alright,tidal wave,four winds,a crippling blow and perhaps an acoustic version of read my mind but its still awesome all the same.the blu ray quality is crisp and the colours are lush and truly bring the gig alive right to your home.keep it up guys...you clearly have this gift of making great music.cant wait for the next LP.brandon flowers is the most graceful and talented musician out there.what melodies these chaps come up with.two thumbs up all the way !!!
B002QEXN2K|5.0|I am a bit hesitant to review albums so soon, but it might be now or never.    I like all of JM's albums so far. When I first heard \\"Continuum\\", I didn't like it. Within a week, I could not stop listening to it and listened to it every day for at least 2 months. It is now one of my favourite albums.    When I first heard \\"Battle Studies\\" -- a casual listen after coming home with the CD -- my reaction was that it was like an average 80's pop album, which describes the cover art perfectly, too. At just over 30 years old, is he already nostalgic for the 80s?    I have already given it a few more listens and it is growing on me. I am starting to appreciate each of the tracks on their own merits. It is growing on me. The subleties of the guitar work are revealing themselves.    The most important thing is that he is not standing still. This is not a rehash of any of his former work. It has the cohesiveness of an album, but the overall feel of an experiment. \\"Continuum\\" was a great album but was spacious. There is more going on all at once here. I have a feeling that his next album will benefit greatly from what he tried here. Until then, this one will do.    **UPDATE:  I have now listened to the album a great deal over the past few days, and my conclusion is now that it's an excellent album. I have increased my rating from 4 to 5 stars.    Here are some thoughts on select tracks:    ASSASSINS: I am surprised this song is generally being met with either indifference or dislike. I think it is one of the best tracks on the album. It does have some Seal-like pervasive background vocals, but I really like the aggressive guitar backing on this track.    HALF OF MY HEART: I don't mind this track, but the Taylor Swift mention is trivial and redundant. She sings two lines -- the same line twice -- on the whole track. It's almost as if they were thinking \\"how can we get Taylor Swift on this track for a front cover mention without having her presence wreck the song?\\". They could have put a guitar swoon in place of her lines and it might have been better.    CROSSROADS: I have never heard the original, but it sounds like a song with some soul turned into a straightforward pop track. It isn't out of place on the album, but it's weird that he would go to all efforts to make his own music so involved and then go so sparse with this one. The main guitar track has been so processed by effects that it ends up sounding a bit like a clavinet. Weird. Still, I like some of the other guitar work in this one.    The whole album is great for repeat listening. He knows what he is doing in that regard. There is enough variation (if subtle) that it doesn't get tiring when put on repeat... even all day, in my case.    The overall sound quality seems different from that of \\"Continuum\\" to me. The latter seemed spacious and bright, but this one sounds compressed and subdued. It is like a more mellow version of the \\"Heavier Things\\" sound quality.    I am also glad he is good at editing his own material. That is, he has not fallen into that trap of filling up the CD with all of the scraps lying around. There's no filler, really, and I wouldn't want to skip any of them. It's a tight, cohesive album.    If I had only listened to this album once, I would have walked away and given it 3 stars. I am glad I took the time to get to know it better.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|This a great film. Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter are fantastic together. Everyone talks about how violoent it was. Yes there is violence but that is just the backdropp of something bigger: The decay of western society. How everyone is so obsessed with the newest gaget that makes them even lazier than they previously were. I know that critics are supposed to be great at what they do. They missed the mark when rating this film. If you just focus on the violence, you will miss the rest of the movie. There is actually some humor in it. You Know? Comedy? It is really funny. The point is: Watch the entire film, let it simmer on your brain for a while, then make your opinon
0375413405|5.0|Julia Child barely cooked when she arrived in Paris, France in post World War II with her husband, Paul Child. The childless mature couple had Paul working for the United States government while Julia tried to keep herself busy. She studied French cooking on her own and studied the language. She became immersed in both the culture and the gastronomy of French cuisine. She studied at the famous Le Cordon Bleu cooking school in Paris, France. After she failed her first exam and returned to pass on her second exam (yes, even Julia Child failed the first exam). She and two other women, Simka, and Louisette, would form a cooking school in Paris to teach Americans how to cook French food.    After learning there was no English cookbook about French cuisine, Julia had found her purpose. Anyway, she and her colleagues, Simca, and Louisette, would collaborate on a cookbook for 10 years. They faced rejections and other issues. Since Julia was the American chef, she was able to help restructure the women's cookbook for the American market. Without Julia, there would have been no cookbook. She collaborated and they completed a cookbook that revolutionized American kitchens and kitchens worldwide.    Julia Child was smart enough to design a cookbook to cater to the novice chef/cook. The cookbook is a masterpiece that should be in your kitchen. The book is comprised of several sections like meat, sauces, deserts, etc. It's over 700 pages plus with more post-information from it's original publication. Unlike other cookbooks, this labor of love opened the doors for Julia Child to America's favorite French Chef
B002NOAF9W|4.0|\\"TRUTH IN PACKAGING\\" time first: OK, truth be told - the nay-sayers were (for the most part) correct.  Less than a half hour's worth of footage from the remnants of \\"Gimme Shelter,\\" and 15 additional songs - OH, and a \\"book,\\" and something that looks like a postcard with a naked lady and the the words \\"The Rolling Stones\\" atop her head - don't really justify paying $45 for this.<br /><br />THAT said:  Listening to \\"Ya Yas\\" now, repackaged, refurbished, \\"rechanneled,\\" whatever, is akin to going to see \\"Gone With The Wind\\" with a pair of sunglasses on - and taking them off just as you hear the words \\"Quittin' time!\\"  I play my CDs thru the same setup as my DVD, 5:1, whatever-it's called, and it's no longer  merely \\"my favorite CD,\\" it's now more like being there in the middle of the front 2 rows at Madison Sq Garden and pushing and shoving with all the hippies who obviously didn't \\"just say no.\\"  The sound is PHENOMINAL!

I (almost) recant my statement, agreeing with the \\"it's overpriced\\" whiners.  BB King is - STILL - a Gentleman, but to hear him in 1969 when he was still young & virile - a \\"veil will be lifted\\" from many a young person who was only familiar with \\"The Thrill Is Gone.\\"  And Ike and Tina....there are no adjectives to describe their performance without sounding like Cameron Crowe with a thesaurus.  My only disappointment is that the version included here of Otis' \\"I've Been Loving You Too Long\\" is NOT the version from \\"Gimme Shelter\\" that is almost porno-lite.  Regardless:  Tina's performance here - as in, probably, EVERYTHING she has ever done - was, most definitely, the inspiration for Mick's last line in \\"Start Me Up,\\" where he sings of the (ahem) \\"recuperative powers\\" of the \\"Chanteuse-in-question,\\" you know, \\"You make a dead man...\\"<br /><br />Oh.............and the \\"gift box,\\" in which the whole conglomeration is sort of \\"encased,\\" will make an EXCELLENT container a for Christmas present, too!e with a thesaurus.

B002NWRMVS|1.0|First heard Jones on the Feb 2002 Jazziz compilation disk... Never had seen or heard her.... her talent was obvious, even as I was cleaning the house...  had no clue how beautiful she was....  Now what to do with it...  Unfortunately, [like many beautiful people, I was married to one] she has an inferiority complex and throughout her short career has chosen to surround herself with mostly sub-par talents.. [except the obvious winners, Charlie Hunter, Bonnie Raitt, etc.]<br /><br />How she wound up recording this loser I'll never know.... Lame songs, super lame lyrics, bush league production... this album is either a farce or a bad joke.... if I could give it \\"0\\" [zero] stars I would.... it is horrible.....<br /><br />Jones needs to get out in the clubs and play with the hot young jazz turks.... and the established standards.... and find herself... the handlers at blue note haven't a clue what to do with her that is obvious....  most of her dim bulb fans have no clue what she is capable of.... apparently, neither does she, maybe she's not that bright?...<br /><br />How could an incompetent producer mix down and tamper with a voice like hers?...  unbearable to listen too.... set her up in a room with an old Neumann and a grand, play a bit, then get Ceu's genius minimalist producer Gui Amabis and all the session people on [[ASIN:B002BVUBR8 Vagarosa]] and Jones could make a piece of art worthy of da Vinci [[ASIN:B00005JOC9 The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)]]...  [like Ceu already has]....  Ceu & Jones should be best friends [and, I could name dozens of others!!!, but Ceu will get you started].... not the goof balls she is hanging with [these are people she should have never met]....  or lets say she wants to continue in the indie direction, then she needs to study with the \\"Flaming Lips\\" [[ASIN:B000068PQ0 Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots]] or [[ASIN:B002MJM88O Embryonic]] [to start with] for a couple of years and enlist their talents..... her voice floating above their sound-scapes would be stunning....  but, this lost menagerie of almost pop songs {Chasing Pirates} is just not worthy or credible....<br /><br />One thing is for certain, she will NEVER make another album like this one, I guarantee it...  the music is almost as bad as the album cover.... now whose brilliant idea was the gossamer dress dog thing??? genius!!! {that's a joke}nd-scapes would be stunning....  but, this lost menagerie of almost pop songs {Chasing Pirates} is just not worthy or credible....

B000ETQR3Q|5.0|Nerf N STRIKE LONGSHOT CS-6  Large, unwieldy, the cocking mechanism is to far back, and the range stinks like crazy. The good thing about it is that when you get a 35 round clip(Raider CS-35only),and a box, flip the stand on the end of the gun down, put the barrel for the Recon on(take the one shot gun on the front off) and viola:! Super sniper rifle! For your normal battles, I wouldn't recommend the Longshot, but for sniping, sure! Go get it! (don't forget the addons)  The sight is more for looks than accuracy, but still, you get a little more accurate than you would without it. For extreme  accuracy, I would recommend the Recon CS-6  barrel with the Recon CS-6 sight. For super fast reloading, the stock has a little hole that you can put a clip in. Any clip will go in there. (the CS-6 RAIDER clip is a little to clumsy)  The stock is adjustable for shorter or longer arms. It slides in and out about 4 inches.  All in all, when fully customized, the CS-6 LONGSHOT is a SUPERB gun. One of these days I will get down to putting a video review on. Until then, Enjoy!
0307454541|1.0|The main mystery reminded me of a Scooby Doo episode - from the heroes putting together tenuous clues to the villain spilling all his secrets before he kills the hero to the ridiculous saving of the hero's life. I almost expected the villain to yell \\"And I would have gotten away with it too if it wasn't for you pesky kids!\\" as he sped away.<br /><br />The secondary mystery was convoluted and boring. The characters are so flat and the writing is so bad that I don't have any interest in the cliffhanger third mystery. Much of the story is descriptive where it should have been dialog. For example:<br /><br />--------------<br />For five minutes they discussed Blomkvist's shortcomings in the most irritating terms. Blomkvist leaned back and pretended to be insulted, but he frowned when Berger made some cryptic remarks that might allude to his failings as a journalist but might also have applied to sexual prowess.<br />--------------<br /><br />If the author cannot come up with any witty \\"cryptic remarks\\", then maybe that paragraph doesn't belong in the book.<br /><br />If the book had a good editing, some story lines and characters dropped, and the violent sex turned down, it could have been a passable Grisham clone. As it is, it was a very disappointing book and not the \\"literary masterpiece\\" the critics are raving about.
078322804X|5.0|In general, I don't mind the extra footage added to the movie. Some of it could have stayed lost, like the scene where Elwood leaves his job, but some of the other footage is fantastic. We get to hear the full length versions of such songs as Boom Boom Boom, Peter Gunn Theme, Can't Turn You Loose and Everybody Needs Somebody to Love. Those alone make the movie great. It's also great seeing any kind of extra footage with Belushi in it. When someone dies that young, seeing the extra footage is like coming across home video of somebody that you didn't know previously existed, so you get to have extra look at someone. This movie shows how the original was butchered so badly in the editing room after Universal ordered it cut down. They don't have a copy of the real original version which was close to 3 hours long with an intermission, as it was destroyed before the movie was theatrically released. The movie was made at a time when MTV was not yet established, therefore, people's attention spans were not as short. So while some reviewers here might complain about the extra footage of the Blues Bros parking the Bluesmobile in the alley, as a fan of films, especially those made up until 1980, I love the attention to the details that filmmakers put into their works. It reminds me of Apocolypse Now and The Good The Bad and The Ugly because of the way the directors took a long time establishing their shots. It's a well made film in spite of itself. I know the film went over budget and that Belushi was messed up on coke and the film was too long in length and short on jokes. It also came out against The Empire Strikes Back and during a year that movie attendance was down in general. The critics crucified it but the majority of them didn't even know who the Blues Brothers were and went after the movie because at the time it was the most expensive comedy ever made. Not unlike the Godfather Saga/Complete Epic or Apocolypse Now Redux or the director's cut of Leon:The Professional,the extended scenes are of great interest but don't compliment the timing of the movie as a whole. But if you are like me, you are a fan of all these movies, so you don't care. In spite of it all, The Blues Brothers manages to be a memorable classic and the extended version is interesting enough to warrant a look. It did wonders for blues music and blues artists. Until this movie, I had never heard of or listened to Sam & Dave, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, John Lee Hooker, James Brown, Aretha Franklin & Cab Calloway. Many others, including me, were introduced to these greats because of this film, and that itself is testimony to the greatness of the film. In my top 20 of the greatest movies of all time and one that definitely needs to be in your library. Tons of quotable lines. Long live Joliet Jake!
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I see so much written good and bad about JJ Abrams' newest rendition of \\"Star Trek\\".   Well, I grew up as a teenager watching the original series on TV - and it was good then - but not great either.  It became much more popular in the following years - and even I was a fan of it and the various spin off's that came around over the years.  It's now 43 years after the original series and JJ Abrams does a remake of the original - not the series, but certainly of the cast and crew,  Well, its now 2009 and all things need to be revitalized once in a while.  Abrams did a good job of that.    Abrams also does a good (not excellent) job at creating a contemporary movie resembling the original.  There was no need for him to stick to the \\"rules of Star Trek\\".  It was fictional, after all.  So he changed a lot of the characters and relationships.  Again this is entertainment, not history.  Did he make a successful re-make of Star Trek?  Of course.  It was fun to watch - and perhaps I know after all these years that none of this is real and none of this is a picture of the future.  It's just a movie - and it was a good one, though I can't see it winning an Academy Award.  I remember as a teenager watching Stanley Kubrick's \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" and thinking ,\\"wow, this is what the future will bring!\\"  Well, I was wrong! The year 2001 has come and gone and that movie nowhere resembled the world in which we live.  So please - look at Star Trek and see it for what it is - entertainment.    Much is said about the \\"encounter\\" with Spock and Uhura.  Again, please accept this for what it is - and insignificant part of the story line.  In the original series, there was an episode where Kirk kissed Uhura.  But that was more a statement of the times than anything to do with a storyline.  The series was produced only 2 years after the Civil Rights Act of 1965 - and inter-racial relationships (even a kiss) were unheard of on prime time television.  So the producers of Star Trek threw that in for some excitement.  At the time, it was controversial - hardly now in our present time.  Perhaps Abrams simply isn't old enough to understand that it only meant something in 1967.  Fast-forwarding it to 2009 with a twist was a waste of time.  But no one is perfect.    Enough said.  Did I enjoy the movie?  Yes.  Would I watch it again?  No.  It was good, but not great.  Buy it, watch it, and see for yourself.  But please - remember it is just a movie.  It isn't supposed to be accurate, a statement of the times, or carry on some legacy that is instrumental in our society.  It's at best an enjoyable couple of hours.
B002QEXN2K|3.0|While you should immediately delete \\"Crossroads\\" after you rip this CD, that's a good word for Mayer at this point. He's so talented that even a mediocre effort like this is better than 90% of everything else out there, but he seems to have a run smack into the reality of the shallow life of a celebrity.     One song he's celebrating his freedom to have unlimited one-night-stands, the next he's longing for true love. John, get out of the limelight and re-connect with your true self and maybe your next CD will live up to your abilities.
0061735817|4.0|If you read and liked the book, then you will like the audiobook.  And yes, it does have the footnotes in it.  If you have never read the book and love a good fantasy story, this is probably one of the funniest ones out there.    The story itself deserves 5 stars.  I'm subtracting 1 star because the formatting lacks notification that you need to change disks.  For those with a single disk player, it is kind of annoying to have it loop back to the beginning as a notification that it is time for the next disk.  But all in all, the narrator does a wonderful job and the story is unabridged.  I'm glad I bought it as it will be in high rotation.
B000ZM1MGE|3.0|I first saw this movie not long after it's release in 1978 when I was 17 years old. Even back then I could not figure out why this guy tried to pull off this stunt in a foreign country? Or even in the USA?    It is an entertaining albeit violent piece of entertainment and the musical score is top notch.     But I have re watched this movie several times since and now in my late 40's still can't figure out what motivated this guy into thinking he should have got off scot free or even a reduced sentence for obviously & blatantly committing a crime in a foreign country no less. It's noteworthy that the real Billy Hayes was disappointed with this movie as it contains a number of errors from his side of the story & even Oliver Stone later apologized to the Turks for the not so subtle racist and anti Muslim twists this film takes.     It is a well done film but I have a difficult time feeling sympathy for the main character. Instead I see the film's version of Hayes as just another spoiled American brat expecting to find leniency for breaking the law.
B000F7CMRM|2.0|RS Steube is accurate - and the movie was not for me.  It wasn't \\"bad\\", but it wasn't \\"good\\" either.  And more resembled a TV mini-series lumped together for a few hour movie.  Barely 2 stars.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|If my budget permits I'm like so totally getting this as an X-Mas present for my father as a fellow Beatles fan who actually got to experience the Beatlemania during the 60's I know his GONNA love this ultimate box set (which btw I'm so freaking jealous cuz he met my mom at a Beatles show when he was my age >_< would tell me tons of hawt chicks were there & they actually gave a guy a chance unlike freaking now! >_<) Imma benefit from his box set cuz when he opens it imma download all their songs on to my iPod cuz Apple are being a bunch of jerks the have Lady Gaga, Soulja Boy, etc b.s. but no Beatles?! WTF!

B00003CXAA|1.0|These are by far the longest, most boring, and overall possibly the worst movies ever.<br /><br />The Godfather part I comprises maybe 3 or 4 of the most boring movies ever. It's about 10 or 15 hours of stupid, inane BS that nobody could possibly care about. I tried to watch it all the way through, but fell asleep after about 6 hours.<br /><br />The Godfather part II is even longer, somewhere between 15 and 20 hours, which according to Godfather fans makes it better than the first.<br /><br />The Godfather part III is so boring and awful that even fans of the first two movies can't stand it.<br /><br />And keep in mind, I was able to sit through all 4 or 5 hours of Citizen Kane and I actually kind of liked it, so my taste in movies is not the problem here.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I loved the movie, especially Spock.  Zachary Quinto was great as Spock.  I love this movie so much that I am actually going to buy the DVD (heck I might also get the blue ray version for when I get a blue ray player).  This movie reminded me so much of the original series because it had that magic the original series has.  I could never get into star wars( the only star wars movie I was able to watch in its entirety was the recent one). I loved the original star trek, Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and the first two season of Voyager; I never got into Enterprise with Scott Bakula eventhough I loved him in quantum leap.

B000AJIF4E|4.0|I have purchased between 6 and 8 pairs of these headphones over the last 15 years.  I do professional audio with them and I am a little hard on them.  In the past I have always been happy with their durability, buy the last two have a new issue.  The cable covering on both of the last two has split, exposing bare wires.  I never had this problem before and it seems that they changed the formula of the housing texture wise.  I hope someone from sony will see this and look into the problem.  As far as sound quality goes they are great for monitoring sound.  I just hope sony fixes this issue before I move on to another brand.

0375434526|4.0|It is a great book, with a tame ending. But, you are enlighted about the ancient scripture's lost symbol, god and spiritual knowledge. This, which is with in ourselves. the book has a great narration and story telling bringing out the God in Ourselves- a rediscovery of sorts. I agree with the author that scientific discoveries or inventions today are only re-discoveries or re-inventions.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|This is a great season with a twist ending! Dexter is the best thing to happen to tv since Buffy the Vampire Slayer!
B001SAHOBO|5.0|Donnie Yen is one of the most underrated actions stars (in the US. Not only are his skills in top form, his acting this excellent film is also the best he's ever done.    Ip Man is an epic on the scale of The Godfather or The Departed. You cheer and weep for Ip Man and his family as they careen through war-torn China.    Seeing this on DVD was a thrill but I would love to see it on the big screen somewhere.    A must buy for martial arts and action film fans.

B0000AK7AA|5.0|I have grown up with this movie. It is an all time favorite of mine and I recommend this to absolutely everyone! Christina Ricci is adorable in this and Devon Sawas cameo as real life Casper is sweet!
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I am here to let everyone know this is a great buy for 19.99!  If you can find it cheaper, DO IT! This has 8 deleted scenes, about 6 behind the scenes programs, and a gag reel and cometary on two discs!  I have watch the gag reel, it was funny! I have watched the movie, great movie! I don't think you can really ask for anything else in a copy of a new release movie in this day in age.  I even liked it so much I bought my friend a copy also! So yes I recommend this, and I am glad a director like J.J. Abrams can do a great job! I love his show Lost, and I love his movie.  I hope this helps people!
B00284G2IA|4.0|I have owned the DVD for a couple of years and watched it about a dozen times. I thought I would try the Blu-ray version.  WOW! The video on the Blu-ray is so much better then the DVD.  The DVD looks washed out, the blacks levels are gray, and the colors lack intensity.  On the Blu-ray the blacks are black, the colors have full saturation and the level of details is astounding! When I watched the Blu-ray last night, I felt like I was watching the concert for the first time!    If you have the DVD, buy the Blu-ray, the upgrade is worth it. If you like Nightwish, buy the Blu-ray. If you like Metal but have never heard of Nightwish, buy the Blu-ray. Nothing else matters.
0786868724|5.0|It is in the same idea as Tuesday with Morrie but with religous men as the principle men.  I learned about the Jewish relation and how a man can make something good in Detroit after living a life that many would have gone down the tube but he helped so many people in a church no one would think it has any use.
0312370849|5.0|This book was a joy to read. I liked the way the author used the two time periods to tell the story.    It is sad to think that when we humans do unthinkable things to each other we try to hide it from our own history.  While parts of the book may make you cry, everyone should read it.
B000AA4IF8|5.0|I won't go into reviewing the incredible music on this set which has been done quite thoroughly elsewhere on the Amazon site. I just wanted to alert others who may be considering buying this Japanese import that the discs do NOT come housed in miniature LP sleeves, as stated in the product description. What you will receive is virtually identical to the 1996 Ryko-issued set, with each disc coming in a cheesecloth-style protective inner sleeve placed together in a cardboard box that also contains a 24 page booklet and a few inserts written in Japanese. Hopefully, you too will also be able to score Lather from a reputable Marketplace seller and save yourself $10 as I did. Enjoy the tunes!
0547258305|5.0|In a land of seven kingdoms, babies are monitored closely.  Their eyes, mostly.  If one changes colors, they're a graceling.  Being being a Graceling is quite the burden.  To be one, means that you're nothing more than property of your king.  Your parents must hand you over to them as it means you're graced with a natural skill.  Of course Gracelings do not come with manuals.  They must be monitored.  Their skills tend to become obvious early on.  If useful, the king keeps them in his employ.  If not he'll send them home where they tend to be shunned.<br /><br />In Katsa's case she spent her life being trained and used as a Graceling fighter.  Her uncle/king abusing her grace to strike fear in people of all of the lands.  She, however, had created her own secretive counsel on the side.  Determined to do odd jobs on her own.  Not to bully  or kill, instead to help people who needed her skills.<br /><br />It's in this capacity that she saves an elderly man who had been kidnapped from another kingdom .  This leads her to meet his grandson -- Po.  Thanks to his own grace, he presents her with the first true challenge that she has ever faced in a fight.  Once they're sure that Po's grandfather is safe, they begin to train together and then set off to find who had kidnapped him -- and why.<br /><br />A very good book.  Of course like most YA books these days, there are some scenes that parents of younger teens may be leery of, even though they're not actually graphic.  Sex and violence are here though done tastefully.

0385504225|4.0|The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown was an ejoyable read.  The short chapters and action made the book easy to read without losing the story line.  The book drew you in and was difficult to put down.  I was sorry when I finished the book because I felt like it ended abruptly.
B000GW8RX4|5.0|This is most likely the best example of a 1970s hard rock concert available. This was the reason Rainbow was voted best live act of 1977. Their strength was always in their live set. I remember going up to Chatsworth Park at night with a recorder and two speakers and listening to Rainbow On Stage, drinking Boones's Farm wine and smoking pot.I've compared both recordings and this one is superior.Besides this Rainbow Rising is all you need to own from Rainbow.
B001I82RVS|4.0|This move was fun, crazy, insane, disgusting, and just straight up WTF!    And i havent even seen it with the volume on yet. We played this movie at a party on a big screen just for visuals and soon everyone was watching the screen yelling and having a good time.    Some of the imagery is shocking. Everyone was talking about it for days and how crazy it was. This movie scored lots of fans and even got me fans of my movies selections.    It is definitely a movie worth watching if you to just like to have a wild crazy good time.
B000ULQV0W|4.0|For individuals who are Eddie Vedder fans more than they are pearl jam fans, this soundtrack is excellent!  He wrote almost all the tunes on it, played almost all the instruments, and even helped engineer and do cover art work.  It's mellow, like the movie it was made for, but it's deep, reflective, full of raw emotion, and raging with passion for music-making that seems to come out of good musicians as they start to age beyond just making good show-cuts.[[ASIN:B000ULQV0W Music for the Motion Picture Into the Wild]]
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Unless you feel that you can't live without reading about \\"secret\\" Masonic lore, there are hundreds, even thousands of more entertaining books that you could be reading. How about a nice Lustbader or a juicy Ludlow? Yechhh....
0385340575|3.0|All of the Reacher books are fun to read, but they are more or less the same book, Child just changes the names and places a bit.    Reacher is going to get an improbable call to action.  He's not going to know what a cell phone or DVD is.  There will be a memory stick involved.  You're going to read about what his coffee is like, and what the local geography is like.  Some blood and guts  Gun descriptions  He's going to beat the bad guys through shear logic.  He's going to sleep with a woman detective in a one page Wham Bam, Thank you Mam.  You are to believe that enlisting in the U.S. Army will turn you into a Ninja  He will be insanely lucky, and smart.  Reacher will be an unstoppable beast-man.  There will be a body count, but it's OK, cause he's Reacher.    That's pretty much every Reacher novel.    Still fun though.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|I found this show this year on USA and I don't know what I'd do without it. I lost my Grandma a year and a half ago due to negligent post-op nursing (non care - she had insurance). At least two out of many nurses were horrified. I want to thank everyone who works on this show and my Grandma in heaven thanks you too. It isn't easy to find a show that can strike the right balance in all aspects of production. To me it isn't NCIS without McGee so I might not buy the first season. If I could give NCIS 10 stars I would!
0316855006|5.0|Although, it has been some time that I read this inspirational book, it is forever singed into my mind as one of the best books written by a most noble, couragous and wise man.  I have added Nelson Mandela to my very short \\"Hero\\" list.  With the holidays approaching it would be a wonderful gift!!!!
B001GCUO16|3.0|For some reason, this movie was butchered by critics and, to be honest, it's full of ups and downs that leave audiences with a bittersweet aftertaste. There are incredible scenes that prove almost impossible to be shot, like that of the helicopter, but then, for some reason, high definition shows how poorly finished Wolverine's claws are in that bathroom scene.   I don't think the story is worse than X-men III's, but it's almost impossible not to miss the underlying ideas of the Singer era. There is a second part coming. Hugh Jackman is an excellent actor. Let's hope the second part is a bit more interesting than this one!
0545123267|4.0|All her life, Grace has lived at the edge of the forest and every year as the seasons begin to turn colder, she waits and watches for her wolves to appear. Her friends and family can't understand Grace's fascination with the wolves that almost took her life years ago, but Grace feels an unexplained connection to one wolf in particular - the one who protected her from the other wolves that awful day. Every winter, Grace waits for her wolf to return, knowing he will stay close to her throughout the winter - a bright spot in the otherwise lonely and cold season.    At the beginning of the school year, all of Mercy Falls is shocked to discover a fatal wolf attack on a local bully, Jack Culpeper. The entire community is ready to take to the woods to hunt the dangerous wolves down, but Grace can feel nothing but sympathy and worry for her wolf. Then a boy shows up on her porch, wounded, and Grace is sure she knows him and knows she will do anything in her power to keep him near.    Unlike the non-stop, hold your breath action of Ballad, Shiver is a rather quiet book. Neither Grace or Sam are alpha heroes by any means, but they both posses courage and strength in spades. Sam especially has had to grow up faster than any boy ever should but who wants nothing more than to retain his humanity. To label Shiver simply as a 'werewolf' novel would be a gross underestimation. Most definitely it is a love story about two practical, old souls who have experienced more than your average teen and who forge a connection well outside of convention.    Maggie Stiefvater's secondary characters are also a study in contrast. They aren't ever distinctly good or evil, they are just people who sometimes make good choices but who often make incredibly bad choices too. One of my favorites is the spoiled diva Isabel Culpeper who Grace wants nothing to do with but who ultimately comes to her aid when she's most needed. Additionally, there are lots other of little details that make this a good read: the temperature reading at the beginning of each chapter, the alternating point of view of Sam and Grace, and very real, very compelling nature of Sam's wolf pack. I can fully understand why Grace is jealous of Sam's idyllic upbringing - I am too.    [...]
1419551795|3.0|This book by no means contain the toughest questions.  I've taken the test once, and believe me, it was harder.  But this is not my biggest complaint about this book. Since, majority of the test banks found in GMAT books on the market are all around the same level-this one might even be a little tougher.    I simply cant stand the layout of this book!!!  I would rather have a chuck of questions and then see the answers+explanations in the next chuck!  This book would have 2-4 questions, and answers, another 2-4, another set of answers.  It was driving me insane!  I felt like my pace was broken and I was not able to \\"get in the zone\\".    I guess there are people that like to see the answer as soon as they are done with the problem.  I simply find that distracting.  But then again, no book is perfect.  It is VERY hard to find sets of questions that are identical to the real test and with comparable level of difficulties.

UNLESS YOU HAVE ALREADY MADE UP YOUR MIND THAT YOU ARE DEFINITELY AN ELVIS 70'S MUSIC FAN, THIS IS NOT THE BEST PLACE TO BEGIN YOUR COLLECTION.  I WOULD START FROM THE 50'S AND WORK YOUR WAY CHRONOLOGICALLY TOWARD THE 70'S.  GET TO KNOW ELVIS, BEGINNING WITH THE SUN SESSIONS, THEN WORK YOUR WAY TO 1977.    FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT OBJECT TO TAMPERING WITH ELVIS INSTRUMENTATION, THERE ARE 4 ELVIS REMIXES WORTH OWNING:  GUITAR MAN FROM 1980;  A LITTLE LESS CONVERSATION FROM THE 90'S OR 2000;  AND RUBBER NECKING ALSO FROM 2000 OR SO.  THE MOST RECENT IS BABY LET'S PLAY HOUSE (DANCE REMIX BY SPANKOX).    ALTHOUGH SPANKOX REMIXED A LOT OF HIGH PROFILE HITS FROM THE 50'S FOR ELVIS, YOU ARE BETTER OFF WITH THE ORIGINALS.  I SEE MINIMAL DIFFERENCE AND I OBJECT TO REMIXES WELL KNOWN STANDARDS SUCH AS HOUND DOG, DON'T BE CRUEL ETC.  THE LESSER KNOWN SONGS SEEM TO DO BETTER.    GOOD LUCK ON YOUR ELVIS JOURNEY
B002QH2NUA|4.0|Yes, once again Sir Paul has chosen to release a live album and DVD at the end of a concert tour.  He has done this repeatedly in recent years, so one would have to assume that he's selling lots of them - but why should you buy this one?  Well, first of all, the shows were fantastic; I saw him in DC, not in New York, but he really did put on a fabulous show.  Great songs, obviously, but his voice sounded strong (even if he can't quite hold the high notes out as long, and he can't nail the really high screaming stuff any more, he still sings everything in its original key and sounds ready to keep rockin' even after 2 1/2 hours) and his band is top-notch.  And the CD, while it strips away all the between-song chatting and just presents song after song, is a wonderful record of the show.  I personally would have preferred hearing a wee bit of banter, and the background vocals are too far down in the mix for my taste (I'm a musician, so I'm picky that way), but the overall sound is excellent.  It sounds live as it should, and it still has some rough edges, but it doesn't make the mistake of sounding cavernous, as live recordings sometimes do.  I also like that there are a few underexposed tracks on here - \\"Here Today\\", \\"Only Mama Knows\\", \\"Mrs. Vandebilt\\" - in the middle of all the massive megahits.  Best of all, though, is the DVD.  As others have mentioned here, Macca's concert films have usually been of the chopped up, lots-of-interviews-and-warm-happy-stories-about-families-who-are-really-big-Beatles-fans-and-come-to-the-show-where-they-get-to-meet-their-hero variety, and this is basically just the show, start to finish, songs uncut (except for \\"I'm Down\\", which intersperses Beatles at Shea footage with Paul at Citi) and set list intact.  Yeah, there are the fancam shots edited in there, but they're innocuous for the most part; the show's the thing, and the DVD really presents that well.  So I'd suggest that, if you're a big Macca/Beatles fan, this one is a must-have- even if you've got all the others.  If I had to chuck all my live Paul CDs and DVDs but one, this is the one I'd keep.  (Well, I'd be sneaky and figure out a way to keep \\"Tripping the Live Fantastic\\", too.  But don't tell anyone.)

B002NWRMVS|4.0|This is my very first review and it's only because so many people rated this poorly, that I had to say something positive about it....my god you guys, \\"come away with me\\" was a fantastic cd, as many of you know, it won tons and tons of awards...but most of the songs were covers.  Here, we are able to explore new aspects of Norah Jones' talent.  It is a bit more 'rockish' as a whole, but can definitely hear classic soothing Jones.  I'm confused as to the 'one star' critiques....did they actually listen to the cd? I'm unsure of those because I believe Norah to be a bit predictable...you pretty much know what you're getting when you buy one of her CDs (which is a good thing)...She's got a beautiful and unique voice that will leave your heart aching....if you like her previous works...you'll enjoy this....just be open to something new....don't pretend like every album she comes out with is going to sound like \\"come away with me\\"....it's done before! why would you want to that over and over again? For God's sake, let her explore her other musical-aspirations....it's beautiful...
B002HWRYJE|3.0|This new \\"Star Trek\\" reconceives the early days of the U.S.S. Enterprise, when Capt. Kirk, Mr. Spock, Dr. McCoy, Lt. Uhura, Scotty, Sulu, and Chekov first boarded the starship on which they would seek out new life, new civilizations, and boldly go where no man had gone before. This looks like it might be an attempt to reboot the \\"Star Trek\\" franchise from the beginning. I doubt it will succeed in that, but the film is entertaining enough in its own right. Trek fans will know that James T. Kirk succeeded Capt. Christopher Pike to command the Enterprise. This \\"Star Trek\\" accelerates Jim Kirk's ascent to the captain's chair and changes Pike's and Spock's roles by means of an alternative timeline created by the unfortunate results of a singularity in the 24th century.<br /><br />James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) grows into a reckless young man in Iowa of the 23rd century, as the half-human Spock (Zachary Quinto) struggles with his dual identity and rebels a little by attending Starfleet Academy instead of the Vulcan Science Institute. When Kirk gets into fisticuffs with some Starfleet cadets, Capt. Pike (Bruce Greenwood) taunts him with the memory of his deceased father, a heroic Starfleet officer. Never one to decline a dare, Kirk thinks he can do just as well and joins the Starfleet recruits. Before he can graduate, however, all officers are called upon to join an armada replying to a distress call from Vulcan. A rogue Romulan vessel under the command of a Captain Nero (Eric Bana) has appeared out of nowhere, bent on destruction and looking for an \\"Ambassador Spock\\".<br /><br />\\"Star Trek\\" movies tend to throw out the rules and regulations upon which Starfleet relies to enforce its ideals, making the officers into loose canons. Here, we get a chaotic chain of command to go with Dan Mindel's shaky, spinning camera. This allows for a lot of arguing, disorder, and an express route to the command of the Enterprise for Kirk. Director J.J. Abrams consciously emulated a \\"Star Wars\\" pace, which belies the basically bureaucratic nature of Starfleet. He takes the inspiration too far in a silly sequence on an ice planet that is straight out of \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\". There are some anachronisms and inconsistencies that Trekkers will probably not like. I think it owes much of its appeal to images that allude to the original television series, but this \\"Star Trek\\" is kind of an endearing mess.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2009 single disc): Bonus features are one featurette, a Gag Reel (6 min), and an audio commentary. \\"A New Vision\\" (20 min) interviews director J.J. Abrams, the film's producers, and some of the creative crew about the Star Wars influence and making things look real by doing as much in-camera as possible, minimizing visual effects. The audio commentary is by J.J. Abrams and producers Bryan Burk, Alex Kurtman, Damon Lindelof, and Roberto Orci. It is conversational but contains a lot of information.

Dolby True HD is one of my favorite sound formats, and it's perfect for STAR TREK.  This is one of the best Blu Ray releases I have ever owned.  I also love the digital copy for itunes.  The movie kicks ass no matter what size screen you watch it on.  Amazon has done it again with their AMAZON EXCLUSIVE series.  The replica of the Starship Enterprise is just plain fantastic.  I love the fact that it is a scaled replica, and also that it is metal as opposed to plastic.  The detail is awesome.  It stands on its own, and does not easily topple over.  The sturdy insignia base is one of the best attributes of the replica.  The limited edition size also adds to the appeal.  To date this is the best and most fan conscious replica set I have seen or owned.  Top notch Amazon.  I hope to see Amazon continue to raise the bar in the AMAZON EXCLUSIVE series.  Movie of the year... Collectible of the year.
6305428042|5.0|Purchased this for a Halloween \\"Family\\" movie night for a group of volunteers and their families.  This was such a funny movie and was perfect for Halloween. Can't believe Sarah Jessica Parker was in it! Not to scary for the young ones but us oldies enjoyed it also. Can't go wrong with Disney.
0385504225|2.0|In a move of foolishly being thrifty, I opted for one of the less expensive book sellers on Amazon to send me this best seller.  The low price came with a long delivery time estimate.  Finally, when the delivery date came, I contacted the company through Amazon and quickly got a refund.  However, I have still not read the book!  I think this experience may make me a candidate for a Kindle!!
1593975635|5.0|This is a must listen to audio book , Dan Brown has done it again!!  This book holds your intrest throughout !!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001GM28HO|5.0|Opening up with the single \\"Just Dance\\" its an energy packed album throughout.   If your expecting the same synthesizer drum covered with a sensual voice well your right in some way , but this is still so much more it has many great songs like Poker Face , Paparazzi , Brown eyes , paper gangsta , And just dance.  I recommend buying this album.
0061841935|4.0|I enjoy watching Ferguson and wanted to know more about him.  Hearing his story in his own voice is just the right touch.
B001KMB6X2|2.0|Nope,I'm not buying it--either the movie itself or the premise that deep inside this is a really good movie ruined by bad editing, inattentive audiences, or the evil designs of the Tooth Fairy.  Babylon AD is an almost incomprehensible set of action sequences set mostly in a Mad Max post-apocalyptic future, and nothing more.  Vin hits people, Vin shoots people, people hit and shoot Vin, and stuff blows up all over the place, and nothing else in the movie is anything more than a thinly disguised way to get from one action sequence to another.  Does that make it a bad movie?  Depends on your criteria, I guess.  I thought my time had been wasted, but then, you might not.  Just don't expect more than things going boom.
B001OQCV24|3.0|There are many great scenes of destruction in this film, but 2012 lacks the realism I would have hoped for. There are far too many scenes where John Cusack is driving just ahead of a crack, or a caving landscape, almost like a surfer on the crest of the wave. I feel the movie dissipates a lot of its potential drama by being too cute and predictable with the protagonists always just getting out of the way of crashing buildings in the nick of time. And when people do get killed it often seems inconsequential as we simply aren't made to care about them. There are a few scenes that reminded me of the \\"Poseidon Adventure\\", which then led me to contemplate the difference between these two films. The \\"Poseidon Adventure\\" was a drama built up around believable characters who we empathized with, and who we felt a real sense of tragedy with when they died, but \\"2012\\", for the most part, fails to do this, and instead gives us a host of parodies, and largely comical characters, that we care so little for. This film will probably satisfy people just enough, but it could have been so much more. It is interesting to note that Roland Emmerich's first film was \\"The Noah's Ark Principle\\". He seems to have come full circle with this movie.
B0029O08WA|4.0|The album has several good songs that you wouldn't be able to get without buysing the cd. So it's worth it.
B001AVCFJM|3.0|If based on the cast and how well the actors portrayed the characters I would give this 4.75 stars. The movie, if based on plot it would only recieve 1, maybe 1.5 stars. The plot was horrible, I was fine up until the scene when Kirk enters the bar and thats when things went down hill. The major plus about this movie was that Zachary Quinto played Spock so well that it carried the movie. The only major flaw with the cast was casting Zoe as Uhura, Michelle was and still is very beautiful, I thought that there were much better, less skinny actresses that could have played this part well. I found it hard to believe that JJ Abrams could find young, hotter actors to play the males but she was his choice. Not that she unattractive or a bad actress but she did not look the part. I also thought that for a movie that is over 2 hrs long, more time could have been spent on scotty, mccoy, and sulu. I hope part two has a better plot.
0316001821|2.0|I love mysteries and thrillers of all kinds, and dramatic fiction that is unique and challenging.  This book didn't fit into any of these catagories for me. I can't deny its popularity, but I can say it wasn't my cup of tea.<br />I was glad when I finished it.
B002KSPKRS|2.0|I was skeptical about buying this item with the mixed reviews but I knew that Amazon guarantees all purchases and the return process is easy so I thought I would risk it. The headphones were comfortable to me they didn't hurt my ears like I have heard other people say. The audio quality was good most of the time however quite often the sound would crackle and pop which was quite annoying. Also the people I talked to on XBOX live said that their voice was echoing and I had to disconnect the xbox live connection from the headphones and plug it back in to get it to stop.. I had to do this about 3 or 4 times an hour which was REALLY annoying. Overall this is not worth the money which is why I boxed it back up and shipped it to Amazon for a refund.
B002H3F7F6|4.0|I have been a fan of the Police and Sting for ages. The only part of Sting's career I have avoided are his last couple solo records. Until now. This album is almost like a good movie to me instead of a collection of songs. It really does reflect the mystery, enchantment, sadness and also hope of the winter season. This not a cd for the car stereo, but rather a night time candle light or fireside cd while the cold winds blow outside. And although I have listened to the album once, I am actually saving repeated listens of this disc to do just that. This is a nice work of art.  ***I highly recommend purchasing the version of this album that includes a DVD showing the recording process as well as wonderful commentary by Sting himself.It really sets the mood and explains the context of this album.***
0553154540|5.0|I hated the original Willy Wonka movie. Gene Wilder was too smarmy, Charlie too bland and the Oompa-Loompas way too creepy. Hence, I saw no reason to read the book that inspired my loathing.  But when I learned that Roald Dahl, author of the book, had actually dissociated himself from the Wonka adaptation, I though that maybe, just maybe, I might like the book.<br /><br />And I loved it!!<br /><br />The book outdoes the movie in every way. Charlie and his extended family are dirt poor and hence always hungry. A yearly birthday candy bar is all they can afford. The other children, winners of Wonka's Golden Tickets, are hopelessly sniveling, selfish, spoiled and self-absorbed. When they visit Wonka's chocolate factory, they are dispatched by their own greed and lack of discipline. The scenes where Veruca Salt is disposed of by a gang of shell-shucking squirrels is perfect. Dahl's Wonka is hyperkinetic, elfin and passionate about candy. He seems not to know or care where the disappearing children have gone. The Oompa Loompas are not the lumpish candy-men of the movie but a race of tiny people transplanted willingly to the factory. The only slightly disturbing part of the book was the way the nasty kiddos were got rid of, since they could have been drowned, incinerated, or blown up like balloons. But even this discomfort is addressed by book's end.<br /><br />The best part of the book was Dahl's inventive cleverness about dream up new and wonderful candies. Edible pillows, cavity-filling caramels and sweets that let you spit in many colors were just a few of his delectable concoctions. As were the long songs sung by the Oompa Loompas to celebrate the removal of bad kids. Schindelman's illustrations gave just enough of a hint at the action without taking the reader's imagination entirely off the hook. Dahl's moral sense is an important subtext throughout the book. Greed and boorishness are punished; virtue, good manners and self-restraint are rewarded. Compare that with the ethical confusion of the Wilder film.<br /><br />Definitely one of my favorite books in search of an adaptation that is true to the Dahl's spirit, which rewards the habit of reading books and other good behavior, even among the needy.the Wilder film.

0060574216|5.0|Bought the book after my last breakup. I was so fed-up with not knowing where the problem was. Fighting about nothing and making her upset even though all my intentions were good. I had no clue why we were fighting. I wanted to do something about it, read a few pages of this book and then bought it myself.  Great book, very stereotypical but everything fits in how I used to think. Never knew I was such an typical Man. :) Its primary focus is explaining our differences and it does it very good. Now I know why women are not logical, and why she is upset for no reason. :)    It also gives a method for dealing with your inner issues and feelings. Stuff you might not know you have until someone points them out.  The book goes both ways, helping both men and women.     They should teach this in school!
B001GJ2ZCA|5.0|I'll admit, I was a little skeptical about buying this album at first......seeing as how I was basing my reason for buying it soly on the hit single \\"use somebody\\".  I thought it was going to be another album that had 3, maybe 4, alright songs on it.  I was way off!!! The first time I put the CD in and pushed play, I was hooked.  \\"Use Somebody\\" isn't even my favorite song on the album.....it's maybe 5th, maybe! :)  I've had if for 4 days now and haven't taken it out of my player once!  I just put the album on repeat and let it play over and over.  Kings of Leon is now one of my favorite groups! I've now ordered their other albums and can't wait until they come in!  I just wish I would have knew about them earlier so I could have been listening to the group longer!  Buy the album, you won't regret it!!
0765350386|4.0|Mistborn has several strengths.      First it's solidly in the fantasy genre (I'm not a fan of those novels that stray too far from the high road).    Second, the magic, called Allomancy, which is based on the ingestion and use of metals, is unique, highly interesting, and serves the story well.  It gives the main characters unusual but believable powers.  Third, the secondary, or underlying plotline is dark and evocative enough to make me want to continue with this series.    There are weaknesses also, the main one being that the characters talk too much, and explain things that I'd rather be shown in a way that I can discern for myself.  The other weakness worth mentioning is that Sanderson's world-building skills, so essential in fantasy, are either under-displayed here, or are lacking.    Still, it's a good read, barely four stars, but four stars nenetheless.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|My kids were just at the wrong age, too young, for me to have gotten into South Park, so \\"Team America\\" was kind of a revelation to me. The movie is vulgar, politically incorrect and oh so crude. But it is also a very smart combination of writing, smart puppeteering and topical satire that is just has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />Team America is a group of star-spangled fighters who take on terrorists. They tend to be a little quick on the draw, and often cause more damage to those they want to save than the bad guys. The opening scene, in which the team blows the living hell out of Central Paris, sets the stage for the rest of the film.<br /><br />It's hard sometimes to know with Trey and Stone where satire ends and crude ethnic stereotyping begins. One American character bluffs his way past a couple of Arab guards by repeating variations on \\"Durka durka.\\" Is this making fun of the America belief that foreign culture and language is so easily adopted?  Or that Arabic is barbaric nonsense? Hard to say. Then there is the film's portrayal of many of Hollywood's leftist artists as terror-pandering loons. Alec Baldwin comes in for a particular savaging, but then so do Susan Sarandon, Janeane Garafalo, Matt Damon and many others. Trey and Stone are notoriously evenhanded in targeting left and right, though I have to say that the right gets off rather easy in this film. It's a choice being portrayed as narrow-mindedly militaristic v getting your head blown off.<br /><br />Anyway, Team America finds its way to North Korea, where lead bad guy, Kim Jong Ill, is the terrorist puppet master who pulls the metaphorical strings of terrorists around the globe. Sometimes I wonder whether the real Kim, already on the downslope of the sanity slide, would see this movie by itself as a pretext to harry the West. Let's hope that never happens. In the film, he is a sadistic crime master with a \\"ronery\\" (lonely) heart of gold. His signature song, \\"I'm so Ronery\\" bewails his lack of company at the top, while making uncomfortable fun of the East Asian pronunciation. It's this kind of combination hi- and low-brow humor that make the film irresistible and enchanting for nearly every taste..<br /><br />For a kid like me who grew up in the 60's with shows like \\"Fireball XL-5\\" that feature the hop-skip motion of puppets, this film was a great nostalgia trip. Even a 6-year old kid in 1962 watching characters flop into their jet pilot's seats knew he was watching something bizarre and memorable. \\"Team America\\" ramps up the inanity of the puppeteering technique, inserting all manner of violence and sexuality that the producers of \\"Fireball\\" could never have imagined. Trey and Stone pay tribute to the genre while mercilessly exploiting and expanding it. The film's music adds greatly to the sense of irreverent fun. A love song between two characters (\\"Pearl Harbor sucked, and I love you\\") trashes Ben Affleck and takes a swipe at smarmy movie love songs.  The film's theme song is not only rude, violent and jingoistic, but has a country flavor that fits right into the \\"I'm proud to be an American\\" genre of contemporary popular patriotic music.<br /><br />Team America is not a film for the gentle or pious. Church folk - stay away! But if you have a certain kind of twisted humor, can stand watching puppets blowing each other away with automatic weapons and explosives, and don't mind watching naked, articulated puppets engage in every graphic sexual situation imaginable, then put this film on your cinematic bucket list.<br /><br />Should you pick up or watch \\"Team America\\"?

0061564893|5.0|Zhu Di was the fourth son of Zhu YuanZhang. Zhu Di rose to power from a peasant to a emperor through the help of the Eunuch Lord, Zheng He. The Mongols ruled China since 1279 under Kublai Khan. In 1382, China defeated the Mongols at Kun Ming. The Mongol prisoners were mutilated into Eunuchs. The Eunuchs were the hidden power of the Empire and Zhu Di tapped into this hidden reserve to capture the empire. Zheng He original name was Ma He. Ma He was a captured Mongol prisoner. Ma He changed his name to Zheng He and became a Muslim.<br /><br />Zhu Di rise to power began after becoming the Prince of Yen. Zhu Di move the place from NanJing to Ta-Tu or Bejing in 1387, after 30 years fighting with the Mongols. Zhu Yunwen become Emperor after Hong Wu death and sought to kill Zhu Di suspecting him to be a Mongol. Zhu Di disquises himself and goes into hiding as a vagrant living as a begger. Zhu-Di turns to Zheng He and Zheng He gather forces, 800 men from the Enunucy reserve, fight battles against the Emperors forces and win. Zhu Yuawen is angered and sought to destroy the rebellion. Zhu Yuawen sends a half a million men to destroy Zhu-Di rebellion. The season is wrong, winter is approaching, the men were not clothed for the cold and most freeze to death. In 1402, Zhu Di marches South on Nanjing and the Eunuchs throw open the gates and Zhu Di seizes the Dragon throne.<br /><br />Zhu Di created a Maritime Empire. The Armada was composed of 250 treasure ships, a total of 3,500 vessels, 1,350 patrol vessels, 400 freighters for hauling grain and other commodities. The Maritime Empire was a tribute system. The tribute system gave foreign countries the right to visit Beijing. Zhu Di foreign policy was to pursue by trade alliances and provide firepower to protect the friendly countries and firepower to quash insurrections. Zheng He set into sequence the voyage to collect tribute from the barbarians beyond the seas and bring civilization under Confucian Harmony.<br /><br />Zhu Di local ambitions included replace of the Great Wall and repairing the Grand Canal and the Yong-Le-Dadian. Over 300,000 men were allocated to clean and repair the Grand Canal. The Grand Canal was needed to bring grain to Beijing to feed the large armies and other workers. The importing of grain to Beijing caused food shortages through China. The Grand Canal was a 1,800 kilometers long channel for North and South commerce. The Yong-Le-Dadian was 4,000 volumes and used over 2,800 scholars to compose a 50 million character encyclopedia of Chinese commerce throughout the world.<br /><br /> Zheng He trade ships were 480 feet in length and 180 feet across with red silk sails, 16 internal water tight compartments, 36 foot rudder. The freight ships were capable of hauling 20,000 tons of cargo. The Armada had over 30,000 men. Zheng He created a language school in 1407 called Si Yi Guan which produced 16 language interpreters; languages included: African, Arabic, Indian, Persian, Swahili, Hindi, and Tail.<br /><br />Zhu Di sent an army to crush the rebellion in Vietnam. The Vienamese were required to read Chinese Classics but abandoned the policy in 1428. The rebellion started when Qui Ly, in 1404 usurp the throne. Qui Ly simplified taxation, introduced a health care system, restrict land acquisition at the expense of the peasant, and created a national entity. Le Loi continued the war after Qui Ly and gained independence from China in 1428.<br /><br />Zhu Di, son is Zhu Guozhi.

B0026JWDQW|2.0|I never heard of Paolo Nutini until a few weeks ago when he was a guest performer on \\"The Graham Norton Show\\" on BBC America. I'd never heard anything quite like \\"Lead in My Pencil\\" before, and I ordered a copy of \\"Sunny Side Up\\" the next morning.   Apparently Nutini is quite popular in England, and is trying to break into the American market. His voice is pretty good, and he has a good selection of songs, but I don't think he's going to make it here in the US. His voice is very unique, and his musical style doesn't fit into a particular genre--his songs reflect country, music hall, folk, swing. This variety of styles makes the album enjoyable to listen to, but impossible to categorize for radio play. I'm afraid if you don't listen to Graham Norton, you're not likely to have heard of Paolo Nutini. And that's a shame.

B001H5X7JS|5.0|OK, so I am not a big Ben Stiller fan. As far as I am concerned, the man really cannot act and his films are gross, stupid and exploitative. But Tropic Thunder came recommended from my artsy kid, so I felt obligated to check it out. And glad I am that I did.<br /><br />I don't ask or much from a film -- original ideas, tight writing, expressive acting, and a minimum of plot holes. Thankfully, craft is written all over this film. Stiller takes deadly aim at the Vietnam movie genre. The deliciously convoluted plot has Stiller's platoon shooting a Vietnam film that is far behind schedule and over budget. The only solution seems to be to put the spoiled actors in a warlike situation. But a series of events lands the boys in a real shooting war, and they need to use their meager wits to survive. By building his platoon from a potpourri of the genre's types, Stiller get to send up Nam films, the film industry, actors, and the genre's stock characters. His platoon has all the ingredients of the classic Nam film. There's the jive-talking black sergeant; the swaggering white honcho (Stiller), the nerd, the fat white guy (Jack Black) and the young black \\"blood\\". The combination gives Stiller the chance to set his types against each other to destroy old stereotypes. Taking method acting to the extreme, the older black character (Morton Downey, Jr.) is actually a white Aussie who underwent a pigmentation change for the movie. He speaks a 1960s black jive that thoroughly infuriates the \\"real\\" black character, a rapper who purveys a more contemporary \\"street\\" lingo. Behind this crew of misfits is Nick Nolte, playing a bedraggled, muttering, handless Vietnam war vet who wrote a book about his Nam exploits. An amazing Tom Cruise plays an out-of-control film mogul who strikes terror into his crews, even via teleconference.<br /><br />Some of Stiller's swipes and plotting are pretty obvious. There's the big hetero character who turns out not to be and the big Asian crime boss who turns out not to be. And Stiller really has just two acting faces: stupidly confused and confusedly stupid. But, giving credit where credit is due, he was ridden the stupid horse all he way to the bank and beyond. Some folks might be offended by Stiller's portrayal of retarded \\"Simple Jack,\\" a recurring reference to a role from his character's past that demonstrates his low-rent talent. But it worked for Forrest Gump, didn't it?<br /><br />In Tropic Thunder, Stiller is at his parodic best. Don't miss the fake previews (I did) that set up the characters in their own normal genres. And don't miss the numerous riffs on successful Nam movies -- Stiller's take-off on the iconic scenes from Apocalypse Now, for instance, make that film look like a parody of itself.<br /><br />The second disk, filled with the de rigueur cast interviews, is just so-so. I don't care about how they used CGI sparingly, and I only saw enough of the storyboarding to begin to whet my appetite. The film's visuals are terrific and stand on their own -- better to watch Disk 1 twice. But lay down the subtitles, because a lot of the terrific writing is drowned out by copter noise and deliberately garbled delivery.<br /><br />Great Stuff! I might go against my better judgment and pick up another couple Stiller films!. And Stiller really has just two acting faces: stupidly confused and confusedly stupid.

B002NXSRX4|1.0|This movie is close to one of the worst I have ever seen. The plot, special effects, and acting are all downright horrible. This should have been a release-to-DVD movie or ABC miniseries.
B0028T6XXY|4.0|Yes, I liked the music CD.  Didn't much care for the DVD... a little too self obsorbed. Worth the money for the music though!
B002S0OBG4|1.0|What a manipulative, tripe sack of garbage this \\"movie\\" was. The first 45min are a complete and I do emphasize a *complete* waste of time - God honest I nearly fell asleep twice, forcing my head up before I nodded off. It's incredibly dull, and the \\"scares\\" amount to the kind of things you'll see at your local haunted funhouse, like broken mirrors and bumping sounds.     And this is NOT an assault on low-budget filmmaking at all because I in fact enjoy independent films, when and if they're done properly and the filmmaker has talent.     However, the filmmaker succeeded in copying nearly every facet of Blair Witch, right down to its conclusion, and relocating it inside of a house (and I did in fact enjoy Blair Witch because the director was talented and went out of his/her way to blur the line between reality/documentary and fiction, which was absent in Paranormal Activity.)    This \\"film\\" amounted to a poor, mediocre, and shameless copy of another film notwithstanding a new setting. I'll quote a fellow movie goer as we walked out of the theater:    \\"I want a refund.\\"

B002NXSRVG|5.0|This movie is really great.  We bought it for our sons after trying to watch the horrible transformers 2 movie (never again).  Unlike that movie, this is a fairly wholesome movie, there is some killing and a few cuss words, but all in all it just action packed fun.  It kept my sons attention and explained some things about Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes (like why he never talks & how they are related).  If your looking for a father-son movie that has a lot of action yet is wholesome, this is it..... I can't believe the ratings on this are not better.
B00003CXDU|4.0|This movie was bought not expecting a great plot, I wasn't disappointed. Still liked it.
B0009F2EPU|3.0|I remember watching this Boulez/Chéreau Ring when it was broadcast (!) on American tv (!!) around 1981 or 82.  I was glued to the tv for 4 nights as this visually arresting and musically compelling cycle unfolded.  This was before the era of video taping so I did not see this production again until it was released on commercial videos several years later.  I was less smitten by this event than before, noticing a few flops in the production and being more critical of some of the singing, though I liked Boulez's conducting more than I had before.  I have a set of recordings from the premiere season (1976) with a very different cast of singers and a very disgruntled orchestra which played pretty crudely for Boulez who they did not like at all.  The eruption of hissing and booing at the start of Act 3 of Götterdämmerung was really shocking to me.  The audience was expressing HATRED for the hydroelectric dam appearing again, something they had expected to be finished with after the opening scene of Rheingold.  It's reappearance was too much for them and they erupted.      Now it is all very mild.  By the end of the run in this production was greeted with cheers of approval.  How fickle public opinion is.  It is refreshing to see new viewpoints expressed in telling Wagner's mythological epic but,sadly, things have gone off the rails with the ascendence of the 'Konzept' producers who are more interested in themselves than Wagner, or us.    Chéreau and Harry Kupfer were the granddaddies of Konzept productions.  Whereas Kupfer slid into a rut of predictable imagery Chéreau has continued to grow in a more a imaginative fashion, note his 'From the House of the Dead' currently showing at the Met.  It's modern and bleak but so is the story.  Some of the other current wunderkinds of Konzept productions could easily have set Janacek's opera in a grocery store or shopping mall or something like that.  Chéreau has more self-control, and sense.      His early Ring at Bayreuth is a sensible production within the framework of non-traditional settings for Wagner's masterpieces.  And he does not offend, but the original illusion of sure-footedness has started to crack and the production now looks slightly gimcrack.    The sets are beautiful and the direction of the singers is tightly controlled but not so tight as to thwart freedom of movement, especially with some of the better singer-actors like Gwyneth Jones' Brünnhilde and Hermann Becht's Alberich.    Overall the singing is very good, if not in the same league as the casts from Bayreuth's Golden Age of the 1950s and early 1960s when Wieland Wagner was hiring the best possible singers from around the world.  By the 1980s things had deteriorated in that department and Wagnerians found themselves settling for make-do singers and conductors, with the occasional brilliant production, notably 'Der fliegende Holländer' in the late '70s.    I mention Gwyneth Jones right off the bat because she is the star of this production.  Many complain about her vocal inconsistencies but I hear a soprano who has the measure of this huge part, and the voice to sing it and, even more of an asset, a great theatrical sense and ability to express it in her fine acting.  She is the main reason to see this production on film.  There are other important performances in this show, notably the Siegmund and Sieglinde of Peter Hofmann (his world debut for all intents and purposes) and Jeannine Altmeyer.  Act 1 of Walküre is white hot, though the staging is pretty disappointing, beyond their impassioned embraces which are very convincing, almost blush-making.    Matti Salminen makes his international debut as the giant Fasolt.  Sadly the giants' costumes are one of the glaring failures of this production, but Salminen and Fritz Hübner sing through these impediments with great power.  Salminen's Hunding is one of the great vocal assumptions of this role on record (film) and his performances are another compelling, if comparatively minor reason to view these films.  Hermann Becht is an outstanding Alberich, vocally and histrionically.  And Heinz Zednik's Loge carries the first opera almost solely upon his shoulders, which are draped in a long white sheet.  The other great singing comes from Ortrun Wenkel's Erda.      Donald McIntyre is a good Wotan, within the limitations of his less-than-Wagnerian baritone.  It's an attractive voice, he's an attractive man and he fits perfectly into Chéreau's Konzept as the 19th century landed gentleman/god who is stricken by a guilty conscience for his treachery against the working classes (Chéreau took G.B. Shaw's book 'The Perfect Wagnerite' to heart and has based this production on that Marxist point of view and hatred for the aristocracy).      There is one galvanizing moment, in particular, that has stuck in my mind since the first time I saw it; the moment in the last act of Walküre when Wotan scoops the sleeping Brünnhilde up into his arms where she dangles limply like a dead child. It is a deeply moving moment.  The singing up to this point in this cycle has been of a consistently high level.    It is with the last two operas that problems begin to intrude with the cast.  Manfred Jung sings well but he was a disappointment compared to the original Siegfrieds in this production (who quit after the first season), René Kollo and Jess Thomas.  Jung had a nice, strongish lyric tenor and he pushes enough to be credible in the louder moments, like the Forging Scene, but he is pushed to the limits and it shows.  He's an unusual looking man, not unattractive, just unusual, the one-browed type (not an inapposite thing for a Siegfried) but he also exudes the air of a certified accountant that is out of tune with his primitive character.  He's a make-do singer who does not detract but neither does he satisfy.  He's also a mediocre actor.  Heinz Zednik's vivid Mime saves the first act of Siegfried with his lively and subtly nuanced performance.The casting of Götterdämmerung is good if not outstanding.  Franz Mazura stands out as Gunther and Jeannine Altmeyer is luxury casting as Gutrune.  Fritz Hübner is not in the same league as the original Hagen (Karl Ridderbusch, who also quit after the first season) but he does what he can, hobbled a bit by the Konzept of the Gibichungs being a parvenu family of rich businessmen, Plutocractic peers if you will.    There are some gorgeous sets by Peduzzi; notably the 2nd scene of Rheingold with its sunken columns and giant clock, the 3rd act of Walküre with the Pironesi-like broken wall upon which Brünnhilde is lain to rest, and the forest in Siegfried with the toy-like dragon hauled by stagehands (something you wouldn't think would work but it does).  I also happened to like the hydroelectric dam that the Rhine Daughters frolic upon in their glad rags.  It's a powerful, potent image that evokes great masses of water and was, at the time, a relief from the usual dark green rocky riverbed with 3 middle-aged singers attempting to allure by waving their arms and jumping around all over the place.  These 3 prostitute daughters are more dignified than that, and therefore sing more in-tune than the usual lot.    Boulez is a swift Wagnerian, occasionally a bit glib, but he doesn't gloss over the profound bits, he simply eschews lingering in the often somnolent manner of James Levine.    Having seen this film again 30 years after the tv broadcast I have to say that I wouldn't spend the money on the dvds.  What I did instead was to go to Ebay and snag an original un-opened set of the lps that came in that red and black cardboard carrying case just before the era of the cd blew vinyl out of the stores.  I think listening is the best way to experience this good performance as the production becomes more of an incumbrance, unlike the theater of my mind.

Late in life all right, I'm 85, but for about 20 years since my triple bypass I've steered clear of red meat. Ate lots of fish, fruits, veggies and nuts. My numbers were pretty good and at least I haven't had any more heart procedures, but I still noticed a sharp rise in energy within 72 hours of going vegan. As a result, I've gone off of several of my medications and continue to feel fine without pumping so many toxic pills into my body.       Unless you're part of the food or medical community, THE CHINA STUDY will blow your mind. You owe it to yourself to read it--right away.    ----Warren Jamison
B002NWRMVS|2.0|Have you met Ms. Jones?  Rickie Lee, that is.  Listening to \\"The Fall,\\" brought to mind that earlier, similarly named artist, the complicated, esoteric one.  Other musicians and bands that popped into my head were Blondie, The Pretenders & Natalie Merchant.  The performer I didn't think of was Norah Jones herself, or at least the Norah Jones who first appeared on the scene a mere six years ago.  She was a kinder, gentler version of the artist we're hearing from now, and, for my money, a far more successful one.<br /><br />Despite the whimsical cover photo, there's very little that's light about \\"The Fall,\\" not much that will bring a smile to your face.  Electric guitars have replaced acoustic ones, which is pretty much a metaphor for how things have changed.  The style is harder, edgier, darker; personally, I find it all vaguely depressing.  What's crystal clear is that Ms. Jones has made a conscious decision to eschew the mainstream, or at least set sail in a completely different one than she's charted heretofore; she's earned that right and exercises it vigorously.<br /><br />\\"The Fall\\" sent me back to Ms. Jones' first two albums.  Listening to \\"Don't Know Why,\\" \\"Come Away With Me,\\" \\"Shoot the Moon\\" and \\"Those Sweet Words,\\" among others, it occurred to me that the only thing an album needs to be successful is great songs.  And that's exactly what's most missing here.  (Repeated hearings have actually reinforced how little is worth returning to.)  Happily, Ms. Jones' voice remains one of the most distinct of the past decade, and it's a pleasure to listen to.  But the next time I want a fix, \\"The Fall\\" is not what I'll be falling into.
B002H3F7F6|4.0|As a singer in a choir and an a cappella group, and a lover of music, I've always been slightly annoyed that people want to go straight to Christmas without going through Advent, and there is not enough Advent music out there.  Advent is a time when it's getting progressively darker and colder.  \\"They\\" put Christmas in late December because it's the time of year when, even though most of winter is yet to come, the days miraculously start getting longer again-- but that only comes after the introspection and diminishing of hope in the Advent season.    My point is that Sting has focused on that cold and dark, which is so important if you're going to appreciate the warmth and light and hope that Christmas represents.  So what he's made is an Advent album.  I don't listen to much pop music, but when I heard him sing The Snow It Melts the Soonest on NPR, it reminded me of the Incredible String Band and all that cool druidic/Child ballad-y stuff from my youth.  That's beside my point about Advent, but I wanted to make it anyway.  I bought it and I've been listening to it and enjoying it.      I gave it only four stars because I generally like either the serious, non-pop iterations of these songs, or else the totally out-there ISB. I get annoyed by the melisma that's so popular now, and that I just heard him do on Track 8 as I write this.

B001ED7C58|4.0|I love the \\"Twilight\\" soundtrack.  Of course, it includes the best songs from the movie, but also works really well as a stand-alone album.  The best tracks on the album, in my opinion, are \\"Supermassive black hole\\" by Muse, \\"Spotlight\\" by Mutemath, \\"Decode\\" by Paramore, and \\"Tremble for my beloved\\" by Collective Soul.  These are all up-tempo and rock.  I think the songs fit the movie well, especially their respective scenes.  My only requests for this album are to have Rob Pattinson's other song \\"Let me sign\\" included, especially since it was featured very prominently at the climax of the movie; and I would have liked to have \\"Clair de lune\\" by Debussy as it is the only piece of music ever actually named in the Twilight novel as well as in the movie.  The only other change I would make would be to move \\"Spotlight\\" to the lead off track since it has a built in introduction in the music and would have fit better at the beginning of the album instead of in the middle.  All in all, I love this soundtrack and listen to it repeatedly.

B001GCUER0|5.0|Season 1 of \\"Mad Men\\" was brilliant; Season 2 is even more so. Judging from the first two seasons, Matthew Weiner and the rest of the \\"Mad Men\\" crew are putting in a strong bid for the title of Greatest Television Program of All Time. As some previous reviewers have remarked, a lot of sins from Season 1 are coming home to roost in Season 2. We see the already troubled marriage of Don and Betty Draper (Jon Hamm, January Jones) turn rockier still; the struggles of Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) with her family and her Catholic faith; the continuing workplace humiliation of the shrewd, unflappable Joan Holloway (Christina Hendricks); the increasing cold-bloodedness of Roger Sterling (John Slattery), Peter Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser), \\"Duck\\" Phillips (Mark Moses), and Bert Cooper (Robert Morse). The characters are endlessly fascinating, the dialogue subtle and sharp, the period recreation of the early 1960s miraculous. The storyline takes surprising yet completely believable turns, and the cast is so great that my favorite actor on the show tends to be the one I happen to be watching at the time.<br /><br />My only caveat: \\"Mad Men,\\" like \\"Deadwood,\\" is not a show you can pick up by watching a random episode. To know what's going on and get the show's full impact, you need to begin at the beginning and progress in a completely orderly fashion. Season 2 of \\"Mad Men\\" is magnificent, but you won't realize how magnificent it is unless you've seen all of Season 1 first.
B0000UJL96|5.0|\\"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country\\" is....fun. Its also, like Wrath of Khan and The Voyage Home, smart, full of intrigue, packed with cool heroes and villians, with great emsemble acting, taut direction and a clever screenplay.<br />This time around, the Federation discovers their most hated enemy, the Klingons, are facing extinction. They set about wanting to make a peace pact with them, however reluctantly. Captain Kirk, who lost his son, David, to the murderous hand of the Klingons in \\"Search for Spock\\" definitely wants nothing to do with his foes. \\"Let Them Die\\" he says to Spock. Anyway, after a dinner meeting with Klingon representatives, their chancellor is assassinated, and Kirk and McCoy are framed. From this point on, the film takes on the tone of a detective story, with Spock and the rest of the Enterprise crew racing against time to clear their allies' names and find the true killer before all out war devastates the galaxy. Brilliant stuff, giving you the best of what the Star Trek mythology is all about. See it.

0882709194|1.0|I got a copy of this name-calling work of trash at my university. I originally saw \\"The Origin of Species\\" without seeing the \\"special introduction\\" and thought it would be good to have a copy of one of the most revolutionaries pieces of text, so I took one. However, I was disgusted when I skimmed through the introduction. Comfort is the master of pseudoscience and attempts to dismantle a theory well accepted by the biological community without even basic knowledge on the nature of evolution. His fallacious arguments are a sad attempt to keep a dieing belief alive and have little place in this world.    In addition, his book is very offensive. He says Darwin is a racist, connects his work to Nazism, and implies that without a God, there is no need for moral consequences, and thus anyone that does not adhere to a particular religion has no moral responsibility. I am unsure what to do with this book. I want to recycle it to counter the waste it produced, but at the same time, my hate for it is so overwhelming that I want to see it in flames. However, I am glad to say that most of my undergrad peers had the right set of mind: this book is pathetic. Please do not buy this.

0882709194|1.0|Ray Comfort's attempts to convert college students to creationism by distributing this book were laughable. Anyone with the slightest bit of critical thinking can see through the logical fallacies in Comfort's introduction, which misrepresents the science and which gives quotations entirely out of context in a way that alters meaning. This version is worth rescuing from the recycle bin to keep as a comedic cultural artifact, but if you're looking for the Origin for its own sake, get a different version that actually includes Darwin's epigraphs, drawings, and other things that Comfort deliberately omitted from this one.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|It was easy to dismiss Moon as a [[ASIN:B000Q66J1M 2001: A Space Odyssey]] clone based on the trailers, claustrophobic space station setting and the HAL 9000-like robot assistant (GERTY). It is a surprisingly fun space mystery and I'm glad I was wrong. The film opens with a commercial from Lunar Industries, promising a safe, dependable, and clean energy source from the moon. Then it cuts right to the lunar surface where astronaut/miner Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is preparing a cargo of helium for launch back to Earth.<br /><br />With 2 weeks left of his contract, he is more than ready to go home. Living in isolation on the dark side of the moon for the past 3 years, with the satellite dish down, his only link with Earth are company transmissions, delayed TV feeds of sporting events, and the occasional pre-recorded video relay from his wife. With not another living soul on the moon, Sam occupies himself by talking to his plants, carving a miniature model of his town, and talking to GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey). Sam thinks he's going insane from the psychological stress of isolation and starts seeing things. He scalds his hand on boiling water and later causes a serious crash with his rover, knocking out one of the giant combine harvesters. This is where the real mystery begins, as Sam discovers that he is not alone. I won't spoil the surprise, but what follows is an entertaining and suspenseful experience.<br /><br />GERTY's monotone diction, calm demeanor, and design are unmistakably inspired by HAL 9000, a perhaps deliberate decision by the filmmakers to heighten the sense of mystery and play on our preconceived notions of the sci-fi genre built up by other films. He also has a camera \\"eye\\" like HAL, and we've also seen the maniacal ship's AI Otto from Wall-E. We don't know if GERTY's pleasantly warm voice and smiley face LCD display means he is genuinely helpful or if he's concealing a secret agenda. Director Duncan Jones is using our expectations against us, and this is part of the fun of unraveling the drama of Moon.<br /><br />The film draws influences from other films like [[ASIN:B000UBMWG4 Blade Runner]], [[ASIN:B00012FXAE Aliens]], and of course, 2001 (whose vision of the future is clean and white interiors with bright lights) and [[ASIN:B000063UR1 Silent Running]]. With a 90 min runtime, the film is short. Made on a tiny budget (by today's standards) of $5 million, it is carried by the remarkable performance of Rockwell whose shows many sides of the Sam character. Interiors are very convincingly designed, with some lunar surface shots and CG that are perhaps a bit too heavy on lens flare. Except one instance of backal nudity (unfortunately, it's from Rockwell and not the lovely Dominique McElligott), a scene of nasty vomiting and a fist-fight, nothing too graphic is shown. The ending could've used maybe 3-5 minutes more of exposition as it did feel a bit rushed, but don't let me dissuade you from watching this wonderful film.

The \\"intro\\" is FULL of blatant lies, hypocrisy and christian propaganda. \\"Ray Comfort\\" is NOT in any stretch of the imagination qualified to be in the same book as Darwin. He knows nothing of what he speaks and constantly shows it. He attacks Darwin and every other religion with fraudulent and distorted statements. At the end of the \\"intro\\" he basically tells you to accept jesus now or go to hell.    Yes, evolution is not a perfect theory but that doesn't mean it's completely wrong.

I would love to read a well thought-out opposing viewpoint to evolution but this was so riddled with fraudulent statements, twisting of information, hypocrisy and blatant lies it was laughable.
B0027REDK2|4.0|I got this CD along with the Hammersmith 82 DVD.  The music on the CD is what it is supposed to be, according to the CD label and track listing, but when I put it on my computer, it reads as Duran Duran Rio 2000. Same goes for the 2nd CD, with the old demos and night versions. When I put it in the computer, it came up with the Big Thing cover and the track listing for the Big Thing CD...Really weird...When you actually PLAY the CD, it is what it is supposed to be.  I think the whole production of the CD got rushed and it's a careless job, which is a shame. I don't know what to do with it, to send it back and try again, or just keep it and deal with it, since it is what it says it is, as far as the actual CD itself....I do like the old photos, and the narrative of the CD...I just think the record company should have paid more attention to the overall detail.

In fact no wildlife at all other than some kind of silly lizard and a porpoise.  Did they not want to pay off the animal rights loonies or what?      I did enjoy the movie.  Much better than average.
B0000214F0|5.0|Got the unrated version so that it wasn't all cut up.  I swear Americans are kind of backward at seeing flesh, but since I'm American I understand the Disney mentality - yet I guess that's what might spark more interest in these kinds of flix.  Plus Ed hadn't seen the full on version so I HAD to add it to our vid library collection.  A must-see IF you're mature enough to handle it.    The reason I say not historically accurate is that recent digs show that Caligula (Gaius Cesar) more than likely really DID try to invade Briton (aka Britain) and not just fight reeds; history notes that he died alone when leaving the gladiator games arena for lunch but his wife and child were indeed purported to have been killed as shown.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|This movie starts with a simple question from Richard Lobb of the National Chicken Council : \\"In a way, we're not producing chickens, we're producing food.  What this accomplishes is to produce a lot of food in a small amount of space at a very affordable price.  Let somebody explain to me what's wrong with that.\\"  Well, this film does explain very well what's wrong with that.<br /><br />The first point is that it is no good to treat animals as if they were mere *objects*.  You'll see chickens and beef up to their knees in their own droppings.  You'll also see chickens in their cages, not being able to carry even their own weight.  The animals are kept all the time in the dark, including for us.  It was very hard for the movie makers to obtain some footage from inside those chicken houses.<br /><br />The second point, linked in a way to the preceding one, is that our food can easily become contaminated with E-coli, due to the droppings the animals carry on their skin.  That's how food poisoning can occur in the slaughterhouse.<br /><br />Barbara Kowalcyk, mother of a 2.5 old year kid, lived through the most horrible experience anybody can suffer : the death of her child...  The reason : eating a ... hamburger...  \\"We put faith in our government to be protected, but we're not being protected at the most basic level\\", she says.  This is not an inconvenient truth - although this movie was produced by the same company that brought us the documentary with the same title.  This is an ugly truth.<br /><br />Can we do something about it ?  Absolutely.  \\"You can change the world, with every bite\\".  Switch to organics.  Even better would be to connect yourself again with the source of your food, of what you are eating, of what you are putting in your mouth !  The best thing to do would be to get involved with a local farmer you know and can trust.

Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth, and Hugh Grant led a stellar ensemble cast that was as committed to pitch-perfect little moments as it was to broad laughs and big romantic scenes.  All in all, the original \\"BJD\\" is right up there with the most charming of English comedies.    But you know what happens with Hollywood and good ideas - if there's a nickel to be made, then nothing is sacred.      Somehow Zellweger, Firth and Grant let their \\"people\\" talk them into making this absolutely soulless shell of a sequel.  On the Sequel Scale, with \\"Godfather II\\" at the top with an easy 10 and \\"Caddyshack 2\\" a zero, \\"Bridget Jones:  The Edge of Reason\\" rates about a 1.5.  The concept is stupid - Bridget is still dizzily in love with Darcy (Firth), and he does nothing at all wrong except be just too darn perfect for words.  But we must contrive some conflict, so Bridget concocts stupid sins on his part that even she realizes are stupid, but they are sufficient to create some distance between the two.      Look, in romantic comedies we expect a certain amount of cliche and coincidence - it comes with the territory.  But this sequel just isn't true to Bridget.  She learned in the first movie that Darcy really loved her, and she is a smart enough girl that she would never do the idiotic things she does in this movie.  That's one of her most endearing qualities - Bridget is smarter than the thin people in her world realize.  Stupid Bridget just ain't that interesting.    In this closed universe of profiteering, the filmmakers are so completely bereft of ideas that no sooner has Darcy left the stage in a semi-huff that Hugh Grant oozes back into Bridget's life, looking for a return to Bridget's arms.  This makes absolutely no sense - here's Grant (it makes no sense to refer to his name - he's playing Hugh Grant), jet-setting around the world for a fun TV show, apparently still sleeping with supermodels, and yet his number one goal seems to be to seduce Bridget.  Whaaaa?  If Grant's purpose was to get revenge on Darcy, then perhaps the movie might have been funny.  Not even Hugh Grant's charm can make this ridiculous character work.    We also get lots of contrived scenes demonstrating how the lovable Bridget gets herself into trouble.  When Bridget thinks she's pregnant, not only are the filmmakers content to fall back on the old \\"Let's watch the terrible skier fly down the mountain at top speed, leaving a trail of destruction while narrowly escaping death and screaming 'Whoooo!',\\" but they have her glide into a pharmacy (yes, a pharmacy) at the bottom of the slope (pretty prime real estate for a pharmacy), where she requests a birth control test, only to realize that she is in the one store in a German tourist town where nobody speaks English.  Hardy har nope.  There's more exercise of similar \\"wit,\\" including most tastelessly some completely shameless scenes in a Thai women's prison, where the filmmakers think the prisoners can be made to forget their cares and woes with a little Madonna sing-a-long and some lingerie.  Nice.    Save your money - do not buy this film.  At best, this movie should be seen by potential filmmakers and storytellers as a cautionary tale of the bad things that can happen to a great idea.
0765350386|5.0|Just finished this book and I went right to the sale barn and picked up two horses to pull my bandwagon to the local book stores and pick up idle fantasy readers. This book and Brandon are the real deal. This is not Fiest or Jordan this is a new player in fantasy. Now I know that Sanderson is finishing the Wheel of Time series and while reading this book I tried to compare his and Jordan's writing styles and I believe that Robert Jordan's wife choose the right author to finish the Wheel of Time.<br /><br />Mistborn is just as detailed and all encompassing as WOT. Actually I feel like Sanderson being younger than Jordan has taken a hold of the reigns for Epic Fantasy. He seems to have done what all great writers do, he has read and learned from his peers and created something new to add to the pyramid of Fantasy Novels. Nothing about this book is rehashed old Lord of the Rings or WOT material. Brandon has created a fresh world based on a magic system that is unique to the genre.  Metal is the basis to the magic in The Final Empire and the depth of how it relates and works within the world of this novel is perfect for us closet MENSA members (Ha!,yeah I wish)<br /><br />I hear this author is planning a 10 book series based on a new world unrelated to Mistborn......Guess I will need a bigger wagon, Huh ?

B002T9H2L0|4.0|First off, let's get this out of the way: Quentin Tarentino will never, EVER top \\"Pulp Fiction\\". Period. Not gonna happen. So everyone really needs to stop comparing his movies to \\"Pulp Fiction\\". Second, this isn't supposed to be an accurate, dramatic depiction of World War II. We've seen a million of those types of films, and no portrayal of the Holocaust is going to surpass \\"Schindler's List\\", nor should it: it's one of the best movies of all time. Now that we've gotten that out of the way, \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" isn't perfect but it's still a good movie. Christoph Waltz is to this movie what Javier Bardeim was to \\"No Country for Old Men\\": a menacing, sadistic lunatic who you wanted to die but at the same time didn't because he's such an interesting character. Hopefully Mr. Waltz will get more roles in major American films, because his portrayal of \\"the Jew Hunter\\" is amazing. Brad Pitt is extremely entertaining as the leader of the Basterds, Aldo Raine, and his \\"artwork\\" and the \\"debt\\" he extracts from his men are so horrible that you have to love it. He also does a wonderful East Tennessee accent that other actors could stand to learn from (I'm looking at you, George Clooney). However, Melanie Laurent steals the movie as Shosanna, the secretly-Jewish Parisian cinema owner determined to not only take out \\"the Jew Hunter\\" for murdering her family but also the entire Nazi regime during the premiere of a Nazi propaganda film. She's cold yet vulnerable and sweet yet ruthless, and she's clearly the center of attention in the scenes she's in.  Unfortunately, Tarantino's obsession with dialogue prevents this movie from taking the step from good to great. Despite the title, there are precious few appearances by the Basterds; they're pretty much confined to the end of the first chapter and portions of the last chapter (and then many only make cameo appearances). Eli Roth as Donnie Donowitz (\\"The Bear Jew\\" as he is know to the superstitious and scared Nazis) is a particular lost opportunity, because aside from Pitt's character he's the most interesting of the Basterds as well as the most sadistic (in a good way: we're talking about killing Nazis, after all). Diane Kruger's portrayal of double-agent Bridget von Hammerstock isn't terrible, but her character is so underexposed and boring that there's no real reason for her existence in the film. In fact, the entire episode in the bar is so unnecessary, drawn-out, and straight boring that you have to wonder what Tarantino was thinking shooting this scene at all; he could've used that time to undergo more exposition for the Basterds (or at least cut down on the length of the movie). This exact same criticism applies to the British agent and the scene with Churchill. I personally would've liked to have seen Shoshanna's biracial romance brought out a little more, and the entire high command of Germany meeting in a movie theater does seem a little far-fetched even for this movie (although the end result is wonderful).  Overall, I would say take this movie for what it is: a fun, incredibly violent (seriously, don't see this if you're sqeemish) ride. The ending is bittersweet, but anyone who hates the Nazis will still wish this is what had happened in real life (preferably in 1933). Now, some people (at least among critics) are upset because they think the all-Jewish Basterds are so horrifically violent that they are no better than the Gestapo. My response to this is who cares?! The Nazis - specifically the high command and the SS - commit so many atrocities that it really doesn't matter how violent the Basterds respond in kind: they can never be worse than the Nazis they terrorize. Definitely see this movie.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|It takes a few listenings to really understand where this concept is going.  Steve Wilson is brillaint and at times unveven.  PT is an outstanding band that has stayed under the US radar far too long.  \\"Time Flies\\" is a great song that almost could be a \\"radio hit\\" in its edited form.  The long form however, is a tribute to David Gilmore's playing on Animals.  One can imagine a young Steve playing that album over and over and inspiring him to become what he is today.  However the real genius here as with other PT albums, lies in Colin Edwards bass and the superb drumming.  Absolutely a masterpiece.  Don't ruin it by listening to it on your Ipod headphones.  Get a pair of Bose headphones and plug them into your amp, using a good CD player!  Best since Warszawa.

B002Q4U9YU|5.0|This CD is wonderful.  I'm a new Michael Jackson fan.  I'm older, so my kids listened to MJ, not me...until he died I can't say I was that familiar with all the songs he wrote and sang...but then he died, June 25th, 2009 and the TV was playing his music, videos, talk shows talked about him.  I liked what I  heard with his music.  I went out and bought his music, DVD's, books and listened to every shows giving MJ a tribute, a memorial, a talk show, whatever was on about Michael Jackson.      I never believe Michael Jackson was a child molester, even when I wasn't a fan.  I had always said he was just a man who never had any childhood and was now rich and famous and could afford to buy whatever he wanted, including exotic animals, carnival rides, trains, whatever he wanted....and he did...for himself and he was willing to share his toys with others, especially less fortunate kids, which he did with love.    This Is It, is the final collection of Michael Jackson's work.  The work he was preparing for his children, so that they could see what made him famous, why so many people were always trying to just touch him, see him, get as close as they could to him and his children.        Well, Michael Jackson came through with flying colors on this one.  The CD collection is primarily songs that he previously sang and his fans loved.  Michael Jackson wanted to give back to his fans who he loved very much.  His fans loved his music and showed it, they stood behind him always.  \\"This Is It\\" is done with love and the song is FANTASTIC...      The movie \\"This Is It\\" is even more wonderful and I'm waiting for that DVD to come.  I saw it at the movie theater and it was wonderful.  You got to see Michael Jackson, as himself.  Dedicated, talented, brilliant actually, a musical genius, a genius with dancing, choreography, anything and everything that was part of the creative entertainment process, Michael Jackson knew how to do it and did it with style and to perfection.      I definitely recommend this CD!    Michael Jackson was a very loving soul and the world is a better place because he lived here for his short 50 years.  Rest in peace Michael...Michael is upstairs, singing with the BIG Choir now...doing solo performances for the Divine....He is getting the answers to his Earth Song....\\"What about sunrise.  What about rain.  What about all the peace that you pledged your only son....he is getting his answers first hand.  As Michael Jackson said in his autobiography, \\"Moonwalk\\", \\"God gave him the talent to sing...I just opened my mouth\\".  Michael Jackson knew God and thanked him for his talents!  He even thanked him on stage when he received the awards for \\"We Are the World\\"...his first words were \\"I want to Thank God for letting me write this song with Lionel Richie\\"...    I feel thankful that I finally got to listen to Michael Jackson's music and appreciate all that he said in his songs.  He was also a great humanitarian...if there were only more people like Michael Jackson, this world would be a much better place.    Great music...highly recommend this collection \\"This Is It\\".
0199566186|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo18BOQJJERYLX8]]A LIFE IN THE LAW, RICHLY LIVED AND ENRICHING OTHERS!<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />This volume is a tribute to Lord Bingham, recognized internationally, as well as in the UK, as being one of the most influential judges of 20th century through his judicial and academic work during an historical period which has seen much turbulence, controversy and change.<br /><br />During his remarkable career Bingham held in succession the two most senior judicial offices in England and Wales: Master of the Rolls and Lord Chief Justice, followed by the highest judicial office in the United Kingdom, that of Senior Law Lord and an honour by Her Majesty with the Order of a Knighthood of the Garter. Through his scholarly writing he was influential, in the early 1990s, in arguing in favour of UK incorporation of the European Human Rights Convention and later for the creation of a UK Supreme Court.<br /><br />This book brings together more than 50 essays written either by colleagues who have known Bingham, or those who have been influenced by him, whether in academia or legal practice.  The result is truly diverting, revealing and enlightening, equally for the practitioner or indeed the general reader.  Certainly the `Biographical Sketch: The Early Years' section of the introduction - complete with photographs -- is a riveting read.<br /><br />Even as a schoolboy, Bingham revealed himself as an intellectual and academic prodigy, later to develop into a polymath with a formidable range of interests, ambitions and achievements.  The son of two doctors, one of them, his mother, an American who had grown up on a ranch in California, he displayed an array of talents which could have taken him successfully in almost any direction he might have wanted to go.<br /><br />As students of poetry, we were intrigued to learn, for example, of his early prowess in that sphere, winning an award at school for his poem `Since Sinai' which expresses the theme of God revealed through the beauty and power of nature.  Subsequently, despite the demands of his profession, he has always found time to write and to preside over a number of bodies, including the Hay Festival. It's one of the losses to modern public life that our senior judges are not called upon to make more public speeches as the clarity of Bingham's thought (and those of his colleagues) is a talent this country vastly under-uses: one day, when others read books like this, the position might change, and general communication of information improved from its current woeful state.<br /><br />Full of treasures of information and insight -- this book tells in 900 pages, from a number of detailed viewpoints, the story of a life richly lived, whose judicial and academic influence has enriched the life of nations worldwide.  In particular, you might be interested in the intriguingly worded Chapter 9 `What Decisions Should Judges Not Take?' by Jeffrey Jowell.  Above all, we were impressed with Nicholas Phillips' account of Lord Bingham's reputation for unfailing courtesy, especially to members of the Bar who came before him.  Would that all judges were like that and we use them more in public life!<br /><br />ISBN: 978-01- 995-66181ses the theme of God revealed through the beauty and power of nature.

1416594787|4.0|Ever since the Selfish Gene, Professor Dawkins has been educating readers not only on the details of evolution but on the sheer elegance of the natural world around us.  While reading the Selfish Gene I had a change in my viewpoint of the world that no other book has come close to.  Richard Dawkins latest book, The Greatest Show on Earth is a book describing the evidence for evolution.  He has spent so long discussing the fascinating repercussions of evolutionary theory on our scientific understanding of the world, that he has never written a book purely on the evidence for evolution.  It is unfortunate when a majority of the population doesn't believe in evolution that this book needs to be written.  But fear not, this book is not solely written to convert the uneducated masses.  As always, Richard uses clear prose and a variety of fascinating real-world examples to inspire awe and educate even those familiar with the subject.  Mr Darwin's theory is truly an elegant theory and our understanding of it has increased orders of magnitude since 'The Origin of Species' was first published.  Reading Richard's work always leaves me inspired and appreciative that I have been given a chance to understand the world around me.  This is what professor Dawkins does best and this book will fascinate and delight the reader.

B001EN71CW|5.0|I am one of the original browncoat fans - I watched this show live on Fox back when it was originally broadcast. I would tell all my friends to come over and watch it when it was on (not that it did us any good, it was still canceled in the end).<br /><br />This is character drama at its finest. By the end of the first episode, you will already love the characters. All the more amazing is that there are so many characters to know! But as the show goes on, you learn a little more about each of them. It's rare that you find a TV show that makes the people the center of the show, but this show pulls it off in spades.<br /><br />Did I mention that it's a show set in space, and sometimes they act a little bit like cowboys? Don't let that throw you off. For most movies or TV shows that are set in space, I'd say \\"If you're not a fan of this genre, this show/movie/whatever won't change your mind.\\" Well, in this case, don't worry about the space or cowboy theme - this show WILL change your mind. You will grow fond of the people and the ship they travel in, come to appreciate the worlds they travel through and the characters they meet, and be shocked by the choices they make.<br /><br />I as much as any original browncoat was crushed to see the show get canceled: imagine all the stories they could have told! We could have found out more about the blue-handed men, or what Shephard Book's past was, or what was up with Inara's vial - but we really never will. Instead, we got some of the best TV you'll ever see in a very imaginative world.<br /><br />I should point out that every one of my friends that I showed the show to ended up loving it. All of them, even my friends that \\"don't watch TV.\\"<br /><br />You will be quoting this show for a while: \\"Pain is scary.\\" \\"Shiny.\\" \\"You buy this ship, treat her proper, she'll be with you the rest of your life.\\"<br /><br />Trust me, it's worth it. Keep flying.
B002E01LL6|3.0|This is a good movie.  It starts off somewhat lame, but gets better towards the middle of the movie.  I am giving the movie 3 out 5 stars.  Any movie that stars Channing Tatum is worth watching just to see him.
1400063515|2.0|This book is extremely tedious and repetitious.  The central theme is that the Gaussian (Normal) probability law is an inadequate description of economic/financial outcomes.  Consequently most of modern economics and quantitative finance are junk science to the extent they are based on the false assumption above.  In addition, the book is mathematically dumbed down to the level of a sixth grader.  Thus it provides the reader very little insight beyond the obvious.  The author has precious little to offer beyond the simple fact stated above.    Great topic. Terrible execution. Don't waste your time with this worthless book.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Let me start with this...I have been a Star Trek fan since the 60's! I didn't think this movie would stand up against the original or the Next Generation films but, I was wrong! This is as good or better than the previous 10 movies! If your thinking, I don't like Star Trek, WATCH IT! It is a great action movie with a story. Only thing to me that was disappointing had nothing to do with the story but, the Blu-ray. It is sharp as I expected but not full screen, more of a letterbox like a regular wide screen DVD.  Oh well, I still would have bought movie anyway.
B0029O08WA|5.0|I really like this CD.  While I think the Twilight soundtrack is a bit better than this New Moon soundtrack, it's still definitely worth buying (especially for the price!).  I really don't think you can buy it for any cheaper than this.  When I first listened to this soundtrack, I was a bit dissappointed and thought some of the songs were REALLY weird (I think it's because I don't usually listen to this type of music).  However at the same time I couldn't STOP listening to it! Now I do so every day, twice a day, since I got it a month ago! It seems odd, but once you listen to it once or twice and warm up to it, you realize how great the CD is! I would list the \\"highlight\\" songs...but I then I would be listing 11 of the them...so I guess you could say it's a great CD and it is definitely worth giving it a try! Even if you aren't a Twilight fan, it's still great and can be enjoyed by the biggest Twi-hards or by the most extreme anti-twilighters!
B002HWRZH0|5.0|I'm not going to review the movie - you've all seen it, and although I liked it, I sure hope Paramount puts enough money into the next budget that they don't have to shoot parts of it in the Budwiser brewery and the LA Department of Water and Power - who would ever have though the original \\"Star Trek\\" engine room would look better than a multigazillion dollar movie.<br /><br />No, my review is simply of the replica Enterprise. It's beautiful. People are carping about the box and the certificate, etc, but trust me. If you had it in your hands, you'd love it and if you're a true Trekker, will kick yourself if you don't get it then see it later. It's a heavy, solid sculpture with a chrome base that's wonderful. Of course I would have liked to have paid less, but I'm glad I got it.<br /><br />Now if they could just do an original Klingon Warbird like this...
