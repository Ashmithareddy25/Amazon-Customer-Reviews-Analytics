B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really addicting and fun. I downloaded it today and I can't seem to quit playing. There should be more games out there like this one. My friend made me download this and I'm glad she did because I needed a fun game to play

0440246318|5.0|New York Times bestselling author, Lee Child, delivers another thrilling Masterpiece in the Jack Reacher series. A road trip turns into a three-ring circus as a conspiracy is brewing with lies, secrets, and distrust. A man was brutally murdered, while his relentless, psychotic killer is on the loose, or is there more than one killer? The FBI have no clues or leads in the investigation, and these dreadful horrifying events that pump up an adrenaline rush are only for starters. For the icing on the cake, Jack finds himself in boiling water once again, after attempting to hitch a ride, which turns out to be a real bad idea. After one woman drove him several miles, then dropped him off, who picked him up for his next ride? How long did he wait, before someone picked him up again, and who were the three people in the car? How did Jack explain his bloody, broken nose, and where was he heading? What was inside the woman's Bible? What did Jack discover about the two men and the woman in the car, and will justice be served as danger fills the air? Lee Child takes the reader on a thrilling roller-coaster ride through murder, intense-suspense, and unstoppable action. Along the way, the reader will witness surprising twists-and-turns. Will Jack find answers, before time runs out? The colorful characters come to life in a picture-perfect setting as this exciting, ingenious, suspenseful thriller entertains, until the final curtains close. I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. Jack Reacher is not just a hero, he's an unforgettable, extraordinary character, perfect for this addicting series. 'A WANTED MAN' is one of Lee Child's best in the Jack Reacher series, made for the big screen. I have been following his books for years, and have never been disappointed. As always, I look forward to his new releases. Dramatic, breathtaking, thrilling, and highly recommended!<br /><br />--Geraldine Ahearn(Author Geri Ahearn)
B0064MGU98|4.0|The premise is solid enough to sustain an ensemble drama series. And, for the most part, the cast is excellent.<br /><br />However, the handheld camera work and stark closeups are jarring in a way that detracts from the whole, giving the appearance of trying too hard to dramatize relatively ordinary scenes.
159448385X|5.0|I read many books in a year.  Some I read for entertainment and others<br />to increase my knowledge.  Then there is the rare book that does both of<br /> those things, plus touches your heart as well.  A Thousand Splendid<br />Suns by Khaled Hosseini does just that.  Hosseini's The Kite Runner was a<br /> magnificent book, and I enjoyed A Thousand Splendid Suns even more.<br /><br />Splendid<br /> Suns follows the lives of two Afghani women, Mariam and Laila, as they<br />move from children to adults.  The book spans 30 years, beginning with<br />the Soviet invasion and ending with the overthrow of the Taliban.  It's<br />difficult to explain more of the story without spoiling the plot, but<br />these two women go from being enemies to unlikely friends.  A Thousand<br />Suns is a moving story about the power of love, the bonds of friendship,<br /> the love of country, and the struggle to survive.  I hated to see it<br />end.<br /><br />I like books that teach me something, and there is a lot to<br />learn in Splendid Suns.  Previously, I didn't know much about the<br />political turmoil in Afghanistan and the various factions vying for<br />power.  I knew women had an appalling time living under the Taliban<br />regime, but I didn't realize how horrible conditions really were.  The<br />childbirth section will fill you with horror.  I also learned of the<br />natural beauty of Afghanistan and her fascinating history.<br /><br />I was<br />especially moved by Hesseini's eloquent writing and observations.  In<br />writing of friendship, \\"Boys, Laila came to see, treated friendship the<br />way they treated the sun: its existence undisputed; its radiance best<br />enjoyed, not beheld directly.\\"  There aren't too many writers who can<br />produce back-to-back masterpieces.  Khaled Hosseini is one of those rare<br /> talents who can pull off such a feat.

0307474275|5.0|Seldom in popular fiction do you find such intelligent writing as that<br />produced by Dan Brown.  In addition to the superbly crafted mystery that<br /> we are privileged to enjoy it is as though you have attended a seminar<br />on in this case art and religious iconology.<br />As Brown states at the<br />start of his book, \\"All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents<br /> and secret rituals in this novel are accurate. When I am reading a book<br /> by Dan Brown I never feel that I am wasting my time. You might ask if<br />all this information bogs down the story and the answer is a resounding<br />\\"NO\\".  Brown has the ability to take dry facts and present them in a<br />fascinating way.  He also brilliantly weaves together many diverse<br />threads into a coherent and intriguing plot.We first met Professor<br />Robert Langdon in Brown's previous thriller 'Angels And. Demons'. This<br />book continues our acquaintance with the compulsive and brilliant<br />Langdon and introduces the equally clever Sophie Neveu.  She is the<br />estranged granddaughter of the curator of the Louvre, who is the victim<br />of a savage murder. As he lays dying he leaves a cryptic message for his<br /> granddaughter and Langdon to decipher. Thrown together by the events<br />that have occurred they must combine their considerable skills to solve<br />the complex mystery before it is too late.This book is a must read for mystery buffs and anyone who enjoys intelligent literature!
B0054SMID0|4.0|It has a great cast and full of suspense. You don't really know where the plot goes. I highly recommend this movie.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|SPOILERS  -  Sylvia Day has created some interesting-ish characters and I was looking forward to reading about the end of the story in this book.  If she'd spent less time describing \\"glistening pre-cum\\" and more on the story, we'd know who put Nathan's bracelet on the dead Russian gangster, why Megumi had called in sick so many days in a row - and was not answering Eva's calls, whether Cary is Tatiana's baby-daddy - and whether she is going to carry to term,  and have some closure on Gideon's family, his history, Deanna, Anne Lucas, Corinne, and Eva's extended family.  We get none of that.  The book ends abruptly with multiple cliff-hangers, none of which are compelling enough to be more than annoying.  \\"Mommy porn\\" needs to be part of a meaningful storyline, not the reverse, with the story serving only to fill up space until another unnecessary, graphic, frankly - frequently gross description of Gideon filling up Eva's space.  (Yep, I meant to be crude there.  If you liked the book, you'll like that.  If not, join the crowd.)
B005LAIIKI|4.0|This may be a first step towards telling more of the real stories of bravery and unacceptance of slavery in America.  We know Amistad, but there are so many other stories waiting to be told.  The music, the shock value, even the proclaimed over-use of the &#34;word&#34; ;) were meant to draw folks to the theatre.  Once there, like or not, it kept your attention.  It was painful to watch, but I didn't move unitl it was over.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was so excited about this book coming out.  I wanted to like it but it just didn't do it for me.  I think this story could have been concluded in this book but we have to read 2 more books before we get the hopeful HEA.  I understood that there were 2 more books before reading this one, but I was hopeful that this one would the the HEA for Gideon and Eva and the next 2 would focus more on the other characters in the book.  This went on and on and it seemed to be fluffed with over the top sex.  I think it could have wrapped up nicely, but the author left so many unanswered questions and it just seemed to end mid conversation.  I had high hopes for this book since I have been waiting for months.  I think it was way overpriced and I felt cheated out of my money.  I hate to say that I will not be continuing with this series.  I returned the book.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I waited for a long time to see this, but didn't want to purchase DVD. I couldn't even finish this movie.
B0097HC8MK|5.0|Isn't true love when no matter what or who your love one is? This movie talks about it. Great performance of Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue. One of my favorite movies!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I waited and waited. The release date was pushed back, which I thought a publicity stunt for marketing. I reread the first two books (awesome) prior to Entwined with you, pre-ordered and was excited to see it delivered by 9p.m on 6/4. Trilogy means 3 so why is the author milking more money and dragging this nonsense? Here is my suggestion for the next title: finish with you Sylvia Day.<br /><br />Eva and Gideon story deserves a happy ending in book 3!!!!!
B000I3UMLQ|5.0|Yes, all the Trek films have good and bad, that ratio varies. Being a fan off all things Trek, I can't give any film less the max stars.

So don't go by my rating, see for yourself.<br /><br />To Bodly Go....
B006GWO5NE|5.0|just what i needed. I use it a lot and it was cheep thank you so very much. Great price
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I liked it...was waiting for the next instalment of course like everyone ...but I expected it to go further ....it did not cover nearly enough ground...and then brought up more issues ....and had no closure for anything from the previous book...it addressed it...sure...but no closure on anything...and too much on the peripheral characters in my opinion......in fact the ending was so abrupt that it took me a minute to realize it WAS the ending!<br /><br />...and now you have to wait goodness knows how long for the next book....what happened to a trilogy BTW???.....actually next two books to find their HEA....while I think her writing is good...and the story well written ....I wanted more closure and it sewed up by one more book maybe.....not two...a bit frustrating...and to be honest a bit of a cash grab to write five of them....this seemed like a thin volume...<br /><br />I think she will loose fans on this one .<br /><br />Would I recommend ...yes....but you may be disappointed !
B009IJJB8G|5.0|There are three takes on Doyle's &#34;Sherlock Holmes&#34; franchise in the media today: Robert Downey Jr.'s ongoing Warner Brothers &#34;traditional&#34; portrayal; Benedict Cumberbatch's updated portrayal with Martin Freeman as Watson on the BBC, and this one, Jonny Lee Miller with Lucy Liu as an interesting twist on the Watson side-kick. Each has it's own strengths and exploration of twists in the plot driven by the &#34;alternative universe&#34; of characters.<br /><br />Of the three, however, &#34;Elementary&#34; stands apart in the most distinct and exciting ways. It bends the &#34;Holmes&#34; saga in a truly new direction, not only substituting a woman for Watson, or America for England, but expanding the stories into new and thoroughly modern cases in a more &#34;realistic&#34; police environment. The role of Watson becomes more transparent; amazingly, because Liu as Watson comes from a completely different direction than the previous incarnations. The ancillary details that Doyle carefully skipped in his stories: dinner at Holmes home, the banter around the house, the more detailed interaction of Holmes and his &#34;companion&#34; becomes more central to the story, and explains much about the relationship that we've KNOWN was there before, but is openly displayed in &#34;Elementary&#34;. This alone would make the show outstanding as a &#34;companion&#34; to any of the other Holmes arcs...but combined with the ingenious plots and superb characterization, and adding in the &#34;dark&#34; side of Holmes that we glimpsed only once before (in the 1980's film &#34;The Seven Percent Solution&#34;), we have a richer tapestry of the character than ever before.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I read this book many years ago as a teenager and thought it was interesting.  But, rereading it as an older adult made a much bigger impression on me. The author is writing about how life was a century ago.  It was so specific of how people lived in those days.  How they coped with things and scraped for any bit of income was amazing.  I'm hoping I can find a biography of Betty Smith to see how she did get into writing and what the rest of her life was like.
B00464AVXW|5.0|Was a good movie just as I remember it and it was as good the second time around just trying the movie's for fun!!

B00AJLHU3K|5.0|I haven't paid much attention to Richard Thompson's music for the last twenty years so I bought this album to check out his new material.<br /><br />Great music, but really depressing lyrics. The first track is an upbeat rocker musically but the lyric is about an elderly man in lust with a younger woman. The woman isn't interested in his attention and old man ends up being beaten to a pulp and left bloodied and seriously injured on a sidewalk by two of the woman's young friends. Not exactly uplifting stuff.<br /><br />If the lyrics of some of these songs are autobiographical, it would appear Richard Thompson has gone through a marriage breakup recently; much of the album is devoted to songs about deteriorated relationships and marital breakups. Great music, but if you're inclined toward depression, this album is not going to help you see the bright side of life.<br /><br />On the upside, Richard Thompson is a great guitar player and that really comes through on this album. He also has an interesting singing voice and, although the lyrics of most songs on this album aren't exactly upbeat, Thompson's voice and guitar make them all worthwhile listening.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is really good album musically. Thompson's guitar prowess and vocal skills are front and center. But the lyrics......well, let's just say that if you're looking for something lyrically upbeat and happy, most of this CD isn't going to give you that.<br /><br />If you decide to buy this CD, make sure you get the \\"Deluxe\\" release that has two CDs in it rather than the single CD version. The material on the second CD in the 2CD release is worth having.
B000GOUMPI|5.0|As always it was a great movie this movie was watch by my grandson he is watching all the great old movies to keep him busy over the summer!!
B0052BZ6X8|4.0|I find most movies and TV programming are not enough to hold my attention so I am always doing something else while viewing. That did not happen in this case. I did actually pay attention to it. I generally like this genre of movies but the visual effects and characters of this movie were more engrossing than most.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so good! It's really addictive and the best thing is its free! I have never had any problems and its never crashed. The different themes each month are also a really good feature. I would definitely recommend that you get this game!:)
1907947655|1.0|Did not appear to be a facsimile of the original - which would have been appropriate for a bicentennial celebration of its publication. Boring cover, cheap paper and font - seemed like one of the quick-print books from scanned and OCR-ed text.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|wonderful app for any android device. simple and user friendly! I would recommend any avid reader to download this app and enjoy its perks. I don't need to travel with my kindle anymore, just my phone and charger after endless hours of reading.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|This is the kind of movie you have to see the end to understand the rest of the movie.<br />I am anxious to see it again to find out if it will be easier to follow.<br />Great acting by all the actors! This was a movie for them to show off their talents.<br />This is a movie that you have to put your thinking cap on and have a pot of coffee brewing nearby to stay alert.
044024367X|4.0|I enjoy reading Lee Child's novels. There is plenty of action and suspense. I love the main character's ideals on justice
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I am so disappointed with this book that I returned it for a refund. I bought this series as a trilogy with the belief that all of the character's stories would be wrapped up at the end of it. Instead I got new characters added in which I skipped over as they added nothing to the original story lines. I think they were filler, an afterthought to make sure that the book was stretched out for a hundred pages or more. So in my mind I will just add a happily ever after of my own for Gideon and Eva and save $20 more dollars.<br /><br />I have to add... the parts of the book revolving around the original characters was decent but there was not enough of it to keep the book from falling apart. It was choppy. It jumped around way too much between characters and there were characters that had a huge amount of space that had absolutely nothing to do with the previous two books. ALSO... there were quite a few that had no page-time at all. So I am very disappointed that such a good author would allow dollar signs to interfere with the quality of her writing. She could have written another series with Eva and Gideon as secondary characters like most authors do. Maybe Sylvia Day should have considered writing about Brett and including them a little but not this. What a let down.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The random ending of this book was the most transparent and greedy act I've ever encountered. If this book was remotely good I would be delighted to have the series continue.  This book was garbage, filler, silly story lines, throw in a missing secretary and out of left field the Russian Mob.... PLEASE!  Just because we read Young Adult/Erotic books doesn't mean we are complete idiots! The worst part of the entire thing was the vicious slap in the readers face by the author at the end of the book. I wanted to throw my iPad out of the moving car I was so angry.  I read it the first day it was released and was DELIGHTED to see how many other angry fans there were and that I wasn't alone in my rage.  I also discovered from those other readers that you could &#34;return for a refund&#34;. I immediately did so!  Sylvia Day will not get another dime from me...EVER.  Absolutely DONE WITH YOU!

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I am not sure why people are rating this book so low just because it is not going to be the last one!  I thought book ratings were supposed to rate the content of the book?! If you are unhappy that it it not the last book then DON'T BUY IT!  Don't bash the author. Just like with any employer we are asked to do things at our work that we don't necessarily agree with, but we do because we want to keep making money. With that said, I LOVED THE BOOK!  I finally felt like Gideon and Eva were working on their relationship in a positive way. Gideon was open with Eva about all of his secrets. They did not solve there arguments with sex and then never discuss the real issues. I believe that in this book they really grew as a couple. I look forward to reading the other two books! Don't you ever read a book and think I wish it would never end?! Well now we know it won't because we get two more books with Gideon and Eva! Yay!
0385349947|5.0|I loved how this book addressed women in the workforce. I am almost 50 and have seen such change in the workforce since I started working. It was great to read what Sheryl has observed and what her thoughts are on women working. Also, her suggestions on how to make it work are useful. The book also made me look at my career and how I am not &#34;Leaning In&#34; which is my choice and is okay. Many women might think Sheryl is crazy, you cannot do it all but there are many husbands willing to take a back seat for their wives to &#34;Lean In&#34; and it is an important topic to address today. Women don't have to have a more successful spouse where they are both working all the time and the kids are neglected. There are ways to make it work.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Easily the most fun runner game I've played, but I have to take one star away because while Amazon finally gave Kindle Fire owners the Miami update, it's been a week since the regular Android version was updated.  C'mon Amazon.. don't leave Kindle Fire owners envious of other Android device owners that get the updates earlier than we do.  Especially when this app updates locales every month.<br /><br />June 26th update.<br /><br />Upgraded my rating to 5 stars (4 previously).  The July update (Paris) came the same day as the Play store.  No delay this month.  Yeah!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book and it was def worth the wait!!  Is it time for book 4 and 5 yet?!
B002HR1W1K|5.0|I'm gonna cut to the chase here and say that this is by far the funniest british comedy I've ever seen. Watch the trailer on YouTube to get a sense of the plot but the two main actors work amazingly well together. Their characters provide you with stupid and witty humor and it keeps going and going. I've probably watched this movie more than any other movie I own just because the story line is easy to follow and it is so funny you can watch it in bits and still be satisfied. Give it a shot!

B003OCWF6I|5.0|If you want to know what the movie is about you'll have to watch the trailer on YouTube but I'll tell you that I found the movie very enjoyable. There is good action, plenty of comedy, and even a twist or two. It is a movie similar to A-team in the sense that it is about a team of elite soldiers that are on the path for revenge but the story is different enough that you dont ever feel like it is an A-Team rip-off. I own both A-Team and this one blu-ray and I love them both.

B002T9H2ME|5.0|Watch the trailer for it on YouTube to get you interested but keep in mind, it's not quite what you expect. The trailer does a good job of introducing the first part of the movie but the true plot is much larger than the trailer leads you to believe. The movie has a great soundtrack that really sets the mood. I dont want to give anything away but just watch the trailer and know that it only gets bigger from there. Give it a chance!

Sookie ended up right where she needed to be at the end of the story, no matter what happens with her love life, she's comfortable with herself and her home.<br /><br />It was also great to check in with a lot of the characters that have always rounded out Sookie's world so well :)
B007UXTQAU|5.0|There are no good guys when it comes to survival. This movie is a non stop suspense ride as hopefully survivor face challenges both outside and within. Judging from the men's facial hair, lack their of, the entire decent into madness takes less than 48 hours. If you are a fan of intense movies pick it up. This is in my personal top five.
030789701X|5.0|This strategy guide is, without a shadow of a doubt, the thickest, the heaviest and the most detailed strategy guide the world has ever seen.<br /><br />The original Skyrim guide was already massive with 656 pages of contents jam-packed with details on the papers only the scopes of games like Skyrim can fill.  However, the new Legendary Collector's Edition Prima Official Game Guide has, get this, whopping 1120 pages of contents expanded accordingly to the addition of the newly added contents from 3 Official Add-ons Dawnguard, Hearthfire and Dragonborn.<br /><br />The book was delivered for free in very speedy one day by USPS (pre-order special) in the usual Amazon cardboard box.<br /><br />Inside the box, this massive tome was thick, double shrink-wrapped with cardboard slightly bigger than the book itself, giving extra protection from any possible damage collectors would just scream from the top of their heads.<br /><br />The Collector's Edition Guide comes with a free code for access to the bonus eGuide, fully interactive online guide that would normally cost $26, at Prima Games website and nice exclusive 24\\" panoramic poster showing the entirety of Alduin's Wall and signatures from the members of Bethesda Game Studios.<br /><br />It also has hardcover bound and ribbon bookmarks to give you extra quality.<br /><br />Otherwise the regular edition and the collector's edition are identical in the number of pages and contents, and both comes with a two-sided map of Skyrim.<br /><br />While the quality of the paper used for the original guide was excellent, the quality of the new Legendary Edition Guide is slightly different, has even more glossy and smoother feel, more like Fallout 3 GotY Collector's Edition Guide than how the original collector's edition guide was.<br /><br />The quality of the hardbound covers is on par with the original collector's edition guide, thick and smooth, but I think the book could have used even thicker cover since the book has over 450 extra pages from the original guide.<br /><br />The style, layouts and the contents are identical from the original guide but with the newly added contents from 3 add-ons.<br /><br />The book also has index at the end of the book so you can easily find contents.<br /><br />Not only would Dovahkiin level up all his vital skills at 100 if he acquires this ridiculously massive tome, but he might do just fine if he uses this as shield or even heavy weapon.<br /><br />Some might complain about the steep price tag of $50 ($32 and change at Amazon), but you'll be hard-pressed to find a hardbound book with over 1100 pages of glossy papers that would cost any less, so if you are a huge fan of Skyrim, this book is a nice memorabilia for you to sit back, relax with and reminisce of the journey you have embarked on in the land of Skyrim.

Maybe it helped me connect the dots between players and remember names better, but story wise season one on TV has got it right. I'm not speaking for the rest of the book series, but for me reading this first book was redundant, and towards the end even boring. Still, an ok book on its own.
0345529057|4.0|You will love it if you love:<br />-drawn out intricate plots<br />-the t.v. show and want more background<br />-don't need too much plot resolution in one book<br /><br />You may like it or perhaps enjoy it less (may slightly dislike) than some if:<br />-you're an avid reader of dark fantasy (M. Moorcock)<br />-you prefer shorter stories with a few core characters<br />-you don't like drawn out stories<br /><br />That being said, I really enjoy the t.v. show and the extra depth within the books, but it does feel very drawn out.
1416575464|5.0|People always refer to this book as a &#34;decorating bible&#34; and for good reason. If you're on the fence, just buy it
B00CS65JS2|3.0|Get lucky is a great catchy song...but was disappointed in the album for the most part...bought into the hype..unfortunately...In my opinion this is a typical draft punk release.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|This book was a great read. The story was intense and exciting to read. The symbolism and encoding of structures, engravings, paintings, and religious writings were very thought provoking.  Whether the symbolism is fact or not the book gives you a sense of hope that mankind can live in unity and achieve great things
030759565X|5.0|I have enjoyed this book..great recipes that are reminiscent of a file of good ones from family and friends.  Blueberry Cornmeal cake is worth the price of the book..Have not cooked anything from this book that we didn't like.  Recently have given to brides as a gift.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|I have been a fan of scary movies for 35 years now.  This movie has it all and a surprise ending that will get you thinking about a possible sequel.  Highly recommend with all the lights turned off!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is cool, my son and I play it.......and he is 3 years old :). We like the jumping from train to train
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I don't care if people think that this book isn't that great because there's no real action but there is and I cried 5 time reading this book.
B0060MYKTY|5.0|Great entertainment, excellent writing, superior acting by the entire cast (great casting) this is truly one to buy because you will want to watch again and again until the next season is released. Truly worth watching!
B000000OSE|5.0|More or less as good as volume 2. Volume 1 contains much more straight up rocks than 2 does, but that's probably a coincidence, not a plan. I enjoy both albums but enjoy them the most when taken together.
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|I enjoy listening to all of these CDs, they are all unique in their own ways and I really appreciate how Tyler puts his effort into creating things the way he wants them, not being a generic artist. He does what he enjoys and puts in a lot of effort into his work from CDs to Socks, always something different and exciting.
B00029LNHS|5.0|This is the last album from BEP where they feel like they aren't reveling in their uber-fame. The songs are fun and don't feel pretentious like their following albums.
B004ELSDZK|5.0|The gameplay gets more challenging as you go and promotes thinking ahead to release the spirits.  The short sequences between play are fun and light-hearted and add to the game's charm.
B000002GYR|5.0|When you think about the types of music popular in the 70s, it's hard to believe something like Closing Time even came out within 20 years of it. Among other things, here is a man in his early 20s singing a love song from the perspective of a man half a century older and it's 100% believable. I can't speak highly enough about this album.
B00ATPVA78|5.0|BEAUTIFUL SCIENCES. EXCITING YET RELAX. GREAT STORY.  LOTS OF FUN . IT DESERVES FIVE STARS  OR MORE. I.M STILL PLAYING  CAN&acute;T STOP NOW. VERY ADDICTIVE.
B002N5N4M6|4.0|By season 3 the decent has begun from quirky geeky show to every other relationship sitcom. It's still funny but it's missing something that the 1st 2 seasons had.
B0077ZNCE2|5.0|I'm hoping they will continue the Twilight Saga.This is one of the best romances I have ever seen.. I wait each time, waiting for a new one to come out.,
B0002UMCNQ|5.0|I can't think of anything negative to say about this movie. This is what Pixar looks like at its best. The voice acting, story, and imaginative world are captivating.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Amazing story of a true American Patriot!  Truly inspirational book about a Navy SEAL who overcame tremendous obstacles to become a top warrior as well as a wonderful husband and father.
B003C34CZG|3.0|I think MCR got better with every album. The unfortunate flip side to this is that the albums get worse as you go back in time. This isn't a bad album but I listen to it far less often than their other ones. One caveat is that I typically like MCR albums more as I listen to them more so maybe that will happen here too.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This is the cheapest part I ordered and I like it  a lot  more than all the other electronic Items on Amazon that I've order
630518299X|5.0|This movie feels dated but it has something that few other movies can provide: a reference point. When you find yourself saying &#34;this feels like Groundhog Day&#34; or &#34;this is like the Truman Show&#34; -- it's become something special.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars but the ending was like walking along then the sidewalk ends, it did not make sense to end it there.  I am excited for another book as I like these characters.  The rest of the book was great, a lot going on, questions answered, would definitely recommend it to anyone.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|Despite the predictable ending, the rest of the movie is wonderfully compelling. Good actors, great set, and a surprisingly captivating relationship between the 2 main characters keep me coming back to this movie.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Stayed up till 4 to finish this book and the \\"trilogy\\" with the hopefully happy ending I wanted. Instead I was greeted with a coy authors note mocking me with another sequel. The book was actually my favorite of the 3, but got a little overwhelming toward the end setting up to many character lines and plot twists for the next two books. I would have been perfectly fine without all the Corinne nonsense, a bracelet explanation, and a frikkin wedding. Guess Sylvia has to get another $20 out of me before she is satisfied.<br /><br />Like I said though this was my favorite out of the three. The relationship reached a new level that it was about damn time they got to. It was more comfortable and confident and I enjoyed reading how they dealt with issues instead of blowing up and then mauling each other. The whole book wasnt just them falling apart over and over, it was them enduring despite the world.<br /><br />Seriously though Eva being attracted to Brett again after Gideon killed for her? That is one thing that didnt sit right with me. And frikkin leave Megumi alone. You have enough going on already.<br /><br />And by the way Sylvia \\"uhhh\\" is the sound of confusion not sexual arousal.
6302769051|5.0|When I first saw Unforgiven, it felt to westerns as Pulp Fiction feels to crime films: I've been in this world before, but never like this. Add to it these phenomenal actors and you've got one very compelling movie.
B0090KZDSK|1.0|I don't even understand the ending. What happened? I feel so ripped off. Is there another book? So we are going to have to wait months again and pay more money. This book was such a let down doesn't even compare... What happened Sylvia????
B000KCHZK6|4.0|This is a good solid album. It doesn't quite live up to the 2 prior so I can't give it 5 stars but still a nice work.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I only choose this band since their name has Dragons in it. I am thankful<br />as now I cannot get this off my CD player. Hit after hit. I played it for<br />my teenage daughter who recognized many of the opening licks of the<br />songs. Rockin&#34;, great lyrics and the band is special. Get this tape NOW<br />for the summer.
B00005JKMQ|5.0|Although much longer than it needs to be, Will Smith delivers a stunning performance. This was the first movie where I saw him play someone other than himself and he did it quite well.
B0095P33IW|4.0|Liked the story.<br />Action packed.<br />Fun to be watching while waiting for a fare.<br />Have seen it multiple times in the theater.
B000001FFJ|5.0|It's hard to believe music as quirky as Tom Waits makes could possibly be as accessible as on Rain Dogs. It's a top notch album from start to finish.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love having this on my phone.  I use it all the time.  I never mind waiting for things like oil changes or prescriptions to be filled, etc.  I just open my Kindle and read!  I don't even notice the time.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A very good read although a little close to home for me. Many can learn from this story and grow into freedom from an abusive situation.
B008JJM88Q|3.0|It's pretty obvious to me how this works.  It's based on the old ANIMAL game, which had the distinction of being one of the first computer viruses, though it had no malicious intent.  See [...] for some coverage of this.<br /><br />  In this modern form, instead of replicating as a virus to spread its updating database; obviously depends on a central server.<br /><br />  The principle is simple, actually.  It asks a series of yes/no questions, which eventually lead to a character that fits the answers.  I've not yet seen it fail to guess a character, but I know what will happen when it does; it would ask the user to identify the character,and a question which distinguishes that character from the one that it incorrectly guessed.  This would be added to the central database, so that next time someone plays that character, the new question will enable it to correctly guess it.<br /><br />  The original ANIMAL game might have started out only knowing a cat.  You'd run it, and it would ask, \\"Are you thinking of a cat?\\"  If you replied that it was not, it'd ask you what animal you were thinking of.  You could then reply that it was a dog, whereupon the program would ask you to provide a question that distinguishes a dog from a cat.  You could then supply the question \\"Does it bark?\\", and that a \\"yes\\" answer indicates a dog.  ANIMAL would then save that information, and the next time it was run, it would ask, \\"Does it bark?\\"?  If you reply \\"Yes\\", then it would guess that you are thinking of a dog, otherwise, it would guess that you are thinking of a cat.  If you were thinking of neither a dog nor a cat, then again, it would ask you what you were thinking of, and to provide a question to distinguish the new animal from what it incorrectly guessed, and it would save that.  As the game is played repeatedly with new animals, the database grows, and ANIMAL learns an increasingly complex tree of questions to allow it to guess an increasingly-large number of different animals.<br /><br />  I believe this is how Akinator works.  It probably started out with one character that it knew, and the database grows each time it fails to guess a character, and is provided with the question tree that leads to each new character.w Akinator works.  It probably started out with one character that it knew, and the database grows each time it fails to guess a character, and is provided with the question tree that leads to each new character.
B004X6PRO6|1.0|I could not relate to the character.  The story was unappealing.  I didn't finish it and would not recommend it.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|This headset is a pretty good one overall. The mic is very good, the sound is very good, and I was pleased with it for the most part. However, the left ear snapped off recently and it's been less than a year since I ordered it. It's somewhat disappointing because my last Turtle Beach headset lasted much longer.<br /><br />I would recommend this headset, but be careful with it. Treat it very carefully or it may break earlier than intended.
B000AO4NJA|4.0|I play the CD while on longer trips and find it good listening and passes the time for me.  Thanks
0756655307|5.0|I got the book in excellent condition. The book is as usual, great, and it was a gift, so the person who received it was very very happy.
B00CL50KDY|5.0|It had just a small bit of good humor.  Not over done.  Acting was good.  It was not too gross. story line was good.  Sundays are dinner / movie night with my grown children and girl friends, we all enjoyed it.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|This movie really gives you something to think about. I can't wait until the second movie comes out.... Nov. 11th.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|I had read this book a long time ago and many times since then. The movie does not follow the book in its entirety but like LOTR, it does have a good storyline and some stunning graphics.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|The game is very addicting.  It can be frustrating also but that is because I am not quick enough sometimes. :)  Worth the money for the amount of entertainment gained!
B001XULSG6|5.0|If you liked TNG then this movie is the one for you. The BORG were always my favorite in that series.
B00992CF6W|2.0|this sucks you cant fly over stuff you dont have the nether and they havent even updated it :/ boo
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Having visually powerful scenes, with the music and acting, create an incredible environment in which to watch this timeless classic.  It actually adds some plot details in the book that had been left out of the Broadway musical.
0425263991|5.0|Kaleb Krychek, throughout this series has been an enigma wrapped in mystery shrouded by obfuscation.  In Heart of Obsidian we get to peel back some of the layers of this powerful double cardinal.  We have seen him ruthless, focused, and on occasion kind.  Now we get to see where he came from and how he got to be the youngest ever member of the now defunct Psy council.  Kaleb has secrets on top of secrets and we get to learn some of them including the biggest of them all.<br />This is an incredible addition to the Psy-Changeling series.  A series I must admit that I love and re-read regularly.  I look forward to future visits to the fascinating world of Ms. Singh's Psy-Changelings.
B00AG297GK|1.0|I like to watch silly movies to take my mind off the stressful day but this movie was so bad I couldn't even finish watching it.
B00A7W29BE|1.0|I did not like the quality of scans - blurry and distorted. I tried many times to get a clean pic/scan and could not.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Once again, I am enchanted and enthralled with this authors works.  This is a story that touches each crevice of your soul, you actually feel the hurt, love and betrayal that these characters endure.  I waited so long for this book and it was well worth the wait.  I just hope there is not such a wait for his next novel!
B00C5GZKVQ|4.0|This is a very fun game to play. You can control it with buttons or gyroscope. Definitely a good game - a keeper.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|I'm in my mid 60s and was desperately trying to finish college, working way way too many hours when the Eagles arrived on the scene.  My life-long love of music was absolutely interrupted for 2-3 years there,  In the 60s I worked as a disk jockey, listening to music 40-50 hours a week, every week.  Then nothing.<br /><br /> When I discovered the Eagles and some other early 70s bands in about 1975,  I liked them a lot.  I've not gone to many concerts because when I have I've been disappointed with my seats.  I've never felt like I could see the band very well.  When the Eagles reunited for the Hell Freezes Over concert, my high school aged daughter got her hands on a couple of tickets that she (generously) asked if her mother and I wanted.  We were luke warm. Certainly the price was right, but was it worth it to sit behind a post and listen to the concert?  Then we noticed that the tickets were ROW 1.  We went.  Perhaps one of the best evenings of my life!!!<br /><br />We weren't 12 feet from Don Felder and Joe Walsh.  Watching Felder play the opening licks of Hotel California is hard to put into words. I was awestruck.  I've read a lot about the band since and have built quite an Eagles collection, and their music has a lot of space on my HOT 100 (favorite) playlist.  I had heard about this documentary and was anxious to get it.  And anxious to watch it.<br /><br />It wasn't easy.  The first three mailings of it from Amazon were defective.  And the fourth one, though it plays, only seems to play when it wants to.  I have been able to watch it, but it wasn't easy.  It is a great great story though and though I got so I wasn't sure I wanted to keep playing the return games, it was worth it.<br /><br /> All four remaining members are such incredible talents that I could go on and on talking about them.  I had always assumed that both Frey and Henley were equal leaders.  But, from watching this, my sense is that Frey is the heart of the band.  And the three men who camebefore them were equally great.  I understand Felder can't sing and I understand that he and Frey were a little oil and water, but it is too bad that Frey wasn't able to be more adult and allow the composer of the band's greatest song to stay aboard.  At the same time, I see Felder's prickishness.  Grow up guys.  But, I wasn't there, so who am I to judge, even this much.<br /><br />  For anybody who has more than a passing interest in the Eagles....this is four hours of great great entertainment.  I'd only suggest that you invest in counseling for your DVD player before you order.  Maybe, with that, you'll not have to invest a month of returning faulty dvds and a good 20 hours TRYING to get the bastards to play.  Good luck.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Really helps me quiet my mind and get to sleep as I have a hard time turning off my brain at night. This is the main reason I purchased this app and it does work.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great page turner! Gillian Flynn keeps the plot twisting and turning.<br />A varried cast of characters that keep you guessing as to their motives.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I got this thinking it would just be an okay movie, but I really enjoyed it.  If you're looking for a good summery chick flick then watch this!
0425263991|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book, and think it is one of the best in the Psy/Changeling series. So many puzzles are finally explained, and we finally find out who the Ghost is. I didn't think that I would like Kaleb as a lead character, he always seemed so on the verge of becoming evil, but now... I adore him. And the leading lady was the perfect match for Kaleb, strong and compassionate. This is a beautiful love story, and I think everyone should have a love like this. I don't want to give away too much spoilers, so I won't comment in detail on the book. If you love Nalini Singh's books, you HAVE to read this book. You won't be disappointed.
B002KSPKRS|1.0|I have to say this was a BIG disappointment. From the first 5 mins it was great but then the popping crackle and well it just shuts off. Nothing like haveing your head phones  shut off in the middle of a hardcore team death match on COD. I just recieved these yesturday and ill be buying a different pair after work today.. My x12 headset ownes these ones.... JUNK all I can say........... DO NOT BUY THIS P.O.S. HEAD SET
B003ODIZL6|3.0|This book has great experience in every day life. People can learn new vocabulary also people can look into this dictionary and see what they can relate to.
B00710Z87M|5.0|Just finished this book today...have been implementing all of the meditations and practices for manifesting.  This really could be called create anything you want... Truth be told that which I am manifesting practically is still in progress... In any case, being as positive, fantastical and idealistic as I've always wanted to be is just plain fun!  My favorite part of this book is it gives you full permission to be as dreamy as you want.  Your imagination has no limits and that is so liberating.  I finally gave myself to permission to dream my biggest dreams, ask for things I only could meagerly hope for before.  They say when you shake the universe's apple tree you're likely to get oranges- but those oranges will be sweeter than all the apples you could have hoped for.  Time will tell, but I sure am a happy camper in the meantime!
B009VIZDLI|3.0|A relaxing, pleasurable, light read. An insight into another's thought processes.  I would recommend this to others. Go, go Rosie

B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|Just bad acting with a so so story and a poor director. The special effects ranged from okay to cheesy.
B0002KPIQY|5.0|angie dicked down that one chick and it was hot then got they into the shower to together long story short great move only because Angelina Jolie has sex with a woman and she was still beautiful at the time before all her plastic surgery s***.
B00AQM8H9I|3.0|A simple yet frusteratingly difficult game of collectig the most fish. I was delighted by how no matter my strategy i could not be sure of victory. It was fun to pass the time, would have been great on my cellphone instead of my kindle.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I came upon this series on Showtime.  I've watched every episode.  I just HAD to have the DVD and have already preordered the 2nd season.  Great !!!!
B003JUGQ38|4.0|I love David Tennant as &#34;The Doctor&#34;.  It was a good season and I look forward to catching up with the rest of the episodes.
B005S9ELY4|5.0|This movie was even better than I expected.  It had a good cast and story. Some violence but otherwise very entertaining.
B00003CX5P|5.0|The DVD was in the best shape and now I have the full collection and can spend the day with Star wars.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I love the character development.  It gets better from season to season. I love the tension between the characters and am really excited about the possibility of a new firm being part of the series.
B00AG297GK|2.0|Just watched it because it was on prime instant video. It should have been more documentary in style. I know it would have been confused with Borat perhaps, but they went about it the wrong way it seemed. Worth a watch so you can say you saw it, I suppose.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|was a good watch. The video played perfectly from amazon. if you don't watch this, mama will be mad. very mad
0375869026|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read! Children and adults alike could benefit from reading about a misfit child who just wants to fit in. It'll be great for students who struggle because they'll be able to see that everyone can overcome challenges, and it's also great for high achieving students because they will learn more about empathy. Awesome book!
B001EN71CW|5.0|I have no idea why this show didn't make it.. It has it all.  Great writing, fantastic storyline, amazing ancting, and loveable characters.  There will never be and has never been a show quite like this one.  Oh and the blu ray quality is pretty awesome.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I had a blast playing this game. It only really took me a week or so to complete, but it was a lot of fun getting through it and you can keep playing, even after you have completed the game. Getting the upgrades were satisfying and I was always looking forward to what the next material or type would be. All in all, a great game for a free app, and an app that I would be willing to actually pay for.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Just like my firefly review, i loved this...  This cast was so electric..  You cant stop watching it.  5 stars definitely.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|awesome movie...seen the second part in the theatre and then ive watched the first one cause i liked it so much and both of them were really really good
0307950689|5.0|I have read all of Dan Browns Book and this one was awesome.  I finished the whole thing in one Sunday.  I just couldn't peel myself away from this book.  I was so caught up in it.

B000WQWPKA|5.0|This movie is a classic and the only thing better than this movie...  Is this movie in blu ray.  Awesome.
B005HJWWW8|2.0|Not impressed. Actually sounds better with out the amp. Unless you are looking to add bass or listen to distortion, save your money
B00338QENI|4.0|I had never heard of Henrietta Lacks before reading this book, but it was a wonderful examination of all that went on after her death. Her cancer cells were kept alive and used for generations, right up until the present day. Unfortunately, her family was not consulted or paid, and their story is important here.
B002RI97IY|5.0|A book that gives an insight into our true being to bring about a transformation in the way we lead our lives.
B000VNMMQG|4.0|OUR EXPECTATIONS WERE TO LEARN ABOUT THE CAPTAIN'S REDEMTION(S).  SETTING THE STAGE FOR ARROGANCE IN ACTION BY PARLIMENT, DURING THAT TIME PERIOD THROUGH TODAY, IS WELL UNDERSTOOD. ANY AMERICAN FAMILY WITH ROOTS IN EUROPE KNOW WHY THE COLONISTS ESCAPED THAT FORM OF TYRANY. THAT SAID, WHAT AMAZING COURAGE OUR HERO DISPLAYED DURING HIS VOCATIONAL PURSUIT.<br /><br />I WONDER WHAT KIND OF ANALOGIES CAN BE DRAWN TODAY WITH THE NEW DEMOCRACY. I BELIEVE THAT PRIMARY & SECONDARY,  EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS SHOULD ADD MORE EMPHASIS ON REALITIES.  HISTORY CAN BE REPEATED WHEN GOD GIVEN COMPASSION IS SCORNED AND MATERIALISM BECOMES THE IDOL.
B000I3P3EM|4.0|After the dissappointment of &#34;Final Frontier&#34; , This was a nice comeback to real tradition of Star Trek!  Great story, action with all the cliff hangers.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|Freakin' Quentin Tarantino has gotta be the sickest of dude out there.  He stands out, even in the sickness of Hollywood as a vacuous, purveyor of the most disgusting crap  I have ever seen.  The story sucks (there is no story), the blood spatter sucks.  There are no socially redeeming qualities in this movie whatsoever.  As a matter of fact, there will probably white people who will be killed because of the racist anger that will be stoked by this movie.  In a just world, Tarantino would be tortured, put to death in a slow, tormenting way, and then burn in hell for all eternity as an accomplice to inciting murder and mahem.  The funny part, if you consider sickness funny, is that the movie actually was boring.  If you want to more of this kind of entertainment, go and gouge out some cute puppy's eyes.  If you really enjoyed this movie, you are a sicko too!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This will make you laugh and, if you're on a date, it might make a perfect date movie.  My 12-yr old loved it and it made my wife cry.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|This movie was an epic from beginning to end. Daniel day lewis does an amazing job portraying such a character. The whole movie itself is such a pleasure to watch. The director does an impressive job managing to put all of this together! I was thorughly pleased!
B008PZ69T8|5.0|Well, if you haven't read  ALL of the Shades yet, shame!  When you do, you'll want to sit back, listen to this sweet music, think of your own &#34;room,&#34; and sip on a glass of wine.  It does put you in the mood.
1577314808|5.0|This book was an excellent eye opener! From beginning to end it made soo much sense and has just made in indelible impression on me. Would recommend this book to literally ayone who's an avid reader!
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This great movie is a mixture of old and new.  I love the real scenes of Paris and the crossover between times.  The acting is real good, too.
1878424114|5.0|Loved everything about it. Would recommend this to anyone despite whatever is going on in your life. I'm sure this would be able to assist you in some way. The author has such a profound way of wording his thoughts. Excellent book!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Had fun! Just difficult enough to be challenging but not so to be discouraging. Of course... can't wait for more! Graphics aren't cheaply done and the hidden objects are not repetative ... like some others I have played. Thanks!
B003E2UQMS|5.0|Saw the movie & then read the book... Loved movie but the book was even better!!! Definitely worth a reas
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Most women my age would be glad to have a Kindle Fire to read books on, but I really prefer &#34;going for a run&#34; on Temple Run 2.  I guess I haven't found the type of books that I really enjoy yet.  Maybe I'll have to find magazines instead LOL.<br />Temple Run 2 is difficult and just when I started getting good, the &#34;run&#34; changed.  That will keep me going trying to beat my own score and gain one position higher in the top ten! I actually hate being chased.  This game allows me to face that fear head-on.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|I have to say I have tried a lot of apps only day but this is has to be among the top worst I have tried!
1451695195|5.0|I've read many books over the many years of my life; many were very good; Eben Alexander being a Neurosurgeon and an authority on the brain gives a doctors expert testimony of the Reality of these experiences.  I, myself had one of these NDE's when I was the age of 36.  I was afraid to share it with anyone for many years because I felt people would judge me crazy.  I testify these experiences are very real.  My Grandfather died when I was 7 years old yet when I stood looking at my body laying face down in the snow on the road, I did not understand what was happening until my Grandpa put his hand on my shoulder and welcomed me.  Eben Alexander's book reinforced the experience which I had.
0061438294|5.0|This book is very well written and easy to understand.  Knowing how to read people and what their body is saying during an interview helps when hiring and filling positions within your company.  I would recommend this book to anyone doing the interviews. The book by far exceeded my expectations.
1439170045|5.0|This is an incredible look into the mind of the person WITH the disease and how the family handled the events...by the end of the book, I dearly loved Alice, and her family. Thankfully, it did not carry the subject to the long and bitter ends of the illness, but it continued with Alice's thoughts through the end of the story...Good thought provoking study questions at the end of the book.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Good thing this was the last in the series; not much happening anymore and seemed to kind of limp home for me.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great book. It is filled with so much and so easy to be  lost in. I never wanted to put it down.
1594204217|3.0|I think Pollan wanders around a bit in getting to the meat of the subject, I like the information when he final get to it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it but you should make it better because it is a boarding game now so get it better. I did love it but you need to change it so more the game should go to Ohio and all the other states.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I will never forget this book! I don`t know how Suzanne Collins came up with it! It was surprising, sad, terrifying, and even some parts that simply made you want to smile. I would recommend this book to anyone ages 9 and up(there are some intense parts).  Once you start reading this, you can`t stop! Seriously, I read the entire series in two weeks! I believe this is the best book of the three in the series. Enjoy!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This children story is very enchanting and  will surely warm your heart. A true classic for every generation. I loved every page.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|The acting is better than in previous shows and movies.  The whole movie went all out to make it great entertainment.  Story, acting, humor, adventure, graphics, romance, fighting, good guys win again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Totally worth the money my parents spent!!!!! If you don't like minecraft, it's hard to believe, but I used to hate it! I tried it on my friends ipod, and ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! I recommend this for everyone  to try. Even the buttfaces who hate it!!!!!!
B009JZWWGC|5.0|Star Trek movies and series are great entertainment.  Great concept for social structure.  Love the adventure and good guys always win.
1480054542|5.0|This is my favorite book in the Pride Series, by Jill Sanders. Ms. Sanders does such a good job of portraying the characters and setting, that I want to drive four days to Oregon and visit. I want to stay at the Pride B and B, eat at the Golden Oar, and hit on Iian, just to say I did it. See? These are real people to me, and that's awesome-sauce. Kudos!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely loved it!  My only issue is with the video player.  Many times it would say that the video was loading and it would never load!  Also it would pause in the middle of the video many times and say that the video was loading.  Don't know what the problem it but it is very disappointing!
B00785P2QC|3.0|This is better then I thought to would be when I got it it's a game that will pass the time
B003QCCS36|4.0|I found the lyrics in this collection of songs both humorous and introspective. The style of the music itself is somewhat predictable, and Ray still seems to be searching for his own unique sound.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|This was the first serious SciFi film. I remember they used to show a &#34;family friendly&#34; version of Family Classics where they edited out all the good parts, like the big battle with the Id Monster. It's fun watching all the first instances of situations that have become tropes for the genre.
B000GPIPVU|3.0|I enjoyed the experience of listening to several of the songs on this album, but its overall sound is rather repetitive, with few of the songs feeling unique.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Apparently, there are many people who think Alice in Chains can't exist without Layne Staley.  Guess what?  Alice in Chains has always been Jerry Cantrell.  If you can't live without Layne Staley, YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN BE REVIEWING THIS ALBUM.  People have no business giving an album poor reviews based on a bias.  Take the album for what it is; the new incarnation of Alice in Chains.<br />TDPDH has a more adult sounding grunge.  You can really tell Cantrell is getting better with age.  It ranks right up to par with BGWTB.  Amazing sound, great production, great layering, and just like some of their older material, they integrate harmony in the dissonance.  This album doesn't deserve anything less than 5 stars.  Do yourself a favor, and get this album, and put aside the bias.  Besides, the more you listen to it, the more amazing it gets.
B004RLPTT0|3.0|some of the songs on this album are awesome but others are just ok.  I really enjoy &#34;army of Me&#34; and &#34;White Rabbit&#34;
B0029LHW4U|5.0|William Duvall more than fills the shoes of his predecessor, he ups the ante.  AIC has never sounded better, this is coming from a fan of AIC since the beginning.  Jerry Cantrell has mastered the grunge sound.  Grunge may be dead, but Jerry unquestionably made this work wonderfully.  No way somebody could regret this purchase.<br />The pacing of the album is fantastic, it brings you up, levels out, then brings you up more.  Can't wait for more material!
0446581356|5.0|I love the way this book teaches you about skin right through to what to keep in your pro kit.<br />Has lots of clear pictures, great purchase.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book, and the first one in the trilogy, Fall of Giants, is so wonderful.  I actually liked the first one even better, because it was a time period that I find most interesting.  It was quite interesting to follow the characters in the first book, and then their children in the second book.  I am ready for the 3rd and final book now !!!  Ken Follett is such an excellent writer for these kinds of epic novels.  His character involvement and development is full and rich.  These aren't light reads by any means.  But they are consuming and fascinating.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is fun and easy to use. I love checking on my horse and feeding/grooming her. I highly recommend for all ages!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I will be following Will Robie. Baldacci has a page turner going with all kinds of room to build Will into a most memorable character.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|I would watch a sequel, where he mentors his replacement.  It works in this &#34;Pass It On&#34; world we live in today.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I enjoyed this show very much and plan to watch the rest of the available seasons before the new season starts in the fall!
B000RHG4XS|5.0|This movie was amazing, better than the first, in fact this movie is on a whole other playing field!  Diego Luna was brilliant in this movie and not to mention super HOT!  The leading lady was just as good if not better than Jennifer Grey in the original.<br />  This movie's dancing was a lot better than the original too.  While the original movie's dancing was perfect for that time period, Havana Nights dancing was more up beat and sensual which suits the movie.  Overall this movie was amazing, if you're a fan of the original you WILL LOVE THIS!!!<br />  P.S. Patrick Swayze's(man, I hope I spelled that right) screen time was a surprise but really added to the movie and made me love Havana Nights more!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Listened to this book on audio all of yesterday. Angela Dawe is a great narrator. Thought the story was great and answered some questions.  And, I guest right on the ghost, so happy.  What characters are next?  Do start from the beginning with Slave to Sensation.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|A truly eye opening account of life<br />Inside North Korea's prison camps.<br />Shin's story is heart breaking, miraculous, and very riveting.
B008Q0CO0U|5.0|Hav watched three times and its better every time , mark wahlberg iS great you won't be disappointed  I promise that
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I would not have imagined the ending.... definitely worth reading. The author did a great job in pulling the reader right into the story. Enjoy!
B00821OX98|5.0|This is now my favorite show...I don't watch hardly any TV, but I will now! I will be watching all of season 3 each Sunday night...
B007CGIERQ|5.0|My favorite fantasy book! Try this author.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Upon first listen I was slightly disappointed. I think I was expecting a return to Songs for the Deaf with Grohl back on drums and Oliveri contributing. But after repeat listens I realized how glad I am they went in a different direction. The fusion of the Queen's sound with 70's rock has created an album that is inventive and yet familiar. ...Like Clockwork is one of the best rock records I have heard in years.
B00821OX98|5.0|I don't care much for TV Dramas, but this got my interest and I was hooked after the pilot.  I would never had noticed this except for Amazon prime
B00821OX98|5.0|Falling Skies has a lot of action and drama. It keeps you interested and wanting to see what will happen next.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I enjoyed this show so much, and found it by accident.  I remembered really like Kathrine McPhee on American Idol so I watched!  She was wonderful, and the rest of the cast.  Anjelica Huston is subperb and it was so great to see her in something new and exciting.
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|This movie is just awesome!  It is entertaining for the kids and for my and husband and myself.  There aren't inappropriate scenes or scantilly dressed female figures.  The story was comical and the dialogue was funny... it didn't exceed any boundaries for the children to hear and it allowed the adults to appreciate the story line
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I am glad to see that others were disappointed with this installment. I hated that it didn't end here. I screamed when I read her Author's not at the end. The storyline was choppy and it did seem like Ms. Day was grasping at the other characters to try and add to this story.<br />Spolier **<br />I liked that they got married and they way they did, private.<br />I liked that Cary blew up at Eva for keeping her secrets and not trusting him.<br />I liked that Mark & Stephen got engaged.<br />I liked that Eva's dad found out about Nathan.<br /><br />I did not like....well too many different things to mention.<br /><br />Sad that I wasted money on this and I will wait to see what happens in the 4th and 5th series from the free library.... Sorry Ms. Day, you lost me as a fan. This book proved to me that you are in this series for the money and I am sad I just gave you my $10.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The ending was terrible and the book was overall lackluster. Focused more on sex than on a real plot with suspense. I hope the next book is SIGNIFICANTLY better!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It has been the best app I ever spent money on. It keeps him busy for hours and I am very happy it is not a shooting or killing game.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Love the cd, Would highly recommend to any one that likes this type of music whether for yourself or for a gift.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like this game it's a good way to pass time. My kids love it. It does get kind of old that the missions repeat themselves so often
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|Come on folks...give us all a break please!<br /><br />The movie was OK!  The effects were fine.  But the story was yet another rehash of the crazy Khan (or is it Kahn??) narrative.  What was the budget for the writing/screenplay on this?  It should have been about $2500 tops.<br /><br />JJ blew it when he decided to rehash the 'Wrath of Khan' storyline.  There is simply no topping the original in my book.  And Sherlock Holmes as Khan...come on now JJ...did BBC-2 do your casting?<br /><br />The role reversal (Kirk dying/resurecting, Spock screaming 'Khaaaaaaaaaan) was formulaic and in all honesty a little pathetic to my mind.  I actually laughed out loud when Spock screamed.<br /><br />When it gets released on DVD...my guess is that is will rapidly make it into the discount bin.<br /><br />At least it will give 'The Voyage Home' some company on the bottom of the 'favorite' Star Trek movie heap.
B003QSPTAY|5.0|Thjis is a classic that my kids and now my grand kids enjoy watching again and again. It never gets old and Hayley Mills is perfect fr both parts. I highly recommend it for families with children. I still enjoy watching it myself.
B004XVN1T4|5.0|And the beat goes on. Follett has a way of keeping you on the edge of your seat until the last page, when you suddenly come to the realization that this  shadow war is still going on and that we someday may be caught in the &#34;fallout&#34; of it all.
0425263924|5.0|I can't believe all the moaning and groaning on this site by people who are upset that this is not the last book in a trilogy.  Anyone who is really into this series knew that Sylvia herself said this series was a quintet (that means 5 books folks!!).  This book was a great 3 book in a 5 book series.  It was NOT filler.  When I started reading the book, I was sure I would hate it after reading the reviews here.  I was surprised.  I loved the book!!  I won't spoil it for others by putting my favorite parts here.  BUT if you are trying to decide whether to read this book, please do not let the spoilsports on this site keep you from it.  Has no one ever heard the phrase \\"anticipation heightens the pleasure\\"?  Everyone on here seems to want instant gratification....what are you going to do when the Crossfire TV series starts?  I guess expect to see everything the first night!
B00C5GZKVQ|1.0|Monotonous. Repetitious.  This one wears thin pretty fast.  Needs more than quick battles in the same environment.  Yawn. Another yawn.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I couldn't put it down after I started reading! I wasn't a huge fan of the ending, but I still enjoyed the book.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is a hilarious story of a manwhore brought to his knees. No pun intended. It's laugh out loud funny.
1781162646|4.0|The story was a little slow developing--the stage was set quickly but the conflict took a good while to really emerge--but overall the book was an enjoyable read. The characters were good, not great, and fleshed out with King's usual thoroughness. Really, there's not a lot to say about the book, it's a pretty simple, straightforward read which will easily waste away an afternoon, but it's not something that you'll end up remembering a few years in the future.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Love the book and as does Sheryl Sandber I encourage women to take risks and &#34;sit at the table&#34;<br />I definitely recommended the book
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This novel has change a lot of what I think. I laughed and cried plenty. I loved Augustus and I loved Hazel and I wanted to be loved and to love as deeply and honestly as they love each other. Truly a hopeful novel filled joy and light. Please give yourself the gift of reading it.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This stuff brought down my CPU temperature by 5 degrees C while idle with an AMD Phenom II Quad Core and on average by 8 Degree C when running demanding applications such as crysis 3
B0078X2LKY|5.0|What can I say, my children loves this silly Grover story. They get a kick out of turning the pages and want me to read it to them again and again.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I preordered this book almost 9 months ago. I was upset that the release date was pushed back 6 months but guessed it was because they wanted to get more folks to buy the last book first. Who knows. Now I'm guessing that Sylvia wrote a complete third installment to the trilogy, was then told by her publishers that since sales of the last book were so good to redo the third installment to stretch it out. I get it. More money for the author, more books for everyone - seems like a win win. Somewhere along the way integrity was compromised and now, I'm afraid, the gamble is causing irrevocable damage to this author and her future fan base. Sad because Sylvia, you are a good author. But storytelling is an art and you exploited yourself, putting financial gain above staying true to yourself, what you obviously love to do, and what you're good at.
B00A6C3JN2|5.0|This one has a lot of analog and pwm pins and really good for robotic!<br />And has both 3.3v and 5v, I can use more module on this board.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I was shocked when I watched this for the first time. I was hooked. I love watching there interaction with the each other is refreshing.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Downloaded this app and installed it on my Android tablets (Wife and I have 3 of them) and love they way they work, absolutely perfect for reading Kindle formatted ebooks on devices that Aren't Kindle.
B0045XGRQE|4.0|This is the first movie I have &#34;rented&#34; from Amazon.  I love the ease of being able to rent the movie and download using the amazon instant video app.  My only feedback is that it took close to an hour to down load the move in HD.  I have high speed internet, with average download speed of around 10Mb.  I was getting ready to leave on a trip and this was a last minute thought, I almost had to leave before the download completed.  Next time I will allow the time to get the download complete.
0756655307|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my superhero loving daughter and it did NOT disappoint! She and I are both learning so much about the Marvel Universe that even my comic book loving brother didn't know! Great job!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|The story line has been exciting & thrilling, taking the audience on a heart stopping ride at the end. Hated to lose Tommy though. Love Felicity. I think Ollie & Laurel are never going to be on the same page, but Felicity & Ollie I hope get together.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|After reading all the reviews I've decided not to waste my money on this book.  I'm very sad because I loved these two characters and couldn't wait for their happily ever after.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|So magical and while dark, it showed how monsters made in blood are given absolution with honesty, love, and vengeance. The real archangels Michael and Raphael as instruments, exacted retribution and the hero with shields of obsidian manages to do just that. It is the magical eyes of a fractured little girl who preserves sanity in the face of horrors wrought by an insane Councillor. So many answers to so many niggling questions~ even Hawke and Sienna have to sit and watch this play out. Absolutely can't wait til next spring....oh yeah, touch is important for Psy as much as it is for humans as well as changelings, just ask Walker.....and Zach...he he....
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Often a movie will be a disappointment after reading the book, but not so here.  Of course there can't be as many details as in the book, but this movie is like a Reader's Digest condensed book.  You don't miss what's been left out.  The story is amazing and quite eye-opening as to what it was really like in the South during this time period.  It's definitely a not-to-be-missed story.
B00170DEM8|5.0|The first movie to feature the Irving Berlin classic &#34;White Christmas,&#34; this movie is by far my all-time favorite Christmas movie!!! Old-fashioned and corny, it is delightful from beginning to end! Bing Crosby will capture your heart singing and wait'll you get a load of Fred Astaire's dancing (to paraphrase from the movie)!!
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Im a big fan of Lee Childs Jack Reacher books. I was a little disappointed when I saw Tom Cruise playing Jack Reacher, but Cruise did not disappoint. This movie was awesome from beginning to end and I hope they do another
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Star Trek was a great movie. A brilliant way to keep the Star Trek saga going. Two thumbs way up!
B005OGS5BG|5.0|Great movie. Excellent new condition. I love this movie but in blu ray it's awesome. Blonde is blonder and funner!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|For the Curious ones( THERE IS NO SEX SCENE)..<br />This package was received in time from USPS.<br />Nicely Packaged without any damage.<br />The shipping delivery was good<br />The deleted scenes and the effects shown in this collection was amazngly cool!.<br />Extended and alternatives scenes are worth watching!!<br />Will buy from this seller again<br />Trusted Seller A++
B006RECSBC|1.0|Boring, terrible acting, predictable plot that a child could have written, unoriginal - the unbeatable hotel horror movie is the shining
1741797802|5.0|I bought this book as a present for a friend who desperately wants to travel to India!<br />I think it has only further motivated her to save for the trip! She tells me she can't stop reading it :)
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|Enjoyed this movie dispite not being a twilight fan. Kinda like not likeing harry potter but enjoying percy the lightning thief.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|An action packed filmed that keeps it light hearted and entertaining.  Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman and John Malkovich are at their best.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I absolutely love the game.... I can play for hours on end without ever getting bored of it. But I'm tired of waiting for the update to come out. All my friends with I Pads have the update, but I still can't get it. But overall, it is my fave game of all time.
B004RL9T50|5.0|It is a super funny family friend flick. It's good for people of all ages. Something for everyone in megamind.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|This is great television, and Maggie Smith is simply the best.  On a side note, the music is wonderful as well!  Love the music!!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I really love the show \\"Castle\\". At one time, \\"Bones\\"  was my favorite but it has dropped to number two on my list because Castle is \\"da bomb\\" I hope it never goes off the air. I am anxiously awaiting the new season. Mary
B0087EACJK|4.0|This is a fun game to play. It can be a bit challenging at times, and beating the to e to get extra points is hard, but that doesn't matter, because thankfully you can go to the next level as long as you got through the previous level.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|Destined for cult classic collections. Add it to your inventory; sitting on the shelf with Tremors and Sean of the Dead, this is a constant laugh. Simply fun to watch.
B008OOYALE|4.0|The game is fun, however it takes forever to earn money, expand, grow food, hatch eggs. So the game is kind of slow to get anything, and you have to ask others for stuff to expand and visit their island.
0399215921|1.0|This is not in the product information when I purchased it. I thought it was a normal-size-book. However, this is only as big as my palm. This is not what I want. Amazon is very generous to its clients and solved my problem in no time.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Lots of fun, lots of dragons to get. Full of new things to do and purchase. Breeding and building take awhile, but that's all.
0694003611|5.0|My daughter loves the book and likes to point at things in the book. We love the bunny and the great green room too!
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|I loved the idea or this game, and it was fun to play. However, I disliked that you didn't have the option to skip a level, so if you couldn't pass one you were forced to use power ups, and they only give you 2 of those.
0399226907|5.0|My 2-year-old daughter wants us to read this book every morning. She really loves it. It is a great book!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The app works, but after awhile just constantly forced closed, causing me to end up having to uninstall the app.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I had to let my mind marinate a bit before writing this review. Not sure how to word what I really wanted to say here.<br /><br />Book One - Bared to you, I gave three stars. Like many others I had just finished Fifty Shades of Grey and was looking to ride the train a little longer. I was good, not amazing but good.<br /><br />Book Two- Reflected in You, I gave an astonishing five stars because I simply could not put it down. Yes I was a blurry eyed reader at 3 am just striving to get to the end.<br /><br />Book Three- Hhhhmmmmm........... I had no idea going in that the Crossfire series was changed from a three book series to now a five book series. Queue light bulb! Now I get it. Not gonna comment to much on that topic..... maybe.<br /><br />I felt like EWY started pretty strong. Right where we left off. I didn't realize just how much I missed these guys. I also forgotten how much I liked the natural conversation these two have when they spar with one another.<br /><br />\\"...he murmured. \\"Of course, you're my favorite ride.\\"<br />\\"Aw, that's sweet, baby. And you're my favorite joystick.\\"<br /><br />\\"Can I take advantage of you in the limo?\\" His eyes laughed at me. \\"By all means, angel mine.\\"<br /><br />I found myself highlighting so much of the sweet and sexy comments between these two. Something I didn't do with the first two books.<br /><br />\\"Angel, a crowd of millions couldn't hide<br />you from me. I found you once. I'll always find you.\\"<br /><br />\\"There wasn't a second that passed when you weren't on my mind. You own me, Eva. Wherever I am, whatever I'm doing, I belong to you.\\"<br /><br />So the major plot/storyline gets resolved in EWY. We aren't left hanging toooooo much. There is a plot twist/change. (I kinda feel that happened to enable another book(s))<br /><br />We get a real good look into secondary characters. Many more subplots going on in the background (again I think to allow for more books)<br /><br />But to get back to Gideon and Eva we have no relationship cliffhanger this time around. And THAT I was thrilled over. I think they were solid in EWY. Grown up and smart even. I loved them as a couple and the \\"team of us\\" they showed each other.<br /><br />I am not going into to much detail as the book was just released yesterday and I want to be relatively spoiler free.<br /><br />I am going to give a strong 3.75 Stars (reverting to Star Search scoring on this one)<br /><br />I wanted say I am not sure if I will be buying the next one but come on who are we kidding? When it comes out I will be pre-ordering and reading the teasers along with everyone else cause lawdy have ya heard Gideon?<br /><br />\\"I look at you, angel, and I want you so badly.

B00BDRJ3Z2|5.0|Luke Bryan sings about partying and drinkin' beer what more do you need from a summer album.  Worth the purchase.
B00BQXWH2O|5.0|Armin never stops surprising me. There is a reason why he is the #1 Dj...<br />Every single song in this album has its own charm. I have not stopped listening to this album ever since I bought it because it is indeed an addictive master piece.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Excellent book on relationships and marriage. Understanding your spouse is one of the most important skills you can learn to strengthen and nurture your marriage. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves marriage and wants to sustain their love.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Pulled me right in by the scruff of my neck and didn't let go till the drama finished. Subtle and powerful. I feel like the two of them are family now.<br /><br />Jack Underhill
B002N57KG2|5.0|It was never opened, and it was inside the plastic package, with no cracks, dents, nothing. It made a great present for my mom.
0321525655|1.0|I didn't buy this book to learn Japanese! The book has some good points but I don't like the continued focus on Apple corp and Steve Jobs.
B008E374PO|5.0|Every song is amazing/fun/poetic/sounds great. Perfect for the road, dancing, singing along, making videos, and being alone or with friends.
B00BSWMITK|3.0|The only song that has really grabbed me on this one is &#34;Shine On American Dreamer&#34;.  Haven't enjoyed much else......The reason it reminds of Engines is that I only like one song on that album also...
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I love HO games and this is great. The story is good. Just one thing I wish the gave more chapters
B0018OFN1S|4.0|Had fun watching it with along with my spouse.  Good movie for the time when it was shot.  Gives an idea of night second life
B009R659L8|5.0|Heidi<br /><br />Bfjdjdjdjdhjdidjdj jdjdjdjdhdhdududjejrjrurjhfurj  higher d d d and a few days later this month. The only a small business owner and the rest
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A deeply touching book that gracefully moved from past and present. Well developed characters made for an engaging and sometimes heartbreaking read.
B002U3CCF6|5.0|I really love this authors books. Great mystery all the way to the end. Gone girl and dark places were also a great read.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Love being able to download some of my favorite photo's in here. Love my Kindle. Take it everywhere with me.
B00COMLLX2|5.0|I've been waiting for a while now for zen pinball to hit the app store. It was worth the wait.
1595822003|5.0|Excellent illustrations to a great story that has been altered through the years to fit into a movie. I must buy for sketch artists.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Couldn't wait for this one to come out! I loved it, kept me intrigued and captivated, I enjoyed this story line tremendously and the characters pulled me in so much I couldn't put it down. Excellent writer and I truly enjoyed it, I am anxious for the next one to read now. I felt like it kept me reading and pulled in and I was truly enjoyed her writing. Highly recommended!!!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Many questions answered, several yet to be addressed.<br />Some might see this as the end, but the war is not yet won.<br />Onward.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This is an amazing book which is completely different than the first but incredible none the less. It had me captivated the entire time just like the first but in a different way. Speaker for the Dead made me take a step back and try not to judge other cultures so much, and even people. I wish speakers were real after reading this book. It could help heal a families wounds that may never get the healing otherwise by not talking about their past transgressions with the dead.
B005XN31LY|5.0|I love fairy tales.  This show was cleverly done with the right actors playing the roles.  I loved it and am looking forward to watching season 2.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|This app is so fun and easy to use. I love to doodle then share work with my friends. Plus changing my old photos is so cool.
1616614609|5.0|I'm pretty new to card based games like this outside of playing a bunch of Magic: The Gathering when I was in school. However, this game is absolutely fantastic. Reading through the directions can cause some befuddlement, but once you play a game or two things click into place. Not only can you just play the standard decks, but it becomes even more about strategy once you start building your own decks from the available cards. Great variety in the runner and corporation styles and I love the card artwork style.<br /><br />This game has a real sense of what it is and does a great job of immersing you in the world. Enough so that my wife and I now use terms from the game in real life. I was cooking the other day and had too many things going and ran out of time to cook some green beans. My wife slyly observed that I had run out of clicks. I know something is pervasive when it becomes a casual reference.
1475143389|5.0|I was looking at different approaches to lifting weights so I headed for Amazon and looked for bodybuilding books.  This one had caught my interest because it explains a lot of things that people don't know about health, nutrition and fitness, and the biggest myths and mistakes of building muscle.<br /><br />At first, I didn't like it much because it talked about a bunch of vocabulary, but when I continued reading, it all started to make sense because without the proper vocabulary you can't understand what you're reading.  Then it goes on with the importance of nutrition, the good and bad nutrients and meals, how to make a meal plan if you want to cut, maintain or bulk.<br /><br />Then comes the workouts, and although this is not a book about workouts, there are enough included in the additional free report, for a whole year.<br /><br />Finally, the author gets to the supplements, which ones work, and which ones don't, so you can save a lot of money in useless supplements.<br /><br />Very easy read. Highly recommended book.
B0039YZPZ4|3.0|This is a pretty good movie though I think the sequel is superior. It's entertaining, but has a few annoying plot holes. Pretty good mindless fun.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|WHAT A GREAT GAME, I LOVE PLAYING THIS!!!!! I WISH MORE GAMES LIKE THIS COULD BE INCLUDED FOR FREE PLAY!!!!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Nothing like a little suspense to get you through the summer. Can't wait to see what happens next! The characters continue to develop and gain depth. Keep up the good work!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It the best game ever I'm 12 I played when I was 10 I love it then I play temple run and temple 2 but they never got updated so I went back to subway surfers I love it from Holloween- Miami
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I was drawn by the cruelty of sacrificing children of the rebellious and the emotional detachment and heartlessness of the victors.  The pacing was a bit slow and the story somewhat predictable, however, Jennifer Lawrence's acting is powerful.
B000005ILF|5.0|Wonderful record, featuring Sting's main collaborators at the time.  Features a distinct exploration of Stax-style R&B and one of his loveliest mixed-meter tunes: \\"I Was Brought To My Senses,\\" also some great performances by the late, great Kenny Kirkland.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|Yes, The Fountainhead remains at the very top of my list of Best Novels ever written, along with Atlas Shrugged. The characters may be a bit less developed by Ms. Rand than in Gatsby, however it is an inspirational and motivational work. Timeless in it's message!
B0002VFXFE|4.0|Product goes on smoothly and spreads out evenly under pressure. I used this when I was remounting a GPU heat sink on an AMD Radeon 5870 and have had no thermal issues since the remount.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I was tempted to give this 5 stars, because it is such an interesting topic.  I wish there would have been more everyday, down to earth examples and more practical advice in addition to all the Harvard business school, academic, and business related stuff.  In a way this book only scratches the surfaces when you begin to think about this topic.  However, the book has lots of good, interesting, information, and it is easy to read.  I will be recommending it to others.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|But definitely worth the wait .<br />So that is all I wanted to say but Amazon requires more words so how about the terrible technical performance of the Amazon system?  I stream movies from many sites but the only one that interrupts the show 2 -3 times with a &#34;wait - down loading message&#34; is Amazon.  Pretty disappointing from a company who seems to prode it self on being technically so savvy.
B003SHDP4K|5.0|Really really good read, a definate page turner. Couldnt put the book down. Would highly recommend to anyone questioning it. Have been recommended myself a couple of times by other people too
B005USZML4|5.0|Interesting ,wholesome and intriguing at times. Love the setting and story line. It seems like I've gotten to know Theo who is a great kid, who's intelligent and mature but still a kid.
B00BVYKWJI|4.0|I am Borgia!  I can't wait for season 3.  Jeremy Irons is great as the Pope.  This series makes you wonder if this is how the church was back in the day!  I have watched both Borgia (which is a little more graphic!) and The Borgia's and love both of them.  If you like this period of time, you should definitely watch The Borgia's!  I am looking forward to Season 3 which comes out in August.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I saw so many fantastic reviews on this book and figured I'd check out what the buzz was all about.  It's another irresistible bad boy romance and a heroine with some secrets of her own.  I will admit, there were a few interesting twists that kept me going, but in the end - it just was not \\"all that\\".<br /><br />I even bought the second book, but I'll hold off on reading it.
0425263916|5.0|Just wish the sequel would have been available sooner she is a great writer. Just bought another book of hers.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Great Movie and Sound Track.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|An awesome game great way to kill time it gives you creative freedom I play this game every time I get a. Chance just hard to earn golden star but I still.play
B0084IT59C|5.0|Great book at a decent price.  It is an added bonus to find it online and not have to drive to purchase.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Good read.  Was kinda bring more vamps, but I belie e the series ended the way tat it was supposed to.
B001NKI60W|5.0|Great movie and found it easily online and for a decent price.  It is an added bonus to not have to drive to the store.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|love love love this app but im kinda disappointed. Bc after level 7 I had to delete Bc it would not open I'm gonna dwnload again hopefully it works it sucks tho Bc I lost all my highscores!!!!!! :(
B000JML7EC|5.0|Arrived on time and in perfect condition. Thanks for having online and easy purchase without spending gas to drive somewhere.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|This is a very well done and fun CD.<br /><br />Yeah - you can tell they did some over dubbing and Mike's voice has been auto tuned so it is not a &#34;pure&#34; live CD -<br /><br />But it captures the fun of the concerts of one of the greatest bands of the 20th Century on what clearly appears to be the last tour of the real Beach Boys.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Great movie at a decent price.  It is an added bonus to find it online and not have to drive to purchase.<br />.
B007C4ZJ0S|1.0|i picked this up at a blockbuster closing for .99 and still feel like i wasted my money. the story, i have no idea as i was bored to death. the music is terrible. the action sequences with this soft music was terrible. i have no idea what any of these characters were doing nor did i care. idk who 'gina' is or was but her acting was like a mean lady working at the deli at Publix. so i fast forwarded through most of it and going tomorrow to get a 3.00 credit at Mr k's for a dvd i wouldnt use as a coaster. one of the worst i have seen in a long time. trust me, theres a reason why theyre a 150 used copies for sale at this writing.
B00BHMEALA|5.0|great movie, well done. acots did good job, one of the best movies i have seen. i highly recommend seeing it
B0048WQDIE|1.0|Though the writing skills of the author may be touted the story and what it portrays is totally disrespectable to the majority of military people who work hard and follow the rules. The author idolizes a few bozo’s who were slugs that took advantage of others. Though this book may seem funny to some people I found it deeply offensive.
B004JP5DHW|4.0|While the premise for Powder's strange powers is left to your imagination, his powers are only part of his story. This is a tale of living with your uniqueness, even if others criticize you and even bully you because of it. Powder is able to rise above negativity, maintain his human kindness despite his power to respond with unmatched retaliation. Powder rises above fear and ridicule, physical brutality and meanness and in the end shows us the value in self sacrifice and the gift of unconditional love.<br />This film is enjoyable at many levels and suitable for persons of all ages.<br />I gave it 4 stars because I felt that the script overplayed the special effects, and missed the opportunity to better develop the characters.
B00AF3ROM4|5.0|I don't know why Amazon.com isn't selling this book directly--I had to go through a third party seller--but if there's one thing Dan has proven, it's that all of his Robert Langdon books require illustrations. As much as I love the guy's work, I don't want to be strapped down to my computer while I'm reading and then have to STOP reading every five minutes because I have to look up pictures of whatever he just wrote about just so I can know what he's talking about. The alternativve is to continue reading without undertanding and that's just unacceptable. For any lover of the Robert Langdon series, these Illustrated Editions are a must have!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you like Temple Run you will love Subway Surfers. It is fun and addicting! Have fun playing Subway Surfers!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Well, where do I start? This book drags on and on, describing the water taxi that passes under the Brooklyn bridge to the police lady directing the flow of rush hour traffic. But what I want to find out is the conclusion of Eva and Gideon's story. I could care less about Megumi' s being sick and missing work for days on end. I want to find out about Cary's love life and who he'd choose at the end?  But if the whole suspense is to make another $10 to make us read the next book and be disappointed? Well, I'll just skip and assumed they live happily ever after, how about that?!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love it. it makes me feel like I am In the game wouldn't you want to be in the game!!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|One of the greatest movie series of all time...unbelievable ..i am excited to watch it jus like it just came out...
B008GWSS6W|5.0|If you like John Wayne, then you will love this classic. A western with a comedy twist. Take a little time to watch this one, you will be surprisedl
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|love it very awsome very good one of the best really good graphics and battle play out...addicting game needs work on social network...how bout a chat line?
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Who doesn't like Raiders?  I had been wanting to add these movies to my collection and was thrilled when Amazon offered the entire set on their &#34;Deal of the Day&#34; plus the set is Blu-Ray.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Very entertaining and action packed. Romance, action, fast-paced, twists and turns, good guys and bad guys! It was lots of fun!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I'm not much for romantic comedies but this one was excellent.  I enjoyed the all star british cast and likes the multiple plots that came together at the end.  Great for the holidays!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|its like the best game I got and played and pretty much every one I know has this they say it's awesome
0307592731|5.0|Beautifully written story that can't help but make you look at life in a new and better way.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B000J2BRQU|3.0|Ok not as good as the others.  Would hsvr expected to see more of the team.  It did tie in some questions i had.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|It was wonderful again at home in 3d.  I definitely recommend this for anyone.  It came on time, with no issues, just as promised.
B00CFOXBX2|3.0|SLOW START BUILDING TO A PROMISING AND TANGLED PSEODO-QUASI PSYCH THRILLER AND THEN FIZZES OUT MORPHING INTO ALL TOO PREDICTABLE PABULUM COMPLETE WITH A HOLLOWWOODY-HAPPY ENDING WITH A DOOR LEFT AJAR WIDE ENOUGH FOR A TRUCKFUL OF SEQUELS. ADMITTEDLY, IT BEATS BEING POKED IN THE EYE WITH A SHARP STICK FOR 2 HOURS.
B000007ODY|3.0|This was my first listening of Brahms. I am not ready for this kind of sound, however, the intricacies of his compositions are tremendous.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|this company has my respect. I only played two games, first i thought of Ash Ketchum from \\"pokemon\\" and it got it right. next i went with \\"Steve\\" from \\"Minecraft\\" and it still got it. any one who thinks to put those characters into an app like this clearly knows what he's doing. I recommend this app for everyone because it is just amazing.
B00CL66FEQ|3.0|It was a funny good movie with a feel good ending. There were some pretty funny scenes especially when she gets mad at her son and goes out to the bar without him. It wasn't outstanding but a good movie.
B0018OFN1S|5.0|huge fan of dom and letty.  had to see what started it all again before we went to # 6.  which was really good too.
0763619612|4.0|Book was purchased to use in a training event.  Very positive comments reagaring the book. Received the book very quickly.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this story, I could not put the book down in anticipation of how the love story would play out. Cannot wait to see the movie as well!
B0068LYEHA|5.0|I laughed so hard reading this book! She brings up serious issues in a way that makes you want to think about them differently and deeper. I really enjoyed reading this book (and ever re-read certain excerpts several times!)
B0072GPQNG|5.0|A beautiful movie.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves horse stories. The acting was great and the story line touching.
B009O07NDY|5.0|Just what I wanted all the music from the movie plus a few extras. If you liked the movie and the music get this.
0808586165|5.0|An absolutely brilliant story told in such a way that I did not want to put the book down.  There is a reason this book sits high up on so many science fiction and dystopian future must-read lists.  The author did an excellent job getting the reader's interest piqued in all of the characters, but especially Ender.  This really is a page-turner.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|The book is absolutely beautiful and I love the way they seal their love throughout the story. I am completely in love with Gideon Cross. And the sex...Wow! I was just not expecting the end to leave me hanging so it was a bit a of a shock. However, I'm really happy that there are more books on the way because I just can't get enough of Gideon and Eva. i love it!
0449011909|5.0|My single issue with this audio series is that the gentleman reading the books does not maintain vocal integrity with each character throughout the series. His rendition of each character's voice has changed through the separate books. He should review his rendering of each voice prior to doing each book, in order to remain consistent through the series. GRRM's authorship is, however, magnificent as always.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I really enjoyed watching Eureka at times it makes you laugh but most of all you can get into all the stories as you just can not wait till the next show to start!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Raised my expectations for the next book: The House of Hades<br /><br />I know Rick Riordan will meet those expectations though
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I have a hard time watching movies and shows based on books that I read. They never seem to satisfy me as much as the book did. This series stays true to the book. The casting stays true to the characters in the book so far.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome.I want to play it with friends. I wish I could think to be in .the game
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|This was very difficult to follow and the constant bid to purchase was frustrating to myself and my granddaughter.  Wish I had never opened this.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|that one word sums it up!  I would definitely say that this movie is a must see and will change the way you think about flying!
B008JFUUIA|4.0|I enjoyed it.  Lighthearted .... I did expect a bit more humor out of it, but all it if don't expect a classic you should see the humor in it.
0062082353|5.0|Great story told by Americas greatest sniper. While the writing is chopp \y and inconsistent, the autobiography of Chris Kyle needs to be told again and again. This man is a hero and a great American. God Bless CPO Kyle.
B008J34466|5.0|Its Pink... Either to you love her or not!  Some of the songs are edgy.... I wouldn't necessary recommend it younger kids.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Great movie. Came as described. Got it for cheaper than it was listed at local stores. Got it for my 9 year old daughter but even my 4 year old son loved it. Not much you could say negative about it.
B009D5VPTI|5.0|My daughter enjoys the movie and always wants to watch it whenever she gets the chance. I think it is just enough excitement for her.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|The movie is great. It came factory sealed and just as described. Got it in time for Christmas and we just watched it again the other day for family movie night.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Glad to be able to get this album! And I love that it is available through cloud to put on any device.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|When I started I was uncertain but when I got to the plane flight... It's my new favorite book. Everything is just amazing!
B008K8VDPU|3.0|I got this for the kids to play with.  They don't use it much, but it seems to do what it should for a piano app.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I was searching for a new read, something that would draw me in, and the reviews on this book were that they were on an Epic level of Game of Thrones, and Harry Potter mixed. Seeing I love both, I thought I would give it a shot. I read this book in a day, and I had a 6 month old son. And no I did not ignore him to do it. I just read it after he went to bed. I couldn't put it down! I am now awaiting the next book in this series. Just finished A Vow of Glory, and I loved it too! It is a awesome read, and I highly recommend it. Its great entertainment.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I got this for the kids, they love it.  I haven't even tried it yet.  Pretty good pacifier I guess
B00CH87HF4|5.0|It is fun but it gets hard fast and it takes a lot of farming to get money easier to level up than the last game
B001AQR3JY|5.0|I was so glad to have found this on Amazon. It was sold out at other places. It was everything I expected.<br />I would recommend it to all my friends.
B0025VLELQ|5.0|The Movie was all i rember from my days as a young boy.<br />Its was all i expetet well its was a good movie and still is and i will se it manny times and thanks four it and i hope i will finde som als in your NET
B000000OF6|5.0|If you are a fan, you must have this collection! Two full CDs full of all there best songs. I love it!
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|I normally watch everything to the end no matter how bad it is but this just wouldn't end so I gave up before the end.
B000002L68|5.0|This was the first album of any kind I owned and I still love it. I think this was his first big album. The music comes from his first film, Purple Rain.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I still love these books so much! If your reading this right now, just read it! Best book ever! Read it!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This is the best app I have ever gotten! I have played 50 times and he has only gotten it wrong 3 times! This app may seem like you will get bored within the first 5 minutes but it is so amazing you won't be able to stop playing! I very highly suggest this app!
B000FC12Z0|3.0|The novel was written in the 30's and we are more sophisticated today.  It was an interesting read since I have spent time in Istanbul and visited the hotel where she wrote the novel.
B008MA83HC|5.0|Great songs.  Greatest hits. Si no te hubieras ido and Hasta que te conoci are great songs recorded as just Mana could with their unique taste music arrangements!  I highly recommend and would buy again if necessary!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this games!!<br />so addictive cant get enough. just wish I didn't have to buy coins. but then again I can wait
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|I bought the movie because Robert Pattinson was in it. I really like the movie watched it several times. It is very weird, but interesting at the same time. Kept me capitvated. Pattinson has proved that he is a good actor and probably go far.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is my favorite kindle game. I recommend this game to all. It is fun to play and simple. 5stars!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This is a great series. All the episodes are profoundly creepy and well written. This was the one unaired episode. Worth the watch.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Quicker to navigate and communicated within the App than a phone version. Some learning curve in how it's set up compared to the website and other apps, but easily mastered.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|So I was expecting this book to be the final book in the series. Peeved that it isn't, but the story was good with the latest twists and turns involving exes, parents, co-workers, and roommates. I can't believe I'm saying this: I wish the author had cut out half of the sex scenes - of which there are way too many- to finish the series in this book. Especially for the price.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I'll admit I'm not a big &#34;Facebooker&#34; but it was easy to set up. Navigating has a learning curve, but it's not overly steep.
B005HEPL8K|4.0|it star trek the next generation. you probably already know whether you like it or not. In my case, I do
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|For some reason I couldn't figure how to get out of the Kindle's native Adobe app as easily as this. That written, they both seem to work equally well as readers.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I am very pleased to be able to use this application anywhere, any time. Especially during the Tornado and Severe Weather seasons. I can view the radar maps in addition to the future forecasts for my area. This is especially useful to avoiding driving to locations where bad weather is predicted.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|We went ahead and purchased the premium edition after playing with this for a while. Probably best to go through the entire game -- levels  and all -- and then see if it's something you'd like in a more challenging and extensive game.
B0094M0P4G|5.0|I love this movie, I did not see it until last year for the first time. The dancing and singing are great in my opinion.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|When's the next book coming out???? I need to know<br />I still give it 5 stars because it was hot and thrilling. Please write fast Sylvia Day!
0802130208|5.0|Hilarious shenanigans set against a backdrop of general New Orleans debauchery. Highly recommended for anyone wanting a laugh. A book you want to re-read.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|First of all, I would like to say how much I love SD and I was looking forward to this book coming out.  I REFUSED to read any of the reviews since my friends told me majority of the bad ones were from those who were purely upset that 2 more books were going to come out after this one, and they didn't even read the damn book...WHO CARES?!?!?  Why is anyone complaining that we are getting more Gideon?!??!  4, 5 6, 7, 8 9, 10 books?  Bring it on!!!!  The more Gideon, the better!  Yes, the series was supposed to be a trilogy but a few months back, SD announced that the series wasn't finished and there was no book limit.  All i can say to that is....GREAT, FREAKING AWESOME!<br /><br />After reading this book throughout the day and finishing it a few moments ago, I will say that this book did NOT let me down. I loved the first two books and this book brought out the same emotions as the first two, if not more.  From the first chapter to the last, I found myself crying, turned on, angry, happy, disappointed, shocked, happy and overjoyed.  SD brings out ALL of these emotions from her reader and for that, I'm grateful!  She did her job.<br /><br />I loved reading more about the other characters in the book and who knows, this book could be a good build up to the next book.  If so, I'm happy to read 300+ pages with Gideon in it.<br /><br />I personally loved where this book went, the sex scenes were HOT and did venture out a bit...which was AMAZING.  Dance clubs, modes of transportation...yes please!  Gideon truly loves Eva and you can tell that Eva loves him back just as much.  Yah, she didn't kill a woman for him but she shows him in her special ways.<br /><br />I personally love a little bit of drama so when Brett comes back into the mix, I found it entertaining.  When Corrine shows up, again...entertaining.  I couldn't put the book down...so with that...great job!!!<br /><br />The ending is a good one...no cliffhanger.  I would rather have the book end this way and transition in the next one with ease rather than having a cliffhanger in my mind for the next few months.<br /><br />Overall, I loved this book and I will be HAPPY to buy the next book for $9.99 when it comes out.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Awful Awful Awful!!! I was so excited and I truly dont know how the story took a turn for the worse really dissapointed would not but the rest of the books.... :(
B00AIBZLVY|3.0|Mama is nothing special; it has annoying CGI images, which seem to take something away from the substance of the film. In other words, it doesn't work for this genre, because it's distracting at best. This movie is a cross between The Exorcist and The Omen, but inferior in plot, character development, and depth. This is your typical run-of-the-mill horror film with sudden jolts that are supposed to scare you, but most are predictable. I didn't enjoy this one too much, but give it 3 stars (mediocre) due to some decent parts, and the music is pretty good.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This is great for a time saver.  One does not have to do a quick mental calculation changing fractions to decimals.
B004ULNJIU|5.0|I really enjoyed this, not exactly your average JS film. Good story, an adaptable plot, really well acted. I have recommended to all my friends and they like it to.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|This is specifically about the Extended Cut version of A Good Day to Die Hard.  I give it 4 out of 5 stars, it was good.  After watching the theatrical release of DH5 I was very disappointed, someone edited down that cut of the film who either was new to their job, or actively doesn't like the DH fans.  They butchered it.<br /><br />This extended cut version adds back in everything I was looking for in a good Die Hard movie.  The  yippee-kay-yay is back!  How can you release a Die Hard Movie without the main John McClane insult to his opponents?  This cut also has more character development, who is Jack McClane besides the 2 dimensional son of John McClane?  The action starts to make sense, to flow with the whole story.<br /><br />The theatrical release was a waste of my ticket, this extended cut version was worth every penny.  Buy it if you love Die Hard.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I'm a Sylvia Day fan and I've enjoyed this series. Was looking forward to read the 3rd book and yes, I sped read, and could not believe with the ending. I'm rooting for Gideon and Eva but I agree with most reviewers, the story is spread too thin. I felt drained reading about all of the characters and instead of wanting more, I'm done.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am still reading this book but it is really good.  I have liked the books better than the movie so far and the move was great.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Good character and plot development and the story holds a readers interest and intrigue.  Had fun trying to figure this one out!
B00133KFGW|5.0|This movie was one  of the best stories I have seen in a while.  I am very glad I purchased it.
B0090KZDSK|1.0|No! No! What have you done ..............You have lost the characters of book 1 and 2. Don't compete with other authors. You have a wonderful talent, be true to it.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Gameloft moves away from the arena fighting and back to adventure play, with arena aspects at certain storypoints. Only downside is the limits on usable weapons and skills without paying extra.
B00BR0LQ5K|4.0|although they seem to do mostly cover songs this band does them very well with a great sound all their own.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|Wonderful adaptation of Dahl's book. Over the top acting by the 'meanies' in the story and Mara Wilson shines as Matilda. It's definitely suitable for pre-teens and adults will enjoy it, too.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book is a real page turner - LOVED the way the story lines all came together at the end - a great book
0375842209|5.0|I just finished reading this beautiful and heart-wrenching book, so I am still a little overwhelmed by it at the moment. Zusak does an unbelievable job of capturing the beauty and cruelty of mankind. He achieved the impossible when he managed to reveal the goodness and love that existed during our world's darkest hour. His use of Death as the narrator was dangerous, but I can't imagine it from any other perspective. Death was everywhere at this time, and had first hand knowledge of every dark and twisted moment of this war, from the frozen battlefields of Russia, to the concentration camps in Germany itself. Yet, it is Death that discovers the capacity for human kindness in the midst of suffering, and it all starts when a little girl watches her little brother take his last breath.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|This one keeps you on the edge of your seat!  Unexpected events change the whole dynamics.  Can't wait for next season!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The cable fit the needs required.  The one we had was no longer working and this cable so far has worked perfectly.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|A real page turner.  Le Carre hasn't lost a step with his biting cynicism and well-developed plot.  I highly recommend it.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|takes way too long for the book to get going - i love to read and believe i love to read books ranging from 300 pages to 1,000 pages but this book moved to slow for my taste
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS APP, ANYONE WHO LOVES LITTLEST PET SHOP WILL LOVE THIS APP, ITS FULL OF SO MUCH FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :) :) :) :) :)
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I hope the movie has more action which the book lacked. Still it was fun to read but not exciting.
B008JFC6F0|5.0|I knew there were a few tunes that I liked but the entire album is terrific. This is a great add to my collection.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|This game is not HD, graphics is blurry, especially in main menu, and tiles are so small, that it makes impossible to play normally this games. I do not like this game at all.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|If I had the time right now, I'd write a big review of this wonderful book, or shall I say, relationship manual.  Amazing read.  Honestly.  It is baffling how accurate he is with so many points he raises.<br /><br />I recieved this as a present, and have given several out as presents as well.  It is always appreciated, and read more than once.  Also, every wife/mom/girlfriend I've ever befriended and given this to has their male couterparts read it as well to much benefit.<br /><br />Get it.  Read it.  Share it.
B0063M22QO|1.0|Graphics is very poor, game is quit boring and I simply can not get to next level. More over this game freeze from time to time making it impossible to get some fun. Uninstall, forever!
B006LSZECO|4.0|but the ending was disappointing....Book is well-written and engaging.  It turned out to be a quick read for me, but I do wish the ending had turned out differently.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The season two final episode is so engrossing I did not even know two hours had passed by. Enticing, intelligent, interesting.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Very fun game like the committee for lunch tomorrow but there are many second language learning  Marian the condo loves it was a bit of us are you doing well and the surroundings lovely gallery
B0033RT7RY|5.0|Great music, great acting, great message.  Amazon wants me to say more but I think I have said all there is.  Great flick.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book but was not happy with being left hanging at the end. I guess I will have to wait for Mr. Archer's next book.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|Can't there be any movies with good plot lines without all the foul language!! I would have been a better movie!!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I bought this book knowing that it was going to be gruesome to get through but I was so intrigued about Jaycee's story I had to read it. I was shocked every time the page turned, trying to imagine how horrific things must have been for her. My heart still goes out to the parents of that innocent child that was taken from their world. My worst nightmare is my child being stolen and not knowing if they are being tortured. I recommend this book to help you put your own life into prospective and to help you remember what is important in life.
B00005V1B1|5.0|Nice to have the REAL album cover. This band is a group of real musicians, Did not have all the new tech. to cover mistakes like today's bands do.
B009CF3P7E|5.0|OK, I'm a confirmed Star Trek fan, but I really love how they took the Star Trek history and 'modernized' it.  An excellent cast, lots of action and a good story. I have to have it on all my electronic devices so I can rewatch whenever I want.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The Sound of Music is my favorite movie of all time.<br />Brought it so that my kids could watch it .
B00785P2QC|5.0|The game is well built and very addictive. Very good game! Good choice for people that like this kind of game. I recommend this game.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I caught a glance at the show while a roommate was watching it. I thought I'd give it a try. I watched the pilot and was instantly hooked
0300169787|5.0|It's a real coffee table book, the pictures are gorgeous & it has enough content to actually be informative as well as fascinating.  I'm not particularly into fashion, but these pieces are just art.  Also, they are shot on models who have been painted & digitally altered to appear an mannequins so the posing is really organic.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|An amazing read taking you right into the mindset of the author. I was scared reading the novel, but could not put it down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love sub way surfers. I would give it five out of five.It is my favourite game in the world.I am obsessed with the game.I would recommend this game for temple runers and everyone else.This game includes mystery boxes, avatars and a mindblowing track that you get to run on.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|We finally get to know Gideon & Eva!!!! The long awaited reflected in you did not disappoint and left you wanting more.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|WOW. Quite a story. Mr. Crouch almost made you think you were<br />living within the story. Some day we may even live in world<br />Such as described in his book<br />PINES really held your attention and a hard book to put<br />Down.
B004Z7AHZC|4.0|GIFT 4 SOMEONE ELSE, REQUESTED BY THEM, SO I'M NOT SURE HOW TO RATE THIS ITEM, I DON'T KNOW MUCH MORE
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I got this is on of my favorite games<br />Because you earn money fast and can upgrade cars mother suspension tries and your drive like 4x4
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|This show sometimes hurts you to watch because of the subject matter.  It's scarry, but more than that it's disturbing and sometimes uncomfortable to set through it, until the next episode comes out.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I love how u can shoot pine cones at the animals and how you get three chances until u die on this game it is really fun
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Sometimes I don't want to use my phone so I got this alarm for my Kindle and its great. I use it for many different things and it goes off no matter what I'm doing.
B00AEFY3DQ|4.0|It matters little if you are a die hard Trekker, a Star Wars fanatic, a devoted follower of all things Whedon, or any of the unlimited sources for scifi/fantasy films and shows, there is something here for you! A stellar cast and a solid script make Galaxy Quest worthwhile by any standard, but for the lover of scifi, treasures abound! P.S. The bonus features are a hoot and a half - especially the quarters of Dr. Lazarus!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Very cute and fun game. I really do enjoy games like this for portable devices. It was free too! Can't go wrong ;)
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The story of Eva and Gideon continues with Entwined With You picking up where Reflected in You ends. As Eva tries to find her way back to her dark and dangerous lover she runs into many road blocks. Both Eva and Gideon have to deal with past intercessions coming back to haunt them, family trying to stop them and well-meaning friends. This makes for a messed up reunion with lots of hot sex because the chemistry between these two is amazing. Many people are disappointed that the series is not ending with this book. I for one am glad it is going on to more books. The Eva and Gideon story would have been wrapped up with a nice little bow and that is not how these two very broken people's story should end. It's going to take a lot to get that bow if ever and I want to thank Ms. Day for not taking the easy route and making the story continue. As readers we often beg our authors to continue the storyline, write spinoffs, or anything. Here an author takes the less traveled road and writes the true story she wants and I for one am really am enjoying where she is taking me and am so excited to see where the story goes next.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|written for girls but a fun read for anyone.  easy flow and story line to follow a heroine through her adventures.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Entwined with you is okay.  There are parts to the story that remind of you of how good the first two books were.  But certain characters are given more airtime than they are worth.  And the storyline is not cohesive.  The ending is abrupt.  The whole book felt like it was setting you up for the now two more subsequent books.<br /><br />I chose to return this book, as I expected this book to be the end of the supposed trilogy.  I think that it was a ridiculously greedy move by Sylvia Day and her publishers to extend this storyline beyond its appropriate time.  And to offer us this mediocre book right now.  Most of the readers of these books (and other such romance novels) want a wrapped up storyline.  We are patient with sequels, but I know that a lot of us prefer a standalone story as well.  But the drag along factor going on here is not to extend a great storyline.  It is solely to extend this cash cow, which is a disservice to the readers.  I hope other authors and publishers take note of how these actions were received by the majority of the romance readers out there!!!
0060723513|5.0|Makes you look at the world around you and realize... Let nature take its course and it will come to you.
B001THZAAI|5.0|Since so much of the humor is language-based, I was skeptical about using it, but the English subtitles are very clever about communicating intuitively the linguistic issues at play.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|boring.  not incentive just plain boring.  did i say boring and no incentive already. yes it is no longer with me.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|The action was great, the story typical for James Bond. I'm not a huge James Bond fan but this on was well done.
0525953728|5.0|excellent book, could not put it down, i can't thank the men and women enough for serving our country. everyone should read this book.
B0030B624E|5.0|I enjoyed the movie. A bit light hearted, but funny and entertaining. If you like zombie movies and you wants a few laughs try this.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|My stock cpu fan began to fail after approx a year and a half.  It just wore out I guess.  I did not notice this fact until I began to receive an alarm warning of overheating on my pc.  This is actually the first time this situation has occurred to me in approaching 2 decades of ownership and building my own.  I do routine maintenance and well  I guess anything can occurr.<br /><br />So I powered down and waited for this cooler to arrive after a bit of research and determining that this was the part for me.  Since this went into an older case I did have to break everything down for installation, but that wasn't that much of a hassle, maybe would be if you were inexperienced with working with these parts.<br /><br />The mounting hardware was perfectly aligned for my AMD setup on this machine and once I carefully ensured everything was seated properly I was able to reassemble everything without problems.  The included hardware for an additional fan on the cooler is a nice touch, but for me will not be necessary on this machine.  I decided to set the bios to &#34;Performance&#34; to see what the temperature was like and the Cooler Master CPU cooler was able to keep temps down to a nominal temp, below what my temps were with the standard setting and the stock CPU.<br /><br />So I was able to OC this machine and keep temps slightly below the previous fan.  This is a great device, and I am glad to experience the same performance as others that give this device great reviews.
1932100660|5.0|I'm reading this book now and I love all the information in it.  Dr. Campbell put a lifetime of study in this book and it's worth the read.  I haven't bought his new book, Whole, yet, but I will when I finish this one.<br /><br />Newly vegan and loving it!
B0074VTHKM|5.0|Great reading, exciting and very vivid-like all his books, loved it!  Wished it were a few more chapters longer; nevertheless, great reading.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The author did some of her best writing in the third volume of this set...she keeps a storyline strong that the reader is constantly looking for the surprise and makes this type of book interesting and enjoyable to read...disappointed it didn't end.... That was cruel... It is starting to go all over the place...end it and start new series
B004W1GCNC|5.0|2013-06-05
B004G7UTXG|4.0|Well acted, fictional story about colonial South America.  The story is based on the 1750 Treaty of Madrid and some of the resulting injustices and greed between Spain, Portugal, the Catholic church, and the indigenous people.  The scenery alone is worth watching.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a very fun game and very addicting I have so much fun playing this I can hardly walk away.
0783240287|2.0|This show is an absolute blast, especially when seen live.  This DVD is an interesting concept, having been staged exclusively for DVD, and not just a filmed version of a stageplay, but the sound is dreadful.  The individual soloists, especially the narrator, are way too loud, but the choral numbers are much, much too quiet, and lose their impact.  Also, my favorite number, &#34;Those Canaan Days&#34; has a spot where all the brothers hang onto a note forever and then, in all other productions I've seen, perform an audible gasp for air which generates howls of laughter.  On this production, there is no such gasp, and the effect is lost.<br /><br />No complaints about any of the cast members, but the sound is just dreadful, and inexcusable for this day and age.
B008M87GJK|4.0|I pull up the BBC News at least twice a day and find it excellent.  Veup to datery informative and
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|This is a very funny movie with comical scenes. Not huge fan of Bruce Willis, but, he brought the movie together. Take time to watch the action packed movie.

B00932A4XE|5.0|If you get a chance, set down and watch this movie. Great actors and funny situations. I will watch again.
0374158460|2.0|I sincerely miss those heavy metal bands<br />I used to go see on the landing in the summer<br />She fell in love with the drummer<br />She fell in love with the drummer<br />She fell in love<br />- Wilco<br /><br />[Originally offered as a comment to another review, but since reviews are still filing in, I guess I'll make mine count.]<br /><br />The main narrative seems to track the once scandalous [a Georgia sheriff closed down a cinema and the case went all the way to the SC] 1972 film \\"Carnal Knowledge\\". Roommates at Amherst, Art Garfunkel was the moony romantic nice boy and Jack Nicholson the feral, serial stud, and Candice Bergen the not entirely nice girl. It did not end up well for them, Jack giving a slide show of the \\"ball busters\\" he had known. One does wonder what makes Katz so constantly successful, and a little voice suggests exigencies of the plot.<br /><br />Speaking of \\"ball busters\\" and de rigueur nods to feminism, does any woman in \\"Freedom\\" come off well? (Granted the men aren't much to write home about either.) Joyce the distant mother, the crazy spinster sisters, Patrizia the drip, Eliza the crazed junkie, Carol the kept woman, Connie the psychotic Saint Slut??? (I mean really, didn't you spend 400 pages wonder how Joey was ever going to wriggle free?), Lalitha the competent young home wrecker, and the painfully beautiful Jenna. Was Jenna anything but a 75 page set up for a scatological joke? Only Jessica seems stable, and she drifts out of the picture, apparently for taking the \\"wrong\\" side.<br /><br />There seems to be an awful lot of throw away plot. Did Patty's date-rape give any insight into her character? or political patronage? I can't say Eliza bothers me, because she seemed to be irrelevant. I'm not a particularly sensitive reader, so the poorly delimited \\"autobiography\\" didn't faze me either because it sounded just the same and didn't seem to matter.<br /><br />Like Lake Woebegone, the women are all handsome and the children all extraordinary. In particular, Patty starts out a \\"she monkey\\" but ends up \\"well formed\\" and a succubus on Seth's imagination, Jenna is merely the most beautiful woman Joey ever saw, and Joey himself is buff and blond - although IIRC only mentioned at the end of the tale.<br /><br />That all said, I was enjoying the book. I came in with no awareness or expectations other than my son's recommendation as perhaps the most important recent contemporary work. The writing is very good and I did have a couple laugh out loud moments - Patty's tag out in her first softball game - and the potential movement name, the fascist Elbow Room!-) It's all hooey, arms dealing at 20!? \\"competitive\\" Patty not tossing out Lalisha on her ear!, and I've no insight but I thought spending three years dwelling on the details of three couplings was something only one sex would be prone to. But as a wish-fulfillment fantasy, you could look at the first 500 pages as an excuse for Walter to get a really good, guilt-free, lay from a much younger, dusky, stone temple dancer. Then came page 532. Way to wrap up the plot, cowboy.<br /><br />That I think is the big problem with the book. It's a comedy of manners that tries to turn serious and profound by throwing in some tragedy, and tries to transcend partisan politics with the really big picture. Democrats should lead and not make fun of the stupid people - the author is excused though, because he makes fun of everyone. Speaking of which, \\"War and Peace\\" references are comedy gold. Unless Franzen is serious, in which case they are comedy platinum.
B00AEUPOVQ|3.0|This was not bad, but boring in spots. Need to get by the first half hour to see any value to the movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You can do anything in this game except for making<br />a circle.It lets your creativity out.This game is definitely worth the 7.00 dollars<br />for those moms who don't want to buy it.
1781162646|4.0|I am a big King fan - which is probably why I finished this book in the 6 or so hours between the time it arrived on my doorstep to right now when I am writing this review.<br /><br />The character development was great, and that's what I love about his writing - HOWEVER without a lot of ghost story/paranormal stuff to spice it up it was mostly just about a college kids summer job. I liked the story - but it seemed like the whole crime part of it was just a sub-plot.<br /><br />Still decent though. I give it a solid B grade.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This film was a good adaptation of the novel...and the pace was also great. I enjoyed the film very much and as one of Jennifer's first films it was entertaining. I recommend it highly...but know its strictly PG-17 material dealt with openly and honestly.
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|Don't know what I am doing wrong, but when I point it away from me, I can't<br />see what I am capturing on the screen!

B008YU0AOE|5.0|I always needed a calculator for math class this one is the best one I could find and this one is the best their is.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|The movie is definitely creepy and everything was great up until you see the actual face of Mama. The CGI was so badly done that it became almost comical. The way that the CGI was incorporated to the real action was fine but the design of the face was pretty close to what you might see in an episode of Scooby Doo or a villain in a Disney movie.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Conceivably a real life story line, Denzel provides a stellar performance.<br />One of the best endings that I've seen in a long time.

B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|From the first to this installment I've enjoyed all of the Hobbit movies.<br />I probably like the earlier epic productions, although I did enjoy the humor in this edition.
B00821OX98|5.0|I love sci-fi. I love aliens. I love family dramas. This show has it all in one.<br /><br />I love that the battle with the aliens couldn't be wrapped up so neatly as has been done over and over in the movies. The battle came and we lost. These survivors are just trying to survive while the next battle waits. No cellphones, no email, no organized military effort. Just factions of folks who didn't used to shoot guns for a living trying to keep their family and friends alive, those that are left. Maybe even rescue a few of those POWs taken in the early days.
B001JIHGO0|4.0|Who doesn't like Hugh Jackman, well I'm sure there are a few.<br />This has good special effects, storyline and more provide you like this type of action and storyline.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I could jump on the bandwagon and complain about the changes to the original trilogy, but that's always seemed petty. They're functionally the same movies I fell in love with as a kid and they look great in blu ray. Having the opportunity to watch all six in sequence is also a treat as it offers some context to how things got where they are at the beginning of A New Hope. I would definitely recommend this collection.
B00COGY2P2|3.0|Not one I would have wanted to see at big screen prices..<br />Typical Tom Cruse, generally entertaining for this type of production..
B0000CABJ1|4.0|This lady hit the charts at the height of the &#34;DISCO DAYS&#34;.  I have danced the nights away to many of her songs!  Each of her albums was better than the last, she helped me to keep trim and my weight at a healthy size.<br />I have enjoyed getting reacquainted to her lovely voice and interjected music.<br />The music of my generation that brought many, but short lived nights of pure joy!!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Would recommend, good way to pass some time. Graphic`s are great just like all the games from Gameloft. If you like other Gameloft games, you'll like this.
B002HFP0QU|4.0|I enjoyed hearing there harmony and unusual sound again, but there were song that I was not acquainted  with and did not enjoy.
B004P12SSW|5.0|Cher was great, and she can sing. I loved the musical numbers.  Christina Aguilera was amazing too.<br />But it was that song that Cher sung, &#34;Last of Me.&#34; That made me go and buy the soundtrack to the movie.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Pixar never lets me down! Although not one of my favorite movies from Pixar (hard to compete with Toy Story and Finding Nemo), it is a great story and has a good message.
B0067R0APK|4.0|good info, days<br /> to use.  i would recommend it.  gives a choice of measurements, gives severe weather warnings too.<br />over all a good app.

1556438850|5.0|This is an excellent book not just for yogis thinking about teaching but also for any Yoga students that want a deep understanding of the history of Yoga, body physiology, and teaching techniques for asanas, pranayama, meditation, and class sequencing and structure.<br />The only recommendation I would suggest for a future print is to add the common names for the asanas on the description of the  Yoga poses, for the students like me that don't know all the Sanskrit names, and are forced to look at the appendix every time.<br /><br />I highly recommend this Yoga compendium to any Yoga practitioner that has the inclination for teaching.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like to run and get the coins. Like the turns and sliding down the vines. It is lots of fun jumping over rocks and other things.
030758836X|3.0|Gone Girl was highly recommended, I started it a few times and put it down, I finally got the audio and pushed through.  The book has many twist and turns you love and hate each character at different times in the book.  You're not wanting to put it down because you must find out how it ends. So it really keeps your interest and your very involved and then it ends - The ending was like the author got tired of it and decided OK this is it and just stopped. So here is my ending...and this is actually how I thought it would end.  One of the two authors him or her, writes this story while unemployed and it ends with the reader finding out it was JUST A STORY they wrote and included themselves. I think it would be a stellar ending!  At least it would have an ending.<br /><br />My niece read this on the plane and said she would have loved to throw it out the window!!!  I agree the ending needed to be launched into the atmosphere to never be thought of again.  The ending was so awful I will never read another book by this author.
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|I listened to this album over and over, people's negative reviews made me cautious, but I Loved it. That's what you love about Dave Mustaine. He reivents himself and yet stays in the Hard Rock era.
B00C2C637I|5.0|I could not put this book down. This was my first Bradbury read and I fell in love. Both the storyline and his writing style were hypnotic.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Me and my little brother love this game. He is autistic and has a hard time with coordination and motion on games but he loves this game and is really good at it too
B000683VI4|5.0|This is a really great DVD to which all of my family enjoyed, So nice to see true love play out over time, Also the price was great well worth the money, You will happy you got it I know I am
B00AEFXUL2|5.0|As with almost all John Wayne films, this a great western. Robert Mitchum is also very goo. in this movie
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|An excellent 3D movie. Many scenes where things just jump out of the tv. This movie is the reason to get a 3D tv.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|After waiting months for this book I was annoyed. I wanted to like it so much but it just didn't seem to go anywhere as none of the real issues were addressed. I hope the next book doesn't take 6 months to come out.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Great movie. Great 3D graphics. A classic movie. It was like watching it for the first time in 3D. I am happy we went with a 60 inch smart tv with 3D movies like this.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|So where is it all going??? Who knows but it's a hell of a ride that I hope doesn't end anytime soon.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Using my Kindle, I go on Facebook at least 2 or 3 times daily.  I like Facebook, with the news, Maxine's jokes, general information, and it's a great way to keep track of my friends and family. Would I recommend it? Absolutely.
B00CTXBO9M|4.0|I like it but it is not the best. I have encoundered epicness and glitches so I don't know which side to be on
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider is one of my favorite Solitaire games.  I play it on my computer as well as my Kindle Fire. It's really lot's of fun. Anyone who hasn't played the game, should, they're missing out on a fun game.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The Crossfire Series is a must read for any romance reader.  The love story is just as hot as the sex!
B00BEXB18M|4.0|I give this album a 8 every song was atleast solid sounded like dave was bringing his voice to a different level on some songs.
B009NY43NY|5.0|We will miss Sookie but Charlaine Harris does a great job tying things up. Truly an unbelievable, job creating a believable ending.
B0053JJLLC|1.0|I came across this one in my library's e-book lender and decided to go for it. It was honestly terrible. At 33% or so I wished it was over. I finished it because I have to finish all books I start, but it really was awful. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. The plot is loose, it's overly sciencey (like its trying to make up for the poor plot. I am bio major and love science), and just overall poorly written. Lots of redundancies. I hate to negatively review a book, but man, this sucked.
B00BY9GQHM|4.0|Point and Click/Hidden Object Games are my absolute favorite type of games to play on the Kindle Fire. That being said, I prefer the ones that mix puzzle solving, with point and click, with hidden object scenes. G5's best example of this is Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart; which I believe to be the best game that G5 has put out thus far. Letters from Nowhere is specifically made for the Hidden Object only fans. There is no puzzle solving or any point and click action requiring using items in an inventory to perform actions. If you prefer just hidden object scenes than this is for you. G5 is the best at placing objects into scenes so well that it is very challenging to find them all. A few are just downright impossible on a tablet screen, but overall the scenes are fantastic, visually appealing, and the story is nicely interweaved throughout. The music is also nicely done and never irritating. I sure do wish G5 would release the &#34;full&#34; versions of all of the games instead of this silliness where they try and bait you into the free versions hoping you will buy the full versions. I never clog my kindle up by downloading free versions and then removing it, only to leave internal content still on the machine. I have purchased all of G5's HOG full versions and will continue to do so when they are offered.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|BEST game ever besides minecraft you get to train your horse and even enter in compitions.It may take a long time to download but soooooooooo worth it
B009HUB40Y|4.0|great game to play at night when you cant sleep or stress out or in a Dr waiting room or for kids
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I have all the Kyuss, QOTSA, EODM, Vultures, Trees and Desert Sessions stuff and a bunch of other stuff Joshua Homme has had a hand in, and honestly I'm such a fan of his work I'm biased to say the least. Honestly though, I love this album! All the QOTSA albums are totally different and each has its own merits and I really love each and every one of them. This is a wonderful gift he has given us here. It's hard for anything to ever top Songs for the Deaf for me, but I'm not stuck in that era and neither is Josh. This album is killer from end to end. It's just so enjoyable to listen to. I don't have any high end equipment. I have listened to this on a variety of sources, currently an ALAC rip of the CD I purchased the day it came out on my 5th Gen iPod touch via unamped Sennheiser HD439 and this is a wonderful and affordable portable rig. It's revealing enough to hear all the little nuances this album has to offer. I'm not gonna go over all the songs in detail as ill leave that to better qualified folks. Ill just say its very very enjoyable. If your a QOTSA fan or just a fan of good rock music you won't be disappointed. I love Era Vulgaris but it was a bit of a grower for me aside from the opening track and 3s and 7s and Wanna Make It which I already had via desert sessions but it took a while for the rest to grow on me. BUT this new album I was on board from the first listen. Love the animated videos on YouTube as well. Check those out if you haven't.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was recommended to me.  I couldn't put it down!  The story had a wonderful flow, and the ending was a shock.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|This is a great book. It's not so philosophical as &#34;The Omnivorous Dilema&#34;, his book from 2006, the first one that made me read and think about how great this guy is, how easily he makes his points and how much research he does before writing something. Then came his also wonderful &#34;In defense of food: an eater's manifesto&#34;, in 2008, that made eating simple again. Now &#34;Cooked&#34; goes even further in making food and eating the center of an also very important thing we do: living.
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|Fogerty gives creedence to his past recordings by freshening them up and joining with his friends to do so.<br />Great stuff!!!!!
B009NY43NY|2.0|I was really disappointed in this book. For the last book in the series I was hoping for more. Something better. More of a wrap up. What started with a BANG ended horrible. That last couple books where no that great either but for a final book I wanted better
B005SEYOXW|5.0|I saw Serenity and liked it but knew I was missing a bunch. Then my friend started talking about Firefly and I gave it a shot. Now I want to interrogate everyone at Fox to learn who decided to cancel one of the best shows ever. 'Nuff said.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am going to disagree with all the negative reviews, because I felt that this book really looks like a real life story.  Last time I checked no one's life ends in three books.  So what, if there is going to be a book four or five.  Entwined with you was excellent.  It gives you a perspective of what life is like when you hide from things.  I love Eva even more in this book and I especially felt even closer to Cross.  Yes, there was alot of I love you, but hey what girl does not like to hear that phrase often.  Silvia Day, the book was real good and I look forward to book 4 and 5.  Hopefully your publishers will understand that there is no need to have to wait such a long time!!
B000FC146C|5.0|EXCELENT BOOK. i READ THIS BOOK 30 YEARS AGO AND NOW I AM FULLY ENJOYING IT. YOU HAVE AN EXCELENT OPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT THE LIFE OF AUSTRALIA IN DE EARLYS TWENTIES
1781162646|5.0|I loved this book! I'm of the generation that lived through this time. I have the next Stephen King's book on order and it should be here soon, yes!
B0036OODFU|5.0|I've never been to the seventies, but I like to imagine it was kind of like this! Best watched with a breeze flowing through your window and a bag of Fritos!
B006GKHE6G|5.0|Riptide GP is a great game! I play it on my Kindle Fire and I haven't had any issues with it. I can't put this game down.
B004N8CP8K|1.0|After my IT consultant downloaded this program from the Amazon site, he read a disclaimer that the program was not compatible with my Kindle Fire's Android system, so we do not use it.
B0028QCG7Y|5.0|I've read and re-read Gork Park over the last thirty odd years, and it remains a favorite. Witty and  penetrating, it is a fantastic thriller, an expose of Russian [ and American] society during the period of the Cold War, a history, and a love story with magical characters headed by the always soulful policeman Arkady Renko. This book transcends the thriller genre and has withstood the test of time. Also highly recommended is the second book in the series, Polar Star.
B007SGM084|4.0|was definately a different type of book i would normally read. but was turned towards due to popular recomendation and of course curiosity killed the cat and i took the plunge. i would recommend for a good read
B00CRW2066|5.0|I change my mind on my favorite song ever listen. Just a fantastic CD. These guys can do no wrong.
B006T5C5PS|5.0|I am convinced that the Gerson therapy and diet are what's missing in our education system and medical institutions, so there is a compelling sense that will lead anyone who reads this book to recommend it to all who one cares about. This is a very good starting point to make a change in our habits and the way we relate to each other as well as the environment.
B00BWGL6BS|5.0|Another fantastic compilation! The more I listen, the more I love it. &#34;Girl Who Got Away&#34; headlines strong lyrical<br />performances.
B003VIWO8Y|4.0|The book was amusing and easy to read, and for me as a Megadeth fan, I found it very informative and entertaining, no doubt I enjoy it very much; being said that, I really recommend any body who wants to know more on Mustaine and Megadeth to read this a most read!
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Great but could have been better plus I didnt like the treatment of Ewegene in the end. Great book either way.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I just found this series and fell in love with it!! Now I cant wait to watch the 2nd season!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Great game, one of only two I ever spent money on. But where is the latest update? I have this on my Android phone and Kindle fire. My Android updated weeks ago, but nothing yet for Kindle. I spent money on the Kindle app, I am starting to think Amazon owes me some money.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I would recommend this game to anyone. In it, you come up with different objects by typing them in. Many times you have to create helpful adjectives. It is definitely a brain game.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|A great movie. We love it. Have watched it many times. Finally Disney writes a movie where both parents are still alive.
B004UID2LC|2.0|You can only download trending or most viewed videos. There is no search, so for me, it is pretty much useless.
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|I love this CD best songs ever to listen to and not a bad price I didn't pay that much I highly recommend this product to people who like music
B008I3RARW|1.0|This is a stupid hard to play game. Hate it. It has extremely terrible graphics and interface. Do not waste your money.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is very enjoyable to watch because it takes you back in history to when the English Lords had  many servants to run their estates. They combine  the stories of the upper class with the lives of those servants.<br />Very interesting and well produced and directed, first class entertainment.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have a much different opinion from most of the other reviews I've read. I only started reading the Crossfire series about a month ago and read online prior to purchasing that is would be a 5 book series. I enjoyed this book and love the series as a whole. I'm guessing it will probably be awhile before book 4 is out, but I look forward to reading what's to come of Gideon and Eva. While I can understand why others have posted negative reviews, I just don't share the same grievances.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I can stay in contact with my family and friend from home oversea. It is a good tool for contact.
B0032CVAQQ|3.0|I think the idea and practice of this is wonderful.  I have read the first 5 Languages of Love book and this was the same book in a nutshell.  So I was a little disappointed.  I was hoping for new stories and more ideas not an editted version of the first book.  If you are interested in reading a shorter version, this works well.
B00AAQWMB4|3.0|I finally understand the game, it was difficult at first but it okay not one of my favorite but played.
0812973992|5.0|Got this book for my bookclub and I am really loving it.  The flow of characters and the contrast of 1974 to 2001 and the World Trade Center is intriguing.  Hard to put this book down.
B000U6BT40|4.0|I watched Eureka's first two seasons on SciFi before I lost satellite and all TV reception. It was fun to watch again. My favorite character is the 'mechanic', Henry.
B003Y74KAW|4.0|Very lightweight but so far it is doing its job.  I especially like the color which is truly a red.
B004TJ1H3C|4.0|The end was the end. Everybody dies. No one scientist should be the end all of progress. The writers blew it by trying to make Dr. Rush the scapegoat and source of all their problems. Eli can't do it alone. The other scientists were depicted as clueless, but they should have been the best of the best. Eli lacks both education and experience, and probably got everyone killed. Youth has enthusiasm, energy, and ideas, but age has wisdom, knowledge, and temperance. Also, in terms of genius, ten or twenty points of IQ means absolutely nothing. All those guys should have had IQs in the 150 to 190 range. (I expect the writers were somewhere close to 120.) Everyone has their own strong suits and weaknesses. This explains why the brilliant astrophysicist has no social skills. It was good it ended where it did; now we can all make up our own endings.<br /><br />I liked how the writers inserted a satisfactory alternate ending to the series.
B004SBULWE|2.0|The only changed I noticed after installing is that my battery drains a lot faster. Don't get, doesn't work well with kindle, made for Android.
B005544TRQ|4.0|It's got everything in it drama and comedy. Lewis just cracks me up.  It is good show to watch. Mike is very clever in what he does or just very lucky
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Not a trilogy?  There's gonna be another?  Nope.  This is the end for me and I was kinda done on trilogies to begin with.  However, the first crossfire novel was aces and the second was pretty good, so I thought this would be one of my exceptions.  At $9.99 for each, I expect more from my writers than to feel completely taken.  I expect more, than to read what was supposed to be the end of the story in three, only to find it isn't and I no longer like the characters I loved in one and two.  Not to be rude but, this is the last cash ill spend for this author.
0684847817|5.0|Brian Froud is an amazing illustrator with great insight into the worlds of the Tuatha De Nanann;  I have found a great many similarities in my personal experiences come to light when reading his descriptions.<br /><br />This book is well thought out and worth every penny - it is a joy to have and I highly recommend it to everyone with a love of our Faerie friends.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a fun app. It is cool because there are world tours. Hope you like it much as much as i did. Great for all ages.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|It was a very good read. Good story to help the reader question the legal system, but there were many unanswered questions and leads that never closed and ideas that never materialized. I guess you could interpret it as a parallel to a real life crime case but it was frustrating none the less! Worth the read, would recommend.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like the game. The only problem is that I am not getting the updates right when they come out.<br />Don't know if this is amazon ; and it seems to glitch alot at times. Other than that the is game is fun if you like running games
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was so happy to wake up yesterday and see this delivered to my Kindle...like Christmas morning happy!  That happiness continued throughout the entire book, and then to find out that the story will continue??  I was over the moon!<br /><br />I don't understand all the people upset that the story will be continued!  Personally, I always wish great stories like this would keep going.  How many times have I wondered how Anna and Christian are doing and what they are up too?  Or Edward and Bella?  The list could go on and on and I am thrilled Sylvia decided to let us see more, I hope the rumors are true that there will be not just a 4th, but a 5th book as well.<br /><br />Happy reading!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|One of the best Bond films in recent memory. Packed with action and a great story line. A must see for any Bond fan!
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Very good,  Jeffrey left his readers hanging so I am waiting for the next installment, Jeffrey Archer is a wonderful Author. I have read all of his books.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|There were 5 story lines, and their connection did not begin to be apparent until the film was half way through (a good 1hr15min in).  I would not watch it again or recommend it.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|This season of Next Gen looks and sounds great! It's great that CBS is putting so much love into these Hi Def releases!
B0094K1WZE|1.0|The movie itself was probably 3 to 3.5 stars but the streaming experience through Amazon was horrible.  Things were going well when all of a sudden the movie was interrupted for more downloading.  The movie would continue for a few seconds and then stop for downloading again.  We eventually had to switch to Netflix for a better, uninterrupted streaming experience.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|As a longtime Sherlock Holmes fan, I find this particular version a great deal of fun.<br />The tension within the male/female Sherlock/Watson casting decision is a new twist that works well within a frame of smartly-written mystery.<br />The production is a well-acted, keenly orchestrated frolicking romp.<br />I'm certifiably hooked.
B000WD66BM|5.0|Just so happy to finally get this item I have been waiting awhile for it and I like the CD so much.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|As always Sylvia never disappoints with her amazing skills as a writer. Talk about the \\"details\\" ...YES! Hot, Hot, Hot. I love Eva and Gideon, they're relationship just keeps getting better and stronger. This is the third book in the\\"Crossfire Series\\", so if you are contemplating reading buying it, just make sure you start with \\"Bared To You\\". All three of these books deserve five stars! I only had five words to say after the last page, \\"Are you s***ting me!\\"
B00005J6T1|5.0|I like the service and the CD is in great shape I am very pleased with the item and like it alot.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Most entertaining series I've seen this year!! My husband who is all national news and golf watches the videos with me and looks forward to our \\"British Show\\" almost as eagerly as I do! I hope this will be a long running series .
0307943232|5.0|We listened to this book on audio tape and the narrator did a great job. He was able to define each character with a different voice, accent and tone. There were many twists to the story and a very surprising ending.  I would highly recommend this book.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|Great film adaption of a classic comic series. I highly recommend it, Robert Downey Jr plays the rich  corporate head, womanizer billionaire  perfectly.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I couldn't wait for this one to come out and was so sad it only took me a day and a half to read! LOL Lot's of great things happening in the story and I'm so sad ill have to wait months for book four!
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|Touching story ... Wonderfully acted ... Visually stunning ... Cinematography and art direction at its best ... The Fall is in my personal Top 5 list
B0091REZMW|5.0|I think this game is fun but could be better. I think the cost for diamonds is way to high.
B005BZQVF2|2.0|Just finished watching this and came close to just stopping the video several times.  While I love everything else these two have done, and Jason Bateman was great, the movie just couldn't seem to get past the adolescent potty humor stage. I am mostly disappointed because it could have been so much better...wish I hadn't wasted my time and money.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Harold Fry is an ordinary man who decides to do an extraordinary thing: save his friend Queenie from dying of cancer by walking to her bedside. The characters he meets along the way, the introspection he develops about himself, and the renewed relationship with his wife are not to be missed.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Great movie for expectant parents and non-expectant parents.  Even if you're not thinking about having a baby, this movie was funny.  It didnt get boring like I thought it would.  With great actresses how could it?? Loved it!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|every night we use this app to help us sleep.  it will put my baby to sleep in just minutes!
B000LXQVA4|1.0|As a new parent I did not really understand what to look for in toys for my baby. I purchased this based on the reviews but have been very disappointing with this product. I would not buy this jumperoo again, in fact, I wish I had bought a different one. As other reviews have stated, it's too tall for a younger baby. Also, the toys are kind of boring and not really very usable. My baby likes the jumping but the toys aren't very engaging. Like others have posted the tiger with the rainbow barely pops up so it's not engaging. The \\"bug\\" does not stand up as in the picture however, my baby like to chew on it. The spinning lizard with beads is okay but she only plays with that for a min. or so. The music is cute but there's not too much variety and the other \\"toys\\" on that bar are a disaster. The elephant is facing the wrong way and is extremely hard for even me to turn. The other hanging toys don't really swing very well. The hanging plush toys above are unreachable. What are they even supposed to do? The overall structure seems stable but not as much as I would like. Overall the jumperoo seems cheap for how expensive it is.<br />TL;DR Seems cheap for the money, toys aren't fun, buy a different one!
B00CRS5HII|4.0|Husband wanted album, I was surprised at his range.  Probably will purchase more of Darius Rucker.  Liked him since he was with Hootie and the Blowfish just didn't realize it was the same guy until recently.
B000RZIGSG|5.0|Although the end of movie was predictable, I still loved the music, fashion and dancing and I loved the soundtrack.
B00AFEX83C|5.0|This is an awesome movie for both adults and kids. I bought it for my 31/2 year old grandson and he enjoys watching it over and over.
B00AH8U3UC|4.0|Likable, law-breaking, annoying, lucky, addicted, charming, despicable. The writing is clever although the plot could use a a new direction.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Loved this game!  I just wish these games took a much longer time to complete.  I finished this game in just two days.  Please make these graphically beautiful games longer with several chapters.  Maybe a more complicated story with several plots that are connected and at the end, a big surprise finale.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|So far he had it wrong once out of 8 times. He could not get Lenny from Memento. But he got everything else! Even from Japanese animes! How? SPOOKY!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|As I said before, I like all Mahjong games, they are good for the mind, and besides I'm a gamer
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Intelligent fun is exemplified in the scripts and the actors make them work. The subplots are quirky and keep you wondering what is happening next to these people
B006M4F67A|5.0|Same as all the rest of stuff I said about the Mahjong games that I just reviewed, should really put the same games<br />in on lump sum
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|It was just great! The imagery was just breathtaking and what a great story.  A must see for movie lovers.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a fun to play to pass the time and see who can get the highest score out of your friends
B0052UZIFA|5.0|We have a blast playing the game! The zombies are  very creative  with  crazy surprises, the plants are also great fun.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this is by far one of the funest games I have played in a really long time. mostly because you cant just run through the game. most of the fun is getting on and making new friends and keeping in touch with old ones. also the more you play the more things you figure out its like you learn something new all the time.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|I've had this watch for 7 or 8 months now and it is a great watch. I loved the look and it's my first automatic. It keeps OK time. Mine ends up losing a couple minutes every month. Not a big deal, because I end up having to reset it at least once a month anyway since I don't wear it hiking or climbing. However, I read some reviews of this watch running fast. I guess it depends on the piece, which is kind of cool because it makes each one unique. I wear it every day, with the exception of some weekends. I don't wear it when I hike (I wear a digital watch for that) and when I come back from a weekend away, it usually needs winding, but it starts back up again quick. Usually it will run for a day or two without winding.<br /><br />Bottom line: Fun, cheap automatic for watch lovers but DO NOT buy if you want something rugged, versatile, or extremely accurate.<br /><br />I also wanted to mention that a couple months after purchasing this watch, I found the same watch in Boscovs for $180 marked down to $99! Amazon has the best price I've seen!
B001DF68MA|5.0|She fits comfortably in the seat and enjoys being in the front of the bike to see the adventures ahead of us.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|I have only been listening to Joe B. foe approx 9 months, but he is amazing, I have even seen him in concert  this cd is worth war ever you ay for it,
B000XKZQ74|5.0|Fascinating , on many levels . Excellent source<br />of history , and unfortunately still present realities.<br />Acting superb. The director along with the writing of the story knocked it way out of the park! Through out artistic excellence .
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|It was totally awesome. There is nothing bad to say about this movie. Love these kind of movies and it didnt disappoint
B009KS4XRO|3.0|The new look as they call it for the power ups is awful. Now you use 1000 coins for 4 power ups instead of the original 9. This update needs to go. Other than that I love the game. Fun, time consuming and entertaining.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|Arnold never loses his charm. I loved his acting in this movie. Keep them coming you can miss with him in them
B003YL4KS0|5.0|Finally something that makes sense out of my curly hair. I thought I was doomed to frizz and fuzz but now I have the tools and knowledge to enjoy my curly girl hair. Thank you.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie made me feel for all who suffered from this tragedy. It was just realistic enough to make you feel like you were there.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|I have read all of these books in the series, but this one I  my least favorite. First of, The character steals. Is this pointing out that it is OK to steal. He also does a lot of disobedient acts which I clearly find a bad influence.<br />He also treats his friends poorly, and doesn't care about his inner character, but what his reputation is and his clothes. This book is gesturing bad behavior like stealing or lying to get what you want. I don't recommend this book. Even for the exceptional price.<br />I don't know where Jeff Kinney was aiming for, but he clearly didn't think about his character so he is saying it is \\"cool\\" to do these various actions. He really didn't think about the actions effected from his hideous cold-hearted character. He did terrible on the plot and character set up. The character never did get punished and learn from his mistakes, making Kinney a so far, bad authority to good citizenship. I really don't recommend this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very addicting.. once I began to play it I honestly couldn't stop it kept me very busy for hours. The hours seemed to fly by.. my six year old loves this game too.. it's even easy for him to play.
1476734941|5.0|Excellent, very informative and such an easy diet to follow, so there are  no excuses to fail really. The book is very friendly to read and so entertaining too.<br />I am so happy to have the chance to know about it and been able to get it, I would highly recommended to anyone who wants to loose weight without going through excruciating diets.
B000JMKOI2|1.0|Very poor a story of a drunk going through his pathetic life being a drunk who can not hold a job
B005KITK6C|5.0|My grandson was sooo happy with his gift! I excitedly told me all about the character and how everything worked--TOTALLY OVER MY HEAD.  When grandchildren are happy, I'm happy!  Thanks!!
B000SEI230|5.0|This is such a great love story and a truly very inspiring one.  At the same time,  it has it's sad parts.  It has every sentiment you may want in a good book.  I loved it.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I liked this app until I discovered that it cannot be set to store downloaded mp3's to the SD card. This essentially renders the application useless for its advertised purpose. Unfortunately I already subscribed for a year of the premium service. Lesson learned. I hope this review will spare you from making the same mistake.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I always told my friend that this gamed sucked. I tried it out and I ended up loving it. Can't stop playing!!!
0307010856|5.0|I had this book as a child, and it still makes me laugh and smile.  It's a timeless book, perfect for anyone who ever watched and enjoyed Sesame Street!  I've been giving this book to every friend and family member who is expecting a baby this year!
B003VANOFY|5.0|I've really been enjoying these headphones. They fit my head nicely, the sound quality is good (for what I do with them anyway).<br /><br />Some cons: I like having one headphone off my ear, just as a personal thing so I can hear what people are saying (you can hear virtually nothing with these on). The way the headphones are designed (with the main part being able to twist 90 degrees) makes this fairly difficult, and I usually have one sitting half on and half off my ear.<br /><br />They're fairly heavy, and the head strap needs to be positioned just so so that they don't end up sliding off my head.<br /><br />Finally, I feel like the microphone sits really low when it's fully engaged. However, nobody has complained about the sound quality of it so I suppose it's not that bad.<br /><br />All in all, these were an excellent purchase for their amount. The issues I stated aren't even bothersome enough to remove a star over, just letting people know.
B00CMKDMM4|3.0|Many of the tricks you can do on Kindle are not available on an Android tablet or iPad, making it rather cumbersome to use it as anything as a book you read from start to end.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is addicting works really well on my kindle! i took my tablet to my last softball game and while we were waiting to drive up with the team i let my team members look through my apps... one of the girls found leps world and started playing.. when another girl on the team took it away from her she started playing too...
0307730697|5.0|This story of life lost and found to become the best of the best is a great reminder to never give up on anyone!  Even if you don't believe in the power of God to transform lives, you'll love this non-preachy account of Adam Brown's incredible life.  It is a great read for all ages in all phases of life.  Learning what it took for Brown to accomplish what he did will amaze and inspire.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Great book!! I loved this book it's fun with great twists that make you not  want to put it down.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Great film and great acting by the entire cast.  I really recommend this film for the unique story line and fantastic performances.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book made it impossible for me to put down. I felt so emotionally involved that I lost track of time. There were times when I felt like crying. This book is amazing and I highly recommend reading it.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Loved this movie. Even my guy friend who is a dude's dude, loved this movie. Don't be afraid of the musical!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|As usual John Green makes you think… but not quite hard enough to cause discomfort to his average reader. This isn't Hamlet, but it is a wonderful way to pass an hour.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Have been a fan of John Fogerty since Creedence.  He never disappoints with each release.  Nice to hear different arrangements of some of his greatest music.  I have really enjoyed this selection of music, and I imagine any fan of JF will enjoy it as well.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|The very best entertainment for children and for their grandparents.  We love watching it together.  It sets the gold standard.
B00CM96A60|5.0|Grabbed me with the first track and stayed intense all the way to the end. A must for any Armin fan.
B005544V6A|5.0|One of my favorite shows. I can watch this series over and over. Hope it sticks around. Lots of fun.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Great film!  A little long, but it all had to be told, so well worth it. Jessica Chastain did an amazing job.
B00CW665VI|5.0|A WOW BOOK!!! I Read a lot an I mean a lot...(insomnia)  This book had me laughing uncontrollably at 1 am to the extent I wake my husband up, I just couldn't stop giggling.  This book is creative, refreshing, and hilarious.  I loved it was from the guys perspective it totally changed up the story an made it so much more interesting than the normal romantic comedy.  I would recommend it to any of my friends and am 100% sure they would LOVE IT TOO!!!
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|This is just a lament on the Lack of a 2D version included in the package. I have to vote with my $ and despite the fact that I want to see the movie, I will not buy it out of principal. Sorry Disney, but I hope you lose enough sales that you wont try this again.
B003G8Y4QO|4.0|I really liked David Tennant's version of the Doctor, so a big part of Season 5 was getting used to Matt Smith as the newest incarnation of the Doctor. In the end he won me over, thanks also to the companion character of Amy, who is easy on the eyes but also shows a good amount of Scots spunkiness. Smith plays the Doctor in a more childlike way than Tennant, and indeed the whole new season seems slightly more YA-oriented than seasons past.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Although there were a few droll clever humorous bits, the main flaw in this work is that you don't like any of the characters, nor do you care what happens to them after the first 40 pages. In order to write a biting social commentary, a writer must first make us care about something or someone, and that doesn't happen here. I stopped after the first 50 pages, skipped through and read the final few pages. Unfortunately it ends as dismally as it starts. Perhaps her muse fled after Harry. Too bad she didn't stop with Harry because that series was brilliant, and she needn't have written anything else to have been remembered as a light in literature. For real insight into contemporary Britain, read the Adrian Mole series. It isn't really for kids...[[ASIN:0060533994 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 3/4]] For a much better story than Casual Vacancy based on life in a small British town and political infighting therein - read John Mortimer's two excellent novels: [[ASIN:014009864X Paradise Postponed]] and its sequel [[ASIN:B009O3G7EW Titmuss Regained by John Mortimer published by Penguin (1990) [Paperback]]]
B003OFVIXG|5.0|I'm trying to learn French so I bought some French music to help with hearing the lanaguage as it is really used.  However, this album is very enjoyable even if you don' t understand the language.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|It's fine. I'd like it to stop asking me to rate it every 5 minutes or so. Good colors, pretty easy to navigate.

1781162646|5.0|Once upon a time, Stephen King could tell a good story.  The Body (which was made into the excellent movie Stand By Me) was an outstanding example of this; so was Carrie, although it was epistolary; and so was The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon.  Then, maybe starting with Insomnia, he got just too long-winded for me, like a beauty queen who put on 150 pounds.  I could not make it through Under the Dome, and I only read the first few books of The Dark Tower.  This, however, takes me back to The Body and Tom Gordon.  It's a story--a fascinating story--about a young man who loses the girl he loves and spends the summer of 1973 working at an amusement park which reminded me of a park from my youth, Idlewild Park in Ligonier, PA.  The park may have a resident ghost, a young woman who was murdered in the funhouse.  Some people have seen her, although most have not.<br /><br />Devin Jones, the protagonist, is a 21-year-old student at the University of New Hampshire who aspires to be a writer; he reminds me very much of the narrator of The Body grown a little older. His two friends and housemates in his summer boardinghouse are an art student from Bard, Erin Cook, and a Rutgers student named Tom Kennedy; they will be his friends for life.  A woman lives in a large beach house that he passes by every day on his way to and from Joyland; she has a wheelchair-bound son Mike, who is very reminiscent of The Shining's Danny Torrance.<br /><br />As the summer progresses, Devin wants to know more about the ghost and about her unsolved murder.  One of them does see the ghost, but the other two do not.  When summer ends, Devin asks to stay on at the park because of his fascination with the ghost and with Mike and his mother.  It may be one of the best decisions he has ever made.<br /><br />There is an Easter egg for readers of fantastic fiction.  A carnival, which appeared in two towns before unsolved murders exactly this one, is called Manly Wellman's Show of 1000 Wonders; Manly Wade Wellman was the author of some wonderful stories about John the Balladeer, the most famous of which may have been Vandy, Vandy.  I love his works.<br /><br />One very minor criticism is that it is told by Devin in 2013, 40 years after the events of the book; it's good in the sense that we know what will happen to him, but, of course, it means that he will come out of this alive, so it does cut down the suspense a little.<br /><br />Again, this is the Stephen King I know and love.  I'm glad I bought this book, which I couldn't put down until I came to the end.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I found that Arrow grabbed me immediately. Loved the premis, liked a little of the &#34;Lost Style', actors were perfect, This is very fine &#34;entertainment&#34; Also if you like Katie Cassidy, this is for you!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|It's Castle...  what more do you need to know?  Good acting, good photography and good story lines.  Can't wait for the next season!
B004X4R49Y|5.0|We loved it here.  What an acting job by Colin Firth!  The Oscar was well deserved.  And Geoffrey Rush was wonderful - as he always is.  Helen Bonham Carter was a lovely queen also.  All around splendid!
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Good movie! Funny and heartfelt with a star packed cast. Fat Patricia is in it which means you have to watch it.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is a little gem of a film.  Great cast/good story lines/somewhat novel setting.  The realism and humanity of the story and characters shine through.
B000FC12Z0|5.0|We are planning on staying at the hotel in Istanbul, Turkey where this book was written. It was the hotel where passengers stayed who were traveling on the Orient Express... Hemingway et all. The Pera Palace Hotel.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|This was a very good movie. You really Have to watch uninterrupted.<br />I just remembered why I don't do reviews!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have played minecraft on the computer before but this is so cool. When will the new update come out. I've been waiting for a month and it hasn't come out. So if you guys know when it will come out and tell me about it that would be great.
B00BI6SSMC|5.0|I have previous recordings but this so far is my favorite.  I love Samuel Beam's song writing and the recording's end result.<br />Its one of the few recordings I've bought recently that I immediately wanted to listen to again.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|No other Chef has come close to the honesty of the restaurant business as  Anthony Bourdain - this book is one of the best if not the best - if you're wanting to know how it really is this is the book to read. And if you love to cook - read this book!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It makes it easy to download books. I especially like it when traveling. It was easy to download and I could it immediately.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|If you're looking for an app to use through prayer, meditation or sleep, this should fit the bill.  A huge supply of sound effects and relaxing music.
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|This was pretty stupid. I found it barely watchable. The only thing that kept me going was the hope hat it would get better. It did not. Don't waste your time.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|What a great book! Such a moving story and its so sad to read what happens to orphans after they turn 18.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Warm Bodies is a  poignant and moving little gem of a movie. The acting is solid and the lead zombie's yearnings and confusions (he is aptly played by Nicholas Hoult) are convincing. Trivia buffs might be interested in knowing that Hoult also starred as young Marcus in About a Boy.<br /><br />There are many small moments of humor in this film, nicely inserted into the flow of events. There is also a cute scene that gives a nod to Romeo and Juliet. One caution: the zombie voices don't always result in clearly audible speech but that didn't happen often enough to irritate us. If you need to understand every word in a film, however, that isn't likely.<br /><br />The basic set-up: after an apocalyptic event, the world is left populated with zombies and humans, with the humans (led by the always watchable John Malkovich) determined to kill the zombies. The \\"kill the zombies\\" theme isn't anything new in the zombie genre so thankfully there is an added twist. I won't give spoilers about that although this site's photo doesn't leave much to the imagination about that. Even so, not every event is wholly predictable.<br /><br />I was particularly entranced by the actors in the film. Viewers may see parallels between zombie behavior and growing alienation, loss of identity, and lack of community in our society - and those parallels definitely increased my enjoyment of what might otherwise have been only a mildly diverting film.<br /><br />What may make or break this movie for viewers is the resonance of the zombie/human interactions. I never lost interest in those- or in any of the lead or minor characters. The plot also moved along at a decent pace and held my attention from beginning to end. I'd gladly watch it again.
B008L1DNGI|3.0|It's more of a nostalgia thing that it is a &#34;must have hit game&#34;. My kids like it and I play it every once in a while.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|A free book is a great way to get to know an author. If I like their books, I will certainly want to buy future publications.
B00COGY2P2|1.0|They weren't -- this movie is lousy! The only good part was the appearance of Robert Duvall.  Tom Cruise smirks his way through this movie which got really annoying.<br />I don't understand why he keeps getting parts that would be better played by younger, better men. Oh well.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|My daughter who is one loves the singing and bright colors. I love it too and think it will be a loved movie for a long time.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|I loved this book!  It took some getting use to but I thought it was amazing! Very well written! I recommend it!
0345529057|4.0|The bundle is great for the price, but the pages are small and hard to hold. With each book in the series over 1,000 pages, its hard to open the pages toward the center of the books without over extending the spine.
B008D37SGU|5.0|I only bought this to see Tom Hiddleston. As usual, he was brilliant. Such a departure from his usual roles. Rachel Weisz is adorable as always. A great film, a little heavy, but nonetheless it was wonderful.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|If you are having problems on your bike with a standard handlebar and mounting a GPS or phone, this is the answer. I installed this on my 2009 BMW F650GS and can easily take my GPS off when traveling and stopped. It comes with two sets of screws so it can be installed of different diameters. An excellent product as all RAM Mounts are.
B002KKCVWI|5.0|Very comfortable footbed and straps. They feel surefooted and I am confident on rocks, decks, in the water etc<br />I think they are more comfortable than the Hurricanes I had before<br /><br />I would buy again but wish they didn't have such a large teva logo
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|I bought this movie for my grandchildren.  They squealed with delight. The movie is everything I remember from my own childhood and more!  Captain Hook and the croc brought lots of giggles.
0446615625|5.0|The Camel Club members are each so unique and interesting.  The characters in the book are so good.  The involved mysteries and story made it a great page turner.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I have used both the Blu-Ray and digital copy that this version of the movie allowed. Both worked great. I have not tried the DVD. The movie itself has a great story! Although very racially charged (I mean it is slavery). Definitely a good movie to watch, definitely NOT a good movie to watch as a family.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Completely developed believable characters set in an epic fantasy landscape. Story line is unpredictable. Fast paced and engrossing. I've barely put it down!
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|the graphics are beautiful and it's easy to play.  very User friendly; even my grandkids can play it! I like the battles.
B008MM9630|5.0|This is a neat game.  Graphic`s are very clear.  I have this app on my Kindle Fire and my tablet.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game. I also like that you had it in Tokyo and then changed it to Miami. I think it would be a good idea to change it to Paris sometime. Sincerely- Nea Arave and Blake Rylie
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The was an awesome continuing story of Eva and Gideon! Their relationship faces so many obstacles in this book. Gideon will do anything to keep Eva safe and make her happy. What a man!! I love him and can't wait for their next journey... This book leaves a lot of different stories open to be finished. I hope their love will hold strong!!
B000OLRH10|4.0|I liked this movie. There was a pretty good plot line to the move. I was originally interested because of Leonardo Dicaprio, and he met my expectations for this movie. His performance was not as good as in his more recent movies like Inception and Shutter Island, but his South African accent was very good. This movie is clearly supposed to leave the viewer thinking about what the real price of our Diamonds are. While the movie did a decent job depicting why blood diamonds are so terrible, I can't say I particularly liked feeling it forced upon me while watching the film.
1878424319|5.0|I truly enjoyed it and I've recommended it to others.  It  is something that I will read and study over and over.
1451695195|5.0|An amazingly interesting book told from the perspective of a neurosurgeon and his journey into the afterlife during his illness with bacterial meningitis.  The fact that he tells this story guilelessly is refreshing, knowing that many of today's medical practioners do not believe in something that can occur without their intervention.
B0034G4OUO|5.0|Great writing and some of the Rock's best acting- IMO.  It is a little intense in places so wouldn't recommend it for the faint of heart.  It has the feel of the old Charles Bronson movie 'Deathwish'.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|This show is great.  I have seen it 3 times already and I'm very happy I can listen to it at home now.  The CD sound is very well done and true to the current cast and production.  Billy Porter and Stark Sands are excellent, go see them if you can.  I am also very impressed with Cyndi Lauper, she is mighty talented, well done!
B008JJM88Q|1.0|The software is great with the way it works but the font is a little small and nearly impossible to read when it against a black background.
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|The Impossible - This movie is about the Christmas Day Tsunami in Indonesia and nearby countries. It centers on one family and how they miraculously survived and were reunited, unlike so many other 10,000's of people. The movie is worth watching and celebrating with that family for their survival, but it is heart wrenching to better understand the losses for so many others.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have this on my Kindle Fire HD for my grandson who is 7 and he plays it all the time!  Love having it for him to enjoy!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I will preface by saying I am an avid Game of Thrones fan. I have read all the books, several author interviews, etc. That said, to me the books are dogma. The show does a pretty good job of bringing this to life. However there are times when the show goes on its own path. Season 2 had a lot of that. Several meaningful plot lines were completely rewritten in comparison to the book giving the series a different feel. Not for the better and not necessarily for the worse. The hard part as George R.R. Martin said in an interview a few months back is going to be how is the TV show going to write back in or around some characters they killed off in Season 2 when they should show up extensively in Season  4 and onward. The special features should not leave anyone disappointed.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I really like this version of Mahjong.  The colors are easy to see and it is a nice, fast game to play.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Tarantino continues his creative genius in a new genre. A must see for any Tarantino fan! Jamie Foxx is awesome!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I have it set to most recent for homepage, but it gives me posts that r like 4 days old and it piles up on posts for the same 4 people  I don't even have it set in a group or anything!! Ugh it's frustrating!! And you can't edit events on here or set your cover picture
B002WV5A9G|5.0|This Star Trek is fresh and new with enough throw-away lines to remind us of the original Star Trek without hitting us over the head. Refreshing. Well cast. A delight to watch. I'd recommend it to anyone who is into the genre.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|I bought several seasons of NCIS for my daughter for her birthday.  Our whole family loves this series!  She was excited to get them!!  Can't wait to watch them again!
B001F3FUK6|5.0|When this movie was made they basically pretended that Superman 3 & 4 were never made. Picking up post Superman 2 for the reboot seemed like a good idea at the time. It is an enjoyable movie. Brandon Routh really seems to try at the role of Superman. However it comes off a lot like a divorced couple sitcom in many ways; at least in my opinion. I would rate the movie a 4 but the special features I would rate well beyond a 5 (a 10 if possible). For fans of special features this is a choice purchase.
B00A3XQVKW|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. Betty's experience was wonderful to read and I found many parts of story to be very emotional. The thought of my spirit sharing a new world with angels & our creator gave me a wonderful perspective of how life may be after passing. I held a wonderful sense of difference in my life after reading Embraced By The light, I enjoyed it very much.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Sad he couldn't make it, It is clear how perfectionist he was and the music knowledge is always fascinating. Sad the way he transformed his face,
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|It's over before you are ready to stop playing. Beautifully designed and a pleasure to play  I will watch for more from this company
B007SGM084|5.0|I heard about the book through Facebook but never was interested I guess. When I started reading, the book seemed boring. I stopped reading it for a like 2 months but I just hate not finishing a book unless it's truly dull. So I pressed through the book & it finally got interesting. I really wasn't interested into the whole BDSM parts of the book. I like who the characters evolved in the story.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have this on my Kindle Fire HD for my grandson who is 7 and he plays it all the time!  Love having it for him to enjoy!
B000OVLBFS|5.0|I purchase this as a gift.  Tom Selleck plays Jesse Stone very well.  He is a great actor and the movie keeps your interest.  I love all his movies. I would recommend for anyone to watch this movie.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|Movie was ok, but the bad language just did not stop. I was very disappointed. I don't have any more words.
0307716988|5.0|I enjoyed reading it, Michael is very good on describing his feelings both when he was a kid star and after as a mature artist. I consider Michael a musician as Mozart- Good pictures, he was talent as draftsman too
B009A87ZQU|5.0|I.Background: Casino Royale was directed by Martin Campbell and got $599 million in the box office making it the highest grossing James Bond movie on its release. However, Skyfall took its place 6 years later. It was based off a book by Ian Fleming also called Casino Royale. Though it was made by MGM, they did not have the rights to Casino Royale until 2000. Until then it was owned only by Colombia. The idea of Casino Royale was pitched alongside an unmade movie called Jinx based entirely on a character in Die Another Day.<br /><br />II.Setting: Montenegro; Present Day<br />Characters: James Bond<br />Le Chiffre<br />M<br />Mr. White<br />Vesper Lynd<br /><br />III.Plot: After M promotes Bond to 00 status, he uncovers an attack planned by Le Chiffre, a private banker for terrorists to blow up a new plane prototype after selling the terrorist's stocks of the business making the plane. When Bond stops the bombing, Le Chiffre losses a large amount of their money. He enters the last of their money in a high stakes poker game at a casino in Montenegro. Bond is sent in to take the last of his money on the game. Along the way he is betrayed. Le Chiffre is killed by Mr. White after he torchers James. Bond wakes up in a hospital, all is right with the world. He resigns from MI6 to be with Vesper a woman he met on his adventure. She transfers the funds of the national treasury to the bank of Mr. White and is drowned. Mr. White is shot in the leg by Bond, who shoots him in the head after saying his famous phrase \\"The name's Bond, James Bond.\\"<br /><br />IV.Theme: Don't trust anyone
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I like this app well enough but would prefer if a link would open to a new tab. Trying to get back to fb after going to a link can mean hitting the back button a dozen times. Apart from that issue I think the app works well.<br />I do like that it is full version and works just the same as on a computer.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was excellent!  I couldn't put it down.  I purchased the first one on my Kindle and then borrowed the second one from Amazon on my Kindle.  I'm currently reading the 3rd one on my Kindle.  Very good series!
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|After all Schwarzenegger has been through, I was wondering if he would flop as bad as Fallon did after Fallon tried his hand at a\\"Movie Career\\". But actor Arnold Schwarzenegger turned political and back to actor again shows his true grit in his ability to hold on and entertain audiences once more.<br />What I liked best was the flow of the action as it built up from a just another hometown movie to Arnolds full blown action movies we have all grown to love;Even though I feel it may be a bit old he still manages to keep to his theme of saying famous short statements such as \\"I'll be back\\" and \\"Get to the chopper\\". I would say it is a good movie to rent,maybe even add to your collect at some point if you are an Arnold fan.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|This is such a good show ............now I have the music!  I love the fact the music is original not something that was lifted from other sources.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This film is a wonderful, warm and funny film.  Very inspiring and heartfelt.  I highly recommend it, not just to see but to own.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|A few funny moments. But, yet again, another Hollywood production trying to depict the 'normal' American family dealing with normal problems. Not. Maybe this is a normal American family if you are living in the heart of upperclass So. Cal. and have ties to the music/movie industry. More importantly, the thing about this movie that really sunk the star count was Leslie Mann. She is remarkably annoying. At first it was her whiny cutesy voice, but as the movie progressed, it definitely was her acting. She is simply just not that good or funny and should stick to behind the scenes with her husband...perhaps her talents would be better used there.
1446301583|4.0|I found it very confusing to have so many patterns on top of each other.  Also the patterns that should be joined together before cutting them out should have notations on them or at least a notation in the directions.  The pictures don't give an advance warning as to what to do.  I ended up having a seam in the middle of me coveralls at the knee.  I am really upset about this and will have to figure out how to cover up my mistake.  A real bummer for me.  Also how do you get the doll to sit up?  Mine keeps flopping back :-(.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|One of my favorite smartphone/tablet games of all time.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes to play mobile games.  I cannot wait for the sequel.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Having read the books, the show feels more like a synopsis than anything; but that said, the acting is pretty good and the sets are really good as well; a nice companion to the books
B002L7TMAE|5.0|I have the double CD, the Vogue Years, but it doesn't compare to the quality of these recordings nor does it include many songs that it should've included (such as Ca a rat&eacute;). Each CD comes in its own jacket with the artwork from the original LP and each CD is designed to look like a vinyl record. The set also includes a booklet, in French, describing each album as well as listing the songs in the back. Along with this collection and the Vogue Years, I also have Les Chansons D'Amour (and also All Over the World); I've downloaded all the CDs to my PC, which enables me to compare the quality from the songs that are on each CD (on Bose speakers), and this boxed set is without a doubt the best quality. Though I wouldn't discourage anyone from purchasing the other CDs, if you're going to invest the money, this is the one to go with. I'm not sure how anyone could find her voice insipid; admittedly, she seems not as sure about some songs (or, perhaps, wasn't as excited about recording them, who knows), but overall, she has a great voice and the songs are well arranged and engineered so that 50 years later (or thereabouts), they sound exceptional and are infectious. If you're a Hardy fan, it's a must have; if you're just discovering her, this is the best way to start!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Dear writer:  If your story thread is so long to require a sequel, have the decency to have the next installment published in the following month.  If your story is so long you can't complete it in three books, you might need to do some editing. By the time this segment came out, I forgot half the prior stories.<br /><br />I received notice of three more pieces coming from Syvlia Day--all in the future. Knowing how the publication date on this was pushed back a few times, can't say I'll be holding my breath.  Send me a line when all the sequels are out in a package deal, and then I might bite.<br /><br />Day writes good characters, but the way she allows publishers to drag out publication dates is annoying.  I'm searching for a new author for that reason alone.<br /><br />For fantasy, it's a good read and doesn't have the strong BSDM theme of Fifty Shades of Grey.  Like the eroticism, but believe other authors won't continue to string me along awaiting the next installment--or at least deliver on their promised publication dates.
B009JBZH54|5.0|It's a must buy for anyone who loves the dark knight trilogy. Add it to your collection best telling of batman yet.
B00969GFFU|3.0|Took me a while to work my way through this book--some of it out of pure pleasure and some of it because of drudgery.  I found the central story quite interesting and enjoyed the character development, but it felt like Franzen had a list at his side while writing of topics he wished to address.  At times he makes wonderful points by showing them through the action of the characters and the story, but once you get in the core of the book, the writing just gets lazy and he simply starts telling us the ideas that he wants to express....rather than developing them through the context of the novel.<br /><br />This feels like a book in need of a serious edit, which apparently it did not receive.  All the political points he wishes to make, where he tells us what he thinks of Bush2 and his cronies adds really nothing to the story in the way it's presented.  Doesn't move the story forward or develop the characters more deeply....these diversions simply provide a platform for Franzen to pontificate.  My disappointment in these parts of the book have nothing to do with any disagreement with what he has to say, but if you hacked all this out of this severely bloated book, it wouldn't affect the story or the characters one bit.  In the end, you'd have a far more taunt read in every respect.<br /><br />Sadly, opportunity missed and a middling 3 star response.
B004B8DH98|4.0|Not much dialogue, but still a good film.  It was suspenseful and made my flight go by quickly, so it served its purpose!

B005LAIIJY|5.0|I saw this movie advertised on TV when it was coming out to theaters.  I never got the chance to go see it but wanted to. So I rented it on Directv and then ordered it for my movie collection.  It is full of blood, and foul language, but also some funny, funny stuff! If you don't like violence and blood not for you...but I love this movie and the actors were excellent in this movie!
B002WJI66C|3.0|My goddaughter loves King Boo. The only issue is that the material used for Boos teeth is very thin and may eventually come off or rip.
B001BWDG0W|5.0|My family (except my husband, oh well)  really love the movie and this is one of the only soundtracks that all four of our kids agree on and want to listen to in the truck over and over and over again.

B009JBZH54|5.0|What is not to love, this is the best batman set ever. Chris Nolan's trilogy is simply jaw dropping. All three of these movies are amazing. Cannot wait for the new supermans!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I was as excited as everyone else to get this book and yes it took a while longer than expected (OH WELL) and yes there will be more books in this series (OH WELL). Personally, I liked the story, I liked that SD didnt skip years or months. She is setting up for something to come up and I think it is all an important part of the story. I think that the ending did SUCK, you were just reading along then BOOM it was over. But overall it gave some better insight into the different characters of the book and also into what is going on behing the scenes with these two. I enjoyed reading it and cant wait for the next two.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much I bought the 2nd book and whipped through it....now waiting for the 3rd one to come out.  Can't wait to see what Rose will be up to in book 3!

OMG I know this wasn't the end so many unanswered questions????? Will Gideon & Eva live happily ever after without all the drama and haters in their lives?  Is Carey the baby daddy (total shocker)?  Will everybody stop blaming Gideon for their own bad choices?  Will Gideon ever overcome the nightmares?  Will Bret, will Corianne, will Monica, will Victor, will Tatiana disappear ugh, will Elizabeth...

B00CWVGBEO|1.0|I love how people rate a movie high just because it was filmed where they live. Necessary Roughness was filmed near where I live but that doesn't mean I like that turd. Also it's REALLY hard to be an extra in a movie. Congrats on the 15 minutes of fame.
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|I personally prefer the stage version.  It is very well done but I believe the stage presentation is musically much better.
B004SBQAN8|2.0|We were disappointed because the DVD had scratches on it ,and we weren't sure if this would affect the quality of the movie.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Now to wait for it to continue. Ahhh the waiting. This series is amazing. I don't understand why people are getting upset that is going to continue. If you are a true reader you would be grateful. I never want a series I absolutely love to end.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|am taking this off my Kindle.  Its really stupid.  maybe for very young kids but not for my age group.  i never should have downloaded it
B006OE7XM4|5.0|Gregory Porter has his own unique sound.  I was introduced to him by WCLK, Clark Atlanta University jazz radio station, 91.9 FM.  When he was here in Atlanta, last year I missed him.  Some of my favorite songs on this CD are Be Good, Painted on Canvas, On My Way to Harlen and When Did You Learn.  I loved his interview with Bob Edwards, NPR, on Sunday, May 24, 2013.  I'm looking forward to purchasing WATER, which is another one of Gregory's CDs.

Believe me, it answers a few lingering questions, like why is everyone so tall and why are some of us so impulsive and aggressive! Maybe it cannot all be Viking blood that is responsible, but the show is outstanding entertainment and has the substance of history.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This book has been on my list to read for over a year. So, when it won the Pulitzer, I immediately dove in. My only regret is that I didn't lock myself away for a weekend and read it without sleeping. Such a sweeping saga and beautiful story of a North Korean man who starts out as a &#34;yes&#34; man in his youth who does whatever is asked of him, and grows into a fearless, quietly rebellious man who defies the &#34;Dear Leader&#34; himself. It is a mystery, a love story, and a thriller The author really shines a light on life in North Korea, which was especially interesting and captivating. I highly recommend this novel.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|i thought id lost my kindle purchases when my tablet quit working n had no comp. wow sooo glad i found this app for my android phone!! fast ez download n works fantastic!! all my books were still there...just an e-mail /password away!! whoot whoot!! n yes the app itself is even better !!  def recommend it!!

B0050DIWFC|3.0|Family trama, dealing with a troubled child, murdered student. Skipped through a lot of it and didn't like the ending.
B003L77FYS|1.0|Our family just loves &#34;Castle&#34; and we enjoy, periodically, viewing older shows, either on reruns or on DVD.  We have bought the first 4 complete seasons on DVD.  When we got to the third disc of the third season, it wouldn't play; all others were just fine.  I wrote Amazon, followed all their guidelines, but -- to date -- got no meaningful answer.  This review is my first attempt to move somebody to do something by going public.  I can't believe that such a large, reputable company shafted me.<br /><br />However, back to the show.  It's amazingly good.  The writing is excellent, you almost see/hear the writers having a good time, giving the characters their lines.  The characters, almost from the first show, are very well-crafted and human, not super-human.  The plots are a little stretched here and there to fit the story into the show's premise, but it's all done in good spirit and a sense of humor.  Highly recommended, in spite of Amazon's behavior.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|The entire series is amazing. These books are tough to read on the kindle because you really need to refer to the maps and family bios often to keep everything straight
B00CW665VI|5.0|Fan-effing-tastic. Poop-yourself-laughing sly, droll humor. Vivid, unforgettable characters, both H/h hold their own going toe to toe. Char-your-t*ts hot sexiness. Unpredictable perfection. Too much greatness to quote it all here. One of my favorites: The hero's 6-year old niece says, \\"Johnny Fitzgerald says his penis is better than my bagina.*\\" To which, reluctant hero in love replies, \\"Johnny Fitzgerald is an idiot. Vaginas beat penises every time. They're like kryptonite. Penises are defenseless against them.\\"<br /><br />There are 500+ reviews before I add this rave, every one well deserved. And I predict with 99.99% certainty that when you finish reading Tangled, you will add your own, no matter how many thousands there will be by then. It's just that outrageously, brilliantly, wickedly great.<br /><br />This is how sexy's done. Popular, ponderous, 50 pale greige shades of Twilight fanfic, and its sub-dom angst-y heavy breathing, is put to shame by the rollicking sexy-as-all-get-out story this is.<br /><br />*not a typo.<br /><br />If you read the negative reviews, here is what I think about their concerns after having read the book:<br /><br />1) To the domestic abuse lawyer who sees a potential client in every snarky interchange between H/h: Drew loves women like a frat boy does, with his little brain only, until Kate slaps him upside his big brain. She more than holds her own, he grovels to earn another chance with her. Hello? He's immature, not unhinged. Yes, sexually he's been naughty (many one-night partners). Also nice (condoms, safe sex, willing to forgo it once the box was empty). BTW, I know some exemplary husbands and fathers of daughters who were brazen, repulsive, deplorably-behaved bachelors before meeting their mates. Young men can be dogs. That's life, not a criminal offense.<br /><br />Is a man who is sexually promiscuous necessarily a misogynistic bastard? Were the four women in Sex in the City nothing but pathological sluts? IMO, no on both counts.<br /><br />2) In terms of humor, Emma Chase's book does not require suspension of disbelief, she inspires nostalgia. If you've spent time living in the NYC/tri-state area, the rat-a-tat delivery and gutting splitting observations are a matter of civic pride. (B&T is included in this.)<br /><br />3) Drew isn't far-fetched, funny-wise. He sounds like investment bankers I've known, but funnier, because we're always inside his head. If you don't believe me, read Michael Lewis' non-fiction account of his years at an investment bank. \\"Big swinging dicks\\" are what they called themselves, people. Their emailed jokes are spit-take, grosser-than-all-get-out-and-forward-to-everyone-you-know funny. These guys are not funny for a living; they are sharks for a living, they do funny for the sheer joy of it.<br /><br />4) This is not Young Adult fiction. Judge it for appropriateness accordingly.<br /><br />5) Political correctness is the bane of contemporary culture. Reviews that say, 'He's obviously a misogynist who is abusing her and this book romanticizes emotional abuse and influences young women to be doormats' make me sad. I'm sad they cannot distinguish fact from fiction, immaturity from menace, as most readers can. No book can turn your brains to pudding or convince you to take someone's crap. Ever.<br /><br />6) The criticisms of Drew/narrator/hero in this novel underscore the God-awful trend today to pathologize boyhood/manhood. Consider:<br />a) Ritalin to 'cure' little, active, busy boys who by nature are born with ants in their pants and cannot sit still or be quiet like 'good' little girls.<br />b) Knee-jerk accusations of misogyny when a guy has had sex with women with whom he has no emotional connection.<br />c) Resentment that there may be a body count before a man finds his mate. (Men, too, can and have been crushed by someone they loved but who didn't reciprocate feelings or fell out of love. Do they whine and moan that those women are misanthropic sociopaths? No.)<br /><br />In sum,<br />Tangled can be a delightful, entertaining read if you get what I'm saying.hs? No.)<br /><br />In sum,<br />Tangled can be a delightful, entertaining read if you get what I'm saying.

B008NIS2SS|5.0|The composite sets offered under the Real Gone Jazz label offer classic performances from the lfifties and early sixties at affordable -no, absurdly inexpensive! --prices.

I prefer Motian to either Connie Kay or Philly Joe Jones as drummer for the ever so subtle Evans, but neither of the latter disappoints. As much as I love Evans with his classic trio -they are the BEST albums in the collection--I have a great fondness  for the double piano quartet with Bob Brookmeyer, who, as always, is fascinating and idiosyncratic, and I love the quartet with Cannonball (playing at his lyrical and emotive best) and Percy Heath and Connie Kay. If you don't mind having minimal information about sessions, this collection is wonderful.<br /><br />One last comment: the interplay among bassist Scott LaFaro, drummer Paul Motian, and pianist Evans is one of the great partnerships in jazz, and it still feels highly innovative. The ways in which they play with rhythm --pulse, really-- and the modulations of sound and notes they produce are wonderful even today, fifty some years later.y, fifty some years later.soloist -he wasn't all that original in what he played but I liked his tone and he contrasted well with the more abstract and original Dolphy and Hubbard on The Blues and the Abstract Truth. The pieces on this album sound more conventional to me fifty years later and thus less interesting. I could definitely do without the Latin album  --what were they attempting -to make Dolphy popular? -but as always Dolphy plays well.<br /><br />SILVER, Horace.  Seven Classic Albums.

The musicians are first rate, the music always cooks, sizzles, and Silver wrote interesting tunes. Silver wrote funky but intelligence-driven as well as testosterone-driven songs and he did all sorts of musically interesting things in them -second melodies, longer than normal bridges and odd rhythm shifts, and underneath it all, underneath his burning soloists, he played interesting stuff, much more thansimple chord-based comping. He remains, as he has been for sixty years now, a truly interesting composer and pianist, and a hell of a combo leader.<br /><br />JONES.  Eight Classic Albums.

Les Spann, guit, flt; Phil Woods, alto sx; Julius Watkins, FR horn; Patti Bown, p; Art Farmer, tpt; Charles Mingus, Paul Chambers, b; Herbie Mann, flt.<br /><br />The Quincy Jones set contains three superior albums -This Is How I Feel About Jazz, The Great Wide World of Jazz, and The Great Wide World of Jazz Live--some that are less exciting, and one -I Dig Dancers--that is outright boring. This Is How I feel About Jazz is one of the great mainline small band albums of fifties jazz, to be rated along Milt Jackson's Plenty, Plenty Plenty Soul (which was arranged by Jones) and Benny Carter's Further Definitions. Listen especially to the brilliant, subtle, loving trumpet work of Art Farmer, all done with mute, because Quincy wanted to highlight its loveliness. The Great Wide World of Jazz highlighted his European touring band, with soloists like Phil Woods (listen to him on \\"I Never Has Seen Snow\\") and unduly neglected French hornist Julius Watkins (\\"Everybody's Blues\\").  The best cuts on this collection are superb. But you have to accept a certain amount o=f dross along with them. None of the cuts are bad - -Quincy is too good an arranger for that- but some of are less than thrilling. Much less
1444737090|5.0|Great story of love and hope.  Wish it would have been a bigger book.  I have passed it around to my friends and they all love it also..  When will the movie be out?
B001TW69J4|5.0|One of the big problems with a lot of technical music is that the only thing it has to offer is virtuosity. Sure, there are a ton of fast notes and it's very impressive that an instrumentalist reached that level, but that's it; the interesting part is in that idea, not the music itself, and, in the end, it's the music that matters. That's where Animals as Leaders differs from so many. Yes, it's showy. Yes, Tosin Abasi is a jaw-droppingly amazing guitarist. The thing is, the music is good stuff in and of itself. It's exciting, unique, diverse, truly interesting, and just fun to listen to. Give it a shot. You might just not regret it.

B0093ST02E|3.0|It was okay... By far not the best movies I have seen the actors in but it pretty much tells it how it is when you are bored with life or when things just get too routine in life... We all need a little bit of spice in our lives, I think she went a little too far because I do believe strongly in the sanctity of marriage but it was overall a good movie... Don't let your children watch it though, it does get a little graphic towards the end.

B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Queens of the Stone age for quite a while now. So much so that I paid over $50 just to get a used copy of their self-titled album back before it was remastered. Needless to say, hearing about this new album got me pretty excited for June 4th. Well, it's here, and I couldn't be more satisfied with what they delivered.<br /><br />Homme has a way of creating works of art that are worlds apart, yet still share the same feel and sound. It's hard to believe the same band recorded \\"My God is the Sun\\" and \\"Like Clockwork\\", let alone put them on the same album. But they did, and this album is Queens of the Stone Age through and through. As an added bonus, some of the tracks even have a pretty noticeable Them Crooked Vultures vibe to them. This is a compliment.<br /><br />I don't know what else there is to say about this album... it's incredible. Each track is great. Homme is at the top of his game, as always, and the \\"guest stars\\" shine pretty brightly in their own right as well. Whether you like the harder-rock style of Queens or the introspective, somber tracks, this album has some of everything to offer. Era Vulgaris may have come out 6 years ago, but in spite of that passage of time, they still remain one of the greatest bands around. Stop reading this and buy the thing.
B00CATSONE|4.0|This is a Great short read that really gets the creative juices flowing and make you stop to think about your choices in life. I recommend this to all adventures...perhaps you'll find your own creative genius.
B00CRR5YA0|4.0|Really good sound track but not as good as the first one... Still worth buying though. Loved the movie,  should watch before purchasing!!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The entire series is amazing. These books are tough to read on the kindle because you really need to refer to the maps and family bios often to keep everything straight
B005HSL626|2.0|Boring! How many fruits can you chop up. What a total snooze this game is. Don't waste your time, ok.
B00000F1D3|3.0|Cher is usually great.  I do not particularly enjoy or like the selection of songs on this product.Cher is usually great.  I do not particularly enjoy or like the selection of songs on this product.

B00CL50LEC|5.0|I'm not usually into sentimental movies but I love zombie flicks and this movie really snuck up on me.  The comedy is subtle and clever using such an absurdly surreal plot to full advantage with special emphasis on R's (Nicholas Hoult) inner monologue; great performance btw, I mean how exactly does one portray a conflicted zombie?  I also really enjoyed watching Teresa Palmer (R's love interest Julie) as she simultaneously plays sort of Resident Evilesque zombie fighter and the love-struck girl from next door.  I honestly doubt this movie would have worked without the addition of a fine supporting cast which is why i think it's noteworthy to mention R's zombified BFF (i.e. M played by Rob Corddry) as well as Julie's girlfriend Nora (Analeigh Tipton) and I can't leave out John Malkovitch as the disapproving father and last defender of humanity.<br /><br />Warm Bodies is NOT your typical zombie movie even though the director (Jonathan Levine) employs visual techniques common to the genre and despite the cover I wouldn't even classify it as a romantic comedy but rather an extremely original and quirky story that just may actually warm even the most cynical heart.  :o)
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Quite a cast of Louisiana characters - glad captioning was available so we could understand all the dialog.  We're big TLJ fans and watched it because of him - and he's in every scene!  The characters in the movie make it worth watching even though some of the storyline is a little strange.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The entire series is amazing. If youre watching the show you really ought to read the books. These books are tough to read on the kindle because you really need to refer to the maps and family bios often to keep everything straight
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|This story is so life like that it seems events are moving without a script. It is a recording of a very human experience and not a drama played out by a set of writers, actors, and a director. Somewhat Woody Allenesque.
B00AGJ4HC2|4.0|Love Letter is a fast paced game of bluffing and calling.  The 16 cards provide a surprising amount of depth in a game that's literally play-a-card-draw-a-card.  I feel that the game only works with four players: two players is too random to be meaningful and three players limit the insight granted from counting cards in the deck.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|For starters, this book was ALL OVER the place. I don't know if Sylvia Day is trying to get stories lined up for the next book, but I paid for this book and got nothing from it except the word \\"Angel\\"...OMG!!! So many unanswered questions and plots that tend to make u feel like its important and and just hanging out in the wind...WTH? The relationship of the 2 main people is getting really tired, and I am sick of reading the word \\"Angel.\\" The receptionist and her roommate , the male co worker,the ex girlfriends husband, the journalist,  the cop.... The list goes on how many new unimportant or important people are thrown in and u have no understanding of why.  \\"Bared to you\\" and \\"Reflected in you\\", I loved... This one will be known to me as \\"I'm done with You\\".
0393343405|5.0|Greenblatt is a Harvard Classics professor with a serious tale to tell and he does it in a most engaging way.  This is the second book of his I couldn't put down.  The Swerve may change your thinking.  Recommend most highly.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are great as these unsettled characters. It's a mixed up, crazy, chaotic world these characters live in and you definitely get caught up in it.  If you can handle the language, you'll definitely enjoy this movie.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Honestly, I don't understand why people are giving this book bad reviews on the basis that we are going to get MORE GIDEON... doesn't make any sense to me.<br /><br />That being said.  I loved this book.  It has lots of really steamy scenes.  Very emotional scenes.  The characters are growing and changing.  Since the publisher asked Mrs. Day to make this into a 5 book series, she starts developing some of the secondary characters to round out the story.  I like this.  I'm emotionally invested in Cary, and would like to see his story rounded out.<br /><br />Don't take all of the one star reviews to terribly serious-- they are mostly just because of the extension of the series.  This book is just as solid as the previous two, and makes way for Eva & Gideon's story to continue.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Great story. Well played. Good direction. But not quite the drama I expected. Great experience for Ben Affleck. Good to see him mature in front of our eyes.
B00932A4XE|3.0|I was a little disappointed. For some reason I expected something different. Movie was ok nothing special. I would not recommend it to my friends.
B00687PWQG|4.0|Don't feel like writing anything. It's great! I'm hooked! Man, aren't the star ratings enough? Nor two three four five.
B004T32SOK|5.0|Best windows and mac integration.  I use it every day to back up work and personal files.  Kudos to them
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Very good plot line and excellent acting.  Game of Thrones keeps you engaged and wanting to see what happens next.

B001XV09UG|3.0|Nothing extraordinary in acting or in script. Bunch of people living out an unrealistic life. Will not see it again.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|In this game you will love it! 1: THERE ARE  TWO ON NOMS! Really fun! You will love it! Your kids will love it and it is Not a  waste of money!
B000HAB4KS|5.0|Don't feel like writing anything. It's great! I'm hooked! Man, aren't the star ratings enough? Nor two three four five. Great sci fi.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Overall- I would give this book a 4.5.  It wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but still a great read for the series.  I loved seeing more of Gideon's softer side.  Can't wait for the next book!
B00B5A9FOG|5.0|I am ever so saddened to see this series come to an end. I immensely enjoyed this series and looked forward to Season Five.  I couldn't wait for a certain channel in the states to broadcast season five so I ordered the DVD. While the final season is good it lacks the carefree bantering and camaraderie done in seasons 1-4 and is much more serious. I won't divulge too much so I don't give away the plot or outcome but will say that it could have ended better than it did. I feel that it did a disservice to the fans and ended too abruptly but this is coming from a fan that did not want the series to end. The acting was spot on and well produced and was movie quality. I will remain a life-long fan of this group of newly discovered, fine actors. A very, very impressive series that will sit proudly and prominently in any collector's space.<br /><br />One of the very appealing aspects of this series is that it is for families to enjoy: From ages 3 to 100+. You won't find swearing or raunchy sex scenes in this series.
B003L77GGU|5.0|Love this show!  Season 6 was a little slow to start but It always ends up being really good and entertaining.
B002XXNSF6|5.0|The director and the actors have combined talents to make this a simple but lucid tale that moves along at almost the pace that life itself does. Very life like.
B0091WD4ZQ|1.0|Did not hold my interest at all.  I was really disappointed because I wanted to see Before Sunset and the new movie (can't think of the name) but now I'm hesitant.  Very slow moving.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I'm so disappointed!  First. You charge 9.99 per book -and you spend 1/2 of book telling us everything. About the characters. That we already know.  Then you leave the ending in a cliff hanger?  What a joke you could of finished. The book-  I agree with other reviews. .. u r interested in money rather than a good book.  I'm done..
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It came with such twists and turns. Action, drama, and adventure was in every single chapter. One of the most amazing books I've read in the longest of times.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I know people are upset that this isn't the end and I'm a little disappointed too but the book is great. It goes right along like all the others and is really great. I can't wait for the next one. I just hope I don't have to wait long!
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I like because now I know what to buy music. That way I do not gest what type of music.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|This is a fun game I wish it came with all of the levels and didn't utilize microtranscations to unlock the rest of the levels! I already paid for the game, I don't want to have to pay again for more content
B000IDGBWU|5.0|Still like it everytime I see it.  Great dancing and Swayze was soooo handsome.  One of those wonderful timeless movies.
1476733953|4.0|Truly a great book.  Hugh created a great world and set of characters.  I took off one star because he jumped around too much.  He could have told this beautifully in a linear fashion but decided against it.  The other major problem is the audio book.  The reader of the audio book is truly the worst I have ever heard.  I could not listen to it for more than a few minutes.  Absolutely horrid reader.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good if you like Gore,death,fighting,and romance. I suggest that children 9 and up should read this book. I like ir
B000YMMN04|5.0|This show is described as a fairy tale.  I don't think that is what it<br />actually is supposed to be!!  It tells of a simpler time where people<br />had no experience with hate, mob mentality, etc. etc. etc.  Two<br />people are transported back to Pleasantville and, in only a few days,<br />the people start to hate people that are different from them.  In a way,<br />it is very sad.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|The  Clifton series is very interesting and keeps the story going over the events of two world wars and beyond. This is as good as his earlier greats like Kane and Abel, fourth estate etc.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|I was not quite sure if I would like them switching from matt damon, however this was a great movie, I almost liked it better then the first few. I would recommend it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The ending was a little different, but I would have my friends read it.  The series was good and teenagers would enjoy them.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Although it is heart and gut wrenching to read this book, everyone needs to in order to understand the level of suffering &#34;political&#34; prisoners endure in North Korea.
B001AGXEA6|4.0|My son of 44 wanted me to buy him this video, I never saw it but promised I'd watch it with him, my 2 grandchildreen watched with us. It was silly but funny, there was 1 word during the movie that they could have left out. The word was only used once that I could remember
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Best book in the series by far. Nalini Singh has outdone herself. This is a must read! Thank you Ms. Singh!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game to kill some time, it gets faster and harder as it you continue on. Remember to complete the missions, it makes your multiplier go up and you get points faster.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I bought this movie for my 3 year old daughter and sat down to watch it with her. Since we have probably watched 10 or more times together, this movie is freakin hilarious. Steve Carrell plays the voice of Gru, the main kind of Evil Villian kind of character that is not really all that evil, more of  a big softy. I would recommend this for anyone, even if you don't have kids, it's a funny movie

I haven't overclocked it yet, but I don't think I will. Just a friendly piece of advice get rid of the stock cooler it comes with.

B005BO4OY8|4.0|Source Code<br /><br />SOURCE CODE has an element that is lacking in too many of the Hollywood CGI sci-fi experimental movies that are so very cloned these day - humanity. Much of the credit for this quality comes from the intelligent and imaginative writing of Ben Ripley and the tight direction by Duncan Jones, but the main reason this film works so well is the presence of charismatic and fine acting by Jake Gyllenhaal.<br /><br />It really gets you &#34;Thinking,&#34; which is lacking in most modern day 'Carbon-Copy' Action-Thrillers.
B00C061HZY|5.0|I am amazed at the difference between the Spotify and MP3 master of this album and the Vinyl master. The audio is beautiful on this record and the vinyl is a great experience. Very impressed, and has made me even more of a fan of this record, even tracks like &#34;touch&#34; which I really do not like, gained new depth with the mastering on the Vinyl recording.<br /><br />If you like this record and have a good turntable and amp, you owe it to yourself to get the vinyl for possibly the best mastered record of this decade.
080701429X|5.0|Victor Frankl biography is a must read for those who value life and live it to the best of ones ability through all circumstances. This book has a permanent place in my library.
B008602KQI|5.0|Even better if you have Amazon Prime. They let you watch it without buying it. I don't see much need in owning movies these days but the price was reasonable and before this was available on Prime.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Ted is a great movie, I thought it was hillarious Great movie, blu ray as always is great picture. Bought this as a gift for a friend also and she loved it
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief was a page turner. Its simplistic language allows you time to feel the incredible pain and loss that Leisel endures throughout her journey into adulthood in Nazi Germany. I loved the juxtaposition of her foster parent's tough and oh-so-gentle love. In the end. though loss prevails throughout, the message of hope and survival makes the reader feel good.<br />It was a charming book and I am recommending it to everyone.
B002DPRLJ8|5.0|Its entertainment at  its purest... relaxing, belly laughs no gore and foul language... Beautiful fashion... We so need another Doris Day !!
B005LAIIHG|4.0|Although long, this movie satisfies the adventurous spirit.  Great special effects, and great storyline!  Beautiful scenery and believeable story!  A must have!
1904920209|5.0|I have made and baked bread for my family for years and considered myself an excellent dough kneader and baker.  The rule that one can ever learn is true as I have applied Bertinet's  dough techniques and have produced even better results to my bread/dough creating.
044042321X|5.0|As a huge Game of Thrones fan who has devoured every word written so far (I think!) I found this interpretation of the first part of the story delightful!  I have ordered the next volume and am looking forward to the way these artists will portray the characters (especially interesting to see, at the beginning) the young crows' encounter with the &#34;denizens&#34; beyond the Wall!  Chilling!<br /><br />The artists' portrayal of the characters are &#34;close, but not too close&#34;---just enough to tickle the imagination and remind one that this story still has many directions it can go---many places for the imagination to wander,  and wonder!
B0042RUMEQ|4.0|CD is ok, I bought this for my wife, and she likes a few songs on it, but is not crazy about. She listens to it once and a while.

B0015DYIH2|5.0|I love this book and even though it's a long shot I hope there is more. I love twilight!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!A LOT
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I'm going to keep this short and sweet because previous reviewers have summarized exactly how I feel: the cliffhanger was not strong enough to make me look forward to the next installment. There's nothing to be anxious about, no room for imagination. As a matter of fact, I was hoping for more exciting twists and turns. For example: all these friends and co-workers Eva has can't possibly be so loyal, understanding and deprived of any intention to cause her any harm. I totally expected some sort of betrayal coming from one of them. With so many people invading Eva and Gideon's privacy out of jealousy and spite, considering Gideon's fame, I can't believe nobody found out about what happened in the Caribbean.  I'm a Sylvia Day fan, love the Crossfire series but won't pre-order the next installment months in advance like I've done with the past two books. I'm definitely going to wait a few days following the release, check out the reviews and decide whether or not I should spend ten bucks on it.
B000FC10HA|5.0|Very logical and definitely a must read. As the owner of a couple startups, this book will save you time, trouble, and money. And hopefully make you some too. I am requiring  my partners read this.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|I enjoyed the movie but did not like the ending. It ended as if there should have been more. I hope to see more about the movie captain America.
B000094A6A|5.0|Some guys going through a bit of a mid life crisis of sorts decide to start a fraternity. From there things always interesting. Will Farrell is hilarious in this movie. This movie is a must see.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|The story and writing style were up to le Carre's reasonably high standards.  What was most interesting was the currency of the subject (a cover-up for political reasons) and his references to 21st century technology, notably the Internet and use of search engines.
B009NY43NY|1.0|The beginning of this series of books was well written and had good flow to the writing and plot.  As the series went on though, the writing just got worse and worse.  I was halfway through Dead Ever After, and nothing had happened in the story.  I kept waiting and waiting and nothing happened.  It was like this for the previous book as well.  The writing is poor, and certain storylines were not resolved.  Overall, this was a very disappoining end for what was a promising series.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Good  tension and action.  Brought back those days during the Carter administration.  Evenn if the final escape scene wasn't exactly as it was, the story is close to the actual events I'm told.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games book series is the best series I have read this year. The movies do not give the books justice.
B00CWVGNS8|4.0|Not sugar coated but real life. As a gay man I found it to be a realistic portrayal of life. The outcome is not always as happy as shown but quite often is  in todays world.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|I bought this for my wife for christmas and she loves it. I get stuck listening to it in the truck all the time when she is with me, but it is pretty good. Out of all her music this would be one of the only cds I don't mind listening to
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I am a huge SOA fan and let me tell you this season does not disappoint. Did a marathon of this season in a day and a half!! Amazing!
B001XV09UG|2.0|Lots of nudity And just not an enjoyable movie.  I would not recommend it.  Somewhat hard to follow. That's it
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I enjoyed this book, I thought it had a good story.  There were times it made you laugh and times it made you cry.  I also loved the ending. The story line is slightly different in the movie, which I also enjoyed very much.  Would recommend.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great book!  This is well written the story flows well and has good character development.  This is well worth the price.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I know some readers dislike when authors switch between male and female point of reviews throughout a book. I personally love it. I find it to be a real treat to delve into the male character's mind. Tangled takes this to a new refreshing level. This book is amazing. Drew is effing hysterical and panther dropping hot! I am waiting not so patiently to see the next masterpiece she brings to us with the next book!
B004K4AVAG|5.0|Very catchy cd, my life listens to it all the time, she never seems to get sick of it. Its one of the only cds that she doesn't skip songs, she listens to the whole thing. Great CD, not just one or two hits
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Really??? A cliffhanger??? I don't mind if this is a 10 part story but the author should have been upfront and out there to the readers about it. After all we have books about couples that are so many parts book. All I know is all the mysteries and innuendos is good up to a point, it gets annoying at some point. I love what I read so far about Gideon and Eva, but this book left a bitter taste in my mouth for the 'hanging shads' in it. I preordered this book, I won't be doing that for the remaining ones. Will wait for the reviews. Authors should note that most times money is not everything. Just ask a famous author that recently gave a crappy ending to her series. I won't be naming names here. Just saying.....<br />For the price I paid for this book??? Have to return this for a refund.

B005HJWWW8|4.0|I bought this amp in the hope of achieving a fuller sound at low-to-mid volume levels when using my headphones.  I have a pair of Beats studio headphones which are plenty loud and powerful at high volume, but can sound a little weak at low volume.  This little amp does exactly what I want it to.  It gives you a fuller, more crisp and powerful sound at all volume levels.  It also increases the volume level at least two-fold, but I never turn it up to full blast as it would probably destroy my ears and my headphones.  With the volume on the FiiO turned 4/5 of the way up, I never need to turn the volume on my laptop/phone up higher than 1/3-1/2 and the sound is loud and full.  The sound quality is excellent, and it is very tiny at about 1&#34; square.  I recommend it.

B0007OASII|5.0|it was amazing.  the duet of simon simmons (epica) and roy khan was one of the best ive heard in a long time.  the composure of these tracks must have taken alot of work as well as imagination.  my favorite band for sure.
B000OLRH10|5.0|Watched the movie several times in the past and it is has a very exciting plot, I highly recommend this movie and can be watched over and over again. A
B0064MGU98|4.0|Well done - good plotting, well written, acted, directed. You would never know it's not shot in Chicago. Looking forward to more.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|I tend to hate techno and music that is predominately electronic.  18 yo me would beat me for writing this.  However, this album is amazing and should make you just feel good.
B00821PCJS|3.0|Plot and action sequences are pretty good but the acting isn't great and the dramatic elements are too contrived and soap operaish.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I have been on pins and needles waiting on this book. I wish it had been better. The loves scenes were hot but the story not up to the standard I had come to expect. I will buy the next one no doubt.
B002N1AERI|5.0|if you like evanessence, kitty, or the agonist this band is a combination of them all.  the powerful vocals by simone simmons is downright amazing.  love the rough vocals as well.
B007KUFDBY|5.0|Watched the whole movie and the video and audio is very crisp and clear, fair price as it is an old movie but a collectible bluary, i would recommend as a family video. A
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|brilliant, well written, his usual high standards/ Mr Hosseini brings the people in his books to life, I feel that I am participating.<br />I will certainly buy any book he writes before it's even officially published.
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|North by Northwest is a fantastic movie.  And Cary Grant is so easy on the eyes ;)  I really LOVE this movie, it has enough suspense for my tastes. I would recommend this movie to everyone!!!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Loved the entire series, but Kaleb and Sahara's story is my new favorite.  Will be reading it again and again.
B0090KZDSK|4.0|Sylvia Day doesn't dissapoint all hers Crossfire's series fans.  Nothing's too predictable to be boring, yet we all have got what we want of the story. I've receantly red book 3 from the Blackstone series by Raine Miller and didn't get crazy about it. Sylvia Day do it again brilliantly and I'm really looking forward to read the next one. She rocks!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book and all of the books of the Hunger Games! I wish the film didn't loose so much of the importance of the symbolism and realistic possibilities. The characters are quite strong and the story is quite powerful. Catnis still confuses me, but I forgive her ;)
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|Insight into political battles and what has to be done in order to get their agenda approved.  Interesting movie but not a blockbuster.

B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Good acting, great casting and and amazing story. I just hope GRR Martin gets the next two books done in good health. I hate it when an author stops mid-series.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|(at least I think it is) Of course, the 1st is better however, I liked the 3rd book more than the 2nd. It was a very unusual way to end such a built up story, and very sad. It's neat to read a book, meant for girls and yet in the perspective of a boy. I really really enjoyed this book and the whole series :)
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I had such an emotional reaction to this movie.  This movie just pulled me in and I experienced his desparation while trying to survive on a raft.  Amazing.
0812974611|5.0|It was very interesting and I used this book for a class because it was required and I am very satisfied because the book was in good condition when I got it.
B00003CXCD|5.0|This is a wonderful Romantic Comedy that is filmed all around Rome. My teenagers even liked watching this and they don't like black and white films.
B005H5H3LW|4.0|Space Battleship Yamato (or \\"Star Blazers\\" to most American audiences) is Japan's ultimate space opera series.  Why Yamato and not Macross?  One word: patriotism.  The battleship Yamato was the last line of defense in the battle of the Pacific, a mammoth ship that was blown apart and sunk, the largest battleship of its kind ever built.  So it's not so strange that this beloved ship would become an iconic spacecraft, peculiar to Japan.  The United States has the USS Enterprise, another odd spaceship with a flying saucer, two rockets, and a satellite dish cobbled together to form an immediately recognizable American icon.  Finally, the UK with the Doctor and his absurd blue police box.  Each ship tugs on deep nationalist feelings in each country.  They also have something else in common: the ships are not just machines, but characters in their own right.<br />The live action Yamato was as fulfilling to me and successfully sentimental in its Japanese way just as the new Star Trek films capture the zeitgeist of 21st Century United States, or the TARDIS and its British nostalgia.  The new Yamato reminded me a great deal of the BSG reboot, as well.<br />The Yamato live action film is my favorite Japanese sci-fi film of all time.
B00ATUEKY8|3.0|I came across this reference in Wally Lamb's From the Moment I First Believed.  The character was reviewing his favorite authors - Salinger, Pirsig, Kerouac and Plath.  The only author I had not read was Plath.<br /><br />I go back and reread Zen and Catcher every year.  The Bell jar was fine, but not elite.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Viktor Frankl requires the reader to suspend a self-centered view on life. I could not believe how challenging the book was in its scope. I could only read a few pages a day in order for his profound wisdom to sink in.<br /><br />&#34;Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked.&#34; Who writes like that?! Someone who endured an enormous loss of family and global community, but not his identity as a human being.<br /><br />He even points out the stressors of living in the &#34;First-World&#34; countries, the demands placed on the youth, and rightly demands that Freedom and Responsibility should be hand-in-hand.<br /><br />I wish I'd met and known him personally.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|I was amazed to see Robert De Niro in this movie.  He was great.  The acting was tremendous.  My wife and I really enjoyed this movie and we loved the ending.
B000NQRE9Q|2.0|I bought this set back in December. I finally got a chance over the very cold and wet Memorial Day weekend to decide to watch the set. I opened the package pulled out the 1st disc popped it in the player and guess what, not Raider's of the Lost Ark. Instead it was Temple of the Doom. They had sent 2 Temple of the Doom. I then contacted Amazon about the issue and just as I figured it was a waste of time. I will never ever assume that just because it is a boxed set that it is what it is supposed to be.
B00008J2PG|5.0|Gregory Peck plays a monsignor at the Vatican when the Germans occupied Rome during WWII. He risks his life rescuing escaped POWs that came to him for help placing them in safe houses all over Rome right under the German's noses. Excellent story.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|So disappointed with this book! The story ends here for me! We waited so long for really no answers, no recommending it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm still in the process of using Jillian's 30 day shed. I have lost about 6 pounds in about a month and a half. I'm not on any strict diet and I use it maybe three days a week. Even when I have finished level three, I will keep this DVD in rotation. Definitely not a work out for beginners.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|Oscar Wilde has so many great little quotes and insights about life in this book that I refer back to them often.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|This is the film that started the books being made into movies. This one introduces harry and the other  characters and starts their adventures and they learn to relay on somebody besides thereselves, they also start learning the magic and spells at the wizard school.
0525478817|5.0|Can you EVER possibly go wrong with John Green?! Absolutely, positively not! This was a beautiful, beautiful book. It was just incredible how he made up a fictional book so it was like reading two books at the same time (kind of LOL). But gosh, this book just gave me so many different emotions; page after page, I found myself either squealing or laughing or feeling the pain of the characters. Augustus and Hazel were so right for each other I just wanted to punch something because they were so perfect! T___T They just felt so real and it was so, so, so hard for me to let go after I finally finished the last page. Everything was perfect about this book!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved it, however, not a fan of the last episode... other than that its really good!!! Go Downton Abbey
B00007E8O5|5.0|Jerry is a songwriting machine and has the ability to play Tony Iommi style catchy riffs at will. Heck of a great singer too which he doesn't get enough credit for. A true pioneer of dark hard rock music.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Reminds me of farmville before they made it so complicated really enjoy zoo<br />Will keep playing for a long time as long as it doesn't get stupid
125000098X|4.0|Jeffery Archer uses different phrasing and just has the right amount of English style that makes it so fun to read when compared to other mysteries or thrillers found with the best sellers lists.......and now he is going to make this story go on for another book or two.  Fun read.
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|Megadeth's 14th album , no it's not Rust In Piece but by no means is it Risk either. In an age when old bands are falling by the way side or just trying to recreate their most popular albums, Dave and band have managed to put a out a dang fine album. Fans of Countdown to Extiction, Youthanasia and Cryptic Writings should purchase this album. Actually a 4 star release, just added the extra star to offset the One Star Bandits that troll Amazon.<br />Just found out Best Buy has 3 bonus tracks. 2 new studio tracks (All I Want & House Divided)and a live version of Symphony Of Destruction.
0307454568|3.0|To be honest, it was a little painful to get through all the details and characters throughout the first half of the book. It was way too hard to keep track and way to much background information for me. But I finally finished! I think it took me…maybe 2 months to finish this? It was pretty similar to the first book in terms of how the story and plot develops but I thought at least the first book, the investigation took place in one aspect but this investigation of Salander’s innocence took place in multiple places!<br /><br />The story definitely had its interesting parts, like Berger’s mysterious stalker (which I don’t really…know why that was relevant at all but it was just interesting how Salander helped her with that). My favorite part of the book was the trial! I loved Annika Giannini’s character; that part was very well written and her arguments are very entertaining! The relationship between Mikael and Figuerola…was uninteresting to me. I was a sole supporter of Mikael and Lisbeth’s relationship so I didn’t care for that but it did make me dislike Mikael’s character a little. Just a little. But then later on, he became likable again and the ending was definitely a very, very perfect ending! I was very satisfied.<br /><br />Overall, it was a very dense read at the beginning, but it was still an interesting approach to the most important trial and how Lisbeth finally can continue on with her life as a normal, human being. It was a good conclusion to the trilogy (I would definitely be happy it the series were to continue).
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|We all agree that Layne was the best singer ever so that being said this album is a fantastic new version of the Jerry Cantrell machine. Catchy, melodic, and guitar driven that stays true to their signature sound. Better than anything currently being force fed to us on modern rock radio for the past decade. Give it a try.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|The story line was so different from what I expected, that I did not really like it at first half hour, but I found it at the end very enjoyable, and very family oriented in a kindly, gentle way.
B003L77GGK|5.0|I've been watching Supernatural since season 2 aired on TV. I was always a fan of the show and the acting is amazing. If you're a Dean fan, this is a good season for you.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I had a great time playing this game on my kindle. It was challenging and just a lot of fun. The graphics and strategy behind the game were really impressive. I'm really looking forward to the next one.
0385342071|5.0|The book was very entertaining! I could not put it down! There's nothing you hate about Poppy. She's such a mess, but she has such a big and likable personality. Her relationship with Sam is absolutely adorable and though I found it quite cheesy near the end of the book, I couldn't help but sigh at how funny and romantic it is overall.<br /><br />This was actually the first book I read from Sophie Kinsella and I have to say, I just might read her other books.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|I think this game is so good and it is much more fun than the free version of this game.  &pound;&euro;&yen; ; }
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I thought this game was gunna be like diner dash, but it was better!!!!!!! I love how I can go to other restaurants and talk to the owner somewhat, and u can tip and gift, and do goals, and it works perfectly fine!!!!!! I recommend this game, dragon story, pet shop story, and zoo story!!!!!!!!! :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fantastic game myself and my young daughter are both addicted to this game my daughter wishes that you could get donkeys though.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Good movie. It keeps your attention. No lulls even though only two main characters. I thought it was well written and well acted.
B0068THAGY|4.0|Lots of action, but did not flow very well. Plot is not Speilberg. Just ok. Stay with it and enjoy
B007V5CF5K|3.0|Thought I was doing something wrong when I got to level 3 and couldn't get a piece of the record. It is stuck behind the tab of the Kindle (right side). So I looked at the reviews and sure enough, it's a problem for all Kindle Fire users. Won't be able to go any further. Darn!!! I love the Alawar HO games, but this one disappointed me due to this glitch. Still they are the best of this genre.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I am enjoying the game a lot. I wish I could choose my own pics and music though. That would be nice.
B004EPZ06G|1.0|I received the box w/ NO DVD in it!!! It only had a piece of paper w/ a code to watch it on line!!!! I have sent an email, but heard back from no one!!<br /><br />Movie is great, but I wanted a DVD, which is what it said I was getting.
0375413405|5.0|I had just finished reading My Life in France by Julia Child and realized I should add her classic cookbook to my cookbook shelf
B0068MNO4S|5.0|The service I received was excellent and I actually bought two of these, one for a gift.  Thank you and recommend them highly.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|Rodriguez is a legend. His music is for the ages and his humble nature makes him nothing less than a folk hero. His story of redemption (was he every truly lost?) is incredible. One of the best movies of the year, well deserving of the Academy Award.
030758836X|1.0|However the book I received from the seller was not the book I paid for.<br />Never heard anything back from them once I contacted them to remedy the situation.<br />Guess I'll just go to Barnes and Noble so I know what I'm getting as this is the second purchase through Amazon that I have encountered the same issues with. Totally unacceptable.
B007SSF3O0|2.0|...it was very disappointing.  Very slow moving movie.  I could watch Pride and Predjudice over and over again, but had a hard time making it through this one.  Kept thinking it was going to get better, but it did not.
B000SEIBB8|5.0|It's old - yes<br />It does not have examples in modern languages like Java - yes<br />It does not have fresh pattern like MVP - yes...<br /><br />But it is an absolutely foundation of design patterns which are still in use. I come back to this book very often, still finding something important to consider.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|It was so awesome! It was so surprising! I can't see how Season 5 could be better than Season 4.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Such a good book. Really enjoyed this trilogy. This one answers the most questions and gives a better idea of what's going on in everyone's heads.
B00992CF6W|5.0|ItReally good but when it up dates it always deletes my stuff even when I save it on here please fix
B0094GW6YE|5.0|KISS Monster sounds great! Monster sounds like: classic KISS with absolutely new creative breath! KISS have done a lot of work for create the masterpiece in Rock 'n' Roll! They again made ​​a new step in a new KISS era!
B004G600A4|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie. The music is great so turn up your speakers if you have surround sound. This movie would appeal to both adults on one level and children on another.  My 86 year old mother loves these movies so we previewed it for the grandchildren while she was here visiting and she loved it too! Fun movie.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|A Duke who's not perfect and a love interest who's just as human,<br />I adore it. &#60;3 Also the side characters have a life of their own without being plot devices.
B00C8985DU|5.0|Is it any wonder why Paul is so successful? The Wings Over America Deluxe Edition exudes class with its attention to detail and lovely packaging. The bottom line is that the music is fantastic. I usually don't like live albums, but this is surely an exception to my rule. I would like to take time to give credit here to Denny Laine. What is never spoken of is the fact that Denny plays bass on many of the songs on WOA, and, boy does he play the bass well: power and melody. Of course, he in the close company of the greatest bassist of all-time. I recommend the deluxe package of WOA to the hardcore fan and the other versions to anybody else walking the planet. Think of WOA, too, as a kind of greatest hits package, except that the music is live.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This is a cute game.  It's fun and challenging.  I play with my grandkids and we see who can get the most levels.  We all sit with our kindles driving and laughing when our car tumbles and the little man drags his nose on the ground!
B00782O7IY|5.0|I hate all the explosions, special effects and 3d stuff currently in cinemas (at 47 years old I am well out of the main movie-watching demographic).  This movie was a breath of fresh air in the plethora of action figure remake movies and action films.  It's a French production but it's all in English.
B002N14GPE|5.0|I first saw this movie on television and thought it was a pretty decent movie but it left me with questions on several points. Thankfully the D.V.D. cleared them up.The thing that makes this such a good movie is the twist at the end. Now I don't know who decides what scenes to leave in and which ones to delete but they were wrong. I'm glad I was able to find this DVD it not only has the deleted scenes but also has an alternate ending. The part of Ester was probably one of the best I have ever seen portrayed by an actress that young.
B009POCG2C|5.0|We really like Clint Eastwood movies, even the ones that are not as popular. This movie did not disappoint. It was enjoyable and fun to watch.  We cheered at the ending!
B001EBWIRW|5.0|I love this movie! It has a great mix of comedy and 'horror' themes without being too gruesome. It felt like watching a theatre production. Steve Martin and Bill Murray have great chemistry and the whole movie is really balanced, even the singing doesn't drag too much for a musical. I saw it 20 years ago and recently with a teenager. Loved it back then and enjoyed it just as much recently. The teenager thought it was great too, genuine laughing! If you haven't seen it and like some black humour I highly recommend it...but only if you like musicals too.
B00C5GZKVQ|3.0|This is a fun little game. Play is a little repetitive, but the controls work well.  It feels a lot like a real RC helicopter.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Lame ending.  Not much action.  Boring and predictable at times.  Disappointing but you have to read it if you live the series.  Wait until its cheaper or sift cover.
B004SEUIXS|5.0|All-time favorite movie.  I show it to my students in French class but have to skip two scenes that I consider inappropriate.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I'm a senior but this is easy game with just enough challenge for me to play. Some of these games are more difficult for older hands.
B00947N6D8|3.0|It wasn't as good as some of the Pixar and Disney movies have been, but it is cute. Good movie to watch with kids, although I watched it with my 86 year old mother who also thought it was cute. But I know the grandkids will like it.
030789701X|3.0|I received this today in the mail, granted it came from a source other than Amazon, but the actual hard cover feels sort of flimsy.<br /><br />As someone who owns the first edition of this guide in its Collector's Edition format, I can say that the quality of that guide was exceptional.<br /><br />I hate to say it, but I think the size of this guide, page-wise, has contributed to it being poorly bound in comparison. It truly is exhaustive and covers nearly every aspect of the game, but as a collector's piece and something you expect to last, I find it lacking.<br /><br />Now, let me clarify, I did not receive this from Amazon and the shipping method used may have contributed to the corners of the book being damaged and the cover feeling like it might tear off ... but from simply holding both the original CE edition and this one while still in the plastic, this edition feels far less durable.<br /><br />5 stars for content ... three stars for quality.
B004ELSDZK|3.0|This is an interesting little puzzler.  The graphics are good, the sounds/music is different, but pleasant.  The puzzles seem the same every time, but offer different challenges.  All in all, a fun little time-waster.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Inspirational! A lovely story of perseverance through difficult times, and tenacity in reaching a goal. I love that it is based on a true story. Great soundtrack.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I read all three book in this series and I shouldn't have wasted the money on book three. Sex on every other page and absolutely no plot. I have no idea why this story couldn't have been finished in the third book. I believe Ms. Day got greedy....
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I love this show! This is a great show and I have bought the complete show that has been released so far. If you like intense drama and a show that has a lot of twists, this is for you!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel it was really in depth. And it has a great message about mental illness and healing. I saw the movie a few weeks ago and it really didn't compare to the book. I thought the relationship between pat and his dad was a lot more emotional and profound in the book than it was in the  movie, but this book was pretty good. I really enjoyed reading it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I am very happy I got this. My wife and I enjoy playing it. I would recommend this game to everyone everyone.
B008VVT51U|2.0|This movie was frustrating and slow.  Moments would build like something would build, but nothing would happen. Who cares about another gay moment, they built it up, but it was forced and didn't blend with the rest of the movie's chemistry.  We didn't know if the hotel owner's character was a comedic relief or dramatic source.  He was a confusing person to watch. A man trying to track down another man  in India, with its population of over a billion people is completely implausible.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|The first season introduces MacGyver as a clever lovable hero.  Watch his character unfold and develop as he moves through action packed adventures and makes friends along the way.  The first season offers everything we love and remember about MacGyver and more.  These episodes are my personal favourite as the later seasons from about season five onwards focussed a lot more on helping people and the environment (which is still lovely and something I admire the producers for doing... ie bringing to attention issues that are close to Richard Dean Anderson's own heart such as the plight of the black Rhino, and setting up the Challengers club for homeless children and those in trouble.)  The beginning seasons have more of a 'James Bond' flavour, but with plenty of 'MacGyverisms.'  However, unlike James Bond, MacGyver is armed with nothing more than a Swiss Army knife and a roll of duct tape.  There has never been a hero quite like MacGyver and he would be my choice to save the day every time, hands down.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Very well written. Great twists and turns, loaded full of action, mystery and the fight between good and evil. Loved every page!
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I love this show! This is a great show and I have bought the complete show that has been released so far. If you like intense drama and a show that has a lot of twists, this is for you! It just keeps getting better! I am looking forward to season 4!
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Jennifer Lawrence was really good - story line was pretty predictable.  I guess all the hype about the movie was what got us to rent it.  I hate being influenced like that.  It's not one I'd sit and watch again.
B00821OX98|5.0|I love Science fiction so this program is right up my alley. The characters are well developed and the special effects are decent for a TV series. I wouldn't reccomend this for small children as there is some violence and adult language. Also the the story line might be troubleing for the little ones.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Fantastic film about survival and enduring the odds. As I watched this film, I kept cringing, I promise not to give anything away here.  But there are several cringe worthy moments. Shocking that so many people died in the tsunami, I promised I would never take anything like this for granted.  The acting is top notch.
B000002LFZ|5.0|THANK YOU FOR SENDING THIS CD TO ME AS FAST AS YOU DID = I AM GOING TO THEIR CONCERT HERE IN LOS ANGELES NEXT MONTH AND THIS CD BROUGHT FLEETWOOD MAC CLOSER TO HOME == :)
0738737909|5.0|All I can say is WOW !  I have many tarot decks and this is the best.<br />Quality all the way. The book is made of High Quality paper. The deck has vibrant colors and illustrations are perfect.<br />The card size is regular size. I would pay twice as much if the deck was twice as big.<br />The box that everything comes in has a magnet to keep it closed. Very cool ! looks like a book.. good thinking. Also has a ribbon to help retrieve the deck.<br />The book and cards all fit into one box and it is absolutely beautiful. !<br />I have only one suggestion...Please make a larger size deck with top quality card paper. I will gladly pay top price !<br />The finest deck yet !  Thank you.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I love this show! This is a great show and I have bought the complete show that has been released so far. If you like intense drama and a show that has a lot of twists, this is for you!
0425263924|5.0|****Do not let these reviews fool you. This is an amazing addition to the series!!!*****<br /><br />To those of you leaving reviews for this book without even cracking it open.........that's very immature!  How can you review something you know NOTHING about?!  And for those of you complaining that you thought this was the end of the series.....Do you follow Sylvia at all?!  It was announced a long time ago that this was in fact going to be a 5 book series!!!!<br /><br />Now on to my review of EWY.....I think this book was a wonderful addition to the series!  Once I started reading I was drawn back into the world of Gideon and Eva like I had never left.  These characters have grown together and are quickly developing a strong bond that can NOT be broken.  This book had me feeling all sorts of emotions by the end, I laughed, cried, wanted to throw things, wanted to choke a few people.<br /><br />I'm ecstatic that there will be 5 books now, are you kidding?!  More Gideon?!  YES, PLEASE!!!!!!  :D  FABULOUS work Ms. Day!  Loved every word!
B002HWRYJE|4.0|Great movie, awesome packaging. Showed up on time. Wish the digital download didn't require a cd-rom. The new Mac does not come with one,
B009RH9J7W|5.0|works as described. like that rotates 360 in either direction. The fiber/magnet keeps the screen clear and puts in sleep mode easily.
B0053KWDES|4.0|Increase in bass and sound quality is significant...There are 2 bass booster settings 1 and 2 as well as a low and high settings for your mids and highs. The only reason I dont give it 5 stars is because you cant use it and charge it at the same time.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|the actors were not that great, the storyline was terrible.  never understood how the two main characters were bonded.  do not recommend
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|This is an outstanding collection of music.  It really shows the breadth of Duane Allman's music career.  It is a great listen.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This  is total CRAP!!!!!!  It should  have  ended with the  third book............who does this!!!  How can you end a book like that.........its not even an end........ TERRIBLE!!!!!!
B0090KZDSK|2.0|I pre-ordered this book with high hopes after reading & loving the first two, only to be disappointed. I actually had trouble deciding whether it deserved one or two stars. This could have been a great trilogy but sadly it just feels like a filler book that just stops! Sylvia Day is a great writer but I dont think this was one of her bests.
1427229201|5.0|This is the 3rd book in the Clifton Chronicles series, it is equally as good as the the first two books, so much so I can't wait for the next two books to become available. Unlike a lot of follow up books , Archer manages to refresh our memories as we read along so it's not necessary to re read the earlier stories., and before long we remember the earlier characters.  It's a fabulous book spanning several generations.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|This is a rare album, it hit's you slow... I've waited so long for a QOTSA album... so what do you have for me??... What you have is a masterpiece - but what you need to do is listen to this album several times to rid yourself from old QOTSA albums perceptions to get this album - as so you can really enjoy the brilliance and amazement of this album. It's possibly my favorite to date from the band and for sure the most diverse. I admit I questioned if Josh could live up to Lullabies to Paralyze... And here you go! This album has true depth and heart and is so rare in today's music! Buy this album (the deluxe vinyl edition is amazing and you get MP3 and Flac as an add on DL for free)! Listen to it more than once and let go of your preconceived notions of QOTSA... you won't be sorry! PS... The vinyl is 45 RPM - Amazon does not specify.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|Akinator is a Good, Fun game but it is not worth Compromising your DEVICE and SECURITY!<br />It installs a Huge list of ADDONS.  Seems like serious DATA MINING SPYWARE sneaking in!<br />Selling out to Marketing, Advertising and Data Miner Leaches is very UNETHICAL.  All these excessive Addons plus PUSH Notifications are Annoying and can be Detrimental to our Devices.  It is Unforgivable that they never mention any of this in descriptions.  Fortunately, there are Addon Detector apps to help us find the SPYWARE on our devices so we can GET RID OF THEM.<br /><br />No matter how good the app may be, Unethical Deception to Spy on us makes it DENGEROUS.<br />I will not REWARD the Developer for Flagrant Greed and Deception like this.  STAY AWAY!!!<br /><br />It is Disappointing and Discouraging that AMAZON does not protect us from this or even inform us about the excessive Addons and Push Notifications.  They claim to CHECK EVERY APP?  SAD!
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I loved the series and wish they would keep making the stories. Its was a nice way to end my day after work
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|Let's be fair this was not a bad movie. Was it as good as the previews? No it was not. It did not hold my attention, and it could be either shorter or more able to pull me into this world. Wish I would not have paid for it. Should waited till it came on tv.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If I was to say it was awesome it would be lie...... it is so much better than awesome. It doesn't lag like the first one. I highly reccomend it. If you loved the first one you will absolutely adore this one.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|The book caught my attention earlier this year. There was a lot of buzz around it. The reviews exclaimed that it was scandalous and the starter to experimenting with sexual fantasies for many couples who read the book.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say that these books did not stop short of a mega yawn and super frown. This book offers nothing short of some pre-teen writing a love novel. The sex and drama is immature. The relationship dynamics are flat and the books leave one wanting to rewind time, talk one out of buying and thus saving braincells.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Keeps you coming back to see the twists unfold. Many keep you on the edge of your seat. A must watch TV show.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I have seen this movie many times and never get tired of it.  Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend were excellent in their characterizations of Victoria and Albert.  I wish it could have gone on for the rest of their marriage and life after Albert!
B0013TTLDE|4.0|It is a great period piece. It is a little wordy in the description of things. But if you stick with it, it is a great story.
1451695195|5.0|I felt the book was wonderful and accurate to what I know of Heaven through my study of the scriptures studied as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. It was a confirmation of what I already know, and wonderful to know that others are having these wonderfulexperiences to prepare them to receive Christ when hHe returns.

B005S9ELY4|5.0|Very cool, good over evil flick! Sean, Josh, Ryan all delivered some awesome performances! Emma Stone also on as always, buy it!
0385349947|4.0|It is a good read, has a lot of valid points. Honestly, all the major points have been hit in interviews, so if you catch the Oprah interview, there isn't much need to read the whole book. However, a good book for women to read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very unique because of it's characters and how you can upgrade the game and make the settings different.Also this game is good for kids but also it can give them a bad ideas to go and grafiti witch is illegal .So over all I give this game a 5star rate.;)
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|What a great book!  I love that she changed up the story line to have two psy.  He has always been an interesting character and became more so in this book. I couldn't put it down.
B00335EQ0E|5.0|Thanks for Alice In Wonderland. I love all Disney movies. I have a lot of Disney DVDS. They are great.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I was on the edge of my seat the whole time! A lot of sexual undertones. I will watch more for sure.
B0092QITO2|5.0|Love when movie companies don't cheap out and give you all variations you can watch movies on. Very cool, sleek, updated movie with some new twists!
0739366408|5.0|My wife and I like zombie stuff.  This was a good listen while driving back and forth to our farm.  Interesting stories, but we missed the explanation as to how it all started.
1439181780|5.0|If you read this book you must get the audio book as well! It definitely fine tunes the details of the principles in this book,
B002O3Z4Y8|5.0|I bought this for a b-day gift for a friend of mine who has been looking for this movie. I know she will love it because it is a great movie. All of the actors do a great job in it.
B00AZ3027I|3.0|I did not get this one it was to much money. Some day I will get this one. When I get some more cash.
0525478817|2.0|I love John Green. He's one of my favorite authors. I heard a lot of good reviews because of this book but I really don't like this book at all. I sometimes force myself to read a chapter because it's that bad. The ending is so predictable I see no reason as to why even finishing the book. I love Looking For Alaska and Will Grayson, Will Grayson but this book was definitely not for me and I honestly think it's quite horrible.
1451648537|5.0|I absolutely loved this book...it gave great insight into the man..hard to dea with at times, but always a visionary...I enjoyed the book so much, I purchased two more to give as gifts...
B009LXEBD4|4.0|First CD I've purchased by Kelly Clarkson and so far  like it very much.....haven't heard any of her newer songs yet so have not ordered other CD's by her
B005PK57IK|5.0|Exemplary, witty, extremely engaging. My only regret is that season 4 is not free for prime members. I've seen many of the season4 episodes, including the season finale, I just wanted to see how the situation from season 3 resolves at the very beginning of season 4. I don't really feel like paying for it though.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|It was odd that when this movie came out, the reviews were mixed. Now my TV schedule is rating this movie a 3 out of 4. Go figure.
B0001I561E|5.0|I love this one. The music was great. I love Robin William in it. He was so funny. Scott Weinger as Aladdin did a good job at it. Linda Larkin as Jasmine was hot.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I live the way the book was written from 2 points of view. It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire read. Really well done and a great vacation read.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I loved, loved, loved the first 2 books in the series and was excited to know last Fall Eva and Gideon would get their HEA in the 3rd book.  Well, guess what?!  Either Ms. Day or her publisher have decided to jump on the series bandwagon to basically extort more money out of readers.  I'm getting sick and tired of this concept.  Book 3 left so much to be desired.  The story did not progress; the characters didn't grow in any manner and the SEX, which is one of the main reasons why we all enjoy reading these books, is getting old.  I have no issue with any author getting paid for their hard work when writing a book, but $10.00 for each installment of this long, overly drawn out \\"novella\\" is crazy! Just end it now! Tie up all of the stupid loose ends in book 4, and publish it rather quickly before losing more readers, and move on! So not worth the money.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This is a very family friendly movie. The kids and I loved it. Just what you expect from Pixar and Disney.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app saved my life. I was actuality drowning and this app came out of my kindle and dove into the water to save me. it is also a great exit buddy.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|We continue our journey of the Selection process in the second installment of the series. After ready the first book and the Novella, this book continues it journey. When America begins to dig into the country's history, we see the true colors of all people in the story. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Can't wait for the 3rd book!
B0090KZDSK|1.0|I know I'm just going to be repeating what most people have already said on here but seriously??? I have been a Sylvia Day fan for years and have all her books and this is the first time I have felt undeniably ripped off. It honestly was a waste of time. You could probably just go from the second book straight to the last be because book 3 (and book 4 I predict) are just going to be fluff; fillers for money.<br />Never have I ever been so disappointed and dissatisfied. What kills me is that I know I'm going to be paying another $20 on the next books just praying that Sylvia Day has realised what she has done to so many of her fans and actually puts some substance back into the series because I love this series and seriously hope that they do have an amazing ending as they deserve... Not this rubbish.<br />Let this be a lesson to all potential authors. If you say it's going to be a trilogy, keep it that way and keep your integrity instead of selling out. I wouldn't have minded her expanding the series into 5 if she honestly felt that at the end of the of the trilogy she had so much more to be said for the characters. But this was sadly not the case. She didn't even try to conclude the story or give them a happy ending. Was a waste of time, money and hoping.
0786955570|5.0|In the spirit of full disclosure I am a HUGE Ravenloft fanatic.  I have the original D&D Module, the box sets (TWO of them!) I have read the book (I, Strahd : The Memoirs of a Vampire) and spent countless hours playing through (and dying in) Count Strahd's castle and lands.  I love this whole series.<br /><br />So, I now have a son who is interested in D&D.  Mainly because he knows how much I enjoyed it \\"back in the day\\" and having seen the guys on Big Bang Theory playing it recently.  Searching the internet for an easy way to break in to D&D brings me to the board game Dungeons and Dragons Wrath of Ashardalon.  As I read the description (or maybe it was a review) I notice that there is a Ravenloft version!  I check it out, see the good reviews and buy it.<br /><br />Boy was I ever NOT disappointed!  This game is great.  All the fun of D&D without the need to read a ton of books (yes, in this game there is a fair amount of reading, but not too bad) or roll a character or keep track of too much.  Yes, some hard-core D&D people may find it a little limited and too easy, but if that is the case, just play D&D on your own.  This game is much better for the first-timers and the uninitiated.  Very easy to play and not a lot of time invested to get there.  I mean, it's probably on par with like a good game of Risk or a real game of Monopoly (without all the shortcuts.)  Great for board game enthusiasts and the D&D curious.<br /><br />The game itself is really something.  Very well-made in every way.  Good game board tiles, great cards and tokens and players and monsters too.  All very durable and cool.  Since purchasing, I have played about five games.  Once by myself to see if it was any fun alone (it actually is) and a bunch of games with my son and some others.  Every time was fun, even when we lost (some of the dungeons can be very hard!) and I can't wait to play more.<br /><br />I highly recommend this game if you are looking for a fun board game with friends for a few hours and you like the idea of D&D without all the books and commitment.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|A great read.  very, very dark, though.  which is something you should expect from Flynn by now.  she really knows how to tell a story.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Real life happens. This acknowledges the ups and downs of decisions made to sustain quality for living as well as the respect for those decisions.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Great read!  Loved this story.  Hurt to read how some of these kids were treated.<br />Don't miss this story.  My first ready from Christina Baker Kline
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I don't play it but my 8 year old son can't get enough of it.  It keeps him entertained on trips.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this book and the others love that thy got married omg  I can't wait till 4& 5 comes out plz don't keep us waiting to long I to find out what happens
0061906220|5.0|Pete the Cat is a great series so far! My Granddaughters love the songs, and love that they can know what is coming and 'read' what the book is going to say. Pete is our go to, and by that, I mean that they always go to Pete when I say pick a book for us to read!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Ok, when I saw some bad reviews my heart sank. I almost didn't buy the book. I was so worried that it was going to be terrible and ruin the whole series for me. WRONG! I'm so glad I went with my gut and read it anyway. It's fantastic! Totally lives up to the first two books. Sure, the series could have been wrapped up in this book, but I'm glad there is still more drama to come! Looking forward to book four and PRAYING it isn't a crazy long wait again!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I downloaded this app onto my Kindle Fire as I was getting ready for bed.  Next thing you know, I was up for an hour trying to stump it!  This one is really a lot of fun.  Great for a family get together too!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|We've always loved their music, the settings in which they record their videos, and their personalities.  What a treat for all!
1476734941|2.0|The FastDiet seemed great which I saw on Good Morning America.  I then proceeded and ordered it.  However, the FAstDiet only worked for me a little bit.  I lost 6 pounds over a two week period.  The food to eat was both disgusting and expensive.  I  always felt hungry and had the shakes over the two week period.  Also all the calorie counts in back of the book are in the metric system since the book was written by an englishman.  Therefore, being an 48-year-old American I could not comprehend the calorie counts.  Either in 1st or 2nd grade I was taught the metric system briefly.  I only know that a gram is a pound, a kilometer is a mile, and<br />a liter is for liquid.  I would not recommended this book to anyone.<br /><br />Annette, Southern New Jersey
034554398X|5.0|The Game of Thrones books were recommended to me by a friend, since they knew I loved Medieval/fantasy/adventure type books. I wasn't sure about it, since all the hype about the show made it seem more like an evening drama than what I wanted, but George Martin has a subtle complexity to these books that is really something I can sink my teeth into.<br /><br />I'm about halfway through Storm, and I already think it's the best so far in the series.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|A fund application that kept me entertained for hours.  Like the option of different instruments and the scolling musical score.
B008602KQI|5.0|A little to much blood and guts for my taste (very little) but the storyline is compelling. Definitely an adult movie. Children should not be watching this.
0312330537|5.0|So deep with philosophy you may miss much of it on the first read.<br />Perhaps a little too flowery in places but still worth a second...<br />and even a third read. Truly an amazing achievement.
B00005AQE8|5.0|I love it....Great album most popular album he release..  Found a lot of mix version but you were the only one with the original.  thanks
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Captivating story with interesting characters. If you liked &#34;the help&#34; (which is one of my favorite books), you will enjoy reading this book too.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this game has everything I want in a app hope you people like it too. If you play this you will be stuck on it
B00BUCW54Q|3.0|Tom Cruise would not be my first choice to portray Jack Reacher but he did an admirable job.  As usual, the movie did not live up to the excitement of Lee Child's books.
0739337270|5.0|The book is essentially all dialog, beautifully read by the narrator. It is a book well thought out, each character is well defined and it all comes together on the last disk. I recommend this for a person who has the patience and fortitude to stick with it. It is a well written novel, full of wisdom and passion.
0060555661|5.0|If you must own one book this is it.<br /><br />This isn't some &#34;how to get rich&#34; nonsense. This is how to invest, not what to invest in.<br /><br />I've read other books that have pulled from this one and they don't do it justice.<br /><br />Read it, re-read it if you have to.<br /><br />Sometimes it is drinking from a fire hose, other times it's a cure to insomnia. However, the information is fundamental.
B00ABMZRVO|5.0|The movie follows a very tragic couple through 9 or so years of painful drug addiction, cheating, and verbal abuse. All the while, it is clear that deep down they are dysfunctionally and unconditionally in love. While this movie is very hard to watch, it tells a compelling and engaging story with some incredibly beautiful, albeit heart-wrenching scenes.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I agree with the majority that this felt like a filler book. It did but I still really enjoyed it and didn't want to put it down. Don't get me wrong, there were certain aspects that had me slightly annoyed (her mother) but otherwise I liked it. I wasn't bothered by the ending and honestly didn't even thing it was that bad.<br /><br />In my honest opinion I am glad that Sylvia Day has expanded the trilogy into a 5 book series. I don't think I would have been able to believe in Gideon and Eva's HEA if it ended now. Both are way to many issues that they need to work through to get to their happy place.
B000BNTM96|5.0|This is one of my favorite bands, Ive seen them 3 times and this Dvd is a must for the QOTSA fan
B000PMG16U|2.0|I am a big fan of star wars, so imagine my disapoinment  after 1 month saving it for a special occasion, when i see 15  minutes of stop and play scenes because of crack in the first Blu ray , the rest seem fin.<br />It was a huge disapoiment.<br />I recomend the movies, but i dont know about the seller .
B00CL50LEC|5.0|I would watch it over and over again if my family would let me.....just a GREAT movie! Please do more like it.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This case was what I was looking for, lightweight, very similar to an ipad cover. Closes easily, stands up pretty well on an airline tray for watching a movie. Slim design but seems to protect the Kindle just fine.
B0049VZ222|5.0|My oldest daughter and I are HOOKED on this show! We started watching it just recently when there was a marathon on television but we were missing a couple episodes. It was so convenient to be able to order the ones we missed through Amazon so we wouldn't miss anything!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read this book in anticipation of the movie and now have reread for catching fire.  Great series and excellent interpretation of government.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I liked the book, but it's a definite let down that it was the end of the series. I hope there will be more in the future.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Really good app love it<br />Up to date information and the 4 fields of info on useing your battery power efficiently.
0316789798|5.0|Easy drawings from simple shapes.  Bought this for my grandson who loves to draw.  Had the same book when my kids were small.  All his books are good.
