B005LAIH4A|5.0|This was a gift for my godchildren for christmas. They loved it as much as the first time in the theaters and I couldn't beat the price on amazon.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I went to see the movie and immediately bought this album. The acting was magnificent even if the singing wasn't perfect. Russell Crowe as Javier was so elegantly fitting, and his singing role was my favorite. Listening to Hugh Jackman was better than seeing him perform, because he seemed to struggle with the high notes a bit. Anne Hathaway was good as well, especially her acting. The little girl who played Cosette was a surprise, but very good. Overall, well done, very well done.<br /><br />Also, I got this 20 song album from Amazon for 5$! You can't beat that price considering iTunes was selling the same album for 3 times the price.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a really fun game especially because it is free.  Very engaging. My daughter can't get enough of it.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This is excellent for my Granddaughter's (5 yr old) Kindle Fire and she loves it! I WOULD RECOMMEND FOR ADULTS AS WELL!

B002JYPV3G|5.0|My son was very happy with the cd/DVD.<br />He watches it every chance he gets and has uploaded the music to his phone.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|Thought provoking book, shedding new light on ball clubs` actions behind the curtain. A book I never thought I would enjoy.  I was wrong.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Love this book<br />I don't know how to skip rating it.<br />This book make s me happy.<br />I coke 5  stars
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Wasn't sure if I wanted to give this 3 or 4 stars. The story and writing I have no problems with but I think the story became more about a book that both Hazel and Gus read that they wanted answers about. I also think it was a little too deep for. 14 yr. old to read. I intended to have my granddaughter read it but half way through decided it would be the wrong decision. A little too deep and emotional for many youth to deal with. I did like the love story with two &#34;children&#34; becoming connected through their cancer and I did she'd tears.
B007TXN4TK|1.0|I hate it. Even if it is free don't buy it. Sounds good but if you wanted to just play around you can't do that. You can listen to a song or play it. That is all you can do. DO NOT BUY THIS APP.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|So far so good.  Looking forward to using it more.  Seems very user friendly.  I would recommend it as a useful Kindle tool.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I chose 4 stars because all in all the book was great! But there was a lot of someone and me when it should be someone and I. I would recommend this book to my brother because it's gruesome and he likes that kind of stuff. As soon as my months over for my kindle I'm getting Catching Fire. Hunger games book 2. May the Hunger Games begin!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|totally intriguing to play.  love the graphics and way you have to search place to place.  more please!  I hotly reccomend it.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read in a while. It was beautiful. What is best is it really makes you think when you're done. This was a beautiful piece of art and b I'm so glad I got to read it!

B005LAIIHG|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0<br /><br />Is 'Life of Pi' meant as a story of great spiritual uplift--or a different story altogether--something more morose and sinister? Director Ang Lee, proffers up a twist ending where the film's protagonist, the young Pi Patel, has his amazing tale of survival called into question and replaced by an equally fantastic tale, albeit far less spiritually uplifting, than the first.<br /><br />The film begins with a now grown Patel, residing in Canada and working as a professor. Patel's relates his life to an aspiring writer in three parts: 1) his childhood and adolescence with his family in India; 2) his life as a castaway in a lifeboat with the tiger, 'Richard Parker'; and 3) the climax of his survivor story which includes an alternative story to the one he's just related. Unfortunately, Lee must rely on a narrator, the elder Patel, to tell a good part of the story. This is off-putting (particularly during the denouement), since the stodgy conversations between the professor and the writer, can't hold a candle to the magnificent visual scenes established with the younger Pi (played by brilliant newcomer, Suraj Sharma) as he fights for survival on the high seas.<br /><br />The first third of the 'Life of Pi' is slow-moving. Pi's upbringing is quite unusual in one respect: his father owns a zoo. Otherwise Pi is presented as a sensitive but quirky kid who evinces a spiritual side, even at an early age. Pi's spirituality comes into play later, when his alternative story, presents him in a decidedly less pacifistic light.<br /><br />Perhaps the most significant scene in the first third of the movie is when Pi's father forces him to watch Richard Parker devour a goat. Pi's 'loss of innocence' foreshadows his ultimate test, when he later comes face to face with Richard Parker in the boat. How does the tiger manage to pull the goat into his side of the cell? The apparent unrealistic and perplexing scene may suggest, on the other hand, that Patel's story is either whole or part fantasy.<br /><br />The meat and potatoes of the 'Life of Pi' is the young man's incredible story of survival after his parents are killed, during the sinking of the Japanese freighter. 'Life of Pi' fascinates, when we see how Pi manages to cope with a tiger in his lifeboat. Before Richard Parker becomes the center of Pi's attention, two other animals, a zebra and orangutan are killed by an hyena, who in turn is killed by Richard Parker. The animals' demise takes on a symbolic meaning later on, when Pi proffers up the second story in the Third Act. The sudden disappearance of the three animals from the boat, once again suggests that perhaps Pi's story belongs in the realm of fantasy.<br /><br />Ang Lee proves his mastery as a director of special effects, since most of the tiger sequences were created through the wizardry of computer generated images. From his inventiveness to creating a small raft of flotation devices to keep a safe distance from the tiger and the way in which he goes about finding food after a whale destroys his food stocks, the story of Pi and Richard Parker proves quite absorbing. The taming of the tiger is the high point of Pi's 'man versus nature' saga before the Second Act crisis.<br /><br />The crisis occurs when Pi lands on the 'bionic' island. Again, the island appears to symbolize Pi's crisis in the alternative reality the elder Pi relates to the writer in the Third Act. Once Pi discovers that the island's water turns acidic at night and is devouring fish, as well as a tooth in a carnivorous plant, he concludes that he'll die if he remains on the island.<br /><br />The elder Patel finally reveals that his castaway story might merely be a 'coping mechanism'. Patel reveals that he told Japanese investigators of the possibility that what 'might' have happened was that he ended up in a lifeboat with his mother, a sailor with a broken leg and a crew member who hisfather had a disagreeable encounter earlier on, before the freighter sunk. The crew member ends up killing the sailor and his mother after his mother puts him on a raft. Patel returns to kill the crew member. The fight with the crew member recalls the tooth he finds in the plant on the island. Leaving the island might be symbolic of his decision to leave the situation where he found himself observing how his mother was thrown to the sharks. And finally, when Richard Parker fails to turn back and acknowledge him, this jarring event symbolizes Pi's acceptance of a loss of innocence and the reality that Story #1 was a fantasy.<br /><br />There are hints that Story #2 may have been worse than Pi initially lets on. Was Pi possibly guilty of cannibalism? It's interesting that there was an actual Richard Parker in the 19th century who was a victim of cannibalism after a shipwreck and the character's name also figures in an Edgar Allan Poe novel, again a victim of cannibalism at sea.<br /><br />Ang Lee, as well as author Martel, have made it clear that they both prefer Pi's spiritually uplifting tale of survival to the downbeat one involving murder. The elder Patel makes his preference clear in the film itself. The second story appears to be thrown in to contrast it with the uplifting message of Story #1. Story #2 then perhaps becomes a cautionary tale--similar to the loss of innocence moment when Richard Parker kills the goat. Lee has no problem with such ambiguity as long as the feel good message is highlighted.<br /><br />In the end, the Life of Pi 'main course' will be remembered for Pi's 'story #1' and Ang Lee's masterful visual presentation. The rest, including the lumbering narration, simplistic spiritual stance and ambiguous alternative ending, are the leftovers.father had a disagreeable encounter earlier on, before the freighter sunk.

B005HSL626|3.0|on the kindle fire the graphics are pretty bad.the ads are also annoying but this is still a great game
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Loved this book, it was different than his other classics but still just as good. And I am a huge Stephen King fan.
B0039TD826|4.0|Wish I'd gotten the deluxe version - the extra material on the other CD is worthwhile, but it was double the price.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Love it! Lots of fun. Long play time if you wait for energy to charge and you learn tricks. Recommended.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|I bought this cover for my 9 year old grandson who received a Kindle for Christmas. I wanted a cover to help protect the Kindle that was not too expensive. This is a very nice cover for the price and works well for a young child. I don't think I would have chosen the same one for myself but it works well for a 9 year old.
B0083TXXZ4|1.0|My girlfriends youngest son was given this toy for Christmas.  He was able to fire it twice and the thing quit working.  Also, in the ad campain for  this item nurf never said that in order to have a projectile to leave the barel you have to have the acceleration trigger working.  If the batteries die it's useless.
B004GYY714|4.0|I downloaded this app for use in a hotel in St. Louis.  Tuned into my favorite Chicago station, but even with volume turned all the way up, not as loud as I'd like.  When I got home to Chicago, the volume level was perfect.  Must need external speakers when travelling.
B00867GHS8|5.0|I really dont know what else to say, this is one of my favorite movies of all time.<br /><br />I know have it in 1080p and 3D, and cant ask for anything more.<br /><br />The extras are nice too.
B00846REIS|4.0|Totally different but way more interesting than 50 shades...Gideon and Eva have nothing in common with Ana and Christian, read it!!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. It's one of the best! I would recommend it for all ages. Fun times!

B0063IH60K|1.0|You must accept the Amazon down loader app before downloading this game. It is not an authorized app for my galaxy tab. The game comes with full screen video ads that froze my screen after the third game, I could not skip or delete the ad so I deleted the game and the Amazon down loader app.
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|Kate Beckinsale is in this movie and is in a full body skin tight vampire killing suit. That is really all that you need to know. What is going on in the movie is irrelevant.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Downloaded this CD but haven't had a chance to listen to it yet. I know I'll love it and I got it on a today's special deal for $2.99 so you can't beat the price.  in addition I had a dollar credit so I ended up paying $.99 for the entire album.  What a deal!!!

0525953728|5.0|This is an excellent and detailed account of not only the mission to get Geronimo, but it is also has very informative narratives of what it is like to be a SEAL, and the kind of men who choose to serve our country. Great background stories that have you believing you know the men like they were your next door neighbor.  Hell, they might be!!!  I read it in less than 2 days, because I just could not put it down.<br />The book not only details the SEALS, but it also credits the other forces who supported and worked with them to accomplish this, and many other missions.  Very selflessly written, and I cannot recommend it enough.<br />BUY this book !!!
1452110581|5.0|I have recommended this little book to all my cat lover friends.  It is very cute and funny at a reasonable price.
0920668372|2.0|the story is great, but the paperback is cheap like something you might print off your home computer.  I guess for the price is okay but not what I expected.
B009CPES4I|4.0|In a sea of garbage out of Hollywood this movie shines with a good story and acting.  Provides a light look into India and its culture.

Motivates me to keep myself looking good so my husband continues to lust after me like he did when we met and after having 3 children this helps keep the motivation!!  Loved Loved the ending all though I never wanted it to end.

B009JZTOG8|5.0|I seriously cannot believe someone has come up with a show that is perfect in every way. I love this show so much... it is everything a fantasy and fairytale lover could hope for in a show. You're missing out if you haven't seen it!

B005Y423ZC|5.0|The video of Adele's Royal Albert Hall concert is beautifully filmed from closeups of the songbird to roving cameras in the cavernous hall. It all combines to make you feel that &#34;you are there&#34; for this classic performance.<br /><br />The sound, too, on the accompanying CD is of high clarity for a live concert recording.
B000089RVX|5.0|My kid just recently got into this band so i had to get it for her for Christmas, came as was advertised and man it was fast and in great shape , she loved it.

B001JIDE3M|5.0|Brendan Fraiser at his yummiest! ummm, I mean, a great family movie. LOL. Follows the adventures of a boy and his uncle in search of their family member (dad/brother) that disappeared. Special effects and visual art is riveting. The story line is awesome. Includes all the great aspects that make up a good movie, action, adventure, comedy, romance, drama, fun. My 5 year old son loves this movie as do the teenagers and mom & dad too. From mine shafts, killer vines, floating rocks, giant  dinos and so very much more - this movie has something for everyone in the family.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book has a bunch of twists and turns and is really a great page turner.  I recommend this book.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|If you're looking for a riveting story line - this is not the movie for you. However, if you're looking for some really hot guys shaking what their mamas gave them with a small sideline story into their personal lives - then yes. This is most definitely a good movie for you. Just look at the guys man! Channing Tatum (People's SEXIEST man of the year) and Matthew McConaughey and some more that I can't remember right now. The story line is basically, a down on his luck guy is befriended by another guy who shows him how to make some easy money & pick up women by being a male stripper. Definitely a GNO type of movie.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I even enjoy playing these games with the kids. It's good that there are several versions, it keeps you from getting bored.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks does it again with this beautifully written love story! Could not put this book down. Loved the ending.
B002XXLKHY|5.0|Best Christmas movie since White Christmas! Love the duet with ZoeyD. Santa was okay but Bob Newhart is the ultimate Elf.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works well. I like the tip feature. Large keypad is a plus. Easy to read and use. Its a good app to have at your fingertips.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I think this book was beautifully written. One of my favorite books I've read. I fell in love with the characters and this book isn't generic like so many young adult books are. I can't wait to see the movie.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Reading this book before seeing the movie gave the movie a whole different perspective. This is a very touching story that every animal lover will enjoy. I used the Kindle version and was able to read on planes and in Europe.
B008EAVFFW|4.0|I have no recollection of how I first heard of Haruki Murakami, but I decided that this book sounded interesting.  (Almost sounds like one of his books!) After I ordered it and sat down to read it, I noticed that many reviewers said that this is NOT the place to start with him. After looking at it on my book shelf for a few weeks, I decided that even if it wasn't the place to start, I was going to start with it anyhow.  I am very glad that I did.  A lot of the criticisms that I had seen; too long, keeps coming back to the same things over and over, etc. actually didn't bother me.  I am used to reading longer more involved books, so this one wasn't a problem. In fact, I would say for as long as it is, it is quite reader friendly. There are quite a few literary references from Proust to Kafka.<br />1Q84 is often compared to 2666 by Roberto Bolano, another book that has seems to be either loved or hated. In all honesty, I find little to compare the two novels as they are so entirely different.  2666 has a VERY long, difficult to read section in the middle (but still essential to the book) , but there is not any similar situation in 1Q84. For me it ripped along almost like a long mystery novel.  There are occasionally places that are a bit off-putting, but some of that seems to be the transition from Japanese characters and American reader.  (In all honesty, I really have very little knowledge of Japan, its culture or the people, beyond some of the things that I have read in popular literature and magazines. But I also didn't find this to create a problem either.)<br />Some of the sex scenes stop short of being pornographic and I question how necessary they were to the plot, but they do seem to be pretty necessary to character development.<br />Naturally, as this is a meta-novel, there are still questions the reader has:  Is the collector Tengo's father's manifestation while he is in a coma? What happens to some of the characters after Tengo and Aomame leave 1Q84 and return to 1984?<br />After spending so much time in this parallel universe, we begin to car very much about what happens to the characters who remain there.<br />If you are interested in reading a novel by Murakami, I would certainally recommend this one with the understanding that you are going to need to take some time to realize that he keeps coming back to certain places and then going off in a different direction each time.  For some people, the relationship between the two main characters may seem a bit nebulous and forced, but I really didn't have an issue with that either.<br />I can't give this five stars, but I feel that it is a very solid 4 and a half stars.turn to 1984?<br />After spending so much time in this parallel universe, we begin to car very much about what happens to the characters who remain there.<br />If you are interested in reading a novel by Murakami, I would certainally recommend this one with the understanding that you are going to need to take some time to realize that he keeps coming back to certain places and then going off in a different direction each time.

B000W9DSVW|4.0|I would rate it a 5, but it doesn't have an actual menu you can go to, just a pop up one. But that's just being picky.<br />Good special features (I only watched 1, but there are many listed), but no bloopers :(

B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book and the story was very on the edge of your seat and twisted throughout the entire book, however, even a few weeks after reading this, I have qualms concerning the ending. I don't know how I would have liked it end differently exactly, I just know that I didn't care for the ending.<br /><br />Nick was your typical male character that I neither adored or despised. He was just an ordinary character to me. As for Amy, as I read more of the story, I disliked Amy more and more, especially at the end! I think my favorite character of the book was Nick's sister!<br /><br />I liked how the story went in one direction for the first half of the book and then did a total 360 in the second half and switched gears! That kept you interested and starting enlightening you on all of the things you were confused about in the first part.<br /><br />I believe that Gillian Flynn did a wonderful job of carrying the reader along in trying to figure out what was going to happen and at the precise moment you thought you had it figured out, she through a totally different loop at you!<br /><br />I found myself having a hard time putting this book down and can't wait to read more books from Ms. Flynn!

B000P0J0A6|5.0|Purchased as a gift for a young boy who just<br />recently saw Gremlins and wanted a copy of<br />his own. He was very happy to get it and the<br />DVD quality was excellent
B007TXN4TK|3.0|Sorry, I thought this was an instructional game. It's okay but not what I wanted to have for my Kindle.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I use these headphones at work all day. They are comfortable and sound great for the price. Block out a lot of noise just wearing them without music as well.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|My wife says it's &#34;silly,&#34; a &#34;'Twilight wannabee,'&#34;  with too much emphasis on &#34;romance,&#34; and not enough &#34;interesting stuff,&#34; by which she means &#34;action&#34; as defined in the genre.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|i like every song on the album definatly worth the purchase. If you like any of the band perry's music you will like this album it is just what you expect
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Purchased as a birthday gift for my grandson.  He assured me that he likes it OK but rarely uses it.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|i cannot put this game down!!! It is one of the first games i played on my Kindle and i have been hooked ever since i also love the different swords you can earn super cool
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Much different from the tv series....but it is the basis for the tv series so I love it all the same....Great stuff...now on to the second book!
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|the quality of the pics is super low. It is nice to use the camera function on my Kindle but i thought it could be better quality
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It is well written and grabs your attention.  Vanessa Diffenbaugh is a great author.  You must read it!
B0096YJDNQ|3.0|Not quite what i expected. Very nice graphics and nice idea mapping the stars and also goes right to your location but the controls were super hard to figure out, i dont know if it was just me but i couldnt even get thru the tutorial trying to figure out the controls. To me it was a waste of a few bucks
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Just watched the most entertaining six minutes!! The recap of Seasons One And Two was put together by an extremely talented editor, just enough tongue in cheek to be amusing while providing a clear storyline to hook more fans!<br />I AM READY TO BOOK A FLIGHT AND BROWSE THE HALLS OF HIGHCLERE CASTLE. THANKS UK FOR A GREAT GIFT.<br />Carol, Montana, USA
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I read some of the reviews after getting this app.  You can make folders on the Cloud Drive and move photos around to different folders.  You can also rename whatever name is put on an upload.  I got this app when I had the original Kindle Fire, and now I have the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 edition.  You don't need the app on it, except that the only way I've been able to figure out how to upload photos is through my computer.  That works just fine for me.  I use the camera on the new Kindle Fire HD to take a picture, then email it to myself.  From my computer I upload it to the Cloud Drive, organize which folder I want it to go to, then when I turn on my WI-FI it is in my photos section on my Kindle Fire.  I only have to download it from the cloud and there it is.  It really is a great app!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|i got this dvd for my niece.  Brave is a great movie for kids.  she absolutely loved it.  quick shipping and a very smooth transaction.  thanks for everything
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The book was exciting and dangerous. Once I started reading it, I couldn't stop! I loved the romance in it too.
0345803485|1.0|Poor writing style, poor character development, sort of sexy up to the S&M then just icky.  I would not recommend this book ever, trashy bodice rippers are more of a turn-on.  This review system is forcing me to give this book at least one star but it doesn't deserve even that.  Thank heavens I bought it used I would feel terrible contributing to this authors financial success.  As it is I feel like I am giving someone a few bucks back that they wasted.
0446580848|5.0|I really really enjoy reading Nelson DeMille's books.  I laugh out loud frequently at his humor.  He can be so &#34;off the wall&#34;.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|i use this for distance learning on my KF. love everything. have it at work and on laptop as well as my windows smart phone. beats the heck out of windows onenote, especially since the free version is so incredibly functional!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY loved this book! I could not put it down. To be able to physically and emotionally connect with the characters is a wonderful feeling! There is love, friendship, betrayal, pain and devastation, but the is also hope! Colleen Hoover you never disappoint!
B005KELW26|5.0|I bought this for my Wife, for her Kindle Fire. she loved it and it was a good gift purchase
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've had this app on my Iphone for a while.  The number of translations and reading / study plans make it a very useful and versatile tool for anyone interested in the Bible.
B004EPZ034|5.0|5 year old granddaughter requested this from Santa, and jumped for joy when she got it.  Wanted to take it to school for show and tell!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Christmas gift for my grandson, has the other two, now has the complete set, enjoyed it very much. Great movie,you will enjoy it too.
0062215507|5.0|this book is awesome.  the recipient is an avid fan and was very excited to read all the information and look at the special inserts.
1401233791|4.0|Knightfall vol. 1 is a great book with plenty of characters and twists. Bane is an interesting villain and his origin is revealed in the first comic you read. Overall great book, but some characters are dull and boring some I never even heard of. Some stuff talked in the book is not even stated like why is batman tired, and how does bane know of Azrael. The story is good when Bruce Wayne is batman, but it gets even better when Azrael is batman because Azrael seems like a more realistic batman. I recommend the entire trilogy, but if you just want the bane story you can buy the old batman part one broken bat for half the price. Hope this helps you.
B004AKCME8|5.0|I loved this movie!!~! My kids loved this movie! It has a good story & I hope they make a sequel!
B0084B5TK8|5.0|An outstanding book....no wonder it's a classic. Definitely worth the time. I never realized that Dracula is the ultimate evil.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|Please do not purchase this movie. It is not worth the time or money. It is boring and I actually turned it off before the end. This movie is not funny at all and I had maybe 2 laughs.
B0049J3QNG|5.0|It seems all of the toy stories are a hit with the kids.  Some sequels don't live up to the name but this one does.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is super fun!!! i LOVE it..... i do have 1 little problem though.... the app went black every time i tried to open it. simply just un-install it then insall it again... it is really fun i cant get off it. LOVE IT :)
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I like this type of arcade game and the levels are win-able. Fun game to play with different modes. Great for all ages
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I chose this rating because the movie came in excellent, brand new shape in it's packaging.  Always satisfied with new movies.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Althought it's predictable, the actors did a great job with line delivery. A very talented cast! Cute movie!  I would watch it again for sure
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Apps for facebook never let me down.  I love my new Kindle and Facebook is an excellent app to have
B0093H8HXS|5.0|I never realized how unimportant cpu power is for gaming until I popped in an ivy bridge i3 into my gaming build. Borderlands 2, while not the most cpu intensive game, handled brilliantly on max settings with a gtx 550 ti, minus physX, of course. Gamers will be much happier putting the money from an i7 into a better graphics.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is such an addicting app and I love it!  It is a great addition to my new Kindle! :)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am just starting to use my kindle app on my tablet.  Love the ease of it all.  Great book, wouold love to read more of her work!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This is an awesome app for printing from cell phone, tablet and laptops as well as any other wifi device. It is spot on and very fast. I have already used it to print pics from my cell phone and my husband and my daughter have also done the same. I love it.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Baldacci takes you on the espionage rollercoaster and has you hanging on to every spytrap there is. Yes its a marvelous work of  fiction; but the facts are also undeniably accurate.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|I enjoyed the movie and wanted to add it to our DVD collection.  I think I enjoy the location and the scenery most of all.
B0076XIS4O|5.0|one of the best albums of this year (2012).  it seems as though there was a lot of good music coming out of canada this year.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|My 8 and 10 year old enjoy playing this on my phone.  It entertains them when we have a long wait for something.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I am very happy with the DVD series. It's a beautiful set and is easy to watch individual shows or watch the series in order. The price is very reasonable and I will definitely purchase more movies from Amazon.
6305128952|5.0|My 8 year-old daughter loves horses and watched this movie on TV.  I had to order it for her for Christmas and it is a good, family movie.  It is a little sad in the beginning, but has a good story with good acting.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book is interesting, and if you have read the twilight Saga, The Picture of Dorian Grey, Wuthering Heights, etc you will love the book. The sex is fine, nothing to messed up, it's the relationship of the people that make the novel a good read. The psychological complexity of the characters and underlying struggle to find ones true self make this a great read for anyone!
B0084ANCBC|5.0|The book is quite different then the movie plot but it did fill in gaps of missing information in the movie.
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|This adapter works great with an HDMI cord to connect my computer to my television to show HD movies or TV shows!
020161622X|5.0|Must read book for Software engineers. I haven't complted the book yet, but I see myself doing many things that the author asks engineers to avoid.
B00ARAO720|2.0|This movie is a joke!  the better movie was Quicksilver with Kevin Bacon.  Try doing something original!  The whole concept of this movie mirrors what Quicksilver did.  Pretty pathetic everything has to be a remake.
B009B8YZIK|4.0|I've been waiting a while for them to come out with a Halo movie!  This is a great start and the Master Chief suit is amazing!
B004YM6JLO|5.0|This DVD collection is great, i love it! It arrived earlier than expected, it does skip a few times on a certain scene but it usually just stops after a few moments.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is the first book I've read by Gillian Flynn. I couldn't put it down.  I still don't know how I feel about the ending, but I'm planning to read another book by this author.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I was so excited to learn about this and I was excited when I received it.  Best band of all time.  So glad they decided to do this.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|not as good as the London production, but ok for movie version which i will see soon.  recommended for those folks
0061537969|5.0|I am an animal lover and a friend of mine knows that and recommended this book to me.  I read it, loved it, and passed it on to other dog lovers!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|The Lorax says of a single seed:  \\"It's not what it is, but what it can become.\\"  Indeed.  The same may be said of this movie as a whole, and of the children who will love watching it.  The Lorax is a magical being that speaks for the trees, but in the end there's a boy who also speaks for the trees.  It's not too preachy, but it does make the point.  And it does so with great humor (that's Dr. Seuss) and terrific animation.  You'll want to watch it several times to get all the jokes.  Also, have a box of tissues handy, as it may well make a grown-up cry.  Kids, on the other hand, are more direct: they laugh, they cheer, they recognize the value of the things that grow.<br /><br />If you don't love this film, try the Grinch instead.
0316227706|5.0|I really enjoyed the book, and passed it on to my dog-lover brother and his wife to enjoy when I was done!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Good game play, lots of twists and turns and stuff to find. Good puzzles to solve as to how all of the clues and items fit together. I'll probably buy the sequel.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have played this game so long on computer but now I can play minecraft when I'm in the car so this game is awsome
B000L53D4O|5.0|It's  just perfect for little hands and easy to store since it folds nicely. Everything spins and turns with ease.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|I never got to see all the films until I received this in the mail on my birthday. The films are awesome! Never get tired of watching them.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|So, my first experience with Rahman was with raving rabbits. I thought this one looked interesting. I was right. This game is addicting and challenging. If you get perfect in the levels, you give a tooth back to your little Grimm reaper (strange and hilarious). This is a great game. I only review the games I think are fun and worth playing. This one is worth it.
B008IZYW3U|5.0|It's a great album with new arregement. Every note an sound is a travel to heaven.<br /><br />God bless Freddie, God save Mercury.
0689835604|3.0|Toddler girl liked it for about 2 minutes. Cute book but could've used some brighter, fun colors. Child seemed to lose interest quickly. And this little girl loves books!!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I loved it this movie is awesome and I would recommend it so it definitely deserves the 5 stars .
B0069UP2PI|5.0|I loved the movie, keep you guessing as to how the virus was released in the first place. You have to watch all the way thru to learn the truth.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|Lengthy, and it puts you into the boys point of view. It was great!!! It had great pictures also. Read now :)
B001I45UFC|5.0|C.S. Lewis thank you so much!!!<br />love it!!! amazing! remarkable! I would recommend it!<br />( i love turkish delight  aslo:)))

0142421375|2.0|I have read most of Gersham's books and assumed 'Theodore Boone' was written for adults. Nowhere in your web site did you indicate the Theodore Boone series was for teenagers. I guess my misfortune is being 82 years old. Tastes change with age.<br />Brain Donnelly
0316187216|5.0|It's kind of hard to believe that _The Blade Itself,_ Abercrombie's first work of robust, \\"real world\\" fantasy, appeared less than six years ago. Now, with the sixth volume set in his uncomfortable, hardscrabble, magic-fueled but vey human world, he has become a highly-regarded fixture in the field with glowing reviews even from professional readers who don't ordinarily venture into this kind of thing. And it's such a large world that each story can be set in a part of it we've never seen before, with mostly new characters and problems to be solved. At the same time, many of the supporting cast will be people we've met and gotten to know before, and the axioms behind society and its interrelationships will remain the same -- which means that if you've read all of his books since the beginning, you won't have to have those things explained to you and Joe can get on with telling the story.<br /><br />And this time the basic shape of things will be familiar to anyone who has ever watched western movies of the 1950s, especially \\"The Searchers,\\" . . . although John Wayne is notably absent. Roughly a decade has passed since the events of _Best Served Cold._ Shy South, a hard-bitten young woman whose name doesn't fit her at all, is just trying to keep what had been the family farm going out in the Near Country, on the other side of Starikland, which is itself at the farthest western extent of the Union. She has the care of her much younger sister and brother and the help of her stepfather, Lamb, a huge, middle-aged Northman with a reputation for cowardice but whose scars make her wonder who he used to be. Shy has a checkered past herself, robbing travelers to make ends meet, but she's trying to get past that now. Then she and Lamb come back from town one day on their wagon to find the farm burned, their hired man hanged, and the two younger children gone, kidnapped by unknown raiders. And they are determined to get them back, each for her and his own reasons, and that quest establishes the spine of the story.<br /><br />It's going to take them a long, hard time, though. They will have to cross the vast, empty plains on their way to the Far Country, led by Sweet, a legendary frontiersman who makes a living guiding wagon trains, and his business is booming now that gold has been discovered in the mountains on the edge of the Empire. Another old acquaintance -- you certainly can't call him a friend -- who features largely is Nicomo Cosca, captain-general of a band of mercenaries of the absolutely worst sort, and whose only saving grace is that he's not a hypocrite about what he wants. Cosca is aging badly and slipping into genuine evil as he declines, which is not good news for anyone. That leads Temple, a man of many careers who presently serves as Cosca's lawyer, drawing up the mercenary company's contracts, to finally abandon both caution and his employer, as a result of which he literally fetches up on the edge of the wagon train of which Shy is a part. His succeeding experiences will remake him as much as it does her. But the character who will change the most is old Lamb -- or, rather, he will return to being the person he once was. A battered, agonized killer with nine fingers.<br /><br />Abercrombie's supporting players are never, ever cardboard. Even those who come and go in only a chapter or two are fully painted. (Who knows, those who survive may end up as protagonists in his next book.) The world in which they live and struggle -- and everyone in Joe's works is a struggler -- is so completely realized as to constitute a character in itself. There's plenty of blood and lots of scars, but that's the kind of world it is. I have a short list of \\"automatic\\" authors, those whose newest works I grab as soon as I know they're available without even reading the reviews, and Abercrombie is now on it. Amazing, deeply and relentlessly involving stuff.t establishes the spine of the story.<br /><br />It's going to take them a long, hard time, though.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought the book was fantastic. Took some time to get going...but once it did, I couldn't put it down. Very vivid and picturesque.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Easy to read, very descriptive. Can't wait to read the rest.  Challenging subject matter written in a very accessible way.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book as much as her last one and I can't wait to read the next one! It took me a little while to get it read with the holidays but bring on the next one ! I can't wait!!
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|using it obviously for business... works just fine.... i now have more linked in connections than FB friends :-)  FB for grownups ?
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|I'd heard it wasn't good, so my expectation level was low. But I thought it better than the first one.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have barely put my kindle down since downloading this app it's a great way to pass time. Would definitely recommend this to a friend.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|LL Cool J in a tight shirt would be enough to make this show amazing, but the plots are clever and the interactions between the characters are engaging. Very enjoyable to watch.
B00846REIS|5.0|I COULDN'T PUT THIS DOWN! THE SUSPENSE OF WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT IS A KILLER. A MUST READ.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|The book itself was good but I HATED all the language other than that I did like the book a lot.
B009GEEMLY|3.0|Okay but not the greatest.  Others really liked it.  The scene with Loki and Hulk was the best. Not as good as some of the other animated comics, i.e. the hulk, ironman, etc.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|great toy for whovians, just wish it was metal instead of plastic... nothing has broken & whole family jealous of me when I got it, so it is a good gift for Dr. Who fans.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Excellent romance that encourages couples to talk about and explore their sensuality / sexuality. Not too over the top. Would have liked more in depth Christian history....maybe next time.
B004ZI0NLO|5.0|Wilbur Smith has excited readers with his novels on Africa. He is extending his aura to Ancient Egypt with ease
B0079R8KXG|4.0|My wife loves it.  She takes the Kindle everwhere she goes.  The carrying case is very stylish and receives several compliments.
B00447G29S|5.0|I love this movie and seeing it in 3D was simply amazing.  It truly made the movie come to life.
B000HC2LIK|3.0|The product media and packaging are 5 star. The movie was not as good as hoped for
B0012NVGHU|3.0|We have someone here from Ireland and she said it was a good movie so I didn't want to give it a poor rating, but I could barely understand anything that was said between the two main characters.  After about thirty minutes we gave up on trying to watch it.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|I really like the features of this reader.  Very easy to use and good quality.  I recommend this reader to anyone!
0321857895|5.0|I read this book in the first couple of days since I got it. (a miracle for those that know me well.) I have been evolving my notes towards this style over the past years. I recently started doodling more and I'm excited about finding ways to incorporate them into my notes more.
B003L20IHE|5.0|I luv Zac Efron and this is a great movie.. I consider him a excellent actor and this movie has all of his charm. It is a sad but happy ending type of movie. enjoy..
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|It is a good cd cause of the song home which he song for the people of hurricane sandy sincerely David
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This was a great read and everyone should know what it's like for the men and women that served in Iraq and Afganistan
1455502626|5.0|I read Plum Island years ago but had to read it again.  I found myself holding my breath many times and as totally engrossed as I was the first time I read it.  Nelson DeMille is one of the best.  I only hope he never stops writing John Corey books.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Lots of fun and easy to get hooked on. Easy to use. Would recommend it to anyone. I love it!
B000UD08HW|5.0|with Gilmours talent and the blu-ray quality, it's like sitting in the front row! Something that I plan watching several times a year!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great sequal to the Hunger Games series. I couldn't stop reading it. Keeps interest very well. I would recommend this to anyone to anyone who liked either the the first Hunger Games movie or the first book. Awesome novel!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Hands down... I love this video.  You must be dedicated, no cheating. The kicks your tail in this video for real!
B008LC8TJI|4.0|This is a nice cd.  It has many surprises showing off Adams range.  I am going to see them in concert in Feb.  Can't wait!
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|The action and the graphics were pretty good and believable in this film. The Hulk was a little over the top but otherwise not a bad flick. Robert Downey Jr. steals the show.
072325804X|5.0|I bought this book for my one year old for Christmas, and it is absolutely beautiful. I like to add &#34;collectible&#34; books to  her shelves that she will be able to keep forever, and this fits the bill.<br />It is definitely a big, heavy book, and it's not one that will go onto her bookshelf with other books that she can pull down and play with. It will be kept up for mom and dad to take out and read to her.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I watched this movie with my Dad who is 75. We both loved the movie. The acting was good, the action was good, and the scenes were very believable. I can't wait for the next one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow, what can I say I read all books.  Although I was expecting soemthing raucht it was very tasteful and each book had a great story line.  Plus being from the NW I reconized a lot of the areas she wrote about.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|As good as the blue ray is, this movie is fa nominal. It looks like the 3D is jumping out of the TV. If you liked Avatar you will love the 3D..
B0071PS7AC|5.0|Love playing this game. It's also a good game to have to keep little ones occupied for awhile, if you're okay with them playing on your phone.
B004EPYZUS|4.0|Decent action film, about what I expected. The shots were good and looked real enough. I would say it was better than the last one.
B005P06AAO|4.0|The only thing I didn't care for with this DVD set was words are bleeped out and that wasn't mentioned in the description.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|I have all other seasons, so I had to buy this one! Love it:) I just wished Amazon Instant Video streamed a little better, it takes awhile to connect but it may just be my connection, idk!<br />If you love TVD, this is a must own!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It was ok it really went into detail about what tthye did too get hime and the trouble they had there
0060264306|5.0|Book is in great condition. My nephews are going to be excited to get this as a christmas gift this year.
B008XNPO20|5.0|Great new psych-rock album from Tame Impala. Their last record, Innerspeaker, was great but was also just a taste of where they were taking their signature sound next. With the help of producer Dave Fridmann (who produced The Flaming Lips' 'Soft Bulletin' and Sleater-Kinney's 'The Woods') Tame Impala take full advantage of modern studio technology to create a sound that has throwback influences but still sounds completely modern. Tracks like &#34;gotta be above, it&#34; which places swirling synths over crackly mic'ed drum kick and a whispered vocal loop show how well this group can marry together disparate sounds. There's a good mixture of effects-heavy tracks like &#34;Mind Mischief&#34; and &#34;Why Won't they Talk to Me?&#34; where chorus, phaser, delay, and ping pong are used liberally as well as more instrumental rock tracks like &#34;Elephant&#34; and &#34;Apocalypse Dreams&#34;. Overall comes out for me as being the best rock album of 2012.
0061124958|5.0|Book is in great condition. My nephews are going to be excited to get this as a christmas gift this year.
0545265355|5.0|I love these books. I first checked them out from the library over a year ago. But I want to read them again so I bought the set. Definetly a set if books worth buying.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play, good graphics. Doesn't feel like you're playing against the app just whatever cards are dealt. A lot of fun.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put this down! I consumed the words feeding the hunger to see what happens next. Now onto the next book.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|words to fill space are required for some lame reason, I am sorry to waste your time time time time
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book. It gives new perspective to everyday life and is the most relatable work I have read in a long time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it...nice way to kill a few minutes waiting for an appt. And it was free.  Can't beat that, for sure!
B0034G4P4O|5.0|I saw this on the big screen and thought at the time Im glad I saw it here. but in all fairness to the movie its great on any screen. it does well on the tv set too. what a great movie and nice story. all the kid in us will love it. It leaves you happy you were in the audience!
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This game is toooo much fun.  Especially if you play it at night with the volume turned up and your husband is trying to sleep!!  He's not impressed, but I am.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Like the title of this review states, this app is addictive. My one qualm with this app is that for many of the levels, it is next to impossible to figure out the solution. I wind up googling the level to figure out the solution for some of the levels. Some solutions are far out there. Granted, you can skip a level whenever you want to, but that ruins some of the fun. Having to Google some solutions ruins some of the fun too. Thus, the app loses a star. The app is, however worth it as an excellent time killer.
B0094M0P4G|4.0|great singing and a decent storyline. This is a movie that I have watched more than once and enjoyed every time.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love everything about this game only thing is that when you buy stuff you can't rotate it but other then that I say it's the best game ever and I am only ten !
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I have used thnein for years and loved it. It was originally why I bought a tablet. This pro version is even better
B00APUYN0I|4.0|reviews are always personal and relative, so for reference: For me and my fiancee, this movie is in our wheelhouse because we love music, singing, and laughing.<br /><br />A movie about a capella groups with at least a couple characters in it with quirky personalities delivered on all accounts for us. There's no huge twist in the plot, it's as predictable as most movies, but if you're watching because you like music, I think you'll enjoy it. There are a couple of stereotypes that the writers chose to follow by the book, which is unfortunate in my opinion because I like for the characters to be realistic, but some where pretty manufactured.<br /><br />I laughed, I enjoyed the music, the harmonies and the arrangements, and I'd watch a sequel if they made one (and they sure did leave it open for one)
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Great product! Arrived is perfect condition SUPER fast!<br />Thank you so much! Excellent product, great price.<br />GREAT STORY FOR A GREAT PRICE!
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|It's charming. It's fast, humorous, and sweet. I was not disappointed and I definitely recommend it to my friends and family. Dialog is safe for kids and still entertaining to adults. The scenes are safe too, except really little ones might find the bear frightening.<br /><br />If you liked Toy Story, Shrek, Cars and the like, this one shouldn't disappoint you.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Amazing book, cannot wait for the third in the triology.  Waited waited a couple of years for this one.  Great!
B004FOA84A|4.0|Would be nice if new levels were on game.  Finished in 1 hour and left wanting more :( - please add
1451648537|5.0|just what my son wanted for Christmas. He is a systems administrator for a technical learning company and wants to read about  those who are outstanding in the computer/internet  field.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Grab it! great deal, great music! Maybe get the other version for younger kids. I kinda wish I would have due to little ears on some songs.
B00APUQH0W|3.0|This movie has a nice plot (perhaps a little predictable) with an interesting ending.  I guess the thing that makes it kind of hard to watch at times is Clint Eastwood's over-the-top portrayal of the gruff, aging and fairly belligerent father.  I've always been an Eastwood fan, but he almost looks to be trying too hard at this role.  Plus we've seen him before like this as in Gran Torino.  Amy Adams, as his daughter, is perfectly cast, although in reality she should have had this confrontation much earlier in her life.<br />I liked the ending, so stick with it.  All in all, a nice movie with family situations that hopefully you never had.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|If you in the mood for action this is it. Movie was a good distraction from the cold outside.  Thank you.
B008D30K7E|4.0|This is a tongue in cheek history of the twentieth century delivered through the medium of a one hundred year old man. The man in question, Allan Karlsson, climbs out he window of the care home he lives in and embarks on a series of incredulous adventures. The writing is tongue in cheek, the book filled with quirky and bizarre characters and events. Suspend belief as Allan manages to get around. As his back story unfolds he wanders through life meeting Truman and other US presidents, Mao Tse Cheung, Stalin and de Gaulle amongst others. Different and quirky, this is well worth the read. For the first half  loved it but I wore out near the end and hence 4 stars. A good joke overplayed. I think it should be two thirds of the length. It is in the tradition of Tom Sharpe and the writing reminds me of that style although I smiled rather than laughed out loud.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read. It has a good description and makes you just want to sit their all day and read. READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This was an eye-opener.  Just as we express concern with external central control in our lives in government, home improvement, and main street retailing, we see in this documentary that it has come to the food we eat.  We see fewer and fewer individuals controlling more and more aspects of the products sold for our tables. There are economies in this, without a doubt, but there are human and animal costs that make this possible.  Food, Inc. presents the situation.  The growth of our nation...in both individual size and weight and gross national product is a direct impact of this centralization of the farming processes.  The film's producers note that in all their investigations, those who were investigated were invited to present their views and declined.  I'll give away the ending: think about alternatives within your control to minimize the effects of food production system that may be taking us in the wrong direction. Think home gardens, organics, portion control, more vegetables, fewer animal fats.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Parts of the book are very good.  The story line a times is entertaining but some parts are lame and corny.
B004CAWSKE|5.0|This is such a great album to listen to if you're a big fan of Within Temptation and Evanescence. You won't be disappointed. I listen to it everyday since my purchase. Charlotte Wessels (lead vocals) is the perfect singer for these types of symphonic metal/Gothic songs.... Just listen to it LOUD ;)
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love this cover! It reminds of all the old leather bound books I read as a kid and gives me the nostalgia and memories while reading the very latest in e-reader electronics.<br /><br />Seems well made and of good quality.
B003DRWX9I|4.0|Slash sure can play and with all the special guest it is a very good cd for the most part.
B005CRQ4OW|2.0|The best book ever I've ever read in my life.<br />We'll not in my life but it is a good book
B007RXRSEY|4.0|I like this cd even though it gets redundent at times,still not a bad cd. so give it a try
B0069JBKHI|5.0|Great device that sets up in a snap.  If your wifi crashes that's fine you can still monitor in the household via the bluetooth connection.  I've noticed a slight delay in the video transmission over the wifi but it is inconsequential for the baby monitoring purpose.  Also, the lullaby feature and the rainbow night light really does help put our baby to sleep.  This is also nice because you can move it from room to room, or travel with it should you need to.  Great product from WIthings.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is fantastic!  The Dark Knight Rises exceeded my expectations.  It is an excellent movie, and I highly recommend the Trilogy for all Batman movie fans!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is pretty fun so far. I'd definitely recommend it.  I got it for free through the Amazon giveaway.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|My first &#34;concert&#34; experience with Led Zeppelin and they did not dissappoint- a very high paced 2 hour concert.<br />Kashmir steals the show !
B005FDXT32|5.0|I chose five stars for timely shipping, non damaged packing and great free gift wrap. I could talk about how great the movie is or the quality of the picture but we all know its amazing and it's a blu-ray which does any movie justice. Arrived on time and in great condition. THATS what matters in this review.
0307887960|4.0|It helped them a lot with their diet. ( they lost a lot of weight) It was a gift and they made used of it.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|This was my first Amazon Instant Video movie rental. Wow! I am so impressed with the streaming and picture quality.<br /><br />I loved the movie too. I am a fan of the fairy series. I'm just loving what Disney is doing with the series and characters. At least I still have movies my family can watch.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|I got this as a gift for my brother. It was a lot bigger than I expected. It was also great that is doesn't have many custom pieces, it's all built from regular Legos.
0385535147|5.0|i noticed today, 12/28/12 that this book is number one on the best sellers list as of 12/23/12 and as always john grisham book is a page turner and i finished this book in record time and could not put this book down as i had to know what the next chapter was going to reveal great book 5 starts....
B008JFUTT0|5.0|At the very least this is good listening, captivating music by a gifted artist.  But, having seen the documentary film makes it much more meaningful and fascinating.  I have played it over and over for my own enjoyment.  Also, when I play it for someone else for the first time they always seem to comment on how much they like it and ask who is the artist.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks, and this was another good one.  Love the twist ending unlike some of his other works.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I have used Abobe reader over the years and it has never failed to handle a .pdf document. The do upgrades all the time the program is very easy to understand.
0385512104|5.0|Used this book for my English class, had to write an essay about the 3 main elements in the story, it was a bit confusing at times but a very interesting read
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This application with a compatible Wi-fi printer works perfectly. You can print from anywhere and have your document waiting for you when you get home.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|Wonderful story. Gorgeous cinematography. A pleasure to watch. I'd been wanting to watch the movie for the last several months.  I was not disappointed.
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|The music differs in content from the Lord of the Rings soundtracks, but not in quality. The music was perfectly crafted for the scenes, and the bonus tracks complete the listening experience.
B004SKJTY6|1.0|Nowehere did the &#34;free&#34; offer indicate this was a Preview and Not the movie. This was by far the most lame offer I have ever received. I would venture a guess that everyone saw the previews. This was a waste of my time.
B003H9MSPG|5.0|Nerf N strike longstrike cs-6 dart blaster. Lots of fun and very very very safe. Will be buying more in the next day or two.
B0079R8IYW|3.0|When I was using my husband's i Pad I bought a similar cover that worked like a stand and protected the screen, but it was better because it was magnetic and actually turned off the i Pad (and saved battery) when I closed it. It also wasn't quite so thick.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|.I just started playing, but find the humor curious and the physics of building structures fun,  Now my go to time sucker.
B000YAA68W|4.0|Okay, I just got this movie for Christmas and I just finished watching it. I watched this movie before, but it has practically constructed me into a Marjane Satrapi fan(Don't take that literally).<br /><br />So, the movie is about a girl who matures from a 9 year old to an adult, living through the Islamic Revolution and a number of wars in Tehran, soon moving to Vienna and France.<br />I understand the movie is supposed to be mostly serious, but it periodically had it's comedy, such as people having fangs when angry.<br /><br />So, to conclude this review, it was a great movie to watch and whoever reads this review I recommend the movie to.
B00AECDDYY|5.0|Havent been able to put it down since i opened it.  Has a curtain charm that keeps you playing.  Worth the purchase!!
B005KR6OB2|5.0|It's meeting every expectation.  However, what's not to like: perfect casting, things that go bump in the night, damsels (of both sexes) in distress, rollicking apocalpse and the battle between good and evil, and the seen and unseen.<br /><br />Season one is entertaining.  Season two through 6, down right interesting, and dare I say it, educational.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I'm an avid reader and haven't encountered anything quite like this novel!  I loved the story line, the way the author told the story and the message it imparts.  I'm looking forward to reading more from Erin Morgenstern.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|Obsessed! I have not stopped listening since I received it. Full 30 songs for less than $15... GET IT NOW!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|A great book for young children from six to eleven. I recommend this author to any parent, it's just a simple and entertaining read for my children.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Better than the first. Ally Condie is amazing. Can't wait to read the final book in this series; hopefully it won't be the final one
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Good game and appropriate for my childrens age not to mention the season in which they received their Kindles. I even enjoyed playing it.
0743270754|5.0|Exciting addition to my Lincoln collection and a great read.<br />Everyone can learn from reading this book about our greatest President.
B00A757EFW|3.0|As usual a frustrating game.  Hard to control the movements.  Seems to me this game is only usable with an arcade type control.
075669812X|5.0|Got it for 9-year old grandson for Christmas.  He loves it!<br />It's beautifully done and a great add for Ninjago buffs.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|A great game for both my nine and seven year old children.  I'm sure they will spend hours playing it.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Matt Stone and Trey Parker have done it again -- their trenchant wit and musical genius shine through in this tour-de-force about the tendency to the world of our fair country -- America -- to play the policeman.  it will truly put you in the shoes of the other man -- i mean, marionette.  the marionettes are extraordinary, and this is one time where i recommend that you experience all the extra features.  after Being John Malkovich, this is the best movie ever made with marionettes -- somehow, calling them &#34;puppets&#34; is rather an insult to their complexity.  this ain't no Sesame Street ;-)
B003L77GGK|4.0|What can I say???  I am hooked on the series.  this item came as described and came on time.  Will be using this vendor again.
B005NFJAMG|4.0|Excellent action/thriller. I was expecting a little more from Steven Segal, who's role in this picture was short lived. I had this movie on regular DVD, but I purchased it on a special sale in Blu-ray format, The picture is slightly better, but the sound track is fantastic on my surround system.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I have ever had the pleasure to read. Truly a beautiful depiction of life and the struggles of growing up.
B00005N6KG|5.0|my 15 year old daughter loves these,but she has had problems with wires breaking and sound dropppin g out due to broken wires,just wish that was more durable,or my daughter less destructive.hhhhmmmmm.
B001P06GX4|5.0|My family thought this game looked childish until we started playing. My 11 and 9 year olds won the first few games while my husband and I worked hard at winning. This was absolutely one of the best family games we have played! I highly recommend it to families. This game and Uno Attack are a must have in the house.
0307456633|5.0|I am very glad that I fell across this charming and quirky book about an unusual but very down to earth lady detective in Botswana.  The books are an interesting glimpse into life in this part of Africa.  I only give five stars when I seriously don't want to put the book down.  I will be hunting for Alexander's other books in the series!
B000003N7K|5.0|What is there to say? Perfection. Coltrane, the incomparable, and Hartmann, the voice of velvet. Sensual and warm and a pure pleasure to listen to. As far as I know, Johnny Hartmann is the only vocalist Coltrane bothered to record with, and their collabration is a treasure.
B00992CF6W|5.0|my cousin told me about this game in a hotel it has been my favorite game ever since.now I'm a pro
B009329Y30|5.0|I loved the book and this movie was very well done. The movie followed the book very well. I love it!!
B0083Z614S|5.0|A story for all ages, somewhat polyannish in the outcome, but so well written that the end is logical, because the characters are so well drawn, so believable.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Nikon SB-400 AF Speedlight Flash for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras, This is a very versatile flash accessory for any NIKON DSLR. I used this on my D40 &D5000. Last long on two AA BATTERIES,  GREAT BUY!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Perfect! So glad they fixed it ....must haveee!!!! bunched :(high.  Bob.  Inching bunch he that us Hamm huh B-) have until
B001E9641K|5.0|this special edition with snowy cards made a wonderful christmas present, rules vary slightly from other versions, role of wildcards is odd, especially with respect to building the longest segment (27 points)
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Ok, the concept is funny and this movie has a few moments that are very funny, but overall it is a bit of a bore.  The humor is very much in the vein of the Family Guy, but the disconnected jokes and asides just don't work that well in a full length movie.  The concept is imaginative but the dialogue is not and the plot is pretty predictable.  After the first chuckle over a dope smoking talking bear, the character of Ted becomes more annoying than anything else.
B003L77G06|5.0|Modern Family keeps one laughing and smiling.  I love this well-written, witty show with such lovable characters.<br />I would recommend it to any adult with a sense of humor.
080214473X|5.0|This book challenges you to put it down - a challenge you will often times fail. For civilians - like myself - it paints a vivid picture of a world never seen and grants a deeper respect for those who experience it first hand.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, this volume should be on every bookshelf.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|I missed the first season of this hilarious show, so I knew I had to have it for my collection.  It certainly did not disappoint as it kept me laughing during each episode. The cast could not have been better chosen. Funny! Funny! Funny!!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I can't believe this show is on regular TV.  So scary and creepy.  Well written, acted, and filmed.  The is excellent entertainment.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I played this many times growing up and enjoyed it.  now I find myself teaching my kids. great app for the price. would not change anything about it.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Was very different then I thought but was very satisfied with product very easy to use just great. I would do it again if I needed too
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|like, very much. easy to purchase and watch. thank you very much. ease of use is much appreciated. price is not bad either.
B005S9EK1S|5.0|loved this movie got here quick<br />i got it for a christmas present for me and some one else<br />great
B007KOMTUI|5.0|thanks for ease of use. easier than going to the video store and probably cheaper too. appreciate it , great show.
B00004CZPF|2.0|I would have liked to have known in advance that this DVD could not be played on a U.S. DVD player. Could it have killed you folks at Amazon to put some obvious disclaimers to the rest of us with a U.S.address; without having us need to understand \\"region codes\\" and what it means to our purchase decision. I realize that Amazon seems to be doing well but after ordering kitchen canisters that cut your hand while opening, defective Motorola phones and now this, I think its time to shop elsewhere.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|This movie is great. I would recommend it to anyone with a little bit of time on their hands. :)
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Good Clean entertainment for a Family, so much fun to watch. Wanted the Keep sake. Looking forward to the soon to be seen Season 3.
B000VIHMS4|5.0|I wear a size 8 in women shoes and a size 7 in big kids.I was told that timberland boots run big so i was wondering where the sizes say 6.5(M)and beyond, is that big kids, toddlers, or walking shoes?
B0079R8KXG|5.0|This cover is nice and sturdy, the kindle is sacurly held in place. I enjoy the stand that is available for reading hands free.
B004HW7JHE|5.0|Now my collection is complete--so far.  Love this series!  I can't wait for the new season to start; I have my calendar marked for the first date and will buy the DVD when available.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Visually stunning, awsome,well worth it....really cool game play...who ever...i mean WHO EVER made and helped make this game....they went above and beyond someone's expectations...the only downside.....I can't go above and beyond 5 stars.....(spot on game)
B0091LS07E|5.0|Whatever Alicia Keys produces you can be sure it is result of tremendous talent and work. Buy it and enjoy.
B002WY65VU|5.0|This is my favorite zombie movie of all time.  Now my new favorite christmas movie!  This movie is highly recommended.
B0052U59F4|2.0|Not sure what all the raves are about - very poor writing, the writer repeats herself constantly.  Not nearly erotic enough, kind of childish, really.  But that's just me, you might love it.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|Good storyline and well thought out plot. Up to his usual Bosch novel standard. Is the American police system really this political?
B000001GS4|5.0|Love it. What a way to play a master piece. Such passion it is inspirational. Will recommend to others. )
B0015HOFZI|4.0|There are a couple of features I would have liked to have but how many can be packed into a piece of equipment at such a great price.  It does what I wanted it to do ... convert vinyl to digital with excellent sound quality.  I haven't figured out how to get the sound through my computer speakers, which would be very helpful, and since I can't hear the music, I can't stop it between songs with accuracy.  Consequently, I've been recording whole albums one full side at a time.  When I get time, I will work on both challenges.  BTW, it took two grown men and a 15 year old boy to figure out how to install the software.  The instructions aren't crystal clear but with some experimentation and intuition, we got the job done.  Bottom line:  I would buy it again ... it's as good as you can get for the price.
B00005LOUP|5.0|I still laugh when I watch this, nearly 13 years later! Ron Howard, Jim Carrey and the gang do a wonderful job! You will love every minute!
B004UOCF3W|4.0|Overall, its the Foo Fighters rocking harder than usual. Production is remarkable considering how hard they tried to &#34;keep it real&#34;
B000BB1MI2|5.0|Okay so this one I was really excited about when it was coming out because I am a huge Tim B. fan and I always thought that the character Willy Wonka needed to be a little more strange than originally portrayed by Gene Wilder ( although, for the time Gene did a fabulous job) Johnny Depp pulled it off beautifully and I have watched it several times since! If you haven't watched it, well you need to!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I got this on Black Friday for only $2 from Amazon.  The item was shipped quickly and arrived in great condition.  The movie itself is terrific and a great closing to a wonderful series.  Exactly what I was expecting
B003E48AYC|5.0|I have always been a fan of the Alice in wonderland stories and I have to say that I was a little nervous about this version I LOVE Tim Burton but still I was concerned because I love this story so much. But boy was I sooo far from disappointed! If you love Tim Burton this is going to be one of your favorites!!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I  DOWNLOADED THIS TO MY KINDLE FIRE-ITS ALOT OF FUN TO PLAY WHEN YOU WANT TO PLAY IN YOUR SPARE TIME.I'M NOT A EXPERT,BUT I JUST PLAY FOR FUN.MY GRANDCHILDREN PLAY THIS ALL THE TIME AND ARE WAY BETTER THEN ME.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I got the four hour chef as a xmas gift, and spent half of boxing day leafing through it. Fascinating and beautifully presented book covers so much more than just cooking. I thoroughly recommend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Well written.  I even went back at the end to reread how intertwined the story was.  It is a must read.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|great season for dexter lovers.  if you havent seen it, go watch season 1 and get hooked!  1 2 3
B0086700CM|4.0|Played for HOURS when I first downloaded it. On my old phone it used to stall a lot and that got annoying, but on a newer phone with more processing power it should be normal.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|my husband and i started this on kindle as part of our own bedtime routine.  fix dinner for us, our 2 yr old son, bath and bed for him; clean up and bed for us by 8pm.  so convenient, different and interesting as a series.  Michael Hall is a perfectly cast character for this role.  we're on season 3 and its still great.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Easy to use for hours of entertainment.  My grandchildren love it.  We compete with each other on the kindle to see who is best.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|great book, decent movie.  this is totally interesting and quirky - how could anybody not love it?  give yourself and ALVH a chance!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love keeping up with family all over the world .  with our busy lives it is so easy to keep up with family and friends .
B00633W614|5.0|This is a great book in a great series. Cannnot wait til number 3. Archer is one of my favorites.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|It got a little funny were characters are just showing up from time to time, like Arnold and Chuck Norris.<br />Didn't really feel the movie had a good plot it was kind of everywhere.<br />It did have allot of shooting and action if this is what you like.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved this book! I have reread it several times in the last couple of months and each time is just as good as the first time I read it. It will be hard to top this book... cannot wait until the Walking Disaster is out!!
B007G92QGO|4.0|Good story lıne and well created characters. I enjoyed the pace of the story and the endıng was a surprıse
B0044CBMVG|5.0|One of my favorite episodes in the &#34;Bones&#34; TV series. Bones and Booth go bowling to uncover a murder. I've always felt I'd like to meet real life versions of Bones and Booth. Great, albeit quirky, character interaction.
0679805273|4.0|It is a classic. Something that you need to have in your library. Unfortunately I bought this used and it had some writing in it, but it was very minimal.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Virtually every sf blog I follow has been singing Mr. Howey's praises over the last year and I see now this was with good reason.  When I saw that the first novella was available for free, I decided 58 pages wouldn't hurt me if things didn't turn out to well.  Howey turns what was originally intended to be a one-off set in promisingly dark subterranean silo into an ever-provocative adventure dystopia.  If you enjoy serialized, long arc television, the Wool series is perfect for you.<br /><br />Note 1: Only the first three stories can really be called novellas. After that, with page counts approaching and then surpassing the 200 mark, we begin dealing with a series of novels and I'm glad for it.  The extra pages contain no fluff.  It's evident that Howey simply has a lot he wishes to do with this story.<br /><br />Note 2: I've not yet read beyond this Omnibus because, on the author's own advise, I plan to wait until #6-8 are collected in Omnibus #2 in Spring 2013.  I am eager to peek into the prequel.

B0093FNZT6|3.0|Although I found a considerable amount of terms that were new to me, I am sure this book would be of use to those who understand the terminology better.  I am not sure how this doctor's experience connects with my beliefs, which are based on the bible, but I nevertheless found it worth reading.

B000VE439Y|5.0|I have always been a big fan of Monty Python and bought this movie just to have! Very funny and not for the faint of heart! This movie is not for the kiddos either!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I thought this book was very relevant in what kids go through these days in high school in terms of finding yourself. It was very insightful too read. I would recommend this book to any teen or young adult. The only bad part about this book is it used some inappropriate language and details.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|I bought this for my hubby! He loves action films and this was a great one to add to his collection. We actually bought number 2 not too long ago! Great movies!

B009IEXKXI|5.0|If you like science fiction (not the fantasy that these days labels itself science fiction) then this book is a must read. The book combines the addictive readability and unassuming heroics of Heinlein with the realism, knowledge and imagination of Clarke and Asimov.<br /><br />The main character tries to hide his brilliant intellect, amazing courage, indomitable cheerfulness, and touching humanity using an acerbic tongue and bad language but is instantly and intensely likeable. You cannot but join the entire population of the world in fervently rooting for him to overcome and survive the impossible odds that face him.<br /><br />Thank you Andy Weir. I will be keeping my eye open for your next book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. Started reading last night and completed it today. Fantastic and I highly recommend it for others.

B003EYVXSW|5.0|It didn't work out so well in Jurassic Park and it doesn't work out so well here, either.  The movie itself is enjoyable, and the two veteran leads (Polley and Brody) are up to the task of carrying the movie. It'd prefer to see more puppet or animatronic effects over that of cg but it wasn't a distraction. Basically, I bought what the movie was selling and liked it. As you're watching it, remember the phrase \\"Life finds a way\\" from Jurassic Park.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I recommend this to whoever likes a thrill and mystery, it is very fun and exciting and reading it on my kindle I just got got Christmas is just amazing!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I missed the first 2 episodes of Season 2, so I ordered them from Amazon.com.  Now the rest of the season makes so much more sense!  This is a great series.  I never saw the first season, but will be ordering that as well!
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Good topic, and the 2 lead stars are real pros.  Better couples watch it together, but if not, wife first.
0143119680|4.0|I think I enjoyed this since it was about a more mature woman vs all the young adult fantasy books.  Also, I hadn't read a lot of books on witches.
B000W9DTG6|5.0|Just check out the ratings on Flixter or other sites - The Ocean's movies are very entertianing and well done.  I can't get over the great mix of actors in these movies.
0307592731|5.0|This made me want to hike the trail.  Perhaps one day....however the toe nail thing was gross!  I went on to read another book on hiking the PCT by Skywalker.
B004WR125O|5.0|It is SO NICE to have wi-fi capability right out of the box.  Easy to config and perfect for getting signals across to the Onkyo.  I especially like all of the worldwide radio stations for free.  Excellent.<br /><br />I use my Blu-Ray player to stream anything that doesn't stream over the Onkyo.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I have never sat still long enough to complete a game in my life....until now. This hooked me from the beginning and I couldn't stop until I completed it. I highly recommend downloading immediately. I do not understand why people choose to complain about the price. I think it is wonderful that you can try before you buy...it states in the description that you can pay to open the rest of the game if you like it. It is a really nice game and very nicely priced. I'm off to download another awesome game from G5....great work guys....keep em' coming!!

B003YK42LQ|5.0|Great music. Bought it for my husband and he loves the whole cd. It's worth it to buy the cd.
B009LA1QW6|5.0|Being a Lana Del Rey fan for quite a while, even before the release of Born to Die, I was really excited to hear that Lana had a new cd coming out. At first, was skeptical, because her Born to Die was so epic. But I am so glad I got this. I was so eager to get it, I walked from my house to a nearby Target store the day it came out to buy it!!! Call me crazy:) So, I do have some faves on the CD. Number two, called American, is beautiful. The rhythm, beat, and sound of Lanas voice blend perfectly, and will surely be a hit track of the album. By far my favorite. Number three, Cola, is pretty racy and out of the blue with some of its beginning lyrics, but will become addictive to listen to, as it has a good beat and catchy lyrics. Number one, Ride, is a suprise track, which is calming and features the usual silky sound of Lanas voice. Body electric is also a great track, and features many clever lyrics from Lana, like 'Elvis is my daddy, Marilyns my mother, Jesus is my bestest friend', which is neat to listen to. I could sit here all day reviewing this, but you should buy it for yourself!!!! Lana just gets better, believe me. Look forward to more from her in the future. Buy and enjoy!
0345803485|3.0|First of all, I don't normally write reviews.  It will be painfully obvious that I am not a literary snob, and I am not into the the romance/erotica novels.  Since most of my reading is Dean Koontz or Stephen King, I will admit I know nothing of the subject matter.  That said, at least those authors do know how to write, and they write exceptionally well (in my humble opinion).  That is something you will not find here.<br /><br />Despite what other reviewers have said, I honestly neither loved \\"Gray\\" nor did I hate it.  As my favorite reviewer described, my vagina liked it.  My brain did not.  (Thank you for the biggest laugh I've had in a long time.)<br /><br />First the bad:<br /><br />It is very poorly written, and I too felt as though I was reading something from the mind of a thirteen year old girl.  (Ok, maybe fourteen.)  To be fair, I have read worse.  Some of the horror novels by lesser known authors, for example, are just plain horrible.  That said, this is pretty bad.  I could not get a good visual of the scenes or the characters as the descriptions were terribly lacking, and Ana's thought-processes are so simplistic they are literally mind numbing.  She constantly uses the same words and phrases over and over and over.  A thesaurus was greatly needed.  Now I did not mind the constant \\"Oh my\\".  It seemed appropriate.  However, \\"down there\\" instead of vagina is inexcusable, and biting one's bottom lip so often would lead to severe blood loss.  Actually maybe that explains why Ana's brain doesn't seem to function.  Eyes were rolling so often I'm surprised they didn't literally pop out of my Kindle and roll right off the bed onto the floor.<br /><br />There is absolutely no plot.  I kid you not.  It's all sex.  Now if all you want is sex, you can add this to your pro's category, but I tend to like a good story.  That said even the sex lacks the description necessary to really engage the reader.  I like the author to paint a very clear picture, regardless ofthe subject matter, and that simply doesn't happen here.  Ever.<br /><br />The absolute worst offender, for me, was the Inner Goddess.  Dear God, was that annoying!  I can't even describe how much I hated hearing about her.  What the hell is an Inner Goddess anyway?  It was non-stop with this other personality... \\"My inner Goddess is jumping up and down with pom poms.  My inner Goddess is dancing the hula.  My inner Goddess is touching her tongue to her nose and crossing her eyes suggestively.\\"  Meanwhile MY inner Goddess was taking turns vomiting and punching the crap out of my brain shouting \\"Why the hell are you reading this garbage?\\"  So yes, I hated Ana's \\"Inner Goddess\\".<br /><br />Now the good:<br /><br />Sometimes mindless entertainment can be fun.  If you take this for what it is, a silly book about sex, it can be enjoyable.  Try not to dwell on the writing, Ana's stupidity, or the fact that absolutely none of this could happen in the real world.  If you are a woman, read it to get horny.  That's pretty much it.  For some, I understand it's not going to do a thing.  I suppose if you read good erotica all of the time, this would be terrible in comparison.  I do not read erotica or romance, and therefore it worked for me.  I had to stop thinking, of course, but once I allowed my \\"down there\\" to take over.. well.. I could see the appeal.  (Sorry I couldn't resist.)<br /><br />So in conclusion I think my IQ took a serious nose-dive after reading \\"Gray\\", but it had it's moments.  I will read the other two novels and hope they are better.  If you insist on good writing, you will want to skip this book.  If you like your stories to be the least bit realistic, again, you will want to pass.  Looking for hardcore sex/BDSM?  You're not going to find it here.  If you just want some \\"vanilla\\" sex, I say go for it.<br /><br />Now if you excuse me, my Inner Goddess and I both have to urinate.

0743297334|4.0|The Sun Also Rises survives as a classic as much because of Hemingway's radical departure in writing style as for the content that made the book an immediate popular success in 1926. It roared into the Roaring Twenties and Prohibition, a generation reeling from the disillusionment of World War I and ready for liberation from suffocating Victorian social strictures and the existing cumbersome florid literary style.<br /><br />The Sun Also Rises  appeals especially to the young hedonist whose parents never \\"did it\\" in daytime and felt guilty if they did it for any purpose but procreation. The book gushes with drinking scenes that tantalized alcohol-parched Americans whose access to liquor had been severely restricted for years. The characters behave less like mature adults than kids who've just reached drinking age.<br /><br />If the appeal of booze and an airy new way of writing weren't enough, Brett Ashley, the female lead and possibly the first truly liberated woman in American literature, ensured the book's success. In the United States, women had in 1920 only just acquired the right to vote. And here was a beautiful mature woman enjoying unmarried sex with serial partners of her choosing while wearing a man's hat and short hair. What a seismic shock to conservative Midwestern values.<br /><br />Hemingway was only twenty-four when he wrote The Sun Also Rises. He'd barely begun to live. At eighteen he'd spent a mere five weeks in military uniform before he was injured, convalesced in a hospital and got sent home. How could a twenty-four-year-old who'd never even been to college know much worth writing about other than his war experience, which the book hardly mentions? Perhaps there's an answer in the way Hemingway hurled himself at life. Life excited him. He lived the hedonistic lifestyle for which so many post-Victorian readers hungered. But he also reflected on himself and the behavior of those around him and wrote about what he noticed.<br /><br />It's interesting that both The Sun Also Rises and The Great Gatsby are about young men  obsessing over beautiful but shallow women and were written at about the same time (Feb '25 for Gatsby and Oct '26 for TSAR) by two young men who were had been close friends.<br /><br />[May contain spoilers]Synopsis: Three expatriate American writers, Jake, Bill and Cohn, rendezvous in Paris before leaving on a holiday trip to the bullfight fiesta in Pamplona, Spain, accompanied by a beautiful British divorcee and her new beau, Michael, also a Brit. Jake narrates the story and is in love with Brett but impotent due to his war injury. She professes to be in love with Jake but they are not intimate. On the way to Pamplona, Jake and Bill go fishing and Cohn goes off to be seduced by Brett.<br /><br />In Pamplona there is a lot of drinking and misbehaving and they attend the bull-fights. Brett becomes enamored with a champion young matator, Romero, and seduces him. Cohn, jealous, confronts them and severely beats Romero, who must go into the ring the next day despite his injuries. Cohn also fights with the other two Americans. Brett runs off with Romero for an affair and a week later expels him and calls Jake to help her reunite with Michael.<br /><br />Jake's impotency is a twist that doesn't seem to have much purpose other than to neutralize the narrator by insulating him from being a full-on competitor to Cohn for Brett's affections. Jake's neutered status does pique the curiosity. Perhaps it stems from Hemingway's experience convalescing in hospital from the war injuries that handicapped him temporarily in bed. (Brett's complaints of being sexually frustrated may have originated with Hemingway's nurse and paramour, Agnes.)<br /><br />The Sun Also Rises  is about the emptiness of idle self-indulgence. Through the voice of Jake Barnes, Hemingway expresses his groping quest for meaning and morality. The book holds up the mirror to a group of misbehaving expatriates and says, \\"Here, look at yourselves!\\"<br />An absurd premise for the book might be that immorality is whatever makes you feel guilty:<br />[Jake, drunk and narrating] \\"...I wished Mike would not behave so terribly to Cohn, though. ...I liked to see him hurt Cohn. I wished he would not do it, though, because afterward it made me disgusted at myself. That was morality; things that made you disgusted afterward. No, that must be immorality.\\" Is this the musing of a drunkard or are we supposed to take it seriously?<br /><br />Throughout the book, Jake gropes into moral territory, reflecting the view that life is just a series of transactions, this-for-that value exchanges. This view appears six or seven times, on pages 34, 67, 78, 152-153, 156, & 237.<br />Brett (p.34): \\"'Don't we pay for all the things we do? ...When I think of the hell I've put chaps through. [meaning torturing men with her provocative sexuality] I'm paying for it now.'\\" [meaning she's the one now being tortured by denial of sexual relations with Jake, whom she professes to love, due to his impotency.] The operative phrase here is \\"we pay for all the things we do.\\"<br /><br />The values concept appears next during a string of scenes involving Count Mippipopolous (pp. 60-71):<br />[The Count] \\"'You see, Mr. Barnes, it is because I have lived very much that now I can enjoy everything so well. Don't you find it like that?' [He feels he's earned the right to enjoy life. He's entitled because he's paid his dues.]<br /><br />'Yes. Absolutely.' [Jake]<br /><br />`I know,' said the count. `That is the secret. You must get to know the values.'<br /><br />`Doesn't anything ever happen to your values?' Brett asked.<br /><br />`No. Not any more.'<br /><br />`Never fall in love?'<br /><br />`Always,' said the count. `I am always in love.'<br /><br />`What does that do to your values?'<br /><br />`That, too, has got a place in my values.'<br /><br />`You haven't any values. You're dead, that's all.'<br /><br />`No, my dear. You're not right. I'm not dead at all.'\\"<br /><br />Here the theory of life as a series of transactions, value for value, is asserted by the Count and Jake agrees. Brett probes for a weak spot in the theory, implying that love trumps everything, but the Count sticks by his assertion that suffering (he's been to war and is battle scarred) entitles one to appreciate the good life.<br /><br />The values theme appears next on page 78: [Bill] \\"`...Simple exchange of values. You give them money. They give you a stuffed dog.'<br /><br />`We'll get one on the way back.' [Jake]<br /><br />`All right. Have it your own way. Road to hell paved with un-bought stuffed dogs.'\\"<br /><br /> This is a minor repetition of the theme, hardly worth mentioning except as a reminder that sometimes the exchange of values may seem out of balance.<br /><br />Having prepared the reader, Hemingway next takes the philosophy of the value exchange much deeper on page 152:<br /><br />[Jake, narrating] \\"I had been having Brett for a friend. I had not been thinking about her side of it. I had been getting something for nothing. That only delayed the presentation of the bill. The bill always came. That was one swell thing you could count on.<br /><br />I thought I had paid for everything. Not like the woman pays and pays. No idea of retribution or punishment. Just exchange of values. You gave up something and got something else. Or you worked for something. You paid some way for everything that was any good. I paid my way into enough things that I liked, so that I had a good time. Either you paid by learning about them, or by experience, or by taking chances, or by money. Enjoying living was learning to get your money's worth and knowing when you had it. [emphasis added] You could get your money's worth. The world was a good place to buy in. It seemed like a fine philosophy. In five years, I thought, it will seem just as silly as all the other fine philosophies I've had.<br /><br />Perhaps that wasn't true, though. Perhaps as you went along you did learn something. I did not care what it was all about. All I wanted to know was how to live in it. Maybe if you found out how to live in it you learned from that what it was all about.\\"<br /><br /> The above passage includes an outright declaration of Jake's transactional theory as the \\"...exchange of values. You gave up something and got something else.\\" What could be more clear?<br /><br />Next Jake applies his transactional theory to the mundane act of reading a book (p. 153):<br /><br />[Jake, narrating, drunk]\\"I knew that now, reading it in the over-sensitized state of my mind after much too much brandy, I would remember it somewhere, and afterward it would seem as though it had really happened to me. I would always have it. That was another good thing you paid for and then had.\\"<br /><br /> On page 156 is another reflection on life as exchange transactions:<br /><br />[Jake, narrating about the peasants] \\"They had come in so recently from the plains and the hills that it was necessary that they make their shifting in values gradually. They could not start in paying cafe prices. They got their money's worth in the wine-shops. Money still had a definite value in hours worked and bushels of grain sold. Late in the fiesta it would not matter what they paid, nor where they bought.\\"<br /><br /> This is another minor reference to values, reinforcing the transactional concept.<br /><br />On page 237 the values concept is mentioned one last time before the meaning of the book is fully revealed in the denoument:<br /><br />[Jake, narrating, about being back in France] \\"It felt comfortable to be in a country where it is so simple to make people happy. ...Everything is on such a clear financial basis in France. It is the simplest country to live in. No one makes things complicated by becoming your friend for any obscure reason. If you want people to like you you have only to spend a little money. I spent a little money and the waiter liked me. He appreciated my valuable qualities. He would be glad to see me back.\\"<br /><br /> In the denoument, after musing repeatedly throughout the book on life as a series of value exchanges, Hemingway presents thirty-four-year-old Brett after her fling with the nineteen-year-old matador, threatening his career. She mentions repeatedly how good or \\"set-up\\" she feels after her conquest, which also destroyed Jake's dearly earned reputation among the afficiones of Pamplona. Her other sexual conquest led to fistfights among the men of her party, destroying their friendships. In this aftermath of destruction, Brett can think only of herself. (Beginning on page 248):<br /><br />\\"`You know,\\" Brett said, \\"he'd only been with two women before. He never cared about anything but bull-fighting.'<br /><br />`He's got plenty of time.'<br /><br />`I don't know. He thinks it was me. Not the show in general.' [meaning the fiesta they attended]<br /><br />`Well, it was you.'<br /><br />`Yes. It was me.'<br /><br />`I thought you weren't going to ever talk about it.'<br /><br />`How can I help it?'<br /><br />`You'll lose it if you talk about it.'<br /><br />`I just talk around it. You know I feel rather damned good, Jake.'<br /><br />`You should.'<br /><br />`You know it makes one feel rather good deciding not to be a bitch.'\\" [meaning she's done Romero the young matador a favor by making him leave]<br /><br />Brett has been going on and on to Jake about her affair with Romero and she's just reduced the entire \\"transaction\\" between herself and Romero to a one-sided evaluation of how good it has made her feel. It's been all about her, with no apologies for the damage caused by her narcissistic ego gratification. She then turns her attention to Jake and how good he could have made her feel if things were different: \\"'Oh, Jake,' Brett said, `we could have had such a damned good time together.'\\"<br /><br />  But Jake has wised up: \\"'Yes,' I said. `Isn't it pretty to think so.'\\"<br /><br /> From Brett's angle, life is a string of transactions skewed in her favor. She's drunk. Jake's drunk. What are we supposed to make of the musings of drunkards?<br /><br />The book ends in logical exhaustion. The misbehaving characters will keep misbehaving. Jake may have a clearer view of Brett, but there's no sign he'll not respond to her the same way next time.<br /><br />Brett seems quite pleased with herself, even though she's behaved badly. Is this supposed to prove the converse of the theory that what's immoral is that which makes us feel disgusted?<br /><br />The book presents a segment of society who have lost their moral compass and don't know it, nor do they seem to care. Jake is groping for meaning with his transactional theory, but he's far from reaching any conclusion.<br /><br />Jake, who mirrors young Hemingway, reminds us of Holden Caulfield in The Catcher in the Rye and John Galt in Atlas Shrugged, young minds struggling toward an existential paradigm. An identity. Atlas Shrugged gives a simple solution: to hell with Jake's \\"tit for tat,\\" do only what is in your self interest.<br /><br />But self-interest is in direct conflict what we are taught in the Judeo-Christian world: do unto others as you would have done unto you and love thy neighbor as thyself. Holden describes his angst arising from struggling for a value system that gives relief from \\"all the phonies,\\" the rampant hypocrisy of the adult world confronting him.<br /><br />Jake's transactional theory is a modest attempt at a personal philosophy, but he's much more like Holden than Galt, (both of whom were'nt around until the 1950s.)<br /><br />I was a little disappointed in the overall impact of the book, having read that it was Hemingway's greatest novel. I'd read three of his others and his memoir, A Moveable Feast, and over thirty of his short stories. I felt pulled along not so much by the novel's characters or plot as by my expectations, which were perhaps unreasonably high.<br /><br />The plot was circular. Like The Oddsey and The Canterbury Tales, a journey, an adventure. No great obstacle was overcome or goal achieved. The characters were mostly flawed and notably un-heroic. Jake, the narrator, seemed flat. He didn't share many emotions and he reported on the externals of the other characters with detachment.<br /><br />In the end though, by wising up to being used by Brett, he was the only character who changed. The narrative voice was the best part, authoritative, nimble, flowing like music. A pleasure to read.<br /><br />And so my rating:<br /><br />Memorable 4<br />Socially Relevant 5<br />Informative 3<br />Unique 5<br />Thought Provoking 4<br />Well Written/Expressed 4<br />Entertaining 4<br />Inspires Visualization 3<br />Sparks Emotion 4<br />Life Changing 3<br /><br />Total 4 Stars (39/10 = 3.9)s as you went along you did learn something. I did not care what it was all about. All I wanted to know was how to live in it. Maybe if you found out how to live in it you learned from that what it was all about.\\"<br /><br /> The above passage includes an outright declaration of Jake's transactional theory as the \\"...exchange of values.

Late in the fiesta it would not matter what they paid, nor where they bought.\\"<br /><br /> This is another minor reference to values, reinforcing the transactional concept.<br /><br />On page 237 the values concept is mentioned one last time before the meaning of the book is fully revealed in the denoument:<br /><br />[Jake, narrating, about being back in France] \\"It felt comfortable to be in a country where it is so simple to make people happy. ...Everything is on such a clear financial basis in France. It is the simplest country to live in. No one makes things complicated by becoming your friend for any obscure reason. If you want people to like you you have only to spend a little money. I spent a little money and the waiter liked me.He appreciated my valuable qualities. He would be glad to see me back.\\"<br /><br /> In the denoument, after musing repeatedly throughout the book on life as a series of value exchanges, Hemingway presents thirty-four-year-old Brett after her fling with the nineteen-year-old matador, threatening his career. She mentions repeatedly how good or \\"set-up\\" she feels after her conquest, which also destroyed Jake's dearly earned reputation among the afficiones of Pamplona. Her other sexual conquest led to fistfights among the men of her party, destroying their friendships. In this aftermath of destruction, Brett can think only of herself. (Beginning on page 248):<br /><br />\\"`You know,\\" Brett said, \\"he'd only been with two women before. He never cared about anything but bull-fighting.'<br /><br />`He's got plenty of time.'<br /><br />`I don't know. He thinks it was me. Not the show in general.' [meaning the fiesta they attended]<br /><br />`Well, it was you.'<br /><br />`Yes. It was me.'<br /><br />`I thought you weren't going to ever talk about it.'<br /><br />`How can I help it?'<br /><br />`You'll lose it if you talk about it.'<br /><br />`I just talk around it. You know I feel rather damned good, Jake.'<br /><br />`You should.'<br /><br />`You know it makes one feel rather good deciding not to be a bitch.'\\" [meaning she's done Romero the young matador a favor by making him leave]<br /><br />Brett has been going on and on to Jake about her affair with Romero and she's just reduced the entire \\"transaction\\" between herself and Romero to a one-sided evaluation of how good it has made her feel. It's been all about her, with no apologies for the damage caused by her narcissistic ego gratification. She then turns her attention to Jake and how good he could have made her feel if things were different: \\"'Oh, Jake,' Brett said, `we could have had such a damned good time together.'\\"<br /><br />  But Jake has wised up: \\"'Yes,' I said. `Isn't it pretty to think so.'\\"<br /><br /> From Brett's angle, life is a string of transactions skewed in her favor. She's drunk. Jake's drunk. What are we supposed to make of the musings of drunkards?<br /><br />The book ends in logical exhaustion. The misbehaving characters will keep misbehaving. Jake may have a clearer view of Brett, but there's no sign he'll not respond to her the same way next time.<br /><br />Brett seems quite pleased with herself, even though she's behaved badly. Is this supposed to prove the converse of the theory that what's immoral is that which makes us feel disgusted?<br /><br />The book presents a segment of society who have lost their moral compass and don't know it, nor do they seem to care. Jake is groping for meaning with his transactional theory, but he's far from reaching any conclusion.<br /><br />Jake, who mirrors young Hemingway, reminds us of Holden Caulfield in The Catcher in the Rye and John Galt in Atlas Shrugged, young minds struggling toward an existential paradigm. An identity. Atlas Shrugged gives a simple solution: to hell with Jake's \\"tit for tat,\\" do only what is in your self interest.<br /><br />But self-interest is in direct conflict what we are taught in the Judeo-Christian world: do unto others as you would have done unto you and love thy neighbor as thyself. Holden describes his angst arising from struggling for a value system that gives relief from \\"all the phonies,\\" the rampant hypocrisy of the adult world confronting him.<br /><br />Jake's transactional theory is a modest attempt at a personal philosophy, but he's much more like Holden than Galt, (both of whom were'nt around until the 1950s.)<br /><br />I was a little disappointed in the overall impact of the book, having read that it was Hemingway's greatest novel. I'd read three of his others and his memoir, A Moveable Feast, and over thirty of his short stories. I felt pulled along not so much by the novel's characters or plot as by my expectations, which were perhaps unreasonably high.<br /><br />Theplot was circular. Like The Oddsey and The Canterbury Tales, a journey, an adventure. No great obstacle was overcome or goal achieved. The characters were mostly flawed and notably un-heroic. Jake, the narrator, seemed flat. He didn't share many emotions and he reported on the externals of the other characters with detachment.<br /><br />In the end though, by wising up to being used by Brett, he was the only character who changed. The narrative voice was the best part, authoritative, nimble, flowing like music. A pleasure to read.<br /><br />And so my rating:<br /><br />Memorable 4<br />Socially Relevant 5<br />Informative 3<br />Unique 5<br />Thought Provoking 4<br />Well Written/Expressed 4<br />Entertaining 4<br />Inspires Visualization 3<br />Sparks Emotion 4<br />Life Changing 3<br /><br />Total 4 Stars (39/10 = 3.9)
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote with all my PC's, Android phone and Kindle fire.  It is self teaching and easy to transport your data.  I particularily love the ability to include 'attachments' or 'photos' with notes -- and feel it's much better with this feature than Microsoft One Note.  I also love how Evernote integrates with Microsoft Outlook for very easy transfer of Outlook items to Evernote.<br /><br />The ability to share notes (such as a shopping list) with other family members is a nice touch also.<br /><br />I was introduced to evernote by a co-worker -- and am sure it has many features that I haven't even explored.<br /><br />It's free, self teaching and convenient . . . need I say more?
B00APUYN0I|5.0|I chose this movie because I love Rebel Wilson and she brought it in full force.  Sure, there are a few plot holes here and there but it is a fun romp with plenty of laughs and some really great voices.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very good book! Anyone will like this book, it made me feel happy/sad/excited all at once. Definitely was a book I couldn't put down!
B005FISBTO|4.0|My daughter really enjoyed getting the sixth season, it completed her getting all the seasons so far, she just waiting for the next one to come out.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|Updated 1/2/2012: As of yesterday afternoon, this app now runs perfectly on our Nexus 7 (re: the issue mentioned below). I should mention, by the way, that the developers responded promptly and politely to our support questions and had an update ready to go shortly thereafter, which is fairly rare in the industry.<br /><br />As to the app itself: my girls love all the Dr. Panda applications, and they're especially taken with this one. The animations remain absolutely adorable, and the mini-games are fluid and intuitive; the bug-catching and the \\"danger\\" of dropping fruit en route to the basket actually keeps my older daughter (who's 8) mildly entertained without presenting any real stress. My youngest absolutely ADORES the game, although she's starting to wonder what sort of doctor Dr. Panda is, given his/her wildly varied career.<br /><br />---------<br />Original review: While we've generally loved the Dr. Panda apps, this one immediately crashes back to the \\"desktop\\" from the title screen when running (briefly, natch) on a Nexus 7. I'll update this if any software updates correct the problem, but until then don't trust the Amazon compatibility sidebar.
B003L77GRO|4.0|My daughter really enjoyed it. I also bought season 6 so she would have all the seasons up to now.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Even though I have already seen every episode of the original series, I love watching them as if it were the first time.
075669812X|5.0|My 11 year old daughter loves Ninjago so it was an easy decision to buy this book. This encyclopedia gives her all of the background information on the characters so she can hold her own in any Ninjago conversation! Best part is that is has the green ninja mini-fig.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is very addictive and fun. It is great if you are looking for a somewhat challenging puzzle that gets progressively harder throughout the game. I would definitely recommend this game.
B008M721MS|1.0|Call quality is really poor. Video and audio are both really choppy and it is NOT connection dependent, as it will work on both my iPhone and computer. Please fix this!!!!!
0345803485|1.0|I don't understand what the hype was all about this book. I thought it was poorly written. I tried to go pass chapter seventeen, but I found myself frustrated with no desire to finish the book. The writing lacks of creativity as the same ideas keeps reappearing over and over again. Believe me, ignore the hype and what you read about this book and find yourself something useful to read.
B008Z9L94O|5.0|five stars for the product<br />one star for Amazon shipping practices as of 12.20.12<br /><br />Got my vinyl reissue in the mail today. Listened to it straight off. I didn't encounter sound problems other people said they experienced.  Sound comes off clear and similar to compact discs according to my ear and my standard issue technics turntable and needle.<br /><br />The good: well worth the value, a couple of books, thick vinyl and the presentation is just beautiful, easily my favorite boxed set I own. Full color pages, and colored sleeved and imaged inner sleeves inside the sleeves (!). Really loved the presentation, the music and the fact it's on vinyl. A must have for Pumpkins fans. Very well done. The box itself is very sturdy which leads me to the bad.<br /><br />If you order it from Amazon directly, BEWARE. Luckily my boxed set arrived without defects but that was despite Amazon. They chose to ship this high dollar set LOOSE in a large cardboard box with nothing but a couple bubble air pouches. I can see on the plastic shrink how the set skated across the bottom of the box back and forth during shipment. The Amazon box was thin and had creases and was crushed a few times. The packing tape was cracked all around and only a few threads kept the packing box from opening outright.<br /><br />If Amazon had stuffed the packing box full of bubble wrap there wouldn't be a complaint. But as it was, there was only those couple bubble pouches, I consider myself VERY lucky. This heavy boxed set was loose in the box and could have suffered major damage including corner pushes not to mention seem splits to the inner sleeves. I was lucky and only the shrink was worn away but I live in a major city. If the package had to make another couple postal rounds to a suburban or rural area, I highly doubt it would have made it. I've boycotted GoHastings because they ship records in thin bubble mailers and records ALWAYS arrived very damaged. If I had known Amazon itself would be so careless, I would have ordered from another seller and not taken the risk. I was lucky.
B00384UCBM|5.0|A story about two women who need a break from their broken hearts and take a vacation through the Christmas holiday.  The plot line becomes a bit cheesy and feel good fairy tale, but that's why we watch chick flicks, isn't it?
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I just downloaded it but if you like his sound he backs it with good writing both words and music
B001E5CH0G|5.0|Elf isn't for everyone.  It's one of those movies that you either love or you hate.  If you are looking for a perfect plot line and excellent acting...well, this isn't quite your movie.  But if you want to laugh and enjoy a movie that boosts your Christmas spirit, don't be a 'cotton headed ninny muggins'...check out Elf!
B003SI9WYG|5.0|While I do not necessarily &#34;get it&#34;, my kids seem to love this movie.  My granddaughter has even watched and liked it.
0553384775|3.0|IN A FEW WORDS  NOT MUCH OF A BOOK.  POORLY WRITTEN AND MOSTLY TRASH.  JUST BOUGHT IT IN THE DARK
B003QSMCKO|5.0|My daughter and granddaughter both love this movie.  It is nice to see films portraying women in roles of leadership and strength.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is awesome!! It's really nice to have furring storms and see what the ten day forecast will be! I highly recommend this app to any one.
B000044TZU|5.0|Came in perfect condition and love this album, one of my favorites of Natalie Merchant, I never get tired of hearing it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I LOVE when a book is so good that you can't put it down not even for sleep. Thank You, Colleen Hoover !
B00ARAO0WM|5.0|I watched this with my husband and our 32 year old son and we all liked it.  Found it very exciting and interesting.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I liked this product.  I gave it as a gift but I imagine the film itself is still the same!  The presentation was spectacular though.  I really liked the box it came in, the &#34;book&#34; style container for the discs, and the design of it all was very nice.  This was a nice addition to his movie collection and it looks really cool on the shelf.
0486281523|1.0|I didn't like the set up or the problems or exercises. It's not very well written and frankly for an old reproduction of a book, Amazon is selling it too expensive.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I could not be happier with my Swivel. My mother had the older version for years, loved it so much~ she bought herself 2 this time, and one for me. Neither of us have had a problem with the battery at all. We charged it fully before using it, and did not recharge until the battery was completely dead. Haven't had any issues, I can run it through the whole house a few times before having to recharge. Gets into corners and under furniture with ease, light weight, and more powerful than I expected. This is the perfect solution for in between deep cleaning with my vacuum. I also prefer using this over a broom in my kitchen any day!! No more fly aways and bending over to attempt picking up the pile with a dust pan. Easy to clean too, I just flip it over, use a pair of scissors to cut hair/strings from the brush, and it pulls right off. Worth every penny!
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|I love my Lost Girls season one. I now can go back and get all into every thing that has happened. Anyone who loves the TV show will love having it to watch any tiime.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|For anyone who has moved away from somewhere and misses their local radio this is perfect....or if you are out of town and want to listen to your hometown radio.<br /><br />Quality is usually stellar (assuming you have a good data/3g/4g/wifi connection).<br /><br />Connect your phone/tablet to your car, home audio, external speakers, etc.... and this thing is brilliant.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The ending was terrible<br />And I can't believe that's what they choose to happen it seems sad and nothing resolves
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This is the quality of their earlier books.  Many things are answered from the Prendergast saga. You will not be disappointed.
B0073PPKNM|3.0|The lady sings well enough, but the cover sells the album. Case is cardboard. Your standard girl singer trying to sound sexy.
1419707663|5.0|Nephew loved them, Could not wait to start reading them, had to take them out of box so he could read right away!
1416550550|5.0|This was an interesting story plot. I gave this copy to my neice for Christmas, having read it several months ago. Character development was good.
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|This did not work - we tried everything - wasted about 12 bottles - did the hot/cold water, held over a flame and then cold water - got one good one...
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Awesome series.  Great characters, not too fantasy-y.  I gave the whole series to my father in law for the holidays.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought this for my son after seeing a couple of students of mine playing with one during free time.  They love it and so does my son.  I must admit that it's fun for adults too - quite addicting.  I'm a sucker for this type of test of skill and trying to outdo yourself.
B003LXSY60|5.0|I am not a music critic or even a musically knowledgeable person.  I like all types of music, but I don't have a preference for any.  This is one of the most listenable albums I have ever heard.  Most albums have at least one track that is terrible, but I can't say that about this album.  I can listen to this all day and not get tired of it.  After I heard this, I went on to purchase other Black Keys albums, but this is still my favorite.  Get it - you won't regret it.  If people try telling you that &#34;their older stuff is better,&#34; tell them to shut their pieholes, because I think it makes them more accessible compared to their older albums.  Yeah, it's more commercial (not as much as El Camino), but music is really about selling albums.  If being more &#34;poppy&#34; sells more albums, then it's a success.
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|Love the color, the fit, and the protection level. Easy to spot in my purse! The L-shaped zipper opening is also clever so the device can't easily fall out when case is opened.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Pop mastery.  This album is catchy, inventive, and is easy to sing along to.  After listening to OMAM, you're going to think, &#34;Oh, Man!&#34; because it's that great.  After seeing the video for Little Talks, I realized that every one of their songs could be a cleverly animated video/cartoon.  I'm just bummed that I missed them in concert.
B000VMBXNA|4.0|The ending left me wanting more of the book.  It's a great quick read over the holiday season.  I'd recommend it.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|It was great but I needed to rate it so I stopped getting suggestions exactly like it. So sorry friends.
B008G59IBI|4.0|Green Day finish their trilogy of albums, released within a few weeks of one another, strongly. \\"Tre!\\" is probably on a par with \\"Uno!\\" as the best of the three with \\"Dos!\\", like it's namesake, in second place. \\"Tre!\\" is a fantastic record for exactly half the songs on here. But what songs!<br /><br />\\"Dirty Rotten Bastards\\" is my favourite of the lot, coming in at six and a half minutes. Green Day have perfected the double, and sometimes triple, in length song started on \\"American Idiot\\" with \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" and \\"Homecoming\\", and \\"DRB\\" is a bit like \\"Jesus\\" crossed with \\"Minority\\". It's got this sea-shanty tune that opens and closes the song with this amazing riff and gorgeous melody running throughout. Mixed in are snippets of songs that range from the classic Green Day sound to the Who's \\"My Generation\\" sped up, and Mike does some utterly crazy things with the bass. I love it and can't stop listening to it.<br /><br />A close second is \\"X-Kid\\", a power-punk-pop song with shades of `90s staples Bryan Adams and the Stereophonics laid atop one another. It has this brilliantly structured sequence of the instruments coming in one at a time, first the guitar, then the drums, then all cascading wonderfully together at once. It's the kind of song I get goosebumps when it comes on. It's so damn catchy!<br /><br />\\"99 Revolutions\\" is very energetic and fun, it's the anthem for the Occupy movement and should've closed the album instead of the dreary piano ballad \\"The Forgotten\\". \\"Missing You\\" and \\"Walk Away\\" are the kind of songs Billie Joe's perfected over the years and made a fortune from writing. They're classic Green Day from the \\"Dookie\\"/\\"Insomnia\\" era and are just awesome. They're toe-tapping catchy, fun, cheerful, dance-worthy, upbeat and great.<br /><br />I wasn't as enthused with the remaining six songs. \\"Drama Queen\\" is an acoustic song and seems to be about whatever troubled actress is in the news (Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Bynes, etc.) and sounds a bit like an Oasis B-side from the `90s. \\"Sex, Drugs & Violence\\" is a pretty decent punk-pop song with some naff lyrics - they sing \\"sex, drugs & violence, english, math and science, gimme gimme danger!\\". Ergh.<br /><br />I won't talk about the others, they're good for a listen but I don't see myself going back to them much. But the six songs that stand out? No one else in the world could've written these amazing songs but Green Day and for these alone this record is worth getting. It's good to see there are no dodgy raps or songs about killing DJs on this record, and that Green Day have rounded out a solid triple album with one of their strongest collections yet. Proving they continue to make incredible music nearly 25 years into their career, \\"Tre!\\" is a must listen to for all Green Day fans.asis B-side from the `90s. \\"Sex, Drugs & Violence\\" is a pretty decent punk-pop song with some naff lyrics - they sing \\"sex, drugs & violence, english, math and science, gimme gimme danger!\\".

B008469DGY|5.0|Best golf game, I never even thought I would like golfing  but I love this game so much. If golfing is this fun I may need to try, the real thing.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I liked it so much I ordered a second one for my daughter. I highly recommend it, phone is very protected.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Purchased for my husband. I will tell you that these are so much cheaper than Beats and just as good. I tried on Beats at the store the other day and gotta say they are awesome but NOT $250 awesome. These I purchased for my husband as he records with Pro-Tools and has his iPod every where he goes. So these will last him quite a while. They came highly recommended from a Pastor friend who leads the Praise and Worship team as he stated all recording artists he knows uses them. So I do highly recommend them if you are looking to record in a studio or at home. The company sent them quickly and they were packaged great. Really happy with the purchase. If you find them for cheaper somewhere else be ware. They may not be new. Don't risk it and just buy these.
1250006341|5.0|It was everything I had hoped it would be.  It's a good reference to the culture and time the series takes place in.
B0081SPK0I|4.0|what's not to like...fun and easy to play....only complaint is that the game buffers sometimes and makes it difficult to play....i'd blame my connection, but no other app reacts that way on my kindle.
B000N4SHOE|4.0|I have seen other movies on Miss Potter's life. This movie did not mention all of the details of her earlier life, but I did enjoy it.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|EVERY TIME I GET A DECENT AMOUNT OF MONEY IN A MATCH AND THEN QUIT THE MONEY I EARNED IN THE MATCH DISAPPEARS!!! WHY!?!?!?!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Its a CD, what more is there to say, bought it as a gift for a Christmas present, came with in a few days after ordering
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Many questionable assumptions but we all loved the movie anyway. Be ready to sit for awhile. Excellent Catwoman in this movie.
B0014I4KH6|5.0|Its a CD, what more is there to say, bought it as a gift for a Christmas present, came with in a few days after ordering
B00AE2J5HI|2.0|This movie would have been much better without all the horrible acts of violence depicted. I spent 1/2 the movie looking away. C'Mon!
B00A9X9VAI|2.0|Directors try to make these movies too complicated.  The intent seems to be how they can out do other movies in trying to show their breadth of imagination.  I just want a plot and the movie to surround it.
1423124111|5.0|What a great book to own. Beautiful pictures and wonderfully written! If you are a Walt Disney World Fan like I am . you will adore this treasure of a book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids introduce me to this game while on a road trip and I am so addicted to it I can't put it down.
B00728DYRO|5.0|This book was awesome,and I should ask how this author(J.K.Rowling) thought about how to make it.I'm looking forward to the next book:)
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I thought it could have been a little funnier...but still very funny! Can definitely tell it is a seth mcfarlane movie...hints of family guy style comedy everywhere. Overall good flick
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Very helpful app. Love seeing how much more battery life I have especially when travelling. Just installed it for my mom's kindle too.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Too much hype for this movie.  It was OK, nothing more.  Interesting costumes and make up.  So, kudos to the make up artists and wardrobe and design departments.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Not a big fan of animated films usually, but this was a delightful surprise. All ages can enjoy the humor.
B008EQIEWS|5.0|If you love mythology and Sam Worthington, then you are in luck.  Handsome Sam Worthington continues this beautiful saga of Clash of the Titans.  The movie is full of action and adventure.  The woman is strong this time and worthy of her heroic counterpart in Sam Worthington.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It's a Really good book and that says a lot because I normally hate reading!!!!!! A+ good love story, great ending.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This is and adventure with a sexy bad guy.  I loved him so much, I almost wanted him to win.  I said almost, but not quite.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is filled with lots of different emotions, some painful and others just beautiful. I would love for there to be a sequel so we can see how their relationship progresses. They have lots of happy memories to make and I want to read all about them.
B0059XTU1S|1.0|I was looking forward to this. We went as a family for Christmas , my eighty year old mother, my wife and four kids -  our seventeen year old movie-buff came under protest.  Oh dear!  At one point when the trolls were discussing what seasoning to eat the dwarves with, I looked around, my mum was asleep, my wife was asleep, my daughter mouthed her favourite put down - `Fail'.<br />Why so bad?  I think the movie lacks an interesting narrative and a credible hero, as well as which, if you liked the Ring movies (which all my family did) you are very familiar with the special effects - when the dwarves are hanging from a tree over a cliff, Gandalf grabs a butterfly and whispers to it before releasing it.  We all know the eagles are being sent for, and instead of tension wondering how the dwarves will escape, I got irritated that the eagles might not show up on time.<br />The narrative is very thin, the scene where the dwarves arrive in Bibo's house and he is reluctant to join them on their adventure went on forever, the trolls trying to eat the dwarves, much too long. The stone giants reminded me of the tree-people in the Ring.  Ok, I can understand  the journey to see if the homeland is habitable, but only if the heroes are sympathetic.  I guess I didn't warm to the dwarves,  first there are too many of them - 13? , then they seem to have rhyming names - Bing and Bong, Ding and Dong, and none of them get killed (so far) so its hard to get invested in any of them.<br />The accents (for UK/Irish viewers) have moved around a bit - the dwarves seem to have Scottish or Northumbrian accents ( though James Nesbitt keeps his neutral Norn' Ireland accent) ; the trolls have stolen the Cockney accents that the Orks had in the last series of movies, and the Orks have now got so inhuman that they need subtitles.  This probably doesn't matter to an international audience, but it grates on me. Also Gandalf and Cate Blanchett are purely wasted in this movie.<br />Towards the end Bilbosays `I think the worst is over',  an almost soap-opera link to the next movie.  It is for me, I wont be back.
B0093WVND4|4.0|Movie Haas more detail. Good short story. I enjoyed it. I recommend it for others to read. High priced. Word
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Though some reviewers were annoyed by the sometime incredulous story, I found it to be thoroughly entertaining.  Allan's present day story is told in alternating chapters with his back story.  And what a story it is!  A very clever mix of historical situations along with his personal story had me grinning from ear to ear.  I did not want the book to end!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Amazing books! Highly addictive, you won't want to put it down! This is my second time reading them and still I am saddened when I reach the end.
B0058YPILY|5.0|I purchased the complete season one and I love it! I was waiting for the 7th and finally got it!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Keeps my kids out of my hair and quiet for hours... Was the first app they wanted me to download.  Going to be tough to get them back to reality
B000SVZIDA|5.0|However, the reason I purchased it was because I paid for a rental and that didn't work AT ALL! The movie started to play and then stopped. I have a highspeed connection to the net and new computer so it wasn't equipment related. In fact, upon making the decision to purchase the movie out of frustration, the download only took a couple minutes. Once I had the movie on my computer, the quality was flawless and I enjoyed the experience. I would highly recommend purchasing movie downloads from Amazon --movie rentals.....not so much :o(
B003L77G06|5.0|So there are already so many reviews for Modern Family, but I just had to add my thoughts in. Get it! The show is hilarious and the cast just works so well together. My husband and I enjoyed watching it because it seemed so real to the new kind of families of 2012. Not to mention my mother in law loved it as well.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Awesome read! The hero is definitely &#34;alpha&#34; in my book.  Although I find the relationship between the H/h to be a bit disturbing, reading their story is akin to watching a terrible car accident that is about to occur with that small sliver of hope that it may be averted, perhaps by the very drivers about to collide.  In any event, the sex scenes are HOT and inventive.  The characters are interesting and I like the plot.  I am very much looking forward to the next book.  So, five stars for me.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Read (listened to) this book with my 15 year old son and we both really enjoyed it. With all the talk about bullying these days it was nice to read a story about someone overcoming that kind of situation. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Really like the challenge.  Would like more options.  It kept telling me I had to get full version.  Will continue to try to play.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Overall Horrible... That is all I can say... Do not waste your money, not helpful and very hard to use
B007V65R54|5.0|This book presents the subject matter in a very accessible way but never sacrifices conveying the gravity of the subject matter. Nate Silver doesn't just magically conjure accurate predictions, he analyzes numbers. And, in his book, he explains why and where he's been successful doing that and why and where people have tried and failed. Again, it's not some special gift that's his alone. Simply put, Nate Silver explains what's going on and he does it very well. If you have any interest in this subject area, or even close, you should give this a read.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I installed this as a utility to save me time checking email. What I found was that it ran constantly and greatly impacted my battery life. It's also a little challenging to shut off. It kept coming back on. It's a good idea but bad execution. I can't recommend it until Yahoo creates a better version.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle has one of those amazing voices that anyone would enjoy. She is so talented . I recommend it for any age.
B0059XTUB8|5.0|Michelle Williams is a revelation as Marilyn Monroe. Williams has Marilyn's mannerisms and her voice down to a T. It's no wonder Williams' was nominated for an Academy Award for My Week with Marilyn. Michelle Williams has really impressed me with the last few films she has done, like Blue Valentine, Brokeback Mountain, etc. but it's her knockout role as Marilyn Monroe that really proves that Williams is a gifted actress, and it's so funny she got her start on that silly show Dawson's Creek! Kenneth Brannagh is fabulous as well as Sir Laurence Oliver. Great film, great script, and an amazing cast...I highly recommend it!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|After seeing the first episode at a local preview screening for the new season, it will definitely be worth owning . I recommend it to anyone.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I can't put into words how much I loved this book. This book made me have so many emotions. At times I will be crying for no reason then I'll be laughing then I'll be wanting to scream at the book. I highly recommend this book for anyone over the age of about 12 because of some of the content.
1250027624|5.0|I am glad to find books that follow the series more in depth. The writing is great and the show is definitely worth watching. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the show.
B009CPEOC4|5.0|This was a Christmas present...a favorite for Katy Perry fans...Arrived quickly and in good condition...recommend for those who like the &#34;life story&#34; aspect of an artist.
B001E7EONC|4.0|This movie had some unexpected developments that I was not expecting.  You never know what the consequences are dealing with a bad group of people by breaking into their safe deposit boxes.  I was happy with the outcome.  I am somewhat biased, because I enjoy watching Jason's movies.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book completely caught me by surprise.  I knew it would be good, because Colleen Hoover is amazing.  She develops a character like no one else I've read before.  But I wasn't prepared for just how much this book would affect me.  Sky and Holder had an undeniable connection from the moment they were on the page together.  Their connection was just there and I couldn't put my finger on why and how, until I finally could!!  AMAZING twist and Colleen Hoover did it with the perfect amount of emotion, grace, and compassion.  I absolutely loved this book and will and have recommended it to everyone I know.  Keep up the amazing story telling Colleen.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is lots of fun, and really makes you think, but once you figure out some of the key tricks it is almost too easy. But it is still addicting nonetheless!
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I love the movie and the book just upset that is all over with.  I wish that someone would at least do one more movie after the Breaking Down 2
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|best season yet! you have to watch this. ditto ditto ditto ditto ditto ditto ditto ditto ditto ditto ditto ditto
B002BWP49C|5.0|I love the movie and the book just upset that is all over with.  I wish that someone would at least do one more movie after the Breaking Down 2
B0027MJU00|4.0|A true page turner! This is a dark and twisted tale that is worth reading. I would definitely recommend this.
B003L77G10|1.0|Season One of The Good Wife was great.  Season Two evolved into a liberal political statement.  Pass on this one!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Great game, story line, etc.  The only problem I had was a lot of the time I would pick the object but it wouldn't recognize the selection unless I Clicked on hint then select the object for it to recognize the selected object.  This happened later in the game and became more frequent.  Other than that it is a great game!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I was in suspense until the end. I really enjoyed this book!<br />I never read court case novels but this one kept me turning the pages.<br />I would read it again. I recommend this book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't what I can without giving away too many detials but this collection of stories had me hooked.  Everything I look for in Scifi.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|What a surprise.  My husband had a triple bypass three years ago and the surgeon tore his aorta by accident.<br />They later told me that he was at death's door.<br />Later on that year and the next, my husband began having flashbacks. Some of these were from being under the influence of the morphine of course.<br />As I was reading the book and got to the part where the creatures were coming out of the mud, it rang a bell but I did not give it a second thought.<br />I asked my husband to read the book. He is a believer but a skeptic. We both are. When he finished the book, he told me about the same part. He remembered seeing the creatures coming out of the mud which scared him.<br />We believe that he did die but was brought back very quickly. And that the creatures in the mud are a transition from here to there.As it says in the book, he was at the lowest realm.<br />This book was an eye opener. We have read many books on this subject, but mixing the scientific with the spiritual, that did for us.<br />We recommend this book. It did not leave me with question marks and frustrations as many other books of this genre often do.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|So fun!  I would recommend this game to play with friends.  You don't really need to be an artist but I'm sure it helps.
B009329ZF2|5.0|This is one of the most interesting &#34;alien invasion&#34; on LA movies there is...it is action packed from the beginning to the end.  I think anyone with a sense of imagine would like this movie.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon for all the great variety of things to do with Amazon Prime and Kindle.<br /><br />Pat
B0081SPK0I|3.0|Took me back to the 1980s.  It's fun, but it wore off fast.<br />I'll play it from time to time, but nothing too exciting
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Because of the general story line, I wasn't sure how I felt about reading it. I did very much enjoy the book
B003L77G10|5.0|I love this show.  I watch it while I am on my treadmill and it helps me work for 30 minutes without even thinking about it.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|TuneIn Radio Pro is a nice application. It works as advertised. I listen a lot while I am at work. Only drawback is now I might have to increase my data plan.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This is a very goof book for kids<br />Good story and good writing skills tailled to the taste of kids
B008ELUEQC|4.0|Never really considered Rod doing Christmas, but is was pretty good.  An upbeat Christmas CD with familiar songs, I give it a like
B000PMG16U|4.0|If you love star wars then you;ll love this in HD. My kids love star wars and enjoy seeing it with a little clearer picture than dvd
B009VSW15Y|1.0|I purchased this app and it doesn't even work.  Look for a better camera if you are wanting to take pictures.
B009PAETCG|5.0|Very cool game. Challenging and fun to play. Hours of good entertainment. I recommend it for all you sports freaks.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love this version, my only complaint is the ads between each hand, usually they aren't too bad but once in a while you get ones that have to go through the whole 30 seconds. The game itself is great though!
B0095XPZBC|4.0|My favorite part of the whole season set was the round table discussion with the stars as they looked back on the show.<br />The digital mastery could have been a little better.<br />Overall it's something that every Star Trek fan should own.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|This is such an awesome series, so well done ... beautifully packaged ... I will watch over & over again!
B0049VZ222|4.0|Despite being yet another in the derivations on the &#34;I Am Legend&#34; story-type, it has some pretty good acting and scripting.  Good for any fan of the genre and probably a few on the fringe.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|Very interesting.<br />Not what you would normally imagine in a remake where they simply replace older actors and actresses with the more new version
B004EPZ084|5.0|This is an absolutely hysterical movie, the laughs never stop.  All the Actors in this movie did such a great job and I am sure most of them portrayed characters out of their comfort zone.  This is definately a MUST SEE!!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I gave this book a 5 star rating bug it deserves a 10. I didn't and couldn't put it down. Time travel, a love story, heroism, history all in one. I normally like mystery novels and just bought this book because it was free on my Kindle. What a wonderful surprise. Do not pass this one up !
B0015AARJI|5.0|me saco de los apuros del control, además muy buen precio. El envio de igual manera fue inmediato. No tengo quejas
B003YBNREI|5.0|Hey, its the Doobie Brothers, Man?<br />Of course its good.<br />Item arrived quickly and as described.<br />What else can I say?
B008TMA1LY|3.0|I like playing this game, and the visuals are adorable, but I very much dislike the fact that you have to pay extra for the other characters, including Hello Kitty herself.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|I wanted to see this movie for a while. Arrived in great shape, enjoyed the film.<br />No complaints. Interesting story.
1439196834|5.0|My boyfriend and I watch the show and naturally, I saw this book and thought how great it would be as part of his Christmas gift. It was a hit!
B002KDUDG6|4.0|I love Buble's voice and this is a good recording. However, it is mostly covers and I would rather have original music.<br />It arrived just as described.
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|[...]<br /><br />This is the first book in the Love at Stake series.  Roman Draganesti is a vampire and a scientific genius.  He is responsible for developing synthetic blood.  With its creation, he has been able to save millions of lives and develop bagged blood for vampires.  When one of his scientists creates a \\"real-life\\" blood bag made out of a sex doll, Roman thinks they may be onto something.  Once he bites into it and loses a fang, he realizes that it is not all it is cracked up to be.  What is a vampire supposed to do in the middle of the night with a broken fang?  Call a dentist of course!<br /><br />Shanna Whelan is a dentist in hiding.  After having witnessed a Russian Mafia hit that killed her best friend, Shanna was put into witness protection.  However, she has a bigger problem to contend with.  How is she supposed to continue to be a doctor when the sight of blood causes her to pass out?<br /><br />Roman shows up at Shanna's 24 hour clinic just in time to save her from another hit and in return she fixes his fang before he has to spend eternity with a deformity.  By helping Shanna, Roman falls into a confrontation with his long-time vampire nemesis.  Shanna doesn't understand what is going on at first and the feelings that Roman inspires are confusing.  Will she be able to overlook the stereotype to find the man that lies inside?<br /><br />I have read all of the series and enjoy them more everytime I read them!
B0072GPQNG|5.0|A really great film. Video arrived in good condition and as described.<br />The story was good. Horses can be really great actors; too bad they don't care about academy awards.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was a good read. I have been putting off watching the movie until I completed the first book. I am glad I did, because the books are always better than the movie remakes. :-)
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Its a great show. Better to watch it without commercials.<br />Item arrived just as described. No complaints!<br />What else can I say?
B009A9EQL6|5.0|I have waited over 10yrs for a brand new Aerosmith CD of original material and am rocked off my feet. This album is amazing
B003TSEEDY|5.0|There's not much more to say about this than the fact that this story is genuinely moving. It is a must read
B007THA4FI|2.0|I had never read any of Rowling's books. I saw in interview with her on TV and thought I would try this.  I just cannot get into it.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I gave this product as a gift. the recipuents were delighted to recieve this television series they do not<br />use cable tv
B0085A9J18|5.0|I loved this movie!! Awesome fight scenes that don't feel choreographed! Best martial arts movie I have seen in years.
B005JR47R6|5.0|I really dont know why you wouldnt buy this everyone should buy this its THE BEST TV SHOW MADE EVER.!!
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I watched this movie because the K-2 kids I work with all saw it and said it was funny.  Well, I would NEVER let a child watch this with all the terrible language and sexual situations - what were you thinking putting a cute bear in a near-porn movie??  The story line was predictable and nothing new at all - sorry but it made Mark Wahlberg look like an idiot.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This was a great buy! I have not been able to find this movie anywhere and found it on Amazon. My daughter loves the movie and I love sharing one my favorites with her. The movie came in great condition never before opened or viewed.
B007HU7NBK|5.0|As a long time fan of Duran Duran and especially John Taylor it was interesting to read the behind the scenes story of the bands rise to fame. If you are a Duranie you should read this book.
B0001I561E|5.0|This was a great buy! I have not been able to find this movie anywhere and found it on Amazon. My daughter loves the movie and I love sharing one my favorites with her. The movie came in great condition never before opened or viewed.
B00631VJIC|5.0|Great music. Love this series! The music is great and is awesome to listen to while cleaning :) Very happy!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Freaking great book !  Mitch Rapp at his best! ( although not at 100 percent)<br />Vince Flynn at His best!
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|Great movie, lots of action. It was just as good if not better than the others. Definitely worth watching especially if you are a Resident Evil fan.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|So much fun! Love the use of gravity. All the Angry Birds games are the top apps to have on your device. Hours of endless fun!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved every moment of this book. Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. Honestly one of the best books I've read.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book. The author transports you completely into Charlie's mind and makes you look at life from a completely different standpoint, which is inspiring and eye-opening. This book is outstanding because after you are finished reading it you feel changed, and that's what a good piece of art should do.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Wahlberg needs his brain examined... having accomplished other well-acted roles, to demean himself with the vulgarity of MacFarlane's warped sense of humor has diminished his capabilities in the eyes of our family and the majority of our associates. There is no one iota of social redeeming value in this trashcan flick... avoid like the plague unless you, too, reside in the gutter.
B003INBNXO|5.0|Best movie. Great fights. Awesome technique. Great great great. If you like martial art films then this is one for sure. Great buy.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|A niece recommended this series to me and once I started watching, it was very hard to stop.  Finished the series within a couple of days.  Have pre-ordered Season Two.  Only \\"The Wire\\" even comes close to this superlative production!
B007W8S2MG|5.0|In a generation where western developers have dominated the rpg genre with titles like Skyrim, Fallout, Dragon Age, Borderlands and Dues Ex, along comes a PS2 port with enough added content to almost be considered a brand new game. It reminds us that not only the Japanese rpg is not dead but it can contend with the best games of 2012.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I like this because it works like my PC. so I can bring it with me wherever I go and still get my email.
B009SQQRH2|4.0|This was great, but a very modern and hi tech take on how Santa accomplishes Christmas. I think older kids would appreciate it more than little ones. A good watch.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've never read anything from this author before this book, but I will seek out other books! This story was very well written. Throughout the book you meet and really get to know the main characters and feel their pain and happiness. Right until the very end the twists and surprises keep turning up ending leaving you feeling like all aspects of the story have been completed.
B00A1EOBJQ|1.0|I gave this album as a gift and the person was very disappointed that Fade Into You was not included.  I received the credit towards an MP3 of the song. The problem is that she has no way to play it in that format especially along with the other songs. I spoke to Amazon but they have no solution to offer at this time. I hope that the producers of the CD will offer the song in another format or reissue it with Fade Into You included.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|its a great app, does everyrhing it says, its surprisingly really fast and not laggy, very useful for when im lazy and dont want to get up
B00APUYN0I|3.0|One of those movies that has been talked up to death and by the time you see it you're wondering what all the hype was about.  Realize that you've already viewed the funniest parts of the movie if you've seen any of the trailers. It was entertaining (just) enough, and I gave it 3 stars because I couldn't give it 3.5 stars. It was actually better than I expected because the characters weren't silly or particularly obnoxious. They were actually pretty likable.  It wasn't a frat house mentality movie either. It's Glee (gone a cappella) in college.  It's worth a look as long as you're in the mood for this kind of movie (which I was).
B000HKW7E0|5.0|One of the best Christmas movies ever. I even watch it in the off season, I can probably quote the whole thing line for line.
B004P95A8E|5.0|I got this for my grandson who is Lego-crazy. He opened it for Chanukkah and quickly put it together as is his style. He has many Legos and this added to his menagerie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Highly recommended, enjoyed every page! Been a long time since I devoured a book this quickly. I bought it a day or two before Xmas, and finished it last night.
B000I5X81A|5.0|For people who like the blues such as myself this is a good mixture of JJ Cale and Eric Clapton!
B000WC39ZY|5.0|All good, great film. Watch it over and over. A must have film the sing is great in this film.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|Not much else to say here.  He's got a great, smooth voice and it's a lovely Xmas album.  I just think the &#34;All I Want For Christmas&#34; is kind of cheesy.
6305781427|5.0|Great to hear yanni at such a historical place. The orchestra was different...and I loved the violin duet. Great buy.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I thought this movie wouldn't be that great because the original movie with Arnold stunk but surprisingly this remake was so much better.. Worth the watch..
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It rocked like a lot. I loved it. And yeah people should actually read it. Wow. It was amazing. I want to cry because it is so good.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|This thing rocks! It's not flimsy like every other stylus, and its pretty accurate. I only wish it was magnetic somehow, so that it would stick to the side of my ipad mini.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Stephen King does it again! I really liked how the unlikely one turned out to be the hero! A must read!
B00365EVWE|3.0|First, I don't know why people give high rate for this product at JR. I bought this product from JR on Black Friday. It's $30. I use it to listen to music, but I found out this product has a problem. The bass is excellent. However, the mid and high are distorted. When I turn up the volume, I don't feel comfortable. The mid and high are too sharp. They seems at the edge.  They sting my ears. I studied Electronic before. I know the mid should be bright but not sharp. This earphones cannot be used for a long time. You should low the volume to avoid hurting your ears at the low volume you can use it for hours.. If you want to spend $30-40, don't buy this product. It's not worth $30.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|flow free is free and very enjoyable. it really get your mind in a twist sometimes, and it gets you thinking. I luv the application (app) I would recomend it for all ages.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|The game has wonderful graphics and soothing music that makes it a fun way to pass the time. It is one of my favorites.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was amazing but some what scary. I recommend this book for kids older than ten years old because of the violence .you need to read this book it was amazing because of the violence and Catching Fire in this series
B0042ESTQW|5.0|Garmin Edge 800 Skin Casing arrived exactly as advertised, and fits snugly to protect my Garmin Edge 800 wonderfully well.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|as usual i make my way into the appstore shortly after waking up to see the free app of the day. the pictures and the description made it look lame so i didnt download it. i come back later and im like wutever ill check it out and its pretty awesome! perfct hd graphics on my kindle . the levels r well thought out and challenging and its still fun enought to play over and over ! well done!
0425263916|4.0|Ok a little more smut than I prefer story line is good, Alot of sex, Just not 50 shades, close. Better than most steamy books
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like it so far it helps me pass the time n my kids seem to love it too its keeps them occuppied.
0425263908|4.0|Not too bad, alot of sex going on, a little too discriptive for me soom of the time. Story line is not bad. Pretty steam at times, which is good and what I was looking for. Good summer read on the beach.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|This completes the marvel movies I have.  Good movie and great special effects.  Having all the action needed.  Marvel has great movies and all the ways to view it in one package.
0785162348|5.0|The book was above expectations. Receiver was totally immersed  in the book Christmas day.  Great buy and really fastshippment.  Thanks
B008OOYALE|5.0|ok i already liked dragons before i got this but it made them better but if you have a kindle it will turn blue  but to fix it you hit the middle button on the bottom pull up and hit the back button then enter in again it works hope i helped  :D
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|how do i get the kindle fire to use the downloaded adobe app instead of the built in app to read a pdf file in my docs ???<br /><br />pdf files in documents ... if i select a document it opens in built-in app ... if i open the downloaded adobe app there does not appear to be an option to specify a document to open
B002JVWR9U|4.0|This is an interesting show and fairly entertaining.  Wish they would have stuck more to the storyline in the books and left the underage drinking, drug use and very underage sex (one of the characters is 15 when they have their first sexual experience and this is very illegal in all 50 states).  With that said and some appropriate age group and parental guidance this show is probably fairly tame for todays teenagers.  Should have based it around college age kids than the above mentioned issues would not be such issues anymore.  I would suggest reading the books first as with the popularity of Vampire teenagers now the 20 year old stories have been re-published and are easy to get.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|This was a wonderful movie.  It was great to watch it from my living room. Outstanding actors.  Worth renting from Amazon.  Easy process.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This book isn't your typical love story, that's for sure. But the themes of love, loss, and redemption run throughout this novel. The hero, whose real name we never learn, is on the run and lands on Bombay. From there he becomes involved and attached to a myriad of well written characters in very richly developed settings. Gregory Roberts does what every great writer does, he shows us instead of telling us. It's a long book and if I have any criticism it would be that it gets a bit bogged down in spots with unnecessary detail, but overall this is a very well written, interesting book with interesting and likable characters, vivid scenes and  something to think about when you're finished with the book. Highly recommended.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Both my husband and I enjoyed watching.  We have already watched several times.  I have enjoyed the Bourne series a great deal.  I'm glad to see more of it. Is there going to be more of them with this actor?
B0086213XW|1.0|....because a few hours spent stuck on the toilet will be less awful than watching this film.<br /><br />I'm sorry, and I hate reviews that say this, but I couldn't watch it until the end.  I just could not make myself do it.  Due to the wonders of my wireless Blu-ray player and Amazon Prime Instant Video I had to watch the opening 8 minutes 3 times in a row, so the boredom I felt over that 24 mins and the resulting 30 mins seemed enough to warrant turning the movie off before the end.<br /><br />I know we're all supposed to like arty films.  Films that show pubic hair and saggy abdomens and people who have been married for a while so don't have sex.  It's real life. It's gritty.  It's a sign of your higher intellect if you can watch and appreciate them.  But increasingly I find them abominably tedious.  Every time I heard Michelle Williams talking to that boy from Knocked Up in that voice, I just wanted to pull my ears off and shut them in my underwear drawer where they could enjoy the silence.  The irony was really that 90% of the parts I watched were largely unintelligible anyway - the mumbling was ridiculous and the pieces of dialogue I did pick up by having my TV so loud that when they shut a door on screen my house vibrated, were not worth hearing.<br /><br />I think basically, and again, I didn't watch the whole thing, but I was young not that long ago, plus I've seen a film or two in my life, it's about two people who (preposterously) meet at some place in Nova Scotia and then turn out to live across the street from each other in Toronto.  I can sort of believe this kind of coincidence because often I go to my local supermarket and run into people who live across the street from me, so why wouldn't the same thing happen at an obscure tourist spot in the middle of nowhere?  And then the idea that they would be sat basically next to each other on the same flight home is totally plausible, oh yes.  They share a taxi and do this weird thing which I suppose underlines their kookiness which looks like blowing in each other's faces, but is actually them blowing a piece of fluff.  How cute.  So then they want to get it on, but can't because she's married.  I have a feeling most of the rest of the film is them not getting it on, but wanting to and then probably near the end they do get it on.  During the middle bits I'd like to bet they do some kooky stuff (all the while her wearing some 50s-esque dresses and retro t-shirts whilst sweating because she doesn't believe in A/C (perhaps she has allergies?)) and perhaps there are more of the charming veiled mumblings between her and the boy from Knocked Up.<br /><br />All in all it's just not worth the trouble.  Putting the subtitles on so you can understand any of it will make you feel really old. And I doubt if you'll care about what happens to them, if they'll get it on, if she'll buy a better deodrant, why they feel the need to use the oven when they don't have air conditioning, all those things probably won't get answered.  It's just not worth it, that's my opinion.  Sit on your couch, have a cup of tea, clip that annoying cuticle that's been bothering you, just don't try watching this tedious, awful film.  That's my advice.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|I didn't have this CD and it had La Vida Sin Amor which I think is a fun song, so of course I needed to get it!

B009JBZH54|5.0|this trilogy is the best of batman movies, and personally i love it &#34;The Dark Knight &#34;. I am very happy for this buy
B003PIUC02|5.0|I do not like the series, but this is the best of many series at this time. The final is tremendous and the evolution of the story is very interesting
B0072OFOM6|5.0|the first and the second season are very good series, but is a shame the death of the first actor. Both seasons have good pictures, good stories and very very good scenes

B00APUYWYA|5.0|Loved this movie. Very funny while carrying a love story. I also like the subtle jobs at Glee. Highly recommend.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|This is one movie that I had to buy. It's one of those movies that's always good to watch when there's nothing else to watch.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I gave up on this movie with about a half hour remaining.  Would that final half hour have redeemed the film?  I doubt it.  I enjoy Family Guy, so even though I wasn't feeling confident after the preview, I rented the movie, figuring there would be at least a few laughs.  And there were.  There were about as many laughs in Ted as there are in a 22-minute episode of Family Guy, about 3-4 genuine laughs out loud.  The rest was a mess of &#34;clever&#34; bits that weren't so clever and vulgarities that forgot to be funny, as if McFarlane was so excited to write for an R-rating that he felt the need to indiscriminately cram as many in as possible.  His cutaway vignette style, so often used in Family Guy and forced into this movie, does not translate well to live action film.  I really wanted to enjoy this movie.  If it had been 20 minutes long, I might have.  Joel McHale is standout as the smarmy boss, Mila Kunis is believably long-suffering, and Mark Wahlberg does his best, but I think he was miscast.  I won't rule out seeing another film from McFarlane in the future, but he will have to prove that he can do more than make the same joke over and over (eg: a teddy bear says something surprisingly crass!) to wring more enjoyment from me.
B00A7ZXDLQ|3.0|it is what it is.  Ri-Ri has some hot beats and some memorable tracks but I'm not so much into all of the pop techno.  Her last 2 albums were a better mix.

B00A4TKDKY|4.0|***CAUTION*** Vulgarity included. Let's talk about the CD. ? Does this CD capture the experience of a live Buddy Guy show...NO. ? Does this CD give a glimpse into a genuine Buddy Guy show...YES. I own ALOT of live material of Buddy including four of the 2 - disc Pirate Cd's from 2004 Live @ Legends, and almost all of them are better quality than this CD, BUT, you can't purchase those any longer and any Buddy live is better than no Buddy live at all. The studio tracks that are included on this new disc didn't make the \\"Living Proof\\" release, but are truly some of the best studio recordings of Buddy's career.<br />If inappropriate language truly does offend you but you would like to hear Buddy \\"Live\\" purchase \\"Stone Crazy\\" on Alligator Records. It's not listed as a live album but has the vibe and catches Buddy at his rawest without being offensive. Buddy Guy Real Deal \\"Live\\" CD with the Saturday Night Live band is highly rated but, for my money, is the worst live Buddy CD I own.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This cover is perfect for my new Kindle Fire. I looked at other reviews first and it is everything  that was said about it. The fire fits securely in the case, and the cover is strong yet light weight. I like that you can hook the cover in back when reading and because it is a wider band it is easier to secure then the band on my old Kindle cover which began to stretch out after 4 years of use. Basically this cover gives you a lot of &#34; bang for the buck&#34; and I highly  recommend it.

B0013TXA5Y|4.0|It's expertly written. It's no Stephen King. But it does grab your imagination and take you for a ride. Other the one not so passionate kiss, it's completely pg. In other words, I would let my kids read it.

She's now on my Best Authors list.  This is truely a masterpiece of emotional understanding by the author, and I'm sure it will leave all readers with the gift of insight into some aspect of their past or someone they know.<br /><br />I just wish Colleen Hoover could pen her novels quicker.

B00APUYWYA|5.0|This is kind of a &#34;Glee&#34; rip-off, but if you like &#34;Glee,&#34; you'll like this, too. It's a predictable formula. Protagonist arrives at a new school, attending under duress. She has no interest in anything or anyone there, but a wisecracking guy has an interest in her. She hates him of course. Meanwhile, the existing campus girls' singing group is decidedly uncool and dominated by a manipulative shrew and her dedicated minion. The protagonist is persuaded to join the girl group, turns out to be the most talented among them, and leads them to glory. The wisecracking boy joins a competing group, mainly to be close to the girl, and also vaults quickly to become their leader. The girl group is mostly dysfunctional through the entire movie, but comes together in a lovefest at the final competition and wows the audience. Wisecracking boy has a new appreciation for the talents of the protagonist (did I mention that they're both fabulously good looking and have wonderful, trained voices?) and congratulates her on her achievement. She responds by sucking his face off. This sort of thing happens to me all the time.<br /><br />I've watched the closing musical number about ten times, but I'm like that.

B00979JSZ8|3.0|As a self proclaimed Downton Abbey fan I was greatly looking forward to the 2012 Christmas Special, particularly as the 2011 Special was probably the best ever Downton episode.  However, sadly I have to say that compared with what we have become used to this was really rather a disappointment and certainly an anti climax.<br /><br />The episode is set in September 1922 about eighteen months after the end of Series 3.  The  Crawley family accompanied by a few servants, travel to Scotland to visit their cousins.  Meanwhile the rest of the staff are left at Downton under the watchful eye of Carson.  However, for a large part of the time nothing much of note really occurs and for me the main interest is in the stunning Scottish Highland scenery.  Certainly things happen, but they are not very significant in the greater scheme and 93 minutes was beginning to seem much too long for this episode.<br /><br />Right at the end there is a very dramatic event.  I will not give out any spoilers on this although at this point it has been quite widely publicized.  This was very hurried so it will be interesting to see how it is picked up in the next series - in the immediate aftermath or after an interval of some months.  In any case I thought it was not handled very well and did not come near to redeeming a below par Christmas Special.  The program certainly did not leave you on a high on the evening of Christmas Day when it was first broadcast.<br /><br />I am sorry to be writing a less than glowing Downton Abbey review since what has come before has been so good, and it has been amongst my favorite programs.  Series 4 and the 2013 Christmas Special have already been announced so let's hope that these may return to the standard that viewers have enjoyed so much because unless they do, I do not think we will be seeing many more series.<br /><br />This episode will very likely be included with the Series 3 release in the USA.  Certainly the 2011 Christmas Special was included with the Series 2 DVD in the USA, but not in the UK.  Hence it is not worth ordering this separately.the Series 2 DVD in the USA, but not in the UK.  Hence it is not worth ordering this separately.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|This soundtack is spectacular...every song is great..as good as if you were watching every espisode of the show..the only problem  there isn't enough songs..
B002O3Z4QQ|1.0|I give this one star not because of the series - that easily rates 5 stars or more - but because the info for this version says it is in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio.  The box is labeled 16:9.  I already own the Signature Edition, which is also 16:9, but I was hoping to get a copy that was produced like the original series - in 4:3!<br /><br />If you don't care about what the producers did to the video to make it \\"widescreen\\", by all means, this is TV at its very best and I cannot recommend it highly enough.  But if you're expecting 4:3, look elsewhere.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a brilliantly written book that leads you to & through every emotion you could ever experience by simply turning the page! LOVED IT!!!
160774273X|5.0|Results were excellent from my first loaf. So much easier than other artisan breads with better results. Book format flowed well, unlike some others which force you to flip back and forth between photos and instructions. Overnight white was light with large holes and wonderful crust. Author's method works well for the home baker who has other things to do than set aside an entire day for folding and rising.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|A very interesting book, well written from a different perspective. I'm not sure I would make a movie out of it, kind of a downer.
B005LAII12|4.0|This movie is hilarious despite all the funniest moments having been in the trailers.  They do a good job of editing the trailer so there are still a few surprises.  It was like watching a live action movie version of an episode of The Family Guy.  Very funny movie.  I didn't give it 5 stars because for one, the trailers kind of give away too many of the funny parts.  Two, Mark Walberg sort of over does the Boston accent which is odd because he's supposed to be this Boston home grown star.<br /><br />Definitely worth seeing but so much prfanity please don't let your youngsters watch it.<br /><br />Update: so after watching this movie (I have the unrated version) a dozen more times (always hilarious) I realized that the part that I thought was a bad editing mistake was actually intentional.  There's a scene where Mark Walberg's character John is ipersonating Ted talking to him.  I thought \\"John\\" called Ted John but it was John talking to himself as Ted in Ted's voice to illustrate that Ted sounds like Peter Griffin.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|i would want to go back to the movies to see again, and again.  Now I can do so at home whenever I wish.<br />Love this movie enough to watch it over and over.  I can relate.

0812982622|3.0|I picked up this book after hearing the author interviewed on NPR, and read it on my holiday break. While the story is fairly compelling -- you do want to know what happens to the protaganist -- the book's mechanics were disjointed, and not in a way that helps the reader 'feel' the insanity that is North Korea. The 'loudspeaker' narrative works pretty well, but even this was unpredictable -- sometimes foreboding, sometimes a recap, sometimes seemingly unrelated to the plot at that time. Overall, the narrative is choppy, and while it could be argued that this mirrors the theme, it was not artfully handled.<br /><br />Additionally, there are details that the reader wants to know -- what happens to the aged retirees if they are not on the beach painting with watercolors? -- that are never answered. Are they harvested for their organs? Are they, too, bled out? We never find out. And for the bleeding, I heard the author describe that this was a literary device for an ending that was much more gory. But it seems that this should leave an indelible mark with the reader as a metaphor for the draining of the life-force of the Korean people. It is simply not developed enough to do the trick. I know that this was the author's intent, but it is like a faint watercolor, and I wanted a bolder statement.<br /><br />The scene with the interrogator's parents was probably the most vivid for me, but even here, I wanted more -- I wanted the parents to vehemently denounce their son for speaking of things that should not be verbalized. Or, I wanted the son to shake his parents free from their dogma. Neither happened and the scene just fizzled.<br /><br />There is real bravery, I'm sure, in North Korea. There is real pain, real angst, and real humor. Just like everywhere -- even when humanity is forced to hide its real face. This book falls short of demonstrating much except that Kim Jong Il was indeed a crazy, vicious dictator.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|The graphics are nice, but the clicking is such that when you zoom you end up getting penalized. I decided to just turn off the timer and the game was quite a lot more enjoyable. The dialogue is cheesy, but that's to be expected in a game like this. The puzzles and searches were challenging without being infuriating and hints were really available. I'd recommend, but only if you already like the hidden object style. Not a good game to get your feet wet if you're new to the genre.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|We gave this to our boys for Christmas before a 4 hour car ride--they also got the regular one.  They played with them while packing and for most of the drive.  They even played with it in the hotel.  Nice things are no batteries, little noise, and no pieces to lose.

B0012GMW3Y|1.0|One of my favorite Byrds albums. However this reissue, like so many reissues, loses all of the tone of the original album. This was a groundbreaking album in some respects, one of which was the use of brass on a country rock album.  Unfortunately on this reissue all you can hear on some songs is the brass. Horrible remix. I'm afraid this is another great old album that is lost forever in the remix/remaster machine.

B007LB5MF4|5.0|This is the first graphic novel I've ever read. I'm not really a fan of this genre but I took a chance since I loved the books. I really enjoyed it. They did a good job of parsing out the pieces that made a coherent story out of the epic length novel. I didn't see the HBO version so the only vision I had of the characters and scenery was the one in my imagination. This did not disappoint, even when the artists vision was different than mine. It is well done and the colors really bring it to life.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|This was a great product. It arrived on the day that it was supposed to. I purchased 2 DVD copies and they both came in the same box.  I love this version of the movie.

If you like the Kate Maberly version I highly recommend getting this product. It was unopened when I received it new.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I read this book in 4 days which is pretty fast for me. I had a hard time putting this one down! If you are someone who enjoys a book full of suspense and keeps you guessing this is a must read for you!
B000SW2F8K|1.0|I like Penelope Cruz and the plot idea could have been cute, but the film was too over the top to be a true romantic comedy.  It has too much farcical humor, poor graphics and terrible scripting to be much fun. I kept waiting for the film to redeem itself, unfortunately, it never quite did.  I'm just glad it was a prime rental.
B008C20TDG|2.0|Not much new information. Most of the information I already knew and putting together a meal from this book would be uninteresting at best.  Not recommended.
B002OFWG7O|5.0|A favorite CD, love the group!  Fillll  lllll lllllll  lllll lllll lllllll lll llller fillerrrrrrrr rrrrr rrrrrr rrrrrr rrr rrrr
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I wasn't. quite sure about this at first but I am hooked!  It's fun and so far no technical problems. I recommend it if you enjoy puzzle-type games.
030758836X|4.0|I would read this book again and understand somewhat why it has been so popular.  It is not uplifting; it is difficult to decide which is the villian.  However, after first chapter, I was hooked!!!
0743539133|5.0|GREAT BOOK, GOOD READING.  DORIS IS O.K. FOR A RED SOCK FAN!  great basis for the movie.  they should have used more of the book.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Well written and entertaining, Taubes for President! ...I've read it three times! (not sure why, just like the topic)<br /><br />It is my contention that Gary Taubes, Robb Wolf, and Mark Sisson are the three places to stop before reading anything else, or after reading anything else for that matter.<br /><br />Smart way to spend 6 months:<br />January: read Why We Get Fat<br />February: read Primal Blueprint<br />March: read The Paleo Solution<br />April: reread Why We Get Fat<br />May: reread Primal Blueprint<br />June: reread The Paleo Solution<br /><br />Congratulations you have just earned your black belt!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just like playing with a deck of cards but faster.Easy to use in the car and am sure a lot easier on a plane.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I enjoyed it.  I would have liked more happy ever after but a glimpse was good enough for now.  Maybe the screenplay will make it better
B004LWZWGK|5.0|A wonderful Christmas present with all the bells and whistles.  It arrived on time, just like you advertised.  It is enjoyed by the family and friends.
B0001I561E|5.0|Bought this for my 6 yr old nephew since he had never seen it. Was so nice seeing it through his eyes all over again.  My favorite Disney movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hooked from the moment I began reading and found it very hard to put this book down!  I can't wait to read the next of the series.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|If you love this series as I do, you can't go wrong. Great writing, great acting..so much more than a &#34;teen show&#34;. I'm in my 30's and cannot get enough.
B008QOFOQW|5.0|The lego came on time with no damage to the packaging.  The product itself was assembled by my 9 year old in less than an hour.  She loves the set.
B004LROUNG|2.0|Grisham's original books were exciting with well developed characters. That was a long time ago. I stopped reading his books because they seemed to be getting worse and worse. He was just pumping them out without much care. I thought I'd give Grisham another try with this book. Bad choice. This was incredibly boring both as to the characters and the plot. Save your time and money.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I have this app on my first kindle and love it! Just received the new kindle and find it is not compatible. Please fix this. None of the other products I found can even come close to measuring up to this one!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Very sturdy, bright and pretty...feel the Kindle Fire is well protected with this cover.  Thank you for making this item an option for purchase.
6305558175|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. Richard Gere and Jodie Foster were amazing with excellent chemistry, making this one of my favorite love stories of all time. The music is so wonderful, I bought the soundtrack CD also..
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book was riveting from cover-to-cover.  It did not dwell on the negative aspects I found in &#34;One Shot, One Kill,&#34; for example.<br /><br />This is a motivational book that shows that Chris and his fellow Seals just reek with integrity.  Now, if a few would run for national office, we might have a government noted for its integrity and not scandals . . .<br /><br />Buy the book.  You won't be disappointed!
B007THA4FI|5.0|a great story of various characters and their secret lives.  the story of haves versus havenots in society.  the psychological thinking of the main characters was interesting.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very interesting turn of events caught my attention, I would definitely recommend this book to other people , as I said it is one of my favorite books.
B009O2XY12|5.0|My new kindle was a christmas gift, so I was new to playing games. One of my first and I am hooked
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This app is great! I highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys the angry birds series! it's awesome. The only issue I have is that you have to buy the bonus Dagobah levels.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Good mahjong app. A little hard to see sometimes with a small screen but otherwise still a great app. Its entertaining.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|MY WIFE DOESN'T WATCH THIS, SO I PURCHASED IT IN THE FORMAT I CAN RETRIEVE ON MY COMPUTER FROM AMAZONS CLOUD MEMORY. IT ALLOWS ME TO WATCH ON LARGE COMPUTER SCREEN WITH HEADPHONES AND NOT BOTHER MY WIFE. gREAT CONCEPT.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you liked Fifty Shades of Gray and was sad after you finished the thrid one, the crossfire series will feed your appetite for a while.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This cable provides the charging ability for my kindle as well as a few other devices. I am very pleased that Amazon's devices use a universal cable.
B009186E3O|5.0|A Christmas gift for a huge Rolling Stones fan - could not have done any better (maybe London concert tickets!)
B007712XAU|5.0|I had been told that this was an excellent series but it has exceeded my expectations. The setting is spectacular and the acting and writing is superb.
1936608898|5.0|Loved this book from start to finish.  it has a real world approach to eating paleo.  dallas and melissa are great and bring a &#34;real&#34; touch to the writing of this book.  I have let 3 friends borrow it and they agree.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book honestly taught me a lot of things about life. And I will defiantly be reading it again soon!
B008CPZNL6|4.0|Nicely organizes things I'm interested in learning more about.  It introduces me to things I might not choose to surf the net to find.  Very convenient.
1932100385|5.0|Every medical doctors should read this and wake up to the reality of their failing treatments on their naive patients.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|ý10 freaking stars for Hopeless wow that was an intense story and the twist were ones I did not see coming just when you think you know the reasons/connections/\\"truth\\" i was in shock for most of them and in tears for the other part of it wow what a book she is an amazing writer I loved Slammed and POR as well; Holder is hot/intense/romantic/loving I want him for myself ;)
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Book 2 is a good story with many different characters, but I found the book to be an annoying read, due to many historical errors and impossible circumstances.<br />I really enjoyed the characters, especially Maud and Boy. Both are flawed and very believable. The descriptions of the homes and lifestyles of the characters add to the book, but I found it annoying that much of the “historical” detail was incorrect. For example his description of the Naval Battle of Midway is wrong, at no time were the three USA aircraft carriers together, they fought as two separate units, as USS Yorktown departed Pearl Harbour late, and never caught up with USS Enterprise and USS Hornet. The description of USS Yorktown’s gunnery weapons is incorrect, as Yorktown was never fitted with the twin 5 inch twin turrets that became standard on US carriers later in the war. His description of the signals operation aboard the carrier is also completely incorrect, as the tasks were highly compartmentalized.<br />The most ridiculous item is that the code breaking was Ultra Secret and was not common knowledge until the 1970’s. No one was allowed into the code breaking facility, and the idea that people, even Senators, received tours is simply laughable. Also the idea that code breakers who operated in the secret location would be transferred to a combat role is ludicrous. If a code breaker had been captured and interrogated under torture the whole code breaking operation would have been doomed.<br />The German High Command would never have sent a top secret war plan via a junior officer on foot. Even if this had happened, said officer would simply have used his Luger pistol to kill his three female assailants. Ditto a Russian General would not have been stopped by some workers at a road block; he would have shot his way out of the problem.<br />The coincidence of his characters meeting time and time again becomes tiring.  I could give many more examples, but you get the idea.<br />Despiteall this, I will be buying Book 3 as soon as it becomes available, I just hope that Book 3 does not repeat the mistakes of Book 2.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Easy to organize my emails the way i want to see them (New emails are at the top).  I like it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read the entire book in 12 hours. I was mesmerized and couldn't stop. I can't wait to read the next book.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Enjoy the book  but it got too technical for a lay person ( meaning not a doctor or scientist). but once you get beyond that part is is terrific
B00APUYWYA|5.0|We loved it.The singers were outstanding.It was funny and very entertaining.My daughter watched it twice in less than twenty four hours.
B000LAZDQA|4.0|Not really sure of<br />I gave this is a gift<br />Reasoably price Will have to ask the receiver of this gift what they thought of it
B000002J0P|5.0|as with all CSN and CSNY all of thewir music is classic for the ages. It's music that you never get tired of listening to.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Great read. Not as fantasy as many would think. More like a mix of politics, human tendencies, and fantasy. Classic writing style coupled with old English terms makes for a well-written and interwoven story. Can't wait for what's next!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Always fresh and exciting!  I am definitely addicted.  I hve found many useful things to try and have done them!
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|This product was good, I highly recommend it, especially for the low price and great quality . Thank you thank you
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Oh my Gosh, this has to be one of my favorites. I was absolutely taken away by the story line. Colleen Hoover definitely out did herself with this one. It had love, romance, hate, terror, kindness, funniness, and extremely traumatizing emotional aspects to every turn of this story. I am completely speechless over this story. Well done! It is amazing!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The hunger games trilogy had me on edge through every page. Definitely a good read and would recommend it to anyone
B005LAIGSM|5.0|Two of my favorite stars of the day:  Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum.  Inspired by a real life story of the people who went through it.  I saw the real people interviewed on a talk show and this movie truly drove home their love story.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|Good but not her best very easy listening  if you like Susan Boyle you can't go wrong  she just seems to sound the same in all her songs
B0094BB4TW|1.0|this app is not good because what if a stranger gives you a text and then write bad stuff about you if you were me do not buy this. Please!!
B0053O89Z6|5.0|This is the show my hubby and I watch together and we LOVE IT! This is all he's wanted for Christmas the last few years!
B000002H38|5.0|replace the one I already had.<br /><br />Love the music from this artist.<br /><br />Keep up the good work in sales<br /><br />Love these songs
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I really enjoy the Prendergast  series.  The only complaint I have is the abuse of car salesmen and dealerships. Since<br />I work at a dealership I was very insulted, but I will forgive them, because I love them.
B0098VXE50|5.0|All good!! These my favorite about the Snow White and good quality and has fairy tales things and make happy.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Fantastic Movie enjoyed all of it even cried, spectacular scenes, It is well worth seeing again very life like absolutly envolved in it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Don't lose your humanity  even when faced with difficult decisions. Women are strong in spite of prejudice. And nature is beautiful
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love this game. I would love more just like this! I only wish it had more puzzles and was longer. But for the price itvwad great! no problems! thank you
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I was given the 40th Anniversary DVD five years ago but decided to order the 45th Collector's Edition the day after Thanksgiving.  I am so glad I did!  It is loaded with goodies.  Besides the blu-ray/DVD, there is a hardback book, post cards with photos from the shoot, a music box, a letter of authenticity, etc.  It is such a keepsake!  So, the 40th anniversary edition is being regifted to my daughter!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|LOVE IT. It has very soothing music. I play this game to unwind after long day at work or play.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|I downloaded this for my kids, but they gave up and I've been sucked in. I really enjoy the game, but refuse to spend extra money to buy the hearts and HATE that I can't earn them any other way but waiting days for a bonus or a chance to spin the wheel (which rarely results in any heart wins). Would be so much better if there was an option to buy them with the $ earned in the cafe - but I guess that's where they get you with these free games. So, I'll play  until I just give up. Oh well.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I like it alot but doesn't seem to have enough levels to play. alot of them are locked. I'm not very high-tech---could be user malfunction.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|Nice quick read, definitely has some good ideas and examples to help you develop people skills.<br /><br />Read twice and apply ideas to your daily interactions with people.
1400052181|3.0|Although the topic was very interesting and informative, I thought the amount of detail provided exceeded what would have been required to give a thorough treatment of the subject.
6305882592|4.0|My granddaughter picked this out as one of the old movies that she wanted in her collection, I know she'll enjoy it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The PLOT was beautiful and heart wrenching. The end throws you for a loop. Amazing story by an amazing author
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love Yahoo mail so much, I've been with Yahoo since 2001, the best thing I like from Yahoo is that even if you delete a message you could go back and look for it in the search bar. All my collegue work I saved it with Yahoo mail instead of a USB, I felt save saving my work. I have other emails but is nothing compare like Yahoo
B001TODCII|5.0|This movie was great and I got this DVD beautifully packaged in a normal cardboard box. Just straight up amazing if I don't say so myself.
B008NNNF7G|5.0|As Zac Brown said at a concert last year after Blackberry Smoke opened for ZBB, southern rock ain't dead, it's alive and well because of Blackberry Smoke.  These guys are amazing and The Whippoorwill is a great 5 star album.  This is one of those special albums that gets better every time I listen. Highly recommend.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I have all the DVD moves by Indiana Jones. I purchased the Blue series. This I really recommend. My wife and I really enjoy the series in blue ray format.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|While this little game won't tax your brain (much), it's a fun little break. The graphics are great. I'm glad I stumbled across this game.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I think it was a great book and it really showed fantastic detail and painted a fantastic picture in my mind's eye.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Bought season 1 thru 5. Have not received season 5 yet because they have not released it yet. My wife is a big fan of Castle. We have not watched the DVD's yet but I hope they are ok as far as quality of the recording. Received on time as expected. Have not compared price with other outlets, will do so to see if Amazon was competitive.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|its just like Twitter on my iPod or android but better. holla at the big screen tho and quick refreshing
1451629184|5.0|I enjoyed this book tremendously, it it amazing that this woman turned out to be normal considering the childhood she endured.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I wanted more out of the final book. I don't like the part that Katniss and her mother are no longer together and everyone just split up.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I love all of Susan Boyle's music and look forward to many more CD's in the future.  She is outstanding
B008M721MS|5.0|I'm giving this 5 stars because I can now video chat with my daughter. with missing her so much, it's nice to sit and chat. I get to see her facial reactions to my stories. AND ITS FREE. great to keep up with friends and loved ones.not a hard app to use, either.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|I love watching this moving, over and over again.  Even when it is not christmas, we can all relate to the clark griswold family...
B007J4T2G8|4.0|There were moments I had to remind myself of the characters age while reading and questioning the the tone of which the righter was getting across. It seemed young at first. Completely dumbfounded. I'm sure college aged people would know more about the sexual life as they have been experienced through other educational ways. Though there is the completely innocent Ana...<br />I was drawn into the book. It was a very easy good  read. Very hot, erotic, and idea infusing book. I would suggest the read for men who want new ways to please their woman knowing they enjoy delicious sex.<br />Excited to read the rest of the books.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. I really look forward to reading all the books. The book is better than the movie.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved how the author pulled me into the book and it was like i was watching the movie. It was awesome
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was gift given to someone else who has not had a chance to view it because they are in the hospital.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book I think it is so funny. I've also read his other  books and they are really good too. Also just to tell you Jeff Kinney is really good at writing books.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I purchased this for my grand son. We all watched it and I never laughed so hard. The movie was exceptionally well made
B0015DYIH2|5.0|AWESOME BOOK. I WILL DEFINITELY BE READING THIS BOOK AGAIN.I WILL TELL ALL OF MY FRIENDS TO READ IT TOO.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This twisted love story really gives a meaning to \\"silver linings.\\" The outcome of the novel is somewhat predictable from the beginning but the journey Quick takes you on from start to finish is one to love and appreciate.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|I really liked the book but this book did not have the word that I was looking for so sorry.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|Dairy of a wimpy kid was a really good book. To me it was really easy to read. I would recommend this book to my friends.
B005HJWWW8|1.0|I got the first amp at the end of September.  It acted like it was charging, but it never charged.. Looking now at these reviews I see I was not alone.  Since it was \\"under warranty\\" I returned the dead unit and ordered a replacement.<br /><br />Got the new/replacement amp around 10/10.  It worked great, but stopped working within two months.  Based on the first unit being DOA, and the second one lasting less than 60 days I'd have to say their amps are junk.. Good luck if you decide to roll the dice.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Love the game all should download if you like to build. It's a lot of fun especially when your bored. But you should get more money for stuff.
B009IRVSVQ|1.0|Love Bruno, want to support him, however the language just doesn't make any sense to me. Kids love Bruno's music, too bad can't listen to this CD. Going to try to return to Target.
B005LAII62|2.0|The story is quite dark and preachy, as it turns out, very morbid, quite sad.  Not fun.  Can't say more without spoilers, but it was not what I expected, and not fun.<br /><br />The movie could have been much better.  For example, the movie could have been a kid bullied for his misunderstood special gift of talking to the dead, then town gets terrorized by brain eating zombies (mocking zombie films here), then kid saves the day using his special gift to talk to the zombies and convince them to happily live beside the living, town prospers with tourism to see the zombies.  That's actually what I expected from this film, a zombie comedy, and was disappointed that it wasn't at all that.<br /><br />It's all fine, I suppose, if you go into this movie expecting it to be sad, morbid, dark, and preachy, but that's not what I expected, and I wouldn't have bought it if I had known.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Although sometimes a bit difficult to understand (we watched with closed caption the second time) this is a stellar movie, and a moving look at the drama of moving through the retirement phase of our lives. It is easily enjoyable by all ages--highly recommend! The cast is phenomenal, and includes the male star of Slumdog Millionaire in another memorable role. Delightful!
B000244FDW|5.0|this is the only version my wife will watch, and she just loves it. She cries every time, and then wants to watch it again.
0307346617|4.0|I thought it was an alright book, i feel sometimes it could of finished off the stories better or the stories could go on for a little longer.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I rated this book this way because I believe that it is the vast book ever and also because I think this will be the best hunger games book as a movie.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is a great app because it covers and sync all my books between my Droid Razr Maxx, Kindle and Galaxy tablet.
1250027624|5.0|If you like the PBS series 'Downton Abbey', you'll enjoy this book. Very well done, particularly in the quality of the illustrations.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Excellent movie, and great for both kids and adults.  Happy to give it as a gift.  Gift was greatly appreciated.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I saw this film with my granddaughter, who is nine. She was entranced, I was pleased. Disney and Pixar has given us an unusual twist to the Princess, gruff King, loving queen mother story.<br /><br />The Princess is Merida with the voice of the wonderful Scottish actress Kelly Macdonald. Merida is an a red haired Scottish tomboy whose life is changed by an early birthday gift of a bow, which quickly inspires her to become the best archer in the kingdom. Then we move to Merida as a young lady of marriageable age, who is angered by a request from Queen Elinor voice-over by Emma Thompson, to choose among three possible husbands chosen by her clan. Merida wants none of them and escapes to the forest after winning the archery contest. One event after another occur and the queen becomes a bear after a magic spell is cast. The search for god and evil occurs, and in the process new love and devotion come to the fore. All is right with the world after battles and barriers are broken down.<br /><br />This is not one of the ground breaking Pixar films, but good enough. The Scottish countryside seems almost real, beautifully crafted characters and background.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob. 12-29-12
B000055Y0Y|4.0|Great movie and we enjoyed it very much.  Clint Eastwood is a top notch actor, and did his usual good acting job.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I have loved Albom's books for a very long time now but this book will always hold a special place in my heart. My 8 yr. Old daughter wants to read it next and (because she is an old soul) She will be reading it soon! This book has so much to teach us all about the importance of time and how it can effect everyone around us! I would encourage everyone, everyone to read it!!!
B009329Y30|5.0|Well worth watching! Good story line with the ability for you to connect with the characters. Personal and touching story that isn't a chick flick
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Let me start by saying I was one of those who had a bootleg copy in the seventies (without knowing it). I now own a legal copy. I felt outrage when I heard that he did not receive the royalties from those 500,000 copies that were sold in South Africa.<br /><br />I have listened to this CD many times and it never gets old. It was the music of our times and generation (even though I was only a teenager at the time). The music is haunting and thought provoking. Havent seen the movie yet, but I will when it comes out on DVD. This album is high on the rankings in Amazon and I sincerely hope he's receiving the royalties he deserves now. He's such a decent and spiritual human being, who won't let himself be changed by success. I can't wait to see him live in California in a few months from now.<br /><br />My absolute favorite songs from the album are:<br />I wonder<br />Rich Man Hoax (The moon is hanging in the purple sky, Baby's sleeping while it's mother sighs)<br />Sugar Man (Silver magic ships you carry, Jumpers Coke, sweet Mary Jane)<br /><br />But there are so many great songs on just one album. Buy this CD! This man deserves the recognition for his great work, that went unnoticed by the nation. How it did, I'll never understand.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|This is a fun game -- on the Apple iPad. it is a fine and delightful time waster and is less overtly violent than the run-of-the-mill shooter games.<br /><br />I never could get the app to fully download to the device hard drive so that it could be played untethered to 802.11. we do not have constant wifi at this location so this review applies to just about all of the Kindle apps.  we have since returned the device to the store as it is way too limited for untethered use.
B0045XICB2|5.0|I read and enjoyed the whole series of the Twilight Saga, so of course, I wanted to see the movie, as well.  But like all movies, they are limited to what they can actually do on film.  It was well executed and entertaining, and while I would definitely watch it again, there is no substitute for one's imagination, which is always better than the movies.  I would still recommend watching all of the installments and be your own judge as to how well they measure to how you perceive the story in your head.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Nothing after this will even be believable. I hope they got a good pay day because like most fans that killed the series. Zombies riding bikes and using guns....really??!!
B006AZZPCM|3.0|Why do most Android phones come with YouTube Apps preloaded?  I have never had much luck with the apps in the past.  They just don't seem to work properly.  This TubeMate does help some, but you need to try it to be the judge.  Since it's free, if it doesn't work,&#34;no harm, no fowl&#34;.
B0084I9QIW|3.0|This was not the best.  Okay if you are an M.J. Fan.<br />Your money is better spent on the &#34;This Is It&#34; DVD.
B005XLN97M|5.0|Daughter wanted a very expensive Barbie house for Christmas. I found the beach house while shopping on Amazon. The reviews sounded good so I ordered for Christmas. She loves the house. I was very impressed with the details in this house. It was easy to put together. A great price makes it even better.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|The gameplay is good and it runs pretty smoothly with no lag for me but there aren't that many worlds and getting 3 stars for every level is HARD!! So getting path of Jedi for free is no deal for me. So rovio please just please add more worlds soon and this Will be a 6 star game
B009JBZH54|1.0|I was told/read that this product would ARRIVE withing 2-3 days. I BOUGHT this product about a week BEFORE Christmas and it STILL DID NOT COME. DISAPPOINTED! And this was a gift for my family member!
B0067EKY7M|5.0|Salmon Fishing in yhe<br /><br />Salmon Fishing in the Yemen<br />I found it very interesting, refreshing & satisfying.  Arrived in good condition & quickly.  Thanks<br /><br />Yemen
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Book was ok.....hard to really like the main character.  Messed up is one thing but she was off the charts
B00005LK94|5.0|I found this item to be delightful.  It had an excellent cast who played their parts in a wholesome manner
B009LXEBD4|5.0|All the best songs on one CD. Great Christmas gift for fans.  Go out and get this for the fan in your life.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|If you liked the old DOS space trading games of the '80s & '90s, this is an excellent example of the genre, only with better graphics, a better interface and virtually no bugs.  \\"The Quadrant\\" is not a large universe, but its more than big enough for a smart phone or tablet.  Combat is single player ship vs. single enemy ship, turn-based, with both sides selecting one action from a list of choices (advance, retreat, fire torpedoes, fire guns, board, etc.) and the outcome based on a combination of  ship equipment & player character stats and skill levels and dumb luck.  There is a fairly long list of achievements to shoot for, some of which are maddeningly difficult to nab.  On the higher game difficulties, simple survival becomes a challenge.<br /><br />Star Traders is good for many hours of entertainment...if you like this sort of game.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|A great read, not your typical zombie book. This focuses on humanities response across the globe to a worldwide epidemic. A very human story which held me from page one, sad and hopeful throughout,
B000ID37KO|4.0|Watched this for the first time when I was about 12 and I remember most of it.  If you like Alfred Hitchcock movies your library is not complete without it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this so much, I was blown away and loved how I couldn't predict what would happen next as has been a theme lately with some books I've picked!
B007HACDLK|5.0|His books alway captivate me. From the get-go, he has my attention. Cannot put the book down. Also, makes you wonder if any of the fiction could in actuality be true. I love Vince Flynn's books; I have read everyone of his books. Keep them coming.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the game, but do not have thin, slender fingers. They are not &#34;fat&#34; fingers, but all the same, I have to be pretty careful when I touch the screen on my Kindle Fire. Hard for me to get used to it, but I will manage.
B0086700CM|5.0|BEST GAME EVER!! PLEASE GET IT!!!!! NEEDS GAME MODES!!<br />I LOVE IT!!!!YOU WILL TO!! GREAT GRAPHICS!! You run you jump you turn you slide.
B009M1QRM8|5.0|We Pendergast fans waited a long time for this novel and it proved worth the wait.<br />Much of what has taken place from 'Cabinet of Curiosities' onward is finally brought together and explained.<br />Be prepared for many surprises and a few red herrings leading to our hero taking on a Neo Nazi stronghold on his own.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Not only is a multi-faceted picture of Lincoln as a master politician presented, but the author captures the political environment of the United States prior to the Civil War. Excellent research is matched with an ability to capture the human aspects of the major political stars of this historical period.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I told my daughter I wasn't going yo start watching another show but she got me hooked by watching it while I was folding laundry. Cannot get enough of this show. Superbly acted, beautiful cinematography and fantastic effects.  It will scare the pants off you and touch your heart at the same time.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|We (the whole family) enjoyed it in the theater and now get to watch when ever we like.  The boys watched it over and over for the first few days.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Addicted to the angry birds games so I had to try this one and I was not disappointed! For $2.99 it is well worth it to have some fun on my Kindle Fire HD!
B008F5YDRI|5.0|I enjoyed every moment of this movie. Witty dialogue and well acted. Won't be surprised if this one wins some awards.
B000UX6THK|5.0|It arrived in great shape and I was able to give this gift to my grandson and he absolutely loved it.  Thank you for the availability and great price.
B00190OHD6|5.0|This movie is a real tearjerker. I liked the plot very much. It deals with grief and how society or family expects young widowed people to deal with the grief. It also deals with guilt and regret: the thing we wish we would have done or said to our loved ones before their tragic and untimely death. It is a film that makes you think about your loved ones, about not taking them for granted. It is a beautiful movies. I wish I had discovered this movie before I became widowed at a young age.<br /><br />----Larry
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I was able to give this to my grandson a Christmas gift and he was very excited about it and absolutely loved it!
081297381X|5.0|The title says it: the high;ly improbable - we tend always to expect what has already &#34;normally&#34; happened and not to expect the &#34;unexpected&#34; - so we're always surprised. We need, rather, to expect that the high;y improbable will ALWAYS occur.
B004YESKU0|5.0|I already owned several SOAD albums, in digital format. However, I wanted to have them all in a physical format. This was a way to do so cheaply and in a compact manner. I like it. To anyone wondering, these aren't censored.
1400067820|3.0|After a while, he begins to sound like there's nothing good about anything new - that only ancient wisdom has any validity.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|Great new album definitely worth the price.  Loved the new songs.  Got it through amazon cloud player so it was immediate.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|arrived promptly sounds and looks just like the decscribtion this a must have for all taylor swift great value for the money
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|One of the oldest games but tons of fun to play.  Pretty great for a free app.  I am not thrilled about the advertisements that pop up while playing but otherwise it's a good game.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was great with lots of funny moments one of the best wimpy kid books I have read. I would love to read it again.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Love angry birds games but recently they have been having advertisements pop up while playing.  It's quite distracting.  Otherwise, the game is tons of fun to play.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I'm no scientist but the evidence presented in this book that wheat is behind many of today's health problems seems overwhelming.  I'll still allow other grains in my diet to a limited extent but I know that I lost 15 lbs of body fat last year when I eliminated &#34;cheap&#34; carbs (wheat!) from my diet.  And my blood test numbers are great.  The question is, how many people will make the effort to reduce or eliminate a food that permeates almost every processed food we eat?  Not easy.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|Very well written and conceived.  My only negative is that only two of his books (and there are many) are available for Kindle.
B000HEVALC|5.0|Any Elvis fan, especially of the early years when he was at his finest, will find this entertaining.  the chatter going on is fun to hear
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Great low profile flash for relatively close work. Nice warm fill lighting, but not something you can use to bounce off walls and ceilings.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is an amazing app! I use it all the time and its great for when I'm bored. The pictures are just incredible! I highly reccomend it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|LOVE it!  Very addictive. It really makes you think but yet it's a simple game. Already recommended it to others to try.
0596009208|5.0|Lots of puzzles and games make this book an interactive read.  Not for reference but good for learning. Would recommend
B000HAOVNK|5.0|I had to search to find this special album. It's easy to find Dream Evil, which might be the best Dio album, but it's almost impossible to find a quality recording of Trying to Burn the Sun! If you like Dio and rock in any way this is a must buy!
B007G51UV0|5.0|Solid build quality, plenty of slots, and clearly labeled. The LEDs that indicate faulty parts or connections was a nice touch and can prove helpful. If you're going to use the WiFi-GO feature (making your PC a wifi hotspot), make sure you install the module onto the motherboard BEFORE mounting it inside your case, or it will not fit/pins will be bent (the manual's instructions don't mention the module until after the mounting instructions). Overall, very pleased with this board so far.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|this is an ok game for free but it takes a long time to earn coins so its pretty much slow going unless you want to use money.....then its not free!
B009NXV2RK|4.0|Another can't put down Jack Ryan. A great summer beach read. I live these<br />A must have for Jack Ryan Fans.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Jumps around a bunch and hard to follow. Mediocre writing but exciting to read none the less.  Definitely worth reading.
B004SN8Z5M|5.0|The only draw back of these is that unlike the Vibram 5 fingers that have a cushioned heel, this is just a straight piece of shoe material that digs into your heel. Wear socks or moleskin while you break these in or you'll be crippled.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|It's just got clear in this book that the author just lost his way or its pushing away the end of the novel,  so he can sell more and more..... After finishing \\"A Feast for Crows\\" I thought it was going to be impossible for George R.R. Martin repeat his mistakes and deliver something so of the track again, but I was completely wrong about it.<br />A Dance of Dragons just showed me that things can always get worst. The story go nowhere until the final pages. It was just a relief when I finished the book, knowing  that I didn't have to go anymore through stories that doesn't add anything to the plot (if there are still a plot after all...).<br />From page one I was missing the cleverness and the fast developing of the plot - what made  \\"A Clash of Kings\\" one of my favorite books to date - but I was naive enough to persist through the book, hoping that somewhere the story will start kick-in... a sad disappointment.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Great movie. Great gift. My kids were happy that I had gotten it to add to our collection of favorite movies.
0920668372|5.0|Who wouldn't want this book in their library.  It brings tears of joy.  Love this book.  Every parent should receive this as a gift on the birth of their child, to keep and use as a reminder of our own aging parents.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|this I a great game... unlike most slender games, slender follows you (literary). he actually walks after you.<br /><br />I still don't know what it looks like when he catches you(I was to chicken, and shut of the game when he spawned next to me).<br /><br /> Ps. you do have to go into the woods to find some of the notes.
0805047905|5.0|Love reading this to my granddaughter.  The more animated you are with reading this book, the more interested the little ones are and filled with excitement to turn the next page
B0098VYCCE|5.0|The movie was fast moving and engaging.  Kristen Stewart was great! I truly loved the movie. This movie is a modern day fairy tale that anyone would enjoy.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much, but i bought it as a mystery.  I really think it should be classified in scify.  It reminded me of some of the old Twilight Zone stories.  Fortunately I like those types of stories.  It was quite riveting, and had a surprise ending.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Every parent should see this movie.  Not only is the movie fun, but it teaches us how important love and relationships are.<br />We bought many copies and give them as presents.  One of the best movies we ever saw.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked the book for the most part, but felt it was almost too...flat, and repetitive. I much prefer \\"Sharp Objects\\".
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|it so fun the dragons are cool and getting more stuff make it better to play.also if you have face book it is so much better.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Thank you for ending the saga. It was a joy to read your so work. Wonderful creativity and imagination on your part.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I like the  book what  more can i say. I loved the original Percy Jackson series growing up and I am going to love this one too.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|What a pleasant surprise.  It works great.  In virtually minutes I had it set up so that I had complete access to my laptop computer from my Kindle Fire.  I highly recommend it.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I HAD TO READ THIS FOR A BOOK PROJECT AND I LIKED IT . KIND OF DRONED THEN JUST ABRUBLTY ENDED THOUGH
B0063IH60K|5.0|LOVE IT! ENJOYING EVERY GAME AND RELAXING MOMENTS AWAY FROM DAILY TASKS. CHEERS FOR GAME PLAYING AT WORK AND TRAVEL.<br />Recommend highly.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I enjoyed the movie greatly. It fills in a lot of missing aspects from the previous films and it seems to tie them together well.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Could not put it down. I felt connected to Anthony throughout the book and developed such an appreciation for the music he and the band created. The nature of his addiction was devastating and fascinating. His experiences were unfathomable to me, but I am a more understanding person from reading about them. Great read.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Price is right and is pretty good too! If you like survival stories it good, of not well it might not be your cup of tea.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|I have to admit, at first I had my doubts about this game. I am glad it was put up for free so people could try it out. I hope that these very awesome developers earn some money from this app game.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I purchased this movie to add to my personal movie Christmas movie collection. I want my 4 year old grandson to be able to see the classics as her grows up. This is an excellent movie and a must see for anyone who believes!
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I loved the romance in this story for the first half, but then Travis started doing every little thing that was a red flag for an abusive boyfriend. I tried to ignore it because I couldn't. It was disturbing. That being said, if you could recognize that for what it is, go ahead and read it; it is a great story. I'm only giving it 3 stars because it encouraged abusive relationships. I'm 18 and know too many in relationships like that. I don't approve of condoning abusive relationships. This is a crappy review, but I needed to point out that.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Nolan's take on Batman is by far my favorite screen adaptation (big or small).  Having the trilogy on blu-ray in one set at a great price can't be beat.
B00A77II0U|4.0|medium difficultly. Definitely used the hint button on several occasions.  The story line was interesting and creepy.  I highly recommend this game for a fun quick play.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suspenseful and I couldn't put it down. Can't wait for mockingjay! Reading on the kindle hd fire made it even better
B009JZTOG8|5.0|i really enjoyed this series.  at times i get lost as they go back and forth from their own worlds. but overall i couldn't stop watching it.  stayed home on vacation just to watch them all.
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|Scores the glass, but takes way too long to separate the glass in the typical boiling water to ice bath.
B0084U0IEG|1.0|This is the first book I have purchased for my kindle that I actually tried to return after reading 32%. I am usually very committed to finishing a book once I start but found this one not worth my time or money. unfortunately it was too late. I do not recommend this boring and very difficult to read book
1781163243|5.0|Bought this book for my son for Christmas.  He loves it.  This book arrived fast & in perfect condition, brand new as described.  Great detailed photos, great information, perfect for any Halo fan!
B007SGM084|5.0|The first book I ever read from cover to cover, twice!!!!  Love the love story, mystery and I have to admit the love making!
B00000IQW5|4.0|I bought this movie because it was Audrey Hepburns last movie and I have always been a big fan hers.
B003YBNRHU|4.0|I really enjoyed this video.I originally saw it on PBS.The new songs are just as good as the oldies.Good interviews with band members.
B00006JSS8|5.0|This CD has all of my favorite songs. I have always loved Stevie Wonder ever since I was a kid.
B0042VJ1PI|2.0|interesting, but very poorly written. the television show is definitely better. obviously a different writer with better ideas and writing ability
B005HJWWW8|1.0|Doesn't work.I charged it up as instructed, plugged it in and nada.  On or off, there is no sound. Complete dissapointment.
B002PEP4SC|2.0|poorly written. a high school english honor student could have done better and, obviously, the tv series was written by someone much better!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great book. Recommend it to people of all ages. I am not a book person, yet I really enjoyed this book.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|Thne one and anly good book mario puzo wrote. He should have stopped here and realize that he is definitely not a writer
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Loaded with pop culture references from my childhood and a story almost as immersive as the OASIS itself.  If you were a teenager in the 80s and also a geek read this book.
B0053O89RY|5.0|Great video!  The whole family enjoys this one.  Would recommend this video to anyone who likes the show.  It is a great one to have in your collection!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I had the same problem with the news feed not loading everything. I reinstalled the app and no longer have the problem. Hope this works for everyone else.
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|I just love love love this show. It's a total flashback to my high school years and now I finally have it all on dvd!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the reason I love the Kindle Fire the most...Bingo on the go!!!  Can even play it on Southwest Airlines now!  What a way to travel, don't miss a day on my game!  Course, can't wait to read a good book on the go too and check my email.  So many possibilities.....so much fun.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Need I say more? Oh right, and Matt Bomer, and Joe Mangienello...and a decent storyline. It's just so damn good!
B0086700CM|5.0|I am almost 70 years old and learning this game is tons of fun!!!  I am hooked!  I play it often now.
B004LUS390|1.0|Can't change resolutions like the IOS Version. I want to have more res than 1024*600. This Sux, fix it Autodesk!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Crazy fun game, addictive and play it over and over.  No housework being done for me!!!<br />Besides who needs to clean house every day!!! LOL
B009E3EXMU|5.0|great  collection for any fan even a non fan the dvd is crystal clear and the sound quality is excellent on the cd and dvd the live concert is amazing I am not a fan of this group but watched this concert because the old groups are so much better than the singers nowadays at least their music makes sense and you can understand what they are saying
B0094BB4TW|5.0|How nice it is to chat on face book while on the go.  Next best thing to the cell phone.  This is a fabulous invention!
0810979772|2.0|waste of money because there was barely any writing in the book My kids love all the diary of a wimpy kid books and the movies but this is the only book they didn't like because there was barely any writing in it.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|Having some problems making it stand up like shown in the picture, but I think it is very chic and protective of my Kindle Fire.  Most of the time I hold it on my lap.
B005LAIHGI|2.0|this movie has got some funny spots but mostly it dragged and the comedy was very disgusting I thought it would be alot funnier but Borat was much better than this. I was looking for a cleaner version but there is none
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is amazing. Tantalizing, mouth-watering, adult reading.  Nothing like a yummy Christian Grey to start your day. On to book number 2.
B00782O7IY|1.0|I purchased this movie for a girls night and one friend wanted to see it and found it on Amazon at a good price.  We just got around to watching it this past Friday and none of us liked it.  We couldn't figure out how this movie was nominated for an Oscar. Just not a good movie don't even know what to say here.  I have watched older silent movies and got more out of them then this one.  The captions where not good at all, acting was ok, but I think the only good thing in the movie was the Jack Russell now he could act, he made the movie as far as I am concern.  No I wouldn't tell anyone to buy this movie I couldn't even give the one I got now away to the girl who wanted to watch it in the first place.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I reviewed a story about a demigod who who took risks to save the world and became a great hero
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|A bit long winded but good twist in the middle. There's an actual story here instead of just a teen romance
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It was an interesting book that I couldn't put down after I first picked it up. I recommend for teens.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love playing this with my friends and my 8year old daughter.  The words are appropriate and it's a good game for everyone.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Such a good book. I can't wait to see it brought to life in theatre. Nicholas Sparks is hands down one of the best male Romance writers..
B006BZ8WAI|5.0|This was an mp3 purchase. It was as expected. Download was fast and easy. Great sound, what can I say, Korn rocks!!!
B003U0AHBO|5.0|5 good 5 sooooooo awesome i don't even know what to say like Russel Crowe is the best actor ever.
B004ZQBOK0|5.0|This is by far one my favorite cds by them. Every single song I love and that is rare for me to love every song off a cd. I love there positive message as well on the reasons why they are by far one the best rock bands out there.
B005LAIIRQ|2.0|Here's the issue with \\"The Grey\\"--either you buy into the idea that this movie is in fact more than just a poorly executed tale of wilderness survival, that it is actually an existential consideration of the human condition and the significance we must extract from our struggle to defeat the absurd obstacles life throws in our way.<br /><br />I don't buy it.<br /><br />Perhaps it's the choice of the villain in this film. Wolves already get a bad enough rap in our culture. Here they are cast as bloodthirsty predators who hunt humans for sport (but wait--maybe they're metaphors for humans...the only species that hunts for sport...nah, that doesn't work either). To confuse matters even more, some attacks that are filmed to look brutally deadly turn out to be anything but. And then there's the confusing matter of Liam Neeson's lost love. I don't begrudge a film its effective use of ambiguity, but when that ambiguity turns to obscurity and seems to unnecessarily complicate the plot and the protagonist's character development...well, then I take issue.<br /><br />\\"The Grey\\" has actually turned up on a few critics' end-of-year \\"Best of\\" lists, so I took a chance and watched it in spite of the panning it had received from so many other critics. I rarely regret my cinematic choices, but \\"The Grey\\" is one that I do wish I had opted against.
1465001107|5.0|All things Michael Jackson is great!!!!!!!.....This is an absolutely perfect calendar.  The photos are awesome!!!!.....The calendar exceeded my expectations and was delivered in a timely fashion.  This product is OUTSTANDING.
B004UXUX7S|3.0|The film deals with a family in conflict with themselves and the twisted story line.  The acting is top notch.  The language is realistic.  I can empathize with the subject matter and characters but do not believe it will be worth watching a second time.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I'd recommend every person should purchase this series. And I'd recommend the one with David A's commentary. The series is well segregated into 5 DVDs, each having around ten 50-minute episodes. Each episode ends with a 10 minute &#34;making of this episode&#34; video. The whole series has been painstakingly created (my gratitude to the crew), and is a gift for generations to come. With each episode, you really can't help marvel the variety and beauty of nature in it's various forms! My biggest takeaway was the nature of life, and how climate change has been impacting our planet.
B007EE5820|5.0|This is a very interesting and in site full story of one of the most amazing personality of our time. Riviting reading
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I have tred to stay away from Blu-Rays of movies that I already own on DVD mostly because transfers have been less than fantastic, due to the cheapness of film studios that mostly push a dvd transfer on to Blu-Ray and sell that. BAD FORM! This<br />Anthology is EXCELLENT. Perfect for HD viewing. Sound is good on all versions. Although Aliens is a favorite, Alien looks so good that it's worth the $30 just for those films.
B007O4XX9K|5.0|I love this album.  The lyrics and the music show a complexity and maturity that made me like Joe Walsh all over again!
076781214X|5.0|Could not believe how quickly I received this.  Like they were in the same city!  Packaged very well and came through as advertised and in good shape.  Would use vendor again!
0061537969|5.0|This novel, told from the point of view of the golden Lab/terrier mix dog Enzo, manages to be heart-warming without being sappy.  I loved it, and this year I chose to give it as a Christmas present to several of my young nephews and one of my grandsons.  I hope it has the same effect on them that it did on me--making me think about the perspective of the pets in our lives.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I like the app and I think it is almost better than angry birds.Although the adds do frusterate me; it is very very very very very very fun. Especially good if you have lots of time to beat.
1423140605|5.0|This latest in the &#34;Heroes of Olympus&#34; series was much appreciated by our 13-year-old grandson, who loved the two prior books in the series.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Arrived on expected date, and in expected condition. There isn't much more to say, if you are looking for the First Season of Dexter on DVD, here it is on amazon.
1451695195|1.0|While emotive , this docudrama fails to match all JudeoChristian revelations from God. When He is revealed Genesis 3 Genesis 17 John 11 Luke 24 Luke 23:33 and Romans 8 he is not a floating \\" orb\\" or fluttering butterfly... Recollections in this book are more of the authors rememberances of his parachuting exigencies than an interaction w Jahweh .... Jacob wrestled w Jahweh not a \\" orb\\" and the thief on the cross was promised Paradise not a float thru rainbows.  Poor poor research
1454901276|3.0|One tragedy...and then another...and then another...and yes, still another. So many terrible disasters befall these characters, so many dark secrets lay buried in their pasts, and the funny thing is after a while it starts to become ludicrous rather than tragic or moving. The resolution of the mystery at the heart of this book is completely absurd, and I almost threw the book across the room when I got to it.<br /><br />That's the bad news. The good news is Peter May crafts strong, interesting characters, and his description of the guga hunt is riveting. In fact, even though I love murder mysteries, I kind of wish May had just told the story of Fin's childhood and left out the murder (and perhaps he did start writing the novel with that in mind but then jazzed it up with the mystery to make it more dramatic -- and possibly sell more books?).<br /><br />Gist: read it if you don't mind over-the-top melodrama, or just skip to the trip to An Sgeir and ignore everything else.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I wanted to download google chrome.  I have not been able to use it .  This makes it hard to surf the net.
B009CPE424|5.0|My 7 year old daughter loves this movie.  She is always calling me in to watch the really funny parts.  She's a dog/animal lover and this very much holds her interest.
B009RH973I|4.0|Nice product for easy use and transport.  Bought 3 for my childrens Kindle HDs.  They seem to be doin a great job so far.  You will need to purchase a screen protector. I would have rather had the durability of an Otter (has built in screen protection), but they don't have one for the 7&#34; HD only the 8.9&#34;.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My 7 year old daughter and her friends loved watching this movie.  It was cute to hear them talk about it after it was done.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie is great for people who like singing or are of College Age. It is so easy to relate to.
030758836X|5.0|Excellent book! Like a roller coaster...but I didn't like the ending...but I suspect that is the intent with a story like this. I hated characters...and then I didn't...then I did. This author has the gift of toying with her readers.
076790592X|5.0|if you want to get the most out of life you need to read this book. I will probably read again.
0547848412|5.0|Wow! I'm almost breathless.  Martel is a phenomenal wordsmith. I have never highlighted more passages in a book than I did in this one. The ending.....my mind is still pondering that ending. The end had my head spinning. I had to read the ending twice. This is a book I believe people will love or hate...or just not understand.  It is certainly a book that needs to be read at the right time in ones life. I've owned it for several years and am honestly glad I didn't read until now because I might have not appreciated it in the way I do now. Will be interesting to see show they have portrayed this in the movie.  I would add this to the top of my \\"best loved\\" books ever.
B0086700CM|4.0|I think that temple run is super because it is like adventure through a jungle. And it is awesome and cool
0425263916|3.0|I really enjoyed the first one but this one was a bit disappointing. In a nutshell this could have been a 4 chapter book, the rest was all just filled with sex. I have no issue with that if the story line would keep progressing but this one stalled out until the ending.  I would imagine it is hard to write a trilogy...usually the second book just draws out the ending.  I will read the last one when it comes out though because I want to see how the author wraps up the series...and Gideon is just smoking hot!
B0053O89WY|5.0|I am happy with this DVD set.  It is great to watch movies with out commericals.  It came in time for  christmas.
0061537969|4.0|I think I always avoided this book because I have zero interest in car racing. What I discovered that while this has elements of the main character's love of racing, this is more a story about love between a dog and his family and their love for him. I loved it.
B005SCSL56|5.0|I first heard about Chris Colfer through glee, and from there I fell in love with him. I found out everything I could watched interviews, and every single episode of glee. When I found out that he had written a book I knew that I had to read it. I thought that it would be simple but I was very wrong, happily so this book has changed my life. I think that everybody should read it to their own children because it will influence their lives forever for the good. I cannot wait for the next one.
0425263908|4.0|After forcing myself twice to finish the first book in Fifty Shades of Grey which was one of the worst written books I've ever read, I had my reservations about this series. But...but...I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Pretty much written porn I know...but it's some damn good porn! On to book two. Let the judging of the prudish begin on me.
034580404X|5.0|Anniversary gift!!! My wife wants the books and i Bought her the trilogy. Thanks a lot! and a happy new years!!
B008Y1YJ90|3.0|OK, let's separate the review about the movie from the product (i.e., the physical disks and digital copy). The movie is GREAT! I would give it 5 stars if it's just about the movie. However, the digital copy distribution through the new UltraViolet (UV) channel totally sucks. I have to open 3 different online accounts (yes, you read that right, 3 different accounts) to achieve the simple task of being able to watch the digital copy on my iPad. I have to open first the SONY Entertainment Account to redeem the digital copy code, a separate UV account to link my digital copy on my SONY account to UV, and finally a Flixster App account on my iPad to finally be able to retrieve the digital copy to my iPad. Along the way many times the websites crashed, were very slow to respond, or were totally confusing to follow. It took me close to an hour to finally figure out how to get my digital copy. The whole process is totally unintuitive to me. I wonder how many other consumers just gave up trying to get the digital copy they paid for? Why do the paying customers have to jump through so many hoopla to get to the digital copies?
B00A5052YE|3.0|I have enjoyed her last 2 albums but this one sounded strangely like her very 1st one. Did't sound as mature as she has become a mother & gotten married.
B0080SZ0V8|2.0|Some of the games are very easy.  The dots and lines game is very frustrating.  I had to redo it over and over until eventually I just ran out of time and then got kicked back to the beginning and had to start all over with all the puzzles in that book. That is my biggest complaint about this game. I quit the game and am deleting it off my kindle.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It was ok. Didn't care for the ending. But it was still a well written book. Might buy the next ones not sure though.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Really great game!  My favorite so far.  Fun and challenging but not too hard where you get frustrated.  Definitely recommend if you like the hidden objects games like I do.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Great movie. Glad I own it so I can watch it whenever even if its not Christmas time it a awesome comedy all year long.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|LastPass remembers the rest. Especially good for my mobile devices. The research I've done indicates I'm now virtually unhackable. I have the default password generator create mixed character/number passwords that are 11 characters long. Every site has a different password.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is an amazing book! I can't tell you how much I love Colleen Hoovers books. You will instantly fall in love with the characters and the story. There are tons of emotions in this book. I highly suggest this book and its heartwarming story.
B00797MB0O|5.0|This movie is worth watching to just see Charlize Theron display her acting agility.  She is hands down at the top of her game and its always amazing to see someone so good at their craft.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great!l Better then the movie and I could not put it down. Worth the reading and time spent.<br />Sjwingate<br /><br />Sjwingate

B000JQUKKU|5.0|Great book, wonderful classic, formatted well for the Kindle.  No misspellings or punctuation errors, and highly enjoyable read.  The read aloud function works great!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is but the most favourite game I've ever played and I recommend everyone to play the PC and all of the other ones! If you don't like the graphics of this game then just play it longer you'll get it!<br /><br />Take it from me, I've played since it was exicted by notch!<br /><br />Your bestest buttie,<br />Captian_killerz
B0092MKFIY|4.0|These guys have a great sound. The first half of the album is fantastic. The last few songs are less enjoyable in my opinion but this is still an album worth owning.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I like it cause   it          can  tell you about  all stuff you need  to  know and you   can  learn    about  to and i  read about some and some  tell    you about  stuff that  have  verbs  ajtive  more qolity .
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Like Milliondollar Baby and Gran Torino.<br /><br />Knowledge of baseball helps in understanding this film.<br /><br />Father - daughter movie featuring good acting.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|I don't usually write movie reviews. This deserves my input. I wanted to like this movie. Unfortunately, no one wanted to make a movie about Barnabas Collins I would like to watch.<br /><br />The premise was there. So much potential, yet somehow this hot mess of a movie tossed it out the window. Performances? Meh, okay. Great actors? Yes, most certainly. Storyline that allowed the movie goer something, anything that would make the characters something to care about? Nope.<br /><br />I paid to watch this. I would not recommend this movie. Bad, not in a good-bad movie way. Just bad.
B00125WAWS|5.0|Denzel Washington is synonym of good movies. He got it right even in that nonsense Book of Eli film. The Great Debaters is a must see for all law students.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I got a tablet for Christmas and wanted the Facebook app.  It was easy to locate and download.  I can't get all teh features of facebook on my laptop, but I can get my timeline and share with my friends.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Totally addictive. Every morning I get up and search rooms.  It's not to crazy hard and not cheesy easy.  Really is a super fun game!
B0043M4TYY|3.0|This version of a popular bestseller does not permit easy browsing in ePub versions. Cross-filing references cannot be traced. Accommodation and lodging citations for many cities are both limited and out of date.The historical background is presented in a disjointed fashion. The many forms and expressions of Indonesian culture are glossed over--- if discussed at all.This volume requires editorial control
B004UID2LC|5.0|its amusing because I don't have Internet often so I download my favorite videos to watch them on the go it works great on my kindle fire I reccomend it to people on the go
B000UVT3OI|5.0|great songs. Good price.. All my favorites in two CD,s . If your a country music fan, you have to have this in your collection.
1596177373|5.0|My husband loves anything Tim Burton. i think he was more excited about these cards then anything else he got for xmas. Love them!
B005H0IW6W|4.0|A good classic to have in the Christmas collection.  Definitely puts you in the holiday mood and kind of reminiscent of the Rat Pack guys Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, etc.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Fun game, just like the original. The controller is a little tricky to use, not like the old joy stick.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Awesome. Funny and enjoyable  wish there was a follow up or that it was part of a series. Hope so in the future
B009O2XY12|5.0|This is one bubble mania. It is great for everyone ages 5&amp;over. I let my cousin play and she just love it. I will recommend to everyone
B0086700CM|2.0|The game is fine. The graphics are good. The problem with this app is that the touch does not work very well. It gets really annoying, the app lets you controll the touch sensitivity but it doesn't work at all. This app all in all is just ok I would not recommend this to anyone. It is fun the first few days then you do not play it any more.
0375869026|5.0|A very heartwarming story that I would recommend to everyone, especially those in education. Teaches a lesson on accepting differences.
0756405890|5.0|Even though it's been my experience that people exaggerate when comes to rating some books, I just cannot say enough good things about this writer. I was absolutely hooked 50 pages in, and was sorry it had to end. Beautifully written, and elegantly told, it would not suprise me one bit if this book became a classic. Before I was half way through I had to order the second book (Wise Mans Fear). Even if you are not a Fantasy Genre type of reader you do yourself a great injustice if you don't give this story a try.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a fabulous movie for any age.  It's funny, moving, and totally engaging and a wonderful way to experience the sights and sounds of India.  The story line is particulary poignant for the 50+ crowd. I watched it with 3 generations from teen to 60+ and we all enjoyed it!  The cast is made up of the cream of the crop of British actors - it's a total movie experience.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It just not the best app it has glitches and some times it won't read ky finger when I am playing.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I bought this set of DVD's as soon as it came it. Great TV series I highly recommend it.  I thoroughly enjoyed it!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|The effects are great, you can compare it to super Mario and the likes. It's great for all ages. Get it!
1250027624|5.0|I haven't read this book.  It was given as a gift for Christmas to my husband who enjoys Dowtown Abbey
B001NLKT60|5.0|Picked up from the beginning, much faster than it's predecessor. Great read and some background information on the single most unusual and confusing character. Can't wait to read the next one!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Bought this to watch because my girlfriend recommended it for us to watch. We sat down and watched it (all 4 or 6 discs) and it was incredibly fascinating. The camera crew did an awesome job of putting you right up close with the animals and wild life. I recommend this to any individual whether you are big on nature or not. It makes you appreciate the planet we live on so much more. Beautiful series.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|Finally a game to challenge your brain.  Easy enough to fill time with but still make you think to finish the levels. Hard enough I still haven't gotten two of the final levels. I'm. Ready for a Gem Splnner Three.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It's okay. The games are time consuming, but fun. You start out with a bunch of free games, and need to complete each one. You can earn free money from that and use that money to buy more games.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|I would have enjoyed it better had they made Michele Pfeiffer's character a vamp too. Funny moments, but not enough. Too many boring parts, had the family chit-chatting instead of paying attention.
B004LROMSO|4.0|This is quite a nice contrast to the portrayal of the legend as done by BBC's \\"Merlin.\\" While Merlin in \\"Merlin\\" uses magick to get he, Arthur, and the kingdom out of jams each episode, the Merlin in \\"Camelot\\" is justifiably conservative in the use of his skills--one of many fundamental differences where \\"Camelot\\" is more mature and suspenseful (although \\"Merlin\\" shines at times when it takes itself more seriously). I find little sense in reviews complaining that Camelot is \\"PC\\"...Is Colin Morgan's portrayal of Merlin in \\"Merlin\\" rubbish because it lacks a politically incorrect world? Yes, Game of Thrones is fantastic, but not everything needs to be covered in blood and harlots. This is FICTION, not a documentary! The storyline in Camelot is acceptable and many of the actors are exceptional. I welcome any half-decent swords and sorcery tale, and this one is at least as entertaining as the \\"Legend of the Seeker\\" and \\"Merlin\\". The good outweighs the bad here; it is really a shame that it was cancelled, if for no other reason than to see what other tricks Merlin had up his sleeve.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Great wrap up to the trilogy, but Lisbeth Salander will be sorely missed, by this faithful fan!!! How will we go on without her.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|good free game to help pass time or relax after a bad day just wish got more free coins do not want to buy coins otherwise it's a fun game.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book was not at all what I was expecting. And that is not a bad thing at all. A tragic story with and unexpected twist and a sweet ending. It was a very emotional book.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My 13 yo son and 9 yo daughter really enjoyed the movie.  They laughed a lot.  What little I saw seemed good.
B00005JLET|5.0|We got this hard to find vhs tape and my kids love all these movies. Great price! Sometimes you can get the same deals on Ebay.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|The first thing you will notice taking this out of the box is just how much metal went into crafting it.  It is heavy and thick enough to pierce armored tanks!  It has a decent edge and can be brought up to razor sharp with just a few minutes effort on bench stones.  Having owned a BK-7 I took notice that the handles for both are near identical.  It feels nice in the palm but is definitely on the slippery side.  Most will want to upgrade to something that's a little more blood retention friendly.  The sheath that comes with it is a big improvement over the standard BK-7 model.  When placed in the sheath it locks solidly and takes considerable effort to dislodge.  Bottom line...this one ain't falling out no matter what kind of acrobatics you put it through.<br /><br />So, for the price you can't go wrong.  This knife, with care should give many years of enjoyment and performance.
B004UO0SAO|5.0|I lost my HP calculators years ago.  this emulator is a perfect replacement for both of them.  thank you very much.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|- I have to say this may be the best purchase I've ever made. Not only is it almost silent, but it does an amazing job at keeping my fx-8350 cool.<br />- I have the 8350 overcolcked to 4.5GHZ as opposed to 4GHZ and so far it has done an amazing job of both staying quiet and efficiently keeping the cpu cool.<br /><br />- For those of you considering other heatsinks, this is the one to buy.<br /><br />My only con towards this product is the hour and a half it took me to set up for socket AM3. I practically had to take apart the entire computer to get behind the motherboard and mount the holder for the radiator. Other than setup, simply amazing. Can't beat the price!
1582701709|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my Granddaughter. She loved it.<br />She said its was very inspirational. thank you
1401323820|5.0|If you love the tv show &#34;Castle&#34;, you'll love this book, too! Charming, funny and clever... just like the show!
141694737X|5.0|My 16 months old son loves this book! He likes the lift up options and loves to discover by himself each little animal. It is a really nice book that helps to teach animal's names and the sounds they make or the adjectives that describe them.

B000B7QCKE|5.0|We added this DVD to our Yanni collection to upgrade from a VHS version.  We have watched it numerous times and always enjoy his concerts
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|We are late getting into Angry Birds but my husband and I absolutely love it!  It is very addictive and it totally captures our attention!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was looking for a book to start after Fifty Shades and this was a perfect match.  I loved the storyline and easily found myself wanting more for Gideon and Eva.  The characters are passionate and intense.  The author does a great job building a story and letting your mind run wild.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is excellent in every detail.  It has exceeded all my expectations.  I want to read more from Doris Kearns Goodwin.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|An old English yarn, I liked it, it could have moved along a little more but all in all it was a good read.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I received this book at a perfect time in my life.  It helped me to understand what was required of me in the journey to come.
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|5 stars because mint condition, arrived quicker than expected and an ultimate all-time favorite movie for all guys and gals. It has suspense, romance, and travels around the world. My teenage boys love the unique hand to hand fighting techniques. Borne doesn't tell you why he's going to do things this way, just does it and is amazed how he knew it would work! After the escape or conspiracy or scene, you go &#34;now it all pieces together&#34;.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It isn't the worse book I have ever read, but was disappointed with John Grisham with this book.  It started off with a feeling of &#34;so what is going to happen&#34; ... but then in the middle of the book it DRAGGED on and on about setting this guy up.  I just started skimming pages just so I could get to the end so I could say I actually finished the book ... since I paid for it.  I love so many of John Grisham's books, that I was so surprised on this one.  I just read someone else's feedback saying they didn't believe John Grisham wrote this book because they were so surprised how lacking of a book it was.  I agree.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This movies was sooo awesome. When i seen the previews i knew it would be one I would buy  after watching it I was amazed
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great Book It kept my interest from start to finish. Highly recommend this who done it book.I will look for more William Landay's books.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Best price and awesome to see them on Bluray. Buy it and add these awesome movies to your collection! A+

B009GED3HS|5.0|I have followed the show since the beginning and now that I am finally caught up I am loving the 8th season!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was so incredible!! From beginning to end I had extreme trouble even attempting to put it down! Needless to say I finished it within a few short days. Hands down one of the best stories I've ever read. So inspiring and passionate and REAL. If your hesitating to read this don't! I swear it'll be worth it.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|Loved the movie...hated that I kept losing the Amazon connection.  Thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  Utilized my Amazon Prime account for this one.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I like this app. It is a little hard to get use to using. I would certainly recommend this app.
B0060ZJ74O|4.0|This is one of those sports movies that appeals to sports fans and non-fans alike because it's a well told story. Brad Pitt delivers another reliable performance and Jonah Hill and Phillip Seymour-Hoffman were also tremendous. I went with this version mainly for the Ultraviolet digital copy, but there are a lot of interesting extras for those that want to dig deeper in to the story and film making. A must see for baseball and movie fans.
B008J05EL8|3.0|This app works fine but I was disappointed that I had to purchase it just to be able to view the first doc that I sent. I thought it should have come with the other app.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Angry birds free<br />It's fun.  I enjoy all the versions.I'm sure there will be challenges getting to the higher levels.
0007447868|1.0|I first came upon this series on TV.  Someone lent me the first season with high praise.  It was really good!  High production values, good actors, anxious wait for the next episode, etc. Not really like a run-of-the-mill TV series at all. Not having access to HBO, I figured I'd give the books a try.  The first one, A Game of Thrones, was pretty much like the first TV series.  Swell, I thought, I'll continue on.  About Book Three, I began to smell a rat.  The descriptions got longer and more pointless, characters weren't really developing, just appearing and sort of wandering around, and what I assumed to be the plot trajectory slowed way down and began to be too discursive and irresolute.  Then I read a cover blurb about George Martin.  Rather than being \\"The American Tolkien\\" (please, people), he was actually a TV writer himself, who worked on \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" among others.  OK, a fantasy background, but still a TV fantasy background.  I had an acquaintance who worked in a TV show, and her goal was for the show to stay on the air for at least seven seasons.  After seven seasons, with residuals for reruns, she felt she could retire.  She was an actor, so I don't know how writers are paid, but the seven-season goal was definite.  She was working in TV around the time this guy Martin was, so I'm sure he's aware of this protocol.<br /><br />Now, let's stop and think about how series TV is structured.  In the first episode, often a two-hour movie, the scene is set, the characters are introduced, in an often-gripping story, which certainly makes you want to tune in next week for more.  Unfortunately, many TV series never get better than their introductory episodes.  Characters are developed slowly, with new quirks introduced every few weeks, until you feel you know them and welcome them into your living room every week like old friends (that's the hope, anyway).  Difficulties are overcome (usually crimes are solved, bad guys demolished, etc.) in a story arc that takes one episode.  All done in the usual ways by the usual characters, with a few new ones to move the story along who disappear at the end of the episode.  So far, so good.<br /><br />But wait, these books don't seem to have resolutions.  Okay, you say, maybe it takes more than one book to finish a really big, complicated story arc. So far, there's five books.  The reviews I've read of the fifth book seem to promise more of the same:  glacial story progress padded out with smaller and smaller events occurring to the main characters, plus a few extras who come and go.  Characters seem to devolve rather than evolve (esp. the female ones), and their little adventures seem to get more and more insignificant.  You start to get the feeling that you could pick up the next book without having read the one before it and pretty much catch up on the plot after reading just a little bit.  Folks, this isn't even series TV, it's soap opera.  Think about it:  Those things can last forever.  The same characters, or dynastic lines, continue on and on, with very few changes.  They react to the next phone call, bit of gossip, wedding, funeral, etc., in their customary ways, which, as devotees of this soap or that, you've come to know and love. Things happen, but nothing changes, and the whole juggernaut goes on and on and on, seemingly forever.  Thus is Song of Ice and Fire, but with swords, gore and nudity (a no-go on daytime TV).<br /><br />I'm definitely quitting after this book, but for those of you who like the soap-opera form, knock yourselves out.  But please, folks, let's get real. This isn't Dickens, it isn't Tolkien, it isn't even \\"Hawaii 5-0.\\"  At best, it's \\"Dynasty\\"; at worst, it's \\"General Hospital.\\"<br /><br />This review by Peggy L. Myrontakes one episode.

B008GOG98Y|4.0|Classic, if a bit dated, film about the post-High School days in the late '70s and early '80s, with a focus even a modern teenager enjoyed.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie follows in the tradition of bring it on. Not so sure girl gets put in with a group of other girls and they have to work together despite all their differences(because girls like that can get over themselves) to win. It's a good watch if you know what you're in for. If you're looking for something serious and deep, this is not for you. But gotta love fat Amy.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|My daughter loves it.  That is all that matters. It is just what I ordered and in time for Christmas.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it is never the same, my grandson likes to sit with me and play fast moving game.
B003VPWXRO|4.0|I've always loved Portia de Rossi (especially in Arrested Development).  She is undeniably classy and cool.  That said, I have come to expect very little from celebrity memoirs.<br /><br />However, I was blown away by this book.  I thought it would be a completely unrelatable story, but instead I was greeted with the most engaging book I've read all year.  I couldn't put it down.  She doesn't hold back even a little about her struggle with her weight and with the industry's standards of beauty, as well as her closeted sexuality and her difficulties in being open about it.  Regardless of whether or not you have struggled with an eating disorder, her fears about her body are something almost every woman can relate to and this book has made Portia de Rossi more of a real person that I could imagine a celebrity to be.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  It's really an incredible read.

1457514508|4.0|I enjoyed this book.<br />The plot twists were inventive and unsuspected.  The setting was refreshing and felt authentic; including the two overseas forays the novel takes.<br />There should be a part two: lots of room for character development that could follow along the already well drawn lines. A little tweaking with the writing style could develop a novel that loses all trace of the authors hand and lets readers get fully engrossed in the story.<br />I don't read a lot of mysteries so I'm not aware of the different techniques generally used by mystery writers to create suspense, but sometimes I felt as though I was told (instead of showed) too much, and other times I felt as though the author wasn't giving me enough, or was holding back details like a cruel puppet master instead of giving me a little to let me make some of my own conclusions (maybe early Nancy Drew isn't a good basis for comparison, but it may be all my brain is going on when it comes to mystery novels).<br />Regardless, it was an entertaining read, and I was left feeling satisfied and wanting more, which maybe all we need to judge it upon.
