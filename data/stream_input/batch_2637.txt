B003477DVK|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect but I knew that it involved a dog so I was game to watch. It is a heart warming story about bullies and a dog and life's ups and downs. Great family pic but warning: keep a box of tissues close by!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Makes you think but not so hard you get frustrated. I hope it doesn't take too long for more levels to come out.
B005PK553C|5.0|traditional gothic horror blended with psychosexual plot lines. excellent cast. jessica lange dominates the screen with her determination to keep her family at any cost. the house itself is alive with evil and longing.  well done!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|can't wait for the series next season.  it is the talk of the town.  made me watch upstrs dwnstrs; all 7 years
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Thought you would have to have an awesome movie, with all these amazing actors but it was just ok. And that would have been fine if it was visually entertaining but I think it was made for 3d screens and you could tell.
B00C70FH7M|5.0|This album is the best of 2013, hands down.  The amount of depth in the music, arrangement, and lyrics is untouchable.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|This movie was just what I needed fun entertainment. I didn't have to think to much and it was good, I really did enjoy it.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The book dragged too much and the plot kind of got lost. I still think the first book was the best. I just read this book to finish the trilogy but it was somewhat boring and was not what I expected.
B00BW5K5DO|2.0|Directions as to how to play this game were almost non-existant.  I can usually figure out most games but this one became so boring with its lack of help that I am no longer interested in playing it.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I really enjoyed this series, I watched season 2 also. I am looking forward to season three as episodes are released.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This just gets better every season!  Zombies are just PART of the problem this season as the human camps battle it out.
B00B29J0I6|2.0|The constant pop-up in the middle of play are annoying and unnecessary! This happens as you are playing a level and continues on all levels especially upper levels and oftentimes multiple times during a single level. Will probably un-install.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love all the seasons so far.  Can't wait for Season 4.  The first season caught me and I couldn't wait for the following ones.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|A very engaging book; great strategies presented in such a way that I wanted to immediately embrace them and start down the road of becoming a minimalist.
B006RXQ800|1.0|I didn't finish the movie.  Toward the middle of the film there is a black man coercing Irish immigrants to vote, with a knife!  I figured after that the movie was going to degenerate into a PC revision of what actually happened.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I 've only seen first episode of season three and loved i1. I wish the whole season was free for prime members.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book too much to let it go<br />So I've decided that all the internet should read it to
B007REV4YI|4.0|i enjoyed it more in the theater, but still like having my own copy to watch from time to time
B009LQKHIO|4.0|This book was very enjoyable. The character development was great and the plot was heart wrenching. The only complaint I have was that the epilogue was too short and I mean short about four paragraphs. Without spoiling the story, I wanted one question answered. But I am eager to read the next book, so I'll see if we find out then.
B001PPLIEG|4.0|i enjoy all the James Bond movies, and am very glad to add this one to my collection as well
B004856SQ8|2.0|An incomprehensible plot, bizarre characters and a lot of in-house gags only cultish fans can decipher. No wonder the critics panned \\"The A-Team\\". But then, what did we expect? As I just said, it's The A-Team, not an epic poem by John Milton, LOL.<br /><br />In this re-imagined version of the TV series, Colonel Hannibal and his kooky crew of crazies fly with a tank, go on an original vacation trip to a German lakeshore, and in general make the world unsafe for democracy. Oh, they also destroy most of the LA harbour.<br /><br />Personally, I found this flick tedious, so I'll only give it two stars. But sure, if you are a hopeless fan of the world's strangest soldiers of fortune, or just hopeless, I'm sure \\"The A-Team\\" might just make your day...<br /><br />Don't you just love it when a plan comes together?
B009EHDU7U|5.0|The writing turns a quirky story into a believable but very strange experience. The novel took me into a different world.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I did like  the book, however, the technical descriptions were extremely long.  This caused to loose attention and skip paragraphs. I liked the book very much and compared to the movie it describes his feelings much clearly.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|This was a fun and light movie.  I laughed at some of the classic motherhood memories.  It was in interesting perspective how they included adoption and a miscarriage in with the full term stories.  It's not a very deep movie and there isn't anything to learn but it was a fun way to pass the time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app.  Very realistic and engaging.  My daughter loves it and has a great time playing with her horse.
B00COGXGNQ|1.0|The movie not at all as the story line in the book.  I was very disapointed. The movie was poor
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's not one of those games that you would sit there and play all day if you could,in my opinion.
B00BO2VKBG|5.0|There's not much I can say about the deserved hype of this album that hasn't been well-said already within these reviews.  I was fortunate enough to hear both \\"Blood Lust\\" and \\"Mind Control\\" for the first time in the same day and they hit me like a shot of heroin.  Two GREAT releases in one day; it was like Christmas.  Although \\"Mind Control\\" is a bit of a departure from the Sabbathy grooves of \\"Blood Lust,\\" this album is most certainly like the heaviest, doomiest Beatles album you've ever heard, but keeps the vintage style and songwriting quality of Uncle Acid's integrity fully intact while progressing forward beautifully.<br /><br />I also think it's worth pointing out that anyone who has a fondness for Alice In Chains' \\"Dirt\\" album should take a hard dive into \\"Mind Control.\\"  It EASILY blows away the hookless, boring, overproduced and overcompressed crap that AIC has been releasing since their post-Layne reformation.  There's a genuine realness with Uncle Acid and The Deadbeats that is painfully absent from great rock music in an era of digital fakery that I haven't felt in a long time.  It flat-out DELIGHTS me that this album and \\"Blood Lust\\" exist, so much that to keep things legit, I've also tracked down both releases (for a much heftier dollar amount) on vinyl.<br /><br />If you loved \\"Blood Lust\\" and are at all debating on purchasing \\"Mind Control,\\" debate no more and rest assured... you have another killer album from these guys within your grasp.
0345803485|4.0|E L James' book, FIFTY SHADES OF GREY, is definitely worth reading. Her method of character development is outstanding, and the book is full of surprises. I commend her for writing such a controversial erotic novel, and I have to say she inspired me to write erotica of my own.  Many people feel compelled to read the entire trilogy. However, I can already see where the plot is going, and I think I'm going to pass on reading the next two books because of this.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Best series, hate to see it end. Season 7 does not disappoint, can not wait for season 8, gonna be bittersweet.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Love the book and the whole series. The relationship that katnis has with the other characters is very interesting from a psychological standpoint
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|This book is an amazing dystopian society book! Must read! It reminds me of the book matched. Anyways, its amazing, you must read it. I personally think the best quote is<br />&#34; But i have a secret. You can build walls all the way to the sky and i will find a way to fly above them. You can try to pin me down with a hundred thousand arms and i will find a way to resist. And there are many of us out there, more than you think. People who refuse to stop believing. People who refuse to come down to earth. People who love in a world without walls,  people who love into hate, into refusal, against hope and without fear. &#34;

B00C7KYXHW|5.0|When I first heard they were coming out with a television version of Hannibal Lechter I was skeptical, but intrigued. From the first episode through to the season finale, I was hooked! I have since watched and re-watched several times,each time picking up on something that embellishes the Hannibal series of movies & books. If you're a fan of Thomas Harris' characters from both books and screen this is a must see show!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|We've been to the door 7 but were stuck there without figuring out the number to retreat the key. I just don't hope we're stuck there for a long time and we will lose the interests for this game. It's a very fun game.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|If you are inder 12, never seen original Oz, and don't care about good acting, then you will like this. It seemed like a Cliffnote version,with pages turned quickly and the actors reading the lines for the first time. Director must have been some film moguls 5 year old grandson.
1587613379|5.0|The Ethical Slut: A Practical Guide to Polyamory, Open Relationships & Other Adventures by Dossie Easton and Janet Hardy is a fascinating look at different ways of doing relationships. It doesn't tell you how to live your life one way or another, but it asks thought-provoking questions that helps you to consciously choose what kind of relationship(s) you want, and it gives you the tools to make the most of said relationships(s).<br /><br />One of the main things I took away from The Ethical Slut is that I have, at least emotionally, been stuck thinking about life in terms of so-called \\"starvation economies\\", i.e., the idea that life is a zero-sum game and that if someone else has something that means there is less for you. While there are a few things in your life, e.g., time and resources, that are indeed limited, most things are not. There is no set limit of beauty, intelligence, sexiness or love.<br /><br />Another important point is learning to trust yourself, that you do have the skills to look after yourself and that you don't need to (and in my opinion shouldn't) rely on another person to take care of you. Learning to ask for what you need (but also knowing and respecting that that doesn't necessarily mean getting it, or getting it when you want it), daring to be brave and vulnerable by opening up to people, setting and respecting boundaries, knowing yourself and owning your own feelings.<br /><br />\\"When you respect your own limits, others will learn to respect them too. People tend to live up to your standards when you are not afraid to set them.<br /><br />To truly know yourself is to live on a constant journey of self-exploration, to learn about yourself from reading, therapy, and, best of all, talking incessantly with others who are traveling on similar paths. This hard work is well worth it because it is the way you become free to choose how you want to live and love, own your life, and become truly the author of your experience.<br /><br />A basic precept of intimate communication is that each person owns her own feelings. No one \\"makes\\" you feel jealous or insecure - the person who makes you feel that way is you. No matter what the other person is doing, what you feel in response is determined inside you.<br />...<br />The problem is that when you blame someone else for how you feel, you disempower yourself from finding solutions. If this is someone else's fault, only that person can fix it, right? So poor you can't do anything but sit there and moan.<br />On the other hand, when you own your feelings you have lots of choices. You can talk about how you feel, you can choose whether or not you want to act on those feelings (no more \\"the devil made me do it\\"), you can learn how to understand yourself better, you can comfort yourself or ask for comfort. Owning your feelings is basic to understanding the boundaries of where you end and the next person begins and the perfect first step towards self-acceptance and self-love.<br /><br />Perhaps the most important step in dealing with problems is to recognize that they will happen and that it's okay that they do. You'll make mistakes. You'll encounter beliefs, myths, and \\"buttons\\" you never knew you had. There will be times when you'll feel pretty awful.<br /><br />Knowing, loving, and respecting yourself is an absolute prerequisite to knowing, loving, and respecting someone else. Cut yourself some slack.<br /><br />Everybody feels bad sometimes, so you are in excellent company. And when you have the courage to be open about a vulnerable feeling, everyone around you gets permission to be open with theirs.\\"<br /><br />Actually this book is so quotable, my copy has many many yellow highlights. In this review I have chosen to focus on the parts that I believe are applicable to everyone (and I honestly do feel like everyone could gain something from reading it), it does also have plenty of information on ethical/consensual non-monogamy (in all its variations), as well as safe and safer sex practices.fe and safer sex practices.

It's a good thing that after playing for awhile it gives a message saying I am out of energy (then I get a message on my phone about an hour later saying I have more and can play again).  Pretty clever because it means I can never play too long at once so I don't get sick of it.

B00000JCB2|3.0|Back in 1999 I was a big Korn and limp Bizkit fan. Couldn't wait till this album dropped after the good three dollar bills y'all. It came out and the songwriting was better, the production was better and the band was better. Just a great rock, metal, funk, hip influenced album. Now fast forward to 2013 limp Bizkit is back together still making music but diffentley not the band they were. It still is a good guilty pleasure album if u want to pop in and just rock out for fun I still do on occasion. But to me the album hasn't aged well sounds sort of dated the rock, metal, hip hop thing is sort of dead now. When I hear a turn table on a rock album I sort of cringe because it sounds i hate to say it so 1999. But still a rocking album if u don't think much about the lyrics. The band and Wes Borland are stellar and tight as a band on every release. Some of Wes borlands greatest guitar riffs and creativity on this release I think. I do like Fred dursts voice just sometime not his lyrics. But his lyrics are heart felt, and honest and they come across painful as he sings them or raps them but always keeping a creative humor and clever way about them. Still love the band and their albums even if I get made fun of jamming to them in my car at a stop light!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is so freaking fun! i play it all the time. its so addicting. you should get it if you're reading this.
B000EGF0NW|4.0|Really enjoyed the story overall. The fact that it is based on authors real life story adds to the interest. Would have given it five stars but slow in places.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Wonderful acting.  It is difficult to single out one actor as the best; they are all amazing.  Don't start watching unless you are prepared to hooked; it is addictive!
0316247545|5.0|I bought this for my 10  year old daughter, who adores the show.  She has read it nearly every day since it arrived, and she loves it!  She takes it with her everywhere and has it out when she watches the show to follow which episode is playing and learn the words to all the songs.  Cost of the book is reasonable, the joy it gives her is priceless.
159463176X|4.0|In his third novel, And The Mountains Echoed, Hosseini once again demonstrates that he is one of the premier writers of fine literature. Most of his characters are very well-developed and ones the reader can fully empathize with as they experience their lives -- lives that are filled with a variety of trials and tribulations. Hosseini's dialogue is about as real as it gets in fine writing, and his narrative skills will make the reader feel every emotion as deeply as do the characters.<br /><br />Based on these qualities alone, I would have given the book a 5-star rating, which is the overall rating I gave to Hosseini's two previous books -- The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns. However, while And The Mountains Echoed was equal to these books in terms of character development, prose and narrative, it was far from being their equal in terms of having a cohesive plot. This is because And The Mountains Echoed essentially lacked a central theme. Instead of a plot with which the reader gets fully immersed, And The Mountains Echoed is basically a series of separate stories that jump back and forth over a wide period in time involving a large cast of characters whose lives are loosely intertwined. The result of this made for a pretty disjointed read for me. This was complicated by the fact that Hosseini used a writing style in which one paragraph told part of a story involving one character at a particular point in time, and then began the next paragraph with the story involving a different character in a different point in time. Further, by the time I finished the book I realized that the stories about a few of the minor characters were never concluded; leaving me to wonder what happened to them, and why were they necessary at all.<br /><br />So, obviously, And The Mountains Echoed is not a book without flaws; and as a result of these flaws, I deducted one star from my rating and give it an overall 4-star rating. Despite its flaws, I'd still recommend And The Mountains Echoed to anyone who enjoys reading a book that will touch you in many ways.ains Echoed to anyone who enjoys reading a book that will touch you in many ways.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved it so much that I finished it in a day! But that said, some of the levels we so hard that I couldn't figure them out myself. I had to look them up online!!! So if your looking for a challenging game, this is it. I've never played a game like this before so it's unique. I just love it so much! can't wait 'till new levels come out!!!

B00COHAUD4|4.0|Enjoyed the plot..not too scary or gory but interesting. Sustained my attention throuout movie and cast was entertaining. Would recommend.
B008JFUORW|3.0|If you thought the first sequel was darker than the original, the second sequel \\"The Hangover Part III\\" gets much darker, with several deaths including that of one poor animal. I'm not particularly against the idea of deaths in as long as they are funny. Unfortunately, that is not the case with the third \\"Hangover.\\"<br /><br />Actually, we meet the \\"wolf pack\\" again, but this time the story has nothing to do with \\"hangover.\\" Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and Doug (Justin Bartha) are threatened by an angry mobster named Marshall (John Goodman), whose $ 42 million-worth gold is stolen by Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong). With Doug taken hostage, Phil, Stu and Alan have to retrieve the gold, no matter what it takes.<br /><br />The script for the third installment is written by Todd Phillips, who also directs, and Craig Mazin, one of the co-writers for \\"The Hangover Part II,\\" but it looks as if someone has borrowed a storyline from some other action thriller. Some jokes are funny, and Melissa McCarthy steals the show in a cameo role, but the creative energy of the original is sadly gone.<br /><br />So, what you get here instead is the wolf pack members, now bland almost invisible with an exception of Alan. And lots of Mr. Chow. Both characters have become not only more eccentric, but darker and even meaner. This is not to say their antics are all unfunny, \\"The Hangover Part III\\" is not quite as bad as critics would lead you to believe; it has just lost the creativity and imagination that the original has.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|It took to much money, time and was too time sensitive the crops withered it kept throwing perils and you didn't have time to recover from one disaster before another hit. I ended up uninstalling it.

B005HED11Y|5.0|I ditched Cable about 3 years ago. I've had AZ Prime for about 2 years now and I've been working my way through a lot of classic TV. There is something special about Star Trek the original series. It commonly surpasses all modern television in moral compass and ethical consistency. Most shows pass the Bechdel test as well. Though a little campy and dated the basic storyline and plot for each episode is compelling and makes you feel like there is hope for humanity (a feeling I don't get from watching a lot of newer stuff).<br /><br />Guess my point is that Star Trek is great and it shows just how shallow and sad our entertainment is today that I have to go back this far to find a show that does not make me hate my fellow man.

1423113497|5.0|I have not read a complete book in over 13 years. I was tired of reading adult, boring books and remembered how much I enjoyed the movie when it first came out. I know that typically the book version is better than the movie version and took a chance. I am so glad that I did. I read through the first two books in a matter of days. I stayed up through the night, read on the bus, in waiting rooms, etc. Wherever I could squeeze the time in I had to read what happened next. Rick Riordan has become my favorite author and I cannot wait to get anything and everything else he is creating.<br /><br />It's not complicated reading but boy is it fun (and descriptive). And it puts the fun back in imagination.
B00AN0KGWE|4.0|This series has high production values, a touch of the supernatural and large doses of carnage and sex. Each week it surprises, and It's definitely not for the &#34;kiddies&#34;.  The acting is good, and if there is a mother and son team more vile than Lena Headey and Jack Gleeson, you would have to go back to the House of Atreus to find it!  I recommend this but it's not for the squeamish.
B000000XBC|4.0|This CD is a follow-up to the original Chronicle, which in my opinion is still one of the greatest compilations to be put out by any artist. Whereas Vol. 1 was primarily collection of the band's single sides (including most of the B-sides), Vol. 2 focuses mainly on the tracks that were only released on albums. The first three tracks here (&#34;Walk On The Water,&#34; &#34;Susie Q [Part 2],&#34; and &#34;Born On The Bayou&#34;) are three of the five B-sides that weren't on Vol. 1; the last two B-sides that were released by the group were for some reason (because John doesn't sing lead?) not collected on either volume. The rest of the tracks here, while they may not have been on singles, are nonetheless great tracks (most of them, anyway; there's only a couple that I don't care so much for). In my review for the original Chronicle, I mentioned how it was unusual for a band to be able to play so well, and for ANY artist to be playing EVERY instrument we hear on ALL of their recordings. Another thing I find, well unusual about Creedence (again, in a GOOD way!) is that they didn't put out one album that was a genuine stinker (at least not in my opinion). Most other artists do (and have done) at least one truly bad album, but not Creedence. (I think even the band's last album, Mardi Gras, is good, though I do agree with many other fans that it's their weakest album.) In fact, I think MOST of their best album tracks are present on Chronicle Vol. 2. Among the tracks here are several &#34;covers&#34; of songs originally by other artists, such as &#34;Good Golly Miss Molly,&#34; &#34;Night Time Is The Right Time,&#34; &#34;My Baby Left Me,&#34; &#34;Before You Accuse Me,&#34; &#34;Hello Mary Lou,&#34; &#34;Midnight Special,&#34; and &#34;Cotton Fields.&#34; Several of the remaining tracks are from the Pendulum album. In fact, between them, the two Chronicle comps contain almost the entire Green River, Cosmo's Factory, and Pendulum albums!  Although Creedence's VERY best tracks are on Vol. 1 (in my opinion), Vol. 2 is definitely a worthy follow-up collection. Minor update: &#34;Born On The Bayou&#34; was actually edited on the single.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Although I feel it's a total copy cat of Fifty Shades of Grey it does keep me wanting to keep reading.  I think there should be reminders of who people are and events that happened from book to book though.
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|What a crappy movie. Who in their right mind would want to watch a movie about suicide?????? I hated it. Let's see some joyful movies out there for a achange.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|ST again blazes a trail for the SciFi genre.  Second only to the Bond franchise, they have finalky broken free of the every-other-movie-a-stinker stigma.  Amazing, when you consider how bad the 1977 ST:TMP was.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I have read all three of the crossfire series so far and as I liked the third book I found the ending terrible. There was questions about a characters that were not the main that were left completely unanswered.
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|This DH offering lacks the cleverness of prior John McClane appearances.  The car chase is nothing short of a Groaner.
B00633W614|5.0|This series of novels by Jeffrey Archer is one the best I have read in a while. Each of the three leaves wanted to know more.<br />The author really know how to catch your attention and just when you think you are going to find out the truth, guess what you have to read the next book in the series. But that's okay because they are soooo good.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|Action filled, good plot, and kept our interest.  Additionally, succeeds in the daunting task of making Famke Janssen appear unattractive.
B0089LOG02|4.0|The book was well written and explored a subject I knew very little about, very well, I thought. I would definitely recommend this book.
B00D2K40WY|3.0|This app was fun the first time... but then it kept on kicking me out of the app, making me have to start over every single time I opened it. Cute makeup and dresses though.
193700788X|1.0|Do yourself a favor and listen to it on CD or digital download while driving. That way you won't waste precious time actually reading the book. I guess CH was obligated for a 13 book contract but that was about 4 books too long. Too bad, because the first 8 or 9 were really good. I don't know what happened but I have a feeling she just ran out of interest or imagination.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really am addicted to this game I play everyday it is my favorite game love it it is easy to play and very entertaining
B005MLOKXA|4.0|I was a bit surprised how much i ended up enjoying the show. At first i started watching for something me and my girlfriend could kill some time with but i have to say i really got hooked. Alan Cummings charatcer deserves his own spin off show.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Decent story line for the upscale and the advantaged...the things money can buy - conveniently located apartments, villas at remote resorts - help move the plot along. What's going to happen underneath-- is there any depth to these characters? Besides their ongoing phenomenal attraction and the consistency of their intricately described sexual escapades, lets get the story moving. What's next????
B005LAII08|4.0|I loved the movie! However, we bought the 3D version. In my humble opinion, some movies are amazing in 3D,  and other 3D versions just don't seem to add much. This is the case with Brave. I didn't think that the 3D version added anything. Don't waste your money on the 3D version - but definitely buy the movie. Every little girl will be in love with this story and it's characters.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this game of Solitaire because it moves fast.  You can choose a different background, back and face of cards--no boredom here!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i felt like a spy I thought it was a<br />fun game for maybe young teens. but it was still fun. i will continue to play.
B0068FZ0GK|5.0|I've watched \\"Field of Dreams\\" over thirty times and my affection, affinity and admiration for the story and those who made the film are timeless.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I absolutely love this country music group. They have the best songs, their harmony is like angels singing in heaven. I would not only recommend this groups albums to everyone, I would implore you to purchase it, it's absolutely beautiful!!!
B008KRJWEK|5.0|this is like totally crazy awesome you get zombie guts every were when you hit them. and it is super super crazy awesome.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|This was a beautiful love story. I was actually surprised how good the movie was, and how well the actors played their part. Would recommend this movie to anyone
B00CWY76CC|5.0|You really have to use your head in this game. It gets tricky but piece you start it gets easier. Please try this game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys puzzle games. This game is entertaining and addictive!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I had a lot of fun playing this game and not only was it challenging but it was also free!<br />I highly recommend this game.
B000091NON|5.0|5150 is the beginning of the Sammy Hagar era of Van Halen. It is much different from the music they made with David Lee Roth, but it is still good. My favorites on this album are, &#34;Summer Nights&#34;, &#34;5150&#34; and &#34;Love Walks In&#34;.<br /><br />I recieved this album in used condition, but you would never know. I may as well have opened it from shrink wrapping myself. No clicks or pops or visual scuffs/scratches.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|One of the better games by MobiGrow. I got stuck on level 10, but shouldn't have! Love to see more of these!
B0013KW0KO|5.0|I love this album. It is darker than the others and more heavy in places than the others. They say during this album is where Eddie and Dave were starting to have problems. It is also the only album where you will hear Dave say the \\"F\\" word; in the song, \\"Sinner's Swing\\" ;)<br /><br />I love the songs, \\"Hear About it Later\\" and \\"So This is Love?\\" the best, but the entire album is great.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Downloaded this app 4 times on android but it still does not display page writing on pages downloaded app for Ipad & works perfectly Web help from Kindle non existant
B000LZPYCI|5.0|The record itself was brand new in shrink wrapping. Great quality and nothing horrible happened to it during shipping :D<br /><br />The album itself was never one of my top favorite Van Halen albums, but there are a few great songs on it, including; &#34;Cabo Wabo&#34;, &#34;Source of Infection&#34;, &#34;Sucker in a 3-Piece&#34;, &#34;Finish What Ya Started&#34; and my wife's favorite, &#34;When It's Love&#34;.
1781162646|2.0|Unlike other Stephen King books, this book did not keep my interest. It was more like a basic murder mystery. The book was not scarey or intriguing.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This game is fun, challenging and addictive.  I've always played bejeweled blitz, but actually like this better. It's certainly worth the download.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Already had kindle books but moved over the the Google Nexus 10 tablet and love it.  Now I get to read all of my books from my kindle and still keeping the kindle library.  I do wish they had a way to cancel a book that you've loaned out instead of having to contact Amazon Kindle support to have them cancel the loaned out book.
B004EIZCPM|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie. However, I highly recommend it for people 14-15 and up. There was an excessive amount of, let me think about how to put this, sex, but no sex. It's what was the focal point of the whole movie so there is a lot of fake sex rumors being passed around school to keep Olive's &#34;harlot&#34; reputation. As long as you are firm in your beliefs and can handle it, it's pretty good. That's pretty much it, just keep in mind that the premise of the movie is sex, so there is a lot of innuendo and such.
B001N9ESQ4|2.0|The second in a three movie series.  Trying to get through the first two to watch the current one but they are not all that interesting.  Basically the whole movie is an ongoing conversation between the two main characters.
B00355L2TU|5.0|This video kicks your butt all while keeping you motivated to continue to shred those pounds. I'm still working on it I'm pumped in seeing what the other levels are further on. There are certain moves that were advance but the modified versions was my area. I would recommend it to another and you can't beat 27 minute workout either.
B000QY9WOU|3.0|Great Show! All the hits and more! As always, Cher employs great musicians and dancers. A very entertaining night of music!
B00AG297GK|3.0|movie but I got tired of it after a while because the funny scenes are spread a little too far apart.
B00594XOZU|5.0|A great way to stay in touch with scattered family in touch.<br />Easy to do by just reading what everyone has to say and  adding your own thoughts
0143117009|5.0|This is the second book I've read so far from Jared Diamond - the first being Guns, Germs, and Steel.  Each book is better than the last.  It's an incredibly detailed, thoughtful, dissection and synthesis of geopolitics, economics, geology, ecology.... He manages to convey a wealth of information and knowledge in easy to understand and accessible language.  I can't recommend it highly enough.  Hooked from page one.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I rarely give books 5 stars, but I had to with this one.  Drew was an awesome narrator with his analogies and descriptions on how everything relates to something totally different.  Finally, the two main characters aren't the typical guy with a crazy childhood and the girl who is shy and meek. Neither are that and it was awesome to get away from those types. A great read.
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|This is a great movie! My husband & I highly recommend it!  For being an &#34;old guy&#34; Arnold still has it.  His supporting cast was pretty good too!  This is an Arnold kind of action film so if you don't like that stuff then don't get it.  We've watched it a few times since we got it!  That is how much we liked it!  As I believe Stallone said it is not deep.  Good guys kill bad guys...unfortunately as in most action movies a few good guys become collateral damage...but that is what makes the bad guys so bad!
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is a bit like white collar but with lawyers. It is a  fun show to watch. Really enjoyed it.
B000SEH80I|5.0|Excellent Read. Brought tears to me on many occasions but worth every tear. The excersises were extremely helpful but I skipped a few just so I can finish reading the book. I will return to complete them as they are very empowering and healing. I recommend this to anyone who has had the unfortunate experience with a toxic parent. This book is the real deal!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When you play this game you get sucked into the extraordinary feeling of the game. It is like you don\\"t wan  to stop
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Christian Grey has nothing on Gideon Cross!!  Eva Trammel is an awesome character too. I am addicted to this story!!<br />Hurry up ith the next installment Ms. Day.
B00AZRP2GA|4.0|Not that we should send the elderly into battle, but give them another chance to be useful.  like the compartison between realborns and the ghost batallion troops. Shame about lising so many of the original friends, seemed a waste of storytelling.<br /><br />Tempted to read the rest of the series though I'm not usually interested in series fiction.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great movie and being a Blu-Ray with Chris Nolen it has amazing clarity and and sound.  Nolen used an IMAX camera for almost the entire final movie so it really gives the sense of size in the major scenes and the sound editing is awesome if you have a theater.  Great movie - great series
B00002N9ER|5.0|I bought 6 sets of these because they are awesome! I only use 3 cell mag lights and these are perfect to mount to a wall in the basement in case of a power out you know exactly where your lights are. I have one mounted in my garage as well, and in my jeep to keep my flash light securely in place.
B006TTC54A|5.0|I bought this to show my teenage sons and they thought it was hysterical! I had forgotten some of the parts from when I watched it in the 80's.
B006PIXKVW|4.0|This story from the author of &#34;The Secret Garden&#34; has all the elements little girls love...a wonderful dad who is lost then found, a mean caretaker who gets her due, lots of good friends, exciting story telling during sleepovers, a pet monkey, and an exciting conclusion where the world is made right again!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was one wild and crazy roller-coaster ride.  I loved every minute of it.  It's easily one of the best novels I've read all year.  I loved the intricate plot.  The author clearly thought out every detail before she sat down to write.  I loved the amazing plot twists that I never saw coming.  I loved that the story was told in the first person, alternating between the husband and wife, leaving the reader to wonder if either was a reliable narrator.  I loved the fact that every time I put it down I started to wonder what that clue meant or how this person was involved or what could possibly happen next.  I never guessed the ending.  I know a lot of readers didn't like the way it ended, but I thought it was perfect for the characters.  This book was just plain fun to read and a real page turner.  I highly recommend it.
B000I9X7M6|3.0|Although I enjoyed the classic dialogue, the modern adaptation isn't quite what I enjoy.  Translating the text into modern language would not be Shakespeare, but it would have been more interesting and realistic.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|It's just a great movie good for EVERYONE in the entire family.  I can watch it over & over again & still find new things to laugh at.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|A griping tale woven through a writer and a man's beautifully unique life experiences. Looking back, what was also definable about this film was the intimate relationship these two men share with no overtones of homosexuality. I found this tale a celibration of male in an uplifting and positive light seldom seen in films today. In fact, what I more commonly interpret in todays media is the complete opposite. Religion is also explored in a substantive and respectful light. What a concept. Finally, and the icing on the cake for me, was the dignity and respect paid to love, relationships, our deep connection with the animal kingdom, and in the end this man's Family. I don't hand out 5 stars easily, and rarely take the time to comment about films today, but the quality of this one in particular compelled me to do so. This is an instant classic in my library. Thank you to everyone involved in this inspiring production.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|It is a great pool and the kids loved it. It blew up quickly and was lots of fun for everyone.
B009ARMS1I|5.0|Glee can do no wrong in my eyes... However as they begin to phase out the original cast of students it's hard to adjust to the new ones coming in, but I DO LOVE GLEE!!!
B0054KCGCG|5.0|A must read for any business leader<br /><br />It is full of excellent ideas strategies and a fresh way to think about any business
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Tom Cruise is... well, Tom Cruise.  And despite his personal histrionics in recent years, he remains a professional when it comes to the field of acting.  While family members have/had read some of the books in the series, I had not.  Despite that difference, the film was enjoyable for all.  Cruise takes you on a dramatic set of twists with just enough action to keep you guessing up until the end.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I love the characters and the story lines in this series. The writers always throw twists into the plot that add interest. Favorite plot twists this year (without giving anything away), Matthew and Mary, Bates and Anna, Thomas and O'Brien, Sybil and  Branson. If you haven't yet, it's time to watch. You'll be hooked too.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|James Franco is an actor that hits you as either spell-binding or over-reaching in his performance.  I genuinely cringed during some of those moments in 127 Hours.  And he portrayed a genuinely interesting friend-turned-bad-guy in the Spiderman series.  Now, this seemed a bit of an odd role for him if you are stuck in his Pineapple Express, pot-smoking days as a thespian.  So, step outside of your comfort zone.  It is an interesting take on the set of Oz stories.  A bit campy at times (thanks to Zach Braff who will never shed his cheeky ways) and a bit odd when you throw Rachel Weisz into a role that she seems unaccustomed to... or perhaps I haven't seen enough of her film work.  You might wonder why it merits only three stars in my opinion.  In a word... Disney.  The film is good, not great.  It's slightly above average, and certainly not part of the common swill that Hollywood is generating.  That being said, Disney tacks on their &#34;we are better than everyone else price&#34; and all films they produce automatically get a -1 star rating from me.  Go check it out at your favorite retailer.  I guarantee the retail will be $30 at a minimum.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The third installment of the Bared to You novels does not disappoint! The story progresses and the sex is steamy, as always- do not miss!
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This is not your average zombie film.  Borrowing heavily from the genre in order to tell a love story, this film follows an interesting set of twists and turns taking you by the hand through the life of a zombie.
B0083GQKQG|4.0|This is a great, yet haunting story.  When I read the book a few years ago, I was very impressed..The movie follows the book pretty well, but it just doesn't capture the essence of the story as well.
B00BI745AA|3.0|While it seems that there have been at least three or four versions of this film in recent years, this one excels in its mediocrity.  The actors (and actresses) are clearly thrown into roles that call for professional singers.  And despite the eye-catching number of stars in such roles, the all-star cast proves lackluster when it comes to belting out the songs that have made this play so memorable.  To be fair, the younger set of stars (Gavrosh, etc.) do an admirable job.  But that's probably because they don't have the name recognition as the headliners.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love period pieces, so this one is just a no brainer for me to watch and get into.  You love or hate the characters and the setting...  It's everyone's dream of what England might have been like.  I just love it!
B003ZZAXNG|1.0|There's a reason syd  barrett was kicked out of Pink Floyd. He is perhaps the most overrated mucisian of all time. He could play the hell out of one chord (as witnessed on the piper at the gates of dawn) I'll give him that. Aside from forming and being responsible for introducing everyone in Pink Floyd, his writing and musical talent is very limited.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|We bought it for her slumber party and none of the girls had seen it yet.  They all loved it and are obsessed with it.  As the mother, I found some of it to be a little adult for a group of 11 year olds.  The flip side of that is that I laughed out loud a few times.<br /><br />My daughter loves it and wants to watch it multiple times but I can't watch it again...haha.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is fun and addicting the stuff is a little pricey but still a well thought game. Good job (:
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. The acting was marvelous, I applaud the director and the A-list cast for the wonderful performance. Although the story line constantly changes the plot has a nice flow to it. My only regret is not watching it at the theater.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|A fast paced series with twist and turns with forbidden love. This book leaves you hanging on every word. O
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I can't seem to get past/future ongoing radar reports like I can on my I-phone.  It's slow, and and it doesn't keep the current time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this app.very addicting.great graphics on the kindle fire and the phone.you won't be sorry for downloading this game.enjoy hours of fun
0070511136|5.0|I've taken many sales training courses, and most had some good suggestions to consider.  Though few of the things &#34;learned&#34; were retained more than a few months, I found over two decades in sales that all these courses, as a whole, contributed to my effectiveness.  However, had I read SPIN Selling when it was first published I could have stopped there and invested my time more wisely mastering that process alone.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book. It was just as good if not better than the first. The main character is so easy to relate to that sometimes I feel as if we are the same. She is just as confused as I would be if I were one day have to run a country yet she is just as young spirited and mature as the person I want to be. She faces tragedy yet puts other before herself and I love the every minute I get to read about it. I would recommend this love story to anyone who loves romance courage the ability to stand out and stand up for what they believe.
B0015346OM|5.0|Was a very good book. Enjoyed reading it on my kindle. Nothing like what the movie shows. Very shocked to read some of the book and go back to the movie and see the difference.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The First three levels were really easy but then the fourth level was where the challenge really began for me. This game is really well done and a bit addicting to play but can get a bit frustrating if you let it.
B006IGZX0C|5.0|Impressive performances by all. Highly recommended for young viewers to see what it was really like in the 50's and 60's and how some people, by ignorance, were raised to believe there was a cast system in our country.
030789701X|3.0|It was definitely very informative yet it seems to just miss ...it dId not seem to warn you on some of the glitches or how to fix them . Illustrations were great !!! I had planned on keeping this version as a collector but the edges arrived broken .would have loved more bookmarks
B0062QRTKA|3.0|its an ok game. this is coming from the perspective of a parent. the kids found the game hard to interact with and starting it was difficult. I would not recommend for children under 5. however i do like the concept here.
B000002MX7|5.0|Love Chaka, but there are a few songs missing so I ordered &#34;Rufus&#34; to fill in those, like &#34;Once you get Started.&#34;  The quality of the CD is excellent and I am enjoying Chaka as always at home and in the car.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Looked like a really cute game;  but all sot was trouble...  The game kept on freezing and then it would shut down and go back to the main scr een.  NOT! MUCH FUN!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I truly love this game it's just frustrating that every time I get the coin that triggers the bumpers I don't have enough coins to really do any<br />damage...
B00993I6D2|1.0|Disappointed on what it really was all about. It was about Communism and brain washing the masses at all times.
B00000IQW5|5.0|The title says it all.  What a beautiful and quirky love story.  The character interactions draw you right into their reality.  It's not a &#34;fairytale&#34; love story ... it's better... and whimsical to boot.
B005PK57IK|4.0|The Good Wife serious breaks the mold of the average television series that doesn't make it past three or four seasons because of failing character growth or lack of motivation by the writers and producers.  Increasing exciting and you won't accept being interrupted!!
159463176X|5.0|The way he tells the story is so poignant, spanning the generations. How each character is linked to the other in such a special way and they don't even realize it. Very, very hard to put down once you were reading it. The sad parts are deeply felt while at the same time are achingly happy and peaceful. It made me cry more than once but the tears were not tears of sadness.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who is not fearful of feeling joy and sorrow at the same moment.<br /><br />Khaled Hosseini has a very special talent and the world is very lucky that he shares it with us all.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|As Alicia deals with the delicate balancing act between her personal and professional live's, the forces that be are seriously testing her will and resolve. Her performance in the court room is exciting.
B00933JF74|5.0|This game has a learning curve. Just a heads up. It is great fun though. The best part is that it doesn't expect you to pay real money for everything like Oregon Trail does. For this reason, I bought the premium version. This developer isn't greedy and that should be rewarded.<br />Thank you!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is a nice way to create something pretty without having to focus too much energy on the game. I play while the TV is on. The music is nice and its a whole lot less work than a real reef aquarium.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|after months of waiting for the book to finally be released from delayed publication date: the book itself was great but the saga still continues how long before we have to wait for the next book . Enough Sylvia let us finish up with Gideon we need to know how the story ends
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Rick Riordian paints another masterpiece in this book.<br />The ending is mysterious and left me with only 1 question:<br />WHERE IS PERCY?!?!?! If you have never read this series,<br />or the prequel series, then there is serously something wrong<br />with you (no offense).
0770435726|3.0|Since this is a first novel, I think that an allowance must be made for the rambling style and the less than stellar writing skills.  I thought the story line was an interesting one and the setting including the ambience quite well described.  However, the story line was very amateurishly developed and there were too many subplots.  At the end I wanted the story to end, but still had to wait.  I think that the author may in the future develop an interesting idea into something better.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Although I sometimes do not catch the words since they are spoken in the &#34;King's<br />English&#34;, I loved all the series.  The droll humor of Maggie Smith is precious.
B0094MB298|2.0|Bad Teacher is not a great film but it does have some funny moments. The interesting thing about the film though is that Cameron Diaz's character does not change. Instead, she gets away with almost everything.
B00B2DSK06|1.0|Wreck it Ralph didn't download, so I can't give you a rating. Through we download the movie, but I got the bill one was 3.99 and one was14.99, I called and amazon was going to refund my  credit  card for the last  amount, so I don't.  Have the movie,
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I wasn't expecting to like an early 19th century show but since everybody was raving about it, I decided to give it a try and I ended up glued to the tv. It's very entertaining, great story lines, actors, costumes, etc. I really liked it and now I'm waiting for the new season, I highly recommend it.
B003ELY7PG|5.0|Laid back approach to business, often CEOs live in a state of rush and panic.  It great to be reminded not to sweat the small stuff...
B008XG1X18|5.0|Originally I was skeptical about what I could get out of Pinterest. However, after a few months of use, I have found it to be a great resource as a Game Master. Yes, you heard right, a great resource for D&D, Pathfinder, ShadowRun or any other RPG, need a Location? an NPC? Treasure? Dig around Pinterest and you'll find images galore to fule your imagineation

B004SD5GZ4|3.0|the de facto PDF reader, the mobile app has been quite useful in keeping track of bookmarks I put in PDFcopies of game books. the text flow view is quite awesome when you want to read material and not be bothered by the graphic layout, images or other fanciness they over add in RPG books
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Book 5 was awful. The 1st 3 books of the series were so good! Book 4 was ok. I could't believe I was reading book 5 and then there was the epilogue! I don't feel there was any end to the story. My only hope is that there is another book to finish the story and tie things together.
B005544V6A|5.0|Recently just started watching Suits. I am in love and addicted, I can't wait for the new season to start. The characters are very well written and developed. One of the best shows on tv right now!!!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Wonderful book, touching and intriguing. You have to be on top of the unique character names to keep the story together, but a overall great read!.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm going to tell you the whole lame truth here. I discovered the \\"Wool\\" series while looking for knitting books. I'm not sure I would have noticed it had it not been for the name.<br /><br />\\"Wool\\" was amazingly good. I can't wait to read more from Howey.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Perfect for kids or adults. Love the Granville type feel,but with sea l I feel. Love that the main characters from Finding Nemo are all there. :-)
B00846REIS|2.0|I would like to think that a strong, but \\"broken\\" woman wouldn't be so willing to give herself over, to be controlled like that. The characters are too inconsistent. Especially towards the end. Not really impressed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game ,it really gets your brain working with its clever puzzles to get you to the next level.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I loved this movie.  It's a bit confusing at first, but is really pretty brilliant once you get into it.
B0015DROBO|5.0|If you're not into reading details this book is not for you. Intense, and action packed You will like it better than the movie.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I cannot play the game because I cannot read the print on my 8.9&#34; kindle fire! I have no trouble with other games, but the print on this one is so small even my sister could not read it using a magnifying glass!  If you can't read what they want you to find how can you play, I don't think this is a Kindle issue, it has to be the game, I have many other games with no reading problems.
B0085YOD1A|2.0|THIS APP, excuse me, I don't find it to be very accurate. If I could take it off my Kindle HD, I would.
B004MGMJ3E|5.0|I first became interested in PB and this release when I heard that Pete (Sonic Boom) Kember was producing it. Prior to that I had only heard of Animal Collective and certainly didn't know who Panda Bear even was. Good thing. Thanks to Pete I checked out a song on Youtube, then another, then another. Then I went and bought the CD!! It's thick atmospherics and waves of sound pour over the distorted vocals (that sound like hes singing inside a church, empty in the first rays of morning sun) hypnotizing you and drawing you in. The overall feel is a sorta hushed psychedelia riding along on a meth-distorted mix. The cd flows nicely and ends beautifully with the song Benfica. Opener You Can Count On Me, Tomboy, Slow Motion and Afterburner are my favorite tracks that make this cd a refreshing change when you want to listen to something &#34;different&#34; and beautiful. One of the best cd's I have bought in a while. If you are a true fan of alternative music check this out
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the main character, Katniss.  She is a very strong young woman, who is tough as she is kind and compassionate and very lovable.  It's this character traits I think that make the movies other characters come alive.  This movie made me big Jennifer Lawrence fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is super fun! Great game for passing time,it never gets boring and isn't to easy or hard. The farther you are in the game the more your scenery changes(:
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|When this movie first came out, I was not interested in seeing it with my kids. I was pleasantly surprised by the actual story and how much we loved it. We will watch it again and again on the digital copy we also purchased.
B006M4F67A|4.0|The game allows your mind to have a good workout.This will help you to prevent your mind from going blank.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|You really have to think with this game. I wish there were a solution page for those I can't figure out.  But it really keeps you going back to it.  :)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's very cool and fun to play and fun for my little brothers as well because the uhh like playing it too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is awesome! I am so close to unlocking tricky and knave already spent my coins on a bunch of characthets! If u love temple run you will like this1<br />. 00000000000000 times better
B000NDMRCS|5.0|It makes you think what would you do in the same situition?It keep you on the edge of your seat and i am so glad i made this purchase. This could really happen!
B00BLYFDO2|4.0|You are buying this because you already know about the legendary mr osterberg. One of detroit's finest humans. If you liked the stuff before then you'll like it now
B0039NJTLQ|5.0|Great all around production.<br /><br />Casting Tobey Maguire opposite Jake Gyllenhaal as brothers was perfect. They could almost be twins!<br /><br />Bailee Madison won a Critics Choice Movie nomination for her work as Isabelle Cahill, the older daughter of returning Afghanistan War veteran Captain Sam Cahill (Maguire).<br /><br />Yes, there are stronger productions dealing with the consequences of PTSD for both the soldier and the soldier's family but the \\"Brothers\\" approach was unique, acting as a familial support group. Such support is very often lacking due to the mental toll of PTSD and the length of time required for treatment. The family toll is often as unbearable as the person with PTSD.<br /><br />True that it could have gone deeper and true that the ending was a bit Hollywoodesque but in my opinion, neither distract from the excellent acting and direction.<br /><br />A great film for those who like any of the actors, Maguire, Gyllenhaal, Natalie Portman and follow the career of Bailee Madison as well as for those who follow films dealing with the devastating effects of PTSD.
B001XUJNJ0|5.0|A great strory and great actiing. One of the best I have seen in a whiile. Too bad that movies like this are no longer popular.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|If all you want is a quick way to do basic mathematics on your device, this will work for you.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game Is very adventurous and extremely fun to play! I would recommend this game to anyone who likes adventure games !
B003WH765U|5.0|Very interesting story that remains a classic. Nice portrayal of the differences of Asian and Western culture after WWII. Forgot how great Marlon Brando was. This is a classic movie you must see.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|PRODUCE RUNS MOST OF THE TIME. ONCE IN A WHILE THE GAME HANGS UP LOSES CONNECTION AND YOU MUST EXIT GAME LOSING ANY POINTS OR CREDITS EARNED.
B006LSZECO|3.0|A geat read until the last two chapters... story is compelling characters are fully fleshed out .  The adventure is a roller coaster that  takes you to the highest peak. Just when you are ready for an ending befitting the journey you left without cermony in an ending that feels as if it were just added on to the story.<br />I loved the back and forth writing style a chapter to ech character to build our involvment with each.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This has been a great game!  Each level definitely gets progressively harder.  I've really enjoyed playing and solving each level.  Thanks for creating this!
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|They completely lied.  The app is not free.  You begin to use the app and find out very quickly that you have to PAY to &#34;PLAY&#34; (so to speak) to use.  Not my kinda bait and switch app.  Do not recommend
B00CBLQCO4|5.0|One of LeCarré's best, a really chilling story and told with the usual articulate class.  I would recommend this book even to those who don't necessarily like mysteries.  Brilliant!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie, as we have most of Tarrantino's films.  It does go quite over the top in terms of the stylized gore during fights and the shootouts, but hey, that's kind of his trademark.  Our favorite character was probably the German bounty hunter...brilliant performance!
B008JEJOAG|5.0|This is my first pair of Duets.  I've had several pair of the original design, but just wore one out and needed a new pair.  These things are just as comfortable but seem to me more durable on the bottom.  There is also clearly more ventilation around the toes with the bottom vents.  The BIGGEST reason these excel over the original is traction.  It seems like whenever it rained I would either have to face breaking my neck or leave the Crocks at home.  The tread design on these, at least from my experience, provides significantly more positive traction on wet/damp surfaces.  Now I just need to find another color combo!!
B000VMFDW2|5.0|It was a hard but good read. Watch the mini series and the movie rang true to the book. We should thank all those who have served and are serving our country.
B00AYIJJEQ|5.0|I can't wait till Season 2 is out! Love this show. So happy to own it as NBC cancelled the series. :(
B0044C5SCU|5.0|There are many times that I find myself saying, &#34;What the...&#34;.  Excellent cast and characters.  The show does a decent job of developing the characters, reinventing them, and then finding someway to bring it all back together.  Highly recommended for any sci-fi fan.
B0017I1FP8|5.0|Great score. Happy to add this to my collection for frequent plays. Hans Zimmer is the current master of orchestration
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I just downloaded this game the other day. I like games that you have to build up your town and defended. this is exactly what the game is. works great on my fire. I'm an adult and really like the game. oh, its pretty easy to level up as well. I also have not been tempted to spend my own money in the game.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|The best film dictionary any could ever ask for has. It is easy to navigate around<br />an the examples are comprehensible by a 3rd grader
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great escape game. Not too hard that I couldn't do it, but not so easy that it was no fun.  Good download, great download because it was free.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Fireproof  Games did a great job at keeping me intrigued through the entire puzzle solving process.  I enjoyed the mysterious storyline and  intense need to complete each phase in order to follow it.  I can't wait, of course, for the next game created by Fireproof Games!
B004N6369Y|3.0|I liked this the least of danielle Steele .it was so slow and dull in the beginning..Finally picked up.But I have read all her books and she is my kind of writer.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|hopefully is the truth... history is better than fiction, well done, acting is great! and the writing also great costumes!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love how it goes to different cities every month. I love that its in Paris right now because I &#60;3 Paris! I wish that there was was different courses beacause it get boring after awile. If there was hills or other Geographic feature I think the game would be more fun.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|My manager at work convinced me to check out the series. I love it. So many different characters and interesting stories to follow--and it always surprises. This show is so addicting! I wish we didn't have to wait so long between seasons.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|This movie is really good and shows how the wizard comes to oz. It also shows how the witches of oz came to be. Ive serene wicked the musical and that is a totally different story on how thw witches of oz came to be , but I liked them both and thought they had some similarities. Wicked showed how the tin woodman, the cowardly lion and the scarcrow came to be. Oz the Great and Powerful has hints of how those creatures came to be and I thought that was very creative. I really enjoyed Oz the Great and Powerful and think other people will too.
B002KKCVX2|3.0|I thought Teva was supposed to be one of the best sandals.  I expected the it to be very comfortable, but it's just ok.  The straps tend to be very noticeable, unlike other sandal brands I've had in the past.  I don't think I could walk miles in these comfortably.  I doubt if I'd buy another pair.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I've seen the movie and 10 other versions of it plus the musical Wicked and Oz the Great and Powerful and I think all pf them were wonderful. After reading the book I realized there was a lot of differences that weren't in the movies. I still liked them all even with the left out parts. I recommend this nook to all ages even under 10. It would be a great story time.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Enjoyed the message and the grandkids loved it to. Watched it with two different groups of grandkids. Perfect time with the kids!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love all the stories about Percy Jackson and all the adventures he and his friends have. I think it is good for any age except for toddlers and cant wait until the next book comes out.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Have read them all and watched her grow as an author.  This is her best one yet.  Read it over the weekend, only complaint is it wasn't long enough, but that's only cause I loved the characters and story so much.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The service was fast and prompt.  The DVD was in excellent condition.  The movie is great.  It was about how influential and caring the help were even though they weren't treated well.  Seeing it from the helpers point of view made it so powerful.
B00BZB1ME6|5.0|Just shared this w/my teen boys & they loved it.  Just as good as I remembered it.  Wax on, wax off . . .
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'm think this game deserves five stars because it involves your brain and thinking. The brain works in section s this game requires your searching and  it's like multiple scavenger hunts.
B004FVHBXY|5.0|Inception is a film about hacking into a person's mind through their dreams and either extracting information from the person, or implanting a thought into their mind.  A relatively \\"simple\\" concept or idea to follow.  The complexity of the film comes from the rules of what can be done, how the mind fights back, how time reacts differently and how there can be multilevel dreams (or dreams within dreams).  You may have to actually watch the movie a couple times to track all those nuances, but they are part of what makes the move great.<br /><br />The main story, is a tale of corporate espionage, where an idea is going to be implanted into the mind of the head of a rival corporation.  The sub-plot, basically reveals how Leonardo Dicaprio's character discovered that inception (the idea of planting a suggestion into the mind through a dream) works, and the consequences of that action.  The story can be hard to follow at times (especially the first time you see it) because it cuts back and forth between different levels of dreams and jumps between the two story lines.<br /><br />The acting in the film is top notch.  You see many supporting actors from the Dark Knight movies in this one.  Christopher Nolan is one of those directors like Tim Burton who uses many of the same actors over and over.  Dicaprio, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Ken Watanabe and Marion Cotillard are the main cast.  They all do great jobs in their respective roles.  I actually think the sub-plot involving Dicaprio's and Cotillard's characters was the most intriguing part of the story, and the scenes where it was just those two interacting were very powerful.  Many people know that the ending leaves things rather open ended.  I know some people hated that you are never given a definitive answer, but I like how the filmmakers leave it up to the viewer to imagine.<br /><br />The audio and visual quality of the blu ray is wonderful.  If you get the two disc edition (which is really three discs because there is a DVD copy of the movie included) you get the film and a disc of bonus features.  The bonus is a documentary that focuses on the science of dreaming, then a short animated story, some artwork, then trailers and TV spots.<br /><br />While there is a lot of subjectivity when it comes to enjoying movies even in general, that is definitely the case for one like this.  If you are a fan of Nolan's other movies, then I would say this is definitely worth a look.  If you are just a fan of thriller/suspense movies with some action in there as well, it is also worth a look.  There are a lot of special effects in the movie, but I don't think they took away from the quality at all.  If you love the movie, and want the most bonus material, definitely get the two disc edition and not just the single disc edition.s really three discs because there is a DVD copy of the movie included) you get the film and a disc of bonus features.

B000HC2PCM|5.0|Every song is a classic, I don't have a lot of his work so this was a great selection.The duets were very well done.
B0055SWM08|5.0|At first, this app was a bit intimidating.  The tutorial was helpful, but inadequate preparation for perfectionists like me who don't merely want to solve the puzzle, they want to do so perfectly!  So, I was happy when I found the reset button, delighted when I found that I could practice moves without penalty, and overjoyed when I realized that I could go back to levels that I had already completed, albeit imperfectly, for another try at perfection!  And of course all of this repetition enhances the learning process and my pleasure.  I love QUELL!  I've already bought the sequel, and am looking forward to a long, happy future with my Kindle and Quell.
B0095VPBFY|5.0|I am using this Processor for a low profile HTPC, connected to my 50\\" HDTV.  I am using this computer to stream internet videos, surfing internet and playing media from the local HDD.<br /><br />So far, it is doing it s job very well.  I was worried about the overheating issue as it is in a low profile case, typically runs with only CPU cooling fan and does not have additional chassis fans. However, no overheating is observed.  I used a cpu temperature monitoring software to log the core temps during the usage and found to be working in the normal range of 65 C to 70 C when Playing internet HD movies.<br /><br />The cooling fan is up to the capacity but little noisier.<br /><br />Very good price point and value for money as I bought this processor during Christmas '12, when it was relatively new in market.  Intel i3 was almost twice the price and would not have given me any considerable functional benefit in my everyday usage.<br /><br />This APU handles light gaming , photoshop and  AutoCad educational version with ease.<br />I would recommend this CPU to anyone who is looking for a decently capable processor at a reasonable price.<br /><br />NOTE - I had difficulty finding ITX motherboard with FM2 socket for small form factor HTPC, however I believe that I would have utilized this APU to its fullest potential when I had used a better, feature rich MO BO, which are usually larger.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This was not a very good continuation of book one and two.the ending of this book does not leave yu wanting more, just left a g gap to be filled
B00BDSRER0|3.0|I like Phoenix and think this album`s songs are pretty cool, but the bad quality of the mixing and mastering kinda spoiled the listening experience for me. Everything sounds cluttered and overblown.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Works good for various places I use my kindle by adjusting to various positions  which makes easier to use. And the cover is well made.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|Took a few pages to get invested, but it was worth it.  The approach was unique and was ultimately effective.
B003UESJFQ|5.0|This movie can be shown in various classroom settings at the college level.  It's hard to believe that it was perfectly legal to pay women a lot less, and a bit sad that most of the men workers were unwilling to strike with the women workers.  The movie also illustrates that some labor unions are uninterested in pursuing rights for a small group within the union.  This movie is based on a true story in England.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I wasn't sure when I first downloaded this but it's a very fun game. You can quickly lose an hour of your life with this one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun its kinda hard to put it down you just want to keep playing. ...... once you start you cant stop. good luck and have fun.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Absolutely luv this game!!! Diamond dash is one of the best games on lmy kindle and we play it everyday!!! Kudos to its creator and to all who play...keep doin the dash!!!! We luv it....
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game it is a lot of fun fav movie is despicable me :) ready for number 2 to come out.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I play this game all the time. The only issue that I have found it to have is that it likes to crash a lot.  I have taken it off my kindle and put it back on, restarted kindle, deleted cookies (or whatever the temp files are) and it still keeps crashing on me.  Some times it wont even start up and I have to wait an hour or so before I should try again.<br /><br />Other than the crashing I love this game and would give 5 stars if it didn't crash to often.
B007EECSFA|5.0|kate morton really captures the feel of the time and location with her wonderful historical fiction novels. i have read all her books and recommend them all.
B002XXNSF6|3.0|This is the first in a trilogy of movies featuring the same actors in the same roles across 20 years. A young couple meet on a train and spend the day together while falling in love. The movie is romantic and very dependent on the dialogue to create the growing connection between the two principle characters. Unfortunately, the audio was disrupted constantly from beginning to end. The video showed no similar evidence of disruption. The audio did not get out of synch with the video, but the lost dialogue was very frustrating. I would have given the movie a 4-star rating had it not been for the audio problems that continued throughout the entire movie. Such a dialogue-dependent movie suffers mightily when that dialogue is randomly and repeatedly disrupted.
B00CATSONE|3.0|I enjoyed the history portion of the book about Tesla. However, the majority of the book seemed to be more of a self help book focusing on genius and success which wasn't what I had expected or why I downloaded this book.
B00C4QPYJU|3.0|Pretty much exactly what you're expecting from this one. Stallone, arm wrestling, in a classically structured Cannon film. Certainly worth checking out if you're a fan of any of those things.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Like the fact that screen is large. Just basic, but great for everyday use. Another great app for your Kindle Fire.
B00CWV8X04|4.0|It is hard to review a movie like this in depth without giving away too much of the plot, so I'll keep this high level and not delve into the story line much. Suffice it to say that this is a movie where you need to hang on to every word to make sure you don't miss the twists. I really loved the style of the movie too which was I felt was a combination of the film noire genre with Hitchcockian handling of mysteries. The lead actors all put in good performances.<br /><br />Not without flaws or plot holes, but it made for a riveting evening-staying-home movie.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|the music and lyrics are perfect.  This CD is my new favorite and the more I listen, the more I like it.
B0068RHGJM|5.0|Its nice to see that they are still making albums. Not their best in my view, but none the less good.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|After reading all three books in the Crossfire series I'm beginning to feel like all the people in her book are real.  I'd recommend this series to anyone who enjoys erotic reads.
B00351ZUHY|1.0|this film tries to protray religion as fanatical tyranny and then provide a subplot twist to ease the insult.  Nothing but typical hollywood anti christian bigotry intentionally misrepresenting christian beliefs as restrictive and repressive self earned salvation from the world's evils.  It is basically an excuse to market then current music to increase record sales.
B005DJREJS|5.0|I loved every episode, my favorite characters were Jenna and the counselor. Great teenage show , about high school life/drama.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|music  what else can i say and vevo is the best i would really show it to my friends thanks
B000YJ54DU|4.0|Not the best of the series so far but a very good read. Reacher uses his intellect and physical gifts to stay ahead of the bad guys. Maybe a few more shades of gray in this book as opposed to the normally black and white Jack Reacher. On to the next!
B00C2VIA52|3.0|It is a great game as long as you can stay on. The servers seem to crash about 10 mine into play and it takes another 10 mine to log in. If it wasn't for that, this would be a great game.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|This may be the fastest paced book in the series so far. The reader once again gets a deeper look into Child's simultaneously simple and complex character. Wonderful plot and character development. On to the next Reacher novel!
B00B9HTK1S|1.0|Stupid premise<br />Too wordy<br />Unlikeable characters<br />Can't believe jr high kids are forced to read this garbage. Very disappointing read
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I loved the concept. It made me cry and laugh. I love how detailed Hanna is and how Clay goes to most of the spots to honor her. :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'm a big fan of puzzle games. I enjoyed how there were more than one puzzle to figure out in the rooms. I loved how this one had no hints to make me figure it out on my own. This was a fun challenge and I wish there were more levels!
B002PXKWQ2|4.0|I missed these guys back in the day, but have always heard of them. Don't know much about their other albums, but this one seems pretty cool. Only listened to it once so far, but looking forward to more of it and getting other albums as well.
B005DNPJKU|5.0|I saw  this  film when it  first  came  out, and  I admire it then as  I admire it now. This  film needs  to  be  always available to future  medical  doctors, because it  will teach  us  a great deal  of  compassion towards  patients  and  towards  the  doctors.
B00CF0VGUG|4.0|Whether you liked him in the old days, or found out about him during his 90s comeback, you'll like this one. Some rockers and some pop as well as a few slower tunes.
1616550414|5.0|Absolutely loved it. The book itself is beautiful, and the content is mandatory for any Zelda fan. Awesome. Great price.
B0016OOS16|4.0|I bought this as a present for my younger brother that is looking to go into 3D modeling and design for college and he really likes it. I had used one when I was in school and they where pretty neat, able to move around your model in CAD or Cinema4D much easier once you got the hang of it. Also flying around Google Earth is a pretty cool thing to show some people if they are not exactly sure what this thing is.
B0024FADAQ|5.0|Great family movie, one of the old classics,good to see it back on the shelves, good bit of &#34;clean&#34; science fiction
B00006L9ZT|5.0|This is a very nice &#34;traditional&#34; production of the Ring - and I believe a great one to experience for both &#34;newbies&#34; and those who are already familiar with the Ring.
B0042816YK|5.0|A heart rendering dvd, so sweet, really pulls the old heartstrings, I think all of us can relate in some way to watching this, great direction and julia roberts is at her best
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey fans won't be disappointed with this continuing saga of the Crawley family.  The setting and costumes are, as always, perfectly beautiful and the acting is superb.  My personal favorite is Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess of Grantham.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Insert  any plague, crisis, or event into this scenario that the currant media would ignore as they did this fictitious zombie war. It is not a stretch of the imagination to conceive that the result and response would be the same. Our world is ignorant of the process it would take to respond to that type of situation. We are too tuned into our microscopic worlds to pull together in a macroscopic event of this magnitude.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The Room is a thought provoking game with beautiful graphics. There is a box in the middle of the room that must be opened - doesn't sound too exciting - but the game captures your attention and holds it. The puzzles are challenging, there is a hint button but I did not use it, so I cannot attest to its usefulness.<br /><br />The game was worth the price, I do wish there was more chapters, am I am looking forward to the sequel and the proposed update.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I read this with my class of 6th graders, and they were spell bound!  The story of looking beyond the obvious.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun, find the object game. The game gets a little harder with each level, but not too hard to solve within 5 minutes. My only complaint is there are only 10 levels, so you complete the game too soon.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|If you have ever enjoyed a Follett book, this is a MUST read!  He intertwines history into a story that makes you feel as if you are really there.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|After the Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns I was rather disappointed with this book. I didn't at any stage get into it and I found it rather disjointed and confusing. This was due to the jumping from one part of the story to another. I felt as if I was starting a new book and getting to know new characters on numerous occasions. It did come together but it was an &#34;uncomfortable read&#34;. In fairness to the author I did read this in fits and starts but this could be that I didn't find it engaging.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Good time waster or plane movie, but don't plan a Saturday night around this one. Time to end this franchise.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Easy to use, easy to play. Even a preschooler can play it and play it well.  My son loves this game.
B0015DWJ8W|1.0|I bought this because I needed something to read and Murakami is one of my favorite authors. This book is utterly boring. It really is about running. Maybe if it was about swimming I'd feel differently but I couldn't get past 1 chapter before giving up.
0345803485|5.0|I got this book as a present from a close friend of mine who knew I loved romance novels. After all the blushing, thanking and driving home, I was able to read this book that weekend and wow! Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James sets you in a world where it opens up the possibilities of what can (and maybe does for some of you) happen in the bedroom, but also what can happen outside as well. From going through this story with Anastasia Steele who explores the erotic and falls for the deliciously tantalizing Christian Gray, readers will be left wanting more in what happens between these two opposites and if what they have is strong enough for them to go through anything.<br />E.L. James, you've just earned yourself another fan and I can't wait to read the next two books to this trilogy.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I think I still have 50 shades on my mind. So they story is to similar for me. Hope book 3 is better
B000FBJHZS|5.0|This is an exciting book. It kept me intrigued the entire time.  On the edge of my seat the whole thing.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|This is one of those shows that will be great forever. 30 years from now people will be ripping episodes off the Internet to re-watch.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was not to hard to figure out.  There were some challenges but after a while of thinking things through I made the connections.  when things get tough there is always the Internet.  Looking forward to new rooms.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|This is a great take on the classic trading games like dope wars but adds a great element of fun by letting you drive your river boat between locations picking up cash along the way. Lots of great voice commentary and sound effects make for hours of fun.
B008M7JODC|5.0|great with it being on prime- just be happy when the final season is available on prime. i would recommend this series for sure.
159463176X|5.0|This is a wonderful book. Well written as Hosseini always does with his other books..Sensative, delightful with a touch<br />of saddness. Hosseini is the best writer in my eyes. I have read all his books and have never been disappointed,
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I loved Half a Yellow Sun so I had to get Americanah. I wasn't disappointed. The book talked about everyday things from a different point of view. It reads easily but not like an elementary school book. I like books about other countries and even though this is fiction I have researched and forund there is some truth to the story.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I was so excited to see that they finally had Fairway Solitaire for the Kindle. I have it on my iPhone already do now I get to play it on both devices. My only complaint is that there is no daily game like there is for Apple devices.
B00C0UHGLO|3.0|For a game of such simplicity, the loading seems a bit excessive on my Galaxy S2. Players on higher-end devices may not share this issue, and the game offers some good puzzle-solving fun with simple mechanics that are at once intuitive and sneaky. Wins feel like triumphs, losses feel like challenges. If I could just jump into the game at a moment's notice, I'd have scored it higher.
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a great show!  We have good guys, bad guys, bad monsters, good monsters, technology, lack of technology, smart people and dumb people!  What else could you ask for!
B009NY43NY|5.0|Spoiler alert!!! The perfect ending to the series! Never wanted Sookie to end up with a cold vampire for the rest of her life! Now she & Sam can live life, have interesting odd shifter/fairy children & grow old together!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome. Very fun. It's great to pass the time although I find myself playing it because I want to make sure my horse is ok l o l. Highly recommended!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This story was definitely unique and interesting.  It was so well written I was quite literally pulled in to it.  Definitely a good read!
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|It was a good game, I was entertained and pleasantly surprised (it being my first G5 game) so I decided to buy the rest of the game. I played it for about 45 minutes after my purchase and the game was over. I will continue playing G5 games but I defiantly won't be purchasing anymore It's not worth the money.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Todd sounds GREAT!  Just like classic QR.  Amazing voice.  It's great to have the REAL Queensryche back.  This is a great rocking QR CD......completely unlike that piece of CRAP &#34;Dedicated to Chaos&#34; (aka Geoff Tate's ego trip CD).  Good stuff and a MUST BUY for QR fans!
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Pretty addicting but I don't like all the ads and the game producers constantly wanting you to buy stuff. Just let me play the game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game not too hard to figure out so it is enjoyable. The music is a little funky but hey not everything can be perfect
B00BB67UNW|2.0|The acting, lines, and setting were good, and Walburg played himself well -- as he does in every movie.  However, the writing and story themselves were pretty poor -- it was very liberal/politically correct, pushing political agendas and stereotyping characters along party lines. Hollywood is pretty far to the left, and in bed with both the Democrats and the gay agenda, so it's no surprise how they stick to demonizing the right, making the left out to be blameless heroes, and having good ol' Marky Mark drive the leftist propaganda home.  Basically, a bunch of gay and Democrat agit-prop staged as a movie.  If I had known it was basically a Democrat campaign video, I would have saved my money -- and you should, too.<br /><br />Liberal themes:<br />* Characters promoting the gay agenda, and even inserting the tax-funded gay activist group HRC into the movie<br />* Stereotyping the \\"conservative\\" politician as bad -- corrupt, murderous, \\"homophobic\\" and deserving of having his wife cheat on him<br />* Stereotyping the liberal politicians as good, earnest and \\"of the people\\"<br />* Rehashing the Obama campaign's taxation agenda in movie form
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Well written, visually pleasing love story about separation reunited and the friends you make in between. The movie was true to it's story and it's actors were articulate, imaginative and blessed by a roller coaster storyline.
B004FOOQV6|5.0|This is a very handy app! I use it constantly to convert everything! If you have been raised using inches and feet this app sure helps for metric conversion!
B000UJ48SQ|5.0|This movie does it all for me, my favorite period piece drama, best period costumes, fantastic soundtrack and so much more to list. This movie really takes you through a journey of 1700's-1800's Europe and flows through so many different settings so well. There is never a dull moment. The acting paired with the music was brilliant also.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Alone worth signing up for Amazon Prime; superb storyline, wonderful acting and characters one really cares about. I cannot wait to watch Season 4.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Well written. Believable characters. Suspenseful. I am looking forward to reading the remainder of the trilogy.  I very highly recommend.
B001974DG0|4.0|A  page turner . Koontz. Puts a sense of the evil of mankind with morals of men.l have read many of his books .l wished l could of gave it 4 1/2 stars
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|really like how simple yet challenging. takes my mind off of things and just let's me enjoy the game. highly recommend it, be forewarned,  you may have the urge to buy coins
B003730LRY|5.0|This movie never gets old for me. Every time I watch it I see something new. Oe of my favourites.
B004GYY714|5.0|You get to listen to music when ever you want even if the state. Is not close it plays as long as you got wireless
B000065U1N|5.0|This is one of the best war/military movies I have ever seen and from start to end is packed with tense action. If you are looking for a great movie to keep you on the edge of your seat you will not be disappointed with this movie in my opinion.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|What a challenge.  Never boring.  So many different patterns.  I have a problem at time to get to play.  Only one Kindle to go around.
B000TDGGRY|5.0|This book was awesome, and course I finished this right we the movie World War Z is about come out,  strange...hmm, but still awesome.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I personally love this game and my sister got me hooked on it and now I am addicted. Kudos to whoever made this awesome game.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Good with doing pictures. You can do a lot of cool stuff with your pictures. Very unique way pf doing it.
B0066W1AZK|1.0|Try again. Can't get it downloaded to play. Started a game, paused it and now won't load.get error message.what's the problem
B002L6I9Z4|1.0|Bought for my son as a Christmas present.  My windows 7 will not accept it so the only pictures are the ones on the camara on a tiny screen.  The manufactor was NO help and because I shopped early for Christmas I was stuck with it.  My advice don't waste your money.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Good twist in the middle, didn't see that coming. Both were psycho to stay together. Will read more from this author
B009XIXVU6|5.0|As good as he previous books, I have read all of them. A wonderful story. Another peek into the Middle Eastern culture.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|since I started the book I could not put it down untill I finished it. I really needed to know what would happen next and I dreaded it at the same time!
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|An awesome CD about the love of Jesus for us and how we can always depend on him.  Truly uplifting and inspiring
1574216988|5.0|Jam packed with plenty of Zentagles!  I would definitely recommend this book!  The author has taken a very fun approach.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a pretty good game to play. I have played it a few times and it still takes me a while to find everything. Can't wait for more levels.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I was excited about this game till it told me that I had to pay $5 for the rest of the levels that I felt were beatable very quickly. I did love the game but wish there was more stuff to it.
0920668372|5.0|I have always loved this book.  I have 3 boys and have given each one a copy when they had their children.  I want to be the mom on the last page.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This is a good app.....it is really fun! The only problem is I switched my account from &quot;Local Park&quot; to &quot;Facebook Park&quot;. Then I deleted my Facebook,along with all of my progress. :(
B000ICZD4I|5.0|It's all about life and finding your voice. It touches all of our emotions. I could say more but this sums it up.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really liked playing. I would've given it a 5 star rating, but I finished faster than expected. Can't wait for new updates.
B006I1OB0U|5.0|Did not realize that this was the special that would fill in between season 2 and 3. Fills in a lot of blanks you need to know about before season 3.
B000YJ54DU|4.0|This is a good Reacher book. Not the best, but then maybe I have become too familiar with the character. I enjoyed the new characters and I enjoyed the action. The female lead in this one seemed a little unclear, but then again most women are.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Love the settings, the characters and the story. Outstanding writers and the acting is the very best. Eagerly awaiting season 4. Be sure and get Christmas DVD in order to be caught up between season 2 and 3. The whole series is a real treat, especially compared with our choices in US. Thank you, UK!
B004N7977I|4.0|I liked this one. It was a good fright tale. I have watched this before & its worth watching a few times when ya want some gruesome stuff to watch.<br />I like this because it is a classic scary movie  with lots of gore.<br />When your surfing for something to watch & cant seem to find something this is the perfect one to pick for a late night fright.
B0052RDHTM|2.0|Sorry. Been reading his work since Eye of the Needle which was an all night read with all the suspense. Just cannot get into all the characters and different places. Seems to jump around too much for me and the history during this time was very sad and depressing which is the truth. I just need more of a positive read. I will still continue to check out this author though.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love love love this series. Love the history and the British perspective. I recommend this highly. I have watched it from the beginning via Amazon Prime streaming.
B007HACDLK|5.0|R I P Vince Flynn!<br />I have greatly enjoyed each of your Mich Rapp adventures!<br />I will now have to re-read them! JRT
B009E3EY38|5.0|Excellent recoding of an excellent gig. Jimmy Page's playing and the groove he gets into with vocalist Robert Plant is priceless. Plant's voice has held up very well. The band is perfectly tight for the main set - just a bit looser on the encore. This has a really great sequence of songs. A pleasant surprise was the inclusion of some tracks from the album &#34;Presence&#34;. Could go on and on...
B004K58GSO|5.0|I like going back in time.<br />picture super good.<br />I watched this movie more than once. love it.<br />like going to watch movie for 50 cents when i was a kid.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini previous books set a high bar and he has yet again delivered beyond expectations.  Hard to put down and well worth every minute
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I was not sure i would like it, because it was so fast. But once you get the hang of it, it is fun!
B004XZR63M|5.0|really really good a lot of new information I loved it. Robert is basically a genius Im already 1 and a half books deep into his other stuff.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I wanted to expand my high speed ports and this definitely does the job. It's noticeably faster than the 2.0. I'd definitely recommend it.
B0045L0D4I|5.0|My kids love this group.  The songs are catchy and sound good.  Which is a big plus, since we have to listen to it over and over and over again!
1480054542|5.0|This is a fun fast read with  the female protagonist being a survivor from an abused marriage. <br />In the aftermath of her brothers death she finds a new beginning and a new love. <br />This new love is truly a dreamboat. His actions and not his looks had me falling for him.<br /><br />So the problem- how can a woman find herself while redefining herself in a relationship?  Correct, she cant so out with the relationship for now. Destiny however has its own plans....<br />A nice read very well written and if romance is your passion then this will be the book for you. <br />WaAr
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I am disappointed.  McEwan uses this novel as an excuse to publish stories he's obviously written beforehand and tried to tie them together as the product of an aspiring writer.  It just doesn't mesh.<br />Furthermore, the surprise narrator revealed in the end works in &#34;Atonement,&#34; but definitely not here,  I think it was a bit disingenuous to try this trick a second time.<br />Such a disappointment.  I expect better from McEwan.
0307719774|5.0|I haven't been a journal keeper since I was a tween....every journal I've had after the age of 12 I just have never been able to stay engaged in. However, I am really thinking this one is a keeper! The questions are so interesting and refreshing, and its pretty cool that it has you thinking about your current life in a way that will allow you to look back each year when answering the same question, and see how much you've changed in terms of taste, style, etc. I am really enjoying it so far. Plus, the journal itself is small and super cute and looks very expensive and fancy. Only thing, I agree with others who said it should have a ribbon to bookmark or something. That would make it absolutely perfect, but even so it is a fabulous journal that I look forward to using for the next 5 years!
B0026QC0TA|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie, I missed for  some reason when it first came out and even so it would have been good to watch again.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|This app takes up way to much space! I deleted EVERYTHING on my kindle fire and it still wouldn't download! It's a wast of you time!
141694737X|5.0|This is one of my grandchildren's favorite book to read any time of the day!  It is mine too!  It always makes them and me smile!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I was a bit put off by the way the story was presented at first.  I was hoping for some dystopian end of the world zombie book like I'd been reading the last few months.  However as I continued the story reading the &#34;interviews&#34; and the way they were put together I realized this was a different type of book.  And it was great.  Amazing even.  Definitely recommended
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Have not read all yet, but would still recommend for both men and women.  I am not finished with this book yet, but am finished with writing reviews for Amazon. Thank you time wasters.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|It was pretty good all around,  this is the first movies (I have seen) where the zombies are still people.  Nothing GREAT but all around a good movie.
B002PEP4EG|4.0|Interesting insights on the values and practices of the IDEO company, which coined the expression &#34;design thinking&#34; and has worked on several different domains of wicked problems.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|This app is so nice... Whoever made this should upload talking harry the hedgehog on the kindle fire for free because these talking apps are wonderful.
0486448843|4.0|I find the color beautiful, so beautiful I wouldn't dare send one to a friend at all, but some are a BIT too dark. Most of the color is rich in most of the paintings, but the darker ones are a bit hard to make out at times. Still, well worth the purchase if you are a Waterhouse fan. An enchanting set of postcards.
B001GKJ2FM|2.0|There were times, while watching this silly film, that I thought it might win me over through sheer exuberance.  But ultimately, it was not to be, for it suffers from two jointly-fatal flaws:  the whole is less than the sum of its parts; and the parts are less compelling than watching old ABBA videos.<br /><br />I'll give one example of how the film works against itself.  \\"The Winner Takes it All\\" is a heartbroken lament by a betrayed woman as she parrots the cynical self-justifications of her betrayer.  It works (at least for me) because the heartbreak overwhelms the song and exposes the betrayer's self-serving cruelty.  Meryl Streep cannot sing quite as well as Agnetha, but she can act, and she acts her heart out while singing this to Pierce Brosnan.  But it is all for nothing, because the CONTEXT is all wrong.  He never betrayed her - it's all a silly misunderstanding.  And since he never said those things, the cynicism all comes from HER!  Whatever power the song ever had, it simply cannot survive this one-two punch of fake tragedy plus unsympathetic victim.<br /><br />This happens repeatedly.  Not only does the story fail to add anything to the songs, but it actually works against the ideas or emotions the original songs seemed to convey.  Lyrics make poor sense in light of the plot (a woman singing \\"baby I'm still free\\" to a man she just met; a woman singing \\"building me a fence, building me a home\\" about a summer fling where she slept with 3 different men).<br /><br />I won't pick on the quality of the singing, as some viewers do.  In fact, I think one of the most effective moments of the film is when the two sisters sing \\"Chiquitita\\" to Meryl Streep (badly, but with feeling!).  On the other hand, Amanda Seyfried sings quite well - but when she sings \\"I Have a Dream\\" I cannot remember why I ever liked the song.  Frida convinced me she really believed in angels, but somehow Amanda cannot.<br /><br />Nor am I sure Amanda's renditions are the real problem.  There is something subtly wrong about the context - an aura of sad, sordid despair, thinly veiled by forced joyfulness.  The happy twist that transforms the wedding banquet into a sort of PG-rated orgy, through the magic of Aphrodite, did not quite have the tone of innocent nostalgia that I was looking for.  I just thought, No good can come of this; they will all be miserable tomorrow!e is something subtly wrong about the context - an aura of sad, sordid despair, thinly veiled by forced joyfulness.

B009EHDU7U|5.0|Great fun and lots of &#34;I didn't see that coming&#34; moments. Just the thing to put a smile on your face.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and could not stop reading it! I highly recommend this great adventure for ages 10+
B003QS9WIE|5.0|A good story, well acted and some special effects that make you wonder just what Mr. Tesla could have been capable of.....
B00D2K40WY|4.0|We have been using this app for about two weeks now. We have had no technical issues so far. My daughter is four and a half and she loves it. She asks to play it daily. My only complaint is that there are quite a few items that are locked and you have to pay to open them. They are not cheap, you would pay a small fortune if you unlocked every option available. I just explained to my daughter that if it has a lock on it, it is not available. She plays with what is available and doesn't seem bothered by the options she can't use. Overall, for a free app it is quite good and my daughter asks to play everyday.
B000I3W1XS|5.0|Compared to todays hi-tech productions, it is a little old-feeling, but still, for the day, it was and is a neat movie. Spock lives!!
B000ICXQF6|5.0|I love this movie.  Great story and good acting.  Very exciting ending and one that makes you think after it's done.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Fifty shades darker is just an ABC script for a movie. Take this to the beach and leave it there.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Not the type of book I would typically read but it was our book club pick. Really enjoyed it. The author was really descriptive. I love a book that I can visualize the characters and settings in my head. This would be a amazing movie!
B00821OX98|5.0|Lots of fun to watch.  Great Plot and Story line, Acting reminds me of great series like West Wing and Hill Street Blues.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|This is my second time watching through this season and it's still as awesome as it was the first time around. The story lines are interesting, the acting is great and overall it's a lot of fun to watch.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis is Lincoln! It was such a wonderful film. The acting was outstanding by all, but Lewis was remarkable!
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|The most boring movie I've seen in a pretty long time. And I really mean it, a really long time.
B005MMY9A8|3.0|This is a fun action movie.  It lacks the character development of some if the character development that was common in the past.  Thus it's not a Casablanca.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Reminds me of Mario. This is easy and fun to play. Highly recommended! Hope that good ratings get more for the free version
B0067R0APK|3.0|The program is overall good, but I am having s hard time figuring out what I gained with this version over the free one other then ad free, which were not bothersome.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My brother sister and other brother and my cousin have it and it is so adicting and we play it as soon as we can so I rate this game to the fullest!!!;)
B0031RS8NK|5.0|I have read a few books by this author and this was one of my favourites. It was very cute, funny and enjoyable.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Let's me appreciate music. Love it. Not much to it, it's pretty simple to use. I don't really need iTunes anymore.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Always check here for healthy tips and research for the family and myself before running to the doctor. I recommend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome! You get buckets now and everything but there's one problem. Enderman he is cool . But I wish he was on pocket edition and nether portals
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Was really interesting and fun to read-I am iffy about trying new authors but this was a good summer read.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|This game needs more action and more missions I beat this game in a day it should have more places to go inside like a restaurant but it's awesome and needs more blood and needs more clubs to go to but this game is better than gta 1 and the cops aren't even in site until you kill or hijack something and no phones to call the cops if you play this games there's only one place to find a bus near the train station but that's what updates are for peace
B003YL4LYI|3.0|The previous volumes read easier-how do you say  flowed better. The TV series was more interesting...this volume has way less character development.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was awesome! Only wish there were more levels. Perfect for anyone who loves puzzles and problem solving. Great game!
B00CWVF2GC|4.0|This movie made it clear to me that Ohad Knoller is a fine screen actor.  I  have also seen him in Beaufort, Amir & Harel, The Bubble, and Yossi & Jagger - but in my opinion, his performance in Yossi was far superior to any of these.<br /><br />Given that many reviewers have written very convincingly about the major themes of the movie, I will only describe a few things that were especially enjoyable and touching to me.<br /><br />I simply loved the attraction/tension between Tom and Yossi as they spoke outside Yossi's hotel room, each of them planning a different diversion for the evening (DJ Tiesto vs. Keren Ann). With the following scene  -  Keren Ann's melancholic love song as voice-over to the view of colorful lights reflecting on the Eilat gulf - I was reminded of Jagger's erstwhile insistence that Yossi go with him to Eilat and &#34;share a queen bed.&#34; I then recalled the occasion of Jagger's death: Yossi was in charge of the army troops<br />when they went to fight that night, and Yossi was with Jagger as he was dying. It was no accident that Yossi sought out a profession with responsibility that also focused on physically caring for others.<br /><br />At the Keren Ann performance, two major changes simultaneously develop: Yossi allows himself to demonstrate his sadness (he cries) and the relationship between the two men begins to evolve. As Tom approaches Yossi from behind, Yossi seems to have regained his aura of strength - but also demonstrates his vulnerability. From this point on, I could *feel* the attraction between the men. Although previously, Yossi's weight was deemed unattractive (as shown in the online dating meetup early in the film), his size now seems to represent his solidity and strength - and a source of attractiveness.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I enjoyed this book, but the central characters Amy and Nick are both very unlikable ... Scary though, and so unbelievable it is believable. Like the way Flynn makes the Missouri setting a character as well.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is awesome! way better than 100 rooms. i enjoy the difficulty of the game but do not find it too challenging. wish it had more levels!!
B0055B7IPE|5.0|The characters in this movie are delightful and grow a lot in the telling of the tale. The dogs are wonderfully funny, and although they have voices, they are still very doglike. Ed Asner is great as a curmudgeon with a heart of gold, and the adventure is both fantastic and yet believable. A great romp from start to finish. Storytelling at its best.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Good Product it is stupid to require so so many words In a review it is a waste of my time that is why I don't like to review
B0049J2CKE|5.0|My sister has been to Paris several times, and kept remarking on how all of the visual details in this movie were spot on. The rats were very ratlike, although they were being humanized for the story. The mannerisms were just right. Pixar makes the best movies today, and this movie is another great example of their art.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Good Product it is stupid to require so so many words In a review it is a waste of my time that is why I don't like to review
B000I9W08I|4.0|I had actually never seen this movie, although I have seen parts of it before. When my sister was visiting, we decided to watch it for evening entertainment, and it was a nice, fun, and very colourful movie that had great production features and was just a delight to watch. Barbra Streisand had a great singing voice and this is a great movie to show it off.
B005544TRQ|2.0|I chose my tv viewing carefully and I thought this show was clever and entertaining through season 1. My only complaint would be there was too much unnecessary language but was willing to lower my standards for some entertainment that did not focus on the sexual relationships of the characters. What planet do these people live in that in a professional setting they swear in every sentence. Considering that they portray educated people, surely they use more articulate language to express their feelings.<br /><br />Season 2  however was just too much. Too much drama, too much personal angst and definitely too visually inappropriate in the last episode. I never want to watch other people have sex and if this is the direction the show continues to take, this is the end of me watching this series.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|Beautiful language.  Engrossing but petered out into a formulaic ending.  Took too long to reveal what had happened between Victoria and Elizabeth. This should have continued as a character study rather than a mystery. Last third was tedious and predictable.
B00003CXTG|4.0|Love the movie! This is one of those movies I could watch over and over. I bought for my home so I could.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Ultimately you come away rather discouraged if not downright depressed. Why? Because you realize there is not anything you can do...........except to be aware of these abominable conditions and support efforts to bring an end to these &#34;camps.&#34;
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's the best game I've ever played. Its got so many new things you can do and get with each update. Over all  I LOVE THIS APP
B003GYEGNO|5.0|The author really understands the human psyche. My own stomach was churning as I read how the 'master's was churning.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|its ok, just wish it were more levels. I like the concept of the game and the challenges that keep your mind wondering!
B000K3M1VI|3.0|Meryl does provide a great performance. Kevin Kline is Kevin Kline--but we adore him in &#34;Fish&#34; and &#34;French Kiss&#34;.<br /><br />Not aligned with the novel, but effective screenplay, if overly long and overly focused on Stingo.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This is a good idea for changing our habits, if you decide change your some of your habits,  you should design a good cue for it. I hope you can, if you want to.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Was having fun until the update... Now game won't load and after spending money on sand dollars, alge and pearls to build my reef it's gone and I can't even get the app to open. Very disappointed!
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Other users are correct: you need to play this via Facebook.  NO THANKS, people! Do not try to suck me into Facebook, not even to play a new app of Angry Birds!  I'm deleting this one.
0440246318|5.0|Fast pased and very entertaining.  Have read all the Reacher books but refused to see current movie as I was terribly disappointed with Tom Cruz as Reacher.....It was a real &#34;reach&#34;.
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|Watch it - you will love it. Great characters, great acting, great show.  One of my favourites.  I can't wait for season3
0307476073|3.0|Read for our Book Club but would not have chosen to read on own (which I think is the reason for book clubs).  Had some good areas for discussion but was not one of our better books for active and lively discussions.  Self punishment is not a good way to deal with her challenges though for her it worked.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The whole series was an intriguing story that continued without repetition from book to book.<br />the characters were developed evenly and are distinct enough to be memorable.<br />A truly epic fantasy world that was a joy to visit.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|As I read the book, I became more interested in Steve Jobs, not his products. How he grew up, choices he made, his interactions with his friends and family. I honestly believe a person needs to partly crazy and self absorbed to be great at what he/she does. If you're not paranoid, or demand the best from people, life simply becomes another day.<br /><br />Thankfully there are many others like Steve Jobs that have yet to be discovered............
B00CF34B2I|5.0|great game. handles well on a kindle. easy to read the cards and sealed draft is fun.<br /><br />cant ask for more.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|WARNING!!!! : VERY ADDICTING!!!! This game is very fun. I l&lt;3ve this game. I recommend it. it is an amazing game for any.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Love this game I enjoyed making the reef for all the new fish. It is fun watching the fish swimming around.
B001KZG99A|4.0|This is a good movie, a little scary for littler children who want to see it because its about a Superhero.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love the way Hosseini writes. I've read his other two books and only hope there's a fourth one on its way. All his stories touch your heart. It was wonderful.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|My 10 year old son likes it. I think a little cheap, but he likes it.<br /><br />I can se the pen running out quick
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I downloaded this product in the Free version and found it satisfactory. I choose to upgrade and performed the download, but then I received from a message from a security program on my phone (Lookout) warning me that this app was known to contain malware and should be removed. Of course, I stopped the process and didn't install the new version and removed the free one as well. Using the Customer Service part of the Amazon site, I immediately wrote an email to Amazon explaining the issue and requested a refund, but I couldn't get the note to be sent. My computer is new and has been sending emails and working fine, so I can't explain the problem; therefore, I'm requesting a refund through this Review site.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|It's a blast to use with groups but I wish it could due more with voice mimicking.  After you have passed the phone around and everyone has heard themselves, it gets old fast.  Some variation would be nice.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is totally amazing. I like temple run so I decided to buy this and it was way better than the original. I love it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This story is riveting and I just couldn't put it down. Each page left me wanting more. I recommend it to absolutely everyone and I can't wait to read the sequel. Both my daughters told me it was an excellent read even though they both know it is not my normal genera. Bot it is truly orbiting
B00AMBH70S|1.0|Incredibly slow first 3/4 and then a single chase with a Deus Ex Machina moment where the script writes drops in, oh surprise, a \\"new upgraded model\\". Fancy. Not a worthy successor to the originals at all.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|For those of us with hearing problems, or if you're just not sure what the English are saying, this version HAS SDH (Subtitles for Deaf & Hard of Hearing). Colors are luscious. This is a favorite of my wife's, OK, I'll admit I enjoyed it too.<br />I'm hoping these Brit producers get the idea that SDH is needed for most of their shows. Even BBC America had a &#34;Closed Captioned&#34; campaign to gain viewers. There are so many other wonderful British mysteries that I wish were subtitled.<br />Have fun with this show!<br />M.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Building Your Book was essential for me to get the HTML commands coded for hyperlinks from the Table of Contents.<br />The book did not exist in 2006 when I first published, so I was thankful to be able to publish a new edition with added features.<br />Also, formatting was a mess in my first edition.  This guide helped me cope with the Kindle translation of my writing and photographs for Greatest Hikes in Central Colorado and Hiking Colorado:  Holy Cross Wilderness.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I haven't played this old fashion solitaire in years Brought back my childhood memories.  Great and challenging game. Il's harder than it looks, but a great deal of fun.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|This APU is just freaking awesome...I am able to play Planetside2 on all the &#34;high&#34; settings with a discrete ATI HD4870x2 GPU PCIe card and the &#34;One Click&#34; overclock available from the MSI FM2-A85XA-G65 motherboard...without the card, I was still able to get decent FPS with the &#34;on chip&#34; graphics, so its a &#34;no brainer&#34; if you are looking for a budget gaming machine setup...save some cash and get into The Game!  As I was worried about the APU running hot if I overclocked it, I dropped a Cooler Master TX3 w/dual fans and Gelid GC Xtreme thermal compound on it...running full bore in PS2, it never goes above 32C overclocked to 4.2Ghz...its a really nice APU!
B002APU580|5.0|This is my favorite remake of this movie!! I could watch this over and over and never get tired from this show.
0807014273|4.0|I thought Frankl's approach on psychoanalysis and logotherapy was very interesting, especially with all of the exemplifications he implements in order to illustrate his points. I've read various testimonies of the Holocaust, some of which include Night, I am David, Summer of my German Soldier, Diary of Anne Frank, Number the Stars, The Boy in Striped Pajamas, One day in the life of Ivan Denisovich, amongst others, and I think what makes Frankl's account of World War two so powerful is his dissection of the behaviors he observed, and ultimately, the reasoning behind them. But beyond attempting to inspire sympathy or pity on the reader's side, I think the fact that his explanations of humans' search for meaning, etc, still applies to our society today is a fundamental element to his success as an author. His seamless writing combines a narrative of his experience in camp life with a deep level of understanding and erudition in terms of psychology that leaves the reader with a thorough picture of the Holocaust, its aftermath, and the effects on the human mind.
1400079144|3.0|I read one other book of Brown's and I thought this would be similar but I couldn't wade thru the detail easily and probably wasn't interested enough to work at it.  It was like reading an article in Mother Jones. Too much detail that did not move the story along, just cluttered it up.  I need hard evidence to  accept/believe and this was just not reasonable enough for me. I finished it tho and will read another of Brown's books. One more and then decide how I rate his talent.
B006LSZECO|5.0|There have been some negative reviews about the ending of this novel because it was an unusual ending. Personally i could not put my kindle down for 5 nights straight plowing the story of the sociopath, Amy, and the intricacies of her marriage. It was an atrocious case of abuse, yet so hard to look away. Great writing and great read.
0446580848|5.0|DeMille is my favorite author for the last several years so I read anything and everything he writes. Love his characters sarcasm/wit (much like the author's own) but....I believe he's turning these John Corey books out too fast. He's good but his early books, especially Up Country and Cathedral were incredible and his best work. I wish he'd put Corey aside and start again.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Slow moving but includes beautiful music.  Be sure to stay with it for the after credits....very.  Always like anything with Maggie Smith.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|There is a version that works fine on my phone (HTC My Touch 4G Slide) and on my Nexus 7 tablet available in the Play store, but the version here on Amazon claim to not be compatible with my devices. I'm just aggravated that half the games that work on my devices that I can get elsewhere are listed on Amazon as games that will not work with my devices and thus have no way to install from the Amazon store but there may be a better price on Amazon. If I'm willing to take the risk of spending money on something that doesn't work on my tablet/phone - great. Warn me - several times if you must - that it may not work, but at least let me try to install it instead of not offering it on the list of apps I own.<br /><br />This is a really fun game to pick up off and on when I have a few minutes. While I prefer the original PC game that had longer courses and snarkier voicing, this is still a fun \\"sequel\\" and I'm glad it is available on Android. I just had to go elsewhere to actually load it - if I have to eventually pay for it when the \\"try it FREE\\" week is up, I will be considerably more irritated as I prefer to have all my paid apps on one vendor and I prefer to have them all together here but it doesn't do a lick of good if I can't actually install what I buy here because of an arbitrary limitation that claims this version will not work on my devices.
B003TTMFCK|5.0|It is a great series.  I don't know why I missed each and every episode in regular broadcast, but I did.  I was looking for a critical acclaimed series and I decided to give Grey's a try.  Very impressed...not to soap operate like but good charicter driven with medical interest.  I like it and am hooked...and ps I have never experienced such a long and packed with so many episodes.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Good entertainment for my 9 year old on a rainy summer afternoon.  We liked it and would recomend to others. NO profanity but a little gruesome.  Great for boys!
B00A8LYYI0|5.0|Greatly done. Way better then that POS they call silent hill one. I recommend this one then the 2006 Silent Hill movie.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book kept me captivated and reading late into the night.  An ending one would never be able to guess.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I ENJOY PLAYING ANGRY BIRDS VERY MUCH. IT IS A FUN GAME TO PLAY. EASY TO LEARN AND A LITTLE ADDICTIVE, AND CHALLENGING.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome!You collect coins while your trying to run away from the security guard!This game travels all around the world ,so it looks like your at the place!I recommend this game to everyone. -THE GAME RATER
B000I9VZJ8|3.0|This movie was recommended by my 30-something children as being hilarious.  Being a 70-something parent I think we hit the ol' generation gap.  I guess it comes down to what you like.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|It is an interesting mixture of classic vocal reminiscent of jazz and modern lyrics and sound. It really surprised me - a unique new sound.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|I already had this for iPhone and was interested to see if it was the same for Kindle. To my surprise it was pretty different, well worth the repurchase. MORE GREAT APPS FOR KINDLE PLEASE.
B004EF65QA|4.0|This is a show you watch when you need to get away from everything. The story I could have written, it very simple, need no brains to work it out, characters never move on to from the start to finish like watching paint dry but I needed this the day I watched it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I loved this book from the very beginning. It kept me wrapped in its storyline from start to finish!! Highly recommend.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|This movie was extremely entertaining! The blood was a bit much and a bit fake but the laughs were real!
0440423228|5.0|This book (and the first one) is a great gift for fantasy fans!  My elderly husband and his adolescent grandson both loved it.  My husband has embraced graphic novels because of their ties to the comic books of his youth, if you have not considered a graphic novel for an older man, try it.  And, this is a great series, these books are &#34;keepers&#34;.
B005BE79YA|1.0|did not like it at all. certainly not at all worth the time and money spent on it. yuck! yuck
B0091REZMW|3.0|As long as it loads properly it is very cool to play. It does freeze sometimes I had to uninstall and reinstall it just to play. Which took me back to level one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is so cool. It has all these cool features like;lava ,skeletons ,zombies,and even creepers(things that blow up like TNT!). It's just so cool I have a survival & a creative game right there.:)
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I liked it we watched for movie night at the house. I was happy with it hut have seen better. Streisand was wonderful as usual I think it was more me remembering her in a non mother role
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The Language of Flowers captured my attention with the first sentence. Not only was the book a good novel but it was instructive to one not a gardener. Looking at flowers now reminds me of the book and a delightful summer read.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|You get little advertisements that you have to close but it is programmable and very useful. I really like it.
B005P4P966|5.0|I just became a  Big Bang Theory  fan! I've had to catch up on the seasons I've missed & I  am enjoying every episode. The video quality is fantastic. I enjoy watching BBT past episodes more than the Summer TV trash on now!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a fun game, but I haven't had much time to play with it so I never finished it. It's worth having.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Great show and quality. The first two seasons are available. Should offer season three on prime though. I was impressed by the show.
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|The story lacked any substance at all. Fun characters and a fun setting, but the plot had nowhere to go and nothing to do.
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|Says it's free but it's really not. Every game I tried to play had to be bought. That's not free.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Although I read it trough, I was not involved by the story. Another &#34;end of the world plot&#34; in which something is lacking to spark my interest.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I needed a good printer app for a tablet. Their were many good ones for sale. I had an HP printer and this was a free HP app so I just gave it a try and I'm glad I did. Work wonderfully.
B002APU580|5.0|Love this movie. I received this DVD in short order and have watch it a number of times already.  I love period pieces.
B00498XRPE|5.0|Although the effects and picture quality were lower than newer movies.  I enjoyed watching the film and highly recommend others watch it.<br />I particularly liked the fact that there is clean continuity between Prometheus and Alien with several key components.
B0081336FO|5.0|Loved this series. Even though you are familiar with the stories they make it exciting and suspenseful. Definitely a good watch
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I love all of Cornwell's Scarpetta series books. All of them have their own merits. I do not agree with the many naysayers who were used to her earlier safe and predictable style. Any dedicated reader of series writers knows that they go through many different stages of growth and the reader must keep an open mind and develop with the writer. Otherwise stick with single books. It's safer. Or keep an open mind and see where the journey takes you.
B0083Z614S|4.0|Very good and interesting peaking interested page I  turn and the descriptions of Scenery are vivid giving the reader more clarity.
B008602KQI|3.0|After reading all of the books, I gave the movie a try.  It was ok.  It basically followed the book with things missing because movies can never have all of the detail of the books.  I think it would have been better if it was rated R or something like that.  For me, it was a little watered down, but like I said, still ok
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Great story, very well written, takes you inside the life of a quadrapalegic and how they are forced to cope.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Couldn't put it down. Would love to know what kind of bouquet Victoria would create for me.  I highly recommend
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|Hits a bump at two miles an hour.  Flips over and breaks neck.<br />Hits a bump at one mile an hour.  Flips over and breaks neck.<br /><br />This is the QWOP of android racing games.  Terrible physics; terrible game.  Even for free it is not worth it.
B007VTUYWW|3.0|One of the better video game to movie adaptations. Angelina Jolie was a perfect fit for the title character. If you've never seen it before or haven't seen it in a while, it's definitely time to.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|The only reason I can give this movie 1 star, rather than zero, is due to the fact that we turned it off after about 20 mins.
B00B935SUY|5.0|If you love great music and watching the creative process that goes into recording sessions. If you appreciate the human sound of music, then you will enjoy this movie/documentary. Loaded with musicians crossing several genres, all telling stories of how they came to be at Sound City, and the heart of the studio, the Neve board. Dave Grohl tells a love story about the studio that launched his career.
B00CATSONE|5.0|The research and the way the wrighter brought forth the history of not only what this genius had achieved but also his mistakes. This shows that to do one perfect achievement there may be a few bungles.
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|Would recommend it to anyone.  Great action film. Shared it with others, who loved it also. Will more than likely be watching it again.
0671449028|5.0|This is a favorite book at our house. Both of my kids love it! Bought this copy for a baby shower gift.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|it is a fun little game to play when you want to chill for a bit!!!  I like to play waiting for appointments. and stuff.
B002LU0E26|3.0|While this movie is a good attempt at a Superman story, and the lead actor was a good tribute to Chris Reeve, the story falls apart in the last act, and looses its way. To have Superman beaten as he is was a bad move, and to let Lex L get off so lightly in the end was just poor writing. It could have been so much better.
0385349947|5.0|As a twenty-something female with a business undergrad degree, I picked this up hoping for some clarity in the path I'm on. Sheryl Sandberg did that and more for me with this book. She made me more confident in my decision to pursue business in a male-dominated industry and more confident in myself as a woman. I agree with Sheryl in that I have never particularly liked the term feminist for fear of sounding too independent. But women and men alike need to be feminists in this day and age to achieve gender equality. It's time for all of us to lean in!
B004GJVI5C|5.0|I have really enjoyed Ben Affleck's movies. I wasn't a huge fan when he was new but after the last couple I have seen he has really shined.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great cast, wonderful storyline, love the fashions,glad not to be living at that time.To be responsible for so many lives and juggle all that responsibility is awesome.
B006RXQ0JO|5.0|This movie was great on so many levels. There is a part of the movie where you will be completely torn but that to me is what made it great. If you haven't seen this movie WATCH IT NOW!!!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|The last books in this series were thought out and the story was interesting. This book had a quick choppy and basically uninteresting storyline.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think that this is a nice game because it is cool I guess and you get to buy a tank
B007MNV5WU|5.0|You can't go wrong with Angry Birds!  It still hooks you and gives you hours of entertainment.  Can't wait for another one.
B009MYARIK|4.0|Always a fan of Sophie Kinsella, this novel was a quick, fun read. Don't purchase it expecting a life-altering, inspiring, or challenging read - it's a quick, fun, chick-lit weekend read.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Fun and simple game.  It hooks you and challenges you, even though it seems to be a very simple game!
B00CUWKHVI|5.0|Great album.  Pure Imagination is inspirational.  Love Jamie's voice and style.  The flow and mix on this album is magical.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Excellent writer. I have read all three books. This one did not disappoint. Can't wait for his next one. I could hardly put it down from beginning to end it kept my full attention. Not and easy task with so many writers available on amazon.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I hope they update with more floors soon. Can't wait for my son to discover this app waiting for him on the kindle!
B001EBYMB2|5.0|Excellent film, but not for those who are upset by violence and bloody scenes.  There is a surreal feeling at times.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loving this game,it's challenging and fun! I enjoy the fact that it's not soo difficult you want to give up! The balance is just right and it makes you feel clever!
B006AZZPCM|2.0|I would've given this a five star if there wasn't porn ads spamming the heck out of my screen. Plus, it crashes sometimes. Also, it takes forever to download videos. Overall, i give this app a 2 star.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I think that Dexter is very entertaining. I hope that it has another season, although it looked like the last one. Too bad.
B00280LYIM|5.0|The plot was interesting as always with unexpected twists.  I just love this series.  I also liked how the characters continue to grow and mature.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a beautifully written and spellbinding story that crosses generations. You will love every character in this book. You will think about how it might end as you turn pages one after another to get to the conclusion. This is a sobering story but the moments of joy are illuminating.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I love how this series combines classic Greek mythology and the modern world.  The characters are interesting and the plot is intriguing.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|do not get this app it dosent let you download some music i had 200 songs in an album and got earsed
B004XISI4A|5.0|Always surprised by the turns this series takes. Expect the unexpected. Prepare for one hell of a ride. two words required.
0896762629|5.0|I was eagerly awaiting the publication of this book, delayed by the death of the author. I have the other 3 books in the series. The detailed analysis of each garment is very valuable to costumers trying to reproduce fashions of the times. A very good reference work to have on the shelf.
1416550550|5.0|I really liked this book. It was well written and I enjoyed the story, though at times, it made me uncomfortable in its description of poverty, both of the physical and the mental kind.
B007KDFWRG|2.0|Same songs as Revelator just more instrumental.  If I had known I would not have purchased because I already have Revelator.
1932100660|5.0|food and nutrition is one of the most important aspect in people,lives, this book has said it all  thank u
B00004YA66|5.0|In todays more than cynical times, a movie of this sort is nothing less than refreshing. It is gripping, touching, thorough, and interesting. I mean, at times, you literally cheer the film! That is an impressive thing to have happen. Its good to watch by yourself, with your partner, or with your family. I love this movie so much.
B003OFVIXG|3.0|New, Simple, Good musicians, nice voice, interesting lyrics!!!<br />A beautiful example of the new France!!<br />Sometimes the rhythms of the backing track a little too much alike.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|there are so many things to do on this app this is the only drawing app I like. I love how you can make your own meme
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Never read a book like. It's original and only gets better. I recommend this book to all teenagers and adults.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love playing this game.  I haven't had any problems.  Love the colors.  They are brilliant and sharp.  I finished the trial version and was wanting more so I bought the full version.
B0097C8XL0|2.0|This app is just like temple run except it's  a penguin whoever made this app is just copying off of it
B00AH8FTT2|4.0|Archer follows his tales with twists, turns and double backs. This story isn't different. It's an easy fast read. Very enjoyable.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|Kids love and easy to play.  Just like dress up.  They get to choose hair, make-up and clothing for each girl
B0042TV4IW|4.0|i have always loved shows like this . The period pieces or shows are some of my favorite type . I find that i am into more & more bbc & pbs movies and series
B00CKKG0JS|5.0|This has been a fantastic series. I'm looking forward to season 8. I know the season starts tonight on Showtime. Does anyone know when it will be available on Amazon Instant Video?
B003XVYLDU|1.0|This book was not what i expected.i always heard what a great book this was.one of the best of all time. I found it a very booring and had to force myself to finish it. So it goes.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonderful book and I look forward to the next one.  Great drama and interesting look into the thoughts and real life experiences of a world with this kind of experience.
1401324649|3.0|This book has all the right ingredients to be a very good read.  The idea of an elderly man escaping from his assisted living home is great.  However, the ha-ha's stopped when the story suddenly became totally unbelievable.
B0059DQDR2|5.0|This is a movie about love and loss, life and death, and yes, it is also a movie about Paris.  Cedric Klapisch has become one of my favorite directors as I also thoroughly enjoyed l'Auberge espagnole and lex Poupees Russes.
0307341550|2.0|Better, but very difficult to read.  The twists and turns kept me coming back, but I would not recommend it to anyone.
B005SHTXN0|5.0|Anyone who watches this film falls in love with the characters in this film.  It was one of my late father's favorite movies, and I now<br />imitate Raymond's peculiarities the way he did.  It's also a movie about driving across America which has a romance all its' own.
0307341577|1.0|Got this book because GONE GIRL was getting such good reviews.  I read a lot of mysteries & thrillers, but this one was way too violent and descriptive for me!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I'm never too successful with throwing birds and get stuck after only a few levels. But it is easy to play on the tablet.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This was a good book but not one of the best of the crossfire books. The ending was a disappointment, she set it up for the next book but she could have given us a little bit more story.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|As one who has never been coaught up in the &#34;soaps&#34; I was surprised by my addiction to this story. It captavated me but my husband could take it or leave it and finally did not watch it with me.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|The book was good. An easy read that kept me interested. It was similar to his other books, but I've come to expect a certain amount of predictability from his book
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Every time I try to log on, I get the message that there was an error in processing my request. My log in information is correct. But an error occurs every time!
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Had not seen this show in years. I had forgotten just how good it was! Wish there had been more seasons. It was cancelled too soon.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I think this may be the best of the Robert Langdon series.  Very fast pace and I love the setting of Washington DC.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The Good Wife continues to be a wonderful show.  The writing is excellent, the acting is believable, and the guest stars are great.  This is truly a show for those who appreciate a mature story with strong characters.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great wonderful excellent bitch-in book!  i would recommend this to any and all who love the Game of Thrones series.  So much detail.  can't put it down!
B000002UZ6|5.0|This is one of Tina's best CD's.  I purchased this to replace one I had scratched.  It's older but still great.  If you like Tina you should have this one.
B0070Z4LLW|5.0|thought it'd be a letdown from the original, but this film is one mean mutha. horror, suspense, gore, it's got it all. great fx.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|First rpg game I have played on Kindle. its fun so far wish it didn't take so much memory. Then again the game play wouldn't be as good.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|This was an excellent novel.  It is a very quick read (I finished the book in about two days) so be prepared: once you pick it up you won't want to let go.
B003Z49LYO|5.0|I loved the acting and casting.  Also, the cinematography and scene landscapes were particularly great. This story is a turbulent sad one, but it also is one of timeless human nature and learning and love.
B00CKJ2KK2|1.0|I downloaded this app and it said &#34;You don't have enough storage to play&#34;, so i deleted the most useless apps I had but I still didn't<br />have enough space. The video looked amazing but i don't want to delete important apps.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|Not user friendly.  Don't understand the concept.  Don't like the game.  wouldn't recommend the game.  Would remove if knew how.
6305428042|5.0|I recall watching this movie when I was younger and just loved it now I got to share it with my children and they also fell in love!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game, challenging but not impossible. Clever new game, try it you will like it.  Keeps the mind working enjoyable, keep it up software makers
B00005NB8K|5.0|It keeps you hooked it's one of those movies that is a must see I love it!! It just gives you a window into the word of the doors its full of sex, drugs and rock and roll!!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Love this game, very fun and if you love bejeweled you will love this game. Challenge your friends and see who's best!
B008133MDK|5.0|I have watched all six of  this series (Season 1 and 2) several times.  I think it is brilliant how the writers have taken the classic Arthur Conan Doyle classics and made them current without losing their original cleverness.  The actors are perfectly suited to their characters.  There couldn't have been better choices made.  I love these and I am anxiously waiting for the new season.  Grab the popcorn and enjoy.  Perfect for &#34;binge viewing&#34;
B00AFEXRME|5.0|this is one of Denzel,s best. everything he does is great.  love him as an actor.  always want to see more of his movies.
159562015X|5.0|Books and package were ok. As expected. Thanks a lot. 100% recommended. I was planning a department session, and the books arrived perfect & on time
B00000F566|5.0|The DVD got here quickly was well packed. Thank you so much much this manufacturer place to shop and will continue to shop more and more lol
B00C2VIA52|5.0|great i really like this game its a blast and i soo reqomend it really fun and addicktive fo sho
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is a great way to learn strategy. This game is the number one building game. Thank you very much
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Having a great time playing on my kindle fire. Graphics are great, even though don't understand lack luster shine on Mark IV . Speed of flight seems to get faster and faster till you crash. Do people actually travel further than 20000, or will I get that much better. You want a game to be challenging..
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a highly challenging game. With plenty of ways of putting your mind to the test...this is a fantastic game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I had such a great time figuring out how to escape each room.<br />Anyone who enjoys a good puzzle would enjoy this.
B00884GR0W|5.0|The game itself is great! It's like Minecraft and Skyrim combined! The graphics are... well... they are alright but other than the graphics the game is really cool. All of the time I've had a Kindle Fire I've always wanted to see if there was something just like this. Nothing came close! Get this game if you want to save a lot of money!
B00CL66FEQ|4.0|I have enjoyed Seth Rogen in past movies, but lately, he hasn't been rocking my world with hilarity as much. On the otherhand, I am not usually a Streisand fan, but she's been a real delight n the Fockers franchise. All in all, I wasn't sure what to expect when we ordered this rental, but I am really glad we did. They both do a great job in the film, though there is a funny interchange between them and their shenanigans are funny as well, the focus is the relationship between the mother and her grown up son. That story is really warm and endearing, and made me think about calling my mother several times. It is a great flick to watch with your hubby and we thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book is great if you enjoy a good mystery or suspense novel. It held my attention from beginning to end.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is no ordinary love story or mystery.  The characters are smart, scary, and deceiving.  I raced thru it to find what would happen next.  The ending is not easy to predict and quite scary to believe from my perspective.  Is it love or captivity?
B00COHIFQS|4.0|Being a horror genre fan, I definitely had to check this out. I like the director's style and enjoyed the visuals thorughout the film. If you're a horror fan, don't miss this one because the scares had me pleasantly surprised.
B009GRMH7C|5.0|gotta love Milla, she is beautiful, intense and the Sigourney Weaver from Alien in the RE series. The girl of a lot of guys, and girls, dreams.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was eagerly waiting for this book..Gideon and Eva's story was so consuming. I didn't like the changing release dates but maintained my anticipation for resolving their relationship. This book really felt like filler for the next book. It was so lacking in substance..the back stories being built just seemed to be attempts at deflecting attention from the main story without any reason other than to add word count.<br /><br />Not sure I will purchase the next book. I had been an avid fan prior. I didn't return the book, but I did seriously consider it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The story of Eva and Gideon is naughty and loving. I am in love with the characters and can't get enough. Patiently waiting for the next book.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|My wife and I have loved the show from the first season on.  Its a sick show, but you have to love it!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|As a Tina Fey fan, I enjoyed her story. Although it dragged in a few places, it was funny and provided an insight into the psyche of a very talented woman.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|works well,well organized.quite easy to setup with akk the alternatives and most important of all the interface looks really great
B009NY43NY|5.0|I put off reading this book because of the bad reviews. I was wrong.  It was time for this series to end . I  have been reading from the beginning and didn't let &#34;True Blood&#34; screw me up.  I enjoyed this ending and going back to the first book I alway saw her ending with Sam, not a vampire !  I thought it was a good end for Eric, so he didn't get &#34;true love&#34; he got everything else he wanted ! And in the end Eric came first for Eric. I now feel like Sookie will have a life she wants. Marriage and children and sunshine . For CH don't let the bitching get you down its a good book!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This series is very similar to another series but it has a better story line. Easy read and enjoyable. Hoping she finishes the 4th book soon.
B004LROUNG|2.0|i came back to Grisham after several years and I could not be more disappointed.  Did not think this book was catching, interesting or 'funny'.  I do not read Grisham for humor and I could not turn pages fast enough out of boredom.  Just nott he legal drama I would expect from this author. BORING.
B00CXX8KTA|4.0|The band have been touring and playing bad Thin Lizzy for a while ( could argue about tribute band, as they have some original members)<br /><br />This has a modern feel and production, and listening with eyes closed, it could be TL, but not as good as with Phil Lynott. But a good heavy rock album with strong Lizzy influences.
B006OOHYIC|3.0|I enjoy playing this. But it gets very difficult to solve the more you progress.  It defenitely get your brain working.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|This game is actually a lot of fun and looks very pretty.  However, I don't want to go broke playing it.  The game wanted me to buy something at every turn.  I would, however, be willing to pay for it up front.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|Love the show!!<br />Great storyline and great acting.<br />Characters are well defined.<br />Great cliff hangers.<br />Awesome actors and cast.<br />Hope show goes on a few more years.
B005I4JG80|4.0|This book was a fun read for me. I enjoyed learning about child rearing in another culture (I had no idea it could be so different!) and I look forward to Americanizing the pieces that appeal to me. I call the book 'polite' because unlike some other parenting books the author never made me feel inferior and acknowledged that its easier to do things the French way in France. It also helped me calm down about selecting a certain parenting style... Something I'd been beating myself up over. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because there was no summary of key points which I would have found helpful.
B0068THAGY|4.0|The kids are the heroes in this &#34;something is out to get us&#34; movie.  Suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I liked the back and forth with finding clues and objects for numbers, colors, and shapes. This made it challenging and rewarding.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|As I love Dr Who I dearly miss torchwood! Ill keel my fingers crossed for another awesome spin off or return of torchwood!
B001XUPH9K|4.0|Great Classic and the best of the original Star Trek Movies. Only a few slow spots but mostly action. Great
B009G3MSC0|5.0|Thoughly enjoyed this book, learnt some new life skills and entertained throughout.<br /><br />If you choose to, you will get so much from this biography.<br /><br />Thank you Arnold
B00A861QMM|2.0|If there weren't so many nice little mini-games, I would have hated this game.  I'm not a huge fan of HO, and the HO's here are close to  impossible.  The hint button recharges quickly; you'll need it.  Music ok, graphics not great.  There is quite the plotline.  Yes, the text of the dialog doesn't match exactly, but it's different as in gift/present or trip/journey, or just the rearranging of sentence parts.  The spoken dialog (I should say narration) is nicely done, although she spoke slower than I read, so I just read the text and skipped ahead.  The narration goes on and on.  Not badly written, just more like a short story than a game!<br />Played ok on my Kindle Fire 2nd gen.  Would only recommend if you're desperate for a fresh adventure/HO game.  I know I'm not the only Kindle owner who's waiting for some new games to be released.
B00DF0POXA|4.0|Kanye changes it up once again. This album has emotion it. It has a real feel mixed with some new sounds.<br />A must hear for all kanye fans.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Yes this is a good book.  I liked it all the way through.  The character sketches are marvelous and the plot leads you in a merry chase of whodunit to the end.  There is a TV serial with the same characters and it is alright but doesn't hold a candle to this book.  I will read more of this series of books, if they are even half as good they will be worth it.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|The Good Wife is such a good series.  It is well written and has a great cast.  The twist in each episode keeps one interested to the end.  I haven't watched the series on network tv but I'm not sure the impact of the story would be the same with the commercial interruptions.
B0059WTMLW|1.0|Malware aside, it took my two minutes to get three puzzles that were unbeatable because the devs don't understand how Sudoku puzzles are played. I didn't even look at the other game modes because I read the reviews about Open Feint, as if this app weren't bad enough.
1595828095|5.0|Excellent Artwork, Bernie never ceases to amaze. I swear it's the best brush line I've ever seen. I'll be sure to buy more of his work, and this book made a lifelong fan out of me.
B001NLKZUA|3.0|There were some parts that were harder to get into than others, but overall it was cool. I just wish that a few more things were revealed in this book.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I love the depth of this series. I love how he keeps you guessing. Just when you think you have a handle on the plot and who the heroes are your world is turned upside down. I cant wait for him to finish the series.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|Love this movie quality is great streaming is so much easy can watch anywhere I have Internet with no problem
B000063UR1|2.0|not a good movie at all with bad props and bad actors as well not for me or any of my family!
B000XUBC5E|4.0|hard to put down  very entertaining- some times had to stop and sort out the story line  keeps you on the edge of your seat right up until the last page
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|This was a great movie, and I love that the digital copy is released before the dvd date. Usually I feel that most movies do not do their books justice, however this one really did a good job!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I thought the game might stupid but I am having a good time playing. I would like better sound effects but I am ok with what they have.
B0044KU7EQ|5.0|I absolutely love this collection. Inside, the box is divided into four parts. The 52 CDs are arranged in three of them, and there's a small harmonica in the fourth.
B000YAA68C|4.0|This is a really good movie....not great but very good. The story is very moving....romantic.....funny. I would recommend it to anyone who likes chick flicks. I had no problem with the seller the DVD arrived in good shape and on time.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I really enjoyed the story line it is so good. The character were well developed. I can only say, you should see this movie!!
B009K0OL06|5.0|It is my favorite &#34;guilty pleasure&#34; Greatest show since Knot's Landing. Nolan is the best. Love the fact that it is supposed to be in New York.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele never disappoints.  What a voice...love the music.  Buy this one and you will enjoy the music for hours. Recommend.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I can not emphasize this enough: this is one of the best books I've ever read on how to support children and learn to get to the root of their problems when motivation is slipping away or already lost. I began to read it just as I was introduced to a student who fit this book's profile perfectly. The book quickly became an invaluable resource as I struggled to figure out the pathology of this child's problem and how to begin addressing it. The book also made me look at my own parenting habits and history in order to continue working on being the best parent I can to my own 3 children. GET THIS BOOK! You won't be able to put it down and you'll say it's one of the best purchases you've made this year! 3 thumbs up  :)
B00144VBBS|5.0|What can i say?  35 Biggest Hits is simply the best.  I have listened to the 2 set CD's for hours when traveling and it makes the time fly by.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This app is awesome, but addicting. I can't stop playing it! The only thing I would change would be to add more customers or people to the game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely adore English history.  I was up way after midnight rewatching episodes I had already seen.  Downtown Abby gets better every time I see it!!  Keep them coming...PLEASE!
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|I bought this to use with a GoPro Hero 2 camera because it had been recommended by other GoPro users.  When I tested this mic out I found that it performed very well when the mic was within a few inches of my mouth, but the performance dropped off dramatically as the distance grew, and was nearly inaudible at only about 18\\" away.  The sound quality of this mic is fantastic, but the limitations of mic placement make it significantly less useful than the terrible sounding but louder GoPro mic.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Totally addicted to the 'Crossfire' novels. Love the characters, plot and love story. Sylvia Day has done it again! Could not put it down. Team Gidian!
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|The only gripe about this deal is the UltraViolet digital copy. It's not really practical. The fact that it's a cloud based copy of the movie that requires internet to access it is a problem. I'd rather have a true digital copy that I can link in to my itunes account via a voucher or something. But to fix the problem, you could just torrent a copy for yourself to have as a digital copy. :/ If you want to, of course.<br /><br />But anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the american remake. Not bad at all.
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|This book is a winner on the action packed front! From the start your on an adventue into the world of vampires, shadow hunters, demons, faeries and warlocks. It's a great read for us mundanes.
0061438294|5.0|we borrowed from public library, then order a copy of our own after it is returned. I feel a bit smarter on decoding people's behavior for only a bit I can remember. I have to re-read the book a few more times.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this app it is absolutely adorable it is great for little girls but also big girls too it is a great game!!
B008BU75IQ|3.0|It took a while to get into this one, and it seemed a little more predictable - particularly the end - it's obvious the series is going to continue....
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|Horrible acting even for a horror movie. Very predictable and filmed too dark couldn't really see anything. Idea and plot had a lot of<br />potential , but quickly faded. Would only watch in a pinch.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|This movie was simply awesome. I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to watch a good fairy tale movie. Not to mention if you're a fan of Jack the Giant Slayer.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I've read nearly all the books Nelson DeMille has written and Plum Island twice.  This most recent order was a gift for my sister so she could read Plum Island digitally on her Kindle.  Since this story takes place on Long Island, the Hamptons, North Fork and South Fork, we felt compelled to visit the area, and so we will be travelling there in August.  The author, DeMille lives on Long Island also and his earlier book, The Gold Coast, is set there.  His character descriptions and development are so well written that they just leap off the page and become embedded in the reader's mind. I recommend Plum Island to those readers who love mystery, suspense and murder, in a sophisticated way, i.e., no huge bloody scenes.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|When the move received recognitiong at the academy awards I decided to read the book. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much but found it very likeable.
B0097C8XL0|3.0|This game is super cute and I enjoyed it.....BUT.......when the game wasn't even running I would get a screen that said super penguins has stopped. This of course annoyed me and I deleted it from my kindle.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|Works as advertised!<br />Stuff some crumpled paper in the bottom, load the charcoal into the chimney and light.<br />15-20 minutes later you dump into the grill.<br />I use lump charcoal, and a small weber table top grill which we camp with.<br />Sure beats the awful taste of using lighter fluid.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was amazing and very addictive. I have never read a book like it. Its a perfect combination between love and suspense with a lot of twist.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This was the  book I've ever read. Kept my attention all the way to the end. A real page turner!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|now this is a fun free game...do not have to be an artist to play this game...come on its hard to draw with a finger!  but that is the fun of it....can really laugh at yourself...get it!
B00004R95G|5.0|Saw this as a live stage performance and wanted to replace my dated video with the updated DVD for I intend to enjoy it for many years to come...
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|highley  recommend  this movie  ....a wonderful story....would watch it again...you will not be disappointed..  So go ahead and rent it...
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this app, use it all the time, weather forecasts are detailed enough to help me plan my outside activities.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I thought, when downloading it, it was probably going to be one of those really lame apps, but I was wrong. I love the fact that the little dragon habitats give you dragon cash. I also love that when I bought all the main types of dragons, I could breed them and get dragons for FREE!!! I was really excited when I discovered that. There is a down side to the breeding. Sometimes, the breeding takes a long time. I have had dragons that have bred for almost 12 hours. Also, the time it takes the eggs to hatch, is long. Some of the dragons take MORE than 12 hours to hatch. Anyways, I love that I can visit a random player's place. I have been to places where they have more than 1 island and almost all of the types of dragons. This game is, LITERALLY, tons of fun and very addictive.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I did not love it, and not really sure why. It is tragic, with glimmers of hope.  I just might have been in more of a mood for a read with a bit more happiness.  Very well written and enjoyable read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best never-ending running games I have ever played, it doesn't just have basic characters, it has a new character with every update. It is a 5 star game! :)
B001SZ2Y4G|4.0|If you like the Cohen brothers movies, I think you will enjoy this movie. It also has the added benefit of having the late Paul Newman cast as a stereotyped big business villain. This was an aspect of the movie I found very interesting.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Not going to lie, I  almost didn't finish it. I was ready to put it back on the shelf and maybe not ever pick it up again. But I powered through and I am so glad I did! At first I found the characters boring and lifeless. I was bored. When I got to part 2, it was all making sense.<br />In the end, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game only has ten levels. I wish there were more. It Only takes a<br />half hour to complete game.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|I loved it, but brandon sanderson is still not Robert Jordan. He did a great job continuing the story and finishing it off. He even captured the characters wonderfully. But he is still not Jordan. So I can't out of respect to Mr. Jordan give Mr. Sanderson a full five. Sorry Mr. Sanderson, but u now have a new reader.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I have been looking for books on how to learn faster and this is an excelent book to read. The principles and finding that Tim Ferriss presents are simple but also deep. Excelent book.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Gets the download done - after you figure out how. Could be simpler, but it works.<br />Just a bit clunky. I imagine it will get better. In the meantime, if you want to save a YouTube video on your iPad or iPhone, this is it.
B0063IH60K|1.0|MobilityWare's Spider solitaire app is such a great game, I don't know why they even market this one. The graphics look like an old DOS game. Skip this, get MW's Spider Solitaire.
B00338QENI|5.0|PS.....I submitted the wrong review.  The one I sent for &#34;finding Henrietta Lacks&#34;  should be for  The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks
B00881VLCE|5.0|Tons of free puzzles as well as beautiful sets of puzzles you can buy, if you want them. You get 30 free puzzles every month! Puzzles are beautiful and varied.<br />You can choose the number of pieces to work with (42 to 500), you can change the background color to make the shapes easier to see, you can select whether or not to have the program rotate the pieces and the puzzle. The 42 piece puzzles are perfect for young children, and the 500 piece puzzle with rotation is a real challenge. I prefer to play 288 pieces without rotation.<br />Best part of this app is the responsiveness of the developer. You have a problem? Email them. They'll get back to you within a few hours. They're very responsive to problems and suggestions. Refreshing!<br />If you like puzzles, you'll love this app.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Can wait for the next one! Soo much better than 50 shades, if that is possible... Want to read them all again after I finished this one!
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Bruce Willis phones it in, his generic tough guy son is an even less talented Channing Tatum knock- off, and the whole thing has the quality of a video game cut scene. Avoid at all costs.
B00821OX98|5.0|Starts of a little slow, but I think it needs to start of slow in order to build in the characters, But it is a good show, interesting characters and good storyline
B0099114WO|5.0|A sensitive yet funny movie that provides a positive and hopeful message. Excellent portrayals by talented, veteran actors. Plenty of emotional tension during a last-ditch struggle to save a failing marriage, but the movie ends happily. Plenty of good food for thought for all married couples.
B000FCK65W|4.0|I really enjoyed this story.  It was well told by the main character.  Very interesting characters.  I cannot believe I never read this as a child.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Reminds me of the good old days. Close examination of the graphics reveals its recent roots. Runs on android-x86-4.0-RC2 on a IBM X60 tablet.
B00190N4E4|5.0|This movie is perfect, I can't think of a thing that could have been different to make it better.  The casting is terrific, scenery is spectacular and the depiction of Gandhi as a great leader and a human being is superb, it deserved to win all of the Oscars it did.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Really fun with all the different weapons and cars but they need to make the cops better and their cars faster
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved the book couldn't put it down. Read it in 3 days, loved it so much that I ordered another one of Jojo,s books \\"the last letter from your lover: a novel\\" and that is great too.
1451697686|5.0|This book has changed the way I think about my home. I'm now buying in bulk, streamlining my pantry, avoiding impulse purchases, and shopping in thrift stores.  I was already aware that I \\"should\\" be doing these things, but the way Bea talks about it in her book, she makes the point that these habits can make your life simpler, more meaningful, and aesthetically pleasing.  That is what hooked me.  I originally bought this book on Kindle, but now I'm buying a hard copy so I can give it to my friends.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I was very sad to learn, half way through the book, that the next book and some of the ragged ends, is still not even finished. I'll need a refresher course by the time the next book is published. This is a disservice to your readers, Mr Martin.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|A tour de force performance: almost as good as live. Bonus appearance of Sarah Brightman and 4 former phantoms. As good as it gets on DVD.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I made the mistake of purchasing thisonly to have Lookout flag it as Adware.  This is absolutely inexcusable in a paid app.
B002SHD9E2|2.0|Lush, lavish, the beauteous music. All the ingredients, but staged around Butler's inadequate singing. Questionable direction, especially in the lair and Point of No Return. This was a a complete, unsatisfactory letdown that made me return to the 35th anniversary DVD to take away the bad taste it left. Substitute Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess, and it would be far better.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Its just wonderful, marvellous, the language is so flowering. The story unique, sad, thrilling, breathtaking. PLS write a book each year mr Hosseini
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|A different take on a movie about Zombies.  Interesting from beginning to end.  I saw it with my grandson and then watched it with my wife--she loved it.
B0057LUI0O|5.0|Who would have known Rio could be so entertaining?! Tiny-sota, the teasing Canadian geese, the marmoset leader wearing a gold watch as a belt,... Bravo!
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|I can't wait for Season 2. Season 1 was excellent the chacters were exciting . Storey line kept my attention.
B00785P2QC|5.0|My kids absolutely love it. It keeps them very entertained on road trips and while waiting in a doctor's waiting room.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|No better movie made. This is an old friend and I never tire of watching it. I also enjoy exposing younger associates to this one, for some, it is the first B&W film they have ever seen.
B00B7FOQCK|4.0|I had been looking for a USB 3 port which was portable, economical and handy. This met all the parameters. Only challenge that I see if sometimes if you plug 03 or more devices, the devices tend to auto-eject. Happens off and on but does happen. Quite annoying when it happens while you are copying or moving something. Other than that, no complaints thus far. Happy to hear from anyone on how I can minimise/eliminate the auto eject error.<br />Cheers<br />R
B0040FTKNY|5.0|This show is incredibly engaging! Never felt bored. I really enjoyed it and am excited for the rest of the seasons / series!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great job on creating such a great and fun game. It really makes you think<br /> outside the box. Great work guys.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|Love this series, gives you a unique insight to that part of history!  I hate that it was only 4 seasons.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Everything about it is great! The actors, the story-lines, the plot and depth!! EVERYTHING! I am hooked and want to watch it all the time. I have even had to re-watch the series so my husband could see it from the beginning and it was awesome the second time around too, even though I knew what was coming!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great book. Great characters. I couldn't put it down. I am looking forward to the next book. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys action novels.
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|I Thought About You-a tribute to Chet Baker (CD) by Eliane Elias: This is indeed a tribute to Chet Baker and it simply works. I think the tribute is that all the cuts are outstanding tunes on their own and a tribute to Chet Baker's choices and are hallmarks to his career starting with his work for Pacific Jazz, and his colleagues, Russ Freeman and Gerry Mulligan. Here, Ms. Elias uses some pretty terrific sidemen including Randy Brecker, Marc Johnson, Steve Cardenas, Oscar Castro-Neves, Victor Lewis, Rafael Barata and Marivaldo Dos Santos.The arrangements are all Ms. Elias and the music simply carries you along smoothly, effortlessly and dynamically. This was a real treat for me and it will be for you as well. A Five Star cannot miss CD. I loved it!!
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I have never read the books but my kids and I are going to start this fall. The movie was wonderful. I love the mountains fighting.
B007WCJSWA|3.0|Wish he would do something freash and new- same stuff all the time- melody, lead, distorted lead, melody, distorted lean. Great musical line but execution is boring. Surprise me next time Mike!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Great movie but very long. I was hoping this would be good for my kids to watch, since we just finished studying Abe Lincoln. But the movie is aimed at adults with a lot of dialogue.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Rarely does a story continue to surprise, page after page. This one keeps us guessing, and the twists and turns do not seem contrived. I agree with other readers that it weakens a little at the end, but it remains true to its characters and plot. I couldn't put it down.
B002PE0HCU|5.0|My 8 and 10 year old wanted to watch a horror movie. I wanted to be careful in what I selected. They felt this movie was scarier then Iron Man and Lord of the Rings type movies. Still a classic. It was neat to watch it in color.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|The movie special effects are great. The story has action, non-sexual romance and humor, a good movie that shows a little humility goes along way.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game and my little brother of six loves this game. Its fun and challenging. He plays it and loves it too and he actually wins too. Fun app. Great for the whole family.
B004LPLU4K|5.0|This is a good family movie. A father learns that even though his wife passed away, he still has a son that needs him.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I loved these books! I bought them and I couldn't put them down and I read them all in a week! Must read!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A story about a terrible time in American history, of slavery and its cruelty. Yet it was of love, loyalty and devotion spanning a lifetime.
0307730700|5.0|it is just a great read, a book you just dont put down. i like the honesty about the bad and stupid things he did. it isn't all about war and the rambo junk. i wish i could get my son to read this. he too has a problem with crack cocaine. i heard eric blem on my christian radio station promote this book and i knew then i was buying it. there is nothing not to like about this book. i passed it on to my friends who are fighting there addiction.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its fun and awsome<br /><br />to find this app was amazing I truthfully play this all the time this game should win an award
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  The puzzles were able to  stump me but my nine year old daughter was able to figure things out that I couldn't.  The two of us together were able to solve them.  It was a nice way to work together,
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|It;s a very violent  movie but the acting is excellent and Scorese proves once again that he's a mastert of this genre.
B002CNOA6S|5.0|I've enjoyed this movie since the first time I watched it many years ago.  Great mix of tenderness, comedy, and genius.  Dustin Hoffman did a brilliant job in his role.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|turtleturtle chalenging turtles<br />rada radaa rada huhhhh huhhhhh rada raddaaaaaa<br />u can only read . if u speek snitzil<br />ra da rada radrr rada radduhhhhh
B008EKOIN8|5.0|If you are looking for a book that explains what cooking actually is and how it affects your food in mostly laymen's terms this book is for you. If you are looking for a cook book this is probably going to be a disappointment.<br /><br />A few years ago I read &#34;The Omnivore's Dilemma&#34; By Michael Pollen and loved it. I have since read some of his other work and enjoyed it but always felt that the rest of his work was just ok. So I approached this book with kind of mediocre expectations but buried deep high hopes. I was not disappointed. Much like &#34;The Omnivore's Dilemma&#34;, &#34;Cooked&#34; is a fun ride through Michael's own life and experiences with cooking.<br /><br />Michael manages to combine a personal story with a bit of history, philosophy, basic science and a touch of mysticism. Personally, I could do without the mystic parts but the rest is great.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|room opened...grate magged. table with vase mag. etc etc.  that's it... where was the key??  either bug or lame pedagogy ...either way...uninstalled
B005OT2YVA|1.0|…and less entertaining than an episode of the original cartoon show. But it provided background while painting dogs and rocks and stuff on a door…
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|Loved this, cant wait for the next. The evolution of characters & relationships so well written. Bring on the arrows stories.
B009NY43NY|5.0|This was a fantastic decision!  I would buy it again!  I loved it!  Definitely recommended to others to make life more simple!
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is a great series. I can't wait for season 4. After watching season 3, I found the comics online and started reading reading them.
B0018RC7QE|1.0|As the title said.  Not perverted enough to make it unrealistic.  Rather it applauds two people leaving their spouses and one his children, just because they felt like it.  Plus, it's just boring.  Had to fast forward.
B0007KS7D0|5.0|While ideal for most point-n-shoots, this clip-on lens is mind-blowing with a dSLR IF (and it's a BIG *IF*) your lens will be able to \\"see through\\" the 43mm glass elements of the Raynox.  That's right - the actual thread size of the glass element holder is only 43mm.  I'm sure that's part of what makes it affordable for the average photographer!  However, to make that work with my dSLR it means NOT using a wide-angle lens, and with my normal or telephoto lens stopping down to f/8 or f/11 or even f/16.  You can see a lot of other sample images of what these Raynox lenses do by doing an image search with the DCR-150 search word.  It's also worth noting that Flickr has several groups that are dedicated to photos taken with these close-up accessories.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game. Fun to play. Difficult at times. You can't stop playing it once you've started. I love it. Amazing all around!
B002LU0E26|5.0|This movie is so good.  You must watch it again.  I wish they would make a Superman Returns part 2
B005PK57NU|4.0|The story evolves around and lady lawyer.  There is always a new problem that has to be handled by the main character.
B006TKP2B2|2.0|I was intrigued by this book when I first started reading it.  OK, so the Thai names were difficult to navigate, but the concept seemed interesting enough.  One reviewer had mentioned the excessive fragments as an issue, but I saw them merely as a stylistic attempt at mimicking the &#34;Heechy-Keechy&#34; movements of the wind-up.  As the book progressed, however, the the stylistic benefit was replaced by unnecessary fragmentation.  It did not advance the plot in any way.  More importantly, however, was the story line itself.  Bacigalupi spent a significant amount of time developing certain characters - their motives and their histories - but there was never a pay-off.  Entire story lines seemed to disappear and in the last 30% of the book, the plot was rushed to the point of absurdity.  Bacigalupi should have developed the story more and yes, lengthened the story in order to have made it less of a waste of my time.
B00CWVGBEO|2.0|Lots of action, but the car chases were ridiculous. Over the top killings with exploding heads etc. Why would the 'bad guys' have<br />RPGs and large caliber automatic weapons. The one thing I thought was believable was the guy firing the large calibre hand gun, that was warned to watch out for the recoil. Wham, Right in the face. Funny. But why do I say believable? I once fired my brother's 44 magnum (looked similar to the movie one). It felt like someone hit me in the palm with a baseball bat. Even though I heeded his advice to grip it tightly I wouldn't fire it again. Overall, I rate this one 2 1/2 stars. Sorry.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|this game is great if you like role playing games this game really kills time I play this game for hours and hours at a time.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Jane Austen's Persuasion is beautifully written. I could not read fast enough! I laughed out loud, I disliked characters and prayed for others. It was exciting; I thought my heart would stop a few times. Perfect tale of love and sacrifice.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|No hints (without asking), no dialogue, no directions. I feel like a CIA cadet being dropped in the middle of Alaska: excited.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|A surprisingly good book, maybe because this is not my usual genre. Good read for guys or girls. Quick paced and enjoyable.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I can't wait to play it ! Soon as I get up on my lunch break on the ride home .I love it !!!!!I'm trying to be number one !!! Well back to the dash!!!
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Good story, it iswell written. I realy got the feel of the country and how the people live and think.
B005FMB8X6|5.0|I saw this lineup on SNL for the first time. It took me a bit to adjust to the \\"new wave\\" King Crimson. (King Crimson has always been my favorite band).  But man, how fantastic!  I wonder if Beat and Three Of A Perfect Pair will get the 40th anniversary treatment?  Does anyone know?
B004APVI1G|5.0|Truly enjoyed this film.<br />Quality of animation is absolutely stunning, and the 3D effects only add to the fun. :)<br />I'm not going to spoil the story, but I think it's a tale that's enjoyable for all ages.<br />Can't wait for the sequel.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is without a doubt the best game that I have ever played!  I love how Kiloo created the game.  In my opinion it is 100% + better than temple run.  On here u swipe across the screen to move not struggle tilting the screen to move.  The coolest thing is that u can earn enough $ to buy hoverboards and really cool characters.  And u can play it anywhere.  No joke.  This incredible game requires no wifi.  Getting this game is a decision u wont regret!  Even my mom and grandma like it!
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|Preside Lincoln is truly my favorite president. I don't know why writers have to ruin a potentially great film for the whole family with gratuitous cussing in the first 1/2 hour of the movie.<br />Our country was founded on freedom of religion. Most people back in those days had some kind of abiding belief in God. So it is inconceivable to me that so many people would be cussing AT God and using his name in vain.<br />That's a deal breaker for.My family. People around you are going to cuss, I can not control it. But if you are going to use God's name in vain I don't have to sit there and subscribe to it. I turned off the movie, no matter how good it's suppose to be.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I hadn't picked up a new book in a few years. Thanks to Kindle for Android I'm on my third book already.<br />Works well, no problems running the app on a Samsung Stratosphere 2.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My wife got me playing Flow Free and its turned to be quite a compulsive game. It starts easy enough but suddenly it gets seriously challenging - at the moment we are both stumped on both our respective games and though we could buy \\"hints\\" we really want to solve the game for ourselves.The game has quite a satisfying feel to it and when you've got the feel for it the action can be quite fast.
B008Q0AZVK|3.0|A well cast, well acted drama with good cinematography that leaves you asking &#34;that's it?&#34; Now I want to know how the book ended.
B003O86FMW|2.0|Whereas there was much time and thought put into crafting the world of &#34;The Hunger Games,&#34; I felt like the sequel was made because a publishing company knew it would be a good sell - not because the author knew it would be a good book. It felt contrived.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Love this, versitle and user friendly. Having fun exploring all that kindle has to offer. Keep these helpful and free asp coming.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I could not put this dark thriller down.  The characters all had a secret or so they thought.  Going back home is not always what you expect it to be.
B00AYQNOFI|4.0|Very interesting movie.  Except for one scene that doesn't make any sense it was nice change from the ordinary movies.
B0058VW36U|1.0|I paid for it.  But it still advertises.  It also requires my amazon application to be logged in.  I fear my son spending on amazon when he gets my device because the amazon app doesn't ask for a password when it buys stuff.
B00CZXIVNI|5.0|This album has songs that just make you feel good. It would be hard to stay sad or made while listening to these songs. 24/seven and Get Up are really good dance songs. I would recommend this album to anyone.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Got a great deal on this and the show is simply fantastic. A friend of mine suggested I check out the series and I was very pleased with the action and pace of the show. There are some really tense moments in alot of episodes and the acting is fantastic. Plus everyone is in fantastic shape and worked hard to be to truly capture the role of Gladiators. Fantastic and a much watch for fans of action and brotherhood type shows.
B0031R5K68|3.0|While I loved the DaVinci Code, this sequel for me is too heavy on Freemasonry and too light on character development. Granted, we all know Robert Langdon, but I would have liked to see more explanation of relationship between the characters and more plot description - the storytelling is chopped up with too much repetition of the &#34;legends&#34; of the Masons.
B00A85EMVK|3.0|Having watched the original 2D version many times, the 3D effect didn't do much for me.  But, of course it is still a good movie with a great soundtrack.  The money would have been better spent on a movie that had not been seen before.
B007HACDLK|5.0|great read. I'll miss Vince! RIP. I would love it if this was made in to a movie. Wonder how would play Mitch?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game and can't wait for the next level to come out! This game really makes you think about how to put all the pieces together.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I first bought this book when it came out on paperback. Since I'm a soldier and things like space and weight DO matter, I bought the Kindle edition. I'm happy to say that it is as good as it was a decade ago. King has this down-to-earth style peppered with a few choice words, which can be either sophisticated and coarse in equal parts.<br />  It was a real two-in-one book for me, a look at King's past and a lesson in writing. While I don't agree wholeheartedly with everything he wrote, I will admit that I have much to learn. This book is definitely a must-have if you're learning how to write, are an aspiring writer, simply a King fan, or all of the above in my case. I will read this book again and again, and I think you will be glad you picked up this book.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|I love me some Channing Tatum. This movie is a must see for any woman. It is a really great movie
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I think this is the best of all the Fringe seasons. With alternate worlds who knows what all might be possible
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Well thought out.  Great graphics. Addicting.  Thought provoking.  unfortunately,  too short. Finished in a day.  Left me wanting more. More please!
B003QS9WIE|5.0|Very trippy. The acting was great, very subtle- so subtle in fact that I had to see it a few times to understand fully what happened :)
0786186291|5.0|This is a great audio book to listen to. It gives more detail of how life was on the high seas back in the early days. It's also a great story that goes back to the beginning of how the captain and doctor from Master and Commander Far Side of the World came to know each other.
1616550414|5.0|ok, im lying actually, im not really a hardcore fan for the LOZ, but i do got to admit that this book has it all! history story, character bio, sketches from previous games, and a special manga origin story, its a MUST HAVE for the fans, and people like me who really wants to know the LOZ universe, love it!
B00CATSONE|5.0|Well written, concise and informative. Everyone should know about Tesla's brilliant mind, endless creativity, selfless character and contributions to our world.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Have seen this movie several times and love it! Can't wait for the sequels to come. Good quality pictures and sound
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I've never read Nicholas Sparks and I could not put this book down! It kept my interest it's definitely not the sappy cliche' love story I thought would disappoint me. It is a very good read!!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I loved being able to watch as many episodes as I wanted by buying the entire season, I think this is one of the best series EVER!  Too bad I didn't read the books but really enjoying watching.  Make sure to buy season 2 !
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like the game fine. I am just used to adventure games that have a bit more challenge to it.<br />Don't get me wrong. It's a great game. It has cool audio and music. Audio is best using a headphone.<br />And detailed graphics.
B00CATSONE|3.0|For some reason I thought this was going to be the life story of Nikola Tesla filled with math and logic; I was not expecting a tangent about baseball players and brain development.  This book was easy enough to read, but it seemed more like an essay about the importance of imagination and how without it the world wouldn't work, which is obvious enough.<br /><br />The most amazing thing about this book are Tesla's inventions and I really, really wanted more details about them; for example the first radio.  And I was also surprised about the war between Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla and how no matter what, Tesla still managed to invent and find investors.  All that aside, there wasn't a scrap of information about Tesla himself; such as, did he get married?  Kids?  Personal beliefs?<br /><br />I do appreciate the author's clear admiration for Tesla, but I think it needed more historical fact.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Interesting, challenging, fun puzzles, nice graphics, easy to navigate, simple to figure out gameplay without the need for a lot of instructions or help. Wish there were more rooms, it was over too soon.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is surprisingly difficult which makes it so much fun.  After playing Angry Birds I can't help but not sympathize with the pigs now.  They are so cute and once you understand how much work it took to build these devices, you don't want to play Angry Birds and knock them down.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I am really enjoying this game and would highly recommend it.  If you like mystery<br />you will really like this game
B00CWY76CC|5.0|10 levels?  That's it?  Once you master clicking on walls and plants, you'll never look at your walls again.  This game is so much fun and I like how each level is more and more complex.  An excellent game.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Loved this game!<br />Free game from Amazon.  Can't wait to try more like this.  If you like adventure games this one is for you.
B0096HIEE2|1.0|Subject matter was terrible, acting was horrendous and I cannot believe that I paid to hear the f bomb repeated over and over again.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|The greatest documentary you will ever see.<br />Quiet astonishing. The music is fabulous<br />Here is a Renaissance Man if there ever was one.<br /><br />AJ
B0046B1KHG|5.0|This is a very cute movie.  I and my 5 year old son love it!  We'll watch it for years to come!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Only thing wrong with this third installment of the series is being left hanging and not knowing when the fourth book comes out!
B003Z49LYO|5.0|This movie is definitely memorable and sad, based on the classic novel.  Women were not treated well in the1700-1800s and this movie portrays this them well, along with the &#34;double standard&#34; of morality.<br />The movie is engrossing and well done.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|My wife and I have been watching the series on HBO. I found it difficult to keep up with all the characters, i.e. who is who and related to whom, on the show but the book, now that I have gotten into it, explains it all.  The author has a great imagination and does a good job of keeping it all tied together but it can still be a little complicated to follow.
B000ID37RM|5.0|It's been years since I first saw this movie, and I was so impressed with the acting, and of course the classical historical tale about growing up in the South in the 1950s.  This movie leaves you feeling sad for the racism and human cruelty that existed then.
B00688628M|5.0|I would put this Mini-Series in the top 5 ( you want a taste a Battle Fear, Courage, and Friendship) along with 'The Pacific', ''From the earth to the moon', 'Homeland', 'Hannibal','Everest',<br />For me being able to and wanting to step into each of the characters journey into death and somethings back to 'getting busy living',<br />brings humanity of our history fully revealed ,<br />Bravo!!!!!<br />Cant wait to watch the series again to juxtapose each Story against what narrative would going beyond my 'Breaking Point' and who would I be more then willing to give myself so that the platoon could fight on.<br />A
B005UDD1R6|3.0|I am still trying to figure out what and how to work this. I can only guess it's ok for those smarter than me to figure it out.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book keeps you interested & wanting more. Can not wait for the next book to find out what is in-store for all the character's.
B0018QOIXU|3.0|I found this cd to be dull.  The music all sounded the same and not uplifting.  Compared to her current 21, it deserves from me, an okay
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Daughter loved it. Great realistic features. Always wanted a horse of her own until we get one this will do
B00AM7E4LM|4.0|If you want to put your hands on something worth to learn and quickly. Here's the perfect book to guide you in achieving the proper mindset.
B000I8ES5C|5.0|This movie is comedy gold and the martial arts are off the chain.<br />Stephen Chow is so funny!! The one is on my top 10 list!!
B0097HSS4M|5.0|did a couple of pictures & liked the results very much.  I love photography very much & am always taking pics.  Than you not only have the memory, but a pic of the people you care about.  No one is here forever & to me, having their pictures, has great value.
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|I like Mark Walberg and most of his movies, but this one was not all that great.<br />Better as a rental or on the movie channel.  Don't buy it!!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I couldn't put this book down. Missed sleep and all. The ending was very, very disappointing.  Seems like the author left it for a sequel. Not fair. Romachey
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I rented this one on a rainy day and it was really good!!!<br />I will be adding this one to my Amazon collection for good!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a good version of Spider and great for a freebe!  Would recommend to anyone who likes a daily game of Spider.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well I think of subway surfers as a addictive game you guys did a good job with the game it is fun and amazing game for kids grownups and everybody and that is what I think of subway surfers
B004UID2LC|1.0|This app sucks! It looks completely different from the regular YouTube! Do not get this app! There's actually no reason for it because you cam just go on Silk.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|AMAZING!!!!! So heart touching! Best teenage love story of two cancer patients! One you can't put down! A must read!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is amazing and is really fun to play in hd! It has really nice quality too and the game is better
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game lots of fun good w a y to kill time my kid loves to play it to could use less truck break downs downsides up the good work g 5
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really fun and well organized game! Each month the theme changes! It is so fun! Then there are weekly challenges and daily challenges!
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I do have fun playing this game. I just wish it wasn't so hard to get land. But for the most part I have a good time.
B008OM0EDO|5.0|This movie was soo freakin funny, I had almost pissed my self! You should def. watch it, it's worth it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game. I got caught a couple times , but it was fun to work out all the solutions.  Wish there were a few more levels.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|no era lo q esperaba de space a birds. lo baje pero no m gusto mucho .  prefiero seasons , esta mas o menos
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I love this, does everything they. You dont find that too much anymore.They give us a great write up only to find that it's crap
B00CF34B2I|5.0|While browsing through the reviews I noticed a few angry costumers complaining about the following reasons:    1. The game is too big, takes too much space NO S***!! it is supposed to take that much space otherwise the game would be crap!    2. Does not work on the original Kfire, I downloaded it on my Kfire first and it worked like a charm.    3. You have to spend money to get cards. Welcome to the real world ladies and gentlemen, this is what you get for downloading a free game.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|It was really good until the last book.  Then it seemed she lost interest in her characters.  I would still recommend the series.
B000TEUSJK|3.0|Anybody buying this movie knows what they are getting. The movie never has looked good, and this transfer is poor.  I dont know why they say it is a new digital transfer as there is nothing improved about it.  This IS the unrated version, so it surely is what it says.
B00165RLWI|4.0|this album is just what I remembered. Fun easy to sing-along 80's synth pop. Even 30 years later hungry like a wolf is one of my favorites form the era
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Action packed, great special effects. A star studded cast. What else could you ask for? It is like no other super hero movie I have ever seen.
B00A9X7X6C|1.0|I did not really like this film. Then again, I am not a movie film expert. It just wasn't what I was expecting from the previews.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game to pass the time with. Puzzles are not too hard yet still somewhat challenging. And it is free!
B0000931QA|5.0|MASTERPIECE insane music insane story. I lost this disc about 10 years ago and just now replaced it. it never gets old
B005S9EJ14|2.0|What a let down! This movie had so many great actors and actresses but it failed to deliver. Maggie Smith seemed to carry the whole movie in her wheelchair. She saved Marigold for me.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I reallly like to play bingo. This particular game is very tight when it comes to daily credits. I am on level 71 and get awarded 18 credits every 24 hours. This is ridiculous when two cards on Level 71 costs me 18 credits. It is a losing battle. I would recommend the Slotomania method of awarding credits or coins every four hours. This at least keeps you coming back. On a more positive note, the music played in the different bingo cities and the number callers accents are a delight.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Although the singing was not that great in some instances, the acting & the story made up for it.  Great movie
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|Was not that familiar with Mad Season when this album was first issued back in the 90's.  I'm glad I found it now.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is great for people of all ages and you will become addicted to it right away I love it and I think you will too its great!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Wonderful puzzles, graphics and sound effects. Very creative and full of novel content. I would like to see more timed puzzles in future Rooms.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game to play to pass time. It does get challenging, but in a fun way where it's not too hard to figure out the clues!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game to get your mind thinking. Almost would like to see it get progressively harder.  And more levels would be rather nice.
B00CBKVMG8|5.0|Although this film was fairly graphic and violent the story line and acting were excellent. I highly recommend to any action lovers.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I enjoy the game to point, but it depends on you having a Facebook account and that is way to annoying and frustrating.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|I wasn't all that thrilled while reading the book, but the book was even better than the movie. Very predictable.
1118488768|5.0|If you're reading this, you're probably considering buying the 4th edition of David Meerman Scott's The New Rules of Marketing & PR.<br /><br />The are a couple of things you should bear in mind.<br /><br />One is that, as a leading thought leader, David Meerman Scott \\"walks the walk.\\" In contrast to a lot of \\"experts\\" who write about online marketing, the New Rules of Marketing & PR reflects original thinking, based on his career since 2002. David Meerman Scott practices what he preaches.<br /><br />As he tells his story in the Introduction, (which you can read by clicking the Look Inside! book cover image, above), David understands media from an insider perspective. He knows media from multiple perspectives. He knew how the press operated, and he knows how it operates today. This is especially evident in Chapter 23, Newsjacking, one of the new chapters.<br /><br />At one time, David controlled multi-million dollar corporate marketing budgets, but realized that, as Bob Dylan said, \\"the times they are a'changing.\\"<br /><br />What you get in the 4th edition of The New Rules of Marketing & PR is based on what worked for him in the early years of the previous decade. David pioneered the (at the time) revolutionary view of giving drafts of chapters of the first edition of his book away for free, before his book was published to great success. Over the years, he's repeated and perfected the technique, to increasing success.<br /><br />Second, there's the important element of refinement. Through the previous editions of The New Rules of Marketing & PR, David has been continuously refining and updating his ideas to reflect developing technology.<br /><br />The 4th edition is as up-to-date as Obama's re-election, the mistakes that many corporations made last year following Hurricane Sandy, and what happened during the the SuperBowl \\"blackout\\" this year.<br /><br />In addition, since the first edition, David has been communicating--through his blog and e-mail--with owners and managers of a broad range of businesses, agencies, associations, and nonprofits. He's listened to their stories and updated dozens of examples throughout the book.<br /><br />The 4th edition reflects a major rewrite, with over 70 pages of new material, including two new chapters reflecting the latest technology. You'll learn about the latest online social media tools, and how you can use each to tell your story. You'll also discovers how others are doing it, as well as ideas and tips for using each tool.<br /><br />Third, I continue to be impressed by how David Meerman Scott not only describes what he did, but he is a careful writer. He writes the way he speaks.<br /><br />As someone who has interviewed him several times since the first edition, I'm impressed by the way David can says a lot in a conversational tone, carefully choosing his words, and lacing them with examples and how-to tips. Such writing doesn't come naturally. You have to work at it to get it right.<br /><br />Thus, the 4th edition of The New Rules of Marketing & PR is a \\"safe\\" book to buy, even if you're familiar with the previous editions. Of course, if you're new to David Meerman Scott and his story, you have a lot of pleasant reading ahead of you!
B002WV5A9G|4.0|It was good, but not great. Entertaining but I don't think there was a lot of character development. Good when you need a mindless movie.
B008602KQI|3.0|Although quite some time as elapsed since I read the book, I did not find the movie (as seen on my computer) to be as riveting as I found the book.
B003XVYLDU|3.0|Interesting read however not much of a plot. I read it because it is supposed to be on of the top 10 all time sci-fi books. It would not have made it into my top 100
B008M36ER0|5.0|Action and Mel Gibson...need I say more? Good rainy evening entertaining, get some pop-corn and enjoy the show, we did!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|So time consuming.  Too many pop up advertisements that irritate me to no end.  Not much communication, only people talking about themselves.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|First, I would not recommend this problem to anyone. It cumbersome and does not work smoothly. When I finally got into it there were only 3 channels and they were ones I had never heard of. A TV in a restaurant with no sound would be a far better experience and you could have an iced tea or coffee while you watched. Forget this software and try something else.
B0077EBWVI|3.0|This movie held my attention, even though it was a bit cheesy. The underlying theme was well presented and it was a good flick to watch on a rainy afternoon.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was really hoping to have a large portion of the book cover the story line with the occasional sex scenes however the book turned out to be the opposite. There were chapters going into great detail about their relationship but would not continue the story. If I had not downloaded this to my kindle it too would have been returned. The first two books were so awesome that I even pre-ordered this one (something I NEVER do). Not sure if I'll be up for purchasing book four...
B008XKSW7M|1.0|This movie was a total waste of time and effort - don't waste yours.  I stopped watching after about 20 minutes.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Great cast... Rooney... she can be creepy and twisted! Can't wait to see more of her in the future.. an oscar is in her future.
B008GAZNEO|4.0|well written...factually sound without being overly statistical.  Insightful, and balanced for an emerging countries investor who wants an overview of investment opportunities.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Suspenseful!! I just like it. Plain and simple. Twelve more words are required. I don't have anything else to say. I just like the show!
0446547638|5.0|Nicholas Sparks delivers another book filled with pure love, loss, and drama.  Usually, I don't care for books that jump around from storyline to storyline touching a variety of characters with no apparent connection.  However, throughout this book, especially at the end, one could sense Sparks was putting together the clues for the conclusion.  Some negative reviews state that it was a predictable ending, which I could agree with.  However, the way Sparks pieced together the clues, I could see several possible endings so I wanted to keep reading to discover which one he chose.<br /><br />I do agree with some of the negative reviews that the characters were similar to other characters by Sparks (Allie and Noah/Amanda and Dawson) however, I think their motivations are different and that makes all the difference.  While The Notebook is an unabashed love story, this book has a message that everything happens for a reason, even terribly painful things.  If readers read this book and think about the step by step progression of events, it shows the skill and craftmanship of Sparks and his understanding of life.  Life isn't always beautiful and wonderful, but the painful parts have a purpose that usually yield riches beyond our imagination.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent book.  I finished it yesterday and I am still thinking about it and mulling over the details today.  I can't wait for the next Sparks book.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|One of the best Jack Reacher books I've read.  Brought me immediately to the next in the series.  Reacher taught me how I always over pack for trips!

B004KPQK2S|4.0|Mostly very good acting and solid cinema. This is an inspirational flick for those who need cheered up when the world gets you down.
B005QI4TP8|3.0|I bought this cd for my sister. According to her, she says the singer's lyrics focus to much on the devil and had a hard time getting past that. So from her point of view, she says, it's ok.

B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I was not sure if I would enjoy it as I read book number two first. I enjoyed it more so then book two. Would recommend it. It story is sweet and sincere, I wish all books ended this way.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It gives you a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. Just when about give up, you figure it out.  Finished in a few hours.
B00BB22GSU|5.0|This album is a bit different from VW's other two. After listening to it for a few days it really won me over.
B00338QENI|4.0|This book was came highly recommended to me and I think that I was expecting more.  Certainly a well researched book but I wished it was a little shorter.  Maybe I got so I didn't really care by the end.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I wanted this movie to be good. I really did. I love James Franco (even though he is often in bad movies) and I love Oz and I love the L. Frank Baum books. But this movie just really wasn't good.  A predictable plot. Poor writing. Stereotypical characters. Wooden performance from Franco. Nice art direction and costuming, though.  It kept my interest, but I'll never watch it again and I don't recommend it.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|The Clifton Chronicles are a fun read but a fair investment of time.  Although I enjoyed them and he writes well if you haven't read some of his other works then don't start here.
0307276902|4.0|I read this book thinking it was a biographical account of the author's life, then I found the clip from Oprah where the author admitted he has fabricated the book.  As long as you read this as a fictional account, then it is a great book.
B00633W614|3.0|Good but not his best book.  Three volumes is a bit of an investment but they read well.  If you haven't read some of his other stories then don't start here.  Some of his other tales are more intesting.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Got this app for my granddaughter and she loves it. She talks to the horse while playing the game. Loves that it ask her to pet the horse.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was super fun.  It is a fantasy mystery, where the author strategically doles out information at a wonderful pace.  Read it!
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|V.E.T(my son) can't get enough of dinosaurs, just love's them, and in this game you take care of most of there needs. The only draw back is that you can use real money if you don,t have it set up not too.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Well written, great read, just one of those books that you couldn't put down at all!! You won't be disappointed.

B008JJM88Q|4.0|I've played this game maybe 50 times and with a dozen exceptions, I used names that I thought would be obscure enough to stump it. Well I did a few times, but the rest of the time I was pretty amazed at how it picks the right answer. I guess it also shows how much of a &#34;cultural mind&#34; we have that so many people pick the same names to try to fool it. Try it, you'll like it.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|bad ass game just it wold b better if u could get everything wit coins. its hard to get the metals and hearts without money

B00005ASOC|5.0|What's the biggest secret you ever kept? Sneaking out past curfew, smoking pot behind the garage? What if this secret wasn't yours to tell? Do you think that would make it easier or harder to keep?<br /><br />  Jamal Wallace (played by Rob Brown) is a basketball player in the Bronx. When we enter the story, he's recently taken academic assessment tests and, in contrast to his work in class, has scored high enough to gain the attention of the school board. On top of this, it is mentioned that Jamal (Brown) is an exceptional basketball player. One night, after a successful game, he is sharing a meal with friends at a restaurant. They discuss, among other things, a neighborhood resident who is something of an urban legend, referred to simply as \\"the window\\" because he never leaves his apartment. A common tradition among the group is for one member to dare another. One of the men dares Jamal to break into \\"the window's\\" apartment and return with something from inside. Jamal enters the apartment and sees a letter opener shaped like a knife but, much to his surprise, \\"the window\\" catches him, yelling loudly and inspiring Jamal to flee. Until his mother makes him aware of the fact, he never realized that he left his backpack in the apartment. That's set aside, briefly, when he meets with an admissions officer from an expensive private school, as a result of his test scores. When his mother says they couldn't possibly afford the tuition, the school official says that if Jamal were to continue playing basketball with the same skill for his new school, that tuition will not be an issue. In the time since, Jamal's backpack was unceremoniously dropped from \\"the window's\\" apartment and the notebooks inside, all containing creative writing of Jamal's, now with editorial comments written with a red pen. Jamal approaches the apartment, this time using the front door, and asks \\"the window\\" if he would read more of his writing.<br /><br />  I truly love this movie. Brown as Jamal Wallace is a character you cannot help but like, despite his momentary foray into delinquency. \\"The Window\\" who is later identified as a renowned author who became a recluse decades before we're introduced to him. \\"The Window\\", played by Sean Connery, is a very sympathetic character and, as he takes on the role of mentor to Brown's character, the audience is given the opportunity to see it change both of their lives for the better. Until recently, I hadn't watched this film for some time. Since watching it again, I have no idea why it took me this long. You should see this movie as soon as you can.lace is a character you cannot help but like, despite his momentary foray into delinquency. \\"The Window\\" who is later identified as a renowned author who became a recluse decades before we're introduced to him. \\"The Window\\", played by Sean Connery, is a very sympathetic character and, as he takes on the role of mentor to Brown's character, the audience is given the opportunity to see it change both of their lives for the better.

B005LAIIPS|4.0|The original was conditioned and brainwashed , but now the victim is chemically enhanced and mentally altered . Starts with a lot of scenes from the last movie .
B005K0HDGE|5.0|moving pretty fast.  nice combination of  romance and intrigue  this book is a little different from some of the author's earlier works  I think it is a good summer beach book
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I was having battery-charging problems with my Kindle Fire and learned about this app on a trouble-shooting site. It's delightful to know how much time is available for particular functions -- reading vs. web surfing vs. video watching, for example.

B005DC68NI|3.0|Love, love, love the indie author stories!!!<br /><br />My advice, skip straight to part three. Part One and Two are a tad long and a teeny bit out of date. But how funny that a book written in 2011 about ebook publishing already needs updating - this shows you how fast the digital book world is moving.<br /><br />But just the unique and fascinating success stories in \\"part three\\" of this book is worth the price.<br /><br />This author also has an awesome new book called \\"Get Visible\\" that was published in 2013 that is awesome, timely, and useful.<br /><br />This is a very caring and wonderful writer and if I had read this book even a year ago, I would have been wowed by the info. Perhaps he will soon start to follow the trend of other ebook authors and update timely information inside his ebook every three to six months.<br /><br />The way I found this book was kind of sad and kind of funny though.<br /><br />I was doing one of my \\"kindle book frolics\\" (where one book leads to another and another within the same topic) and after reading \\"The Kindle Publishing Bible\\" (which is fabulous btw) - a mention in this book got me to read \\"Secret Amazon Hacks and Other Cool Tricks For Kindle Authors\\" which had some great sneaky tricks and advice - which lead me to leave a super positive review.<br /><br />Then I popped onto the reviews of \\"Secret Amazon Hacks\\" trolling for more books to read (yeah, I read kind of crazy-fast) and I encountered probably the most vicious yet articulate review of any book that I've ever seen.<br /><br />And strangely enough, inside of this throat-slitting review was a recommendation for this  great \\"Get Digital\\" book (which I promptly bought - hee hee - cuz I was on roll, right?).<br /><br />And what's funny about this mean review (that had like 89 \\"this is helpful\\" clicks) was that the basis for it was a few typos and the fact that the author of \\"Secret Amazon Hacks\\" was under this misconception that \\"gifting a book to a reviewer\\" was against amazon policy (which I put under the better-safe-than-sorry category since amazon and google's policies are changing so rapidly).<br /><br />But this reviewer made this brainy super nerdy writer of \\"Secret Amazon Hacks\\" look like a dunce. It even worked on me for a minute - making me feel embarrassed at giving \\"Secret Amazon Hacks\\" a good review.<br /><br />So I read this \\"oh so much smarter than the rest of us\\" nasty reviewer's recommended book - then I went back and re-read \\"Secret Amazon Hacks\\" and I slapped myself for ever recanting my thought that it was anything but \\"cutting edge\\" and brilliant.<br /><br />Now if you consume as many kindle books as I do, you are willing to put up with a typo or two if the information is \\"cutting edge\\" as long as 99% of the info is dead on correct.<br /><br />I don't know any of these authors (or this mean reviewer) - and maybe I'm too much of an overprotective mom type - but I kind of think there should be a rule that all \\"one star\\" reviews should give the author a week to respond and correct the problem inside his book before posting.<br /><br />And reviewers probably shouldn't be allowed to slam one book with a \\"one star\\" then recommend another inside the review. It makes the author of the book they are recommending look bad - or maybe like they are in on it - which I'm sure this writer wasn't.<br /><br />And like I said earlier, this book is definitely worth the money. I'm serious when I say that the bios of indie authors will totally pump you up!!! This writer is talented, warm hearted, and easy to read.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Many of the songs on Rod Stewart's newest CD bring back memories of when he was young and singing &#34;Maggie May&#34;.  Most are upbeat and fun.  However, the last song on the CD, &#34;Pure Love&#34; is a beautiful song of the love by a father for his daughter.

B005D4YOL4|3.0|So, I ordered size 15 because my feet are a size 15 measured to the ball of the foot.  Unfortunately, I have short toes so I'm a size 14 overall.  The first day I wore these my right foot was comfortable but my left foot developed a blood blister at the back of the big toe - right where the molded ridge that's supposed to be behind the toes hits my short toes.  I also have a mild problem with my big toenails.  I have a fungus problem that makes them big and gnarly and, even after filing the left big toenail with the same file I use on my axe, I get pressure on that nail from the wraparound.  I'm still wearing the shoes and trying to make the left one fit.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence's performance adds humanity to a premise that is appalling...children killing children, really?  Animal Farm not withstanding, a society that would pit it's children against each other to prevent it's past misdeeds from being repeated, runs the risk of simply repeating the mistakes of the past.  The Lawrence character rises above and proves that humanity can reach the highest levels when faced with a choice. This performance brings the theme full circle.<br /><br />Teach them war, to know war no more, makes no sense and on a societal level will always fail.  An old adage, \\"...power is best used as little as possible or not at all...\\", even when faced with an existential threat. Talk about, \\"speaking softly and carrying a big stick\\"? Throw the hornets nest at them first, then the arrow, first as weapon and then as instrument of mercy.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I have read all of the series and I was really quite bored with this one. I do like parts of the book, but overall it could have been written better. It seems like she was in a hurry to finish the series.

She fell asleep within 15 minutes and I was ended up being hooked, laughed almost the entire way through.  Good movie, very relatable if you have or are trying to have kids.

B004L49K20|5.0|This is easily one of the best Duran Duran albums and proves they still have talent. There have been a few low points over the years, but they always come back to try again.  Producer Mark Ronson worked well with the group to blend a modern interpretation of the early Duran Duran synth-pop sound. 180 degree improvement after the Timberlake/Timbaland over-produced Red Carpet Massacre.
B00821OX98|5.0|This series is great. I wasn't able to catch it during the initial broadcast but more. I love the characters and how the writers have developed story lines around the resistance against the aliens as will as the  dissension among the humans. Close Encounters with the not so friendly aliens
B004R13U6Y|5.0|Very good job. Like everything about the application.<br />Love the nice and well thought display of the &#34;Recent&#34; pages.<br />Like the colors and the document annotations features.<br />Considering what you can do with it, this app is really affordable.<br />I still don't know how to print document from this app. Thank you so much for making it available.
B001XCWPAM|4.0|Regarding the package; got the British version of the box set for considerably cheaper than the American at the time.  No problem w/ region lock.  My family and I just watched these three again after watching Legacy (which is a step down).  We were continually pleased w/ the strength of this trilogy.  The storyline and execution is as taut and coiled as Bourne himself (amnesiac assassin attempts to piece together his entire identity and the damage that occurs with helpers and hinderers).  The Blu-ray quality was very very good and got stronger each film.  It's rare to have a trilogy with such strong individual offerings, but Bourne is exactly that.  Highly recommended.
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|I was hoping for more of a storyline. Maybe some other emotion than anger and vengeance.  Was a little disappointed in it.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|This was no four start movie. Its heavy fantasy and just didn't do it for me.<br />May be interesting for the kids as a airport movie.<br />Glad I didn't spend the cash in the theater.
B001R6AW18|5.0|This by far, the best rendition of this film I have ever seen. But, I would recommend that before you view it, go to Wikipedia and view the history of how it was made. That will make the viewing much more enjoyable. Example: one of the models for Kong was only 18 inches tall, the other 24 inches. The clarity and sound are great for a film this old.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|loved this game so addicted to it. can play for hours and never gets boring.  can't wait for the next version  to come out. Great game
B008MWBY6W|2.0|The quality of the case seems OK, but the quality of the strap (specially the clips that hold the strap to the case) is pretty bad.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I can just glance at this and it is big enough and easy to see that I know when my Kindle needs charging.  A good APP to download
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The book would be better with more romance and less kinky stuff. The story line gets really good at the end of this book.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|A colorful story and great insight into Mumbai slum life!  I suggest that this book is worth reading more than once.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This game is quite challenging. I enjoy this type of game so it makes this one of my favorites. I recommend it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book. I feel so happy for Peeta and Katniss. I feel bad for Katniss though because she lost prim. You should make more hunger games books...
B008HFWF3U|4.0|A great sound and look for some old favorites.  Also some good songs I had not heard  before. A good purchase.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book. Almost made me cry when Gale said there was no more district 2 :'(. Also I almost cried when Peeta was captured by the Capital.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I found the series interesting because you are watching from the perspective of the servants more than the Home owner's.  It also shows sin, forgiveness, bitterness and compassion from the rich as well as the servants.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Interesting story so up on present times with so many young men going off to war. Ur chased at amazom
0062218867|2.0|Despite the preponderance of scatological humor, there was nothing funny at all in this book. Terry Pratchett is my favorite author because of his intricately woven dry humor. There was none of that in Snuff. And the political commentary would have been timely in the eighties, but it's cliched now. My theory is that the rumored alzheimers set in and someone else wrote this for him.
0891419063|5.0|The personal outlook on this story show all of Sledge's personal Opinions - Not there but have been told by several Marine Buddies that were in the Peleliu operation  that this was the Toughest Battle the Marines had all WWII -<br />The Marines were really not trained to do the type of fighting that our Army does and they found this out on Okinawa - It is amazing that Army and Marine Units were able to work together as well as they did -<br /><br />Our Military Casualties in Okinawa exceeded all the Casualties we have had in the Terrorist War for the last 12 years -<br />Mentioned - - - to show - - - the American KIA price - - - paid for Freedom was a lot higher - - - but thanks to our Great Nation developing the finest Military in the whole world, we have saved many thousand American Mi;itary Lives - - - defending our Freedom since WWII! - - -  LET NO PERSON EVER APOLOGIZE FOR OUR VETERANS !

B00D2K40WY|4.0|perfect for small girls! my 4 year old can play it without asking how to do this and that every 10 seconds. Wish there were not so many items she was locked out of though.
0375842209|5.0|Its a very powerful and well written book. I recommend to this book to almost everyone. Great book, great book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Another wonderful book can't wait for the next! Its all I could have hoped for and so much more!!! I couldnt put it down. Gideon is such a great character and love how he is betrayed. Loved loved loved
B00846REIS|4.0|Great read but it seemed like she ran away every time there was a problem. I will read the series.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved the book, the only con was it was too many events happening at once other than that it kept me wanting more. Can't wait for the next one.
B00CCXL9OE|2.0|I was really looking forward to the Blu-ray edition, as this is one of my favorites.  However, it won't play on my computer, even using a brand new Blu-ray drive and the latest copy of Powerdvd. Instead it hangs with Abu waving frantically at you while it tries to load the menu. He's waving bye-bye to my $40!<br /><br />What's next, Disney?  Will the Little Mermaid be similarly unplayable?
B00C6Q511Y|5.0|This is a cute Ken doll. He joined my granddaughters huge collection of dolls, and they loved him. Worth the price.
B000FC12Z0|5.0|I believe that this is a wonderful novel to read that will never get old.  I will never get bored with reading this book.
B0094M2ITG|5.0|Whole family loved it, ages 84-13.  Not just a chick flick, the guys really enjoyed it too.  Will watch it again.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Beautifully written, psychologically stunning and will keep you guessing &#34;Why?&#34;. I love it and Mads makes an incredible Hannibal Lecter.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My only real complaint with many of these \\"escape the room\\" games is not having a solution included somewhere to help when you are really stuck... adding a text help page to an app should not be rocket science. This game is better than most and I had fun.
B0029LCJJS|3.0|I like the idea behind The Tudors, but the execution was all wrong. It did make me learn a lot more about Tudor England though because every time something was shown, I had to go to research if it was true or not...and usually it wasn't correct.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|When I first bought the app, it didn't work, but an update fixed that! I love this game! :) Thank you for fixing it.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have enjoyed all of the Sookie Stackhouse books. This final book was wonderful. I'm sad they have come to an end but I think that  Sookie came  full circle and I am happy for that! Thank you Charlaine Harris for creating a strong and smart heroine that everyone  has come to love!!!
B00881VLCE|1.0|This app just completely stopped working! So glad I paid for additional puzzles.<br />I DO NOT recommend this app at all.
1476715904|5.0|Very good writing that kept my interest.  Made you root for the characters and for making good choices. Good book.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I chose this series simply because I loved Julianna Marguilles in ER! I work pm's and when I get home at midnight, I can grab a snack, crawl in bed with my Kindle, pop in my earbuds and wind down without disturbing my hubby!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I really loved this book in the series.  I wasn't sure that I would like it because normally I live the changeling books the best but this one was well done and explained so much that I was on the edge of my seat.  I hope this isn't the end of the series,
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I started to read Safe Haven and could not put it down. It's a great story of a woman courageous enough to leave an abusive husband and try to rebuild her life all over again. She experiences the things in life that she missed when she was still in her abusive marriage.
0307950654|2.0|When the Baroness who gave us \\"An Unsuitable Job for a Woman\\" takes on Jane Austen, what we get is disappointment and tedium. P D James is rightfully hailed as one of Britain's great mystery writers, but Jane Austen is justly hailed as that country's greatest novelist.  It is an unfair match from the first ersatz-Austen opening sentence.  James just isn't Austen, and here she is mediocre James to boot.  A tepid mystery, a wimpy Mr. Darcy, all the Austen-trimmings and clich&eacute;s, and thus James has added \\"Death Comes to Pemberley\\" to the Austen-wannabes cannon.  Re-read \\"Northanger Abbey\\" if you have a hankering for some second-tier Austen.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome! Lots  of fun.  Great graphics. Challanging but not too difficult. I can't wait for more levels. Plays great on my Kindle Fire.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We just can't get enough of this show! Good story, entertaining.  keeps me wanting to watch more. My husband even watches this with me :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The Crawleys were touched by a lot of death th is season, The cliff hanger was horrible shock, but true to the time period.  I love this period drama.  The actors, the settings, and the scripts are superb.
0811879542|5.0|Very interactive, and interesting concept for a book.  Fun for kids and adults (well maybe one time for adults) Lots of fun reading over and over, and can even skip a page and it still makes sense.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|I am looking forward to watching season 5. This was the right product at a very good price. Thank you.
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|There's enough going on to keep you watching, but overall this movie is very uneven and doesn't know what it wants to be. Most of the supporting characters had roles that were underdeveloped. There are a few places where you scratch your head and say, 'huh?' and one evil character is killed off in a scene that was totally unsatisfying given the build up. Wait for it on Netflix, but I would not spend the money to rent or buy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is the best show on television in many, many years. It is interesting and engaging with a cast full of memorable characters.
B00D6SBOWG|1.0|Doesn't work on my Kindle Fire HD. Took forever to download and then wouldn't open. I played this on the PC and would love to have it on my Kindle. I guess I'll just check back for updates. :/
B002I8PVQA|5.0|Graet actors,a lot of action ,as usually R de Niro perfect in his roll.keeps the interes.Good to be watched by the whole family
B001HNE3NO|4.0|This is a moving account of a dark time. I enjoyed the cross cultural perspective and the interconnections. Zoe has the the honesty, perceptions and freshness of an intelligent and articulate teenager.  This book evoked a myriad of emotions. I read it while visiting Paris which made it somehow more real.
B005VPXNV2|4.0|James Caan is  plays a great roll<br />Very entretaining, could be watch  in a group without  ofending anyone. Yes I would recomended to adult friends
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like how challenging each floor is.  The puzzles aren't to hard and keeps you thinking.  Can't wait for new floors to come.
B006S8QY8K|5.0|Richard Gere and G  Lopez are wanderful,the rest of the actorsare not far either.<br />Enterteining I'll recomended to the &#34;very busy wife&#34;of any good husband
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love that this game never ends!  I don't mind having to come back to check on my bar.  the game is worth it.

B000002JSJ|4.0|In my opinion this is Zeppelin's finest work. No song on this album got a lot of airplay mainly because there quite lengthy. the musicianship is tremendous here. The closing number TEA FOR ONE is as good as any Zep song ever made. An interesting sidenote about this song is Joe Bonnamassa's remake of it. It must be heard!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I had looked forward to seeing this movie for some time; I wasn't disappointed.  The acting was riveting, and the story line was interesting and informative in revealing the hardships of living with bipolar disorder.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|the game takes a little while but when you figure it out its very exciting!! its very well thought out.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Left without words by another wonderful book. It never turns out how you really want it to end, but that's what makes any book good. Ridiculous to say that I'm left with tears, of happiness, and sadness. Very happy with the purchase of this book!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This is by far the best car charger for iPad and iPhone I have used. I had charges with two USB ports meant to charge simultaneously, but never did the job. I am using this for the kids iPads in the car and charges very fast.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|To be honest, I was not expecting much from this game.<br />But I was pleasantly surprised to find out how well developed this game is.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great story &amp; graphics, but must buy to get to 2nd level. Puzzles aren't too hard &amp; hidden objects are a challenge.
0553386794|4.0|Not really a fantasy book reader, however at the urging of friends decided to give this book a try.  To my surprise I liked this book.  I liked the way it was written; the characters and the plot were welll developed.  I will continue to read the series.  The book itself was in new condition and all the pages were correct (read some other reviews that said the printing of the book had some problems.)  This was the mid sized paperback and quite heavy to lug around, but worth it.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|I remember I wanted to wacht other Evangelion series, I need to catch up with this great movies!!! They're the best
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this was working fine now it won't even open...of I uninstall and re -download it I'll lose everything..you sick imangi
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. Uses lots of thought and memory skills. Too bad there are only 10 levels, I hope more levels comesoon.
B006IGZX0C|3.0|After renting the movie I discovered that it had no subtitles.  Being hearing impaired this production was not useful to me.  I went to RedBox and rented the BluRay with subtitles and enjoyed the movie immensely.
0143038419|2.0|Do not read this book - seriously. Perhaps I should not have read this as a `New York Times bestseller' but as the Chicklit that it obviously is.<br /><br />I understand how this book might resonate with millions of Western unfulfilled women but after the initial ping there is nothing else there. So, if you feel inclined to read this book because you have lost yourself somewhere down the line do not read but act instead. If you feel that the life you lead (however glorious on the outside) does not contain anything that fills your fancy and if not just the thrill but even the ripples have gone, do as the main character in this book does;<br /><br />1) Find one thing that excites you and go do that as fully and unapologetically as you can. Embrace your inner hedonist, empower your passion and kindle yourself back to life.<br />2) Sit down and listen. To any God you prefer, to nature or just your own breathing. Get in touch with the power in and outside of yourself- wherever you believe it resides. Do these things with love and compassion. Forgive if need be, understand what you can and allow what you cannot. (Feel free to add some professional counselling. A bit of cognitive behavioural therapy never hurt anyone.)<br />3) When you have the good fortune to love and be loved in return really experience it. Do not hold back, protect, strategize or manipulate but feel it.<br /><br />Do all of this and do not write a book about it.<br /><br />[...]
B005544TRQ|5.0|One of my new favorite shows that I had never heard of until I found it on amazon prime! Looking forward to more episodes and a new season starting in August of 2013! Watch the trailer and you will see why I actually wrote a review about Suits!

B008YRVW0I|4.0|I enjoy the nice relaxing fun of fishing, where you can create the aquarium of your dreams without the work that comes with the maintenance.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Very intertaining. The action a guest actors sprinkled with dark humor was awesome. The action and all of the past action figures rounded the movie out. Chuck Norris proves he is alive and still kicking very hard.
B002RXVOX0|5.0|This is a visually beautiful film.  Frank Langella is so overwhelmingly erotic. They have taken some liberties with Stoker's original novel, but that's OK because they work.  I think I've seen this film at least five times.  When it was originally released my bff and I saw it on back to back nights.  I recommend it highly.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|i think this game is very fun but gets boring i really recomend it to all ages because it makes you determind to reach a high score
B002WBZD02|5.0|Chili is one of my favorite John Travolta characters.  This movie caught the essence of the Elmore Leonard novel.  It is well acted.  Dennis Farina is a hoot.  The whole movie is just fun, fun, fun,.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Without the ending could have been brilliant, but perfection is an impossible expectation.  Attention to detail keeps you on the fence.
B00407PNY2|5.0|Steve McQueen and cast were wonderful in this movie. Best car chase scene ever<br /><br /> Between the Mustang, & The Charger !!!
1781162646|5.0|What an incredible book. I should probably tell you that I may be a bit biased as I have loved Stephen King books since I began reading, but this book was....well.....incredible. The story took me into a world that few get to see, once again. I was really surprised by who the bad guy turned out to be. Oh, yep there is a bad guy but I won't spoil it and tell you who it turns out to be and even though I was pretty sure I knew how it was going to end, I still wasn't totally prepared.
1451662440|1.0|Before starting, let me say this: I am in my 30's, and I don't blame my parents or the economy  for anything, but I'll tell you why I think Arnold is just another 'assfull' of it.<br /><br />First off, I can't possibly like someone who gets asked by someone else: 'My tuition fees went up, I am struggling, any advice? I am working part time and studying'. And Conan stares at him and thunders: 'You are wasting your life away, you only need 6 hours sleep and work work work the remaining 18'. It's really stupid to talk to someone for 30 seconds and think 'ok I have got him figured out, this guy is a lazy slob'. Wow, very nice guy, Arnold Schwarzcroft.<br /><br />The fact is, Arnold is just another d**k who, yes, worked hard (big deal, how many people there are who work their butt off?) but he also was just a lucky bod,  and thinks it was all down to his incredible efforts. In his 'rules' he says:<br /><br />-that he was marking a ROW OF STICKS on the wall for his reps. He even shows a letter with 3 sentences he practiced, with ALMOST a full row of sticks! Wow! I am so impressed by that! Brilliant!<br />Arnold, give me a break. Do you know how many people write sticks on a wall? Including me. No you don't, because you are too in love with yourself, which is pathetic.<br /><br />-to live a 'risky, spicy life'. By doing what, by being a gym rat ?<br /><br />-that the more you know, the sooner you freeze. To trust your instincts. Yep. Just get in a fighting ring and trust your instincts.<br />Arnold, I don't confuse knowledge with action. Let's just say that ONLY one or the other, will likely work out badly. You see, I don't see the world in black and white, as you do. I see it as grey.<br /><br />I am not a Schwarzenegger 'detractor' in any ways. I watched Terminator 2 repeated times. But I have to say, I think he's not a very good actor. Other guys could have done his part better. I like the movie because of the movie, not because of his acting. In fact, I think he's a very mediocre actor, and a mediocre writer too.<br /><br />His assets were his body (and he knew it, and capitalized on it, which was a wise thing to do, no doubt) and his good looks (and I am speaking as an etherosexual guy. I just mean, I suppose women and people in general 'get on' with him. It's called the 'halo effect, look it up on wikipedia. Looks will aid a lot more than people think.)<br /><br />In general, this book is full of trash. A few more examples. His thoughts are ridiculous. For example, he writes that when immigrants were saving up to buy a house, he bought an apartment building. Oooooh. Poor guy. He could only afford to buy an apartment. Tsk tsk.<br /><br />Obviously, he never has REALLY been there.<br /><br />He speaks of his success in making an investment that other people turned down because of perceived high risk. He made it anyways, and, wooo-ooooh, after 3 years the investment made money. As if the people who turned it down were idiots who defecated in their pants just because to them it wasn't a good buy? Ok Arnold, show me 100 cases where MANY experienced investors say 'mmmh, I am not going to take the risk', and THEN let's see how many good investments there would have been out of these one hundred.<br /><br />I thought this book was about surviving serious problems and making it, or about someone who made a fortune and being humbled. It's just a badly written book about a p***k in love with himself (guess how many times he looked in the mirror and drooled at his own image) who really thinks his life turned good as it is just because of his supposed 'skills'. Give me a break, Arnold, I learned to speak and write English as a self-taught and I can probably speak it better than you do. You think you are so good and special, but reality is, you are just a bragging, borish arrogant gym rat who made lots of money because he was offered roles in some good movies. As for Mr. Olympia, big deal. I guess it was easy for you to notice that the training was bearing fruit and to train harder than ever. Big deal. But I want to read a book about people who made it who had a hard life, not a poor boy who could only afford to buy an apartment building. And, WOW, he became a governor-governator (he writes it both ways) and he cut off all his SAFETY NETS by thinking 'well the worst that can happen is that I'll keep making millions by starring in movies'.<br /><br />Give me a break, Arnold. You are a p***y who thinks he's Conan. Hey, that was just a movie, get it?<br /><br />Arnold, your book and life story are trash. I am not anti-American or anything, but it's obvious you have been Americanized, your thinking is full of that trash about 'you can achieve anything', 'nothing is impossible', and thrash like that.<br /><br />If anyone has read interesting autobiographies by interesting people, especially people who REALLY showed self-discipline and courage in times of adversity, let me know. Arnold's book is trash for impressionable teenagers. One star from me. Read Niki Lauda's autobiography: that is a real high achiever, Arnold is just an uneducated, ignorant person. Only in America he could be Governor, elsewhere he'd be laughed at. I mean, read The Guardian's review of this stupid autobiography, you'll see what I mean.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|It's not any sort of magic or complicated science, sometimes it's harder than it sounds- but if you reduce your calorie intake couple of days a week (and don't binge on the other days!)- you WILL lose weight.<br />Fasting leaves you with a great feeling of cleanliness, and you honestly don't WANT put junk in your body the next day.<br />I'm a hardcore runner and had to lose some weight to better my race results, and once I lost 8lbs I planned I switched to one fast day/week (6:1) for maintenance.<br />If you're looking for a lifestyle change and not a quick easy solution, this is something you wanna try.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Danny Vito's voice just fit this Dvd. Our granddaughter was glued to the Talso v during this movie. Pretty good for granddad
B00BGIC4I6|3.0|I was expecting a more connected storyline in this film. There were some funny moments, and the acting was good, but all in all I was disappointed in the non-plot.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game rocks.<br />its like temle run but better you dodge things collect money to unlock people. its cooler than every rhing in the world
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I love Khaled Hosseini's writing. He engulfs you in his stories, everytime he gets me interested in Afghanistan. There were too many characters who took space that is unneeded. I was also a bit disappointed by the ending and felt it needed a bit more depth.<br /><br />It's not as good as Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, but still a good book to read
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I'm a big fan of the 4-hour work week and 4-hour body styles of doing things and I can say that I was in no way disappointed by this latest installment. Packed full of very useful recipes for slow-carbers and a ton of extra goodness that has way more to do with the process of learning.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|As most reviewers have mentioned, I was disappointed that this isn't the last book of the TRILOGY. I already lost my connection with both characters and don't think more books were needed.
B00DFNYN98|5.0|MAN OF STEEL delivers one of the most visual and dramatically rich films of the year. Brilliantly crafted and realized by director Zach Snyder, the film wastes not a moment in weaving a complex tapestry that redefines the greatest superhero in history on an unheard of epic scale.<br /><br />And make no mistake, this is the Superman of the 21st Century. Director Zach Snyder and writer David S. Goyer have combined elements and touches of the most definitive Superman comics and graphic novels of the character's last 27 years to insure MAN OF STEEL is a faithful reboot, unlike Bryan Singer's failed \\"Superman Returns.\\" References and scenes abound from `Man of Steel,' `Earth One,' `Secret Origin,' `Battle of the Supermen,' `Birthright,' `Last Son of Krypton,' `Secret Identity,' and `New Krypton,' along with the New 52 re-launches of `Action Comics' and `Superman.' Snyder and Goyer also courageously mix in new mythological elements that address our own world's controversial geo-political issues, all of which are grounded in the character's high morals and science-fiction mythos.<br /><br />Those with pacemakers, heart conditions or in walkers better get out of the way - this is also 21st Filmmaking at its best. Snyder has become one of the leading stylists in a new breed of directors who mix film stocks, exposure speeds, camera movement styles, visual effects and processing textures for narrative purposes - and he's never been more in tune with his gifts than he is here.<br /><br />At times, the tone and drama of the dialogue and performances fly at you just as fast as his visuals, with each line and intonation as vital as his visual effects. The extended opening on Krypton is layered with as much philosophy, religious contemplation, and environmental debates as it is with stunning renderings of technology and creatures.<br /><br />Yet, Snyder takes time to slow down when emotion, performances, earthbound reality, and narrative tone demand it. Writer David S. Goyer has structured his screenplay in a fashion similar to \\"Batman Begins,\\" which he co-authored with MAN OF STEEL co-producer and co-story author Christopher Nolan. While Nolan maintained a consistent pace and stylistic approach in \\"Batman Begins,\\" while cross-cutting `timelines' in that film, Snyder utilizes stylistic shifts to allow his visuals to become a visceral extension of Goyer's screenplay structure and dialogue.<br /><br />With regard to the film's performances, the casting could not be more perfect. Henry Cavill embodies his triple roles as Kal-El, Clark Kent and Superman with levels of subtlety, regret, humanity, humor, compassion and - above all - humility. He paces himself in each scene as `evolution' is the key demand of the role. This is really a Clark Kent story, as film reveals to Clark just who he is and who he is destined to be. In the first half, Cavill portrays a Clark Kent expressing loneliness, heroism, determination, and - yes - wit and humor as he wanders the country, struggling with a personal crisis - who am I, and what should I do? Once he discovers his Kryptonian heritage, and identity as Kal-El, he `suits-up' as Superman. Tragically, he must immediately face General Zod and his troops. Cavill is a Superman who has yet to be anointed with that name by the people of earth. Worse, he has yet to gain their trust. For the balance of the film, we witness a Superman learning how to use his powers, protect the people of earth, and realizing you must have faith in people first before trust can be established. It is a lesson he instills on the US military - those who most doubt his insistence he is a loyal American, through and through. By the end of the film, Cavill delivers audiences' expectations of seeing the fully formed Superman and Clark Kent.<br /><br />Amy Adam's Lois Lane is the exact embodiment of what we'd expect from an aggressive, Pulitzer Prize winning reporter. She expresses hard-edged yet beautiful humanity when she stumbles onto the story of the century, only to realize she can't run it as it means ruining a man's life. Michael Shannon brings to Zod a level of depth beyond just rage and vengeance. A key revelation in his character is a tragic one. We learn that he faces fulfilling a destiny he did not choose for himself. As Clark's mother, Diane Lane balances showing concern and fear for her son as his powers emerge and he begins questioning why God made him this way. Lane treats her Kryptonian adopted son as she would any child, hiding her fear and learning how to help her son control his powers. Her goal is that of all mothers - teaching her son that childhood is just a phase of life, not its end.<br /><br />In the Superman saga, the most important parental figures have always been the fathers - Jor-El and Jonathan Kent. It's the casting of Russell Crowe as Jor-El and Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent that illustrate to audiences who Clark is when we meet him, and how he becomes Superman by the end of the film. In Snyder's MAN OF STEEL, it is done better than in any previous cinematic version of the character.<br /><br />Costner's Jonathan Kent is a complex man. Upon learning young Clark has saved a school bus full of his classmates from sinking into a river, Costner is angered. Insisting Clark must keep his powers a secret, when young Clark asks him if he should have let them die, Costner honestly responds, \\"Maybe.\\" He is a father desperate to protect his son from a world he knows is not ready to accept him. A world he fears will turn its mightiest weapons against his son to kill him.<br /><br />Yet, with each flashback featuring Costner's Jonathan Kent, the wisdom he departs deepens, as does the love he has for his son. And Costner's Jonathan Kent imparts unto his son the ultimate example any father who truly believes in principles can - showing your son that you stand behind them at all cost. It's the film's most moving sequence.<br /><br />Russell Crowe's Jor-El is equally full of dimension. Hisrole in the film is not limited to his scenes on Krypton. When Kal-El finally discovers a way to download his father's `consciousness,' Crowe plays the scenes with kindness, reason and - above all - a powerful conviction of faith in his son. Crowe is able to balance acknowledging the burden his son will face as he reveals Kal-El's Kryptonian origins to him, and the awesome responsibility Jor-El as a father is asking of Kal-El as a son to use his powers in becoming an inspiration and symbol of hope for the human race. Like Costner's Jonathan Kent, Crowe inspires confidence in his son by reinforcing principles.<br /><br />There is a sense of consistency in the values of Jonathan Kent and Jor-El as played by Costner and Crowe - a bridged gap that seems almost cosmic. As if the two fathers are at once separate, yet part of a whole.<br /><br />This is not a Superman for those clinging to the Fleischer animated shorts, the Reeves TV series, or the Richard Donner film. And it doesn't need to be. For those longing for those depictions of Superman, they will always exist - wonderfully preserved on Blu-Ray and DVD. MAN OF STEEL does not negate these past incarnations, and it shouldn't. Audiences should always treasure these previous versions of Superman.<br /><br />Yet, the vitriol and anger expressed by critics and some Superman fans against MAN OF STEEL mystifies. The accusation that the last hour of the film is just an over-the-top, empty, bombastic, visual effects laden disaster movie? Not true. There's as much drama, character development and emotion to be found in these scenes as there is in the rest of the film. Furthermore, the film's climax is a `toned down' version of many modern Superman PG-13 animated films, graphic novels and comic book sagas, including the classic 1993 \\"The Death of Superman\\" story.<br /><br />In 2007, the DC Animated Universe division released a direct-to-video film of this story entitled \\"Superman: Doomsday.\\" Rated PG-13, it contained more killings, violence, brutal action sequences, destroyed cities and adult content than MAN OF STEEL - and its running time was only 75 minutes. I can only imagine what critics and many Superman fans would be saying this weekend had Warner Bros. chosen to release that 5 year old animated film instead of MAN OF STEEL.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Just one of the best super-hero movies of the recent era of super hero movies. Iron man is excellent and it is by far the best portrayal of the hulk.
B009EE1GC4|5.0|Last year at the age of 70 I married mybest friend and after the ceremony we decided to go to the show for our honeymoon, seeing The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.  We both laughed and cried with each actor and actress being the one we liked best.  This was a fabulous cast who did an extremely fantastic job in this movie.  So much is about the young now days and it was nice to see that as we age our lives can certainly change in many way.  Loved it so much we bought it and will watch it each year for as long as we have together...

0920236162|5.0|My daughter is 19 and asked for her own copy of this as she didn't want to share the family copy from childhood any longer. She even had fun creatively making a paper bag princess dress to wear for a costume event. As an elementary teacher, my students really enjoy the story also.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great series. Love the sets acting character development, wardrobe and historical accuracy. I have been hearing of the series for a while but did not think I would like it. I was hooked by the the 1st episode of the 1st season!

0770437400|1.0|After the Zombie Survival Guide I was expecting great things.<br />WWZ is awful. Here's a handful of the WORST bits:<br />1) As other reviews state: the characters are one-dimensional and all speak with the same voice, regardless of sex, education or ethnicity.<br />2) The situations are contrived, so-called military strategy and tactics are unrealistic and imply all generals are morons. GRUNTs are morons, generals don't get to be generals because they're idiots, Max.<br />3) Only the Israelis recognised the threat... Really? Jewish born, were you Max? (yes)<br />4) The US saves the world... Again... I'm surprised Michael Bey didn't direct the film!!<br />I could go on. This book is proof sales do not reflect quality. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TURKEY.

B0089LOG02|5.0|This book was hard to put down. I didn't realize it was historical fiction before I started reading. Rich characters and storyline.
B000QY9WOU|2.0|I watched this becuase someone else in the family wanted to see it.  I am not a Cher fan, and disliked this show.
B006IYG5HE|3.0|and then never tied up some glaring loose ends...although that may be done in the next book. Not up to the level of the other two Harry Hole books I have read of Nesbo's.
0451213092|1.0|It's &#34;based on fact&#34; which means parts are fabricated. I guess if you want a novel, then it's okay. If you want a true account, look elsewhere. I returned it.
B009R659L8|4.0|Reads like a classic Mary Higgins Clark story. Enjoyed reading it. Makes a good vacation novel to sit on the beach and read.

B0023SDPS6|5.0|I am always eager to read the next book in this series. They have everything I need to keep me engaged: mystery, suspense, great characters, action, humor, and even a little romance.
B004LQGZ7G|3.0|Interesting at times and parts are enjoyable. Gene Hackman is always a commanding presence. But the film has gotten really dated.

0321714113|5.0|I have 2 or 3 editions of this. It's readable, understandable, and well written. I added this addition to help me learn the newest C++ changes gain Lippman's insights into them. I'll probably get another copy for the office so I don't have to tote it around.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I enjoyed this novel more than his prior 2. I was kept enthralled and certainly had to concentrate in order to hold onto the strands of this very entrncing novel. Just loved it.The writing was superb.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Hello everyone,<br />I have been using this DVD for 6 days now(just started level 2 yesterday)and I decided that it was the perfect time to write a review.<br />I have to say that my first day wasn't easy. I was dead with the warm up and I did just half of the work out. The next day (2nd day) my legs were a little sore but even with that \\"problem\\" I was able to finish the work out and I felt great and really proud. The 3rd day I was really sore and needed a break but I walked for 30 minutes in the morning and 30 at night and went up and down on the stairs few times to keep my body moving. The 4th day I was felling great and did the work out twice ( morning and night), and the days 5 & 6 I started the level 2 and I am doing really good and I am shaking and dead by the end of the exercises because she really kicks your butt. It maybe hard in the beginning for people like me who never did anything like this, but it is easy and Jillian motivates you all the time. She has 2 ladies to help her to show how the exercises should be done. One shows the easy way to do it ( for beginners) and the other one shows the harder way  (advanced). I also got a yoga mat and some weights (You need them to do the exercises). I started with the easy way and I didn't do so well in the beginning but I didn't give up and now I am following the harder way and I am so happy. I have noticed the changes in my body already and you will too. I am doing a diet by eating health in the right times and drinking lots of water and having dinner not later than 6pm . Please eat health so you can see better results. Keep moving! Don't give up! You can do it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A good game for relaxation and quiet challenge. I enjoy playing at bedtime in order to let the tensions of the day melt away.
B00942G4UA|4.0|This is a very informative documentary that needs to be viewed by all of us.  We should put pressure on ogvernment agencies such as the FDA to get the offd industry rigorously inspected.
B0072NWJRK|3.0|The story blends murder and the old society facing the conflict<br />of the Japanese moving into and controlling the country. The<br />old school ways of British detective and the Chinese police.<br />The determination of a father To find out the mystery of his<br />daughters death. A broad picture of the times with a followup<br />of what happen to all main characters. A good read.
1400069289|5.0|I read this book twice, once when it came out, and again these days. I loved it each time.<br /><br />The first time I read it, I just enjoyed it.<br />Beautifully written, lots of interesting stories to illustrate how habits form and how they can be changed, in individuals, organizations and societies.<br /><br />The second time around, I had the opportunity to enjoy the skill of the author.<br />After all, &#34;The Habit Loop&#34; that is at the core of the book is nothing more than the good, old ABC of classic behavioral psychology: Antecedent (here called &#34;cue&#34;), Behavior (here called &#34;routine&#34;), Consequence (here called &#34;reward&#34;).<br />Yet the author, with his engaging writing style and the right choice of stories, succeeds in making this old workhorse of psychology sound new, even flashy.<br />Bravo!<br /><br />If you have not read much about psychology, then this is the book for you - there is a lot to learn, and apply to one's life, in these pages.<br />If you have, or if you are a psychologist, then this is the book for you as well - it will be fun to read and will help you understand how to craft your technical expertise in a way that is highly engaging.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I'm a pilot and I enjoy reading about WW2.  I thought it was a good story and shows their are good people in every country.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|This story of a boy and his friends trying to fight politics... was astounding.  Now, THIS is what I call John Grisham's Theodore Boone!
B000063UR2|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies as a kid. I have always loved the whole magic world filled with elves, unicorns, fairies, goblins and more. Good vs. evil and the balance of life. I still giggle at certain spots and I still enjoy this movie over 20 years later.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Graphics, challenges, make this game fun. The unexpected is what makes it great; fall away paths, jumping flowers. You earn different lands with all new graphics and challenges. What makes this game great,  you can't win or lose just enjoy.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Great costumes, scenery, photography, chemistry between characters, and great story line.  I waited a few years to finally see GOT, and started with the pilot episode.  I'm hooked!
B00BEJOMIW|5.0|I know the critics panned it, but Redford, Dern and Farrow plus  authentic 1920s music made it a favorite of mine!
B007PS0DTI|5.0|This was an awesome flick! Full of action and special effects, as always. A must see, but only after seeing the preceding movies.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Quite challenging and very fun. It kept me entertained on a train ride. It said I couldn't go any further without rating the game though. What's up with that?
B008JFUPK8|3.0|The script and realism of this Superman incarnation was excellent. I was, however, very disappointed in two things: the lackluster 3D which hardly displayed any depth at all, and the overt Christianity exploitation which I've failed to notice in any other superhero movie. I guess if you're not Christian, you haven't got a prayer about Superman saving your heath... butt.
B000FC11A6|5.0|I had never before heard of Neal Stephenson, but he is now one of my favorite authors.  This is a very long, but never boring, story.  It shifts in time and place between: (a) the efforts of American dot.com entrepreneurs to get business in the Philippines, (b) the pre-war (WW II for you youngsters) friendship between American, British and German students who later become codebreakers at Bletchley Park, (c) an American Marine in the Pacific theater, (d) the fascinating mechanics of codebreaking, and (e) other details of the plot which would be spoilers to describe.  Trust me, the author ties them all together.<br /><br />Finally, there is a detailed appendix on how to use a Solitaire Code which only requires a deck of cards with two Jokers and a lot of patience.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|One of the best series ever. Anytime I can't wait for reruns, the presentation is a total winner. The best way to watch any season, is to buy the whole season.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|Great series one of my faves.  Good cast, direction and writing.  Great stars came came out of this series like these of Steele.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is my favorite of all the escape games.  There are clues to help you make educated moves instead of just guessing.  I can't wait for more levels.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is a great for traveling and have no internet.One small con is the updates are so slow! Other than that its a great app for both adults and children
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Must read, I am not a big reader but found that I could not put this book down.  I have already told 10-15 people that they should read as well.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Completely  Addictive Game!  Some of the puzzles are quite simple while others are quite difficult. The game draws you in and keeps you interested. A great way to pass the time.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Someone recommended this show and every show has been good. I would recommend it to anyone who likes court shows.
B008YZ4RR0|5.0|I really like these Tom Selleck movies. They seem to fit his persona and acting skills to a tee. All of them are worth watching in my opinion.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|Damian Stevenson is an expert on Ian Fleming. I have read his screenplays and articles and I was thrilled to learn that he had decided to write an e-book genre book that utilized his knowledge of Fleming's life to tell an old fashioned World War 2 thriller yarn that reads like a cross between a Jason Bourne movie and a BBC costume drama. The combination is interesting. Lots of scenes of characters in tuxedoes sipping cocktails and talking about `Jerry' and `the Bosch' with `old boy' and `I say' sprinkled about liberally - terrific stuff. A bit too much time is devoted to cataloguing who wore what and who ate what but I think it's because this is a first novel. I actually enjoyed all this ephemera because I am a history buff but I can see why some reviewers thought the descriptions were overkill. By far the best parts of this book are the action sequences: the amazing opening flyover surveillance of the French fleet, the parachute drop that goes wrong, the thrilling helicopter attack, the ski chase that nods to `On Her Majesty's Secret Service' but takes it further and of course the obligatory last hurrah climax at the villain's lair - all were first-rate passages, superbly done. In the next book I would like to see more character development, especially with regards Ian Fleming's relationship to Ann O'Neill whom he married in 1953. There were cameos of Peter Fleming, Celia Johnson, Lady Fleming and Noel Coward, who was alluded to. I hope we see these characters take more of a role in future books. This story is set in 1940, which gives author Stevenson a lot of time to play with. One wonders where the series will go from here. The research must have taken forever. I hope we don't have to wait too long for the next installment which the liner notes in this book tells us is called `The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Trinity.\\"
141694737X|5.0|My 16 months old son loves this book.  We have been reading it everyday since we got it.  He likes to lift and look at the animals.
B009AMAGQM|5.0|I fell in love with the book and when they decided to make a movie from it i was very excited. Im so pleased and happy too say that this is an amazing movie. I cannot wait for the next movie to come out!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie does an excellent job of providing the historic context of the action involved.  And the choice of actors and humor are perfect.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|Downton Abbey is by far one of the best series I've ever watched.  We watched season 1 and 2 on On Demand on our tv, but when season 3 was not available, we'd hoped to be able to stream it to the tv using amazon video.  We were disappointed to discover we could not.  Watching on the small iPad screen just doesn't work, though we did try watching episode 1 of season 3.  So we will have to wait until it becomes available either through On Demand or Netflix to finish watching.  But we love the series, and I'm sure season 3 will not be a disappointment.  The writing, the acting, the scenery are all superb.  But this review is of amazon video more than Downton Abbey.  Hopefully in the future we will be able to stream amazon video onto the tv.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|I really like these Tom Selleck movies. They seem to fit his persona and acting skills to a tee. All of them are worth watching in my opinion.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|The entire book is a collection of stories that are chronologically organized to give you a picture of the zombie outbreak as a whole, throughout the entire world.  This reads more like a history book with a few expletives thrown into it. It will be interesting to see what kind of creative liberties the movies takes with this, as it is hard to see how they could make a movie out of this, with one main character that is.  Bottom line, you can keep it and I regret paying $10 for it. Not even worth that.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|What a great movie. I love how the Marvel characters are brought together. Let's hope there will be more Avengers movies to come
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Hannibal is creepy, horrific and cringe-worthy! I. Love. It! I identified with Will Graham instantaneously, and Hannibal Lector keeps you cringing, he's just so creepy!
B009NY43NY|4.0|It was a quick read full of the touches that I enjoyed from Mrs. Harris's other Sookie books. I wish there had been more depth to the end of her relationships with the vampire world and more closure on other beloved characters, but for the most part, I felt it was a good closure to the series.
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|Very slow moving with no real plot at all.  The graphics are not enough to save this lame movie.<br />I do not recommend it.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|Hitchcock and Grant. What else is there to say? The classic just gets better with age in comparison to the junk produced today.
B005LAIIMG|3.0|Crazy run you down and bite you zombies - check!<br /><br />....and that's about it.<br /><br />No real cool fight scenes.  No real characters that were interesting or memorable (who cared if any of them bit the farm).  A spotty plot that jerks around and doesn't really create any tension or excitement.  Inaccurate portrayal of the world of aviation, the military, and science (labs/infectious diseases) which makes the whole thing just painful to watch for anyone with even a casual familiarity of any of them.  Normally you could just sort of ignore it and enjoy your popcorn but they constantly held it up for close inspection letting you know exactly how little of a clue the director/producer had.<br /><br />All and all a rental and a big letdown considering how good the books was.
159463176X|5.0|A superior, engaging story that draws readers in and satisfies throughout.  Highly recommended.  I have several people in line to borrow the book already.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I like the game but it takes to long to earn money to buy things. Leveling up is easy, but I guess it has to be because of the amount of levels you need to unlock items. But other than that it's one of the coolest free games on a tablet.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Good Book.  I've read all of Reichs' &#34;Bones&#34; books, and have enjoyed them all.  A word of caution to those unfamiliar, and who might be expecting the stories from the TV show...  Fuggedaboutit!  The Books bear very little resemblence to the TV 'Bones' character, and none of the TV show accoutrements, like 'The Jeffersonian', Booth, Brennan's father, The Jeffersonian crew, etc. exist in the books - they are a completely different world.
B001GMQALY|3.0|Good movie for it's type.  A bit depressing but works out in the end.  Kim is worth watching.<br />Enjoy it.
B000P0J0D8|1.0|The story is veeery sloooow and boring...<br /><br />Good for a nap. Don't waste your time.<br /><br />I suggest you spend 2 hours of your life watching some other movie.<br /><br />For a really good \\"True Romance\\" movie, check out \\"Train Man : Densha Otoko\\".
B004EPYZU8|3.0|The girls are attractive, but the movie is strange.  It seems to be all in her imagination.  She was in a hospital, and she pretty much imagines or dreams up the whole thing.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|A truly challenging version of bingo, playing live against real people adds to the addiction and requires strategy. Best bingo game I've found!
