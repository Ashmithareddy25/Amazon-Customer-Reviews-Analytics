B00AB7HESI|5.0|I had the DS version, but this one is much better if you ask me.<br />Its a great game and you should get it.
B00E5Q1LTY|1.0|I went to see this movie in theaters. I was Extremely disgusted and disappointed.<br /><br />1. J.J. Abrahms had said that he wasn't going copy anything of the storyline of the older movies, that is all the last 30 minutes of this movie did. And did very poorly i thought, as an old school star trek fan some one who has seen every episode and every movie, i found that extremely distasteful. I was almost just a bad remake almost to the point of being a parody of the original wrath of kahn.<br /><br />2. The special effects were great. That being said, i think the were the best part of the movie.<br /><br />3. The actors did a good job, but i think the script was poorly written, or at least the plot was.<br /><br />I will never buy this movie, i did see it a second time when someone took me(I was glad i didn't pay for the ticket the second time). It was worse the second time than the first for me therefore, i won't waste my money on something that i didn't like. I really wish he had took this movie into a whole new direction it would have been a lot better.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love minecraft and all the buliding, and this is fun on the go<br />But it is kinda &quot;off&quot; but there fixing the game up to be AWESOME
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|I purchased this game expecting to just try it out and I ended up losing track of time.  The kindle tablet version is different than the normal PC version in that you have things you can buy from a shop and there are also heroes you can command.  I would definitely recommend this game to any fans of strategy tower defense games
B007THA4FI|1.0|Bleh...  Quit on it. Hated the characters and pretty much everything about it. Might finish it if I have nothing else to read.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A rebellious teen (Hazel) struggles with some of the harsh realities of life, dealing with cancer, love, relationships, and wondering what life is all about; and, by the way, where do you go when you die?  The questions that humans have pondered since the beginning of civilization.<br /><br />All Hazel (and we) can ever get is a glimpse of the truth from the Arts - the writers of poetry, song and literature, painters and sculptors, and from some place deep within ourselves.  And still the truth about reality remains forever beyond our ability to fully grasp.  And to Hazel, the world has too many  people who say they know the truth, think they know the truth, but are charlatans, full of lovely but empty words.<br /><br />Ultimately Hazel can only find peace in the acceptance of undeniable fate, and that life will always remain a mystery to be experienced rather than a problem to be solved.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Love my Kindle Fire cover! It's not bulky, yet gives plenty of protection for my needs. The price was great. The only thing negative is that getting it to stand/propped up is a little tricky and must be in just the right spot (the groove on the back). I usually hold it in my hands so no problem for me.
B008MEM24S|4.0|If you have played \\"Where's my water?\\", you have played this game.  That is not necessarily a bad thing.  The two games are variations on a theme, so you know exactly what you are getting.
B000VEA38E|5.0|I'm a big Star Wars fan and love the music. I was happy to find this collection, and at a good price.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The most fun I've had reading in ages. Can't wait to download her earlier novels and see what else she has knocking around that twisted mind of hers.
0345529057|5.0|I would have never guessed that I would like to read a story about kings until a friend gave me the 1st book, I finished it in 3 days time and ordered the whole series.  George R.R. Martin describes the characters in such detail you feel as you know them.  I recommend this series to every reader out there!
B007SXB498|5.0|One of Austin's best novels very heart rending and touching . Great characters and insight into their hearts and actions
B004VMUS9G|5.0|A workhorse. Love the stardard alarm sound choices. Caffeinated rattlesnake rocks!!! I really wish reviews were character - count based....
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Love the app. I don't need to wear my glasses to see the numbers. I have had no trouble with it so far.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|The publisher sent me a copy of this book before release, but it landed on a pile of other unread books at the time, and I forgot about it.  Colleagues had mentioned the book to me a couple times during discussions about virtual reality in the last couple years, but I usually worry a bit about reading fiction that involves technology that I am too close to, for fear that qualms about the tech will distract me too much.<br /><br />It turns out that, while I could still pick a few nits with it, the book isn't about technology, and I could easily accept the setting.  The book is really about the culture that shaped many of the people that are shaping the technology that will lead to the setting in the book.  I don't usually think of myself as sentimental or nostalgic, but it was striking how many formative elements of my youth were referenced in the book, and the fond memories that they pulled up.<br /><br />The parts of the book that are basically game play narrative didn't do much for me, but overall, I had a great time reading the book.  The prose is better than most first books, and everything is so heartfelt that you forgive any bits of roughness.  If you are a geek in your 30s or 40s, you will probably love it.<br /><br />After finishing the book, I had to go watch an episode of Max Headroom inside a VR headset.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|This just a plain old dictionary nothing special or fancy but considering how it's a book  you can't like search for a word or. Anything
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|There are so many movie versions of Jane Austen's books, and most are not worth the time to watch.  The screenwriters seem to think they need to add &#34;sex, drugs, and rock and roll&#34; to the story for a modern audience.  There are plenty such modern stories out there.  It is not Jane Austen's 1812 story when such changes are made.<br /><br />This 1995 BBC production of &#34;Persuasion&#34; is faithful to the book (what a concept!), and the casting and the performances are perfect.  The dialogue is exactly from the book with new dialogue based on descriptions in the book for those scenes necessary to a screen production of a book. The settings and the costumes are appropriate to 1812 England.  The storyline is the one Jane<br />Austen wrote, and the characters are portrayed as Austen wrote them.  Overall, a beautiful production.
B000002BYA|4.0|The first half is worth the price of admission, the second half is tolerable.  Hearing anything live by SRV is a gift to the soul.
B004132I20|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite shows. Okay, so I'm a Sherlock Holmes fan anyway. I like Elementary too, but for different reasons. I can't wait for season three.
B008PZZV8S|5.0|Makes you want to travel.<br />Matt Damon and Jude law act their pants off. Gweneth Paltrow, Kate Blanchett and Philip Seymour-Hoffman are Gods.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite shows. Okay, so I'm a Sherlock Holmes fan anyway. I like Elementary too, but for different reasons. I can't wait for season three.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not for those who frustrate easily.  A great game of deduction.  I love it.  Great entertainment patience required!  NO INSTRUCTIONS REQUIRED what would you do to escape?
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|What a cast! How can you not love any movie where Helen Mirren is an assasin?!?! This is definitely not the best movie of all time, nor is it my all-time favorite, but darn it's FUN and entertaining. Just relax and enjoy. Oh and pass the popcorn.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like this app.  Love  playing this game while waiting on something else to happen,, like a doctor. Great Little time passer.
0452295548|5.0|My 90 year old, very healthy mother in law had a massive stroke and this has been an excellent guide to assist her back. Wish I would have taken the time to read this sooner.
078401213X|5.0|This movie is a classic as much as a cult classic. Very well filmed (if you don't mind the artsy B&W w/ grain look.) The story is great and the movie flows well. A movie to be watched for sure.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|Very entertaining, kept me interested and guessing till the end. I love Morgan Freeman and as always his movies never disappoint.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|The vintage tagline for &#34;Star Trek&#34;...&#34;to bravely go where no man has gone before&#34;; could well have been rewritten for this 12th feature length film in the franchise as...&#34;to bravely go where no Star Trek has gone before.&#34; This movie takes the &#34;Star Trek&#34; franchise a warp or two farther along the universe of excellence...it is in my opinion the best in the franchise so far. There is plenty of the sci/fi action we've come to expect and stunning special effects from Industrial Light and Magic; but this one also features an outstanding story; excellent dramatization; superb acting and the best villain - my opinion again - of any &#34;Star Trek&#34; film. Benedict Cumberbatch, as the villain with the familiar name of Khan, delivers a truly memorable and possibly career defining performance. Other standouts include Chris Pine reprising his role as Captain Kirk, from the 2009 film; Zachary Quinto as Spock; and Zoe Saldana as Uhura. Leonard Nimoy makes a cameo appearance as Spock Prime. Newcomer Alice Eve also does well as Science Officer, Carol Wallace. If you are a Trekkie or just a fan of good sci/fi actioners, I think you'll love it.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I am watching this show made in 2002 today.  Everything still holds current except for the cell phones!  This show could be on prime time today and be a big hit.<br /><br />The acting is fantastic and the story lines are good.  Thank you Amazon Prime for making this show available.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I don't watch much television; but I started watching this w/my wife after she got hooked. Now I am hooked too; in fact I like it as well or better - leaning more toward better - than any other crime drama series I've ever watched. It is now the #1 ranked TV show, which is no surprise. I've watched every season prior to this; just finished watching this one, and I have nothing but praise...from the stories, to the casting, to the snappy and often funny dialogue. And Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) is the best team chief ever in a crime drama. Nothing but praise and my highest recommendation!!
0446613444|5.0|The book was in great shape and for 4.00 which included postage it was a bargin.<br />It was a bit slow in arriving as they use book rates, which are cheaper, and  that is fine.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Say what you will about Tom Cruise - and of his off-screen persona, most of what I'd have to say would be negative - but he is a great actor, who almost always delivers; and this is one of his best performances. This is a thinking man's science fiction flick...not only is it visually stunning with some nifty CGI special effects, it also has an intelligently written script, with dialogue that is ofttimes poetic, as the opening quote exemplifies. Set in 2077, 60 years after Earth is invaded by alien beings called Scavengers (Scavs), who destroy the Moon, resulting in a tectonic upheaval, that - combined with nuclear weapons, used to defeat the aliens, have resulted in Earth becoming virtually uninhabitable. The remaining humans inhabit a huge space station and have established a colony on Titan, one of the moons of Saturn. Cruise as Jack Harper, is Tech 49, who is responsible for patrolling the radiation-free sections of Earth and for maintenance of drone warships that hunt down the remaining Scavs. He is assisted by his communications officer and lover, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough). At the end of one of his patrols, the Odyssey, a NASA spaceship crashes and in the only survivor is a mysterious female, Julia (Olga Kurylenko). But things are not exactly as they seem. Be prepared for some surprises, beginning with the appearance Julia and Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman) who leads an underground stronghold of...humans. Produced, directed and written by Joseph Kosinski, he gets triple credit for its excellence. If you love the genre as much as I do, you will love this outstanding sci/fi flick.
B00D6M86RS|3.0|Not bad, overall, but I wonder if the designers are trying to put too much content in the small screen of an Android device. I have a Kindle Fire HD (7) and at that size the graphics are too busy.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Amazingly this four hour plus film (although intended as a TV mini-series) was released theatrically by Ted Turner and did fairly well; earning 10M toward its 25M production costs. But it has become one of the most popular films on cable TV and in VHS and DVD format, more than earning its keep. This adaptation of Michael Shaara's &#34;The Killer Angels&#34; along with the adaptation of Jeff Shaara's prequel, &#34;Gods and Generals&#34;, are in my opinion the two best theatrical films on the Civil War...especially true if you're a history buff. While Michael Shaara's account of Gettysburg is fictionalized, it is really only the dialogue that is fictional...the account in the book of the three day battle (and in this film) is accurate in all its salient points. Col John Buford (Sam Elliot) did hold the Federal line during the first day of battle; Col Joshua Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels) did hold the Union left flank on the second day and did use the &#34;wheel maneuver&#34; to defeat the Confederate attackers. The famous Confederate cavalry general, J. E. B. Stuart, was a no-show, leaving Lee (Martin Sheen) strategically blind. Lt Gen James &#34;Pete&#34; Longstreet (Tom Berenger) did strongly recommend a flanking maneuver to get between Union forces and Washington and was strongly against the third day's battle, that came to be known as &#34;Pickett's Charge&#34;. The Confederate general, Lewis &#34;Lo&#34; Armistead (Richard Jordan) and the Union general, Winfield Scot Hancock (Brian Mallon) were close friends. The acting by the entire cast is uniformly good, but the performances by Berenger, Daniels, Elliot, and Richard Jordan stand out. This was Jordan's last film as he died of a brain tumor before it was released. If you're a student of the Civil War, and especially the Battle of Gettysburg, you will want to add this one to your film library. My highest recommendation.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is totally addicting. I could play it all day. Honestly it makes me feel great every time i accomplish something ha ha.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Good movie - but you should see Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America movies before you watch this one so you will completely enjoy it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i play this game several times a day its fun when your at the doctors you have something to do to past the time
B001AQO3QA|5.0|What can I say about the Alien Anthology???  It's awesome.  Got an incredible deal through Amazon for this great blu-ray set.  These blu-ray editions really bring the movies back to life.  The bonus features are awesome.  The Alien 3 &#34;making of&#34; featurette was supurb. To be fair, all of the making-of featurettes are great.  However, Alien Resurrection still sucks...but the other 3 more than make up for the one dud.
B000JMKTLO|1.0|This is the second book I've read by this seemingly talented author that made me feel \\"dirty by association\\" after reading.  It appears to me that she has set out to deliberately go against the popular trend to create characters that the reader will like and identify with.  OK, I can accept that.  But for me the characters are just too extreme and just so very damaged it defies belief (or certainly involvement in their story).  It's just not practical or believable and for myself as a reader, impossible to continue to suspend disbelief all the way to the end.  And all those plot twists and surprises - not so much.  Once you've established each and every character as completely flawed, their actions cease to surprise.  Unless and until I read a review of the next book that indicates she's taken a very different approach to a story and characterizations, I won't be spending time reading this author again.  The one star is acknowledgement that the books are, for the most part, well written (with the exception of some pacing issues covered in other reviews).
0316286850|5.0|Background: Although I'm 34 y/o, I've never been a full makeup girl and so have mostly stick to the basics (eyeliner, mascara, lipstick, blush), but as I've grown older I've needed more help with coverage, sun spots, dark circles etc- and so in the last few years have ventured into more options (concealer, TMs, highlighters) to help my face look more even. Ive also slowly developed a new-found love and respect for makeup generally, and its power to give us that 'pick-me-up' feeling in minutes.<br /><br />Having said that, eye makeup was never my strong point but I still loved what other women can do with their eye makeup, and wanted to learn some tricks beyond the basics. SO I originally decided to pick up the Bobbi Brown Makeup Manual because I love her makeup formulas and I always find something to suit my hard-to-match olive skin tone.  BUT even as a beginner I was so disappointed with how basic it was,  giving a general overview of makeup with little technique to applying it. I returned it and picked up Kevyn's 'Making Faces'....<br /><br />AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.<br /><br />The step-by-step instructions of applying your makeup are not that detailed and the drawings instead of pics don't necessarily help, but Kevyn's encouraging writing style and free spirit alone gives you the confidence to try the looks and re-interpret them in any way, color, modern style you want. The looks are not complicated, but they are ABSOLUTELY CLASSIC and will look great throughout the ages (minus the the few very 90s lined lips). A testimony to the book, was my hubs (not a man of many words) telling me I looked 'gorgeous' after trying out one of the looks.  Kevyn also stresses the importance of keeping your base makeup natural looking, which is definitely my philosophy.<br /><br />This is absolutely a beautiful and useful book to get started and feel confident wearing makeup at any age. The photos alone are inspirational. Definitely worth picking up.
B0063IH60K|5.0|awesome cap. I love. the fact I can player with others. love playing against the clock. Really nest that it can show u how to win as well
0446581356|3.0|Let me start by saying I love Bobbi's makeup line, and Im a firm believer in her knowledge and expertise- I love her foundations, gel liner, brushes and lipsticks, her line really suits my olive skin tone...but this book was a real disappointment. I wanted to learn more techniques to applying makeup (the concealer section was the best) but I found it just gave a very VERY general overview of makeup, and had a lot of emphasis on making it into the as a MUA. I think it would be a great book for a young teen to learn the basics of what's what, but if you're looking to learn new techniques, eye looks, and brush-up on your application skills, definitely look elsewhere.<br /><br />I'm not an 'out there' makeup person, and my eye makeup is pretty simple and neutral for the most part- yet I still found this uninspiring. I picked up Kevyn Aucoin's 'Making Faces' instead and found it A LOT more helpful and very encouraging , gave me more confidence to try some more dramatic but still very wearable looks. Unfortunately I returned Bobbi's Makeup Manual.
B000028U0Y|5.0|This album is great!  It is filled with music that stirs the soul.  Makes you want to sing along.<br /><br />Included in this album is June Carter Cash as well as the finale written by a Folsom Prison inmate.
B00785P2QC|4.0|its ok I really hate. how much butt. you have to kiss to get the investment papers though I wish there is a better way too get them without. having to use rl money
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Absolutely love this book. From the first page the author draws you in with the ideas being narrated from a &#34;dog's perspective&#34;. The story line, mixed with the dog's humorous points and quips is just a highlight to the message behind the story. Absolute MUST READ!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|wish it had more series, enjoyed it tremendeously, all the actors were magnificent. would recommend it to friends and family
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Great músic, voices and characters!!!<br />Super entertaining! Can't wait to see 2nd season here because cant see the whole season online with the network
B00AC8ZIXO|5.0|Builds from the beginning and keeps getting more and more intense.  By the time it ends This movie manages to become quite memorable.  I can't believe that anyone would grant it anything less than 4 stars.  I've never even played any of the games, and I consider myself pretty picky when it comes to saying a movie is flat out memorable, and this movie actually moved me at the same time that the effects were pretty dazzling.  Very well done.  Good enough for me to buy it now that I've seen it.  I very much liked the affiliation with ancient Roman gravitas.  Great story, great effects, and a fair degree of great acting. Master Chief is utterly memorable.  For me, if a movie sticks with me for a few days after having seen it, it is because it has some kind of magic to it.  Well, this movie has magic to it.  I sure hope they make more of these.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love love love!!! I love this series. Fun to watch over and over. I can't wait for season 4 to start!!
B0015DROBO|5.0|I knew it would be a page turner. I had seen two of the movies. I already loved the heroine. I knew it was a feminist work. I had  no idea that the author had a huge political history in fighting racist ideas, and that history informs every page. It continues to amaze me that this very political and progressive work has been a number one best seller for years. But the story is so gripping, it shouldn't have surprised me.
B00395ZYVS|3.0|But...I just would have loved it to be somewhat less predictable. Somehow everything got tied up in a nice neat package. I would have enjoyed something that would have required more thought.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|I have come to really love Tom Cruise ans an actor. He is down to Earth and not all about himself.<br />I have been surprised over and over again to love his professionalism and leave all the other parts of himself behind and really just deliver his character in the movie he plays for.<br />Again, having the Kindle HD quality to view the movies on is a whole enjoyable experience in itself. This time I downloaded it which eneabled me to watch it in places I may not have had WiFi connection on.
B00338QENI|4.0|This book was one of our book club selections and I would not have picked it independently to read.  Being an African American, reading books about slavery, often makes me angry and depressed.  Reading for me is a source of fun and enjoyment. While there was the usual depressing and painful story that goes along with this type of book, I felt this book had a lot more to offer.  It was a powerful story about the power of knowledge and skill.  How ones abilities and competency can opened doors and give you a form of power and value.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Just when I though I had it figured it out, everything turned another direction.  It kept me on the edge of my seat.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is amazing! On one hand it has that old fashioned dystopia feel but in a modern delivery. It is just a very interesting world and a compelling story that is consistent and somehow epic.<br />No longer the struggling writer, you have arrived! Read Wool you will not be disappointed.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|Has great action and comedy. Plus a twist that you never see coming, made me want more. Great actors and dialog.
B002U3CCKQ|4.0|Although &#34;Dark Places&#34; isn't as good as Gillian Flynn's &#34;Gone Girl&#34;, it's still a fine novel, very dark with a plethora of scurvy characters.  The interplay of various voices is superb as is the resolution.  It's difficult to have a novel with such  an unpleasant protagonist, but her development is credible and the control of character and narrative is impressive.
0547391005|5.0|My niece and her husband were very touched with this book for their daugther's birthday.  They had family menbers write a  note in the front of the book, as they plan to save it for future generations.  The book was hardcover, and very complete.  I see another customer commented on the binding not holding up, but time will tell if it does.
B00DBISUWS|5.0|For anyone pining for the glorious down-tempo ambiance of Goldfrapp's first masterpiece, Felt Mountain, Tales of Us isn't quite the same.  But it's close.  It's a (mostly) stripped-down acoustical affair like Seventh Tree, but moodier like Felt Mountain.<br /><br />Tales of Us is certainly nothing like 70-esque electro-glam of Black Cherry and Supernature many Goldfrapp fans are familiar with.  For the record, I adore both those albums as well (ie, I'm no jaded Felt Mountain blowhard).  But long time Goldfrapp fans should embrace Will and Alison's return to down-tempo, especially after the (IMHO) dreadful 80s experimentation with Head First.  Alison's voice simply doesn't lend itself to 80s pop.  It works for electro-glam.  But there's no voice more perfectly suited for melancholy.  Welcome home, Goldfrapp.
B009RX85N0|5.0|I love Once Upon a Time. The movies are great and the disk are in perfect condition. The quality of the movie is good
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Be prepared to fall in love with this book and its characters.  The story line is well written I have continued to<br />Laugh, cry, greave, and feel anger, as well as love and great passion.  Get ready for sleepless night as you may not be able to put this book down.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Entertaining movie for the most part. Fast paced and kept you guessing. But the last 15 minutes dragged on and unfortunately the ending was too predictable.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|great graphics. super cute game. only negative is the game froze. I will try again and hopefully. it doesn't do it every time
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Loved it!  Am a Star Trek fan and they did a great job with developing the characters and their back stories. Wonderful way to reboot the franchise so that the crew can go on new adventures now while also paying homage to the past.  Had to have for my collection
B00DJUPLY8|3.0|can u listen to omd.com files on this..having hardtime finding something that does work for using listening to these on this app
B00932A4XE|4.0|Light comedy with several couples facing different challenges in the pregnancy experience.  It was a fun light movie to watch.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Its a pretty good movie. Its not a great movie but it definitely will entertain you. It got some good action and somewhat OK story line.
B003ZJ70W4|3.0|It was ok but I like the first one much better I rate that 4 stars. Wouldn't watch this one as much
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|If you like science fiction, you will like this movie. its got great story and plots. Tom cruise delivers again.
B0045KS6M0|5.0|Loved this movie first time I saw it and still love it, story line is great. Would have to say I did like Richard Gere in this one the best. And Jodi Foster is awesome in it, I highly recommend it, rent it or better yet buy it you won't be sorry.
B00ACKU1NY|1.0|This app did not work for me at all.  Nothing worked at all.  I wouldn't suggest that you try it.
B0054SMID0|5.0|I really like this movie didn't really think I would but it is excellent not to mention it has Matthew McConaughey
0399165274|3.0|Forsyth has fallen down as of late.  His thrillers do not thrill.  At least this book is fighting terrorists, so it does have some action.<br />He has had a bit of sales problems as of late as a great deal of the English reading audience is American and he has gone out of his way to express his contempt for Americans in some of his books, especially the more recent ones.  For this reason, he creates a rather two dimensional American character called \\"the Tracker\\". Then the rest of the action is this guy interacting with British spy services and a British SAS unit.  Pretty weak.<br />Still is you have nothing better to read, this is an OK \\"get the bad guy novel\\".  However, you will probably fall asleep a few times before the end.  It's certainly not \\"edge of your seat\\" action.
B00E97AZZK|5.0|This movie was beyond delightful. It actually managed to surprise me with the plot twist. They did an fantastic job with the cast and performance. It's rare to start a movies and not know how it will end in the first five minuets these days. Because the writing is predictable and they tell the same story from the same voice often in movies, but  this movie breaks out of the mold. Bravo, Bravo!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Awesome story telling with an even better ending!<br />A must read!  The author of What Alice Forgot does it again.<br />I anxiously await her next novel.
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|I thought the second installment sucked , but this one was fantastic. I was pleasantly shocked. I can watch this again, which makes it a winner in my books.
B002WWKZJK|5.0|Lord Rule was to marry Elizabeth, but she was in love with an Army Lieutenant.  Elizabeth's youngest sister, Horatia, goes to Lord Rule and offers herself as a substitute bride.  Lord Rule instantly likes Horatia and agrees to marry her, since he was only getting married to produce an Heir.  This is a sweet love story. It kept my attention and has many twists and turns.  I am particularly fond of Lord Rule for his correct and humorous speech throughout the story.  I highly recommend this book.  It is one of my favorite novels by Georgette Heyer so far.
B009CG233U|4.0|I love the books and the movies do the books justice. Overall, the acting is good. I just like this movie for a night of ice cream and snuggling on the couch in blankets. It displays the beauty of a messy life.
B009ZQC7MY|2.0|From historical drama to hysterical melodrama -- this show has gone down hill. I might watch season four if I have nothing else to do, which is highly unlikely.<br /><br />I have loved this series. I loved the way they followed history, depicted social change, and illustratde the beauty and responsibility of an old and now outdated way of life. But this bit about killing off a major figure every time a child is born is lazy and melodramatic. When Sybil died, it reflected medical issues with child birth and clinging to the old ways -- it represented the high mortality rate that was a reality in those times. However, this death didn't represent anything. It was melodrama at its worst. The story line of changing from one form of financial management to another was a good one but unnecessary deaths not related to history was gratuitous at best, and left a bad taste in my mouth.
B009EEKPWQ|5.0|Great character portrayal by each actor. There was not one actor phoning in their performance. It's another one of my snuggle up and watch with ice cream or popcorn movie favorites.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|If you're a fan of Stargate:SG1, you should definitely check out Stargate:Atlantis.  Season 1 obviously sets up story lines for future episodes and seasons, and there's a lot of good stuff down the line.  You'll see a few crossover episodes as well as character crossovers.  That doesn't happen in Season 1, but everything in Season 1 leads up to it.  5 stars.
B00BI5J9BC|4.0|I love a good musical. You know something is well written with great character development if you worry about the characters after the credits roll.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|First, the performers are quite good, both their voices and their acting.  Second, there are some surprises in this production that are very interesting - primarily, that the attitudes of Raul (the Vicomte) and Meg Geary (the daughter of Ms Geary who rescued the Phantom from his captivity) have changed drastically from 'Phantom'; I guess time makes changes in all our characters, and you will have to accept that in order to enjoy this whole thing.  I did enjoy it; it is good, but not great as is the original 'Phantom' (what could be??).  Webber is still a marvelous composer, and although there is a different lyricist for this show, the music and the songs are very good.  If you liked (or as I did, loved) 'Phantom', you would do well to try this one - especially at the excellent price.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Yes would recommend this show. Love the cast and the story line. A must view for the entire family. :)
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|The original Judge Dredd movie was pretty goofy, but that was what they did with movies based on comics way back in the '90's.  It wasn't an awesome movie, but it accomplished it's goal; lots of cool (if campy) futuristic action with an uber tough good guy.  I have some fond memories of the movie, but it wasn't one of my favorites.<br /><br />The same can be said of the new version as well.  Some nice action scenes, a couple of decent one-liners, and a bunch of blood.  I gave the movie 4 stars basically because it exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />My expectations were pretty low.

B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|This is a year that I've been learning photography, and I really love macro shots, but I don't have a budget for a full lens.  I participate in a project online for photography and I saw someone's shots that had me asking her where she got her lens and to my surprise, she mentioned she only had a \\"clip.\\"  I bought it and since then, I have been in love.  For one, it's super easy to clip on and off (I take a lot of bug and bird shots, so I can easily move from one area to the next with the clip!).  It takes time to learn how to move, hold breath, and get a good focused shot, but there are also mounts on the tripod for this very thing if needed (I always opt for handheld, though).  Image quality does not suffer for the amateur like myself.  I went on a photo shoot with friends and we handed the clip around when taking shots.  It's truly universal.  It works on my zoom too, so don't be afraid to push its limits.  For the money, an excellent find.  For those learning, it's a gem.
B0098QBEXO|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in years.  The acting was amazing, as was the cinematography, the location and the script was perfect. Beautifully done. I would highly recommend it.
B0048KXRR6|5.0|by myself or with children/our grandchildsons when DVR recorded. Good moral lessons for all ages. So I purchased it to keep in my video library next to Nanny McPhee and have a McPhee marathon one of these days...just because.<br /><br />Apparently it came with video on demand through Amazon. Don't know if I'll ever view it that way as a bigger screen, surround sound and comfortable chair is more enjoyable.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|This had so much going on and just no horror at all. A waste of rental money. I was expecting better.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I just don't get all the hype of this series.  I didn't find it shocking or pornographic.  My complaint with this book is the writing.  The author uses many phrases repetitively, and plot line lags.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great show with lots of twist and turns. The characters really make the show. Each episode keeps you on your seat  with unexpected turn of events. One down for the show is that season 3 costs money with a PRIME Membership. Seasons 1 and 2 are included in the PRIME membership. Need to wait till season 4 starts and hopefully Season 3 will be included in the PRIME membership
B00DFBVKCS|5.0|Fabulous tribute to a few of the Kings of Bakersfield, Buck and Merle weren't the only one's championing the California style. It's important to remeber that this style was shunned by Nashville at the time, but much like the &#34;outlaw movement&#34; they ignored Nashville conventionality and did it their way, in California of all places! Country music fans spoke with their pocketbooks and Nashville had no choice but to listen. Vince & co. do it justice.
B002HTWYZ6|5.0|A highly regarded performance and a great entry point for anyone yet to get to know Oscar Peterson. The K2HD mastering elevates the already excellent recording significantly vs. the standard CD. Highly recommended

B0089LOG02|5.0|Before any governmental safety nets, between 1840 and 1920 there were apparently about 10,000 children - small children -- living by their wits on the streets of New York at any given time.  Private charities had them rounded up and shipped by train to the Midwest, in the hope that families needing a farmhand would take them in. Some were adopted and did well.  Some were abused, exploited, and enslaved. There were few resources for supervision.  My family is still arguing about whether it would have been better to leave them in New York.  This book is fiction, but it presents a good, ground-level view of what happened to kids on the orphan trains.

0812982622|1.0|This is a novel about North Korea and there's cruelty, suffering. blood, tragedy, torture, duplicity and inhumanity on nearly every page<br /><br /> To start off with Pak Jun Do is born in an orphanage, but he's not an orphan.  He had a father and mother, but like so many characters in this novel do , mother has vanished unaccountably. Dad, however,  is Master of the orphans; and his job is to run the orphanage and then assign out to the agencies which need child labor (mines, factories. prisons and the like). the numbers of orphans requested. Because he doesn't want to seem to be playing favorites, Dad treats Jun Do with more cruelty than he treats the orphans. So in the first 25 pages of this long, long novel you have an absence of love, isolation, inhumanity, brutality - and it goes down hill from there. Jun Do and his \\"friends\\" inhabit a world which makes Dante's walk through Hell with the poet Virgil (The Inferno) look like a walk in the park.<br /><br /> Actually, the first 100 pages of this novel are pretty straight forward story telling -  Jun Do's \\"orphaned\\" upbringing, Jun Do's work as part of a team kidnapping specified South Koreans and others for North Korean industry. His promotion and his education in English. His training. His assignment to an old fishing boat where, cramped in the cold steel bowels of the boat, in a compartment lit only by the dull green glow of his equipment, he monitored without relief the electronic transmissions of all senders (particularly the Americans) across nearly all wave lengths twelve hours a night every night seven days a week.  Hiss good, his very human relationship with the  Captain, the first Mate, and the Second Mate, and the sea and the fishing itself.<br /><br /> Then the plot starts to get complicated and goes off the rails. There are the transmissions from the two American women rowing around the world. They row in twelve hour shifts; and Jun Do is \\"in love\\" with the night rower.<br /><br /> And then - more plotcomplications -  there's the Sun Moon thing:  She's the flower of North Korean cinema who was married to Commander Ga, the epitome of North Korean cowboy culture, and who in some hopelessly confusing  pages becomes entangled with our friend Jun Do.<br /><br /> Finally - and in what could have been the funniest mismatch of North Korean stupidity and Texas sophistication in all literature -  Jun Do is part of a delegation of three North Korean officials (The Minister. Comrade Buc and Doctor Song) who fly in an ancient Ilyushin  to the Texas ranch of \\"The Senator\\" and his wife and Wanda (an American intelligence agent) where they have a Texas BBQ - but it just doesn't come off right. It's not that funny as written and it certainly isn't up to  the  literary quality expected from a Pulitzer Prize Winner.<br /><br /> Up until page 180 in my paperback copy the story has been a kind of literary slide show,  with a few pages of well written prose - tragic or ridiculous - sliding past the readers view without any conceivable literary connection with each other save for the names of the characters.<br /><br />But now it changes. And it is a year later. And we're listening to a character tell us about the  between  two methods of torture used to reduce a man (or woman) to the vegetable, obedient worker the North Korean state would like all citizens to be. One method involves pain waves via electricity and a metal halo attached to the head, the other a \\"pain machine\\" of come kind which is more \\"humane\\" and \\"modern\\" Ridicule trivializes the object of the ridicule.<br /><br /> Surfeited with constant inhumanity, the ever present surreal and gratuitous cruelty practiced on the characters of this book , the nihilism, the surreal fantasy and the whirling and confused scenarios I put it down many times. I thought Why read this? Why do I have to have my face rubbed in the absolute tragedy, the evil, the horror of North Korea? And I almost made it. But not quite. I finally gave up about two third's of the way through . So all I can tell anybody who wants to know about this book is that it's well written by a talented writer who does make up some tension relieving humorous situations along the bloody way and I think it probably gives a decently accurate account of the horror of living in North Korea - if you an stand it. Gallows reading and gallows humor! And not in my opinion worth  the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction  this year.
B00AYE8C70|1.0|Horrible! It doesnt work in kindle fire hd, i loved viber in my old android phone cos it works perfectly fine. It suits me and my bf who currently work abroad. I saved a lot from overcharging my postpaid bill with international calls and texts but now i am extremely dissatisfied with viber not working in kindle fire. Wechat is way better with good quality video call which viber doesnt support. Hope viber will fix this as soon as possible. They received very poor rating from Amazon customers.
B00BFV1K0M|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much. Took 2 days to read, just couldn't put it down. However, I felt the ending was a bit confusing and maybe a bit unnecessary? Its been left obviously for book 3, but I thought and hoped for a bit of a better quarter quell.

B000VK99Z6|5.0|British filmmakers have their own unique way of making comedy films like no one else. The now-classic \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" was one of those, and if you laughed and groaned through that one, \\"Hot Fuzz\\" will have you laughing yourself silly all over again. On IMDB, I gave it ten stars, it's that good. Simon Pegg is superb as police sergeant Nicholas Angel, and he's supported by a great cast: Nick Frost as Simon's fellow cop, Danny; Bill Nighy as the chief inspector in London; Jim Broadbent as the chief inspector in the town of Sandford; Paul Freeman (\\"Belloq\\" in Raiders of the Lost Ark\\") as Reverend Shooter; Timothy Dalton (007 in two James Bond films) as Simon Skinner; and way too many others to mention by name.<br /><br />In the story, Simon Pegg is a London policeman who's doing his job too well and showing up the others. He's promoted, but he's also transferred to the small, quiet town of Sandford, where watching the grass grow is about as exciting as it gets. When a series of accidental deaths start looking like homicides to Pegg, he begins his own investigation, since no one else believes that they were anything but unfortunate accidents, and discovers a sinister plot. At this point, things progress rapidly to an unbelievably bloody, action-filled climax.<br /><br />It's one of the funniest movies I've seen since... well, Shaun of the Dead. It's a film where if you're not laughing until you're out of breath, you're groaning. It's also quite gruesome, which is where the \\"R\\" rating comes from. And it probably set a record in spoofing clich&eacute;s from just about every major action film made in the last 20-30 years.

0425267695|5.0|**As a general warning, some aspects of the review may be viewed by particularly mean spirited or trolling people as spoilers.<br /><br />I don't usually write reviews on Amazon books but felt compelled to do so for this novel because of the other reviews I read on the site.  Simply put, all of the reviewers who gave this book poor reviews (3 stars or less) seem to all be stuck up on a few very small grammatical/clerical/editing errors.  I only noticed a few mistakes in the entire book, and they meant nothing to me - I still got the gist of the sentences and the error did not take away anything from the novel.  I suspect that those individuals posting poor reviews for this reason have some type of mental stigma against clerical errors and reading anything with any semblance of impropriety in writing/grammar must make them physically ill or something.  THEY DO NOT TAKE AWAY FROM THE BOOK.<br /><br />I would rather there be a way I could post my Amazon.com account overview so I could show my reading list; I have (almost!) read it all - WOT, Malazan, GOT, Sword of Truth, everything by Joe Abercrombie (awesome, by the way), Brent Weeks' novels, Kingkiller Chronicles, Black Company, Riryia Revelations/Chronicles, everything by Sanderson, and so on and so on.  The purpose of me saying this is just to indicate that I am not your everyday casual fantasy reader, because I am not, I read basically nothing but fantasy and I am always hungry for that next great book in the genre.<br /><br />This book reminds me very much of Rothfuss' novels in that they are told from a single character's POV (although it is 3rd person); the entire narrative is focused on the experiences of a single character.  Vaelin, the main character, is definitely in the running for the most individually awesome/BA character I have read.  If you have read Way of Kings by Sanderson, imagine an entire book of nothing but Kaladin chapters and you will get the idea of how good this book is.  The pacing is veryfast but it doesn't seem unrealistic - it seems simply like an event-by-event chronicle of all of the awesome and heroic things Vaelin does in the course of his life from approx. 11 to approx 28 years of age (and, of course, sets up the next book to continue the story).  There are often large amounts of time passing between chapters, but it doesn't seem cheap and there are no \\"montage\\" like moments in the book where the character goes from 0 to hero in the span of a few pages.<br /><br />That all being said, it wouldn't be a review without at least a couple pieces of \\"constructive criticism\\" :).  There are times where parts of the story seem forced and/or tough to believe (IE, Vaelin is just TOO AWESOME), but they are always WELL within the guidelines of the \\"rule of cool\\" - in short, the events are so cool and awesome that the small holes in the situations don't matter.  One particularly sore spot here is Vaelin's love interest, which develops over the course of the book but sort of just conveniently falls into his lap (already in love with him) in the later stages.  It's not a major facet of the storyline as a whole and doesn't really take anything away, but most people will probably think to themselves \\"if only that was how it happened in real life!\\".<br /><br />Secondly, while Vaelin is pretty well developed as a character, his close friends (\\"brothers\\") never really hit my emotional radar.  These relationships come close at times to creating an emotional connection to the reader, and you know he (the author) is trying, but it's just not there.<br /><br />There are a few other minor things I could say, but I will leave it at that.  I don't want to discourage anyone from reading this book - if you like fantasy or just want a great story, this book is a must read.  I could not imagine anyone reading this book and not being entertained thoroughly from beginning to end.  I was skeptical about a book with so many 5 star reviews, but I can say with great confidence that this book lives up to it.<br /><br />Closing statement?  If you are a fantasy or even just a fiction fan, READ THIS BOOK

There was one paragraph amongst many that took my attention: \\"When we come from this place of being who we are, we can choose to learn from external gurus, teachers, books, or spiritual philosophies. We become aware of our own inner magnificence and truth, instead of believing that others have power that we don't. In fact when we realize our magnificence and live in our true nature of love, we'll synchronistically attract the right teacher, book, or spiritual philosophy at the right time.!\\" Love to you Anita.[[ASIN:B00EOAKQF6 Walk the Pathway to Spirituality.

B0017KIBAI|5.0|This controller is an Official Nintendo made controller. That in and of itself is good, but it has some improvements over the original controller design. First off this particular model was made and sold in Japan to work with the Wii so people would have a better time playing Super Smash Brothers Brawl, while us Americans were left with whatever Gamecube controllers we had left or the classic controller.<br /><br />As such this controller actually has a copyright for 2008, because it was made more recently and with an improved design. The cord is about 3 ft longer over the original cord, which you WILL notice, and be very happy about as the original controllers had about a 6ft cord. Also the color is made to fit with the creamy white color of the Wii which isn't much, but it's the little things.<br /><br />Anyway if your looking for new name-brand Nintendo controllers and don't feel like spending 80+ dollars, you really shouldn't get anything, but these.

0307949486|4.0|\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is a little bit like my first car -- it's slow to get started, but once it gets going it moves along just fine.  I didn't lose faith during the early chapters of this book -- I knew things would pick up eventually.  And sure enough the tedium early in the story quickly turns into a plot that's fast-paced, engaging and hard to walk away from.<br /><br />Set in Sweden, this murder-mystery centers around a disgraced journalist, Mikael Blomkvist, who's hired by an aging industrialist to solve a missing-person case some three decades old.  After reluctantly accepting the offer, Blomkvist hires a social outcast (the tattoo girl) as his research assistant.  Together they uncover enough dark secrets and unspeakable truths to make your skin crawl.  The story is violent at times, and unsettling on many levels.  I haven't seen the movie yet, but I suspect that it could be a little difficult to watch.<br /><br />I'm glad that this is part of a trilogy.  To be sure, the first book is a little rough around the edges.  The glacial pace early in the book sets the table for some unlikely scenarios deeper into the plot.  \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" has its share of flaws.  But with two more books in the trilogy, I look forward to stories that are more polished, and still very suspenseful.
B00C5R8364|5.0|This is one of Forsyth's best, and long overdue.  I'd like to have a stack of unread Forsyth tales beside my chair for the rest of my life.  No one uses prose the way he does.... depth without too much minute detail, the flash of humor here and there and story lines that could come from today's headlines.  You can't go wrong with this one.

B00EL8JCGU|2.0|The trailers make the movie look like you would want to see it. Don't be fooled. First of all, the family with Pitt as the dad is so unbelievable it hurt to watch. But you figure, that's not really what the movie is abiout, so you watch on. The trouble is that the whole movie is so unbelievable you end up wishing you didn't waist your time. The movie makes Brad Pitt seem like superman and super government agent able to withstand anything thrown at him. Not even the special effects, which weren't very special, could make this movie worth paying for. If you can watch it for free you'd still be wasting your time.

The confusion point is having to change wireless networks during setup to choose your Chromecast and change its name. I haven't done the PC setup yet as I use my iPad 99% of the time.<br /><br />Netflix and Youtube on the iOS devices works great but haven't tried the PC connection yet.<br /><br />Overall I'm pleased. I'll be glad when they add more functionality/channels/etc.<br /><br />The Holy Grail for me would be Amazon Instant Streaming but I know that'll NEVER happen...<br /><br />R-<br /><br />Update: since this review was done they added Hulu and HBO Go (YES!!!)
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|FUN!!  This book is fun and filled with GREAT SCIENCE in easy to read, easy to understand language!  I've been on a mission to habituate my thoughts to Love rather than fear and this book reminds me to play play play and keep it light while remembering that this field is the stuff it's all made of ... Haha!!!
B003EYVXTG|5.0|Great movie, true to social reality without giving in to fashionable despair, with a performance better than any she will ever be able to do in the Hunger Games series.  Hopefully she will have a career in which she is offered great scripts with which she can hone and perfect her talents.  Give us more genuine female heroes, Hollywood!  It is about fighting the good fight doing the battle that has been put before you.  And it is a true coming of age story from a female perspective that does not involve sexual initiation as the major plot device.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|My husband put me on to blu-ray and I am so glad he did. This is the only way to watch movies. You feel as though you are there in the movie! The cleanliness and crispness of the movie is unbeatable. Even though it is slightly more expensive than DVDs, it is definitely worth the money, especially if you paid top dollar for a big and HD tv anyways! Highly recommend new way to watch movies,
B009TZBEKW|5.0|So much amazing music on this album. Calvin Harris teams up with a variety of artists to make a wonderful statement in the music genre.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|I remember seeing The Great Gatsby with Robert Redford in the leading role, and it was much better than this version which relied too much on glitzy scenes with large crowds.  The relationship between Gatsby and Daisy was not developed.  That said, I like Leonardo Dicaprio, but not in this role.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This trilogy is riveting..completely unpredictable...... extremely emotional ..... the ending was perfection!!!!<br />These were the best books I have read in  while very thought provoking. I could not put this book down.
B005NFWCSK|5.0|While not following the comics much at all, this take on the first group of X-Men was very good.  I'm really looking forward to the next installment in the series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Game is very addicting.  At the top 7 , aiming for number 1! At first I didn't know that by winning missions, you received those metal coins but now I know :) runs smoothly too . !
B000FC12L4|5.0|This book was a surprise.  I thought it might just be for young readers, but it was a fantasy tale for all.  The characters were well-told and the story moved quickly.  It was always believable and kept me turning the pages.  It's the first of a trilogy and I purchased the next two books with great anticipation.
B0035JNTA6|3.0|Good, funny, quirky. Good entertainment for the family with young teenagers. Similar acting and plot as in the movie 'Dodgeball'
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|Very boring action with no idea behind it. I liked very much the old Dredd with Stallone - good story line, twists, hi-tech which is high even today, battle of Good and Evil.
B00CTERB2A|5.0|Wonderful cast... imaginative stories... well done special effects made for great entertaining for the whole family! I was sorry to see it end. SyFy should come out with more Sci-Fi story lines like Eureka. But I do commend them for Eureka... Bravo!
B000LXQVA4|5.0|We bought this for my four month old daughter. The first day she used it she loved it so much she fell asleep in it. Now anytime she is in it she is just yelling with joy. So glad I got this for her!!!
B00632HWOG|5.0|Yahoo! Mail is a solid app that you should definitely get if you prefer a stable, concise, dedicated mobile app for one of the world's most desirable email service providers. I love the interface's sharpness and contrast and the way that I works predictably in relation to its non-Android counterparts. FYI, at present, there's a tiny dynamic ad link at the top of the default inbox, but I'm not sure if that's the case for premium Yahoo! Mail customers. Yahoo! is really seems to be rolling out a lot of apps and features lately, and I can't help but be somewhat impressed with the results.
B00EVCGUNY|4.0|Very powerful & passionate. Definitely a great listen. This trio is the real deal and will go very far! Support!
0399160450|4.0|The book read it self I just turned the pages, Love the Clancy- Greeny combo. Can't wait for the next installment.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Real story, well acted stays true to the novel, all the scenes are very realistic. great attention to detail in the filming.
0765316994|4.0|Because he does work behind the scenes on Sci-Fi he can write a book like this. Scalzi always entertains, he is one of my favorites.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is a great app. Allows my daughter and me to both wake up on time. The numbers are big enough for my husband to see without his glasses and not so bright that it keeps us awake at night. We love that u can wake up to music too instead of the annoying buzzing sou dace some alarms have.
0307269752|5.0|What can I tell you that you haven't already heard? A great first book, awesome characters and original story line i a place we don't usually go, the book is definitely better than the film.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|One of the reasons I have watched this movie over and over again is the music.  Really enjoy the taste of Hawaii when listening to this and so as a part of my pre vacation purchases I had to buy this so we could listen to it in our rental car on both Kauai and Maui.  The music is soothing and really gets you into the Hawaiian Island frame of mind.<br /><br />Gabby Pahinui's recording sound amazing.  They did a really great job of remastering his music.. I highly recommend this cd..
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Magnetized like everything Apple. Perfectly fits. Easy to snap on and off. I was looking for a cheaper version but could only find this for $10. Oh well. Awesome product.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I did not look for any deep meaning in this book (and if I had the idea going in that there would be &#34;deep meaning&#34; I would not have bothered with this book).  You will read this book quickly because it is rather short and you want to know what happens next.  It is just a good story!
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|A pleasant, warm read. The journey of a man, his wife, and family is told through kind eyes. Touching and worthwhile.
B005PK56TA|3.0|The show was good and entertaining but too graphic with regards to homosexuality and also gore and violence. The season finale didn't really finish the story.
6305428050|5.0|i loved this movie as a kid must have seen in 20 times.  i bought it for my kids so they can enjoy it too!
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I've been using the free desktop version for a long time. I wasn't crazy about having to pay for the tablet version, especially annually, but it works well with my desktop version in sync.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I am updating this review to say that yo ucan get it to work in Canada.  The caveat is that you need to use and iPad or iPhone to do the setup.  Original review below.<br /><br />I had thought this would allow me to broadcast anything from my laptop or phone to the TV, but no.  It works with Netflix and YouTube, and some other apps from the phone. Not at all from the laptop, unless there is some kind of app I need to install.<br /><br />On the plus side it allows you to use your phone like a remote.<br /><br />****<br /><br />Nowhere in the description did it say this is only for US customers, however, it will not function in Canada, and it will not connect if you are VPN'd to another (American) network.  Boo!  I want this to work!
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|This is nowhere near as good as the later books in the series, but does give a little history on Harry and his early trip to Australia which is referenced in the series. It also gives more insight into Harry's darkness as we read about early tragedies. As a stand alone book... Meh...
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I envoyed this spook thriller.  A great follow up to the «Lion».<br /> I hope To read more about John Corey and Kate!
B002U0KHMY|5.0|Came quickly and in perfect condition. Love the series and looking forward to the new season! A definiate must see!!
B009JZWO3I|4.0|Nothing like a good intellectual dual. I enjoy the series plenty due to the high complexity of the legal cases from week to week, yet how many of those same clients keep recurring within the weeks to follow.
B005OKTPKC|4.0|A light, cozy little book that would be a good read during the long winter nights, if you have nothing better to do. There's little drama going on, no thrills, and no twists. Just a feel-good, laid back story following the unspectacular misadventures of a young lawyer fed up with his corporate law firm, who's ready and willing to dive in head first into any practice that allows him more time with the family. It's not a bad book, but it's by no means a thriller -- just a good story, and a very well told one at that, as expected.
0763660531|5.0|Just read this book to my daughter and she was in love with it.  She couldn't wait for me to turn the pages over and she felt like being part of a big adventure.
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|I tried 25 bottles and it never broke on the line making them useless.<br />It could be me, but I doubt it.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Of course we knew we loved the hell out of the series before we got it on bluray or else we wouldn't have.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Though I haven't made it far the game is fun and enjoyable you play as one of the beloved minions as he embarks on his quest to be minion of the year .
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I realize I was primarily further lining George Lucas pocket by buying this, but Star Wars on Blu-ray was hard to pass.  For the price, I was expecting a better print quality on the packaging.  Not anything super glossy or over-done but at least cleanly printed.  Perhaps this was a deliberate artistic decision but as the consumer, it seemed more like a premium price for average packaging.  The Blu-ray discs themselves and the video/audio quality is great.  No complaints whatsoever with the discs.
B0063M22QO|5.0|great game.  fun to play while watching with my husband.  we take turns playing.  my husband is a bit better at playing than I am
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Just got Ver. 1-4-0 on Kindle HD.  Game starts up touch Moon of Endor loads the levels when I touch level #1 pauses then throws me out of game back to my carousel.  HELP!!!!  Works fine on my Samsung Stratosphere I405 phone.  Really want to play on my 8.9 HD!  HELP!!!!<br /><br />UPDATE 9/14/13 Found another update waiting for me when I got home from work.  Downloaded and now all works well.  Also updated AB Space and new Crystal level works great too.  Thanks developers for the rapid fix for AB Star Wars.  Can't  wait til the 19th  Star Wars II...
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|I want to preface this by saying I am a die-hard NIN fan.  I've been sleeping in a NIN t-shirt since I was 13 years old.  I've seen them in concert many times. I listened to The Fragile for about 2 years straight after it came out (and still do regularly).  I could watch And All That Could Have Been over and over.  And I personally think this might be my new favorite NIN album.  I'll admit I was hesitant (see what I did there?!) for this album after NIN's supposed retirement (I knew they'd be back) but this album exceeded my expectations ten-fold.  The break obviously did him good.<br /><br />This album combines the best of The Fragile and Year Zero (my two faves) with some raw edginess of The Downward Spiral.  For those lamenting that they wanted it to sound \\"harder,\\" maybe they aren't really fans of NIN music.  Most of NIN's stuff is electronic and moody and sometimes very poppy.  The Downward Spiral and With Teeth are probably the hardest albums and those are not my personal favorites.  It's 2013.  Trent's been doing this for 24 years.  His sound has to evolve.  I don't know why Trent would want to put out a new album that sounds exactly like an old album, and I sure as hell don't want to listen to it.<br /><br />This album has the poppy quality that I love mixed with the layered soundscape moodiness that is classic NIN.  It is one of those albums that you hear new nuances every time you listen to it.  There is not one song that I don't like on the entire album, and that's rare.  It's been in my car on repeat since I got it.  It simultaneously makes me want to dance yet sit alone and listen to it on headphones.  I think this album could even be the one to attract new fans who have never listened to NIN's music.<br /><br />I can't wait to see them on tour in November and see how they bring this to life!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Wish that there were not  levels. I milestones better than most open the door games. I hope they make  more soon.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|good choice good tme killer and well worth downloading i defiantly  recommend  this app to anyone looking to kill some time
B003NX75B8|5.0|This was one of the most beautiful an and inspiring books I have ever read. If you love books about love and someone finding themselves, this is most definitely the book for you.
B003W0BYQ4|3.0|Never did figure out why Deano was the drunk. What was the cause, Angie was cute back then, Ricky sings well. Similiar plot as El Dorado.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great graphics are part of the fun for this demanding game.  Just when you think you have the game down pat here comes something new.  You could play for hours .  .
B00ESY827C|4.0|Not much to tell, big bucks spent here to tell a rich man's story. Better than the old version(s), Worth watching, but you need to watch it and pay attention. Fast moving.
B005HCI72O|5.0|I love it. I have not done a great deal of reading until I started my first book in this series. Now I have finished my 4th novel. I just can't stop reading these books. It has even inspired me to look up the Scottish history of the time. Now all I need is someone to clean my house as I keep choosing to read over housework.... Thank you Diana.
B00EL8JCGU|1.0|I purchased the movie just to see what one of these is about. Waste of time. I suffered through this thing just to see how Hollywood is wasting its time these days. I wasted almost two hours of my life. I might end up a Zoombie.......Never, never again.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I thought that I will receive show and tell hands on this app. For me it has no use. Too exclusive not available to play in my kindle.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|This book is fabulous, it is well written and a easy read. This changed the way I approach my work day and it feels great. I no longer worry about completing the items on my to do list by the end of the day. Now when I drive to the office every morning I ask myself what's my ONE THING !
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I actually get it for my daughter to play and it result fun to play. She enjoyed it as well. Though is easy to pass for the next level.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|The product arrived several days after I ordered it instead of the anticipated shipment date.  It is easy to put together.  I purchased the sweeper specifically for a quick clean-up with my area rug under my dining room table, as well as other areas in need of a quick clean-up.  It arrived yesterday. I charged the battery last night.  I used it this morning and it is an EXCELLENT product.  It is also very easy to empty the tray with all the debris inside.  I am very happy with the entire transaction.  I highly recommend this product.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|Really helpful<br />Surprised that it was so useful<br />Gave . It . 3stars because it was so easy to find out what I needed
0061153923|4.0|Nice story, enjoyed it. As usual for Gaiman very imaginative. Made my daily 1 hr each way commute quite enjoyable.<br />Don't like that this requires 20 words.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|Ridiculous and violent. This movie has no redeeming qualities and was not entertaining in the least. Also, the acting was awful
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|One of my favorites for the year! It was adventurous, suspenseful, and had a perfect realization from a kids P.O.V.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|Can I just say how sad I am right at this moment, I might just open up my laptop and start writing fan fiction on Levi, Cath, Wren, and everyone else. I absolutely loved this book!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I loved this show from the beginning, the stories are well put together and they have the right mix of actors too. This show only airs during the summer season and that is okay with me.  The USA Channel has the right idea because when the other networks show repeats, you get to see first run episodes of Suits.<br /><br />I anxiously wait for each new season, check it out
0399165274|1.0|I muat agree with the reviewer who thought this was written by a \\"ghost writer\\" for Forsyth, as this bears little resemblance to the wonderful books he has written in the past.  For the first time in years, and absolutely for the first time with this author, I did not get past the first half of the book.  Very simply it was boring and poorly written.  I have read, and re-read, all of Forsyth's books and consider him one of the very best in this genre.  This book bears no resemblance to his other writings.  There is hardly any dialogue;  there is no character development - I felt nothing, good or bad, towards any of the characters;  there is a maze of government initials, so that after a while, you lose any concept of who or what;  it read like a technical manual; unbelievably formulaic, with an incredible amount of trite, banal, cliche moments;  really silly names and plain dumb coincidences.  No suspense and no real reason to read the book.  A real shame and a real disappointment.  Tedious and boring.  The same thing happened with the Ludlum books published after his death, as they were written by other authors.... I am greatly saddened.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|I had seen the new Avengers movie but, not Captain America.  So when I got a chance to watch this I was pleasantly surprised.  Really enjoyed this movie.  Good to see how Captain America ended up with the Avengers in the future.  I liked the characters and the story.  Reminded me of my skinny teenage days when I wanted to be like Joe Weider or some of the other body builders.  Also, enjoyed the special effects although not quite up to par with some of the newer releases.  But, all in all My wife and I both enjoyed this movie and can highly recommend it for everyone.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Enthusiasts of \\"The King's Speech\\" may be interested in viewing the movie \\"A Month in the Country,\\" filmed in 1987.  Colin Firth, in his first major role, plays a stuttering ex-soldier, recently returned to England from the horrors of World War I. Restoring an ancient mural in a remote Yorkshire church, Firth's character, during the course of a halcyon summer, gradually loses its stutter.<br /><br />A virtuoso performance by the young Colin Firth, greatly complimented by co-stars Kenneth Branagh and a luminous Natasha Richardson. The nearly-lost \\"A Month in the Country\\" is a haunting and provocative film, which will increasingly intrigue one with each repeated viewing. Recently released on Region 1.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Real fun game my niece loves playing this, even I find this one enjoyable. New concept haven't played a game like this so it's a lot of fun.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|First off, I would like to say that the movie itself is a 5 star. I'm only giving this movie a 4 star rating for the reason that the blu ray 3d does not play the Dolby TrueHD track. The wife and I were watching the blu ray 3d version and to my surprise it was playing in Dolby Digital 5.1 and not Dolby TrueHD 7.1. I checked the pop up menu and it was showing the movie was set at Dolby TrueHD 7.1, but the sound quality was not there.<br /><br /> I stopped the movie and made sure my settings were good on my PS3 and restarted the movie and still no Dolby TrueHD. I decided to try the regular blu ray version (non 3d) and what do you know, the movie was playing in Dolby TrueHD 7.1.<br /><br />Now to some of you it might not be a big deal, but i just recently bought a yamaha (RX-V373) surround system that supports DTS HD-MA and Dolby True HD. I know this receiver is only a 5.1 but i tried other 3d movies like The Avengers and The Amazing Spider Man and they all play in either DTS HD-MA or Dolby TrueHD.<br /><br />I was really excited to watch the 3D version of star trek into darkness at home with the highest surround settings. I was really impressed when I saw the movie in theaters and thought to myself \\"I wounder how it would sound at home?\\". To my dissapointment i get the minimal surround sound settings at home. If anybody knows any tricks on how to fix this let me know. I tried everything, i even returned the movie and received a new one because i thought it was defective but the new one did the same thing!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|super cool game and the best part is that it's free!! some levels are challenging so they have you thinking for a minute. I also like this game for the kids because it has them thinking, it's not just some easy game they can roll thru
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Sounded like a good book 2me and Hay House was connected.  I teach similar things in classes.(17 years)  Great book!  Darlene
B00B9366VO|3.0|There were parts of the documentary I loved, but as the show moved on it seemed to be more an homage to the sound board, not Sound City.  Instead of endless opinions to a lifeless, albeit excellent, sound board, why not more footage of great bands doing what they did in Sound City?  Even a few songs by Tom Petty, Neil Young, Fleetwood Mac, and any of the rest of the bands mentioned would have made this documentary a &#34;must see&#34;.  As it is, it's not a &#34;must recommend&#34;.  Too bad.
B00ET47USI|1.0|I downloaded it and I don't like it.  Instead of me getting to make the choice of where I want to place my cards, it places them for me.  When I hold down click to move the card where I want, it is slow and begrudgingly moves it there. Winning every game is not a game or a challenge of the wits; it is a mindless exercise in time wasting.
B005SAP45I|3.0|In some foreign language Disney must mean &#34;slow death by strangulation&#34;.  I knew when Pixar sold out to Disney that slow death was imminent, and the process has begun.  Disney has begun the sequel / prequel / over-marketing blitz that makes people sick of things, a la Pirates of the Caribbean, and Pixar will be dead, metaphorically speaking, soon enough.  Pixar was a phenomenal success because they focused on stories meaningful to kids that engaged the mind, minus silliness and slapstick and sophomoric humor, the very things Disney is so &#34;good&#34; at.  Now we have in the Disney-managed Pixar era Cars 2, Monsters U, and Brave.  The bar is near the ground.  Cars 2 is a simplistic rehash of the original Cars.  It does not extend the story line in any meaningful way, the story is blandly simplistic, and the whole thing seems geared to Disney's marketing machine (no pun intended).  Save your money, weep for Pixar, and move on.  There's nothing to see anymore.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I haven't finished all the episodes from the first season yet but I am rapidly working my way through them!  Good show so far.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|You can learn a lot from this type of show.  A lot about real relationships between men and women.  A lot about how a community can make a difference when they band together to effect change.  A lot about a small community helping each other to live, to change, to grow and to encourage each other.  Much about compassion, empathy, clarity, dealing with tragedies, sharing your blessings and making the right decisions...
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Works smoothly and is fun to play.  Exercises the mind as well to keep the brain cells from getting slow.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was my first book by L. Modify. I very much enjoyed her style of writing. I look forward to reading more from her!
B00ANTX3HA|4.0|Concentrates on Viet Nam, which is understandable, however I remember Robert McNamara differently and would have liked more insite on some of his policies. I remember him as a &#34;bean counter&#34; who wanted to number everything, from &#34;body counts&#34; to judge combat success to weapons systems for everybody. When success was judged by &#34;body counts&#34;, made up numbers became the norm and weapons for everbody resulted in millions (or billions) sqaundered on the F-111 and XM-70. He seemed to given free reign to talk about himself (gee, see how great I am).
B00003CXDD|4.0|My husband is an oddity. He likes chick Flix and fairy movies...(go figure)...but he likes this move, which I bought as a gift for him.
B0026SFEW8|5.0|Still super fun to watch, glad I rented in HD. Should have bought it. Made me laugh love it still
B00C5R8364|4.0|Forsyth always seems to be on the cutting edge regarding current events and politics and does a great job of making things &#34;real&#34;. A good read.
0385523394|5.0|Enjoying the read.  I read before I go to bed at night, can't seem to put it down.  I find myself reading until midnight or later.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|This game was great as a flash game, and even better on moblie. It is a greatly paced tower defence game, with a colorful artstyle, something more games could use. The towers are balanced based on price and power, each one having totally unique upgrades and abilities. However, the game has one problem: the in-game currency. You can get infinite &quot;Monkey Money&quot; and &quot;Tokens&quot; in game, but it comes at a very slow pace. Unless of course you pay more money. If the game came at a higher price with higher amounts of Monkey Money in-game, it would be 5-stars. Otherwise, this game gets 4/5 stars. Compared to all of the other apps you could get for $2.99, this is definately worth it.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I think this book has a lot of action in it, but to me it wasn't romantic enough. After Jace and Clary kiss, it seems they just go bak to always fighting.Then the worst part is that they think their brother and sister!!! ewwwwwwwwwww
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show! Totally worth it. I would definite recommend it to anyone who loves zombies or this show. It's epic
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|The concert itself I really enjoyed, picture is what is intended and can't complain. The 5.1 audio on the other hand is defective. I did enjoyed watching it but would be nice to get a 5.1 HD sound.
B00321GTJU|4.0|This production is magnificently shot--the kind of cinematography that one often hopes to find in IMAX film productions. Two aspects pervade the entire production: First, the irrelevance of human beings in matters planetary and second, the predominance of the struggle for survival among the planet's organisms.  Both aspects are important, given the hysteria about human beings causing global environmental change.  The show demonstrates that planet earth is in constant flux, as is the entire universe.  Man is merely a tiny and inconsequential blip on the galactic radar screen. As the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer once observed, \\"We can regard our life as a uselessly disturbing episode in the blissful repose of nothingness.\\"
B008AX1HD8|3.0|Found it hard to get into.  Have only read 3 chapters.  Will try again`A pity as a friend recommended highly
B007IWG3WC|4.0|that chick should have run all the way across the atlantic and the pacific for making a shark learn how to think...wow how smart was that. Good movie to poke fun at.
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|I love watching them on YouTube, but the audio quality of the CD makes it even more enjoyable.  If you love WOTE you won't be disappointed.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|If you need to wake up this will get your there and anywhere else you have to be if you have to be there on time. I hope this covers the subject properly. You get move if you pay for the extras.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Neat application to stream video and websites to your TV. However, in 2 different hotels I tried it and it didn't work.  Mainly due to settings on their wifi.  I believe that Google is expanding its use because currently it doesn't allow streaming on certain apps. Especially competitors like Amazon!
B001XUH69Y|4.0|The allure of black and white movies are undeniable for those of us who really like good movies with a good cast and a fantastic theme. They don't really make them like this anymore...
B005544TRQ|2.0|This show was  awesome! We are a little disappointed in the use if GD so much however and now has sex in almost every episode. This was a family friendly show with teens and now is turning in to a &#34;R&#34; rated.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I've been using this for some time now and I am upside down about this app, I can do so much with it and for the price I paid for it, I've been paid back over and over again. Oh I love this app for studying and just making notes here and there. It works well for me
B006ZCWTXS|5.0|This is an excellent CD.  She is very jazzy and somewhat blues.  She sounds much older than she is. Great.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|They have absolutely no R&B/Hip Hop stations in or around Harrisburg Pennsylvania. you have to live closer to Maryland, DC, Pittsburg or Philly to hear anything worth listening to. I was feeling deprived until I got Tunein and I can catch anything from anywhere and have myself a music party where ever I am.
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|I am a huge, huge fan of the rebooted Star Trek 2009. Honestly, I wasn't even a Star Trek fan and knew nothing about it until I watched this movie. That has to say something. Now, unfortunately, the follow up to it I had really high hopes for considering how good the first one was. I'll admit, it was a decent movie, and entertaining to watch. But in terms of the overall movie, it's a very poor sequel I believe to the first one. The plot and script just wasn't great at all. The worst of all is how we were kept waiting for 4 years to see this... Really would think that given all that time to make this movie, would have turned out a lot better.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Goonies gets a new generation of fans with my grandchildren. What great entertainment. They especially enjoyed the water ride down the chute.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Wonderful story told through the eyes and heart of a dog.  Entertaining all the way to the end.  Didnt want it to end.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Free version was great so want to encourage these folks to continue.<br />Purchased the full version using one click Amazon purchase.<br />Still waiting for it to download which is VERY unusual.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|This was great to read while I wait for the third book to become available.  It filled in the gaps and explained so much.  Well written.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|A story of love, passion and family from the eyes of man's best friend. It kept my attention. Worth reading.
1419701533|5.0|Good deal for the entire group of books. Made my son happy when he opened one of his many xmas presents to find his box of DIary of a Whimpy kid...
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|An amazing TV show! Tatiana Maslany deserved to be nominated for an Emmy. She is phenomenal in all of the roles she plays. It's as if a different actress plays each character, not just one.
B0024RID6U|5.0|I bought the CD to replace a cassette tape I had as a kid.  It was my first Stones album.  Great stuff.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|We both enjoyed this book and reading to each other on our kindles. Good twists that we just didn't see coming.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|Top 5 All-time Favorites!  Why this classic-to-be didn't walk away with every single award in every single category is a mystery to me.  I've seen it on stage several times and watched the DVD countless times - and each time I still want to clap at the end.  Why Emmy Rossum went from this ultimate plateau to a sleeze on on a beyond-reality TV junker baffles me - and I'm no purist.  But, I suppose it would not be ever possible to reach higher than her perfect female lead role in Phantom.  The male role of the Phantom, played by Butler, is, by definition, the featured role, but she stole the show - as a teenager. But if you are considering it for the first time, it is a musical - and perhaps even more &#34;opera-etic&#34; than most. But I don't know why I am even saying any of this since surely everyone has already seen this masterpiece. Just my opinion. For a twist, see the Andrew Lloyd Weber sequel - which is poor in comparison but takes the female role to a surprising, almost shocking but contrived outcome.  Seems the Phantom did the deed after all.
B004T5R2HQ|2.0|So I needed to make some pdf's really quickly and send them in to my employer, but I guess I'm not smart enough to use this program.  I ended up taking a photo, emailing it to myself on my laptop, paste it into a word document, crop it, save as pdf, then email that to my boss....that took me less time than messing with the app for 25 minutes trying to figure it out.  It has potential, but I couldn't figure it out in 25 minutes (I'm obviously not as hip as some people, but I am usually competent with IT stuff).
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Extremely well written novel that depicts the courage and strength of surviving teen cancer victims. It was the most unusual love story that I have ever read ( except for Poe's morbid versions of love) that made me cheer for the characters.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I like that sleep timer and alarm functions. The weather function redirected to other app, mmmm... Thank you very much anyway.
B000J025AE|5.0|It was a nice remake of the original.  It was made to include more modern relationships and preserved the message of the original.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|It´s just as simple as I spected for a low quality camera I have in my device. Not much chances to improve, so...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Nice way to spend quiet time.  Makes you use your deductive reasoning. Great . Fun and entertaining not just a hunt and find game. There is thought processes
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Everyone should ead this book young and old. It touches on the beauty of being different. Soon to be a movie!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|AWESOME  this game is just plain awesome the graphics are great and game play is amazing  I got this app and it was totally worth it  you can breed dragons and buy dragons you can also use gems to speed building up also you can mix breeds and create epic new dragons to show off to visitors and make your park awesome by adding decorations and buildings you can also buy a race track I won't spoil everything for you but this game is awesome make sure you get this game and tell your friends family and every one you know to get this game it is available for  kindle and iPad and iPod and iphone  get this game now
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|A searing event in her past threatens Minnie continuously. She is a woman with insight  and intense concern for the well-being of others.  She works quietly but diligently to improve conditions for working-class families.  Plans for her upcoming nuptials are in place until . . . well, you will read all about them in the book.
B007RJUHB4|4.0|I love Florence and the machine, and this album was pretty good. I love unplugged music, and if a artist can't do a version like that, they suck! This isn't the best I have heard, but very good. Worth every bit of money spent. The songs are amazingly done.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I haven't been playing that long, but I,m already up way past my bedtime. Very addictive. Keep up the good work.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|i wanted to download candy crush onto my kindle and was very sad to discover this app was not the real thing.
B00AE2KZNQ|5.0|This is one of those movies that really makes you want to dislike the bad guy and root for the other guy even when they are all really bad guys funny huh.
1612680011|5.0|I look at my life and my finances completely different after reading this book. I've listened to the audio book version at twice and I expect to do so again in the near future. I can't recommend this book enough!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and loved it. I haven't seen this DVD version but I gave it to my son for Christmas and he and his wife love it. I can't tell you anything about the quality or the extras, but he says they are great.
B00819ER0Q|5.0|This movie is an elegant argument for the innate libertarianism in all humans.  When Truman recognizes that he is trapped in a programmed world of guaranteed outcomes and safety he breaks out of his &#34;utopia&#34; to experience a life of freedom.  If you do not cheer Truman's victory over big brother and corporate life then you have lost your soul.  This is a wonderful political metaphor...social utopia vs. a life with meaning and consequences.  Good for teens.  This story is a good springboard to discuss the differences between socialism and true freedom.  Well done on many levels.  Delightfully entertaining.
B00CATSONE|3.0|This is a quick and easy read, especially if you skip the beginning and end that are about geniuses in general. I don't know that there is anything earth-shattering about Tesla in the middle of the book that is devoted to him, but given how little is out there (still) on this amazing man and his work, I try to read everything I can find on him. It's a freebie for Kindle, so you're not out anything, really. I read this in a couple of hours and I did enjoy the part that was about Tesla. Still searching for that really good biography of him.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|It is a great way to get (or keep)in touch with people on a professional level. Very informative. I love the discussion groups, you can get a lot of ideas.
B00F35B8F8|2.0|Same old crap. Nothing surprising. People seem to be running out of ideas when making films like these. From the beginning to the end, I knew what was going to happened before it did. seen it all before.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever. So addicting. It makes you want to not stop playing. Right now I am working to get 50000 coins do I can get the best board I can't wait.
B007VTUYWW|2.0|I was dissapointed. Overall, a poor storyline with no interesting characters and bad stunts. Jolie could not save the day in this boring and very predictable waste of time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am addicted to this game and its something the whole family can play trying to get the highest score and the most bananas and challenging your friend's it's very cool
B002HFJ77S|2.0|Since I have read and liked \\"Undomestic Goddess\\" from Sophie Kinsella, I expected a similar high quality in this book, but was disappointed. Particularly disappointing is the character of the heroine Lara. She sounds fickle-minded and shallow, but towards the end her character changes for the better. I guess the author whats to show a big contrast in Lara's behavior to emphasize the impact of the ghost suddenly appearing in her life. Even considering it is already in the realm of unbelievable, I found the characters not well sketched out. You really need to suspend any rational thought to believe the story line of how Lara meets the hero of the story. The way Lara seems to keep talking to herself, and Sadie, the ghostly great-aunt, \\"screams\\" to make people hear her... it is all a bit too much. Even the mystery/suspense part of the story is highly contrived (without going into details that would spoil the suspense!).<br /><br />It's a light book alright, but unfortunately I did not find it humorous. I couldn't get past the thought that it was all ridiculously unbelievable.
096798467X|5.0|This book, although written on a somewhat technical subject, is an enjoyable read.  The author conveys a positive, you-can-do-it attitude.  When contemplating an undertaking like building a clay oven, that kind of encouragement is very helpful.  Its easy to talk yourself out of undertaking such a project, so Denzer's cheerleading and \\"just get out there and try it, it will work\\" writing style is appreciated.<br />The book has kind of a greeny, hippy vibe to it.  That's not a bad thing, it just might not suit everyone's preference.  There's a lot of circle-of-life-positive-energy-return-to-the-earth stuff there, but the remaining content of the book makes it worthwhile whether you get into that aspect or not.  Personally, I tend to agree with a lot of it, but from a different perspective, so it wasn't really a stumbling block for me.<br />Obvious throughout the book is the author's enthusiasm for clay ovens and hearth bread.
0345525558|5.0|I facilitate a book club in my community and someone had recommended this book to me while exercising at the gym. Boy was it amazing. The language was beautiful and the story was wonderful.  The whole group loved the characters and the story and we all would recommend it to others. What was great was that it was something different than the traditional bookclub selections. I was also in awe of the whole Language of Flowers topic of which I was totally unaware. Happy Reading to all.
B008C20TDG|4.0|Straightforward and no-nonsense. This is great for newbies and had some great tips for those in the know as well.
B00190OHD6|4.0|Very romantic a good movie to curl up with on a cold night when you have nothing to do. Great
B00ET47USI|4.0|I do not like that you have to fill empty cells before dealing more cards can occur.  Your average Solitaire is that you empty columns<br />and place all cards on the kings. Not this....Why is this?? It plays on my nerves after a while.  A twist on the original idea.<br />f you can get past that, it is a fun game.
B00B4Z5J92|4.0|Great movie. Just felt like it was a bit too long, and a lot of Dave Grohl, who I love by the way.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|If a strength and intent was \\"one more little box you could take with you, and have your YouTube and NetFlix at a hotel\\", at least get a Roku that could do both HDMI and component for hotel/motels with crappy TVs.  This is a neat device on paper, but I can't find a hole in my life to fill with it.  Roku has too much going for it (minus the lack of YouTube at present, granted), but get over yourself, turn off the TV for one damned night or watch YouTube on your other 8 devices, people.  The inability to cast from Chrome on an Android phone or tablet (so far) is again, the dumbest of deal breakers here.  At best, it lets me send something annoying for my kid from a Windows Chrome browser tab (lets call it ABC Mouse, for example) over to the TV across the room, while I still browse at the PC, but this is hardly a mover of worlds.<br /><br />I have high hopes that things will develop and blossom for this little gizmo, but I just bought my first Roku, and three days later, bought two more.  So, tinker away, Google, and open this one up wide to developers and garage tinkerers from all walks of life.  For this to matter, it needs to have something... ANYTHING... a weather channel, some newsfeeds, RSS, come on...
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I don't normally care for movies that get so much media hype, but this one is the exception. I loved it!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love ti's game..action packed..fast paced and highly addictive..got to love it. Try it.You won't regret it. My favorite game. !!!  ;)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game. Needs more levels. It's a good game to play if you need something to fill in short blocks of time where you're waiting for something.
B000FC130E|4.0|beutifully written, dark and witty and gritty set in a vivid underworld that is easy to lose yourself in. i couldn't put it down.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have looked for this movie for a while and it was great to watch it again. I was very satisfied with how quick it arrived too.
B000FC12SM|5.0|For years I despised the hoopla surrounding these commonsense type of books. Sorry now I didn't read it before. Very insightful. Supremely useful.
B008D36INE|1.0|one of the most boring movies ever.  it starts slow and never picks up, even the ending.  you'll ask yourself, \\"did I really just waste my time for this?\\"
B00E00RB5I|5.0|Who doesn't love the music of EWF?  I can remember being in a dorm room, in the 70's and someone putting on the Album , &#34;Last Days and Times.&#34;  Come, on? You hear it all the time; man, this is REAL music! If that's the case,<br />Now, Then, & Forever is real music for your soul.
B00004YVEC|5.0|\\"Star Wars\\"... sigh, \\"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,\\" is the greatest standalone science-fiction movie of all time. It tells a complete story and you can enjoy it without watching another second of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Darth Vader, R2-D2 and company.<br /><br />But in doing so, you'd deprive yourself of the greatest sci-fi film of all time -- \\"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back\\" -- no qualifiers necessary. I'll probably pack this flashback/review with more hyperbole, but this is a generation-influencing masterpiece the likes of which we've rarely seen since.<br /><br />It's difficult to credit any one particular aspect as every element from the script, performances, special effects, John Williams' unforgettable score and Irvin Kershner's impeccable direction ranks as some of the best, not just in the genre, but in all of cinema.<br /><br />\\"Empire\\" is one of my two favorite films and the one that first triggered my immense love of the power of movies. Even if you've been weaned on other sci-fi/action franchises, this is the one that surpasses them all and warrants my highest recommendation. See it and prepare to be captivated by the most spellbinding sci-fi film of them all.
B00340LM8C|5.0|Alfred's greatness shows in this movie.  On a great HDTV, this shows the quality of the filming.  The story and the actors are supreme.  An all-time great movie.
1599218011|5.0|This is not about diet, it is about loving yourself and eating accordingly and then experiencing abundant health.  When we're healthy and feeling great, life takes on a whole different meaning.  Get ready to shake lose all those paradigms of what you think eating, a meal, or food should be.  Be open-minded to embracing a whole new way of connecting your body with real food that hasn't been over processed, pre-packaged, or marketed as making you feel good.  This book shows us how we were always meant to enjoy giving our bodies real nutrition and reaping the benefits.  Way to go, Kris, for not just accepting the status quo and blazing a trail that we can all learn from.
B00ECU1A6C|4.0|The storyline is similar to other Friendship is Magic stories.  I don't know why I don't give it 5 stars.  It's probably because nothing really stands out to make it exceptional, but there is nothing bad about it either.  Not bad ... it was quite enjoyable.
B00D6QUMWG|4.0|I love Anna Netrebko!  I think she is the real deal in being a great singer who can act.  I liked, but did not love this Verdi album.  She got through Macbeth and Ernani OK, hit her stride with Don Carlo and fiished well with Trovatore.  When I hear Macbeth, it is hard to get Callas out of my head and the same with Ernani and Sills or Don Carlo and Trovatore with Caballe. Nevertheless, Netrebko does well and her success with Verdi in the opera house is a good sign that she is well on her way in becoming a good maybe even a great Verdian soprano.
B0031RSBS2|1.0|By the time you've read 12 Jack Reacher books you realise how cooky cutter formulated they are. It's my last.
B008RKGF1I|5.0|Haven't seen it in quite a few years. Was fun to watch and see how fashions and trends were back then
B00CTT9646|3.0|First the film was fine, the usual Star Trek fare although I was a bit put off by the engineering section (in this and the first film BTW) looking like the boiler room of a major industrial facility. The problem was with the Blu-ray disc hesitating and black out sections for a split second during play. I originally suspected my player but on trying other Blu-ray discs and old DVDs did not experience any problems. Playing the disc again and the problems re-manifested which I can only attribute to the disc. I didn't try either the accompanying DVD or the 3D disc as I had already decided to return the product for this and the following reason.<br /><br />You would have to be a certifiable trekkie to accept what was called a &#34;Collectible Limited Edition Phaser.&#34;  Besides being a poorly painted lump of miscast misaligned metal it had no electronics in it whatsoever which while not actually stated might be inferred from the product description. Heck you can buy operating phasers from any 'Dollar' store for a buck.<br /><br />I will be reordering the 3D combo pack sans Phaser.
B008EDGBW6|3.0|I'd heard this cd was really nice and I could just let it play all the way through without skipping songs, but not so. I thought his last cd was great, but I wasn't so impressed with this one.
B003F44QRQ|5.0|This is one of my top 10 all time favorite movies.<br /><br />It's got the Frog brothers.<br />The 2 Cory's.<br />And Jamie Gertz in her prime!<br /><br />Nuff Said!!!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I read this for book club and it was the first one that I actually finished before the book club meeting - could not put it down.  Fun to read about things I know about in the Silicon Valley and relate it to OK - old knowledge.  Great fun.
141690977X|4.0|The book's title was a turn off. I gave this book to a friend who was in a painful relationship. She did not read past the title.<br />When I read this book I found it to be an easy read. Inside was some positive and helpful information.<br />I would recommend reading the book in between relationships as a heads up.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very interesting story line. It is interesting and scary to think how I might have reacted in similar circumstances. It brings to mind, also the secrets we keep and the long range effects of that. Good read.
B000VIPJKM|4.0|Legally Blonde was very funny and our family really enjoyed it.  It's a nice family move and gave us lots of laughs. :)
B0043RSK3K|5.0|This book should be read by every American and for that matter everyone in the world. After reading this book if you do not feel a need to look deeper and fix this broken system before we no longer have the power to do so something is wrong! Amazing, amazing work Oliver Stone and Peter Kuznick and team! You have remembered the history that has stopped us as a nation to lead with understanding, compassion and love for our fellow man who is not that different from ourselves. It is so easy to get caught up in fear and nationalism and prejudice and hatred. Why is it so hard to put ourselves in others shoes, see life from the others perspectives. Lets make this world a better place while it is still in our power to do so! Thank you again for your hard work and dedication and sacrifice in bringing this work to the surface...humbling indeed!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|J.J Abrams reboot of Star Trek definitely has a quicker action packed pace.  But it's done well.  I think all of the casting was top notch with a special nod to Zachary Quinto for showing emotion without showing too much emotion.  Only thing I didn't like was the nods to previous franchise films which felt a bit contrived.  Still great film.  5 stars.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I am only halfway through this book and I already wish it would go on forever. Roberts weaves some essential philosophical content into the story so gracefully that it seems a natural extension of the story. I am in love with at least half of the people in this book.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|this movie was intense and had a great group of people starring in it. i think everyone should at least rent this movie
B00DYFCYSO|3.0|It may be my imagination, but his voice seems squeakier than it used to. The songs all sound quite a bit alike and all come down to &#34;Oh baby, give me some&#34;.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is an excellent book. It tells a beautiful, heart-wrenching story of two teenagers that you will definitely fall in love with.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Now what can I say here? Its an app we need to view files that we download or just want to view on the web. Most of us use a lot of Apps  and download and try them and if we like them we keep them and if we don't we delete them. I still hate having to have so many words in a review.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|The Luck of the Weissensteiners by Christoph Fischer is nothing short of pure genius. I fell in love with the writing the moment I flipped the first page. The author's exquisite sense of style combines intricate historical facts with dramatic family turmoil that shocked the whole world when first revealed back in 1945. This beautifully crafted novel is filled with desperation and sheer determination to survive against insurmountable odds.<br />Greta Weissensteiner falls in love with the young man who sneaks books from his library and uses them to see her. Wilhelm Winkelmeier does not care she is a Jew and marries her. They live on his parents' farm where Greta is subjected to harsh living conditions and has to forget her love of books to take care of their son, Karl. Slowly, she wins the respect of Wilhelm's parents, but a storm is racing across the horizon in the shape of Nazi hatred of all things Jewish.<br />Then the unthinkable happens - the world turns a blind eye as Germany invades Austria and then Sudetenland bordering their home country of Czechoslovakia. It is only a matter of time before the terror begins.<br />The Weissensteiners have always believed in their own brand of luck that has kept them in good stead, but once the Jewish question is implemented that luck is needed time and again. And yet their luck seems to protect them, but at what cost.<br />This wonderful novel handles a difficult subject matter with style and grace, showing a close-knit family fighting injustice and never losing their dignity in the face of bigotry and hatred.<br />I must admit I was often brought to tears with several scenes so poignant and tender. This book deserves to be in every library as a reminder of man's inhumanity to man and how easily society can ignore such cruelty.<br />This FIVE STAR masterpiece should be read by every teenager as part of their school curriculum. I LOVE IT.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|so I have the origianl kindle and I love this game. I have played magic for years and mobile is awesome. I cant play with other people but its great. I did have the same problems as other users with the space issue. I deleted everything tried 5 times then got it and got all my other apps back if you like magic keep trying.
B001HC8516|5.0|I never thought I'd say this but I have 3 words to describe this book, &#34;Womans Dating Bible&#34;. For anyone who hasn't read it, you must, it changed my life.
B0068THAGY|5.0|I never watched this when it first came out, but recently it was available on my Prime membership.  Thoroughly enjoyed the story, the special effects and the cast was outstanding!  Spielberg has never disappointed me......

0486423662|4.0|What would you wish for if you could have a wish a day? Five Children and It by E. Nesbit is about five children who find a sand fairy and tells what goes wrong with all the wishes they make. I listened to this as an audio book and I was entertained. Every wish the children made seemed to turn wrong on them. There is plenty of suspense as the reader wonders how the children are going to get out of the scraps that their wishes put them in.<br /><br />The story gave some important lessons about being careful what you wish for (to be cliche) and also the dangers of wanting the material things in life. The children learn that what is really important is their family, just the way it is. The children grow wiser with every wish and are better for having met the straight-talking sand fairy.<br /><br />I was surprised to find out that this book was published in 1905. Even a hundred years later, the lessons learned by the children can apply to those of today, especially regarding the desires for things and money and beauty. I recommend this for an entertaining read.<br /><br />More reviews at [...]
B005I64U5C|5.0|I liked this movie a lot but that's probably just because I have been a huge fan all of my life.  I don't usually pick out the flaws as they have to sometimes change things up a bit to get people interested in it.  I thought the storyline was good and can't wait for the next one.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This was not as deep as Grey and Darker.  The end was not as dramatic as I felt it should have been.  I got bored at the end.  I feel the series had a reasonably good storyline.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|I really liked this game. I couldn't put it down, so I ended up spending about 12 hours on it in one sitting just to finish it. Cool (and creepy) story line and good puzzles to figure out. Well worth buying the full game in my opinion.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Don't understand how to use it as yet.  Hope my grandson will help me figure it out and be able to use it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved this next book.  Can't wait to read the next one.  Keeps you entertained.  Can't put it down.  Great read!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was as good almost as GREY and it started to bring &#34;Fifty Shades&#34; around to becoming &#34;normal&#34;.  I believe the series could have ended in this book.
B001TXWJ4M|4.0|Great show, really well written with interesting characters. However definitely for adults only. Show content is too mature for teens.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|No one bothered to tell me that you had to read 3 books in order have the complete story.  The storyline is great and in depth, but don't understand how they are going to make a movie out of it.  The movie will not be COMPLETE!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love animals and the graphics and features are great, thanks! HORSES are very cute and I feel like I am living on my own farm.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|You'll never find a better t.v. series. I'm fussy on watching t.v. and I want to be entertained, not figure out what's happening an hour ahead of the show. THIS series is awesome!! Season 4 starts in October!!
B001YB29HG|3.0|Despite great reviews from family, I found this movie a great one-time see, but I don't think there will be a second viewing.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|Ever since you added the second half of the Cloud City levels the game crashes or closes. Itdoes the same for the Moon of Endor levels. I paid for this game and can not even play it. I have a Kindle Fire. I can only play the older levels what gives?
006091307X|3.0|if you're not fully cognizant of its pregnancy then you're probably not going to enjoy The Crying of Lot 49. Pynchon is going to spend the rest of CoL dissecting, attacking and critiquing the subtext. Note: this says nothing about your abilities as a reader or a person. It says more about CoL 49 than anything. I'd agree with many of the other reviewers that state CoL 49 didn't age well. I'd say that for casual readers under certain ages it's going to be a slog and pretty unfulfilling. I'd even go further and say that for most casual readers, CoL 49's mood will totally escape them. Now, what that's a reflection of is open to debate, but I say it's a flaw of the writer to a certain extent--not as a whole. But, for those out there that can apply the contextual relevance of the times against the backdrop of the blossoming atomic age with all it's promise, horrors, alienation and divisions then CoL 49 is most certainly worth a read. View this work with the kaleidoscopic necessity similar to that of Dr. Strangelove and you'll quickly decode much of what Pynchon is doing. At one point during my reading of CoL 49 I was thinking to myself that Pynchon has certainly devised a neat little literary cul-de-sac in which many will get trapped. Later, that's just about stated exactly. To say Pynchon writes with a wink and a nod to his target reader as he treats other sadistically is putting it lightly. Navel-gazers beware, you're marked men in Pynchon's crosshairs.<br /><br />Relax, read and enjoy! If it ain't your cup o'tea, so be it. There's better Pynchon to be had.

B004X6PRO6|3.0|While this is a very interesting read about life in North Korea, it is an unusual format. In an attempt to create the feeling of displacement and shadow life in that hidden country, the author presents a story that is often difficult to follow. Characters appear under different names, events may or may not have happened, bizarre places and scenes of torture move back and forth in time. If the world of North Korea exists as presented in the book (this is fiction but the author has been in NK) it is even more dreadful than ever imagined.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|My Fiance and I went to see this in the theaters despite the negative reviews. And we thoroughly enjoyed it. Now we were not expecting some great piece of cinema, this is not that movie. But for those who would enjoy a bit of witchcraft with a southern accent, it's actually quite good.<br /><br />4/5
B0015HOFZI|4.0|The record player looks solid and works well. The front buttons could be a little more solid, but that's a small complaint.<br /><br />As for features, it does everything you expect a record player to do, with one plus you don't always see: a &#34;pause&#34; button. Not exactly pause, but it has a button that lifts the arm and holds it in place while continuing to spin the record. Press the button again and it'll gently place the needle back where it was. The effect is to pause the music while you answer the phone or whatever.<br /><br />I gave it four stars instead of five because my unit didn't work when it arrived. It spun the record but there was no audio; I think there was a problem with the plugs or the internal wiring. I had to send it back for repair or replacement. It worked when it came back, but it did add hassle and delay to the transaction.
B001OB7F98|5.0|Bjork is an amazing artist, and this is an amazing album. Probably a contender for my favorite, which is saying a lot, because I love ALL of her stuff

B001V69GB6|5.0|Incredible. I listen to Bjork all day while toiling away in my cube, and this album makes the day bearable. She is truly a unique artist
B000YDCFRE|4.0|Bought these as a replacement for one pair of &#34;classic 6&#34; boots&#34; I've had now for over 10yrs (resoled twice).  Similar to most other Timberland boots, these run slightly large.  I've noticed that Timberland converts their European sizing to American sizing slightly differently than most other manufacturers.  For example, Timberland says size 10 American = 44 European, but a check of most other shoes/boots in my closet read 10 American = either 43, or 43.5 European.  So, the general rule of thumb then is to order a half american size smaller than one normally takes and it will usually work out perfectly.  If in doubt, check the euro size on the label of your existing shoes/boots with the sizing chart on the Timberland website for American sizes and you'll see what I mean - many are about 1/2 size larger in the American size than is usually standard.<br /><br />The leather uppers on these are good quality.  However the insole and outsole are very soft material, so I wonder about the long term durability.  On the other hand, they're soft enough that no break-in was needed (comfortable from day-one), and with the welted construction I can always get the soles replaced with something more durable in the future if needed.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Used original app for over a year &amp; was very happy with it.  Hate the update!  I'm getting a new weather app and getting rid of this  one.  Lots of ads and non-weather junk on update and difficult to navigate.  Yuk!
B00EL8JCGU|1.0|OK, I thought the movie might be better than the book, I was wrong!  The movie's best part was the beginning, before the movies plot started. Should have been a chick flick and save the zombie crap for the next movie.<br /><br />You never know what Brad Pitt's character's job was, thought the NOT knowing was going to be a surprise, nope, just not important, but important enough for the US / UN to send a helicopter to get him. Eh who cares THIS MOVIE SUX!  I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!<br /><br />Let me wrap this movie up for you.<br /><br />1) Brad - father, husband, ex-something in the UN (who cares) The UN is full of bad-asses everyone knows that. LOL<br />2) Viral-Rabies - causes Zombie Apocalypse - I got it, that's why I paid the $$<br />3) Brad goes to find patient zero, with NO medical training, or info or purpose, he's an investigator for the UN (once again vague and whatever that is)<br />4)I Stopped caring about the characters, when they started jumping around the globe for NO APPARENT REASON!<br />5) Zombies sucked the insect like hoards were stupid. Could have done way better myself.<br /><br />This movie did show how incompetent the UN will be in a global catastrophe! and how horrible the script was.<br /><br />Sucked I wanted to see this one!

B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was a great read. I finished the book within 3 hours of buying it.  I loved the story and the characters
B000W7JWUA|4.0|I definitely love Settlers of Catan. It's a game that most people will play, even if they're not big into tabletop games. The game-play itself is rather straightforward, and by changing the board around, it creates a lot of options for repeat play. There are a lot of preset configurations so you don't have to worry about creating a board that creates unfair advantages to certain players, and there are expansions that allow more players and increased options. The only down side to the board not being a single unit, and this is why it gets 4 stars rather than 5, is that it reduces durability and requires a perfectly flat surface for the board to stay together.
B000IHQTIW|5.0|I love this shoe type, but I think this one I will have to send back because it is not wide enough.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|The app didn't,t work period.It would open but stayed completely with a black screen.I could not do anything with it at to turn tablet off to reboot.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Amazing book, amazing characters.  I was so happy that it was so long, but still disappointed when it ended because I wanted to keep reading.  This is a great development of a universe, history, and cultures.  It is truly entertaining and exciting.  There is great character development and you truly get sucked in to the story.  I couldn't recommend it more.

B009WO7NQO|5.0|I enjoy playing this game, with each character having new powers and the fact its ad free!  Everybody enjoys ad free games.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This is the second time I have read this book an  I have thoroughly enjoyed it.  Keep me captivated in the story of Kvothe.
B00BEYX7TW|5.0|Great movie! A must see if you like Tommy Lee Jones. He was in rare form in this movie, he kicked butt!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put this down.  I was so intrigued by Nick and Amy. Could these two exist??? Psychotic thriller at its best.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|My main complaint, after following this series over the years, buying the hardcover editions to donate to the public library, is that the ending was ridiculous. A philosophical discussion in the middle of a last battle between the main combatants is like asking your lover, \\"how was your day at the hairdresser\\", right in the middle of hanky panky time. Sanderson was not at fault for this, as this is a typical Robert Jordan bit of nonsense. And Terry Goodkind as well. And Ray Bradbury as well. Oh hell, they all do it.
0786838655|5.0|If you are a fan of Mythology, fiction, fantasy, or action books, do I have the book for you! Percy Jackson is an action packed series full of Greek monsters, Gods, Demigods, quests and battles. This book is amazing! Rick Riordan is a very talented writer. He knows how to keep you hooked, and he knows how to tell a great story.<br />This book is action packed! There is a new adventure waiting with the turn of every page. Rick Riordan cleverly combines the ancient Greek myths with the modern world as he tells the tale of teenager Percy Jackson. He uses modern day things such as cars and cell phones and incorporates them with Greek myths. It is very clever, and very well done.<br />You will never be bored while reading this book. You become educated in Greek mythology (don't shy away because I used the word education). You become a part of an amazing story, that you feel you are taking part of, and you will never want to put this book down for any reason. Rick Riordan, a very talented writer, tells a great story, and he really does it well.
B006S01GH2|5.0|The French have a somewhat unique sense of humor... After all, they think Jerry Lewis is the king of comedy!!! However, &#34;Amelie&#34; is great in any geography. Very funny, very droll, and Audrey Tautou is phenomenal. And, the supporting cast is superlative. The only chance of something this good of being produced in the US would be if the Cohen Brothers did it.<br />Highly recommended.
B007LGPSX0|5.0|Love it. Watched this show in middle school and high school. Super fun to see it streaming on here. Love the throw back fashion

B00CTT9646|5.0|If you like Star Trek you will love the film.  If you have never seen any of the other movies may be more difficult to appreciate.  But, again for a Star Trek fan, great film, great plot, loved the way the weaved the old characters back into the new film series.  Don't understand the negative reviews...did you  but the film for the film or for the extras (which are fine).  This is an absolutly great movie, hopefully more to come !
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|usually our remakes are not as good as the UK original shows,  this show is a huge exception to that rule.  the script is every bit as good.  it had to be adapted to fit the American political system which differs in many significant ways from the British one.  the biggest change is that one of the best parts in the UK one was clashes with the character based upon Prince Charles.  we have no royalty so that is wholly absent from this version.<br /><br />we do however have two of the best actors in the business in the lead roles, Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright as his wife.  Spacey is a congressman while his wife is the head honcho of a company which is bringing water to Africa.  It is charitably based since it has fund raisers and looks for grant money.  however, it is as ruthlessly run as any major corporation.  these two make a perfectly matched DC power couple.<br /><br />although there is so much going on in the show, let me mention my favorite segment. his constituency is a hick small town which is very born again religious.  a teenager is killed there because of using her phone in her car and colliding with this hideous roadway sign which spacey has supported.  the town begins to turn against spacey because of the sign so he hightails it down there to make sure he doesn't lose his congressional seat over this.  what follows is an acting tour de force as spacey morphs into a hick, complete with total faith in being a born again Christian.  he prays with the parents, eulogizes the dead girl, etc., he is absolutely clear to the audience that he despises these people but needs to do this for his career.  it is all absolutely fascinating plus deeply satirical.<br /><br />i watched one episode after another on netflix and was done in two days. i eagerly await the next season.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B000002U83|2.0|I ordered a \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" cassette from this particular vendor. The only thing wrong was that it was a CD and I don't have a CD player in my car. I have a tape deck that I'm perfectly happy with.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Finally, all the Rocky films are here in one set. It has been a long road, but here it is. These were great films. These were inspiring films. They lifted your spirits and gave you hope. It is great have them all here. Now I can place them on my bookcase and take one of the films out whenever and give it another look from time to time.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|it's not like this film is worthy of some 3 or 4-star middling review. Great Movie! JJ Abrams Star Trek movies have been a bit of a departure from what Trekkies have been familiar w/ for decades, but that's a good thing. Incidentally, it's going to be a wild ride when he does Star Wars!<br /><br />At any rate, the cast is a wonderful recasting of all those original characters. Pine & Quinto are exquisite Kirk & Spock, and who I hope play these roles for many years, as they haven't had any other actors for so long while Shattner & Nimoy held those roles. And, of course, Benedict Cumberbatch was wonderful as the villain (won't give away who he is, here ;), and I was very well fooled by just who he was until I was IN the movie (saw it in 3d).<br /><br />Just a very good addition to the canon in every way. Too bad Abrams won't be doing the next one, but the new director will have much to live up to!
B00008EYA5|5.0|All we hear is the voice of determination. Suspense and action are good, but he can't save this movie that is played out in very bad taste. Or can they? Suspense and action? Yes! Every other word seems to be a four letter word or three letter word?  The idea behind the plot was very good. Children should not watch this movie. S.W.A.T.
B0090SI4OC|5.0|I liked this movie to have a interesting  get in to and enjoy this movie and loved it to watch
B001CC7PKS|1.0|I never really cared for the Daredevil comic books. But this movie is bad not because it doesn't faithfully reproduce the comic feel and lore. No, this movie is simply bad.  You don't care for any of the characters, and Jennifer Garner as Elektra is especially bad. Elektra was the only semi interesting character from the comic books, and they made her into some bimbo with sais. The villains were just as terrible, esp Bullseye. A great villain can save a movie. We get this corny fool with a weird forehead. Such a shame. Marvel could of had a down to earth character that people cared about, and tied him in with their non powered characters.  Even ghost rider was better than this.
B005S9ELY4|4.0|This is a good movie about gangsters in the 20s. I really liked it to watch again. I would recommend it
B001N3GUIE|5.0|MGM knocked it out of the park with this movie. This movie was years ahead of its time and had 5x the budget of any science fiction picture to date. Walter Pidgeon's performance of Dr. Morbius is masterful and the plot is deep and complex. This movie also introduces Bob Kinoshita's - Robbie the Robot. Robbie is nothing like the other robots of the 40's and 50's, and is arguably the best movie robot ever created. The only real  competition to Robbie is the robot from Lost in Space - which was also designed by Bob Kinoshita.  This movie was also a first because it was the first movie score done completely without instrumentation. That's right, an all synthetic score before synthesizers even existed. Give it a watch or just buy it... you won't be disappointed.
B00BN3ECTS|5.0|This was a great movie and o loved it for anyone that liked the book. I would recommend it too
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|story takes too long to evolve. The movie should have been shorter. I was glad when it was over already
B0095GSKDE|5.0|Gladwell is an original thinker, as he has previously demonstrated in Tipping Point and Blink. I think almost  everyone will find some example  of a situation that applies to their own personal lives whether it be positive or negative.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Cuban`s informal style is entertaining, straight to the point & full of great advice. Great fast read for the entrepreneur s & aspiring entrepreneurs alike.
B0083Z614S|3.0|It ended different then I expected, I thought it was going to have more about Mary towards the middle it dragged on a bit but was all in all a good read. A little hard to make out the Yorkshire but after a while you can paraphrase.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|This book is just OK.  I had to struggle to finish it.  Too much French and too slow of a plot.
B00ENYCQX8|5.0|Great reader!<br />Holds lots of large books. And very easy to use plus it has a good book selection I love it!
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|Just like fine wine, the older Stills gets, the better he gets. That is a powerful statement considering all of the great music he has produced through the years with groups: Crosby Stills, Nash & Young; Buffalo Springfield; and a less known group but with unbelievably great songs, Manassas.<br /><br />Stills along with his group members Kenny Wayne Shepherd and Barry Goldberg, know as the Rides, have appropriately named their group. You want some GREAT GUITAR RIFFS...you have got it in 'Can't Get Enough'.<br /><br />Every song is a winner, and with the experience of Stills and musical talent of his band members, you will be very happy that you purchased it.<br /><br />The newer groups just don't make GREAT music like this...I mean think about some of the newer \\"Rockers\\" and they play, but with total distortion of their amps, and easy to play riffs without very much creativity. That being said, don't get me wrong, I am not talking about all, but many.<br /><br />The talent in \\"The Rides\\" can only come from years of experience and \\"actual talent\\" not dependent on overdubs and the over use of synthesizers.<br /><br />If you like the very best of guitar music, then you will REALLY enjoy riding along with \\"The Rides\\".
030789701X|5.0|I loved it!<br /><br />There is a lot of information and tips about character creation, places, monsters and quests from all the DLCs.<br /><br />Really worth it!

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Though I would not call it a page turner, it was a well written story with thought provoking twists.  What if circumstances were altered? Would there be a change of outcomes that could alter history?  The author hints at that possibility, but leaves us to wonder the &#34;what ifs&#34;.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I'm a guy who likes fast paced guy books. Someone gets killed you get to figure it out. This was nothing like that.  You were in the minds of two people, one being a woman, (that was a strange experience) as the book unfolds. However,this was a great read but you have get through the first 45 percent to be hooked, and you will get hooked. I found myself reading this every chance I got. In restaurants, travelling even picking this book up as opposed to watching an NFL game. No self repecting guy would do that unless the book was really a great read.<br /><br />Get it , stay with it, you'll be happy you did.
B006J420UE|5.0|This processor works well for the price.  It's no speed demon, but the system is much faster since the upgrade.  He is very pleased with it.  He plays Warframe and Battlefield 3, as well as some deer hunter games.  Haven't had any issues at all.  Have not tried any overclocking.  Good processor overall.
B000JCSPG0|5.0|Loved the movie and the tv show.  Both were very entertaining and great fun if you like sci-fi, with a lighter side.  Sometimes a break from conspiracy theory is nice!

B00181YT9S|2.0|I was so excited for these speakers to arrive, however when I got them they had a european power adapter..yikes and I had to send them back.

B009JZSC9S|5.0|I've enjoyed all the GOODWIFE series.  There are a few things that would be best left out but we must face, that is the norm for today.  I'm almost done with the series and will miss it.  Hope there will be a #5.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Saw #2, so of course I had to see the original one.  Great movie, very entertaining.  Highly recommend this movie.

0061433063|5.0|This is the fourth and final book in the Tiffany Aching series (after The Wee Free Men, A Hat Full of Sky and Wintersmith).<br /><br />Tiffany is now the local witch on the Chalk. This means she mends broken toes and blows congested noses in the nearby villages.<br /><br />When the old Baron dies under Tiffany's care (all she could do was take away the pain away), Miss Spruce the nurse accuses her of murder. On the way to Ankh-Morpork to warn her childhood friend Roland of his father's passing, she is attacked by the Cunning Man, a fiendish spirit. Roland, in turn, incriminates her.<br /><br />Later she realizes it's actually the maleficent ghost who is poisoning people's minds against witches. She has to confront him. Of course, the Feegles are here to help... or not.<br /><br />This volume is once again packed with philosophy and phun! I very much enjoyed meeting characters such as Preston (a young, smart castle guard who Tiffany befriends) and Letitia (Roland's watercolour fianc&eacute;e, with whom there's more than meets the eye). I loved this Tiffany Aching book and I'm very sad it's the last one. I wish I lived on the Chalk with these people and these values: life and death as they should be.
B00F35BV64|2.0|You know this is going to be one action-film cliché after another when it opens with the cliff-jumping scene. Good science fiction is more than computer graphics effects and ludicrous chase scenes.  This movie is not good science fiction.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|If you like tony bourdain you will love this book. It is written in the same manner as he speaks, always trying to inform. He lets you in on the little secretes of the restaurant bizz. The friends and enemy's he has made in his many years as a chef are both colorful and some times crazy . I give 5 double crusts.
B000002GVO|5.0|Great band, one from my high school years.  Helps me feel good and singing in my car.  Rock on baby!
0143038419|1.0|This just wasn't my thing. There was no compelling story but lots of self-absorbed internal dialogue. I know a lot of people liked it, and I'm sure a lot more will. The writing is excellent. It was simply not my thing.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great way to challenge your problem-solving abilities!  I am buying this game for my 79 year-old mother.  I think the difficulty levels are appropriate.
0062218867|5.0|In this 39th Discworld novel, Samuel Vimes is coerced by his wife Lady Sybil into taking a holiday in Crundells, their estate in the Quirmian countryside.<br /><br />Whereas his 6-year-old son Young Sam is delighted to discover a whole new world of animal poo, far from the hustle and bustle of Ankh-Morpork, the Commander of the City Watch is feeling totally at odds and out of his depth.<br /><br />However, Vimes's copper instincts tell him something unlawful is going on. And soon he discovers that a young goblin girl has been violently murdered and that Jefferson, the village smith, is missing. With the help of Feeney Upshot, the local pig farmer-cum-constable, he starts to investigate. An adventure that will take them underground and above water, even as far as Howondaland.<br /><br />This is a very enjoyable story, reminiscent of crime fiction. Vimes's arrival in Crundells reminded me of Downton Abbey, and I also loved exploring the Goblin cave and learning about its people. But the part I enjoyed the most is the middle of the book, when the thrilling murder investigation is in full swing.

0385720920|3.0|This was a well-written book with often very humorous and right-on-the-button descriptions of geriatric residents of Victor's mother's nursing home. Made me laugh, as a nurse who has often seen these exact patients! Some of the book hard to digest, sex addicts, etc. but flowed along. Ended skimming to get to the end. Different!
B00F35B8F8|2.0|Not enough of a plot to fill a movie. Special effects were fine. Needed more meat on the special effects bones. Very undeveloped plot and characters.
B00340ESIS|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book.<br />It's written with great humor and pace.<br /><br /> This is a guide to help you create a great, sellable script. Not necessarily the best piece piece of art.<br />To quote &#34;it is what it is.&#34;<br /><br />Valuable insights from someone who's been there.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game very fun !! Every level gets harder and sometimes it drives you mad but u finally get it after a bit !!  I recommend this to a friend!
B00CFNUMD0|3.0|holds your attention. good writing plot keeps you tuning in for more. tech quality good. Justified, when will season 4 be on prime.<br />Great show
B002NN5F7A|5.0|If they gave an award for the most F bombs dropped in one movie, GGR would be very close to the top....but don't let that stop you from following the intense dialogue with nary a moment to catch your breath.  The cast is amazing and not since the Oscars have we seen so many mega stars in one room!  As my son put it, and he is not easy to please,  &#34;it was good&#34;.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I am a fan of the Supernatural series, and have ordered all of the eight seasons.  This is one of the best seasons for the show.  A few episodes were a little too graphic/dark for me, but overall, it was enjoyable.  I enjoyed the newcomers (Benny) and the return of some of the previous seasons' characters (Felicia Day).  The story line was interesting and socal media comments seemed to be mostly in agreement with that.<br /><br />I hope the great acting and writing continues for many years.  I'd hate to see it go.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Another really good read I can reccommend it. Those poor children what a terrible life they had. Quite a sad book to read
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Mr. Grisham does it again!  A fantastic page-turner, filled with great suspense, characters and a great scheme! A great read from start to finish.
B0044AEBXY|5.0|This is not an obligatory re-master that bands tend to put out of their work every 10 years or so, it is virtually a do-over of an album that contained one of the worst mixes of all time of one of the best collections of songs in the expansive Genesis catalog. The music has a clarity and fullness that was never found on previous releases of this recording and different layers of vocals, guitars and percussion can finally be dug out from the typical Tony Banks keyboard excesses. This album is in the center of an extreme musical high that Genesis was on from 1975-1981 and now it finally sounds like it.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Admittedly, I love Star Trek so I really liked this movie.  You have all the Star Trek characters and their idiosyncrasies, Klingons, tribbles, Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) fights, warp speed, different looking aliens, ----  all things that make a Star Trek movie a Star Trek movie.  There were many times I just giggled because this reminded me so much of the original series.<br /><br />If you're a trekkie, you'll enjoy this movie.
B00EL8I8IS|3.0|Not a great script but cool action scenes with enough going on to make you forget about the horrible script writing with laughable dialogue .<br />Lots of fun if taken for what it is a new take on the zombie platform !!
B007STBUHI|5.0|Even though I have only seen the trailer and previews in the past the full movie was still a thriller and kept my interest throughout the whole movie.  Compared to some of the supposed thrillers out today Hollywood has not outdone this movie. The current ones rely too much on graphics, cheap scaring and no plot to build up the suspense and then the surprises that give you that thrill.  In a word today's thrillers are passe.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Good premise that initially grabbed my interest but the story line just got worse and worse as the movie went on, culminating in an &#34;Independence Day&#34; ripoff ending. Overall, a disappointing two hours. For Tom Cruise fanatics only.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|I wasn't crazy about the way the free version all but forced you to buy the game, but it has totally been worth the $2.  My daughter loves playing this game and gets a great sense of accomplishment from helping the characters.  Sometimes she asks for my help, but I think it's more because she likes to play it together.  She sometimes wants me to get the germs for her, but when she does it herself, she is so proud that she &#34;got those monsters.&#34;  I really do love this game.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|....and this will be one of them. You always remember the album that converted you into a fan and this is that album for me and others who only had QOTSA on the edge of their musical radar as a remnant of the immediate post-Grunge scene. I hear everything from Soundgarden and Bush to Nine Inch Nails and Foo Fighters, but what I mostly hear is a very strong collection of songs that stretch out into a variety of approaches. I had not realized just how powerful and Bowie-like Josh Homme sounded as a singer as previous albums tended to become white-washed with heavy, dingy guitar, but &#34;...Like Clockwork&#34; creates more space than any other QOTSA work; space that is left open for minimalist approaches at times, until the band opens up the valve full-blast and sounds bigger than ever. One of the best surprises of 2013.
B000J4QWMC|4.0|I love Mann's tv series and movies, but this one is a bit weak. Gong Li, on the other hand was gorgeous.
B00AYB1RGG|2.0|Not a bad shootemup with new actors.  lots of violence.  I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who abhors lots of killing or maiminh
159463176X|5.0|Love these books by Khaled, and he keeps me reading.  Can't put his books down.  This was also a great read.
B00DJYJQ36|5.0|Very different from Before 1 and 2. But they're older, love is not always as sweet as when we had experienced when we were younger. For married couples, this film totally gets it right. WATCH IT. One of the best films of 2013.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I think it is perfect for on the go and when I am doing homework or buying things to total it all out I love this app it is fairly easy to work and sometimes when I get really really really super bord I just go and play on it and it helps me remember so problems so I really love this app!!!!!!!!!'!
B0012OGCO6|4.0|This was just a fun movie to watch. Enjoyed the young characters and the story line. Basic good vs evil movie.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Watch this series. It totally lives up to the hype hype. I missed it when it was on originally, and it is essential to watch the seasons in order
B009KS4XRO|5.0|very entertaining,and good to past time great game in overall pretty fun!!! it's a steal cuz it's free!!, the game runs smooth on my KFHD
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Have loved the book, and the original musical I have seen several time.  Have also watched on PBS, the anniversary special of the production.  This was a great, great rendition of the story, and these actors went to great extremes to play the parts.  Not only losing weight for more realistic acting of their character, but my goodness, they sang with such passion and great voices.  Could not believe that Jackman had such a great voice.  Loved it, and plan to watch it more.  And, I may add, I am one that usually hates any remake of an original, but this is an exception.
B003HGKJH8|5.0|Use high quality headphones with this magnificent and dreamy recording. Very sublime and melodic.  John Lennon is finally back with a new twist!!
031620157X|5.0|My 8 year old loves to read and loves the &#34;grown up&#34; feel to this book.  It is a great bridge from the stand alone kids books to the young readers &#34;series&#34;, because it has elements she already if familiar with (i.e. fairy tales). Half way through this one she was already asking when she could get the next in the sequence.  I found the writing to be quite good without being too &#34;mature&#34; for her age/comprehension.  She also like the author is so young.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|The graphics are very good and fast. Fun tiles and backgrounds to choose from. If you like Mahjong you will love this game.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Well you've already watched season 1, right? gotta watch this before season 3, right? this amazing show created a time suck in my life, I was so eager to watch that I stayed up late before work watching, not caring how tired I'd be the next day. Watch this series
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Dublin is a great city, and everyone that been there before knows that the city is music and music is the city. A nice love-drama story of two musicians take place there.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|This is a hilarious romantic comedy suitable for family viewing, but it may require some explanation from older parents about the bomb shelter fad of the 1950s. I love everything about this movie and I would recommend it to anyone.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Vanessa Diffenbaugh has created a character in Victoria who will move you to tears while you want to shake her or slap her into some sense. I also loved Elizabeth and Grant. Greatly enjoyed the references to flowers and food.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Easy to use.  Lots of options.  I use it often.  Excellent for travel.  Well worth the price .  Very happy with this app.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|Plays almost everything perfectly.  I even like the set up of the screen.  It was very frustrating trying to view videos on YouTube on my kindle before having this app.
B002PMPTIO|4.0|Amazing how true to the original characters yet even richer in their personas BRAVO.  The second movie...okay but too long
B009MYAQK4|5.0|Although the book isn't what thought it would be it was a great read and was really insightful!! You can take a lot from this book and it leaves you in deep thought even after you're done.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game has amazing graphics!!!  The puzzles are excellent!!!  And the clues are very good because they give enough information without giving answers thereby preventing frustration but not spoiling the adventure.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|Not really my kind of book, but you do have to appreciate men like Mark Owen who are willing to sacrifice so much to assure Americans the freedoms we take for granted.
076790592X|5.0|What a sweet story...this should be required reading in high school.  Our society needs to appreciate the older citizens in our country.  Well written and leaving you wanting more.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a book that I didn't want to end. I fell in love with all of the characters and was often moved to tears by their humanity.
B00A7CI82I|1.0|This film is a waste of time. It is not in any way a continuation of the 3 stellar movies
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Wonderful movie but the volume was hard to regulate on my Kindle<br />The quality of the streaming was terrific  picture resolution clear
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|One never knows what is going to happen next.  I am very interested in season 4.  Who will be the next inline to inherit Downton Abbey?
B004SKHJF2|4.0|Very nice and accurate, runs well on my HTC ONE, very easy to use, overall quality is good and fast
B006S01GH2|5.0|The director uses special effects to portray emotions in ways ONLY possible in film media.  And, it is assumed the viewer is not an idiot that needs to have every detail explained on a simplistic level.  The story is sweet, open-ended, and a marvelous exploration of what being a modern, creative young female looks like, without the financial 'how does she support herself?' wizardry so prevalent in movies and tv.  a great movie for anyone, but especially young women.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Serves it purpose..does what it says it is going 2 do. I really like it a lot. And I'm done now..
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This series is a new love of mine.  I'm watching every episode for the second time in anticipation of a new season!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I escape when I watch it !  The very best show I've ever watched . I can hardly stand the wait for season four
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|We like this show , because the main characters are so believable, and interesting~and their supporting characters are just that ~ strong, smart, sexy. (and others whom wanna be sexy!) Very well written story lines that make you watch, and have interesting twists~we used to put the Good Wife in the better category, but this show is more true to life with LESS agenda's shoved in our face and given attention to. Suits~can't wait for more!.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Finally I am able to play the Metal Gear (MG) and Metal Gear Solid games on my PS3! The games are pretty much presented in chronological order with MG and MG2 found in the MGS3 menu and MGS included as a download. I would have preferred to have MGS on one of the discs instead of having to download it, but I believe this is to discourage buying it used (download uses a code that may be used by only one person with a PS account).<br /><br />The series follows the Metal Gear story from Big Boss's beginnings in 1964 to his genetic son's, Solid Snake, final confrontation with the Patriots, an untouchable political organization controlling world war and economies in 2014. With amazing war machines, complex story lines and \\"INCREDIBLE!!!!\\" graphics (MGS4), this series has for years set the bar for story telling and graphic realism. MGS4 garnered perfect reviews, was voted \\"Game of the Year\\" by many publications and reviewed as \\"technically flawless\\" by Gamespot.<br /><br />Re-playability value: HIGH<br /><br />MGS2 and 3 are the HD updated versions and still hold their own pretty well against newer games in terms of graphics. MG and MG2 are 8 bit games and are a real blast from the past yet surprising still challenging. All of the MGS have deep stories with good continuity having stealth being the primary focus of the game play.<br /><br />Game order chronologically is:<br /><br />Metal Gear Solid 3<br />Metal Gear Solid Peacewalker<br />Metal Gear<br />Metal Gear 2, Solid Snake<br />Metal Gear Solid<br />Metal Gear Solid 2<br />Metal Gear Solid 4<br /><br />NOT INCLUDED in this collection: (these stories were more like side missions and their absence does not subtract from the main story)<br />Metal Gear: Ghost Babel (Asia and Japan release only)<br />Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops<br />Metal Gear Solid ACID<br />Metal Gear Solid ACID 2<br />Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance
B0098756DC|5.0|John Wayne in blu-ray, still going strong<br /><br />One of his best early films! I can't wait to see more John Wayne Classics in Blu-ray, hopefully digitally re-mastered, and re-formatted to widescreen if possible. Notify me of new John Wayne Blu-ray DVDs!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I purchased this hair salon app for my 6 yr old granddaughter.  She absolutely loves it and the fact that she can regrow the hair if she makes a mistake in cutting and can color the hair as well as use hats and bows on the finished product.  I admit that I had fun playing with it as well.
B000WEMH3C|1.0|This cover is garbage.<br />Multiple problems with this cover.<br />Keeps blowing off, so I had to place a brick on top to keep it from flying away.<br />Ripping, tearing, disintegrating...<br />This thing wears like cheap paper.<br /><br />Don't bother with this, it won't even last 6 months.<br />Not the type of quality I expected from Weber.<br />Very disappointed.<br /><br />I wish I could post a picture of this piece of garbage.<br />It's literally in shreds from the wind tearing it apart.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|I really enjoy Amazon Instant movies!<br />Its very reliable and the selection of movies is great!!! Amazing and fun !!!
B009JZSC9S|3.0|With ALL the 'not so hidden agenda's', this show is good, but starting to lose our interest. It's one thing to have character with 'alternative' lifestyles', but to make us feel like we're in te 'minority'. This show has obvious intentions, and we are less than thrilled about the direction it's taking. They skirt making light of Christian beliefs, but they make you feel if you believe and are fully invested in God, that you are a 'fanatic, weird, uncool~Give us what the show is great at, acting, writing etc.<br />Still watching, but disappointed, they can strive to reach all viewers, NOT just focus on one group of people!
B003UYUR10|5.0|I love the story, humor, effects and tempo of this flick. The story telling is well paced with great actors revealing triumph, pain, laughter, revenge, jealousy, and love, in an easy to follow story that is fun for the whole family.<br /><br />I purchased the combo pack used at a price that is a steal for it entertainment value.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Truly arcade style. Kind of like shooting pool. You have to have a strategy as to where you place the coins.
B00B7VPKMY|5.0|The Eagles are a great band.  Saw them in the 60's and in the 70's.  They will always make good music.
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|I carry my kindle from room to room, like a crazy lady to watch season one.  I don't know which character I like the best they all make me laugh out loud every episode.  Absolutely, my new favorite show.  I wish I discovered it last year when it came out.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett has a way of really bringing you into his world and makes you feel like you know his characters.  I can't wait a whole year for book III!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Cleans what you need o get rid of quickly,  easily, and efficiently! I am a novice , self taught, wanna be computer geek, and this WAS NOT confusing, nor intimidating~I liked that it went  a got rid of the junk in an instant~great app!
B008UX2UIO|5.0|I grew up in New Orleans in about the same time period as the book.  for me, this is like going home.  I often wonder ahow people who are not form here, &#34;Get it.&#34;  but apparently they do.  Characters are absurd and yet familiar.  It's just so sad, we don't have more from this author.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I'm sure it has all been said before, but what a great book! I waited way too long to read Ii I know. MORE!!!
B0019NG73G|5.0|This is very well made. It does go very long, but very informative. Had some very prominent actors portraying actual civil war soldiers
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this juss plain awesome and creative. plus its a really good movie game and I enjoy it thanks for making it
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I am hooked. Recently had a 'Good Wife' marathon watching 17 episodes in two days! Well acted and Julianna Margulies is brilliant in her role; closely followed by the character Kalinda (Archie Parjabi). Best show - 5 stars.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This fine app is easy to use, and lets you know EXACTLY what you need to know is robbing you of battery strength etc.
B002ZB26AO|4.0|This is fascinating.  Humankind's innate desire to be hopeful (it will be better tommorrow) can become maladaptive in extreme circumstances.  This is the classic case. See also &#34;The Worst Hard Time&#34; for an American story with the same message.
B00338QENI|5.0|I don't think I've ever read a non-fiction book that was such a suspenseful page-turner (at least not since In Cold Blood)!  This was a very objectively written, balanced and incredibly informative book and I think it successfully communicated the complex facts involved in tissue culture, medical research, the social, political and personal dynamics of racism in America's history, and family dysfunction.  Rebecca Skloot did an excellent job and Dale Lacks was the driving spirit.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This was a pretty good movie, if you like violence and action. It's not my usual style of movie, but it was good otherwise.
B008JFUO36|5.0|Love this film so much! Never a dull moment and has several great twists, including the ending. I highly recommend it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I enjoy playing this game, it is easy and quick to play.  Great colorful graphics. Warning, it can be addicting!
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|This book seemed an open and honest tale of a man who was a genius with a purpose and a focus on achieving that purpose.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|It is something that all kids 2-6 will love you can cook all kinds of foods  highly recommended to anyone.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Having a son in the military, this is my best way to access<br />him and his family.  Thank you facebook.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|The movie plot started out a bit too slow to my taste. Otherwise, I would say it was a pretty good movie.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|The Expat was completely captivating. The description of the busy, bored family woman was excruciating, compared to the morally ambivalent, high-stake career that preceded it. The plot twists were serpentine and anxiety-provoking. I look forward to the author's next effort!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Once again Khaled Hosseini provides a touching story about love and family. If you've read ANY of his other books, you must read And the Mountains Echoed. The whole novel is extremely well written and uses multiple points of view. Follow along on a brother and sister's life long journey to reunite.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I sew all the time, so perfect for me. I love thinking games. Some are easy,but fun. Some you think you have it solved and you have to think again and sometimes again.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie was very different and most definately thought provoking. I liked it so much as to say I would see it again.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great ideas.  Being a crafter, I am enjoying looking at this site.<br />Thank you to my daughter for introducing me.
B007N31ZKQ|5.0|This movie was a replacement for one that we had lost.  Nice to have it in our movie collection again
B0070YDOT8|5.0|I love fresh deck poker my husband my son my daughter in law love fresh deck poker the best exciteing game on facebook
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|What is up with this thing I was shocked like crazy I have never seen any thing like this before all I can say is wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow
044024238X|4.0|Great book and a fun read! As a city lawyer myself, I think the book is exaggerated but not unrealistic. At one point, I also didn't know how to be domestic due to focusing on studying and work. Now I'm trying to learn how to cook and clean for my own household, and it's definitely an adventure at times! I related to Samantha's predicament and funny failed attempts. A fun lighthearted read!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This series is a great chic series.  I enjoy watching it and losing myself into the characters.  I'm looking forward to seeing every episode!
B00COGXX7A|3.0|The movie was good but it only played for 1 hour and the whole thing froze up and I was never able to see the rest of the movie, a wasted $4.99.
0786890754|1.0|I watched the movie a couple of years ago, and it was such a touching story.  It's still a good story in the book but the writing is just so cheesy (and I'm having a hard time sugar-coat it here).  I tried a couple of times and just couldn't finish it.  It was really a struggle to proceed reading it.<br /><br />On the other hand, maybe it's not the writing; maybe I'm just not a target audience for this book.  The author was in her early 20s when she wrote the book.  I'm a woman in my early 30s, so I could easily fall off the radar of the target market.  If I were to read and write a review of a romance book, it wouldn't be good either because I'm just not into it.
0060873175|4.0|I love all things &#34;Michael Crichton&#34;.  The book was very fast-paced, a real page turner. And suitable readers of all ages. Very entertaining.
0307476073|5.0|Once I started it, I couldn't put it down. It is very well written with a lot of great soul searching and insight.<br /><br />I am a hiker, so I found it very interesting - never realized the PCT was so difficult in many areas!<br /><br />Cheryl wore leather hiking boots. I think there are far superior materials these days, and so much greater comfort.<br />Too bad she had such miserable foot problems.<br /><br />I wonder if she's still hiking!
B0090X4GLW|4.0|And it has a catchy tune. Hey, if you're all about Zumba this CD would be good for that too! Nice mixes of songs make it good for anyone to enjoy.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|I enjoy the game a lot. The graphics are great for a free game. The game would be 5 stars if it wasn't for the gem system which requires real cash total bummer.  Also the wait time for upgrades gets absolutely ridiculous as in all night.
0399159347|5.0|I have never read this author before.  I could not put the book down.  It grabed me from the start.  The book really makes you stop and think about how you would react to these same situations if they happened in your life.  This book is very realistic and you found yourself wanting to help each character.  The characters were very real.  I would have liked to hear more about Will and Felicity situation when Tess left.  That was the only area that had me wanting more detail.  Great read!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I was about to pass this one up since my phone and Tab both have keywords, but I was convinced to get it by my wife. Now it is the only keyboard I use.
B00BFBBN3G|1.0|It is another great movie by Ang.  Our issue is with the defective DVD which stalled at the 67 minute mark.
B003E6LC6I|4.0|I had to come back to this season to be able to relate to the final seasons. There are many scenes in the whole series that are forward and backward in time, for me it was confusing when I did not understand which time frame the character's were living. If you have watched &#34;Twin Peaks&#34;  you may understand my confusion.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|Just happened onto this Amazon suggestion while purchasing then new Sabbath and Alice in Chains. Give it a try good stuff<br />Jim
0316153907|5.0|Added this book to a collection I'm buying of his books. /Easy to read and easy to follow plot. thanks for sending the books in such good condition a pleasure to buy from you .
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I found this to be a very difficult game to play. I could not find where there were hints if I could not find the objects. I deleted after trying.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|JJ Abrams caught the feeling of the late seventies here.<br />This time period was personal for me. We were breaking away from what was standard for our society, standing our ground without being out there.<br />You can see Spielberg's influence in the kids and their relationships.<br />It's a can't miss movie.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Game was a lot of fun. Great graphics. Great to take to bed,<br />like a good book hard to put down. Four stars!!!!!
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|I got to see this show live in Los Angeles, it was such an amazing show, it's a must see concert. I got the DVD since everyone on here is saying the bluray is defected, so far for me the DVD looks great it was meant to look like a movie with special new features that they never had used in concerts. I wish the DVD would have been recorded in a more natural way like back in the 80's and 90's. but I'm still happy there was a release. to me the DVD looks great and has great audio buy the DVD. I can't say much for the bluray cause I'm not sure if that one is really defected.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|like I said in the title it is ok it is a bruce willis movie and they all have the same theme
B009WO7NQO|1.0|This game is great but since I did the update for 30 moons of endor, the entire game will not load. Unable to play any of it.
B000HZD168|5.0|If you saw space seed, the original episode starring Ricardo Montalban then you have to have the Wrath of Khan.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B009GX69RK|5.0|Omg. This show is the best show I have seen in a long time. The acting is perfect and I literately watched all of season 2 in one sitting. I can't wait for season 3!
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|I did not know of him before I got this but it was good. great songs that make you think...
0525952926|3.0|He writes this book as if writing for teenagers, like for a history class.  It's interesting, but I feel like Follett is writing it for an audience that is not that bright!  A good history lesson, a bit of a soap opera, bit a bit disappointing.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Its a great program you get into every show I would recommend it to anyone it keeps you hooked so you want to watch the next show
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It's been a long time since I stayed up until my eyes could barely focus, for just One. More. Chapter. It was a welcome change. Not the empty teenage love story mush I expected, but instead, like Orson Scott Card's, a real story with layers of love, politics, war, and the human beings who have to survive it all.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|This game has lots of bugs. The more you play the less stable it appears to be.<br />I would avoid it and keep shopping.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This storyline took so many twisted turns. Couldn't put it down. Amy. Nick. Go.  Andie.  I couldn't take much more. What a roller coaster.
B004H4XDBI|3.0|I really enjoyed how this book went back and forth in time. I loved how they were finally able to clear the air and they needed to be apart for them to truly succeed in music.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Not your typical SEAL book, this man had the toughest fight of his life against heroin and drugs.  It probably made what he did in combat easier and not as frightening.
B005XN31LY|5.0|We watch movies together in the evenings.  I've been following this series since the beginning.  A couple of weeks ago I introduced my nephew to Once Upon A Time.....I also introduced my sister-in-law and her daughter to the series.  We all watch it now.  It's a blast!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show. I am invested in the characters and can't wait to watch the next season. Historical Drama at its best.
193700788X|2.0|I have read all of this series and this book was just ok to me. I am not really happy where it left off I guess. I wanted more. But overall I love the series and am an avid Trueblood HBO fan too.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book had great reviews so I decided to read it and they were right! Had me hooked until the very last page. Great story line, great character development. Definitely would recommend this
B005CVWWJY|5.0|What a great book. A must ready for every nerd and sci fi fan and lover of the 80s. The book has an amazing pace. At times it moves so fast you cannot stop and feel breathless and amazed at the end.<br />Robotech fans might like this as well....
B007EC27QM|3.0|Would have liked to have the ability to add additional people instead of just one. Maybe I need to learn more about it.
B00EVCD9HY|4.0|Overall great album, a few songs overshadow others but thats nit-picking great from good! The song with Prince and the last track on the album are my favorites. She seems to be expanding her musical range with every album and I'm def. along for the ride.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was a lot of fun me and my three year old played it together he loved opening the boxes and remembering the sequences.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this series. Sorry but no one does this type of drama the way the Brits do! its a hard act to follow. The people seem so real not like US drama with more botox there real people real face not ashamed to show yes I am young or mid aged or old it adds to story if you see people playing parts made for them and their age. I now have watched all three of the Downton Abbey series and would said if you like a good drama with a little fun on the side, get a cup of tea, tissues, cookies go to bed have a PJ day and enjoy.
B008MM9630|5.0|Fairy Farm is a great game. It is a game of strategy for sure. You really have to watch your timing and maintain it well.
B005EPFA8I|1.0|I didn't enjoy this film, and found it very dull. I fell asleep during the film. I would recommend if you have a cup of coffee with you.
B00594XOZU|1.0|This app is useless. It doesn't work with my Kindle Fire and is not user friendly. Tech support is useless at best. I deleted it
0545265355|5.0|Awesome box set. Gave it to my teenage daughter and she tore through them in a couple of weeks. After which I had to read them. Looking forward to &#34;Catching Fire&#34; movie release November 2013. Thanks
B0007IF5GO|5.0|The kitchen goes very well with other calico critter furniture, hours of fun for my kids, very happy with the purchase.
B008Y768XO|3.0|The story is old.  The real dog died in the 1930's.  They did a great job of modernizing the story, with contemporary settings, etc. The relationship between dog and owner portrayed well. However, I hoped to be inspired and awed.  Instead, I literally cried the whole second half of the movie.  The story portrays the dog as loyal to the utmost.  He went to the train station to wait on his master who had died every day for 10 years at 5 o'clock.  The family gave the dog chances to live with the owner's daughter and family, who he knew. Instead, he chose a lonely, desolate existence with minimal human contact.  I wouldn't call that loyal.  That's depression.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game surprisingly is lots of fun additives and interactive. Great for mature ages. This is bringing the casino to you home in a welcoming way.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|It help me out greatly thank you so much for the item will be shopping for more items soon Thank You
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Chromecast doesnt work with chrome browser on iphone.<br /><br />Google clearly states that it works with Chrome browser.I guess they were trying to convey that it works with windows pc or mac chrome browser.<br /><br />I bought it thinking that I would be able to play through chrome browser on my iphone.<br /><br />APPLE is way better at what it promises and delivers with no gimmicks<br /><br />BTW GOOGLE-LEARN FROM APPLE
0606318860|5.0|School edition has the hard back covers, easy large text to read. After reading it, I donated to my daughter's school. Should be pretty popular as the November 1st movie release approaches.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I saw the movie in 2011 and I really liked it. I definitely enjoyed the book more. It was slow in the beginning but I couldn't stop reading. Entertaining and exciting! I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I HATE working out so much. This dvd is great though. The way the workout is set up in circuits make it to where as soon as you feel like you're going to die, that move is done and you're on to the next thing. I could tell a difference in how my clothes fit in the first week of doing it everyday.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|It's very dark but I loved it!!!! If you are looking for humor.........don't watch! I wanted to see this movie as soon as I saw it advertised
140006922X|4.0|I really enjoyed the book, and made me understand the social situation at time of Jesus. Being a non believer, this book confirmed some of my previous thought and give an explanation of some which I did not give and answer.<br />Definitely I will give it to my mum (strong beleiver).
B0091REZMW|3.0|Fun so far. I like that you can become friends with people in the game and you don't need to be connected to Facebook.
159315724X|5.0|The Compound Effect is a great learning tool!  I like how he has work sheets to do.  It really makes you think!
0316017930|5.0|The condition said new and it absolutely is. Great book and I highly recommend reading it if you are thinking about it. Quick shipment and cheaper than the stores.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I was immediately pulled into this story, the author has a way of making each and every character so alive, I wanted to know each and every one of them!!!
1416955070|5.0|Love it! But the movie was horrid...but don't worry if you love to read, you will love it!! I promise
B00CDT41RY|2.0|If something is going to turn me off to the least bit of historical, this would be it. Obviously an outdated spaghetti western. If there's a statement to be made in here, it's lost with all the wrong and misleading items that would build a half way decent plot.
0061122416|3.0|I found this book to be relatively entertaining.  It was a quick read that I didn't get bored with.  However, I didn't find any of its messages to be profound.  This book has been made out to be something with life's hidden secrets but it doesn't offer anything that most people don't already know and understand.  It simply lays it out in a simplistic manner.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I only hope there will be more seasons - It followed the known norse sagas very well and the cast was very engaging.
B008469DGY|1.0|This isn't golf.  It's a &#34;try to get a hole in one&#34; game.  Fortunately, it was a free week pickup, but I still uninstalled it after playing one hole.<br /><br />Other than it not actually being a golf game, the graphics are quite nice.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|My daughter and I wanted to watch this and we both really enjoyed. By the end of the movie the entire family was in tune to it.
B00B99KJR0|2.0|Ugh. I like match 3 games, but when they are rigged to defeat you, the fun factor goes down drastically. At first, it is not too challenging, almost boring, but then as you get into the higher levels, it becomes VERY hard to beat the clock. I don't care much for the power-ups, and you don't have any different ones to choose from.  The power-up is earned by making 4+ matches and if you don't use it right away it will change to something more &#34;powerful&#34;, but not necessarily more useful. I don't recommend this for anyone looking to play for relaxation.
B006C45MRE|4.0|The title seems to want to lead me away from watching this. It works. And of course the hero rides off into the sunset in the end. Typical of course. I'd recommend this for some good fun in watching.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|I liked this a lot more than I thought I would. It's a fun movie with a great cast that keeps you entertained the entire time. Not a remake or a sequel like every other movie coming out these days.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Never imagined using my Kindle Fire much yet now using it all the time! I can thank World At Arms for this. The only real issue I have ever had is the bases both ally and enemy failing to load so I would lack hearts. Even with said issue this game is too much fun!!! Get u some! Let's Roll!!!
0525478817|5.0|The Fault In Our Stars is hard to describe because it has so many literary elements done so very very well. It is a very funny, very realistic, very sad story of three teenagers who are living with cancer. It's a story about having cancer, but is not the least bit sappy, and the usual cancer cliches (..is a fighter, gone to a better place, etc.) are only used, (very humorously) to illustrate how silly and not at all comforting these kinds of comments are. The three main characters are not perfect cancer fighting heroes, but they are heroes when they need to be. Mostly, they are very smart, very kind, normal teenagers who don't even bother wishing for a normal life because they know it is not going to happen until the cancer is conquered. Gus, Hazel and Isaac meet in a support group for teens with cancer. Even though none of them likes attending, they go in case someone in the groups needs them to be there and because it eases their parents grief and stress a little. They are also desperate for true, meaningful friendships. Their healthy friends, from pre-cancer days, are too disconnected from what is happening to them to be more than acquaintances. Of course in a realistic teen story, there needs to be romance. Gus, Hazel and Isaac recognize that in any relationship that includes cancer can not be a normal relationship. Not only might it be doomed, all three of the teens worry about the impact their possible death may have on someone who loves them. Thanks to John Green's outstanding writing, this too, is dealt with realistically, humorously, heart-breakingly, and compassionately. Every teenager (and adult) will love Isaac, Gus and Hazel and will love this book.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|This is a cute book, nothing too exciting but good to take for a weekend trip or read on the plane.
B00BW5K5DO|4.0|This is still a fun time management game on Kindle. This has different versions of the levels, so it's like a new Royal Envoy game. I am enjoying playing it as much as I did on my PC. Royal Envoy is one of those great time management games you don't get bored playing over and over.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Great way to re-introduce old friends. I like the characters. I hope they make at least as many films as they did episodes of the first Star Trek.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|OMG I LOVE THIS APP IT IS AMAZING I NEVER GET BORED. IT IS GREAT TO PLAY IF YOU hAVEN'T PLAYED YOU ARE NOT COOL.
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|The graphics in this game are actually very surprising.  Very nice HD quality display.  The Game play is pretty good as well and should be fun to play for a while.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I loved the Harry Potter books and sort of expected not to like her shift in genre. The story line is comletely different but after just a few pages, the characters were completely real and alive and the story engrossing. She has not lost her touch - I came away a true believer in J.K. Rowling's ongoing ability to spin a story !
0307341577|5.0|I love this book! It was so fun to read with a ton of twists and that you never see coming. Wish I could read it again for the first time!
B004RQDQIQ|5.0|I'm a big fan of most of the Coen brothers' films, but this is one of my favorites. The period &#34;feel&#34; of this film, the acting, Gabriel Bryne's character, the dialogue, and the sets all work together wonderfully. This is a different film than &#34;Fargo&#34; or &#34;Blood Simple,&#34; but it's just as great as those.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I thought I'd be turned off by someone other than Shatner playing Kirk. These guys make memories of the original come alive. Special effects certainly has come a long way.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Good...........................Good.I.likewise it very co-op and the mark on this one was a good thing for the market and a good idea
B007EC27QM|5.0|Perfect for all my  needs. I love the size that appears on my Kindle fire<br />Very easy for me to use and see the numbers.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|A wonderful new talent!Unique singing style and fantastic guitar playing for someone so young. Has his own sound. Can&#34;t wait for his next CD!
B00CTT9646|4.0|Got my new phaser today! It really is cool to hold. I'm giving it a 4 stars because it's only a display model. I had forgotten about that part when I purchased it. The only moving part on this phaser is the barrel for \\"stun\\" or \\"kill\\" modes. Nothing else is functional. Its weight feel good when handling it.<br />It look really nice on the black display. It's a center of conversation when guest comes to the house. They like to hold it and mess around with it. I can't say much about the 3D movie yet, due to not having a 3D TV. That on my list. I would recommend the set to those that want to just collect and have a model that has the \\"real feel\\" of a phaser. If you really want to have a functional one, you will have to wait a few more years for that to happen..lol
0812971825|2.0|I was disappointed in this book. I think Elizabeth Strout is a terrific author, but this book just never opened itself up to me, for whatever reason. I kept asking myself what was bothering me about the book, but had trouble coming up with an answer. However, I thought the issue with the child, Katherine, was never truly explored. We saw symptoms, but I never felt like there was an actual diagnosis or answer to what her difficulties were.
B009GX6AKQ|5.0|I have to say, I wasn't sold on watching this show when it first aired.  I'm not really sure why it just didn't spark an interest.  I'm so glad I decided to start season 1.  New girl is one of the funniest shows on TV.  The witty banter, Zooey's adorable outfits and quirkiness and then there's Schmidt.  All the actors mesh amazing together and it creates a hilariously fun show to watch.  I would recommend this show to everyone!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I was &#34;hooked&#34; after the 1st episode of Season 1.  Love the costumes, old cars, art and antiques.  Can't wait for season 4.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|Died after three weeks. I was surprised that it was from Amazon and it still died. I made sure the kids didn't cause too much stress to it...to no avail. Won't charge.
0385738765|4.0|The Scorch Trials is the sequel to James Dashner's award winning Maze Runner and the second book in the trilogy. Although the book isn't as mysterious as its predecessor, The Scorch Trials is full of the fan-loving suspense, shocking plot twists, and lovable characters, or Gladers as they are called in the book. The Scorch Trials will keep you turning pages worried for the lives of every character as if it were your own.<br /> In the plot the Gladers have finally escaped the maze and think that their troubles are done, but things quickly go downhill and the Gladers soon find themselves back into harm's way fighting for their lives in the Scorch, which is full of deadly lightning storms and flesh eating cannibals. Thomas, the returning protagonist, doesn't know who he can or can't trust which is possibly the hardest trial of all.<br /> The book is loaded with tons of action packed events that will have you on the edge of your seat. Whether the Gladers are running from decapitating metal ooze, or fighting the zombie like Cranks, the action in this book will get your adrenaline pumping.<br /> The charismatic and diverse characters in The Scorch Trials are the best part of the book. You will see some of your favorites from the first book return, like the sarcastic leader Minho, but you will also meet some new people including Brenda, the intelligent and overly friendly character. These characters allow for some unpredictable and gut wrenching plot twists that will blindside you throughout the book.<br /> The Scorch Trials is one of the books you will want to finish in a late night read-a-thon. It is a great sequel and Dashner has done a great job again. If you are a fan of the sci-fi young adult genre I highly recommend this book.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Much different from the usually love story or detective novel that I normally read. The pages flew by from start to finish. I will read more from this author.
B00CWVA3SE|5.0|I could not believe the work put into this movie.<br /><br />With all its limitations its full of action and very clever humor.<br /><br />My boy loved it.<br /><br />The Hi Def transfer is quite good...  Perfect for large screen and large speakers!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Very entertaining and the chemistry between the lead characters makes the show so exceptional.  Can't wait to continue into Season 2!
B00C7L8DM2|3.0|It's in the mold of  &#34;Taken&#34; where a father who just happens to be an ex-spy moves to Europe with his teenage daughter to work for a high tech security firm but is duped and then left out in the cold and on the run. Eckhart gives a good performance. I would say it was worth the rent.
B0019IB0II|4.0|For anyone who has a stroke or for many others on a personal/spiritual growth path.  An enjoyable book with which won't be forgotten.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I cannot wait for the new season to start!  This is a great series and I am always so sad when it ends.  This was a shocker of an ending but I am sure the new season will bring new characters and excitement again!
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|This album was made for me on demand since it's not officially available for purchase in the us. I'm extremely happy with the cd. It includes the full concert ! You won't be disappointed.
0375842209|5.0|A great book. Cannot wait to see the movie. It is very powerful and will sweep you to a very troubled time in our world history.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The story is getting better and better, even though I hate the way this season ends I realize it will keep story alive. Just a wonderful look at how the world all changed for a specific group of people in England, and Maggie Smith what more can you ask for ever but please give Bates a chance to smile this year.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|I have been waiting for this movie to come out and it was well worth the wait.  I enjoy watching zombie movies and this was a pretty good movie.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I find this show extremely entertaining and fun.  I tend to watch more episodes per evening than planned, due to its fascination.  Definitely recommend! - it's totally enjoyable.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Ordered this unit plus the 5 port ac charger and the 2 port car charger. They all work great and are small enough to carry around in a fanny pack or purse. Completed charging my phone 7 times before the unit showed only 1 light left. A full charge for the battery took 7 1/2 hours. You can charge 2 items at the same time.
B00DM0XXCM|4.0|This film is pretty crazy. It is not the easiest to follow but it is super! What an imagination the writer had! I think it is one of the craziest of sci-fi movies I have seen.
0143124544|5.0|an amazing book. it made me laugh and cry and think. I am eager to read more by this author
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I got the new update but now when you go into a world it takes you out of the game completely.  Please FIX!
0345529057|5.0|I bought these for my boyfriend's birthday because I got him into the show but he's never read the books and I was tired of explaining things to him lol. Needless to say, he loved them and is hard at literary escapism as we speak. These were a great value, I wish they had a 5 book set but oh well.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The writing isn't great but it's an interesting story and very kinky! Anastasia starts out very whiney but eventually she gets over it. And then theres Christian, handsome, wealthy, disturbed Christian. These books are a must read at least once!!
B002YOKVU4|4.0|Yep.  Drugs, Vegas, Hunter.  Just what the Doctor ordered.  It's a movie worth watching at least once.  Depp is an amazing actor.  Movie is packed with names.
B00E8B1358|4.0|This film is great! It takes you from the former G.I. Joe and yet doesn't follow it so closely that you know what's coming. It did give me the feel however that as one major character is killed that they were going to bring him back somehow later? I didn't like the fact they never did. It should have been a little more definite a death. Unless that is they are leaving it open to bring him back in a later saga. Who knows?
B0067Q42BY|2.0|Too difficult to get game to launch...too many interruptions from ads!! Which is my biggest complaint with my new Kindle HD!!! Nowhere can I find out how to eliminate constant ads.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I loved it! I'm telling everyone at my job about it, Best series yet. I'm looking forward to the Second Season.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I love this book so much it's weird. Hahaha I read this book in 3days because I couldn't put it down. If you're a girl looking for a NON cheesey, LOVE filling and HEART racing romance book....THIS is it!!!! My new favorite book
B000G7PNAE|4.0|Different but the more I listen to it the better I like.  Wish it didn't repeat so many of their hits.  Get tired of culling repeats from my collection. krf
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is super fun I beat the game in about 2 hours but I wish their was more  balloons
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Definitely the first book is the best one. It almost feels as though there has no closure in this trilogy.
B002WIDRM6|3.0|do I like. &#34;Need You Now&#34; is wonderful. Other than that it's average. Wish I'd previewed the cd....my fault I guess.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I hated temple run, and this game plays in a similar manner, but those minions are so damn cute I can't help but play this game.  I would give this five stars, buuuut they recently changed the menu and the levels I have unlocked are now blocked when I start the game.  I cannot begin from those levels and can only get to the them once I have played each area long enough.  Why did I play so much to unlock the levels if I can't start with them?!  If it was changed back I would update it to five stars.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|really love the magic games but it wont even download on my kindle and I cant delete it. I cant even get anymore apps for my kindle anymore. This needs to be fixed IMMEDIATELY. WHY IS IT ON THE MARKET IF IT DOESNT WORK?
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|I like listening to this a lot and I'm glad it doesn't disappoint at all. I'm still in love with archandroid :)
B00555X8OA|4.0|Great read. Very thought provoking and engaging. It's interesting to think about how we react with our world and what influences our decisions.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|I remember hearing \\"All the Right Moves\\", \\"Apologize\\" and \\"Secrets\\" on the radio multiple times when I was younger and never really thinking about who sung them or performed them, just that I really loved hearing them. These guys really have a different, unique style and flow to their music. And where do I start with Ryan?!? His voice is just that of an angel and very moving. I had to buy this album immediately when I finally realized that these songs and others where made by OneRepublic. Really good sophomore album;) I even got my brother to start listening to this album (he loves \\"Secrets\\") and \\"Native\\" also worth checking out!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Incredible season! Wish people didn't have to die but the characters are so strong that all will continue. I've watched this season on PBS so am really looking forward to seeing it all together on my time!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse has all the features of mice twice as expensive.<br /><br />I've been using it now for a couple months and have had zero issues. The weight of the mouse is a little light, but feels good. The four different DPI settings and complete button customization is nice.
B00BB8Q1RQ|4.0|Good Movie although it will bring tears to your eyes.<br />Heartfelt and eye opening.<br />The performances were beautiful.<br />Good to watch on a rainy day or with a friend.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This was a wonderfully and simply written yet deep, and intricate story. The book mainly focuses on Andrew &#34;ender&#34; Wiggin and his relationship to his sister Valentine whom he loves deerly and his sadistic older brother who bullies and tortures him throughtout his early childhood.<br /><br />The setting of course is the future and Ender as well as his brother and sister are genetically engineered geniuses vying for a spot in battle school where they will be trained to fight the Buggers. The Buggers are an alien race of buglike creatures who years before invaded earth, left before they fully destroyed it but, now are the bane of all earths governments & their citizens' fears.<br /><br />I won't go further into the story to avoid spoilers but I will say if you are a science fiction aficionado like me this si a definitive work and a modern classic in my eyes. The Halo books as well as other recent science fiction works obviously borrow from this story and with good reason.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|Doesn't work properly after the recent update. Shuts down constantly. I'm really not trying to re-install this after having not only paid for it, but also how much I have accomplished already.
B0084FMA56|4.0|I wear an 8 wide woman's  shoe. At times (this is an example) I find that a men's 7 medium is better than the struggle to find a woman's shoe that will fit.
B00E3M477S|5.0|In  Being  a  bass  player  that  being  said  .  her  voice  is  pretty  kick  ass  .  I  wish  I  could  jam  with  her  and  show  her  a  whole  other  world  of  music  .  I  would  like  to  take  her  over  the  top. Keep  singing  darling  Jesus  loves  you  and  always  will  .  Amen
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for season 4.<br />The ending was so sad.....don't worry, I won't give it away! If you haven't seen it,<br />watch the entire series. You will be hooked!
B00007E8UG|1.0|I am being asked to rate this cd, and I absolutely LOVE Diana Krall's silky vocals, however, since the cd that I recieved was called an 'SAcd', it was totally unplayable!  I would have NEVER placed an order for this 'type' of cd since I have no way of listening to it!  But, Diana Krall is definately one of my favorite vocalists!
B004JHYRAE|1.0|Extremely irresponsible to publish such a book when the state of the art is not conclusive. Moreover, this book may lead a lot of unstable / emotionally incompetent people to wrong conclusions about themselves. I want to emphasize, I have nothing against the polyamorous comunity.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|This is not your \\"normal\\" book of poetry.  Instead is an unique blend of intrigue, erotica, passion, and vision.  The author is remarkably talented based on how he chooses his words and paints a colorful picture to the imagination.  The way it's written is definitely not distasteful but definitely has your interest peaked and maintained throughout. I would  love to hear him deliver his work in person.  If you are looking for something \\"different\\" as far as poetry goes, this is your book.
B00D3XAA4M|2.0|too short it was just a list of activities very dissatisfying.  I generally was unimpressed. A waste of time. Too general.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|awesome time killer. I love minions and so this is great. only 4 stars because I think all upgrades should have a banana price....some upgrades I will never get because I am NOT paying real money inside a game.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of the best books I've read in my life. It has love passion and a lot more. I would recommend this book to my friends
0307744434|2.0|I hate reviewing a book that I never finished. And apparently I am one of the few in the universe who is swimming against the crowd here. This book has been all the rage, popping up everywhere from grocery store check out lines to bookstore end caps.  It looked intriguing, the cover was beautiful, and so I had to give it a try.  It was a fail. It is hard to say where it went wrong. I was so uninterested in how it turned out I couldn't even finish it.  I have a wide and varied taste in books and I really, really wanted to like this book.<br /><br />In theory it sounded so perfect. A magical circus that appears and disappears, a doomed love, a magical duel.  Mystery, magic, romance, the cover, the title. All elements that I love. I could almost see moonlight and magic and passion and love glimmering from the book cover. But I don't like jumping on bandwagons.  I didn't want to read a book just because it was the 'it' book of the moment.  Those always seemed to go bad. It is like the Emperor's New Clothes. But the book called to me and finally I picked it up.  And was soo disappointed.  It didn't even live up to it's cover.<br /><br />The writing was poetic, the idea thoughtful, but the execution was a bit too engineered and in the end I just didn't care enough.  The characters were too poetic and too varied that the author struggled to give them enough humanity.  There were just too many characters with too many mysterious auras following them around to get to the real people. Even the main characters were too mysterious to care about. The execution was too thoughtful almost to the point I could see the author struggling to make a masterpiece without really understanding what she was making. Like if she put in enough poetic words and phrases into the book it would overcome the reader and they would fall into a reader's coma of ecstasy where they wouldn't question anything.  And apparently it worked because people are raving about this book.  Maybe I missed something.I wish I could have cared more. Maybe I will care more when the movie comes out. This book would make beautiful eye candy.

B00CL66FEQ|1.0|Terrible Terrible movie - extremely disappointed - The overall movie was terrible -  a road trip accross the United States ? The movie plot was extremely poor
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|Seems Paramount chose to screw over it's customer base by splitting the special features among various retailers . Thus making them all rip-offs. Unless you buy three or more merchant versions you don't get the bonus material prepared for this movie. Expecting Paramount to do the same with [[ASIN:B00DHRLK84 World War Z (Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy)]] , I just voted with my pocketbook and cancelled my pre-order.

0307913090|4.0|The King's Hand, Lord Arryn, has died, and Eddard Stark is chosen by his good friend, the King of Westeros himself, Robert, to take Lord Arryn's place. It's not a position he wants, but one he feels called to take - and to find out how and why Lord Arryn died. Meanwhile, the Targaryen siblings, Viserys and Daenerys, make an alliance with the Dothraki people when Dany marries Drogo with the goal of taking back Westeros.<br /><br />(Let me just say, writing that plot summary was TOUGH. Not only did I have to scour Wiki for all the names and connections - because I listened to the audiobook - but I also had to figure out how to \\"dilute\\" the story to its barest elements so it didn't become five miles long.)<br /><br />I was probably one of the last people on the planet who has neither seen an episode of the HBO series nor read any of the books. I honestly never thought I'd start up this series; there are loads of fantasy series I've been somewhat interested in starting (Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time, Terry Brook's Shannara series, Raymond Feist's Magician series, and Goodkind's Sword of Truth series are only a few of the ones) and never got enough guts to actually try to start the massive 10+ book series.<br /><br />But EVERYONE was talking about this series, about how good it was, the plot twists, the characters, the story, etc. And so, I finally broke down and got the audiobook.<br /><br />The version I had was narrated by Roy Avers (I initially thought it was Robert Avery, but my memory is terrible, apparently!). He does a good enough job - telling the story well, with emotion and some distinct voices. He isn't of the same caliber as, say, Davina Porter or John Glover or Ron Perlman or Sandra Burr pre-Shelters of Stone, but he's definitely better than the others I've heard, reading their lines, apparently bored out of their minds.<br /><br />But what really stunned me was Martin's skill. He created these three-dimensional, flawed characters, set them about in this world (with their own misconceptions and misunderstanding the situation that is obvious to the readers) and lets them go. It's obvious he has a plan for where this is going, but it feels so organic, as the characters follow that path to the end.<br /><br />Favorite characters include Catelyn, Sansa, Daenerys, Eddard, and Tyrion. Even my lesser favorites, such as Arya and Bran, are still well-drawn characters, fascinating in their thoughts and interactions with others. All the characters are unique; all of them have their own personalities; all of them are strong and weak in their own way.<br /><br />THIS is how you construct characters - particularly female characters. Some authors think that to make a strong female character, you must squeeze her in tight leather and put two swords in her hands, as she unemotionally fights a wall of bad guys. This is not the world of A Game of Thrones. Catelyn is a different woman from Sansa who is different from Arya who is different from Daenerys who is different from Lysa and so on and so forth. Each one is strong in her own right, whether it be for fighting skills, wisdom, strength of character, or some other skill.<br /><br />The story, as I touched on above, is well crafted. Martin doesn't force events to happen, but it's still obvious he has a plan. His world also makes sense - sure, it could be confusing to a newbie, like myself, because it is so lacking on the fantasy element, but I think that's part of its charm. We get so inundated with fantasy, that backing off on those elements gives us more guts, more raw emotion. If someone dies in these books, we don't think, \\"Ah, he'll be back in a couple pages.\\" No, my friends, he is DEAD. Dead as dead can be dead.<br /><br />For people who are entertaining the thought of reading, take heed: there is violence in this book. There is sex. There is some language, such as the dropping of the c-word. In some places, it's pretty raw and gruesome; even the scenes that aren't explicit can be difficult to swallow, such as the talk of rape and brutal murders. But never once did I think Martin was condoning it. I thought he was merely showing these people as they were: the good parts AND the bad parts. He didn't use the rape device cheaply, as I've seen numerous times, but he also didn't shy away from using it at all. Just a warning, in case you are uneasy of such things.<br /><br />Lots of praise - so why no five stars? I'm holding out on that fifth star because I feel that Martin has more in store for this series, because I don't want to cap it out at 5 and expect every subsequent one to keep that rating, and because I don't feel like passing out my 5 stars too eagerly. But regardless of that final star, this was a great book, very entertaining and enjoyable. I can't wait to watch the HBO series and I am eager to start on Book 2.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S. Light*e difficult to swallow, such as the talk of rape and brutal murders.

B008K6HN8I|5.0|Seriously, why didn't our Kindle come with this pre-installed? Since Android is so goofy to use in the first place, a simple file navigator like this is essential.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I purchased the omnibus edition of this first series, and am honestly sad that I was unaware of it until now..I think it would have been exciting to read each segment as it came out-anticipating a new release and then hungrily devouring it piece by piece!  That said, I am also thrilled that I had the entire series sitting here in my best friend and buddy, my Kindle! Once this story starts to roll, it is hard to put down. I did have a difficult time warming up to Juliette, she just feels so cold and hard to me..hopefully this will change as I move into the next series...Finished Wool late last night and downloaded SHIFT first chance I had this am!
0399213015|5.0|I had no idea this book and the font would be soo small. It was a fun ready for my little son but since he wears glasses that font size has been a bit of a challenge. I would ensure a large print for anyone willing to purchase this book.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Well this was chosen for our community read.  I enjoyed it, it certainly doesn't take long to read.  I think it could have been a little more mysterious and clandestine.
B0034G4OWW|5.0|My husband and I laughed so much we were crying.  Great DVD.  Would recommend it to anyone young and old.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|It needs to let you be able to let you highlight pages and Mark certain places in the book so you can find it easier and. Put in a search bar so you can search the word you are looking for.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|It is a good movie but it raises some questions as to the original series. But I enjoyed it and look forward to future movies.
0375842209|5.0|If you only like conventional books that are easy to read and don't stretch your mind, you will not like this book.<br />This is not an easy book, in any aspect.  Liesel and her brother are on their way to a foster home when her brother dies.  This is Liesel's first encounter with death, and with theft, but it will not be her last.  It's 1939 Germany.  Her father has already disappeared from her life, and her mother is giving up her children to a foster home.  Rosa, her foster mother, is brusk and swears all the time, but Hans, her faster father is wonderful.  He plays the accordion.  Liesel is just starting to settle in to life with the Hubermans when everything changes.<br />This book is narrated by death.  I'm not giving anything away, because it's in the first chapter, but a lot of people do not like this use of an omniscient narrator.  I think Zusak's use of Death is brilliant, and it fits the time and the place perfectly.  Death was everywhere.  Additionally, we do not get many books about the citizens of Germany at this time.  I think it is because it is so hard for us to face the fact that normal, everyday, good people knew nothing of what was going on, and most did nothing against what they saw.  But the thing I like most about Zusak's book is that he understands the power of words.  Words can create a world.  Words can build a nation up, and destroy a people. Hitler was a master of words. Hitler never killed anyone with his own hands, but his words slaughtered millions.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|I love this series. We will be looking to buy even more seasons of the Mentalist. Well written, with a touch of humor.
B00D6MJOAQ|5.0|BOC has become a large part of the soundtrack of my life. When I heard the news that this album was coming out, I was thrilled. Play it when you're feeling introspective. It's a little harder than Campfire Headphase, but like other BOC albums, is sprinkled with moments of aching beauty.
B000I3P3EM|4.0|Love the old crew of the Enterprise.  This was their final movie and I think it was good, funny, and a nice way to end.  Christopher Plummer was a great &#34;Chang&#34;.  Story was good.  I also liked Kim Cattrall as a Vulcan.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I enjoy the fact that there wasn't a ton of sexual stuff in it and not a lot of blood, but still kept the fact that the Vikings were a very brutal group.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Its the mini version of the greatest time waster known to mankind... What else can one say about this hit!!
B0001I55SS|5.0|really great movie to watch.  weird and spacy but still takes you to a place most movies can't.  i recommend buying it.
B00CA9Y6Q8|5.0|This CD has been in constant rotation since I purchased it! I love the live instruments and the amazing arrangements. This is nothing like the \\"stuff\\" you hear on the radio and boy am I glad! My favorites are \\" Father, Father\\",\\"Make Me Lovely\\", \\"Green Garden\\" and \\" I Don't Know What the Weather Will Be\\". This cd is definitely a must have for \\"real\\" music lovers.

B0084AZXKK|4.0|We read to our 8 year old and she is getting more interested in books other than the &#34;little kids books&#34; and she really enjoyed it.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is a very good book.  It is not just a biography of Lincoln, but a biography of the times.  It is about Lincoln and the other great men and women who led the nation into and through the civil war.  It made me realize that most of what I thought I new about Lincoln and the events surrounding the civil war were merely stereotyped factoids learned in grade school.  It also made me realize that Lincoln, as great as he was, was not great in isolation, but in the relationships he had with many other great men who were his friends and enemies.<br /><br />Read this book, and learn something you didn't know before.  Read this book and experience the anguish and jubilation of a time that shaped our nation.  Lincoln and what he accomplished are still affecting our nation today.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|great movie.  a nice part 2 of the series of tron.  takes you to a futuristic place that maybe we'll all live in one day.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Loved it! Just when I thought Neil Gaiman couldn't get better, he did. The man has a way with words. No one tells a story like Neil Gaiman.
0156711427|1.0|Sorry, but this is a poor novel indeed. Sure the dialogue is adeptly crafted, and at rare times you do get a feel for being in Northern India but this is a ponderously slow, and tediously uneventful book. Why it is rated as one of the great classics of English literature is totally mind-blowing. It is not only not one of the greatest books of all time , it is not even among the thousands of the very good, or even the good books of our language. Do not waste your time on this falsely touted exercise in futility.

0307352153|5.0|I no longer apologize for who and how I am.  I've have talked about this book so often and recommend it constantly. Introverts and Extroverts alike should read this - especially extroverts in relationships with introverts.
0385528787|5.0|First, let me say that if you haven't read [[ASIN:0385721676 Oryx and Crake]] and [[ASIN:0307455475 The Year of the Flood]], you should start there. Both are excellent books, and there's no reason to try to skip straight to this one. You can read those two in either order, but this one really should come last. [[ASIN:0385721676 Oryx and Crake]] was published first, but, if you're turned off by the idea of a really bleak dystopian fiction, consider starting with [[ASIN:0307455475 The Year of the Flood]] to ease yourself in.<br /><br />I'm not sure anyone who has read the first two books needs much more motivation to read MadAddam, but I'll say a bit more just in case. MadAddam picks up right where Year of the Flood left off (minutes after where Oryx and Crake left off) and follows the story of the survivors as they begin to rebuild. However, like the first two books, much of the story take place in the past. Atwood devotes the majority of the novel's pages to the back story of one of the survivors we met in Year of the Flood. Having heard that this book tells the story of what happens after the first two books, I must admit that I was a bit disappointed to have Atwood spend so much time in the past. But, as I read, I realized that the way she ties the story of the past into the story of the future is what makes this novel so brilliant. As much as I'd love to elaborate, I think it's better to let readers experience that development at their pace. Just know, if you're wondering why she's spending so much time in the past, that she has a plan.<br /><br />This third book is definitely more similar in tone to Year of the Flood than it is to Oryx and Crake. Although some of it is dark, it's suffused with humor. And, the story of a group of survivors attempting to rebuild is hopeful.<br /><br />I should warn that the role of the pigoons in this one was a bit too much for me and almost caused me to round down to four stars. I don't want to say more about it than that. It's just that, as much as I loved everything else in this book (and the two before it), I couldn't help rolling my eyes at the pigoons in this one.ust that, as much as I loved everything else in this book (and the two before it), I couldn't help rolling my eyes at the pigoons in this one.

B00DGRCA4I|5.0|These past few years I have been on a journey to catch-up on as many of the releases from the \\"family\\", Experience Hendrix.  Their releases are consistent in the quality of the sound, stunning at times for the era, along with write-ups seldom seen in any CD's today.  For that I am grateful and don't care what is or isn't included.  Why?  Very simple.  I want to listen to the music in all of its glory!  Jimi was a \\"consummate\\" (completion/perfection) player with a spirit second to none.  Can't imagine the Concert prices compared to today!  As for this release, it captures the 2000 issue and adds 4 songs already noted elsewhere in the reviews along with the excellent 80 page booklet.  Yes, there maybe a few of these songs in later issues but for this release, the music is still powerful.  Let us celebrate what we can \\"hear\\" and enjoy.  Once us \\"baby boomers\\" have moved on, am not sure who will be the buying audience for CD's.  Until then, I see more Hendrix music is on it's way later this year.  I wonder if Eddie Kramer ever imagined his continuing involvement with Jimi's music so far down the road when it was first recorded?  It still gives me goosebumps when I hear \\"his\\" music and his truly talented band mates.  Rock on!

B004ZN9RWK|5.0|When I was ten years old my sister gave me a copy of The Dark Side Of The Moon for our return trip returning home from Jamaica.It was late at night and all the lights on the plane were dimmed way down. It was nice. The plane was almost empty except for my family and I (it was not a small plane) and we each got our own secluded section of the plane. As the airplane ride continued I took out my CD player, my headphones, and my CDs and popped Dark Side Of The Moon into my CD player. As the music began to play I was gazing out of the window at the vastness and beauty of the Caribbean sea. The song Breath began to play and I noticed mini storms forming far below flashing lightning strikes that were so miniscule against the vast sea. I was in awe. Time begins to play as we enter a cloud and I become mindful of the fact that we're soaring high across the sky at incredible speeds. The breathtaking beauty of the music I was hearing evoked a sense of aliveness not often experienced. I was so happy with the CD that I held on to it and have been a huge fan of Pink Floyd ever since.

B0074QGGK6|4.0|A short book with lots of wisdom.  Its summary method will appeal to younger people.  Note to Amazon: if you want people to do these reviews take what they write and work with it; don't mandate the number of words they have to write like some sort of control freaks!
B005EHQGTS|4.0|Pretty fast, reasonably smooth, and pretty nice interface design.  Two major problems in my opinion.<br /><br />First, you have to go through their server to get to your PC(s).  This means you buy their software and then you have to get a subscription in order to connect to your system when you are off your home network (i.e. at a hotspot at a coffee shop or at the wifi at the mall).  Even when you ARE on your home network you have to go through their servers unless you specifically set an IP to connect to.  They need to add an autodiscovery option that will a) detect that you are on your home network if you have specified your home network in the app settings, b) run a scan of the network to discover splashtop streaming servers running on it, and c) give you a screen that allows the app to directly connect to one of those servers rather than going out to a server and then coming back in in order for you to connect.<br /><br />Second, you still have to leave your game &#34;windowed&#34; in order to play it.  Unlike &#34;Kainy&#34; you have to preconfigure the games you want to play so that they are set to launch in &#34;windowed&#34; mode.  If the game launches in full screen mode you will get dumped out of the game.

B00E0MCYPS|3.0|Three stars for the graphics.  They're similar to Nintendo 64 level, though some of the textures are higher quality.  Play wise, it's just OK.  As others have said, you have one track and two cars to start with, so it can get repetitive.  Apparently, you have to pass a bunch of challenges to open up new tracks and cars.  No in app purchases, though, which is a plus.  The car can be difficult to control with the tilt steering and auto gas enabled (defaults.)  For the tilt steering, I found it was better if I turned off the auto gas and used the on screen buttons, because you can't go full throttle into some of those curves and make it with the tilt steering (at least, I can't.)  Though, I got my best times when I turned off the tilt steering and used the on screen steering buttons.  That turns the auto gas back on (no choice) but I found I was able to control the car better going into some of the tighter curves with the buttons.  It's hard to say how long this will stay installed, it depends on if I forget about it or get bored with that one track.  I wish we could start out with a few tracks unlocked, like a lot of console racing games do.
B003U4UPTE|5.0|The season had lots of surprises! The plot became more intense and allowed you to think about the cast in new ways. Well done!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like figuring stuff out so this game was perfect for me. Too bad it was only until level 10. If it wasn't for that 5 stars for sure.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|The movie is an impressive work of science fiction. The twists in the story come together in the end, weaving an epic work of thrills and twists.<br /><br />As an avid Science Fiction seeker, I can highly recommend this movie, if you enjoy stories with action, suspense, and a unique plot. Then you will enjoy Tom Cruise in Oblivion.<br /><br />Recommended for any Science Fiction, Thriller, and Action Fans.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Amazing book! Such an eye opener, good stuff based on great research. Just like personal finance, I also believe this should be taught in schools!<br /><br />Read it!

B00A285OOW|5.0|Philippa Gregory has captured a woman's perspective of a turbulent period in English history. Usually told from men's accounts of battles, strategies and missions, the War of the Roses, or the Counsins' War becomes more personal when viewed from the vantage of a young woman who was considered the spoils of war despite her royal ranking.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Warm Bodies did an excellent job of taking the classic zombie apocalypse and altering it in a unique, comedic way. The romance is the foundation of the story, but the comedy is what you will stay for.<br /><br />Even if you are not interested in the romantic half of the story, the comedy and zombie additions are worth watching.<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys Comedy, Actions, Zombies, Horror, and Romance.

B00EL8JCGU|5.0|Like I said, I usually don't like this type of action/adventure movie but this movie was about more than just bravado. It reminds me of what families are supposed to be to eachother. ANd how brave you can be when you've got nothing to lose and everything to live for. I also liked the fact that Israel was right on top of technology first because Israel is first in so much technology that is new and vital for the planet.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|For anyone who has seen The Wonderful Wizard of OZ, they will have a general idea of what this movie is like. Just add modern enhancements along with a touch of Disney and you have a fairly impressive prequel to a classic.<br /><br />The acting is enjoyable, the story is unique, and most of all, it is a fun clean movie to watch. I would recommend the movie to anyone looking for a family video.

So far I've only used it with my HP printer (I'm really hoping it works this well with my Canon!).<br />It's very easy to print from mobile and regular sites which seems hard for other apps.

B000W91RUG|5.0|i love watching big bang and for the price yeah im buy more im going to get all the seasons of this show. i have not seen one episode that i did not lol watch it...
B000FBJHT4|5.0|I can't believe that this book has been around over a decade without my having read it.  It kept me up past 2:00AM every night until I finished it.  Even though I lived through much of the Cold War, my knowledge of it increased exponentially through this book.  The hard information about &#34;the Crash&#34; could have fit into a few pages, but the story of how it has reverberated through and affected history for over 60 years took many more fascinating pages.  An engineer friend of mine recommended the book and I cannot wait to have a long debriefing with him about it.
0142001104|5.0|fun book to read. Creative way to convey the ART of possbilility for all to understand and have hope for inspiring others and personally working at the possibilities!
1594484805|5.0|The greatest book over motivation I have ever read! Love the ideas and the way the author presents his book.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Acting superb.  I was enthralled  by every scene, some made me happy, and some made me so sad I cried.  Loved every minute of Season 3.
B00F35BV64|4.0|I appreciated the philosophical issues raised, the inside jokes that referenced the earlier series and a good mix of action, camp and philosophy.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love how there is so much variety in this game. The fish and plants are so beautiful.i wish more of my friends played.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Very happy with this app...it does so many things. One of the best apps I have downloaded. You won't regret it.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Sort of a great sci-fi movie with a tiny bit of a love story in it. So the guys will like all the action and sci-fi stuff and the ladies will like the love story parts.<br /><br />I am just not much of a Tom Cruise fan though. I find that the characters he plays could pretty much be played by any leading man type of actor. But when he is the actor I find it hard to take him seriously and he never really becomes the character for me.<br /><br />Instead I tend to think of him saying to himself in his head &#34;Well that dangerous stunt that I just did myself was really manly of me!&#34; and &#34;People will really think of me as a manly man now!&#34; And then I will usually notice the actors that are taller than him.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman, Gerard Butler, Daniel Craig, Guy Pearce, Chris Hemsworth, Channing Tatum, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, Vin Diesel, Matthew McConaughey, Mark Wahlberg any of these guys or whoever your favorite male actor is could've played Tom's character.<br /><br />So when you watch it, picture your favorite or one of these guys in his place & you'll like the movie even better!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was beautifully written. My niece read it and insisted I read it...I'm glad I did. It made me laugh and made me cry. It was perfect :)
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Better than Stallone's for shure! Helmet stays on for old Joe! Too bad it didn't made enough money for a sequel, would love to see cursed earth storyline.
B002A9VJ40|5.0|A top movie from the 80's with classic movie lines like &#34;I feel the need .... the need for speed&#34;!
B002LU0E26|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie. It is a longer running time, so be prepared. Once the action starts it doesn't give up!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The writing is exciting and unpredictable.  I had strong feelings for each character.  My only regret was that I ran out of episodes to watch.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|I love stories based off of fairy tales (GRIMM,Once Upon a TIme)  and this gives a taste of a few our childhood favorites  with a twist. This movie was entertaining from beginning to end. I will definitely watch this again.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|We started watching season 3 last Sunday. Before we knew it, we watched 9 episodes back to back. One of the best shows currently on tv. It's sooooo addictive!
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|Just saw Tony Bennett in concert, loved him so much I came right home and bought this DVD!  Great DVD, what an eclectic group of duets!
B000053VAZ|5.0|I had forgotten how good this movie is.  I was not disappointed and Johnny Depp is the greatest.  It's a feel good story
B008JFUP0I|5.0|I am not going to write a long review.I will just say that in my opinion,it is the best one yet.My favorite was the second one.First was good also but I liked the second one better.Tokyo Drift was horrible.4 was good and 5 was okay but not a lot of racing and not that good of a story line.<br /><br />What kills me is the people that bash this movie keep crying how fake and unreal it is.Hello,it is a movie.I mean,did you watch the first one and actually watch the first one and thought that the scene that Van Disel did when he raced Brian to the railroad tracks and got hit by the train and his car flipped 1000 times and Van Disel walks away from it happens everyday?<br /><br />I personally think the should have kept Lydia dead.I hate when they kill a character and bring them back 2 movies later.Kinda makes it look like they are desperate to keep the fan base.But overall,I think it was a great movie and the best one so far.And from the end of the movie gives indication,it is only going to get better(make sure you do not turn off the movie at the end if you have not seen it)
1419705644|4.0|Those that are looking to learn a little bit more about the land of Ooo should definitely give this book a look. It's decently long, has tons of great artwork, and fun facts about the characters, creatures, and places in Adventure Time. Definitely worth the money for those who love the show. If you're a die hard fan, there's probably not anything you don't already know from the show. It's still fun to read though :)<br /><br />The only part I was a bit disappointed in was the perspective of the author (Abadeer, Marzeline's dad). This leads to a very negative view on all the characters, which for awhile is fun, but in the end just becomes tedious and unfunny.<br /><br />On the plus side, Abadeer has an extensive vocabulary. You're ought to learn a new words, like myself. :)
B004JZBGWI|5.0|this is a very good app,i am so organized now that i have it.i love it  has everything you could think of.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Visually great! Movie was entertaining and fun. Interesting concept and story line. Some story line holes, but overall a recommendation.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|It's where no Man has gone before!!!! Great to see the original cast and crew. Brings back New technology of the old days. Before we even landed on the moon. Before political correctness. Love it!!!<br /><br />rdschwizeryahoo

B00F57VFXO|5.0|It's five years after the first `Ian Fleming Files' adventure (`The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada') and 17F has been called into action in the final stages of the war. Hitler is destroying himself and Germany faces imminent defeat. Only a secret society of anti-Hitlerian Nazis named Parsifal have other plans. They want to assassinate the Fuhrer and replace him with Rommel. Britain's Naval Intelligence dispatches Ian Fleming to Cairo to meet with Peter Ugarte, Parsifal's treasurer who has defected and absconded with the head of Parsifal's fiancee... It's a terrific set-up and the rest of the plot is a whirlwind ride. I think this book marks an improvement on `Operation Armada.' The action has been toned down to be more credible and the characterizations have more depth. Ian Fleming feels fully dimensional and there's a lot more going on than just fights with Nazis and bedding beauties (tho there's plenty of that too!).  `The Ian Fleming Files' is shaping up to be a meaty series, one readers can really sink their teeth into.  I was very impressed with the overall writing. A solid entertainment up there with the best spy and World War 2 fiction. Recommended to fans of Daniel Silva, Laura Hillenbrand and of course Ian Fleming!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is fun and entertaining<br />i would recommend this app the animation is really good and nothing is blurry . it / is a great game

B00BEIYOHC|2.0|\\"Insidious\\" went on to become one (really wanted to say \\"Wan\\" instead of \\"one\\" here) of the most profitable films of 2011 and one of the most talked about horror films of the past few years despite having such a small budget. Most people seemed to really enjoy it, but its extremely loud music and repetitive use of cheap and jump out scares became tiresome overall. Now, two years later, \\"Insidious: Chapter 2\\" has been released and director James Wan swears it's his swan song to the horror genre. If that's the case, then Wan really should have stepped out of the game with \\"The Conjuring.\\"<br /><br />Like its predecessor, the most intriguing segments of \\"Insidious: Chapter 2\\" take place in The Further. The music isn't nearly as obnoxious this time around. In fact, other than the music used with the title card and closing credits, the score of the film is much more subdued otherwise. The moments of complete silence are still there, but the music is much more restrained, softer, and less \\"in your face,\\" which is a very gratifying alteration.<br /><br />The scenes that take place in The Further are the creepiest aside from the closet sequence with Dalton and a tin can telephone. The manner in which \\"Insidious: Chapter 2\\" connects to the first film is more complicated and interesting than you're initially lead to believe. Patrick Wilson's performance seems a little rough at first, but evolves into this enigma that's much more spellbinding. He's extremely off-putting at times and yet you're mesmerized by the duress that Josh is being put through.<br /><br />The original was a little slow at times, but the sequel feels like it takes an even longer amount of time to get things rolling. Events like the piano playing itself, baby toys going off on their own, strange women walking the halls, and a baby monitor being used like a lifeline are all that awaits you in the first half of the film. The importance of the sound of a metronome or hearing a clock tick in the background is intriguing, but isn't enough to really immerse the audience in a return to this world.<br /><br />Poor Rose Byrne seems to have returned just to get the crap beaten out of her for the sequel. She gets the hell slapped out of her by a poltergeist, has a teapot thrown at her back at full force by a grown man, and gets thrown across the room. \\"Insidious: Chapter 2\\" is much more comedic in comparison to the original. Specs (Leigh Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) are nothing but pure comedic relief with their hunter-ninja-bear game, the quesadilla/unicorn code word argument, and the entire tranquilizer sequence. The ending is predictable sequel bait that seems thrown in just to keep the franchise going after Wan's exit. Don't expect any answers after the credits either because there's nothing there.<br /><br />\\"Insidious: Chapter 2\\" has a slower pace and a lighter, goofier tone than the original film. The jump-out scares have been tucked away and are more methodical in execution. However the sequel will likely not be as much of a crowd-pleaser as \\"Insidious.\\" There's no doubt \\"Insidious: Chapter 2\\" will be profitable. It'll likely take first place opening weekend and be successful based on the positive reputation of the first film alone, but the sequel will more than likely be seen as a disappointment that doesn't live up to its predecessor.ntriguing, but isn't enough to really immerse the audience in a return to this world.<br /><br />Poor Rose Byrne seems to have returned just to get the crap beaten out of her for the sequel.

B009EEFTMC|5.0|you are  playing against your self or others I just like playing trying to beat my own time. I love this game with the eye and hand working together it make your mind go into a new phase of how to focus. It make you think more and more. I would recommend it to everyone.
B004GJNFHG|5.0|It was almost as if watching a documentary about this real situation. Quite powerful, just extremely sad. What the actors had to do was phenomenal.
1848507836|5.0|This story makes you think about the relativity of right and wrong and that goodness is in everyone even if their choices are considered bad by society.  We must find peace with in ourselves and not fall to societal pressures.  Loved the perspective and honesty of the author.

B008NXMXME|5.0|They review the \\"standard model\\" of economic development (see below), show it is not sufficient to explain different results in very similar countries. Rather, comparison of histories of many different countries leads them to conclude that industrial growth is facilitated when inclusive institutions dominate, so that most people feel that they have the opportunity to advance and that it is to their advantage to do so, and when (as a consequence) wages are relatively high, so that it is economical to invest in labor-saving improvements.  Such growth is marked by creative destruction, in which jobs are replaced when improvements are implemented.<br /><br />On the contrary, progress is limited when the society is dominated by top-down, extractive institutions.  This includes societies built on slavery or otherwise invested in keeping people poor so that labor will be cheap.  It includes situations where graft and corruption siphon away any incentive to improve.  It includes government by dictators and elite groups who do not allow creative destruction to occur.  Therefore, extractive societies can show economic growth, but will not allow innovations which might cause creative destruction.  In all cases, growth requires a central government strong enough to provide rule of law, stability and security of people and property.<br /><br />Analysis includes excellent detailed socio/economic histories of the Roman Empire, the Mayan city-states, medieval Venice, England, Japan, the Soviet Union, Latin America, and Africa, e.g. comparing the success of Botswana to other African states.<br /><br />Standard Model for economic growth:<br />Education of masses<br />Improve transportation within country, remove internal tariffs.<br />Provide banking system or otherwise provide capital for people to use for startups.<br />Erect external tariffs until local industries can compete with imports.<br /><br />China:  Their analysis suggests that this country will not be able to sustain economic growth at the current rate of 10%.  They argue that the Chinese Communist Party is an extractive system which can (as it did in the Soviet Union) make large leaps forward by central planning and adopting improvements invented elsewhere, but that progress is likely to be halted when the interests of the ruling elites are threatened (as it did in Russia).  A recent example involves a steel mill owner, Dai Guofang, who had hoped to undercut the prices of the state-run mills (p. 437).  He was arrested on trumped up charges and spent five years in jail, apparently because the Central Committee in Bejing did not approve his plan (the local Communist Party had).nomic growth at the current rate of 10%.

The longitudinal studies of high reactive versus low reactive babies and how they follow predictable though unexpected patterns of personality development was compelling.

B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|In the beginning, Dylan was a folk musician and some fifty years later not a whole lot has changed. Sure he had his Rock and Roll and Pop periods which gave us a bunch of great music but in retrospect  this seems like a detour between  \\"Bob Dylan\\" in 1962 and the re-emergence  of the \\"folky\\"  Dylan in \\"Good as I been to You\\" from 1992 which has continued through \\"Tempest\\".\\" Another Basement Tape\\"  is an important addition to that Legacy which helps bring his entire year in focus.  Several of the songs are classics including \\"Copper Kettle\\", \\"Master Piece\\",\\" Pretty Saro\\"  and \\"Went to See the Gypsy\\".<br />His voice are as pure as it ever was and it is a perfect match to Bromberg's Guitar and Kooper's  piano.<br />This album gets my highest recommendation.
B0041WVTBM|5.0|Loved it then.  Love it now.  By now we all know all the backstory, and we know what happened with the actors if not the characters.  We certainly know how our own lives have evolved.  So the pleasure that was there from the beginning is now enhanced even more because we know it isn't just a story of our generation, but a story of every generation.  And set to awesome music and beautifully laid out for us.  Thanks Lawrence Kasden.
B008PU8SR4|4.0|A thoughtful and interesting approach to the challenges faced by many families in the format of a who dunnit. I enjoyed it and at the same time it did make me think.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|Science fiction can be fun. This movie tried too hard to be believable. As cruel and inhumane as some governments are, this woiuld have been more believable if the chosen group were herded together and blown up with a bomb. Watched the movie thinking I must be as insane as the ruling society on the screen to waste the time to watch it.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Awesome!  Love everything about the Hulk not too mention the black widow who is smokin' hot!  This is a must see...
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I read this book for book club, and I loved it. I read it in one night in about four hours,and  I will admit I cried about three times. Very touching and sad at the same time. Would recommend to anyone wanting a good read. I can't wait to read Where she went.
B007PJFIU6|5.0|Dixit is a great board game for learning languages. The only complaint I have is that some of the images are a little sadistic.

Now, the app has stopped working on my Samsung Galaxy Tab - never fully launches and ends up locking up the tablet. I don't know if this is Amazon's way of passively not supporting tablets other than their own, but as a long time Amazon customer, it is really aggravating that I can't access my content.

B000GPIPD8|4.0|When I first put this on I thought, &#34;Man this raw!&#34;. And it is. It is stripped down, vintage sounding, minimal production, 4-5 chord rock/blues.<br /><br />It's also great. I mean it is classic stuff. These guys are really good at what they do and makes me wish I could do the same thing with my guitar. That however would require the impeccable timing, rock riffing and song writing that Auerbach has perfected and I don't have that.<br /><br />I like to listen to this especially when I work out.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I love the characters and the premises of the show.  Did not want it to end.  I am sorry it was canceled.
B007V5CF5K|3.0|First of all the game stopped working so often that is was really enerving(I played on a kindle fire hd witch usually work well with this sort of games).I couldn't finish the game because the pan I needed disappeared under the tool bar and I couln't accesss it again even restarting the game. Luckily the game was nearly ending.The search of the hidden objects parts becomes boring after a while.The story is really stupid and doesn't bring any interess to the game.The puzzle are easy but sometimes not logical.If the game doesn't have glitches on your device it is just good for kids or beginners.

B007I2BZIE|2.0|I'm a lifetime Rush fan and have stuck with them since the beginning.  At first listen of this album I did the face in palm as I have done with other Rush albums. However, after listening to this more and more I now realize the songs are very good. HOWEVER, the mixing is terrible and its extremely distorted.  Sad since its great music. Too irritating to listen to.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I enjoyed this book but it could have been longer. Thank you for the free read and I will look for more books by this author.
1451620837|4.0|This book is a must-read for KISS fans; the warts-and-all approach taken by Criss makes for some pretty delicious reading. That said, it is clear that Criss (and the book) would have benefited greatly from a 12 step program before telling this story.<br />If you have ever lived with an addict, you will immediately recognize the thought and behavior patterns. The events described, as well as the conclusions arrived at by Criss regarding the outcomes, are all told through the lens of the unrecovered addict. Attributions, blame, recriminations, regrets.... all are on full display in these pages.<br />This is the story of a guy who was in the right place at the right time more than once, and continued to make the same mistakes over and over again. He indulged every appetite that he had, and pursued sex and drugs with such enthusiasm that he never took enough interest to look at the things that mattered. It makes for a salacious read, but one can't help but become frustrated with the author's inability to take responsibility for his own failures- especially when he is so quick to point out how hard he worked for his successes.<br />While I can heartily recommend this book to any KISS fan, I would also recommend that Peter take a meeting or two, paying special attention to the fourth step. It's never too late bro.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I ordered this 3D Star Trek Monday morning with regular shipping. I received it Thursday 2 days after its release. I was able to see it last night with my wife. We are both huge fans of the original series. However, we were split with our reviews. For me it was so cool to be on the Enterprise in 3D. So I was hooked right away. I won't go thru the story line as most others comment on this. I will just say sometimes history repeats itself and this movie takes full advantage of this new adventure with Kirk & Spock. I really expect the next release to continue with the Captain and Dr. Marcus. After all, we did have a really big surprise when we first meet their son.(remember) So I give it the best rating mostly based on the 3D effects and the run in with our \\"old friend\\" Kahn.<br />  My wife however felt different with the movies ending. She felt they just ripped off Trek fans with an old idea with a twist. But, I will run this at least 1 more time and like a true fan she will watch it again. My thought is she will come around because this was visually stunning and the soundtrack is so perfect on the 3D Blu-ray, 7.1 makes it stand out like no other movie in this series.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very fun. some minigames are challenging but you can replay games you have completed and earn extra points.
B008YZ4RR0|1.0|This is a GREAT movie that Amazon ruined. Amazon just can't get streaming video to work. It it constantly loosing connection and then times out. I have even gone to the extent of verifying my Broadband Speed to make sure that the connection issue is not with me. What I think is happening is that Amazon is doing everything in their power to limit bandwidth and if that means that your movie gets interrupted numerous times then so be it. Amazon cares not about your viewing pleasure. Buyers beware.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I have not seen the HBO series so i was taken with all the twists and turns and really enjoyed the character development.  I highly recommend it for pleasure reading. It is very difficult to put it down and to guess what comes next.  I love the book!

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome but I just want a little thing... Let the minions do there own actions when they're running
B0080TBS40|4.0|It's not fair to compare this to The Black Crowes, but I can't seem to muster anything more articulate than this.  The CRB sound like the Crowes on some of the best weed money can buy.  The band is tight, but loose and relaxed.  The musicianship is top notch and<br />it will help you shake off the stress of a crappy day and put a smile on your face.  Lots of soul, good vibes and great tunes.
0345803485|1.0|Quick shipment. Satisfied with purchase overall, but couldn't get through it without laughing. Its not a comedy.  Would not purchase this item again.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I wouldn't say the book is brilliant but the story was good enough to keep you reading.  The story was paced well.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|Just got started friend showed it to me. the controls are hard to get used to with the touch screen but overall good graphics.
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|I always decide whether I like a movie or not by its ending...this one was worth waiting for. Great acting and decent effects, this film really has you &#34;feeling&#34; for the actors not allowed to feel. Well done!

B00CTXBO9M|4.0|Very cute and easy to use for my 6 yr old.  He loves playing it.  Easy controls and self explanatory.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I have become a regular viewer of the tv show. I decided to<br />read one of the books that spawned it. It is well worth the<br />effort. The characters are well crafted, the plot is tightly<br />written. It is a great read.
B004FHP9KA|5.0|I hadn't given this much thought to the possibilities with dreaming until I saw this film.  Very imaginitive, different, and enjoyable.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book to read decided to read the book after watching the movie can't wait for the second movie because I just started on book two! Very suspenseful and could happen one day that's the scariest part!;)<br /><br />Would recommend to all it's all together a very well written book!
B005UA0FLE|5.0|I was looking to add some new Christmas music to my collection and I came across this, I listened to it and loved it. I love his voice.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I loved this book so much. I have never laughed and cried so much through a book before. I truly enjoyed every word. I especially loved how poetry was a big part of this story with it's unique storyline. I didn't expect a lot of things that happened to happen and it kept me guessing. This may be my favorite book so far!
1400049628|5.0|lots of fun reading this. It's written in a very systematic and readable fashion. All the areas you could think of are covered, from vehicle selection, weapons and even physical location.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|I chose the Apple connector over 3rd party brands because I wanted to give myself the &#34;best&#34; possibility of it working with my iPad. I can transfer pictures from my camera to my iPad via the USB connector. Unfortunately, the card reader doesn't work for me because it can't read the XC flavor of the SD cards. It does, however, work for the slower cards.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book!!  Such a great writing style. I will definitely be looking for more books by this author.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I like the show very much it keeps you on the edge of your seat and makes you  want more
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|I don't feel like typing on my phone right now, but like this album enough to struggle through this so that I may add a 5 star review. Can't add much more than what's been said by others already. All the songs are great, minus \\"everything\\". But I can see why Trenton did it (everything) . He does have pop roots after all.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|A wonderful story that kids and adults enjoy.  It provides a unique twist in the vampire genre.  A movie to watch more than once.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|Great message delivered in an entertaining way. Choose yourself today , do your daily practice, and deliver value to others. Advice to live by. Thanks James.

B005F9CP7M|5.0|A great continuation in Sporty Spice's solo career.  The songwriting is delicious to the soul and her voice is food for the ears!!!  Each song is a stand out.  This girl can't stop producing such amazing songs, and we definitely don't want her to!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is awesome and a tragic love story and I can't wait to read the second and third books

B00BY8DIT2|5.0|if you loved, or even liked their first outting on &#34;Don't Explain&#34;, you are gonna be over the moon for the new &#34;SEESAW&#34;.  Beth Hart's vocals soar and cut so deeply on each and every track, that she sits on the high pedistals that the original singers have taken residence upon.  Beth knocked me over with her rendition of Nutbush City Limits, and gives Tina Turner a run for her money!!!  A must have for any fan of the blues!!!
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|It was really bad, left a bad tast in my mouth. I wish I didn't waist my time watching it.
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|Let me start by saying, I purchased this gaming mouse out of necessity. The game I currently play the most  (Mechwarrior Online) is a game that has many functions, my original mouse, while decently fast in terms of DPI and other things, did not have any more buttons than three, so to me, this gaming mouse was the cheapest upgrade I could get that would satisfy the game's requirements for higher level play. The mouse did deliver, the addition of the extra three buttons near the thumb allowed me to play without worrying about any lack of easily accessible buttons anymore.<br />With that said, there were a couple growing pains with the mouse.<br /><br />Anker certainly made a decent effort in trying to make an optimal gaming mouse, good work for their first attempt, but there are a couple small but prevalent annoyances with this mouse. The first one, I am not sure can be helped, the mouse is a bit hard to adjust to if you are upgrading from a normal mouse, the Anker mouse is definitely bigger than a normal mouse, so if it is your first gaming mouse, it will take some time getting used to having a considerably bigger mouse to cup with your palm. The second complaint is probably a lot less serious for some, but there is not way to truly disable the lighting inside the mouse, which I understand I may be a minority here, but I really would rather not have the lighting illumining the middle part and the mouse wheel.<br /><br />The third complaint is the most serious, the instruction manual says nothing about the macro making part of this mouse, considering this was my first gaming mouse, I expected some sort of tutorial on how to make macros, and some premade macros to have an example to go by. (I.E turbo left click) the macro screen is also not accessible by the main interface which is also annoying. I am moderately tech savy but I could not for the life of me figure out how to make any sort of macro that would just sort of repeatedly press or hold down left click for me.I eventually turned to autohotkey instead and downloaded a premade macro. The anker gaming mouse is in dire need of premade macros and a tutorial either in the interface or the instruction book for us gamers that are unfamiliar with macros, rather than having the user go trough trail and error through a clunky macro interface to get a macro they are happy with.<br /><br />Now aside from these complaints, the mouse is as I said, very good for the price, more buttons, fast polling rate, up to 8000 dpI, the weight tuning kit, it all makes for a great mouse, the good qualities of this mouse far outweigh the bad. Though, it of course could use some improvement. If you need a cheap upgrade from a normal mouse, this is probably your best bet.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|This is the album that got me into AFI when I was a preteen. I never had my own copy, so it's been a long while since I've heard many of the songs. This album is absolutely beautiful and completely recommended.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Cast and writing are fabulous.  Waiting very patiently for the next season to show up.  Can't wait to see who they bring in as new cast members...  :)
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is rather fun. Simple controls and great graphics. Basically gotta spend real money to buy costumes u want. Search the net for cheat codes. Those codes will help out. Do codes b4 u play to much of game.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I decided to read the Walt Longmire mysteries after having caught 2 later episodes of the television series and started here, at the beginning.  I instantly felt myself so &#34;at home&#34; with the characters and the broad brush strokes of Craig Johnson's writing, I have plowed right through the entire series.  The Walt Longmire, Henry Standing Bear and Victoria Moretti of the books are so much more entertaining than the tv series, but the characters are well-cast for the show, just a bit different than the books.  Story threads from the books are incorporated into the tv series, which actually makes reading the books a must if you like the show.  The books are so interesting in their depictions of the indigenous peoples and Walt's relationship to them and acceptance by them, it's hard to stop reading at night and go to sleep!  This review is about The Cold Dish, but I feel the apex of the series is Hell is Empty.  I am an avid reader (compulsive, actually) and get quickly vested in good series.  There have been a few I have read more than 1 time, and this will be another one.  I know where I would take the characters in future story lines, but this is the author's work of art, so I will defer to him and wait to see what develops.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Who doesn't love Angry Birds!! I know I love it. Just one of the many awesome apps available from Angry Birds.
0452284392|5.0|Perhaps the best writing I have come across with multi dimensional perspectives around a simple yet highly effective logic. You need a bit of mathematical taste to parse and digest what barabasi is saying, but not at all far from what a layman can manage to understand
B003NX76BM|5.0|I have always loved Nora Roberts' books but this one stands above the rest. I have already read it several times! I love how the characters interact with each other...It's more of a real relationship than most romance books nowadays. They fight, they have flaws, they recognize each others flaws and love them anyway. I would recommend this book to any and everyone!!!!!!!
B009CG9LZI|4.0|Entertaining. Sweet. Funny. I remember enjoying this movie when it came out. Recently, our almost 4 year old son has been loving Dr. Seuss and the Grinch especially. He was afraid of this movie at first, but now requests it.
0307155102|5.0|Very easy way to build a child's library.  I intend to buy more of Richard Scarry's books... They are real classics.

B0053EZY04|1.0|Bad everything.<br />Bad acting<br />Bad storyline<br />Awful special effects<br />Looked like an old B movie on cable.<br />Only good part of the movie was the cars he drove.
B0065NAKRO|2.0|Tiles are VERY small and movement of tiles is odd - you slide it up from your stock but then it moves down from the top.<br /><br />Available tiles are lighted taking all chance of missing a play and drawing another tile by mistake - it almost plays itself.<br /><br />Would have returned for a refund if I could.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and challenging. Would have paid for it. The reviewers were all right about this app. Can't wait for more.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I must admit that this Chromecast is easy to install with its fool proof system, even in IOS with its limited wifi setup options. The lack of apps available for this device makes it a an expensive Netflix and Youtube viewer hence, i recommend you to hold on to your 35 bucs till more apps are available and (for IOS users) the setup is more explicit.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|One of the best series I've ever watched.  I love British tv and this has kept my undivided attention since the first episode.  I can't wait to see how it plays out.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Love google because it is easy, quick, free and available. It takes me where I want to go and even guides me when I am not sure where I want to go.
B009NQZVKG|2.0|Pale in comparison to his other books. Had too much going on in terms of storylines and plot got diluted trying to make everything fit into one book.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I like the gradual gentle alarm you can choose. IT is a very good app and I would recommend it.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I HATE THIS BOOK SO MUCH IT IS SO BORING I ALMOST WELL I ATUALLY DID FALL ASLLEP WHILE READING THIS BOOK

B00B0X4PIO|3.0|This book is not as good as his previous books. The constant changes of time and place were not easy to follow. I had expected more and was disappointed.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love my weather app. Its nice to have the weather at my fingertips and its almost always accurate and on time
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Forget the horror: this book is a perfect picture of a possible socio-economical near future. I hope a new book of the same story is already in preparation...
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The Good Wife is an excellent show with great acting, good story line and enough mystery to keep you guessing. So far, the outcomes have all been happy endings.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I truly like this feature, however, I was hoping that the App would not work while the Kindle is shut off.
B002APU580|5.0|I have the Greer Garson version and thought excellent but this version brings a touch of Jane Eyre drama and feel but the humor and love of two so engrossing people..  The drama that plays out between the two, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, is like a dream all women might wish for themselves.  The stories within the story are beautifully produced and performed.  It really makes one feel good and wanting more.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love the challenges in each level...the only thing is once you reach a certain level you can't move on until you rate it, which is why I am doing so now.. still pretty fun game.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Was a really good movie. Good story good acting. Enjoyed the movie. So tired of reboots. This was over all a great movie
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful and funny series. A great way to avoid really bad TV advertisements, and the glut of really bad network and reality TV shows on cable.
B001VU1NJ0|5.0|Eerie and thrilling story that will have you on the edge of your seat. Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys a good mystery.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Can't play New levels this irritates me very much I buy the app and I get this ? Maybe it is because u guys r too focused on part 2 instead of what we have its such a bummer....
B008NW67E0|5.0|Now I can understand Mumford & Sons won a Grammy for this album. Really clean, unique vocals. My wife, who had never heard them, went crazy when she listened to cd.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Not since Upstairs Downstairs have I seen a more engaging or well acted historical drama.  The history is right, the costumes are right and the actors take a good script and make it great.  Over all of this looms the silent character of the house, that like some demanding and petulant elder, demands so much of the Crawley family and staff. Simply elegant drama.
0739368435|5.0|I had previously read this book on a recommendation from a friend, and I found it one of the best books I have read a long time.<br /><br />I then pestered my wife to read it, and finally borrowed this audiobook from our library.  We listed to it together, and the audiobook was even better than my first read.<br /><br />A number of different narrators are used for the different characters (the book is presented as a series of personnel letters to and from various characters).  All are spot on and pull you in.<br /><br />The story itself will take you to a place that few people really know and tell a little known but powerful story of the Nazi occupation of the Channel Islands.  Rather than focus on the war, the book focuses on how people find support in one another, and the books and stories they share.<br /><br />Terrific storytelling, wonderfully produced.  Don't pass this one up.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This clock is a good app. I like how you can set timers for different days of the week. Worth a buck
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Everyone loves redemption stories, and this is a brilliant one. James Bowen wrote himself right into my heart, and Bob is a unique character in his own right. I hope they continue on together for many years.
B008JFUNNM|5.0|One word, \\"Phenomenal\\" I could literally stop this review right there!  I was invited to the first screening of the movie in Tampa and after having watched the trailer I knew for sure this was a movie I didn't want to miss.  I accepted the invite and printed my tickets and informed friends of the screening so they could get theirs and then we waited for the day to arrive.  In the meantime I began to research the story of the MV Maersk Alabama and the related hijackings.<br /><br />First let me say this movie is a true story and seemed to match the details of the original story very accurately as it was based on the book \\"A Captain's Duty\\" penned by the man Richard Phillips himself and the screenplay was adapted from his book by Billy Ray.<br /><br />The story begins introducing us to Captain Richard \\"Rich\\" Phillips and humanizes him through a discussion with his wife about their children.  Within a few minutes, we're taken to a small village in Somalia where a band thugs arrives to pressure the locals into going back to the work of hijacking Marine Vessels and returning their cargo to the regional warlords where the ship is then ransomed back to the owners.<br /><br />After a failed attempt to board the Maersk Alabama the pirates rejoin their mother ship and repair their boat and add a second engine to help the skiff catch the larger, more powerful vessel.  The Crew users flairs, high pressure water hoses, a series of 30 degree turns in an attempt to fend off the pirates but, all their efforts fail as the ship is boarded and the skiff is sunk. The crew then goes into a series of rehearsed procedures in which most of them hide in the engine room where they take control of the ship and shut it down.  From there two of them risk their lives going above deck to kill the generators which stops emergency lighting and the other retrieves food and water for the men in hiding.<br /><br />In the meantime the pirate captain forces Captain Phillips to take him on a search for the crew to which, he leads one man into a trap that injures the man's feet.  The Captain is then ordered to go with the injured man back to the bridge and he complies.  Of course the rest of the crew seized the opportunity presented to them and overwhelm the Pirate captain.  This sets up the event that would ultimately be the meat of the movie as Captain Phillips is supposed to be exchanged for the Pirate Captain and the pirates are supposed to take the life boat and head home but, they renege on their deal and take Captain Phillips with them.<br /><br />Within a day of being notified the US Navy intercepts the small vessel and the rest of the story really is something you have to witness.  I'm not going to go into much more than this as we're only about 30 minutes into a 2 hour and 10 minute movie and I really recommend seeing this movie as this is my new favorite movie of the year! Seriously, if this doesn't win best picture then Hollywood is an even bigger scam than I could have ever imagined.<br /><br />Captain Richard Phillips is played by Tom Hanks and in my opinion, this is the best acting Tom Hanks has ever done.  For the most part, there's literally nobody else you'll recognize in this movie and given his performance throughout the movie Hanks is more than up to the task of leading the entire cast straight to what is sure to be one award win after another.  The 4 Somali Hijackers also did an outstanding job and they're literally unknowns without a single role to their acting career beyond this movie; they really did an incredible job in their supporting roles.  Seriously, everybody in this film was spot on in their roles and I cannot say enough good things about the acting.<br /><br />As for the political aspect of this movie, there was no swaying from either side and even the decisions made by Obama (this happened during his first term) were only referenced as orders from the White House.<br /><br />Overall, I cannot say enough good things about this filmand how deep it really went.  It was a pretty intense and emotional ending which only further sealed this movie, in my opinion, as one of the best movies to come along in several years and it easily bests the majority of the films released in the past 2 years.<br /><br />For the record, Somali Pirates have attempted three more hijackings of the Maersk Alabama since this incident and each time they were turned away by armed security forces so, this shipping company clearly learned from their mistakes.<br /><br />And another note, the Captain actually returned to work within 2 years of the event.<br /><br />*If any of you want to know how to get into these movies drop me an email and I'll gladly give you the information you want and you'll be receiving invites within a day or so.
B005544V6A|5.0|Excellent show would recommend to all<br />Once you start you can't stop.<br />Compared to all the shows out there this one is just great
B008K9UZY4|1.0|Never got to try it since I never was able to download it!  Don't buy, you can't get a refund.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I love to read and I especially want to know what my grandchildren are reading, so when my grands tell me they are  reading a certain book I always check it out and we talk about what we've read.  I was greatly surprised with this series I could not put it down until I read the  entire series!
B00CS0XOQW|5.0|Great combination of cool  lounge music guaranteed to put your mind to rest and chill your self to complete rest.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|it is useful app for clean up, it is easy to use . I like it and recommend for others.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Or should I say....my 6yr. old Granddaughter Aylah absolutely LOVEs this game!!! She will play all day if I let her , she has time allotments for my Kindle use. Be sure to set parental controls so that your child does not BUY anything or spending is limited....as this is one of those games that they can BUY extras with real money...or it gets charged to your Amazon account.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Never mind that Vince Gill and Paul Franklin are masters at the top of their game - the first sounds of these great Merle Haggard and Buck Owens classics sent shivers up my spine.  I still play my original vinyls.  The subtle differences on this album are part of a fine tribute.<br /><br />This southeastern Pennsylvania guy who loved the nearby Sunset Park here before it died lived in northern California in the mid 60's.  I was lucky enough to experience Buck Owens & the Buckaroos live at The Dreambowl on the Napa-Vallejo Highway and hear him, Don Rich, Doyle Holly, Willie Cantu, and Tom Brumley, and other artists such as Ernest Tubb at that roadhouse.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|good game but not enough coin to keep playing<br />wish it was easier to play more games. would make the game better and I would have given it a higher star rating.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Most recent update (Forest moon) has caused it to become unplayable. I can open the game and get to each planet/city. But whenever I try to open a level the game just closes.<br /><br />UPDATE....I meant to post this awhile back. There was an update sometime in September that fixed the above mentioned issue. Definitely recommend. Changed to 5 star.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|I use this app all the time it replaces my paper notebooks. It would be nice if they provided all the features in the main app instead of charging for add on features.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Great book, have recommended book to friends and family. Cant wait to see more from this author! Good read indeed!
B00EDF43MY|4.0|My toddler likes the little characters doing things like checking in luggage at the airport and I like how it relates the activities we have to go through in a fun way. The app is a bit advanced for a 3 year old but there's still a lot to enjoy.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|Great movie. Watched it twice. Hope they make a sequal.  The movie plot was thought provoking  They can make more World War Z movies with or without Brad Pitt
B005544TRQ|5.0|highly entertaining and it gets better every season after this one.  the pilot isn't the strongest but character development improves and the story gets intense.
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|This is a quick easy read.  Raw memoir of Vietnam from a copter pilot.  Detailed description of an insane job.  Some holds barred, but not many, nothing material held back it seemed.  Overall impression, Mason should marry his wife again.  She's a hero in this one too...
B000HL2J0G|1.0|We tried to view three different episodes, and Amazon Prime kept buffering. Did not get to watch any of the videos.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I do like a good Law show, but rarely....its usually what I don't watch....I guess the show description was a bit unusual so I thought I would give it a try.  WOW I was hooked on the first episode and not one episode has been the least bit boring, I am having a hard time spacing them out.<br /><br />The show's theme song is also catchy, I downloaded it on my MP3 player.<br /><br />I hope Season 3 becomes available to Prime members soon!!<br /><br />So in summary, this show gets a 10 star instead of 5!!!
B00DQHZZ0O|5.0|Received this today..Nervous thinking about installing on camera as I often mess up.<br />I followed the instruction carefully and it is perfect.  You can't wing it,  you need to follow instructions.<br />I have the Sony jacket case..lcjrxc/b, with the adapter on lens I can snap the two snaps on the bottom, when I put the filter on I can only snap one snap.  Not a deal breaker for me...I'll figure out how to keep the case closed with some sort of tie when filter is on..
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|took a bit to get into- but well worth it in the end.  Interesting writing style- being written in letters.
B00915G6MG|5.0|When I want special movies, music, and a lot more Amazon is the place to get it. Be back for more.
B002NVTBOU|5.0|Just like the other Cd of her's that I purchased.  This one is great as well! Most Excellent!  Great vuy!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I was especially interested in this story from a neurosurgeon's viewpoint.  Held my interest and I have told several friends about this story.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|such a great character wit so many quirks.  i really enjoyed this book.  written in the 1st person makes it a bit interesting.
B006YC74E8|4.0|This is the best photo editing app that I have ever purchased. I use it a lot to make pictures for my website. I love the designs and all the fonts that you can add onto your photo. I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for an awesome app.
B00CFO7PK2|5.0|As like the other 2 CD's of her's that I purchased.  This one is great as well!  Enjoyed the sulky, rapsy voice she has.  Great range as well!
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|The BBC does it again!<br />I have been &#34;binge watching&#34; the Torchwood series...it is totally addicting!<br />Amazing story lines and fabulous acting.<br />If you enjoy a creative Sci-Fi adventure you will love Torchwood!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I love the way the story fits together and everything flows, it's amazing how the author fit other people's point of view in the story. I would recommend this book to any Sci-Fi fan! This is a must read book!
0743297334|5.0|Nothing new to add here.  I just wanted to add my 5 star rating to this book.  I'm reading it for the third time.  I've always liked the book; each time I see something new.  I'm always hit by Jake's explanation of the role steers play in calming (and giving a target for aggression) the bulls.  Jake of course, lost his balls in the war.
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|I am so happy I bought this CD.  I first learned about them doing fantastic covers on YouTube and they have excellent original music as well.  I love the whole thing, but I keep playing the first 6 tracks on repeat.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|This is now of my favorites!!! Can you imagine the level of skill it takes to play like this???? AWESOME!!!
B000FC10MU|5.0|I wish I would have reviewed this book immediately after purchase but it's now been over a year. What I can say is that this book lead me into an obsession with the glorious writings of Neil Gaiman and the man himself. His depth of character and story are so intense such that I believe I finished the book in two sittings even though the class was afforded two weeks to read it. If this was suggested to you by a friend or came up in your recommendations, I really would like you to give it a go.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|It is hard to know Jesus without understanding. Judaism and how he was zealot as were<br />many others. It is hard to appreciate what a rebel he was without getting into his culture.<br />It will give greater appreciation for His views on women and regard for gentiles.
B0052REUW0|5.0|Fantastic!!!  I learned so much from this book.  It was like taking his class at my own pace. Read this book.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I loved this Pixar movie, I have related to the minions that follow Gru remind me of the situation today in the real world, and how 3 orphans can touch the heart of the mean, despicable so called powerful persons of today's world..........
B0007KIFGE|5.0|Great movie with alot of action from start to the finish the cast has very good actors which I enjoy.
B004NOCCEG|5.0|We are democracy and we have the power - not Wall Street owned Washington DC, to get change going. I am graduate of economics and it is fact that schools (Oakland University, MI to Harvard) have real agenda to continually deregulate! The instructors all push on students this philosophy since Reganomics. Excellent movie - very important to watch and get understanding who is really behind the crash of 2008. Present day, I think it is ridiculous that Obama is considering Hank Paulson as Chairman of the FED. Gads! Have we not learned a thing. Throw the bums out and put new blood in charge. We need new mind sets in the banks, FED, Wall Street and especially DC. The corruption stinks! Watch this movie - get out from under the ignorance that put us in the position of bailing out banks that were &#34;too big to fail&#34; policy. Watch this movie, please :-)
B00EL8JCGU|1.0|I don't understand how they managed to turn such a wonderful book into such a bad movie. The entire movie feels like one long trailer for an actual movie.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|“But I don’t want to go among mad people,&#34;<br />&#34;Oh, you can’t help that, we’re all mad here. I’m mad. You’re mad.&#34;<br />&#34;How do you know I’m mad?&#34;<br />&#34;You must be, or you wouldn’t have come here.”
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|What can I say that hasn't been said already. I loved the movie but because Paramount decided to screw us by splitting up the extras so you have to buy 5 or 6 different versions to get all the extras is just plain stupid. Does Paramount think we are stupid enough to buy multiple versions? For $19.99 a lot of Blu-Rays come PACKED with extra features. If you want to give us a bare bones (or minimal extras) Charge us a retail price of $14.99. It's a great movie but I would suggest renting the Blu-Ray from a red box (don't stream!) to send Paramount a message that we a) want the blu-ray format to stick around b) that we won't let them screw us like this.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Isn't it time we see more films with strong female lead actors? This series has a very interesting mystery involving clones and provides us with some futuristic questions. I'm betting that  &#34;fact is stranger than fiction&#34;. It gives one pause to think this has certainly already happened somewhere in some country, some state, some grocery store near you. Tatiana is able to make each clone appear very individual and unique even down to the way the cadence of their walk. The filming seems so well done with as many as three or more clones in scenes. It appears to be great coordination of filming or, perhaps, I am not aware of the camera apps that could do this. Thought there should have been more than 10 episodes and hoping to see season 2 soon.

B00EP2PXCY|5.0|The first time I saw Ariana perform was on TV a few weeks ago. I thought wow, not only is this girl really pretty she has a beautiful voice too! I bought her album as soon as it came out. I can't stop listening to it.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|While usually considered a children's book, this is a must read again as an adult, as it is a classic for all ages.<br /><br />Villains, Treachery, Pirates and Hidden Treasure make you quickly turn the pages in anticipation of what new adventure is brewing.<br /><br />But don't be afraid to introduce this to your own  little &#34;Pirates of the Caribbean&#34;, as what can be better than reading a bedtime story that contains the infamous pirate chant:  &#34;....Yo Ho Ho and a Bottle of Rum.....&#34;
B003TTMFCK|4.0|Love this show, but could do without all the steamy relationships and concentrate more about the work that goes on at the hospital!<br />and the diagnosing of the ailments. come on now, people can not have that much fun at work, it is kind of crazy to think that these relationships go on at the workplace as often as on grey's anatomy. Other than that complaint there is some GREAT acting and super plots, love to watch this !
B002MFULQO|5.0|This was made in 1991 and it makes me wonder what was I doing that was more important than seeing this film. Kevin Costner's dialogue is so spot on predicting the events of political threats. How many influential individuals and families have met their deaths in tragic events such as poisoning, plane crashes, boat explosion, heart attacks, etc. All under mysterious conditions. If you think this is far fetched you might agree with the Warren Commission's verdict of the single shooter. There is a documentary &#34;Dark Legacy&#34; that seems to fill in all the blanks and support the JFK film. I think the historical subterfuge of  killing kings and royal families as well as political foes makes JFK's assassination (as well as his brother, Robert, and Martin Luther King) so much more believable. How sad that there was a fork in the road and these murders turned our country into the complete opposite of the best it could have been.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|Great headphones.  Cord is a little long and bulky, but headphones pack fairly compact.  I use them for travel and they fit nicely and are comfortable to wear.
B004SBULWE|5.0|Not many ways to stop programs running on android devices, but this works great!  A must have for your toolbox.
B0034G4OVS|5.0|Really like this movie as it shows just what it would probably be like if you somehow got stranded on a ski lift and nobody knew you were up there. They all went home.... I am glad I don't ski....
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like having the AccuWeather app installed on my tablet computer. Now I can use it to see what the weather is like where I live ;)
6303314015|5.0|the case was a little banged up on the edges but I love this movie so much and it was such a steal.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoy dystopian stories. the idea that we can allow immoral things to occur and find justification for them to a certain point. I get a kick out of it. the main characters story of survival and inner strength was great to read.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|I had only heard Radioactive before and I enjoyed that song. Then a friend of mine was talking about Imagine Dragons and I decided I might as well see what the rest of the cd was like. After listening to it on youtube, I decided to just go ahead and buy the album. While there is one song I cannot stand, the rest of the songs are pretty easy to listen to. It's not the most amazing music ever, nor do most songs have astounding lyrical development, but buying the cd was worth it to me because there are at least 4 songs that I truly enjoy.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|The game is definitely worth downloading its fun killing zombies over And over leveling up and killing more zombies its fun
B0000541B2|1.0|the product arrived in poor condition I is for this reason I did not give good rate the product, was very run
B000KJT8IG|5.0|If you have not seen this movie yet, you need to. This is a classic around the holidays, I probably watch it 12 times.  Have the matching moose mugs, getting ready to throw it back in!
B00E3BK0QQ|3.0|I really love playing these types of games, but for some reason this one just did not click for me. I played in casual mode but there still was no indication of what to pick up in each scene or what to do. I thought there would be more help in each scene, however most of the locations were static and had no sparkles.. I randomly tapped my way through several scenes and was able to get many inventory objects. Then I did the same thing when trying to figure out where/how/when to use the objects.<br /><br />The story was a nice change from all the zombie and demon ones of late, and I did like how much there was to do. However, after the free part ended,  it costs $4.99 to continue! Why are these games becoming so expensive?<br />In the words of Simon Cowell - \\"it was like trying to chop down a tree with a banana\\", in other words, not going to happen! If the price were lower I think many more people would buy it.
B00E5Q1LTY|1.0|Into Darkness is a fantastic movie that I would give 5 stars, however, the sound quality on the AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO is awful.<br /><br />I have soundbar and base that deliver very good sound. Even with the volume on max, most of the movie was barely audible. I couldn't hear any of the dialogue that wasn't being screamed.<br /><br />This is not the first time I have had this problem Amazon Instant Video.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun never ending and not just for kids my parent have loved it since I introduced them
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game but you should make it so Huber board does not run out.  Ps. This is awesome.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|My 5-year-old daughter is a massive Studio Ghibli fan (as are my wife and I), and this has been a favorite since it first came out in the theaters.  We had a DVD copy lost, so this was a late birthday gift for my little one.<br /><br />We opted for the dual format set because we have BR at home but only DVD in the minivan, and every good child-appropriate film must be playable in the van... and as much as I'd like to, I haven't been allowed to install an HD system there!<br /><br />In reaction to other viewers...<br /><br />1st, not of the same that Miyazaki-sama quality.  You know what?  Live with it.  This film was intended to be for younger audiences, and it CAPTIVATES THEM!  And even old farts like me still like it, too.<br /><br />2nd, no Japanese audio on the Blu-Ray disc.  Uh, not sure what you ordered, but mine came with English, Japanese, and French on both the BR and DVD.  We've watched it in both (I prefer Japanese, the kids do not) and both of those soundtracks are perfect on the BR, and I've confirmed that the DVD plays both, as well.<br /><br />Good set, great film, I can't do more than recommend!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|My interest was in sending browser data to a larger screen with the Chromecast.  I saw that it could do so from the Chrome browser and ordered one.  When it came, I discovered that you really can not send anything from an Android tablet or phone other than Netflix, Youtube and Google Play.  Turns out that while Android support is touted and Chrome support is touted, you need to dig deep to discover that they don't support Chrome on Android, only Windows.  Basically, it made the device worthless to me.  Mea culpa, I should have been more diligent in research rather than believing the ads.  Read carefully to make sure it does what you want, because it does not do that much.
076790592X|5.0|This book is a really great piece to read. I got the book for less money than my school book store. Amazon beat the prices on 4 out of 5 of my books.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a fun game, my brother and I play a lot together, and we run into Redstone blocks a lot. Are they going to add Redstone compatibility anytime soon?
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I am still playing with it. I am taking a lot of &#34;selfies.&#34; It is awesome. it is a great addition to your kindle. Buy it you will love, love love it as much as I do.
B00C5R8364|5.0|This book is classic Forsyth. I have read everything he has written and thought he was done.  This is a quick read and it moved at a good pace. If your a Forsyth fan like me it's a must read.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Whatever your &#34;religious&#34; beliefs  (if any at all), these principles could change the world~one human being at a time :)
B00EI6E17A|5.0|After a sub-par second album, Lady Gaga is back with Applause.  Catchy, fun, and original.  A much better showing than Born This Way.
B002JODUI4|4.0|I purchased this album and Random Album Title at the same time, and this one is definitely my favorite out of the two. The songs on here are a little more dynamic, I think, and they stand out more than deadmau5's previous release. I listen to electronica / dance / DJ mainly when I'm working out, and the first four tracks of For Lack of a Better Name are pretty awesome when you're exercising. \\"FML\\" has a strong, driving beat that's perfect for psyching yourself up to do some work. The album starts losing steam around track 5 (\\"Bot\\"), and the next few tracks don't do that much either, so I usually skip them and go straight to \\"16th Hour\\" or \\"Strobe,\\" which was one of the songs that originally got me into deadmau5. It starts off slow but builds up pretty quickly and manages to stay interesting through the whole track, which is nearly 11 minutes long.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to get the MP3 album with the Amazon bonus track, which is a frantic-sounding Sub Focus remix of \\"Ghosts N Stuff.\\" I personally love it. I'll run to most of this album, slow down to a walk at the end of \\"Strobe,\\" then I'll finish off by sprinting like an out-of-control maniac to the Sub Focus remix until I'm out of breath and feeling pretty exhilarated. So yeah, absolutely worth it if you can find a version with the bonus track.
B000FC10MU|5.0|My first Neil Gaiman!  Totally worth it... the beginning sucked me in completely.  Great read for anyone!  I loved it.
B00D2K40WY|3.0|The only glitches that I find in this application is the following below::<br />-I get that this production needs to make money, but why, why do you only get three choices of each or else you pay two dollar for your for-fun application. You guys where smart enough to make this game work, so your obviously smart enough to get some OTHER sucker deals<br />- Another thing I just cannot latch onto, great game, realistic preps; But did you have to make acme pimples? This is a game where princess three year olds play on, let's make this fun, and not all sorry. I , myself think it's a bit over board and gross. The same for the eyebrows. I say this for all the games you have produced.<br /><br />Over all, you have produced a very fine application.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is GREAT. It has amazing graphics and it feels like you actually own your own horse. If you are a fan of houses then I recommend that you get this app. Best thing is that the app is free!
B00915G6MG|5.0|I have not watched it as yet however is well packaged. will not be watching when cote de pablo leaves the showi<br />Ziva and Tony makes the show most likely the show will be cancelled after the 11th season

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Was a very good read . I amazed at the human nature to survive. I'm glad Jayce<br /> shared her story.
B000GOU4M4|5.0|I watch this movie all year long all though its probably most watched at Christmas time. Its just one of those movies that gets funnier each time I watch it.
B00873GRU4|5.0|a great read all three books...could not put it down...well written...thrilling...excellent storylines...good characters...will be a block buster movie..this guy can write...have read the whole 3 books in the series and they are consistantly perfect...read it now!
B0016YBFZ8|4.0|I have seen this before but its been along time since I saw the uncut version.  It was good to see the movie the way it was made.
B003G94BZC|5.0|Not quite as good as the original, but will do in a pinch, it is still Dr. Who? afterall, is it not?
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This Google Chrome Cast Player looks good on papper !! I wasted way to much time trying to get it working !!! It showed on my TV that it was connected. I have a Google Chrome book so it should have been easy. If it looks to good to be true........  I do however Love my acer ChromeBook
1400052181|5.0|Should be a mandatory text for anyone in the medical profession. Well written easy to read hard to put down. Purchased a copy for mr OR Staff
1611761433|2.0|I heard NPR do an interview of Michael Pollan & he was very interesting. And perhaps there are some places in the book where he is interesting also, but it is so long that he appears to be entertaining himself rather than imparting information to the reader. (in this case listener). I quit after one disk and will donate it to the library.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love this product SO much I'm thinking about buying another one for back up. I'm able to get my camera and take lenses in the same bag. Also the straps are SO soft its like its not even on. A MUST HAVE!!!!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|If you like Uno you'll love this game. The only negative thing is you wait 45 minutes at a time for free scratch off coins or pay for more credits in order to play. I'm patient so it doesn't bother me.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Yes. I love Shatner (wooden acting and all), Nimoy and the rest of the original crew. However, the last two movies of the new brand are absolutely great. Nothing lacking here. Great action, great storyline with the typical &#34;logic&#34; vs &#34;passion&#34; of Spock vs Kirk.. Beautifully done. I am looking forward to the next installment.
B009XWD02G|1.0|This app would not download for me. It sat there for hours with no progress. This is the first time i have had any trouble of this kind from any app.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Loved this one...it was fun I love these ho/ mystery games . I like having to put the puzzle together figure out when where and how it all goes together....so if your looking for a great way to pass some time give it a try.
B00114RKT8|4.0|An inspiring story of a life dedicated to eradicating one of the greatest evils ever committed by man on man.Abraham Lincoln and the American Civil War may have ended slavery in America, but William Wilberforce was the driving force to end the slave trade years earlier in England. This fact is often overlooked and the film makes a strong effort to correct his oversight in the American view of the end of slavery. If our government had followed Wilberforce's lead, the Civil War might never have occurred and countless lives saved, those lost in war and those lost in the evil of slavery.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|I liked season two  and season three the best what a great combo of characters, I only wish they could have found a better way to end the 4th. season.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I am only on level four but it is a timed game which I normally don't like but this game is well put together and holds your interest.  I have been able to play each day getting the bonus without buying coins.  I will say that you can run out of crystals very quickly if you don't chose Wisely.  Great game!
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|The menu on this disc does not work on a Blu-ray player. I was able to start the entire DVD, but not make any specific selections. Something is wrong. Not sure if I will return it, I feel like this is the manufacturer's error. What a disappointment. I loved watching the show, but I wanted to be able to skip through certain parts or go back and watch others. Very strange and disappointing. Otherwise, her show is AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!!
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|In the tradition of the &#34;Quatsi&#34; trilogy, Ron Fricke has designed a powerful film.  It is gorgeous to look at as well as powerful in its imagery.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Grew up about 50 miles north of Bakersfield, great to hear music from home that I grew up hearing. Highly recommend.
B002OTO38K|4.0|Very funny, with great acting by Fellicity Huffman.  Good story that develops well enough to pull most anybody in despite the awkwardness of the subject matter.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Surprised it did not do better at the box office.  Intense, maybe a bit too much for some.  Excellent adaptation.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised when I started reading the City of Bones book.  It caught my interest immediately and has kept it so far.  Once I started reading it I immediately bought the rest of the series and have not regretted it!!
B003U4UPHG|5.0|I love all the twists and turns the story takes.  I also love the vignettes about each character that add depth tot he story.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Everyone should read this. They might just find a little of themselves in there too and some good friends as well. Fantastic. Have already re-read it.
B002VUFKG6|2.0|It was just not what I had expected, there fore I did not like this book by the author much
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I think the second book is just a good as the first book!  There is always something going on, non-stop!!  I enjoy this series because after a long day at work I can relax and simply enjoy the story as it unfolds!
B004H7V6C8|4.0|Bought this for my three year old Son for him to have at John Williams night at the Hollywood Bowl.  I didnt want him to have a full size lightsaber, as I didnt want him hitting anybody with it by accident.  This little lightsaber was great.  Its not the most solidly build thing in the world, but good enough for a three year old to hold up during the playing of the Star Wars theme.  There are two colors, red and blue.  He likes the blue better as it seems to stand out more.  Overall we were happy with the lightsaber and putting it together was sort of fun as well since we were able to do it together.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The Kite Runner is one of my favorite books. Khaled Hosseini has written another enlightening page turner. You will not be disappointed.
0240815807|4.0|I read another mixing book from a series and although it had some value to it, it wasn't really what I needed. This book tells you not only what to do when mixing, but why. I've been mixing part-time for over 30 years and I was self-taught, so this helped me understand the goals of what you're trying to accomplish when mixing a commercial quality production.
B000021YQV|5.0|Excellent album. It took a few listens for me to get used to the screaming, but once I did it easily became one of my favorites.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Oblivian was actually pretty good.  My wife and I both liked it a lot.  Not sure why it got such terrible reviews.
B005DJREJS|5.0|I found this to a silly, but funny show. I've put it on my watch list to watch other episodes.
B005H9B44A|5.0|The movie had a lot of action to keep the movie watcher entertained......the characters played each role very well and believable..
159463176X|5.0|Hosseini does not disappoint.  I think this may be my favorite of his 3  - deeply moving, tragic yet inspiring.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great. Once I noticed that it needed to run on window7 or windows 8, it down loaded fast and was working in minutes.tried window vista and it needn't work on it.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I think the old version was much easier to navigate and you should give us the option to go back to older version.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Fun game to play, but if you aren't a Facebook user you find yourself not being able to collect items in each room that are gifted by being a Facebook user. Played over 200 cards and still haven't collected those items in one room alone. Don't punish those for not using Facebook and this would be a 5 star game
B008Y6YCB0|4.0|I was a bit skeptical that I would like this movie.  Gwyneth Paltrow did a good job with the English accent and I can honestly say, this was a good movie.  Love this type of movies
B003G4W49C|4.0|I really liked the action of the story and was extremely intrigued the whole way through, but the end just fell short for me.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|Interesting and engaging from start to finish. Difficult to put down. The author is a creative and an imaginative writer.
0345505387|5.0|This was not at all what I expected, but I was pleasantly surprised. Have read it often and it reminds me of the days longago when I was addicted to comic books.
140006922X|4.0|In this book the author attempts to tease out historical facts about Jesus of Nazareth from the biblical Jesus of the Christian faith. He points out that there is very little historical information about Jesus outside of the Bible - Flavius Josephus being a rare if not the only ancient author to fleetingly mention Jesus in his `Antiquities'. Consequently, the gospels are what remain. After pointing out that these contain many inconsistencies, fabrications and fictional stories - these, apparently, to artificially attribute to Jesus the characteristics necessary to satisfy certain religious requirements - he proceeds to extract as much historical information from them as possible. Given that he pointed out that the gospels are unreliable as historical documents, that they were written decades after the events that they describe and that many of them were written in light of ones that already existed (hence a lot of copying/repetition), it is unclear to me why the author has put so much weight on them in his quest for historical facts.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I did enjoy this book, particularly because it contains a lot of documented history of the period. The author is clearly very knowledgeable in his subject matter. His prose is clear, friendly, free of specialized jargon, lively, quite accessible and engaging. The book should appeal mainly to those who have an interest in the history of religion - in this case, Christianity. For me, the bottom line is whether the author was reasonably successful in separating the historical Jesus from the Jesus of Christianity. In my non-expert opinion, the author did his best, but for the reasons cited above, I wonder if doing this convincingly is at all possible.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is the wonderful word of God in so many forms! The format and styling of the app is simple, and although I have been unable to 'ever' create an account with them for additional content, I have access to the God's word on my phone anywhere I go.
1416955070|5.0|Jace is absolutely the sexiest character ever written. Pain-filled and funny. Isolated but loveable. A hero and yet vulnerable. I skim the pages looking for the funny parts. I didn't realize how awesome all the characters were until I saw their zombie impersonators in the movie theater.
0871164566|5.0|I really enjoyed this one. I took it on my summer vacation with part of my jewelry making stuff. Although my materials wasn't from the desired quality at that point of time, I found it very easy to make some of the designs described in the book following the detailed instructions there. I would recommend it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read and feel connected to the characters. This book has made me see my life in a different way, and has changed the way I feel about ny friends. I hope that all who get to read this book love it as much as I did and who ever hasn't read it reads it before they die. This is a must read book for anyone
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I am glad they finally re-released a kindle version so that I could access it on my phone. I would never have taken the paperback with me everywhere.<br /><br />The formatting is still a bit off; small spelling issues but the overall fix from the original mishap in formatting several years ago is vastly improved!<br /><br />Thank you to whomever finally fixed this version. I had all of the other books in the series but had to wait years for #2 to come back.<br /><br />**About the book: Wonderful fantasy story with rich characters and great detail. Not quite as over the top detailed as a Tolkien story, or Robert Jordan nonsense, but appropriate and enticing.
B00EL8I8IS|5.0|This movie was criticized by many before it even came out....it was called a flop before it even came out.  They were proven wrong.<br />The book was great but making a movie strictly on short stories....meh.  The one thing that I do agree with the critics....the PG rating held this movie back....but not enough to knock it back a star.<br />Listening to reviewers complain about airplane crashes and the \\"cure\\" kind of puts you in the mind of these 1star reviewers.......The Undead walking around biting people...sure----Surviving an airplane crash...NEVER!!!!
B000002AGN|2.0|time out is great... the rest of cd is garbage.... dave brubeck is a one hit wonder... the rest of his music gives you a head-ache
B007CEWR62|5.0|I have all of Secret Garden's music.  I consider myself a huge fan.  There are very few musical groups (in my opinion) that can capture feelings of joy, sorrow, wonder, love, and energy.  I never tire of listening to any of their songs because they always bring out in me, a child-like love for the music.  I know, this all sounds a bit corny but this is the music for me.  I really don't care about the reviews of their recent releases.  I listen to each song individually and separate it from all of the rest.  Each song is unique, stands on it's own, and deserves individual attention.  So let's give Secret Garden some room shall we?  Long Live Secret Garden!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I'm a fan of iron man so this is amazing its like being iron man but in a game I love this game so much
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A moving and realistic story about being different and not only surviving, but flourishing. It was like a salutation to kindness. An inspiration.
B000002L80|5.0|talking heads best cd... why some of these songs arent on the greatest hits cd is mind boggleing. so for complete talking heads you need best of cd plus this one.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Great storytelling from an author I admire. Suspenseful up to the last page. I recommend this to anyone interested in espionage and pursuit.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is so much fun! it's not like the other room escape games this one is much better! more things to find and manipulate and puzzles to solve. can't wait for more rooms!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is fun and challenging. I just wish the lives and gold bars  accumulated faster. I recommend this to anyone who likes fast moving puzzle games.
B003CR9BYE|2.0|i was hopeing for better music.... girl from ipenema was good as always but then really nothing memerable on rest of cd.... id save your money and just get ipenema on different sinatra cd... id pass on this... really nothing worth remmembering on this.
0792160347|5.0|Highly underrated movie with a terrific soundtrack!<br />Very dark and a great flick that highly entertains!<br />The music alone from Giorgio Moroder is worth the experience
B005ZB91KY|4.0|I am not usually into super hero movies, but this one had a good story line and enough action without being too graphic.  Decent movie.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|It was mind boggling to read this book knowing that the author didn't know me, anything of my struggle nor of the internal dialogues and arguing that goes on between my ego and my Self.  He doesn't even know I exist.  Then how was he able to write a book that felt as if it was written for me?<br /><br />I'll never know. And when you're done reading this book, maybe you'll ask yourself the same question.
B000002I53|1.0|this gave me a headache from the first song by the 3rd song i was ready to eject and throw out the window...its just a bunch of noise...absolutly the worst cd i have ever heard.
