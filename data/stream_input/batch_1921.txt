B008HK3XKO|4.0|This was as good buy for my Kindel Fire. It is very easy to place the Jindle Fire HD in.
0812993357|2.0|Like others here, I became introduced to Coddington through the movie 'The September Issue'. In that film, she was far more interesting than Anna Wintour so I was hoping the book would be just as interesting.<br /><br />Perhaps it is for a different demographic. To me, the book was interesting, but not interesting enough to keep my attention. I don't know what I was exactly expecting, but 400+ pages was a little much for this subject.<br /><br />I suppose there are those who would find it riveting, but I was not one.  All in all it wasn't horrible. The 2 stars is for my interest level and the length, not as much the style or subject.  There's something for everyone, but I'm not that someone.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|It is one of the first apps i download on every device supported. It is easy to use and offers streaming or download of songs from your locker.
B0043P10CA|5.0|Love the first disc and i have lent this out to people who hear it in my car.  They always give it back saying they love it.  Just good quality music.
034580404X|4.0|I have read the series multiple times. I like to read all kinds of books, and this definitely does not replace my all time favorite book (Pride and Prejudice), but I enjoyed it and I will read it again sometime. I think it's different and I like that it was written by a woman. That said, if you are offended by lots of sex, unconventional sex or erotica in general, this is NOT for you. I would describe the series as a modern romance with an odd beginning. My sister, who just started reading it, told me that it was not what she expected, but she would keep reading.
030758836X|5.0|\\"Gone Girl\\" is definitely one of my favorite books. It did take a couple of chapters to get into it, but once I was in, I was stuck! I couldn't put it down. The writing was fantastic and the plot was exciting! I have reccommended it to so many people. If you want a good read, pick it up. It doesn't matter what kind of person you are (male or female), all will enjoy.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I think that this app is awesome! I hope that they make more games like this and add more places to unlock.
B006LSZECO|4.0|What a different book, it kept me engaged the whole time!  So many twists and turns in the plot line and many questions still at the end.  Loved it!
B0064SHI9I|5.0|Amazon app store has old version. Developer was helpful in getting me the latest to work on my Galaxy S3.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I was a little leary of the quality of material after looking at a $12 similar item in a local baby store.  This product is cheaper and much nicer and sturdier.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is a great book on many levels. I love the fact that it is simple, yet relatable. It was completely heart-breaking, yet heart-warming at the same time. Bad things happen to everyone. Sometimes we aren't ready to deal with and/or deal with those things so we repress them. This is a great coming of age story about a boy who deals with love and loss on an epic scale. I think this will be a favorite for a long time.
0307341550|3.0|After coming off of the high of \\"Gone Girl\\" I was excited to read another book from the same author. I thought it would be hard to compare the novels, but there was just no comparison. You can tell this is her first book, since \\"Gone Girl\\" was so much better developed. \\"Sharp Objects\\" is an entertaining book, but would only recommend if there wasn't something better to read. It was just ok.
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|This is a great game with clear graphics and a good story line.<br />I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good mix of puzzles along with hidden object scenes.There is a glitch in this game and I am now frozen at the shed. I click where I am supposed to and nothing happens.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed this book, and the series from start to finish. I became curious when I heard that some coworkers were really angry about the success of these books. Naturally I had to invest some time into this! The story pulled me in right from the start. Ana is a likeable character & I think every girl can relate to her in some aspect. This book starts off on their honeymoon with just the two of them having the time of their lives. It appears that they have overcome many obstacles, that is until they return to reality. Who hasn't experienced something amazing only to return to work on Monday, bills, family drama, the mundane. Christian Gray is any woman's dream well almost- maybe not him exactly, but how about how he makes Ana the center of his universe? He doesn't even glance at women who obviously ogle him everywhere they go. All his admiration, love, and sex is for this woman who happened to fall into his office one day. Meeting her completely changed his world. It's not an easy adjustment for either party, but something that is worth working at! It was refreshing to read about how in love two people are, and no other person could shake that. I don't want to give away the entire book here, but the last part of it is from Christian's perspective. His childhood is heartbreaking, it's inspiring how far he grows & how successful he is considering. Seriously I never wanted the story to end.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Really enjoyed this book.  I couldn't put it down.  I am gonna get the third one now!  Long live the Mockingjay!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|World of Goo is a great game on simply every platform. Great music, gameplay, art style, even narrative (if you read the signs from the sign painter).
B004FHCH9Q|5.0|The acting and the storyline are the best. This is right up there with the &#34;Usual Suspects&#34; on my list
B008AK8FHM|4.0|It was interesting, but not enjoyable reading.  I wanted more description of Heaven, but just got a taste.  Most of the book seemed to explain why we should believe it due to the fact he was a brain specialist.
1594744769|5.0|This is such a wonderful book! It pulls you right in and doesn't let go! I got this and. Wouldn't put it down until I got to the last page. The photos add a lot to the story. This book is a real work of art!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Best alarm clock ever, and by best I also mean worst. You can program this thing to be the most annoying, horrible alarm clock ever. But I promise it will wake you the heck up.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Movie was in great shape, shipped fast, got it here in time for Christmas, sister was very pleased.  No scratches or damages!
B009NPKTN6|5.0|You'll want to watch it again and again.  The songs are awesome, and the actors are all awesome!  Great movie.
B000001FG5|5.0|Another great album from a great group.<br />All the tracks are terrific - it's been said that one or two of these tracks would have been No 1s if released as singles.<br />I definitely recommend it to any Bee Gees fan.
1449305172|5.0|Ash Maurya's describes principles and practices you'll find applicable to products at any stage of their lifecycle. And, it's not only for start-ups!<br /><br />As Ash explains it, the meta-process--document your plan, identify risks, and continually test your plan--forms the framework for a team's validated learning. Much more than a buzzword, validated learning has deep and sustained value. Pay special attention to the chapters on how to validate and verify your learning qualitatively.<br /><br />This book is compelling. You'll trust the author, you'll enjoy his examples, and you'll delight in this lean canvas to structure your work.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved it! I'm not much into the sexual books, but this one actually had a fantastic story line! Definitely a must read!
B0042UEU8M|4.0|This movie sent warm feelings through my body and has to be one of my favorite movies of all time. This story has meaning so deep down its unrealistic.
0792164903|5.0|Movie was in great shape, shipped fast, got it here in time for Christmas, sister was very pleased.  No scratches or damages!
0736092269|4.0|Overall this has been a great tool in piecing together workouts in the gym. I do pair it with other resources but it's a great asset. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I don't consider it the be-all/end-all book for weight training. However I highly recommend it.
B001P5M7QE|5.0|As we flew in their circus the comic geniuses known as Monty Python brought sketch comedy to a new level before making films. Though they made only four films that would be \\"official\\" Monty Python movies (Now for Something Completely Different, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, The Life of Brian, and The Meaning of Life) they worked together on several other occasions in stage, film, television and even video games. Of all Monty Python works of any kind, \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\" is by far the most quoted and remembered. This does not always mean a film is the best of a series, in fact often it is only the lowest common denominator, but in this case in my humble opinion this is the finest work they ever did. Many people, myself included, needed to see the film several times before catching each line since much of their rhetoric would be delightfully overcast by laughter. And like all great comedies it is best seen with friends. It is truly a gift to enjoy being bathed in the laughter of friends, and \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\" is in this way a truly precious gift.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a fun, addicting, problem solving app. It starts off a bit too easy, but quickly moves to more challenging puzzles. Enjoying it very much.
B00297FEUI|5.0|It's very good deal. It's good expédition to france. It's very Good product. It's very Good sings. Thank you very much
B009WUBERW|4.0|A worthy sequel to the original film, this brings all the big action movie stars into one place and even has bigger roles with action for Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger compared to their non-action cameo appearances in the original.<br /><br />Full of action, explosions, shooting of bad guys lead by Jean-Claude Van Damme, classic dialogue lines and a lot of jibes at each others past movies. Unfortunately Jet Li takes a back seat in this with only a brief showing at the start of the film but all the other characters and more make up for it in the rest of the film.<br /><br />If you aren't looking for a deep film but are instead after some high impact action instead then this film will fill that void where you can just switch off and let the film take you along for the ride without much thought.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Movie was in great shape, shipped fast, got it here in time for Christmas, sister was very pleased.  No scratches or damages!
B0064NTZQ2|2.0|Here is the deal, maybe I just didn't get it or it was really a bad movie.  I LOVE Ryan Gosling and normally he can do no wrong.  One person described his character well, little to say and no personality.  SPOILER ALERT:  He has no name in the movie, I kid you not.  It is very slow, violent, dark and somewhat depressing.  The love interest part of the movie has no spark and doesn't leave you feeling that there is a point to it.  There are some good car chase scenes but that is about all I can say that was good.  After the movie ended I was left wondering why I had wasted two hours of my life.  This movie is not for everyone; if you like it dark, like it violent and like being left with an uneasy feeling at the end, then this is for you!
B000002LFZ|5.0|When your kids ask you who your favorite artist is..... undoubtedly, many of us will list Fleetwood as one of our favs.  Great purchase for yourself or as a gift.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Came quickly and on time and damage free. I was worried after getting scammed trying to buy the same product so I was very happy when this arrived :)
8862933177|3.0|As a film enthusiast, I will be saddened when I have to pick only 6 moves per letter of the alphabet (Six entry slots per letter),<br />However, aside from that, the book looks great, nice matte with some gloss film/movie tools design all over the cover.<br />Of course, being a Moleskine, the book feels sleek and intellectual. It is the most right environment to keep film notes, techniques, maybe shots and angle, all written down in one elastic band kept notebook.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Book was amazing!!  Nicholas is an amazing writer!! Can't wait to read another one of his books!! This book would bring hope and happiness to many readers.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Well, it's solitaire.<br />It's free and it's fun...and sort of maddening.<br />The ads stink but it is free.<br />Worth it for the occasional game.

B009MF56GC|5.0|I do not usually come across a sequel that beats it's original, with the exception of the Expendables 2. More Explosions, big guns, knuckle-dusters, and the biggest action heroes. This is the best action flick i have seen in the last few years.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie!!!!! I could watch this movie over and over and never get tired of it!! Great actors and great story!!!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|this is a really fun game. However I have had to repeat several missions due to the game not saving automatically. there is no manual save setting
B001N1DPDE|4.0|Well my first impression of the knife out of the box was &#34;Man this is one stout knife!!&#34;  I like the feel of it but it is by far the heaviest knife I have ever owned at this length.  But this is one mean looking knife!! Out of box sharpness is not great.  It will not shave arm hairs so I will be touching this up a bit.  I will also be putting a wooden handle on it as well for a better in hand feel.<br />  My first impression of the sheath..... SUCKS!!!!  very hard to get the knife in and out.  Don't know if this will lessen over time but not looking forward to finding out.  I will be making or buying a leather sheath ASAP!<br />  But overall this will be a very good addition to my survival kit. After all it is a KA-BAR so you cant go wrong with this one.
B005R32L66|5.0|I use it on my pc, so got it for my Nextbook tablet.  works just fine, although the notifications are a bit annoying
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I like it when a book leaves you wondering until the end.  I also like to skip back and forth from the past to the present.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I downloaded this app and its terrible, it only shows about ten posts in the news feed and that's it, you cannot look at anymore, there's not even a choice to look further. I do not like this app, unless it's fixed I will stick to going on my facebook on my mobile. :-/
B000WKWDQM|5.0|I've been a huge Manson fan for a very long time and out of all his albums I believe this to be the best album!

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Amazing book to read for all ages . Lots of funny things to look at and read. Needs more of this series
B002ZG980U|5.0|I'd seen it before, so knew what to expect.  Not quite the same on a 42 inch screen as in the theater, but still impressive
030758836X|1.0|This book hardly merits review. I just wanted to let people know it's not as wonderful as you've been led to believe, and also to spoil the ending. Most of the reviews I read of this book were in Entertainment Weekly, including Rob Bruner's inclusion of the book in the \\"Best of 2012\\" issue.<br /><br />This book is only the best of 2012 if by \\"best\\" you mean most profoundly disappointing, with the least satisfying ending of possibly any book I've ever read (at the end, after the failure of her nearly perfectly executed plan to frame her husband Nick for her murder, monster sociopath \\"gone girl\\" returns home, and Nick decides to stay married to her; I feel no compunction about spoiling this POS).<br /><br />While I wasn't framed for murder, I do feel victimized by the press on this incredibly bad book. Bye, Gillian Flynn. Bye, Rob Bruner.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Not only is this a great beginners cook book, and but it is an excellent guide on how to learn more efficiently.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It was very helpful and is a great lifestyle change. It was very detailed in how to accomplish this.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I think this is the third or fourth time I have read this book and I got more out of it this time than ever before.  I think the first time was in 1940 or '41 while I was in Jr. High School.  This was my first read on Kindle and it was a pleasant surprise as to the ease of set up.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like minecraft in all versions but on Kindle Fire it won't let me connect to friends. Everytime I try to join a game it just scans. Please explain how to do this so I can connect with friends

B007UW9WOQ|5.0|Watching this documentary is truly moving.  Jiro Ono is such a talented sushi maker and learning his sushi making process from buying and picking out the fish, to mastering the art of rice making... it's all so wonderful to watch.  I highly recommend seeing this film.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|My son loves it because he loves Star Wars but I prefer the original angry birds. It's neat to see the birds as Star Wars characters.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have Facebook on other products so it is not new to me. Same here as on other products used. Title: Facebook
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Oh my gosh.  This story makes me want to drop my whole life and go on a crazy adventure.  My only complaint is how long the book is.  If you like &#34;Catch Me If You Can&#34; and other stories like that, you'll love this.
B008MEM24S|5.0|this game is awesome! my friend is addicted to Perry and this game is full of fun adventures and challenges
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|She plays this all the time!!  I thought it might be too young for her, but since its Little Pets, it doesn't matter!
B009LROCJI|5.0|My *die hard* classical music friends poo poo Vivaldi's Four Seasons, which I admit has been overplayed and exploited, but I'm happy to see that Max Richter has done a great job of enhancing the original piece, while adding his personal stamp, depth and feeling to the piece.  Richter has kept certain parts true to the original, while other parts sound more like Variations on a Theme by Vivaldi.  Like a lunatic, I've listened to this in the car, at work, and at the gym.  A new take on an old classic.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|They are wonderful together and I've loved them since BGT.  I hope they stay Toghther for a long time. I want to see what they are like in the years to come.

B008458O3S|5.0|This &#34;game&#34; can be very frustrating, but that is part of the enjoyment. You can make the trains run on tracks as complicated as you want and when you succeed you feel good at solving the latest challenge. The &#34;game&#34; is good at stimulating the analytical parts of the brain.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|This is a brilliant piece of original work, and, predictably, it seems to infuriate many readers. Why? Mostly, I think, because Taleb's observations are deadly accurate and he takes a particular delight in ruthlessly pointing out the cluelessness of most academics when it comes to understanding how complicated systems really work -- how real systems not only survive adversity but in fact depend on it. Why does any of this matter? Because, whether we like it or not, we exist in a universe of complicated systems -- all forms of life, the atmosphere, the oceans, tectonic plates, the solar system -- and when we fail to acknowledge this and its implications, we tend to devise &#34;cures&#34; that are worse than the so-called &#34;diseases.&#34; In a grand sense, the future of our society depends on understanding this book's message; at a smaller level, the book ensures you will have something interesting to talk about at your next cocktail party.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great fun would play it again and again I was a little bit slow but this is my first time I just got my kindle
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Oh please, this movie is made for those that love the classic, dance the present and can high pitch the future with confidence and passion. So for those that are wanting a good plot, or a good ...... I do not know, I'm not a film student! I am a music lover n this is what evolution, resolution, innovation meets passion without technology. There is no replacing technology, yet for my generation, there is no replacing your voice. If you got sing it.... pitch perfect!!

B005ZMTYBY|3.0|I bought this because my fiancé had not yet seen this classic film. It was a spur of the moment purchase, but I was disappointed that I found it on Netflix later. Oh well!
B008OHV5HS|4.0|I haven't listened to Threshold for a long while, probably since the early 90's. (Darn I'm getting old). ANyway, I like this album, I could see listening to it in the car on a long car ride. I'll probably get more threshold albums, but I wasn't so blown away that I thought it deserved 5 stars.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I enjoyed all three of these books. I think some of the reviews are way too critical. It was a very &#34;exciting&#34; book. I was ready to purchase the next book
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A gripping story expertly written...Hopeless is one of my favorite books ever!  You won't want to put this book down!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|&#34;Trouble with the Curve&#34;<br />We are fans of Clint Eastwood, so thought it would be enjoyable.  We liked it<br />both thought it was slow and did not show the star at his best.  Of course age has a lot to do with that.  As for the content of the movie, we thought it just<br />okay --- kind of a stretch for a story.  Dick and Jane Long
B005AUWXZ0|4.0|well worth the money.. at the time...  good HD blue ray movie...  I bought for the grandboys but I bought a copy for myself too!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I chose this because I enjoyed Fall of Giants, first of the Century Trilogy.  I was equally impressed by the style, further development of some characters from the earlier book and their relationship with new characters set against the developing cold war. Ken Follet takes them from black shirted demonstrations in London to Spain to Berlin, Pearl Harbour and Moscow in a chilling exploration of Fascists, Nazis and Dictators. He manages to include love, laughter and hope - a perfectly balanced book.
B00A2AU0KI|4.0|Movie was good but Amazon streaming is average at best.  Stick with Vudu.  Better video quality and definitely better sound.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I really enjoyed the third book. It was a great way to wrap up the series. I read through all three books quickly as you really want to find out what happens to these characters.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book is historical. Shows how the Germanys really felt. Easy to understand and not drug out and boring. A good read.
B003K16P3M|5.0|The Graceling series is a wonderfully penned adventure! The story will wrap you in a beautifully detailed new world where danger lurks around every corner. You will fall in love with many characters and earnestly loath a few. Kristin Cashore paints an amazing world for you in these long, and delicious reads.<br /><br />Graceling - the story Katsa, born with a special \\"grace\\" for killing, is used by her uncle, King Randa, as his deed-doer. As Katsa matures and rebels, she sets herself on an amazing adventure. She is pulled into a mystery of great importance. Along the way she finds help from a very unlikely source who has some secrets of his own. They set off on a long journey of not only self-discovery, but also a little world discovery as well.....all the way to the nail-biting conclusion!<br /><br />An amazing new world, intrigue, romance, action, mystery, and wonderful characters that pull on your heart. This book has a little bit of everything. I finished it wanting to know more about the new world. Kristin Cashore is very gifted and I look forward to what she has to write in the future!<br /><br />~*~ Rhea

B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is just as good as you have heard. Do yourself a favor and read it now. You owe it to yourself.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I think the book was written well but it was just too disturbing for me. Sorry just not my cup of tea.
B008XBHIEY|2.0|It was kind of blurry, and parts of the picture disappeared throughout the movie. The sound quality was also lacking.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I am so glad I purchased this set, I found it hard to stop watching it was so good.  Loved everything about it, the Actors, the Special Effects, the Storyline was marvellous.  I highly recommend anyone to watch this as I cannot wait for the Season 2 to be released

B003K1EYM6|2.0|I gave the adapter as a gift to a fiend and he began to use it with his iPad, but he gets all the time an error message telling that the device is not supported. I have the same connector and the same iPad model but I bought mine on an apple store and it has no problem with the connection at all.<br /><br />Looking both connectors (mine vs the one I bought here) I noticed that only mine (bought at an apple store) have FCC codes and disclaimers written on it. I really doubt now that the supposed Apple connectors i bought here are Apple hardware at all
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This was a good story. Sometimes all the scientific speak slowed down the story, but still felt necessary to express the magnitude of the main characters situation. I laughed out loud frequently and smiled often at the author's<br /> mildly twisted sense of humor! Overall an enjoyable read!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This book was okay. I felt it was just getting through to the third book. It felt that there was a lot of the same stuff from the first book.
B007UPNA6Y|2.0|Totally ridiculous plot with Implausible characters  Slow pased and by far the worst of the Jack Reacher series.  I think Mr Child was in a hurry to get it out before Xmas.  I will give him one more chance, only because of the previous books.
034580404X|5.0|I would recommend to both men and women of ages 21-70 +.<br />Its light entertaining literature.<br />I found it very amusing and a kinky eye opener!

B000026OWF|4.0|I was under the impression this album was unavailable for some time. Why on earth was that?? My friend hipped me to this jam fest, and i snatched it up. Herbie is the master of funk keyboard excursions, surrounding himself with the top rhythm players, which is everybody on the album-- just a wild ride of rhythm. Funk. get down.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The main characters in this book are teenagers who are living with cancer. I was hesitant to read it at first because I thought it might be too depressing, but not at all. This book is so well written and I was so eager to read through the pages.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|Great tv series for anyone who likes watching mind games, similar to Alfred Hitchcock or Sherlock Holmes.  Always a surprise for an ending.
B005NGKMOU|5.0|This is the best ever telling of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.Sam Shepard is so good in this movie. If you want a western that is more then just gunfights this is it. It tells the story of Butch AFTER the shoot out in Bolivia. Well worth the money.

B0091LS07E|2.0|The reason I bought it was &#34;Brand New Me&#34;  which I love.  However, most of the other songs either had too loud drumming or too much screaming rather than singing.  Sorry, Alicia.  Perhaps, I am from another generation and just prefer Whitney.  I presume young people would probably like it.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|This is a puptastic app for all ages<br />Its a fun and hilarious app that I personally love a lot
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|This game is soo entertaining, it keeps you actively trying to get to the next level. My only concern was the use of mild violence, like when the characters get blasted by explosives. Perhaps not for younger children but still very imaginative. Totally for a grown-up who's still a kid!
B003L77G8I|5.0|Excellent comedy and drama TV series.  Series also has romance to keep viewers interested.  Recommend this series to anyone who likes CSI ot Body of Proof.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Someone gave me a gift certificate for Barnes and Noble so I was going to buy this book there. I book was still three times a much at Barnes and Noble, so I bought the book at Amazon and regifted the gift certificate to someone else. A win /win for me.
B004XZ99LO|4.0|i love cirque du soleil i love 3d i hope to collect all 3d CDS eventually. well worth my investment
B00914JWSW|5.0|What is not to like about.  A beautiful voice with beautiful songs and accompaniment  She hasn't lost touch with the music..
B000N4SHOE|5.0|This was a Christmas gift.  She specifically asked for this and also listed the place where to by it.  Satisfied.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great read!! Right from the first chapter this book catches you and you cannot put it down,  Highly recommend. Enjoy.
B001I45UFC|5.0|I haven't read it since I was a child, I'm reading it to my children now, and it's every bit as magical as it was the first go around.
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|They tried hard to produce to produce a good film but I just couldn't buy into the whole time travel thing.  None of the characters is likeable, even the little boy.  It was a bit disturbing, also.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Another outstanding book by Rick Riordan. It's funny and entertaining and<br /> I couldn't put it down. I would recommend this to 5th graders and over.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Good deal and arrived fast. Got it for my hubby for Christmas He thought it was a great gift to have
B00A757EFW|3.0|It is the original pac man but playing it with touch screen is not great.  It doesn't want to go where you try to take it with touch.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is by far the best way better then the movie! Can't wait to read the next one!!! Definitely read!
0307743659|5.0|This was my first Stephen King book, and I am now a fan.<br /><br />A friend told me I should see the movie (and was blown away that I had NOT seen it), but I like reading the book first.  So I visited my library.  To my dismay, The Shining walked out of my library, and they never replaced it.  I eventually broke down and bought it, and I'm thankful I did.  So to give my congratulations speech, I'd like to thank my friend for suggesting the movie, and thanks to the lowlife who stole it out of my library.  Because of both of you, I have delved into the world of Stephen King.<br /><br />With that out of the way, I really, really enjoyed this book.  First of all, the writing is incredible!  I've always heard King was a gifted writer, but the topics and language always kept me away.  His ability to create characters is second to none.  Second, this book scared the crap out of me while reading it!  If you like horror, this book is for you.  In my opinion, scary things that can really happen (supernatural things and people-going-crazy things) tend to scare me, whereas slasher/killer horror movies don't.  The way he brought the reader into the mind of Jack as it started splitting really unsettled me while reading, but in a good way.<br /><br />All in all, this was a very good starting point for me to enter his world.  This ranks up there as one of the best books I've ever read.
B009DKFST6|4.0|Love the upbeat tempo, makes you want to move. Many songs would be great for a workout playlist.  \\"Don't stop the parrtayy!\\"
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I haven't had much time to play with this game but so far I really like it. Works great on my GN2.
1118232658|5.0|Socialnomics was better than advertised.  I came to know Erik and his book via....social media.  He practices what he preaches, which is refreshing.  About 30 pages in I was ready to recommend this to all of my business contacts & clients.  This is a must read for anyone trying to navigate that overwhelming sea of social media.  Whether you are a beginner or high-level marketing professional, this read will provide you with great insights and ideas.
1451695195|5.0|I chose this rating because it deserves a 5 star in my opinion.<br /><br />I would recommend it to friends of mine who have lost loved ones in the hopes that it brings<br />them some comfort.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Enjoyed the religious comparisons and zoologist outlook on life. The author did an excellent job in creating a  believable story out of an unbelievable circumstance, creating a lovely character, and had an interesting way of reassuring the reader that the story had a good ending. Many quotes had a long lasting impression and thought provoking impact on the reader.
B00007KWHP|4.0|It's brings back memories. when I was a younger I listened a lot. If you listen it now you can feel new and cool.I recomend it.
B004J4WLB4|2.0|I am not sure where this story was meant to go.  It is true that this was a young girl who had no family and been bounced around from one family to another, but I didn't think this was really about anything but flowers.  I do like flowers but not to read an entire book about the subject.
1452110581|5.0|...these poems would probably be a pretty accurate depiction of what they would say.<br />I've seen so many books with misleading titles, but \\"I Could Pee on This: And Other Poems by Cats\\" keeps its promise, there is no need for an additional explanation of the content, it is just that.<br />It may not be Shakespeare or Whitman and the like, and as absurd the premise of poems in cat-tongue is, the \\"heart\\" of this book is terribly endearing. I won't say that the book's for cat owners only, although it would certainly be of advantage, but I think everyone young and old would profit and find joy in it, even if it's just for a brief time (you will have read through it in about 10 minutes, surely).<br />As a proud owner of three wonderful cats, I had a blast reading and laughing through it and suddenly becoming aware that a lot of the things described in Marciuliano's work are capturing the feline nature so well. I also like the occasional colored illustrations of the cats that highlight the mood of the poems quite well.<br />In short: It's a fun little piece to read in your pastime that you can use to ponder what cats are actually thinking about when they're not hungry, chasing mice around or clawing at your face. I greatly recommend it. :)
1449410243|5.0|All three cat owners recognized traits of their cats in this funny funny book...we were laughing out loud and screen shooting pages to send to fellow cat owners.  So funny.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Surprising twists and turns in this book. But overall it was a great read. Led right off the previous two books.
B004XMMSZG|1.0|This is a cool idea, but the Dockboss Air only works for a few minutes with my Bose Sounddock II, then cuts out.  It seems like the vendor has acknowledged an issue with another Bose sound system, so perhaps this is the same issue.
B001R3YRG2|5.0|Falling Down with the actor Douglas in one of his most powerful roles beside The Game as a man on a mission to get back to his little girl's birthday party.  But many people in life can relate to this movie and the impact life has on a person who gets fired, then everything starts to go down around you little by little.  I agree with the critics and other reviwers that the small aspects impact the movie but the main meaning behind the movie is a father who still loves his daughter and wants to be there for his daughter because he feels lost and sad without her in his life.  Personally it's one of my favorite's in my collection of movies that why I gave it a 5 star rating, and would hope you feel the same way about the movie plus there are some fight scenes and couple of good one liners threwout the movie.  So if you like this style of movie and look at the overall picture of the character Douglas plays in the movie then buy this movie and see if it becomes one your favorite's in your movie collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book keeps you sitting on the edge of your chair throughout.  It definitely leaves you hungry for more! I'm looking forward to reading the next book.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. i really wasn't expecting it to be this good. I thought it was a children's game but I was wrong. It is sort of a physics based game with a storyline. Get it, you won't be disappointed! Unless you're looking for a Call of Duty type game. Then this isn't what you're looking for.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I bought Seasons 1 & 2 for myself last year.  Found out recently that my best friend had never watched the show so I just had to buy it for her.  I know she'll love it as much as I did.<br /><br />I'll buy the third season for myself soon.
B008KYOCA2|1.0|I just wanted a basic calendar that I could put memos and reminders on.  This seemed perfect except every time I tried to set a reminder on a date it would put it on Dec. 31st.  I tried a few times and made sure the date was correct but once I hit create it was never on the date I selected.  I looked for a help tool to see if there was a way to fix this and there was none. So its now gone along with the time I wasted on it.
B007K4Q8S2|5.0|I love to knit and the book is quite clear with its instructions.  Plus the condition looked like it was a first edition.  I feel spoiled!<br />6 stars!!!!!!!!!!1
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple Run is a fun game and great when you want to pass some time. The only problem is that a little bit into the game it begins to lag.  This can really mess you up especially if you're at a farther into the game.
1568363931|5.0|This book is very well laid out.  Colorful, easy to read.  You can look at this in Reader Digest form or take the time to do more in depth reading.  It is a wonderful first time Bento cookbook.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|It's visually fantastic. The actual game will only take a few hours to beat, so if your expecting weeks of enjoyment, this is not for you. But you'll definitely be missing out. The game play is great as well.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Nothing to really write home about.  It seems all the funny bits were used in the trailers and previews.  Music was good though and, by the end made the movie.
B001CO42MU|5.0|My niece has been looking all over for this DVD. When I found it I quickly bought it. She was just thrilled when she opened it at Christmas.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|King does it again. Sure it is bulky and a little slow at the beginning but once you get in, buckle up. You'll want to peak at the back and see the end (at least I did but resisted) and when you get there and you don't have a tear and a smile, shame on you!
B009FB3WQ4|1.0|Not only a very technical poor quality but a insane editing of the night.<br />I didn't think possible such a product so ridiculous.......... poor Barbra..... much better when she had the complete control of her artistic work.
B00427W67C|5.0|Love all the extras and love RDJ doing Osiris for the entire cast commentary!  Fun and exciting extras - including make up tests with Les Grossman!
B0091QSNEE|3.0|The game is okay.  It does not lasts long.  There is not a large enough variety of meals to cook.
B005ZUR724|5.0|This is an awesome rpg for a tablet! It's way better than I ever expected it to be! It's worth the money!
B0054R6BFM|4.0|This book is easy to read and pulls you in from the start.  Good for the teen crowd and even for those of us who aren't teens.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 is action packed with some awesome twists. Each episode so far has kept me engrossed and wanting to see the next episode, can't wait until new episodes start back.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved this book much it was very interesting and it was enjoyable and Lot of people should read .
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie is hilarious . . . . .. .<br />Nice having a blu ray and dvd as well .
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great read with unexpected twists, raw emotion, and brutal honesty. The story grabs you and doesn't let you go!!  Highly recommended!
0307346617|5.0|Best book in a long time. The personal narrative is original and feels realistic. Captures humanity's fragility and strength. Movie looks disappointing.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I have always loved Cats and have seen it many times on stage.  This DVD is a great addition to my video library.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This movie has classic Family Guy humor, with a ton of references to pop culture at this point in time.  In 20 years, most of these references will make absolutely no sense, but that's the humor Seth McFarland goes for.  Has some crude humor, and a fun story.  I'd recommend this to any person who already enjoys any of Seth McFarlands other shows.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|First of all let me say that a actually read the  book and this is not a payed person to post......my friend insisted the author payed some one to post her five star reviews. however after reading this book i will say that it is one of my favs. it has twist that you would never expect and it feels so real that anyone can relate to the characters in one point or another.<br /><br />the love that sky  and holder have is just breathtaking it makes me wish that i could experience a love like that. in it  more directed toward older YA so it gets hot in steamy... all in all it is a most read dont pass it by it has teh combination of love,lust,anger,sadness, happiness ...........and lack of technology lol that makes for a perfect book. I couldnt put it down after i started reading...and when i was not  reading it i was thinking about ..............so read it
B004WR125O|5.0|The added functionality of this product on my Onkyo device is amazing. I would recommend this to anyone who cannot connect their receiver to LAN easily.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I use this in a closet with no power and it works<br />very well. Not super bright but  bright enough.<br />The motion sensor is reliable.
0767020308|4.0|I love this story and this is a good version although it is not my favorite version of the story.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I thought this movie was really good.  It was a little slow getting started, but all in all it was worth watching.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty good game. I like that you have to unlock different games with the points that you earn by playing the other games.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Abby's story and Travis is totally unpredictable who old think that I guy so rough and violent can have an endearing heart. His love for his pigeon is so tender and so cute. Truly loved this totally waiting on the next book. Pease hurry.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Great movie, one of my favorite Batman movies, other than the very first one. I rank this one a tie as the best.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|Bought it for a  Christmas gift for our grandchildren.....they loved it.  It is  not great quality, though.....scenes &#34;freeze&#34; in several places.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read it in one day!<br />and can't wait to see what else is in store for Katniss and Peeta
B009NXV2RK|3.0|I have read all Tom Clancy's novels and whilst good this was not in the same league as some of the earlier works but I would still recomment it
B0087EVHTE|5.0|great gamer cpu from intel. I am not overclocking the chip and stock cooler seems fine for now in terms of noise and activity.
B009T3AHDE|5.0|Don't judge this movie by Rpbert Pattinson and Twilight because Rob has proven his acting genious in this Cronenberg film. Need to watch many times to get a better understanding. The Cronenberg commentary was delightful.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book so much! Peeta and Katniss are adorable! (: I would tell anyone to read this book.
B004Q9TYWQ|5.0|One of the best books ever written! You are doing a great job! I hope you write another great book!
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|You cannot help but laugh at this silly movie where Bill Murray is stuck in the same day for something like 10 years. Hilarious from start to finish. This movie is played at least 10 times in my house throughout the year. Sometimes more. Sure to bring a laugh to anyone' day.
B005H29GSI|5.0|I purchase two of these, one for my son and one for his best friend. They're both 5 and addicted to Angry Birds! My son is capable of building/destroying the structures by himself with no problems. The bird shooter can be akward at first, but with a little practice you can have the birds knocking down the pigs in no time! Definitely recommend it - especially if your kids are constantly draining your phone's battery while playing Angry Birds!
1609611543|3.0|I changed my opinion somewhat about this book.  After doing more research, I think Davis is right about the way wheat is grown today.   I've been corrected.    Dr. Jason Fung's book is the best, though, if you want to prevent diabetes 2 and obesity!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I wasn't sure why everyone loved this game so much.  So joining the party late, but totally addicted.  Those damn pigs must be defeated.
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|I purchased the camera app for my Kindle.  I thought I would be able to take pictures with it. The only thing is, my kindle doesn't have an eye on the other side to take a picture!  I wouldn't recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Easy and fast read. Very entertaining which made it hard to put the book down. Loved it and can't wait to read the next one!
B005PTYP70|4.0|Difficult to go wrong with the boxed set of Mission Impossible...feel it will be a hokey, timeless, action classic akin to Dirty Dozen... just good entertainment!
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|One extra star for Best Rendering of Hair in a Computer Animated Feature. As for the rest of my review... well, some folks may somewhat enjoy this thing, but my wife and I just stared at each other when it was over and said in unison, \\"That was kinda sucky.\\"
B000AM2L1O|5.0|My two year old granddaughter loves and cuddles this beautiful baby doll. It's just the right size for her. It has a soft and pliable texture, just right for hugging.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Character development was great.  The Bain character is the toughest villain Batman has ever faced.  Special effects did an excellent job as well.  Very good.
888370536X|4.0|This music notebook is the perfect size for carrying around with you so you can jot down your notes when inspiration strikes. I usually prefer spiral bound notebooks, but the binding on this book is not bad at all. It has plenty of staves, but not a lot of room between if you're looking to write lyrics and chord abbreviations with the melody - just make sure you write small. I often write down ideas with a ballpoint pen, but I found that it was easier to use a fine mechanical pencil or a find point micron pen (so you don't smear) in this book.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Fairly interesting military story about a simple guy. Not much depth or insight. Robotic talk of guns and killing and bar fights.  Too stereotypical.  Felt sorry for his family and wife.
0060234814|5.0|I bought this book for a friend's daughter as Christmas present. The quality of print is good.  I myself have one which I love very much. It is an very inspired story for Christians.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game is high quality both in terms of graphics and of gameplay. Based solely on the icon, title, and brief description, it would be easy to conclude (as I did) that this is a brief combat game of encounters. However, this is a more involved, somewhat complex game and as such the system will require some time to master.<br /><br />In sum, this is a great game -- just don't come to it looking for a quick, short experience.
B0063IH60K|1.0|simple game does not hold my interest but it keeps my husband happy with it .He plays that at night while watching tv
0545128285|5.0|Arrived on time.  The condition of the book is fantastic,  the binding hadn't even been broken.  Not the best book out there, but that's beside the point. I was very impressed by the quality of this book and I would recommend to friends and family. Thank you for a great transaction!
B009VSW15Y|3.0|The camera takes Good Pictures Of your self  The camera is on the wrong side  I can not tell when I take a picture of something else
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I guess the best ending you could hope for<br />I don't regret the time I've spent reading Hunger Games even though I had expected different endings. Closure.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not put this book down. Everything ties together perfectly. I loved it so much! I highly recommend it!
0307455874|3.0|This book is well written and gives you a peek into who Barack Obama is and how he was shaped.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|it is sometimes a real brainteaser gets addicting. watch where the flow winds up but can't cross the lines interesting
B002N1AEN2|5.0|it has been too long since i bought a cd that i liked more than two songs, i bought for &#34;intro&#34; but like several of the other songs
0823015033|5.0|My daughter loves working with polymer clay and this book was very useful in developing her skills with making different characters.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put it down!  Read it in a day.  Can't wait to read the others in the series.  Great read for adults as well as teenagers.
1451695195|5.0|I enjoyed the presentation of the info in the book. It is an easy read. I recently lost my Dad and this book was helpful.
0547848412|5.0|Lots of details on religion, survival and animal behavior. Sometimes, it might seem a bit too slow, but overall the book is a winner. Definitely recommend this book.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a fun city building game.  It is similar to the original Virtual City game but with the limited energy of other facebook games.
B003L77TZI|1.0|I can't believe this album had 7 #1 hits. The teens must be messing with the ratings system. This album is no where close to Michael Jackson or Stevie Wonder. I gave it away.
B004SIP9RO|5.0|This was a present to my older daughter and she loved the movie. It has a great story line and great ending.
B001P06GX4|4.0|I bought this for my husband and I to play because of good reviews. I would like to point out that the little one square is not a single unit (that's what I envisioned for some reason). These game pieces come in different tetris-like shapes. It was still a lot of fun, though. We each played two colors (like directions advised for two players). We had a good time playing and will be playing again.
B005HSL626|5.0|I'm not really a gamer,but I can't stop playing this. I played it everyday of my vacation. love beating my high score.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|loved the twists and turns. one of  my favorite reads of 2012.  seemed to be the book that everyone talked about
B00AMBH70S|5.0|It was exciting and fast paced. We really enjoyed it and would recommend it to others. I loved the change of leading men...it worked
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This is a fun app where you can design your restaurant. You must be careful though especially if your children use this app. Disable in app purchase and set up a purchase pin so that you or your child avoid accidentally buying gems with real cash.
0452295548|5.0|I heard about this book from my brother who is a stroke victim. He was working his way through it and his wife told me that he was &#34;very interested in what he was reading&#34;. I bought the book and read it in about two days. I was fascinated by the author's description of the 'event' of her own stroke and how she was able to describe the progression of it. She offered lists for those dealing with stroke victims (in the appendix) which I would recommend to read earlier on.<br />  I have another friend who is a stroke victim and receives wonderful care but I learned that the way I was dealing with her is probably wrong. I believe now that she really does understand what is being said to her even though she cannot always make sense in her verbal response. (My brother calls people he knows by many different names.)<br />  Overall I found the book a wonderful encouragement for me and hopefully for those who work with stroke patients. I gave it as a gift to the nurses where my friend is cared for. I recommend it highly for anyone interested in a first hand experience of a life changing event. The courage and determination shown by the author are commendable.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|We've all heard the phrase \\"what happens in Vegas...\\", and we've all read or watched the story of the couple who are drunk and stupid who get married while in Vegas, so I was a little leery.  But, when wanting the spend a day with a cute/fun story this Christmas holiday, I was not at all disappointed and even quite surprised at how realistic the author made the story. I adored the opening scene (head in the toilet) and him not so impressed with his new wife's appearance.  What really made me fall in love with the story though was finding out the marriage wasn't consummated on the wedding night.  I was hooked!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love spider. I used to play on the desk top all the time. I enjoy a game that I know you can't always win.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|good reading. keeped my attention thru the whole book. looking forward to reading more Jack Reacher books, and seeing the movie.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|My son rents a room and needed a small vacuum. We already have one at home, so decided to get him one. It is perfect for his small space.
0525478817|4.0|I love John Green and his novels, and this one did not let me down. It had wonderful characters, engaging plot and beautiful writing style. This book will make you laugh, cry and feel.
034580404X|5.0|this was the best set of books ever!! E L JAMES is such a great story teller.  MORE BOOKS PLEASE
B000HEWEJO|4.0|Good memories and good for teach the family some values and a good movie and it is not to expensive but probably they can lower the price
B00A757EFW|4.0|This game brings back memories of sitting at an old pac-man game feeding it my quarters. I had a little trouble with the lite at first .
B008M87GJK|5.0|This is my go-to app for news, along with Newshog.  Interface is easy to use, lets you quickly see main headlines.  You can easily set up which news categories to list.<br /><br />One issue is that some news stories stay on the app for days.  You get tired of seeing the same stories day after day.  I find it hard to believe that there is no new news in those categories.  But this occurs in less active &#34;evaluation and analysis&#34; and &#34;other items&#34; type news categories.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I like it, but on Survival when I try and harvest cobblestone it wont let me collect it! Please fix!&quot;
B007THA4FI|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book even though I had not read any of her Harry Potter books.  I read someone's comment who said it was difficult in the beginning to keep the characters straight, and that was true enough.  However, I was soon able to sort through them all and became interested in seeing how the story turned out.<br /><br />This novel contains a cross-section of society, how the various peoples interact or don't, and probably shows how little people really know about one another even though judgements are being made constantly about what these people think they know.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Lots of puzzles. No lag. And cheaply priced. All the things I look for in a game. Or an app. And easy to learn!
B008ASLK8A|4.0|Another great Holmes movie with two of my favorite actors.  They clicked and their dialogues were intriquing. Super action scenes as well.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|To easy at first but once you get to the higher levels you have to use that brain a little. My grandson didn't want to quit once he got started.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|This is a great app to access and store your favorite web-streaming radio stations. Easy to use UI, good sound quality, though that depends also on the station streaming the audio.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Enjoyed this film.  I could see my parents' in these characters, and a little bit of myself too.  I'd recommend this to others!
0547884591|5.0|I have been a follower of Tim Ferriss and have read his past books. \\"Four Hour Body\\" led be to lose 35 lbs in 60 days, \\"Four Hour Work Week\\" led me to simplify my life. \\"Four Hour Chef\\" has led me to learn how to crack eggs correctly, make the best scrambled eggs ever, learn the outline of new languages and if I ever need to do so, kill and skin a deer. I think Tim has ADHD, I do too and you see it clearly in his writings. In 10 pages you can go from a great dinner recipe to swimming, ballroom dancing and then how to write in chinese. Overall, it is a book on \\"living the good life\\". If you think randomly quite often, like I do, you will love this book. It's a staple in our kitchen and will be for years to come!
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|excellent game keeps me on my toes...I like the competion a must have app my kid's are always stealing my tablet
B00574P964|5.0|My whole family thought this was a very funny and entertaining movie. It's definitely a kinds film produced for ages 10 and up because my kids actually sit down to watch it this time.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Felt like I was on an emotional roller coaster...in a good way.  I laughed, cried, felt the anger, enjoyed the love story.  The book gave you a little of everything. I tell all my friends to read it.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Lists the WiFi signals and relative strenghts that your kindle can pick up. Handy for determining WiFi hot or cold-spots when setting up WiFi for home or office use.  Also helps you select less-used channels in congested signal areas. Simple, intuitive user interface and selection of signal measurement displays.
B00005AR3G|5.0|Such an incredible movie that is hard to find in stores. Item came on time for Christmas and surprised my best friend with her favorite movie! Item was better than described and on time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Ok, so i loved the movie and though the book could not possibly be any better! Boy was i wrong!!!<br /><br />Te book gives so much more detail into the story! The character have so much more depth! Like<br />Peeta for example, in the movie they depict him as just a weak kid who's cute but he's so much<br />more than that! Smart and kind!<br />I recommend this book to anyone, once i started reading it i was not able to put it down...<br />I also think it leaves the reader with a healthy dose of questions, things that i hope will be answered<br />in the following books.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|i didn't read it i just went through the book but i bet it was a good book i want to read it but i don't have enough time
B00846REIS|4.0|I read this book because I had just finished the 50 shades of Grey series and was looking for a new romance to get indulged in. This book did it for me. If u liked 50, u will love this book! Can't wait to read the second one!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really really love this game even more.  the picture is bigger to see and larger for my fingers.  it is even better than the other bingo.
B0016K40KY|5.0|This recording has the best video quality available outside of a Blueray version (which was only released recently, and is still expensive). I never tire of watching this movie; the acting, cinematography, and quality of the image are always amazing to watch.
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|I love this series. Has a different twist on vampires that makes the base of the story unique. Wicked sense of humour.
B004WR125O|4.0|Amazon suggests this unit as a purchase with purchase for the Onkyo TX-NR414 receiver.  I trusted the suggestion and didn't read the description very closely.  This unit is compatible with TX-NRxx9 receivers.  Don't trust the Amazon suggestions implicitly.  Read the description carefully and make sure this is compatible with your receiver before you order it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|So glad I am able to watch this season of the Walking Dead. I don't have cable, so this is the perfect solution.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent.<br />The one click to purchase button shouldn't be so close...I accidentally clicked and got charged and had to fight for reimbursement.
B0057LUI0O|5.0|My 4yo daughter loves this movie!! She is not a fan of the usual animated line up of movies. So this one is a true winner for us. I love the fact that I now own it and she can watch it at anytime!
0545405777|5.0|All Hunger Games books were a great read.  I've never seen the movie, but books are always better than the movie.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is a a really great item to get if you love action. Its great for kids to watch and who doesn't love batman. It would keep you entertained if you were to have an all movie weekender with the family
B000PAAJYW|5.0|I love P. T. Anderson's work but this might be my favorite film of his. The way he weaves and compares lives on the brink is the work of a master filmmaker.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne is amazing at describing how it feels like she is in the Hunger Games! She is truly an amazing author. The way she puts the wording is AMAZING. It feels like you are in the Hunger Games and feels so real.
0525952926|5.0|Ken Follett never ceases to disappoint me with his books.  I've read Pillars of the Earth, World Without End, Fall of Giants and now Winter of the World.  In every one I was sorry to see it end.  He has a wonderful knack for interweaving all of the families and writing historical events that can be understood.  I'm anxiously waiting for Book Three of the trilogy to come out.  Thanks Mr. Follett for continuing to greatly entertain me.
B0098TGV20|3.0|Got my box in today and I did fault Amazon for the less than secure packaging and shipping of the box. There were outer dings to the box and the corner was split. However I can't fault them for the inside of the box. All but a handful of the albums are bent and wrinkled...Personally I think the box is too small for the albums. There's going to be some wear on the covers going in and out of the box because they are a little too \\"snug\\". Paying what I've paid I've asked for a replacement and Amazon is shipping me one. I hope it's in better shape than this one. Otherwise, it's a great concept - all of The Who's studio albums. Again, I just hope the replacement is in a lot better shape.
0439023513|5.0|All Hunger Games books were really good.  Too bad there were only three in the series.  Could have kept reading.
B0057LUI0O|5.0|Super cute and funny. Appropriate for all ages. This is my girlfriends favorite movie. Im 22 and male for reference.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Easy read and great story! The movie did a good job but, lets face it, the books are usually better.  These did not disappoint!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|It was a great story about world war II combat, which I have a keen interest in.<br /> The author did a good job of telling the stories of both pilots and their backgrounds.  He had done a lot of research for the book and it really showed in the finished product.
0307596885|2.0|After reading the reviews on this book, I was anxious to read it.  Several stories later, I realized it was not what I expected and very cumbersome reading.  I did stick with it, though, hoping with each story it would improve.  It didn't and I wouldn't recommend it at all.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Fun game for wasting time. cute little jello puzzle game good animation good choice for download for me and my 3 yr old
0439023491|5.0|Really liked all the Hunger Games Books.  They made you want to keep reading till you finished them all.  Great Books.
B0020PJJHS|4.0|Not the best feedback I've ever seen, but decent. Love the movie though, classic. Wish it was free with prime though...
B001NLKT60|5.0|This was an excellent follow-up to the girl with the Dragon tattoo. I love Lisbeth Salander and this series. I can't wait to read the conclusion of this series.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|A beautifully written story, with a brilliant yet torturous end.There was nothing about this story I didn't like. Well done.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This is one of my wife's favorites!  Great sound and the picture is amazing.  If you like this film blu-ray is the way to go!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was incredible!  Loved it from the start.  I only caution you not to read as a book to fall asleep reading.  I stayed up way past my bedtime many nights because of this book.  Heart wrenching story with amazing characters.  Can not believe life used to be like this book.
141659521X|5.0|Love the Mitch Rapp series.  Keeps you on your toes all the time.  We have read them all.  Keep them coming!!
0756697875|4.0|A great purchase for kids. Cool little figure and lots a great pictures and information. Wonderful for kids to read through on a car ride.
0375869026|5.0|This book is better than Harry Potter ,because it teaches you  that you should be friends with someone that does not have any friends.And I really recommend this book!!!!!!!<br />PS: I am 8 and a 1/2 years old and I am submitting this with my mom's help.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such a great and easy read. Could not put it down and for good reason. Very excited to read books two and three!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Really enjoyed this one. It is a quick starter and keeps going at speed and keeps you flipping pages and not wanting to put the book down. This is one of Vince's better books.
030745455X|4.0|The books can be too graphic at times, but Steig Larsson's Harry Hole character is a complex but driven individual whose pursuit of justice is very intriguing.  There are always other interesting characters in his books.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|Stupid. I really Can't believe that Mark Wahlberg or Mila Kunis agreed to even be in this movie. I only gave it a shot because Mark was in it...
B004I1AGTC|5.0|this is the best martial arts franchise out right now Donnie Yen is amazing the product was in amazing condition
B007SGM084|5.0|Great, great Trilogy! Hard to put down! Can't wait to read it again! It is a must read! Loved it!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I am a big fan of the series so this book is great to me . And I think people should recommend this book I know I am .
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thought all three of the 50 Shades books were fabulous.  It was fun to escape real life for a while and share in Anastasia and Christian's romance.  I highly recommend this book if you're not offended by sexual situations.  It's a great story.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I knew this would be nothing like we have seen before as fans of JK Rowling.  I have always considered myself a fan of Rowling rather than just a HP fan; and all the things I have come to love and expect from her writing was present; clever, complex polt, witty turns of phrase, and beautiful descriptions that are true to life.  I am no expert, but most importantly for me is that there is more to the story than merely the story... just as in Harry Potter there is much depth and symbolism that transcends the story.  I hope to see much much much more from Rowling in the future.
031603973X|4.0|I'm a fanatic for A Christmas Carol, so when I ran across it in a Pop-Up book, I was thrilled. Unfortunately, I wasn't as thrilled when I opened it. The artwork itself (illustrations) are wonderful, but the pop-ups themselves do not work as well as they should. The page with Marley and the moneyboxes was great! The Spirit of Christmas Yet To Come, not so much. The Spirit will not unfold properly, much as on the opening page, where Scrooge looks like he's trying to lie down in his doorway.<br /><br />The little booklets that tell the story sometimes fall out when the book is opened, and at least one of them takes quite a bit of effort to put back in the slot.<br /><br />Because I love the story and because I love pop-up books, I would certainly not return it, but I would have expected it to be a 5+ star book, and I cannot give it more than 4 and would only recommend it with the caveat that it may be less than you expected.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book!  I'm not sure I can put down the words to even justify how great this read was.  I fell in love with Sky and Holder from the beginning and was captivated with the story till the very end, and still I want more!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a first I've read of Mira and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a wonderful love story about a one in a lifetime found love. Much like my life.<br />: )
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a unique mystery novel. Lots of twists and turns turns that kept me guessing until the end. Very fast, easy read. I thoroughly enjoyed Gone Girl.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Case broke less then a month after I got it...I am glad it was never tested to do its job, may have broke the phone
B004V5A7K8|5.0|I enjoy playing this game.  Always a good mind teaser when you have idle hands and mind.  A keeper for sure.
0307352145|5.0|Cain has the ability of presenting academic research results in a very intriguing way. It feels more like reading a detective novel. Full of insights.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|At first, I was mesmerized by the continuation left by the cliffhanger that was the second book...until the plot centered around the war seemed to drag on forever. My interest waned, but curiosity - driven by Peeta's fate - commanded me to push through. I'm glad I didn't write it off half way through, despite the ever changing scenery as a plot twist showed up at the end of every chapter (at least it kept me guessing, and they weren't too far fetched or unbelievable).<br />Because it was the ending that put everything in perspective and gave that world purpose as well as meaning.<br />I'm impressed overall...just had to get through the slow parts that drove me insane due to impatience.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|8 dvd movies for less than 30 bucks?<br />how can ya go wrong!! my niece absolutely LOVED this Christmas gift!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|After reading Gone Girl by the same author, I expected so much more from this book. It was still a good read. Fairly standard murder/mystery.
B0058YPG1G|4.0|This is an interesting TV show, and it definitely keeps your attention.  It can be a little bit graphic with the violence so we fast forward those parts.
B007I1QUYE|5.0|This set is a great value. Not much on special features, but I'm not worried about that with these movies. All three look great and sound amazing.
1455523550|5.0|Perfect read anytime of day. Keeps my interest. Another one of Nicholas Sparks big hits! Can't wait for the movie.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I like this movie. Just your basic movie and case. Great deal for the money. Quality on DVD was just great. A few bonus items, but not many. Good for those looking for just the basic movie and that's it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Sparks is never sappy when it comes to love stories. But Safe Haven isn't like his other books it's just as heartwarming as all of his other books, but for me it touches on a very personal subject. My dad died of lung cancer about 6 months ago, and left my mom a widow. I never in my life could have imagined reading about a love like theirs, but I think if any book could describe it Safe Haven would. This book made me ball my eye  out, but it also opened my eyes to see the world around me again bustling with opportunities I thought vanished after my dad died. This book gave me hope again, and a great lesson, and understanding. I would recommend it to anybody who loves to read it's simply wonderful.
1451695195|2.0|I was disapointed in the lack of detail in Proof of Heaven descriptive and experiences while he was in Heaven. The book seem more focused on his medical problems and medical narrative of the conditon than his Proof of Heaven experiences.
0446580848|3.0|If you are looking for a long history or geography lesson, this is the book for you.  If, however, you are looking forward to a great John Corey adventure, it's not here.  This book is unbelievably boring.  I love John Corey but after 100 pages of him in The Panther, I wanted him to just shut up.  There are way too many characters in this book and they are all dull and longwinded.  The &#34;thriller&#34; I was waiting for never appeared.  The end result was so long in coming I really didn't care who expired.  If you want great John Corey, try another of DeMille's books.  This book will not make you a Corey or Mayfield (Mrs. Corey) fan.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|This collection is just the movies, and very little special features. All of the movies look tremendously better than their DVD counterparts. If you are looking for a full collection featuring everything, the newer collection is for you.
0316228532|3.0|I had trouble getting into this book but once I did I was hooked. I would recommend this to friends and family.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|At first I did not know if it would be good. But it's is one of the best books I have ever read. If you read a little you want to read more and more and more. I recommend reading this book. ; )
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great and fun game just follow the goals and you'll do fine it is a really easy game I recommend to anybody.
B000WAGVHE|5.0|This is a great movie.  If you are partial to the original John Waters film, you definitely need to check this out.  I was definitely skeptical when I first heard about this movie -- particularly a cross-dressing John Travolta.  But it is really, really cute...heartwarming...and Nikki Blonsky (a/k/a Tracy Turnblad) just makes this piece glow with happiness and love.  Finally available in BluRay, this 2-disc \\"Shake & Shimmy\\" addition contains hours of bonus features and does even more justice to this future film classic.
B000SX9NAC|5.0|Great music, it is a listen to every track album. Wish I hadn't missed the chance at a live show.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I love this movie, and I have been waiting for its Blu-ray since Blu-ray debuted back in 2006. This was well worth the wait. The movie looks and sounds stunning. All of the special features are wonderful. The documentaries shine a lot of light on what James Cameron's intentions were. The deleted scenes also fill a lot of holes in the movie. Perfect Blu-ray.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This movie was funnier than I thought it would be.  Would definitely watch again, especially because I like Mark Wahlburg.
B008N1V11U|5.0|this needs to be made for the Wwii and other games the game was great.  my father would love it I give. it a 8
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book can't wait to read the next one.. the best book I have read in a long time
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Entitled playing lots if ho scenes pretty good puzzles. Good graphics. Only issues I had were difficulties picking up a few ho items (boomerang gave me big problem but I got it eventually)
B005J0VPNC|3.0|Not bad it you want to take photos with a filter. Most people would prefer to take a normal photo and then apply a filter after the fact.
B004U52VPS|5.0|This game is easy to play and very fun for all the Angry Birds enthusiasts out there. You get to build the set yourself and launch the birds at it in real life. Very fun.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I did not understand what all the fuss was about until I tried it myself.  I discovered that Pinterest is amazing and is a great place to save ideas, instructions, and how-to's you find on the internet so you can have them for later reference.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I have struggled with my weight loss battle for years.  This book has given me hope that I can overcome my addiction by divorcing wheat.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|It was quite interesting but<br /><br />rather dull overall it was quite fascinating<br /> I would give it 4 stars and I learned something new
1606995359|5.0|Great art and great writing.  I look forward to collecting this entire set from Fantagraphics over the coming years.  Highly recommended.
1419705849|4.0|My son has been wanting this series of the Wimpy Kid adn was so excited when it came in the mail!! He just needs to learn how to read!!
B00634GHJA|5.0|I gotten this app awhile ago but use it today for the first to transfer pictures from my old phone that I pass on to my grandson. I transfer about 63 pictures in less than 20 mins. Very easy to operate
B009RI4ZKC|3.0|With limited options, I decided to give Monrise Kingdom a shot. It turned out to be an a, cool, quirky, enjoyable film. Worth renting.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book kept me wanting more! It was a great end to a series. The best of the series !
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|This is a awesome book... I recommend the first Diary of a Wimpy Kid 1 to people that are new to the series even though all of the books are good..and I was able to finish this book in less than a hour or two :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Unpredictable and intrigueing!  It kept me curious for what would happen next and trying to connect the clues.  Loved it!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I decided to read this book after it had been out for several months andmany friends asked if I had read it yet! It was a fast paced and captivating story-I was not able to put it down and read it in about a week!
B0085YNML2|3.0|Standard &#34;collect the 3 stars&#34; type game. It's cute, but it's not exactly the most responsive game ever made. It may charm children or lizard lovers.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Amaizing efects good drama. I recommend it to all people wants to watch a horror movie with excellent efects and some jokes.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really hope the love between Christian and Ana lasts... great<br />Part 2 of the trilogy ... can't wait for #3
B007R6UWN0|5.0|Jason Isaacs is captivating as Jackson Brody in this TV adaption of Kate Atkinson's novel. The teleplay is closely linked to the book, which is a great read, but it also takes advantage of the visual medium's ability to intertwine stories using flashbacks. Well worth the money!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I always look forward to the latest Scaroetta novel.  This was good but not one of my favorites.  The characters were not likable and it seemed just a little too scrambled
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This story s a rollercoaster ride. Once you think you figured it out, she turns on you. I love the ending.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game; I've completed all free levels. Some levels are super easy and obvious, and other are mind-boggling. It definitely feels like an accomplishment when you finish one of those levels! The game design is simple and plain, but it focuses on the puzzles themselves, without distracting you with fancy buttons and whatnot. Defintely a good time-waster.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|Very funny and heart-warming movie! We enjoy watching it every year as a family at Christmas time. Watch it if you haven't seen it!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|LOVED IT.  Read it through in one evening as it was impossible to sleep until I finished this book.  Definitely worth losing sleep to finish it.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I purchased my AKG 240 headphones over two decades ago... and have owned a dozen or more name brand, upscale headphones since. I have a new pair of Quiet Comfort Bose and although they are clean sounding, nothing beats the overall quality of sound and comfort of wearing my good old AKG 240s.I have never even had to replace a part on them. I wish AKG make cars and such, as they would no doubt be a high quality upgrades on what I own now.
B00000J048|5.0|Great product, my 2.5 year old son loves playing with it, and I enjoy it myself, to be honest :) We create very cool designs together, and he can also do it on his own. Recommend it to anyone whose child likes to build and explore things.
B008ELUEQC|2.0|I didn't really care for this CD at all and plan to give it to someone that would appreciate it.<br /><br />It came in the time it was to get here but really not a good CD.
B004HX4RT6|4.0|Apparently I stink at Chess because I keep losing, even on easy! However, the design and interface are nice and well done. It looked clean and orderly, something that any chess game needs.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book kept my attention and wanting to read more.  Writing style is well paced and explicit.  If you enjoy the first book you will definitely want to read the other two.
B00ARAO720|4.0|Great DVD/Movie! Well worth the small cost of renting it for the evening<br /><br />Exciting and full of twists and turns ( litterally) Joseph Gordon Levitt is superb.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Starts a bit slower than most of his other books, but the interes, but it gets much better after that - and the ending is a real surprise that I had not even  considered as a possibility.
B000Q99EAC|5.0|I really did not expect a whole lot from this film, and it turned out to be a great surprise.  The story line was a perfect ending to one of the great stories.  People will always remember Rocky!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This is definitely Susan Boyle's best CD to date.  I am so glad I had it to share around the holidays.  I plan to buy more for gifts this year.<br /><br />Her voice is like no other and it gives you goosebumps.<br /><br />Thank you Susan for being you.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I didn't think I'd become so infatuated with this game, but I am! It's simple, and the Egyptian Theme is kind of unnecessary, but the graphics are nice and it's responsive to touch. Submitting a high score sometimes messes up on arcade mode, but other than that, no real issues with this game.
0061438294|5.0|I am enjoying reading this book, hopefully to help me to have a better understanding of people body languages. and I hope to use this with my career as a PI and mental health therapist
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|What is not to love, simple and effective.  Works like a charm, was just what I needed.  Great little app.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|I love Jo Nesbo's writing.  I had the killer figured out pretty much from the start, just couldn't figure out how it would be told.  Nesbo (or Harry) reveals this is the way it works in solving crimes in The Redeemer, so if you look at the plot closely, the reader can begin to understand how Harry's mind works - and this is the real enjoyment of the stories for me.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Great movie - both leads are fantastic actors!  Everything movie Tommy Lee Jones does is excellent and you can't find a better actress than Meryl Streep
B003O86FMW|4.0|I had to sit through the first book and grit my teeth in the simplicity of each character and the plot itself. After much persuasion and may denying remarks I chose to read the distal version of book two. The multitude of plots and sub-plot was a vast improvement. For the first time I could see the attachment to certain characters and no longer feeling as if there is a requirement to enjoy the main character. Each district having its down falls and leaving a mist of doubt of what could possibly happen next was a much better experience. Out of five I would give it a three and a half but that is impossible on a digital review. Now I am not questioning reading the third.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Simple andfun to play.  The only drawback is when ellowing the program to &quot;auto complete&quot;, you can't shorten the animation sequence.  Other than that... thisis a great program.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This movie like the rest of the Dark Knight Trilogy is a cut above the superhero genre. This one is my favorite of the three.
0375869026|5.0|My 5th grader got this for her birthday, devoured it and then told me I really needed to read it.  Loved it.  It is not a high-adventure, or comedy story (although it is gently humorous and has a solid storyline), but is mainly a school and coming-of-age character story.  The style is different in that each major character gets a moment in the spotlight so the readers gets a wide-range of experiences and feelings that deal with the events.  I think this book is very insightful, and is a great way for kids to safely play out a situation where someone is physically or mentally different and actually think about how they might react and how it would make the other person feel.  This is a book I'm glad to own.
B00001PE4D|4.0|Cruel Intentions is a dark comedy with the sex ramped up to suffocating levels. As a movie, you can't take it too seriously, otherwise you'll hate it. The plot doesn't make sense, the characters are far too melodramatic, and there's more sexual tension on screen than in most pornos. As an actor, Ryan Philippe as Sebastian just can't hold his own when across from either Reese Witherspoon or Sarah Michelle Gellar, both of whom bring more gravity to the movie than it deserves.<br /><br />Yet, flaws aside, Cruel Intentions is funny. There's enough absurdity to make it a fun, if disturbing watch. If you watch the movie with a sense of detachment, you'll be able to appreciate the humor. If you try to make sense of the plot or characters, you'll fail. Part of what makes it so fun to watch is Gellar's sexy, over-the-top performance. I think what I like best of all is how it takes so many romantic comedy cliches and completely turns them on their head. No happy endings here!<br /><br />Recommended - with caution.
B005KELQEU|5.0|It was very well insulated and of good quality. Everyone I showed it to thought it was a great deal
B00008NG5V|5.0|My doctor has his CD playing at the office and I love his voice.  I love this CD and the In Between Dreams CD.  Very relaxing and mellow.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I keep my brain going  when I am bored ,help me with concetration .<br />Keep your stepping ahead mind going.
1439153663|4.0|This book had great flow. I chose the unabridged audiobook version so I could listen at the office. I found myself entranced in the words and dying to know what was coming. I began listening on my commute, at work, and even in the bathtub at night. Great read!!!
B00006LLLN|4.0|I've always loved Alison Krauss and her band. She also has been featured on Country Music shows. Good, old-fashioned music and entertaining. Good band backups, as well. Barbara Fifield
0451232852|4.0|The only thing keeping this book from a 5 star rating by me is about 300 pages. For me it was about 300 pages too long. Far too many pages where we were separated by the core characters with long meanderings about war and/or politics. I know many historical fiction readers probably loved this, but it lost my interest often. Only when we would get back to the families did I become engaged again. Will certainly read book 2 but may need a breather in between.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|When I started playing it I got to the part where you put all the mask on the gate the went black and I kept tapping play but it did not go back to what I was doing but it went to the part where you want to pay for the mini games but kept tapping later and again and again I guess I have to delete it
B008QMMEOE|4.0|My son has a blast with this game, but we only have the free version and I need to figure out how to upgrade to the paid version to unlock the other screens.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|I like the app and the videos!  Nice to find some old videos and newer songs.  Keep it playing free.
B002NZV68U|5.0|Versatlity! They name is Depp!<br /><br />Is there any outcast, weirdo, fish out of water that Johnny Depp cannot play! He turns conventionality on his ear when he dons the familiar Willy Wanka outfit and makes us laugh and think in the process.<br /><br />He's just so unpredictable! What will he do next?! I wouldn't bet on it! If you see what I'm saying. Depp can touch us in any roll he does and he's not above tryign somethign different like being someone who's different from the rest of us but also the same on the inside.<br /><br />And I think that's how we should look at his career -- as a man who took us on a long jaunt of heavy makeup and wardrobe just to show us all that we're all humans on the inside. Except for TOm Cruise.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|What a great movie, I enjoyed the constant changes between different levels of dreams that happen seamlessly ,  my wife wasn't to thrilled since she got confused many times and I had to pause the movie to explain to her.<br /><br />Only thing that I would have like to see was a real finale to it not the &#34;doubt&#34; that we were left with.
B007V65R54|5.0|Other reviewers have correctly pointed out the meat of Chapter 8 on Bayesian inference, but actually that chapter is pretty bare-boned that you want to &#34;improve&#34; with an additional example or two.  But the real advantage of this book is it's readability, and you do that by talking about the math, not doing much of it, and keeping computations minimal and superficial.  What are the results, what do they mean, and what is their utility.  I was most impressed with his applications and examples, mostly one per chapter.  If you want to better understand any of these current topics, I recommend you read that chapter.  As the chapter titles don't always help that much with their content, these are the major topics in each:<br /><br />Chapter 01: Historical perspectives<br />Chapter 02: 2008 Financial Crisis<br />Chapter 03: Baseball (Moneyball & Sabermetrics)<br />Chapter 04: Weather Forecasts<br />Chapter 05: Earthquake Prediction<br />Chapter 06: Polls (Psephology)<br />Chapter 07: Epidemics<br />Chapter 08: Bayesian Thinking<br />Chapter 09: Machine Envy<br />Chapter 10: Poker (Texas Hold-Em)<br />Chapter 11: Stock Market<br />Chapter 12: Global Warming<br />Chapter 13: Terrorism<br /><br />My &#34;better-understanding&#34; standouts were chapter 2, 4, 5, 7, and especially chapter 12.  Would have liked more detail about his polling techniques in chapter 6 (live in Indiana -- his one error in the 2008 presidential election prediction).
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Very funny! I enjoyed it so much I read it 24/7 I got it yesterday and I finished it today! Can't wait for the next one!
B0061S073A|1.0|Waste of time and computer space. Makes everything freeze and slow down. Has to go. Not happy with it at all.
1616614609|5.0|I already owned this product so this was a second set. The price was unbeatable and it arrived three days earlier than I expected. Now I will just wait for the Star Wars to go on sale. :)
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|So short... A few levels and then the credits start rolling... i dont get it... It looked like there were so many other levels...
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I heard this was really funny from friends.I thought it was just okay. I might recommend this to someone who is easily amused.
B005EPFA8I|4.0|This film has what it takes to engage both sides of the brain, five stars worth.  The narrator (sonorous) and the soundtrack (screechy), however, became monotonous over the course of the film.  Recommended overall -- certainly would be even better in the original 3D!
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Just an incredible performance by a full cast!!  Amazing sound and picture quality.  This is a disc I wanted for my permanent collection.
1451638450|4.0|Ivan proves he's not quite the idiot that his relatives and associates seem to think he is. A very good addition to the Vorkosigan series that seems to be set between Diplomatic Immunity and Cryoburn. I recommend this as a worthy addition, but should not be read as the introductory novel to the series.
B00760BPOC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the characters and families as the story unfolded and could not wait to get started on the next book.
B0064W67IM|5.0|Neil Gaiman is a terrific author and story teller. This novel explores many genes of writing, within one fantastic context. Layered and rich, with superb artwork to go along with a unique and fun story. Great book.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|i really like this book . Very interesting. I would recommend this book If you like Charles Dickens . This is a good read.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This was a great movie!....So few times can we walk away from a movie and be thankful that this was a real life event. Renews your faith in people. This was uplifting and heart warming...something seldom seen anymore..especially from hollywood. This was a great film and will have you walking away feeling empowered and joyous!
B002WJI658|5.0|Very soft, seems very well made, a good buy. I am very pleased with the item matching the pictures and descriptions.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|It's an okay movie if you like a lot of gun fire, stuff blowing up, and blood and guts. Not nearly as good as the first movie.<br />Reminds me of all of the war games they have out. The next movie will at least have a plot and some dialogue.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Great film. Who doesn't love The Lion King??? I got this for my niece, and I know she's going to love it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is a very gd game and my kids luv it! Very addictive and lots of fun!! hope u have fun as well
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book big fan of Diary Of A Wimpy Kid. :-) You go Jeff Kinney. Make more books please.
B004OKFISQ|5.0|Our 21 year old daughter LOVED it.  Timeless music! Brought tears to her eyes, she was so excited to get this
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The whole book was infinite... I feel like I'm Charlie's best friend.<br />He really is special.<br />I will read it again.
0062215507|5.0|I saw one commenter mention that it wasn't a great guide for film-makers, and that is true. It doesn't give a ton of detail on each thing, but if you want it just because you like Harry Potter, then it is perfect. It provides sketches of scenes and costumes, photos, cast and crew interviews, etc. It's similar to stuff that you might find on a bonus DVD, but in paper form. (it's got a lot of extra's tucked into it, like stickers and photo books. It's not all on the pages.)<br /><br />Is it an in-depth look at the film that focuses on details of every aspect? No, not at all. It's made for kids to be able to enjoy and learn from. If you want to study the film, you'll have to look elsewhere (although it might be a decent jumping-off point.) But as just a fun glimpse into the world, it's great.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I'm addicted to doing puzzles. I like how there are a lot of free ones to do. Definitely recommend this app!
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|It didn't work - period.  I loaded it, unloaded it, and reloaded it but it never worked at all.  My kids were very disappointed.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I can't figure out how to play it.  No instructions anywhere.  Page is littered with &#34;stuff&#34; with no instructions that I can find.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|love it what more can I say.  love it what more can I say. love it what more can i
B006WWTKQ0|5.0|This is a great 3D movie for kids, the 3D effects are really good I would recommend this movie for kids
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|G5 has given us another great game. mini-games just the right difficultly. Miles the monkey a clever new feature. hope there are more games on the way.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This move had me literally roflmao! I'm going to buy the DVD so that I can see the extras, like the behind the scenes and blooper reels. Seth Macfarlane is a comical genius!
B0092QITO2|1.0|Colin Farrel is one of the worst actors in the history of cinema. Every thing this guy is involved with is usually a flop. BORING. BORING. BORING. A TOTAL FLOP!
B000P0J0EW|4.0|This 1994 film depicts an aspect of prison life that circumvents the lives of two prisoners played by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. One man is not guilty of the crime for which he has been sentenced. So, the hardships suffered over the twenty or so years he is imprisoned, justify the final act; called redemption.<br /><br />Worthwhile!
B009MO5G90|5.0|I 'm a big fan of all resident evil moviesand I owns several of them, I would for sure recommend this movie
0425263908|1.0|This book is dysfunctional and so vulgar I couldn't finish reading it!  It's a story about 2 highly dysfunctional people trying to make a very dysfunctional relationship work just over sex.  I would recommend not wasting time on this book.
1439156816|5.0|I bought this as a gift and the person I bought it for could not stop raving about it. She has said that I have to read it if it's the only book I read this year.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Pictures show well what this case can do, and it does as shown and advertized.<br />Priced wisely. I would recommend this to one who is looking for protective case as it's back side  is as solid as should be. I am not fan of leather in electronics so fits me well.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Beautiful story that solidifies the belief that true love know as NO limits and will conquer all. One of his best works. Look forward to seeing it in the big screen
0425263916|2.0|As a rape victim, I find the ease with which abuse is dealt with (or rather not dealt with) is disgusting. I will never be dominated by a man, especially with sex. I can't understand how Eva is so okay with the lack of equality in a relationship & how there aren't more readers objecting to such plot lines.<br /><br />The writing is more polished than 50 shades, but I'd much rather read a poorly written piece about a consensual & mostly equal relationship that evolves positively than trash that says it is okay for a man to treat a woman like crap all in the name of control.<br /><br />The first book was more entertaining than this one, & had better sex scenes.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Just an amazing book I couldn't put  it down. Gave me hope for my silver lining. A must read book
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not put this book down - probably the fastest I've ever read a book. The drama was crazy. A bit overwhelming at times, but that's what made it so great! It was an emotional read for me. This is a book I have already shared with my friends!
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Just what my daughter wanted. I have never seen this show. I understand it is very good and it was what she wanted

B00A23MVHA|2.0|I only ordered this movie because I had a amazon gift card and wanted to see how movies look on my Kindle.This movie was a big dissapointment .Very crude in some parts.I would not let my Children watch this.The special effects were great ,too bad story line was awful.I would recommend buying this movie like I did.Rent it..
B00936A0ZW|3.0|I am a huge Paul Gilbert fan. The man is certainly one of the best guitar players extant. This CD is pleasing but I just can't call it great.
0525953728|5.0|This book was purchased for my father, an avid reader. He has told me the book is well-made with sturdy paper, an easy to read font, with the book jacket having no flaws. He is well-pleased.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|George R R Martin is a GENIUS!! Can't wait to keep reading the saga...exceptional reading material and keeps a great pace.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed the book. It's a different read for my conservative nature. It kept me captivated the whole time. Excellent read. Characters are well written with a intriguing story line.
B0049J0DC8|4.0|Really good.<br />Not my choice but my grandson chose it, he likes woody and the fact that he is a cowboy and can talk. He doesn't really understand that and is very curious about it.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Laugh out loud funny. The actors are all very good, and the music is absolutely terrific.<br />Who knew acapella could be so much fun?
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Disappointed how some foster care for our children is so damaging, that it affects them for the rest of their life.  Loved,that the main character had such a connection with flowers.  You never know what will help you through life.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|i just became a fan this season but now have seen all three seasons. I will definitely come back for more.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A MUST READ!! I could not put this book down it had me from start to finish.<br />An excellent choice for your next book club read.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|My grandson chose this because he loved the floating balloons and the fact that the horse could talk and the iguana (not sure if that is what it was) could change colors. He loved everything about this movie bright colors and all!
B003QSLDTA|5.0|One of few good Lindsay Lohan movies! Was a cute movie. Different then the original. Worth checking out if you haven't seen it yet!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I really like this app.<br /><br />Best features:<br />-the variety of songs to wake up to (much more pleasant than a typical alarm)<br />-alarm volume crescendo (doesn't scare you awake so you wake up in a good mood)<br />-being able to use your own songs (always a great feature)<br />-specials options to avoid repeated snoozing (this is a lifesaver!)<br /><br />Another plus that this has over my phone alarm is that it doesn't automatically auto-dismiss or auto-snooze, so if it's an important alarm you won't sleep through it. All in all, a very thorough, very great app. And it's free too!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book captivated me from the beginning! It truly truly shows how you can find love in the least expected place and moment in life. Would highly recommend!
B00633W614|5.0|I can't wait for the next book to come out in these chronicles. Jeffrey Archer keeps you wanting more and with a great story too. Too bad the books keep going up in price with each one. that is my only complaint. You want to read the next one and each book is a little more money--too bad that has to happen. :(
B0049J0CTM|5.0|We loved Finding Nemo we always try to watch it given a chance.<br />I ordered it because it is one of my grdandson's favorite movies!
B0063IH60K|5.0|love it! I can play anytime anywhere alone or against others! cards are easy to read and play well<br />couldn't ask for more.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Even better than the first! It's quite shocking that there is no more district twelve. I can't wait to start reading the next one!
B008M721MS|1.0|Tried to create an account but couldn't because it kept saying invalid password.  It said password had to from 6-20 characters and at least one number and one letter which my password was two numbers and six letters I don't have time for this.  App will be deleted.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Amazing! Every single song is a good one. I can't stop listening! I have been a Mumford & Sons for years and I am so glad they are finally getting the recognition they deserve!
B003K5ZQGU|5.0|This is a great movie. Easy to understand, part of history.  Share with family  & friends to learn about love, passion and power..
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Described above.  In addition to historical facts spot on descriptions on working and social conditions<br />In major countries that were impacted by WWI
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game! it is easy to access and play. do not have to wait long to complete goals.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Another game that is fun to do. It is good for the hand, eye coordination. I challenge myself on the time it takes me to complete it just to see if I can beat my fastest time. Just trying to keep my brain up to speed...
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this is a fun game. great way to pass time and take out your frustrations. the grandkids especially love this game even my three year old twin grandsons
B007C7UZIG|5.0|I like Steam solely because it downloads, installs and sets up your games automatically. You also never have to worry about scratched discs or just storing game cases ever again. The only draw back is the DRM of the games needing to talk to Steam in order to authenticate it. But seeing as everyone is always connected to the internet anyway, (or at least I am) it isn't any big deal considering the benefits you gain. Steam allows you to purchase, store, download and install your new games. It also makes playing with your friends a sinch!
0385751532|5.0|My 11 year old daughter really enjoyed this book.  She is admittedly very mature and has read other books about the holocaust.  The manner in which the book is written, from the perspective of this 9 year old boy, intrigued by \\"Out With\\" and the goings on over the fence is tragically sweet, the friendship and innocence that is illustrated in spite of the horrific realities surrounding these boys as well as the others, will linger in your mind forever.
B0093F3Q4K|5.0|Love this blu ray, it comes with a cd too.<br /><br />The concert is in stereo and 5.1 dolby surroud and sounds brilliant!
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I liked that there are many different types of forms of words in this book and not just the average dictionary but more.
B005KELW26|5.0|Love it. good color and keeps my kindle protected. also has a pocket to keep a lens cleaner cloth. easy to take places
1400052181|5.0|I am not a big reader but this book has captured my attention.  It is a true story that reads like a novel.  If you enjoy people & medical topics check this out.
B009HSVHV2|5.0|I am a lifelong KISS fan and was not dissapointed with this album.  They stay true to their sound and provide great music, as usual!  I love to listen to &#34;Hell or Hallelujah&#34; when I work out.  Great Album!
B009ZE27US|2.0|Dumb. It doesn't do anything. I thought it would be fun. Maybe it would use some math trick, but all it does is throw out a number. It's not even funny.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|I am Joe's dropped jaw.<br />Brilliant on every level. I loved every minute of this book.<br />This would make a great movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought that this was a great book and i would have everyone read it there is great writing and even if you have seen the movie read the book also
B00001QEE8|5.0|We loved this movie when we. We're little and can now watch our family enjoy it and sing along with the fun songs.
B0086700CM|1.0|Downloaded to my Kindle Fire. Doesn't always respond when I try to turn or jump so I die quickly. Disappointing...uninstalled it the same day I got it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing book that enthralled me all the way till the end. Can't wait to get a glimpse at the next one!
B001I45UFC|5.0|This is totally my type of  book. I  love the adventures and excitement. And I am definitely going to read the rest of the books!
B0042AEOG0|1.0|We bought this CD thinking it would have a similar style as Mariah's first Christmas CD. What we didn't realize is that in the late 1990s (after the release of her first Christmas CD), Ms. Carey began using what she calls a \\"whisper register\\" in her songs; basically it is a really breathy sound, and it is not at all attractive. I personally love the power behind Mariah's full voice, and I literally cringe every time she sings in her whisper register on this album. Furthermore, she switches back and forth between her full and whisper registers enough to give the listener whiplash. Also, the arrangements of the songs on this CD were not fun to listen to, and the tracks felt very cluttered. Finally, some of the tracks continue well past the point they should have ended. Over all, this CD was a huge letdown, full of breathiness, and not pleasing to the ear. Don't waste your money.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I like this version of Persuasion. I have two others and this is my favorite. It is closest to the book, although still has some deviations, but they don't detract from the story like the other two versions I own. Sally Hawkins is a little too breathless and flat, but she still does a good job.  Elizabeth is too caustic and not pretty enough. Mr Elliot, the cousin, is very well-acted. He perfectly caught the balance between being a debonair, social climber and a sly dog.  Finally, the ending kiss takes too long and is fraught with too much anxiety.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is a great alternative to my grandsons wanting to over use my android phone and running the battery down.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It is a good app the display is great and I would recommend it it gets me up on time for school
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is amazing I am 15 and there's not much I do with my 10 year old sister but every night before bed we play till she wins bring ppl colser
B00005NKK8|5.0|I loved the movie and had to have the sound track to listen to in my truck. Keep up the good work.
B001PJRAUS|3.0|I bought this dvd because I LOVE Jane Austen. It was kind of cute, but too much modernism for me 19th century tastes and ideas of Jane Austen. I didn't like all the twists of character: Wickam is a good guy, Jane gets an annulment, and finally, Elizabeth wants to stay in the 20th century. Interesting, but not a movie I want to watch over and over like a traditional Austen.
B005RUUUAI|3.0|I didn't think Season 2 was as good as Season 1. Halfway through, Season 3 seems to be back on track.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I watched the first season on another internet site and was hooked by the storyline, amazing scenery, interesting characters and even the attention to detail in all of the scenes.  So I had to watch the second season and I did within the last 48 hours.  Of course, I will be watching the 3rd season very soon.  Great entertainment for the price of a movie and a small soda!
B00003CXA2|5.0|Great movie it tell a lot about the past in a fun way. Love the movie and order the sound track to complete the package. Good work.
0767020308|5.0|Excellent movie of the great Austen novel. Kate Beckinsale really nails Emma's personality. I liked Mark Strong as Mr Knightley, although I will always like Jeremy Northam also. Mark Strong added a dimension of strength to the character of Mr Knightley that was interesting to see. All the actors were superb, the story moved through to a nice conclusion of the Harvest Dinner/announcement of Emma's engagement which isn't in the book, but seemed to fit. Very nice.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|it works for me every time I use it I would get it a gen the sounds help me out
B007IXWKUK|5.0|These books are wonderful. Such detail and very interesting I could never get enough!!! They defiantly keep you on the edge wanting more!! Thank you for your wonderful books!<br /><br />LOVE THEM!!!!
B007N5YIUS|1.0|I only saw ads that were okay - but I saw reviews that there were ads that weren't appropriate for my kids, and it is worth a couple dollars to not see inappropriate ads...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. This game is very addictive.  I play it almost whey day. If I had more time and more money I would play it a whole lot more.
B004XVMCMQ|1.0|Are you kidding me? Jane Austen??? I don't think so. This movie was terrible. The only thing that resembled Jane Austen was part of the name of the characters and some of the language and phrasing. The characters were not consistent with the intent of Austen. They made Lady Bertram a drug addict!!! Tried to tie in the slave issue in an unnatural, overt manner which is not even hinted at in this book. There was too much profanity, too much sexuality, and definitely too much brutality to slaves as depicted in supposed drawings by Tom while he visited the West Indies.<br /><br />There was no hint that audiences were about to view explicit sexually violent drawings of the slaves, and my 83 year old mother had never seen anything like it. She and I both were offended.<br /><br />I threw the movie away. I didn't want anyone else exposed to the vile, disgusting lies the movie portrayed.<br /><br />If you love Jane Austen DO NOT BUY this movie.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This, for me, is one of the greatest films I've ever seen, not to mention, the greatest and most true to Victor Hugo's vision of his masterwork of a novel.  Right off, I want to say that I loved Russell Crowes portrayal of the character, Javier.  I was hoping that for once we would get a nuanced and emotionally delivered fleshing out of this antagonist in the story.  Russell Crowe and the director, Tom Hooper, brought Javier to life, rather than ending up like in so many other portrayals, just a caricature of someone evil.  Russell Crowe's singing, as his acting, was true to the severity of the inner character of Javier's unswerving adherence to a narrow edge of living and believing, and judging without compassion.  Crowe's restrained performance truly enhanced the perception that this was a real person, ultimately confronted by his own inner rigidity.  I think that if Javier did sing, it would be exactly as controlled a singing as his limited character could allow.  Alright, enough of Russell Crowe's brilliant performance.<br />  Now for the rest of this spectacle of the human drama and of the spirit of compassion and triumph of the soul:<br />  The skill of this director in this film is exemplary.  His direction is \\"pitch-perfect\\" and elicits the most authentic of acting and singing and the enhancing employment of plot I have seen in a long time.  Even the utilizing of Javier's times of walking close to the edge of a tall wall or roof, speaks without speaking the inner tension of this character's lack of leeway or tolerance for even the slightest deviation from his narrow path of \\"law\\" and \\"order.\\"  Oops, again, I've focused upon on this much maligned performance.  I guess that I really want to offer a different interpretation and way of looking at Crowe's performance and the brilliance of Tom Hooper's direction of all the elements and actors in this film.<br />  Even the ability to simultaneously sing with deep emotion pouring forth sent shivers through me.  I saw the travelling Broadway production here in Portland, Oregon, which was perfect in technique and singing, but it lacked the spirit and soul needed to make this story more than just a soap opera melodrama.  These characters in this movie lived and breathed as real people.  I cared about them.  Yes, even Javier (oops, again)!<br />  Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway gave the performances of their lives.  Every actor and actress gave their all, the depths of their heart to their roles.  Samantha Barks  played a truly inspired performance as Eponine.  And the young boy, Gavroche, is also wonderfully played by David Huttlestone .<br />  I could go on and on about this movie.  Suffice to say in conclusion, that for me, this is a fantastic rendition of the great novel, Les Miserables, and does it justice in authenticity and the heartfelt passion of soul at the core of the human soul.  In vivid, stark and character driven realism, in my opinion, it does what no other musical on film has ever fully achieved a true to life and character portrayal of the polarity in the consciousness of humanity, between a compassionate, forgiving and richly textured view of people and life, and a rigidly controlled, one dimensional, conditional, and judgmental view.<br />  This film is, through and through, a masterpiece, I will cherish through the rest of my life.
B007TML4EI|5.0|My kids and I all enjoy this game. It involves protecting a dummy by building structures around and near it. Good review of the principles of physics.
B0070XMYWC|4.0|My five year old loves this Christmas present.  It's pink, roomy, and sturdy.  The furniture is sturdy, too --- doesn't tip over easily.  However, be ready for a challenging assembly job!  I could not have put this together on my own.
B008HK3XYK|4.0|This product is great for the money. It has the best stand up feature because you are able to stand it at any angle.  It also clips into the case compared to others which slide into a case.  I feel when they slide into a case (even though you may have more protection because the fabric wraps around the sides) you lose the feel of the Kindle.  The only drawback to the device is not being able to charge it with the case closed and the unit in the case properly.
B000Z27HLS|4.0|I liked this adaptation pretty well, The fantasy scenes where Catheriine imagines scenes from supposed novels she is reading is a little overstressed and doesn't really add to the story or characters. They could have taken those scenes out and included more of the actual story. I really enjoyed Mr. and Mrs. Allen's characters. it's a fun, though not very deep, representation of Jane Austen's novel.
B00513F9Q6|5.0|Come on, this is a really good book, even though my neighbor thinks it's about bitchy teenaged girls.  Good coming of age novel, and engaging to read.
B00A9X7X6C|4.0|When I suggested this to my wife as an option for date night, all I could really say was that just about every review I had read / heard talked about how this was much more emotionally compelling and nuanced than a run-of-the-mill sci-fi thriller. (Which I love, but would never ask her to sit through.)<br /><br />Happy to say that while it's not Blade Runner, we both felt it really lived up to its reputation. A lot of fun, a pretty well-structured story (for being so complicated), and an emotional dimension that we both found compelling. Definitely worth a rental, even for non-sci-fi fanatics.
B004PGO25O|4.0|Enjoyed this read about the creative process, and is good for a well needed kick in the butt at times.  It is not as amazing as his &#34;The War of Art&#34;, a book which I definitely love.
0316228532|2.0|I did not read a review, watch any interviews, or hear anything about this book before I read it. I simply saw it in the store, picked it up, and bought it. The book was well written and had solid characters that were well developed. It's sad, and at times quite depressing, however, I don't mind a sad book and it was offset by some subtle humor and sarcasm. Unfortunately, for every positive the book offered, there are five negatives outweighing it. I simply did not like this book. It seemed that the author was trying so hard to show she could write an adult book, that she totally over-did it. It's like the Lindsay Lohan of books. She was cute, fun, and adorable. Then she decided she wanted to show everyone she was grown up, but goes way too far, and instead of coming off as mature and adult, it comes off as childish and completely inappropriate. The book had so much vulgarity and swearing, that it was hard to read. There were a few seriously disturbing scenes included as well. I couldn't enjoy the book. I read the majority of it, but could not finish. I kept waiting for it to get good, and it never did. There was nothing uplifting about the book, and every time I finished reading a part, I was left feeling uncomfortable and vacant. If you are looking for a book that is lovable, inspirational, good-natured, or fun, this is NOT the book for you.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|It was a good story, felt that James and Lydia were easy to picture, could predict the \\"twist\\" early on.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|Engrossing.  Surprise ending.  One thing that bugs about Ian is that he doesn't do much about physical descriptions, food, everyday things.  He's a plot man.  Fine, no Dickens.
B004RL9T50|2.0|Dull, dull, dull. Boring. Me, my wife and my 5 year old all started doing something else about halfway through.
B00AH8VU0Y|5.0|After a crazy season 1 and a comfortable season 2, season 3 throws the viewer right into the fire and drags them back to the hellish conditions of having to fight hand to hand combat with the undead. This season gets five stars. They took it up a notch and really listened to the viewer feedback. I can easily see this show lasting 5 or 6 seasons or even more. There is too much to tell and too many possibilities. Some really shocking events take place and a lot of unexpected twists and turns. This is the best horror/drama/thriller on TV right now, period. As I've mentioned before, I own this series in my personal collection and recommend it for adults, not for young children. Lots of gore and guts on this show.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|IT WAS THE GREAT ENDING TO THE BATMAN TRIOLOGY, I WOULD DEFINITIONALY RECOMMEND FOR AN ACADEMY AWARD.  GO SEE IT
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I bought this for my daughter. She is notorious for dropping her phone. She always has a case on it but it has never been enough to keep the phone from getting damaged. She loves this case. She hasn't had any horrible accidents since she got this for Christmas so I can't say for sure that it lives up to it's claims just yet; but I will update this review when she does.
B005K17RU0|5.0|great app for anyone to get the weather<br />set it up right and you can see it for every where
0618477942|4.0|I was not aware that this was in a comic book format and it took me a while to get used to it. However, once I did, I found the book fascinating and a good read.
B004A8EI9M|5.0|The Walking Dead is a brilliant zombie mini-series that follows an unlikely group of people trying to survive the zombie apocalypse. The writing on this show is very smart and I was pleasantly surprised on more then one occasion during the first three seasons. I won't ruin it for you but this is a show you must watch from the beginning. Don't cheat yourself out of a fun ride. I've already purchased seasons 1 and 2 for my personal collection and will buy season 3, once the full season ends. If you are a horror fan and like zombie flicks, you won't be disappointed. This is not a B-Rated flick, it's very good quality. I would not recommend this for young children as it is a zombie movie that has plenty of gore and guts in it.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|The world Erin Morgenstern created in this dramatic novel was astoundingly beautiful! The end was kind of cut short to me, like we built up this amazing hype, only to be slightly let down. I would still DEFINITELY recommend this to anyone!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I purchased this for my mother in law for Christmas because she is a big Dexter fan.  I think she watched them all by the next day :)
B007GE2H3G|2.0|Title says it all. Events were quite guessable.  I was not enthralled with the movie. Very lack luster.  The only good thing was the quality of the CGI animation.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|I chose this rating because there are not many movies that keep me interested and keep me guessing what will happen next.  There wasn't anything that I didn't like.  I didn't like the eyebrows of the younger Bruce Willis
B005WGBQ9G|4.0|I gave season 2 of The Walking Dead four stars. It was not as good or shocking as season 1 but very much needed to tell the big picture. It was a bit slow paced at times and quite shocking at others. Once again, the writing is superb on this show and really takes the viewer for a ride. You buy into the characters almost immediately and root for certain ones more then others. I believe once the shock of season 1 was over, season 2 lulled viewers into a false sense of boredom and safety. After seeing the first half of season 3, it is clear that this roller coaster ride isn't over yet and season 2 was a moment of peace in a crazy world. Everything makes more sense after season 3. I own this series in my personal collection and recommend it for adults, this is not good viewing for young children. You have to watch this show from the beginning. It's important to grasp the whole story.
B0083H6AQA|5.0|Great movie for those who like period pieces. Amazing cast of talented actors. Nice to see that Robert Pattinson can do more than look like a constipated vampire.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|Well worth the time to buy and watch...made for the deep thinker. Very interesting concept and believable characters.<br /><br />Like it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing book!  The characters were so real! I couldn't put his book down!<br />Cannot wait to read another one of her books!
B002VQ7PVS|5.0|This started out a little dull for me but after about page 20 I was hooked and couldn't put it down.  The tension and suspense keeps growing until the very end.
B003L77G6A|5.0|For anyone who loves to laugh needs to own all the seasons of Bid Bang!! I highly recommend these dvd's.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I choose this rating because the development of first chapter catches the readers attention to not want to continue reading without stopping.  The four agreements is a fast read that motivates one to continue the path in our human frailties with success.  I would recommend this book to everyone.

B00447G29S|4.0|There is so much to drink in this picture!  But I think ultimately it is a film about believing...and after seeing this, you will still ask yourself if you believe.  It is a eye-popping rollercoaster thrill ride to see Santa's castle and workshop up at The North Pole.  It is definately visual effects heavy, bolstered by some of the best effects people in the business, notably some of Lucasfilm staff lent a helping hand in the production of this joyride up north.  Without giving too much of the plot away, the film centers around the adventures of a boy who doubts the existence of Santa Claus, who wants to believe through the jingle of Santa's magic sleigh bells.  The boy literally hops aboard The Polar Express as it pulls up in front of his house, and suddenly he is whisked away where his adventure begins...all over the train, inside and out.  Then upon arriving at the North Pole, we go on a further adventure in and around Santa's toy factory.  It's all a real feast for the eyes, with surprisingly good music along the way.  Classic holiday songs are woven into the soundtrack at Santa's factory, lending more of an old-fashioned holiday feel to the experience.  It is dark and moody at times so you may want to caution your kids that it's only a movie.  My favorite sequence is in the train car of \\"recycled\\" toys, where the boy is called a Scrooge and a doubter by a mysterious hobo who seems to live on top of the train throughout his journey, and comes to the boy's aid in moments of peril.  Was this character meant to be a sort of antithesis of Santa Claus?  Will the boy ever hear the jingle of Santa's magic sleigh bells?  Well, hop aboard The Polar Express and decide for yourself!!!
0316228532|2.0|While there's no question of Rowling's ability to write and to develop characters, the emotional impact of reading this story was, well, like encountering a Dementor... the story sucks away what seems like every joy and happiness.  I'd only recommend reading this in order to study a well-written novel or if someone finds themselves too happy and optimistic about the world.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|For anyone who loves to laugh needs to own all the seasons of Bid Bang!! I highly recommend these dvd's.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|My 8 yr old granddaughter loves this game.  She played for hours and loved sharing her styles with me.  I agree with others there needs o be more customers.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Cool game. A little complicated but once you get the hang of it its fun! Keeps your attention and the rooms are cute! :-)
1844137872|5.0|I bought this for my son in law off of his wish list.  We looked through it when it came in and it is pretty cool!  Might have to order another one.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|There is some really funny stuff here (especially the stuff with Sam &#34;Flash&#34; Jones) but like most comedies it just goes on too long with the same setup for Seth's gags about 80's pop culture. What's great in a half hour show just seems to drag on in a two hour movie.
B0053O89WY|5.0|For anyone who loves to laugh needs to own all the seasons of Bid Bang!! I highly recommend these dvd's.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This is a sweet story of faith and perserverance. My 11 year old has watched it several times already but my older kids also have enjoyed it as well.
B001706I5I|4.0|The movie is so entertaining and there is never a dull moment. Love the whos and its a great Christmas movie.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|why were we not told of this in grade school. i guess we would not be willing to run into machine guns for love of country if the truth were known.God bless America!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I decided to read this book before seeing the movie. Also it was recommended by my older brother and sister in law after they gave me a kindle for Christmas. I was expecting a Battle Royale type of copycat story but was surprised to that the story and the fights were nothing to that level of violence.<br />I'll start with my one and only major complaint: the author uses \\"says\\" almost 98% of the time when anyone speaks! This is point when you use the character's words to describe what they are feeling or going through at that moment. Even if the whole story is done through Katniss` point of view, this one thing could have helped flesh out the scenes and emotions of the character's and also give them sense of movement.<br />My only minor complaint is the lack of detail or some background about the Capitol. Again, even though this is all Katniss view of the world it would have really set up the Capitol as the true enemy of everyone. From all the technology they have to medicines and just living comfortable off the backs of the weaker Districts and how they obviously cheat by raising and training Tributes, which is against their rules. I figure the next two books will elaborate of this.<br />Just those two things brought it down from a five star rating that it could have gotten. It is a very enjoyable read and the pace is really well set. It moves from really slow moments that catch off guard as something suddenly and unexpected happens out of no where, just to slow down again to set you up for something worse.<br />This is a fast read because of the way it is written. Everything is from one person's perspecive and sometimes leaves you wonder what might be going through the personas in the book. You learn who Katniss is but wonder about those around her. The language is pretty simple at best which also contributes to the fast read. Since this is set in a ruined America the terms and references to locations that have changed are easy to imagine.<br />I do recommend thisbook to teenage readers and to adults who want a good read that moves along well.
B000W91RUG|5.0|For anyone who loves to laugh needs to own all the seasons of Bid Bang!! I highly recommend these dvd's.

B0089AD8IO|4.0|I love Doctor Who and love that I now have the first series. There really isn't much to say about it, after all, it's the Doctor and there isn't much better!

B00AMBLXP8|4.0|I thought this was a great movie, some really funny parts, some parts that were a little over done, but for the most part a great comedy.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Superb acting in a true story where every parent/friend of a patient afflicted, or that patient w/ autism or Asperger's Syndrome should strive to watch. Deeply moving and prompts us all to help fund the various Autism/Asperger's Syndrome Foundations.
B000SEI230|4.0|A very good romance. Lots of literary elements were implemented. Possibly better for a younger audience, however. Overall a good and quick read.
B004BBDHEK|5.0|I am really enjoying this CD.  When I first got it I played it continously.  Yanni's music reaches across the world and anyone can enjoy listening to it.  I enjoy listening to it while I'm driving; especially during rush hour.  Very calming.
0395389496|5.0|i gave this to my daughter for Christmas.  She loved it and it has the ornament and DVD that came with it that made it even better.
B007IQX1G4|1.0|I rented this and probably watched a total of 10 minutes before i lost complete focus on the movie, so boring and stupid story line.
B005COO1X6|4.0|true Stephen King. was hard to put down. I'm looking forward to more storys by him. As a fan of his he didnt let me down.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of the best shows ever! We were THRILLED to watch season 3 in its entirity without commercials. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is a step by step tutorial.  It can't get any easier then this. If your constructing an ebook read this first !
8866130915|4.0|I was looking for a small calendar for my purse that wouldnt take up alot of room or be bulky. This one is perfect. I buy alot of moleskine books for mix media journaling art projects but this is my first calendar from them. I like that it has a band on it so it won't open while it is in my purse. It is small but there is room to write on each square for appointments etc.. I would have given it 5 stars had it come with a pen and a pen holder on the side, that would of been super handy.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|This trailer made this movie appear to be extremely funny, it was far from that, the only funny parts were what was shown on the trailer, I love chick flicks and this was soooo boring I couldnt even watch the entire movie ....
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game this game has over one hundred games in one app I regimens you get this game it is so awesome
B005LLSNNE|5.0|We loved season 4 of Sons of Anarchy! The quality of the video was excellent! I would highly recommend this purchse to EVERYONE!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Much better than previous versions of the game.<br />It's fun and it the shark moves easier on this version.<br /><br />Shark evolves into bigger sharks.  There are more areas to find and treasures to locate.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This was a gift for my mother. I didn't really know who this was but man what a nice cd. I love all the songs and mom went nuts for it. Well worth it.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|SOOOO good ... if you havent watched this you should go to netflix and start from season 1 and you will be waiting patiently for the next season!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the insanity created by the characters within this book. A novel that will definitely make you think and keep you guessing as you read!
B000641D2Y|3.0|Would have been cute if I hadn't seen the first one. Why? Because they're just too similar. Similar plot, same bad guys, similar touching scene at the climax of the movie. Done well, though.
B00846REIS|4.0|I enjoyed the book a great deal. Extremely erotic. Not as good as 50 Shades of Grey in my humble opinion but worth the read. A close second.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is a second version that I have ordered.  I have a kindle fire and this Kindle HD version worked fine. I have<br />enjoyed playing it and my 9 year old neice liked it also. Would recommend it for the whole family.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|I could care less what the movie is all about, however this was a funny movie and nothing to complain about the characters!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I gave this book a 5 star because it wa just that good to me. I would read this book again really because of how well it was writen
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Imagine Dragons is definitely a band worth to discover. Great rhythm, great sound, great musical atmosphere... I simply love it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I would recommend this erotic love story to any woman. My husband calls it the best books he's never read. It's a beautifully haunting love story with two well written characters. Their little quirks are just as lovely as their story. EL James was able to make two characters you love to love. My favorite romance read ever. So looking forward to more of this authors work in the future.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|The movie trailer doesn't do it any justice.  It kept me guessing on how it was going to end.  The ending was great it tied every thing together, I was not disappointed.  There is a good amount of action in this movie also.  If you like Bruce Willis' &#34;Die hard&#34; movies you will love this.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, it's amazing! College has done it again an  has a forever reader in me!
B0029XFNAI|5.0|This timeless classic is beautiful on Blu-ray and still carries with it the spirit of Christmas.  A must-see year after year.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have read all three books in this trilogy twice. I love how this book really delves deep into the story building more tension than the first book. Hard to believe but true. Bringing into play one of Christian's submissive's from his past was genius. EL James is incredible.
0307730697|3.0|Before SEAL Adam Brown went to the battle field, he asked that if he died his story be told. All of it. He wanted people to know what his life was like before Jesus. This man whose story of how he  physically excelled in the training was amazing enough without the story of his past. Adam Brown, Christian, Husband, Father, SEAL, was a former cocaine addict, in a hole so deep the reader is afraid for him and his family. When he came out of the hole he understood the prodigal son in Luke Fifteen, in a way some of us never will. I tend to read the prodigal son cleaned up- minimizing the dirt and pain of the son, and thereby minimizing the Grace of the Father who takes him home. Adam rips the &#34;cleaned up&#34; cover off the story, and shows us a prodigal son in a deep pit, afraid of dragging his loved ones in and yet unable to get out alone. It makes us realize that we are not clean, good hearted prodigals. We are the dirty ones, addicted to sin, we are the ones in need of Grace. We are the ones who have received the same Grace that God gave Adam for the same reason. We need it. Adam would be the first to tell us the choices he made were made without wisdom, that could have taken his life and he would be the first to point us to Christ, who saved him in a jail cell and showed him the love of his Fathers again. His Heavenly Father who welcomes him back with loving arms, and his earthly father, who came to Christ because of Adam's battle against the drug that sought to claim him, body and soul. We also meet Kelley, Adam's wife- a help meet fit for him. Her story is one of selfless devotion- from the nightmare of searching for her Adam in crack houses, to their honey moon days when he was training to be a  SEAL, she went through late night uniform ironing and early morning breakfasts to push Adam on to his goal. Her prayers carried him before God, and she encouraged him that he had more to give. The details of the drug use and some stories in here about Adam's life before Christ are so scary I cannot give this book to anyone under the age of eighteen at least.  The details of the training for the SEALs are awe inspiring- the human body is amazing. God designed us to take so much and keep on pushing forward. This is important to keep in mind, considering how Paul compared the Christian to a Soldier, and we have a Kingdom to Advance.  Thank you to Kelley and Adam's friends for telling his story. God protect out military and draw them to Himself. In Jesus' name Amen  The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team Six Operator Adam Brown.  Written by Eric Blehm

B007HJ91HU|3.0|I'm not a fan of remakes. They changed the story line a bit too much for me.  The original version was better and will always be my favorite.
B009K0OL06|5.0|Constant intrigue and plot twists.  Definitely an entertaining series.  Nice watching it on Amazon Instant Video without commercials.  Just wish they would put the HD versions on prime instead of making you pay for them.
B0056C6XIA|4.0|This kit comes with a multitool which is virtually the same as the Gerber Strata, except it has no replaceable carbide wire cutters, and of course has Bear Grylls branded covering. All non-plier related tools are accessible from the outside and have good locking. The blade is an easy one-hand open, if you're right handed, a little difficult if you are a lefty. Blade comes very sharp. Drivers are good, saw is good, scissors are good, can and bottle opener work as promised. The file is terrible. Ergonomics both closed and in plier configuration are excellent, but there's a lot of flex in the tool when using the pliers, and I wouldn't trust the tool to heavy duty plier tasks. The Multitool by itself weighs about 8oz.<br /><br />The Ferro rod with the kit throws good hot sparks. The 1xAAA flashlight puts out about 6 lumins, plenty for task light or in-camp tasks. Runtime on full charge should be about 14 hours. Don't expect this thing to be much use beyond 5 yards.<br /><br />The case seems durable, and securely holds the components. I found it very easy to attach/detach from a belt. whether the plastic will crack over time and whether the rubber flap and beltloop will dry out or turn gummy over time is unknown.<br /><br />I think there are much better Multitools out there but this is a decent tool. Mine had incredibly stiff tool locks out of the package but quickly eased up after a few days of fiddling with it. Overall, I was much more pleased with the kit as a whole than the tool just by itself.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|one very helpful app. no matter where i am, i just plug it in and it tellz me how much longer i have to surf the internet. I love to listen to music, and it tells me how much longer I can listen<br />  overall, it is awsome
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What's not to love about this saga?  We watch it with friends when we can.  Great classic series.  Good value
1592536913|2.0|While many of the items were absolutely gorgeous it was frustrating as hell that none of them had a description of what the item was.  Underneath the pictures is just the artist's name.  It was often very hard to figure out what an item was unless it was an obvious clock, \\"gun\\", lamp, etc.  So when you flip through the pictures you are constantly having to look at the number of the picture and then search in the back of the book for that photo's information to see what the items were.<br /><br />How hard would it have been to put \\"USB memory sticks\\", for example, on the top of the page and then show all the various creations?  Or just put a few words underneath to let us know what we're looking at?  Sad that something so simple could have made this book SO much more pleasurable to flip through - instead of annoying!

B0049P1VHS|4.0|This is the must have season #1 that brings all the story line, character and context background to the series.  That being said, some of the Computer Graphics in season #1 is REALLY Cheesy; especailly the epsiode where the Centers for Disease Control blows up.  They'd have been better to work with scale models than the unrealistic CGI.  Also, the it seems while the producers go to great lengths to employ realsim, some episodes and takes are truely UNREALISTIC.  For example in the episode where Main Characters walk into the &#34;gang&#34; enclave to rescue theor asian buddy, and only after heated words do they all decide to &#34;cock their pump shotguns...&#34;  HUH, really, You dont lock and load UNTIL you get inside the bad guys Lair!  Thats so UNREALISTIC.  And you have eough explosives to totall Destroy the ENTIRE BUILDING housing the Centers for Disease Control, yet you can crouch down 100 ft away in side your 1980's RV and never suffer any SHOCK concussion.  Ok, so the PHYSICS consultants were taking a break when that scene was shot.  I still enjoyed the story line.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I received these headphones a few hours ago an haven't taken them off yet. They're really excellent considering they only cost $100. I love the metal parts like the plug and driver housing. They fold well and are rather compact when folded. I like everything about these headphones except one thing: the ridiculously long cord. This cord could only be desired if you needed to plug your headphones into a device that's halfway across the country. If mobile listening is important to you, you might want to consider another option. The cord is around 5.5 feet long coiled, but can stretch out to around ten feet. Still, excellent sound. The included bag is nice looking. All in all great headphones. I'd easily pay double for the remarkable build quality and sound that these headphones have.

B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Makes you wish you could have a &#34;Ted&#34; in your life.  Mark Wahlberg is perfect as Ted's BFF!! One funny movie.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|I liked all these actors and although it was about baseball Clint manages in his own gruff way to teach us that the old have much wisdom to impart. Great little movie with just the right touch of romance
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|There isn't much I can say that others haven't already. I love the Resident Evil movie series, but this movie failed so hard in comparison to the first 4. I loved #1, #2 was decent, #3 awesome, #4 decent, and then there was this one, #5, and it simply wasn't very good. The story was terrible. Not the idea of the story, but the actual telling of it. It was just done poorly. Scenes were just jumping around, no build up, no feelings for the characters, poor acting...just overall a bad movie. I watched it, it was watchable...it just didn't meet the quality of the first 4 in any way. Felt like it sold off to some S***ty company (though it wasn't)...oh well.
0525478817|5.0|When I was first told about this book from a friend, I was hesitant. I mean, a book about a girl with terminal cancer sounds beyond depressing. I ended up buying it two weeks later, and I can't believe I turned this book down at first. The Fault in Our Stars is beyond amazing. The Fault in Our Stars is a story about Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters, two star crossed lovers who share their views on life, love and loss. Hazel is a 16 year old girl with Thyroid cancer and mets in her lungs, diagnosed at age 13, knowing that the miracle drug the doctors found is only prolonging her life. She was pulled out of school and isolates herself from any friendships she had, and relies mainly on reality television and her favorite book, An Imperial Affliction, to keep her company. After being forced by her parents to go to Cancer Kid Support group and live her life, she meets Augustus Waters, the metaphorically inclined boy who is in remission from Osteosarcoma. Hazel and Augustus revel in each other's opinions on life, death and philosophy. If you are the least bit hesitant about purchasing this book, buy it. It's the kind of book you will read over and over and just be completely amazed by.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Product is easy to use. I use it on my kindle fire and I like being able to write quick notes. The only thing I have a problem with is locking a specific note. I tried to hide a Xmas list, but couldn't figure out how to make it private. Still a great and simple product.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|Arrived quickly, great price, exactly as advertised.  Chose DVD over Blue Ray for price and also to be used on a computer
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a very nice camera bag that has many compartments to store camera, lenses, accessories and whatever else you want.  My only complaint is that it says amazon basics all over it (zipper pulls).  Since this was a gift - it would have been nice to not have something say &#34;basic&#34; on it.  My daughter really loves it.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this....
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|this is sooo much better then cut the rope it is the new thing totally i give it 5 stars and a thumbs up ! ! !
B009JBZH54|5.0|I ordered this as a gift.  I was afraid I wasn't going to have it in time for Christmas (since it was a preorder), but it was exactly what I ordered and it was delivered fast!  It made it in plenty of time for Christmas.  I am very pleased with this order!
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|This chapter with all the Avengers together was action packed with a couple of slow spots. One disappointment that I won't discuss. The Hulk cracked me up, he's so cranky. Now I can't wait for the next Ironman!!
B00005JNS0|5.0|Great movie even for adults it's so funny and My grand kids just loved it too. Will go out and buy Cars 2 tomorrow!  Just so you know, I am a Great Grandma so even us OLD LADY'S enjoyed it
031620157X|5.0|I must admit, I first knew of Chris Colfer through Glee...since then, though, I have been impressed by his remarkable versatility in a wide variety of areas--he's not just a teen actor, but a writer, producer, and director, though some of his original work is just getting off the ground. Still, I was not sure what to expect of a first novel, especially as a 20-year-old English major who usually reads classic works...<br /><br />I was drawn in from the first chapter--the introduction, in fact--by the compelling characters Colfer creates...though he absolutely stays true to the classic fairy tales, his twists reinvent them in a original way which will delight any reader. In addition, some may say that the twists were obvious...I suspected the biggest one after a while, but I was not sure, and suspecting meant that the hints placed in the story were letting readers figure things out with the characters--it did not stop me from crying when we all found out the truth together...<br /><br />All in all, a *wonderful* first novel, something I cannot wait to read aloud to my younger sisters! Absolutely recommended for any lover of fairy tales, fantasy, or good, old-fashioned adventures!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|fun, challenging, clever, creative and sooo much fun to play . . . and win. My children, however, progressed slightly further than I.
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|First time to play a game like this. Game was compelling but partway through you have to pay $3 to keep on going so &quot;Free&quot; ain't really free. We won't get fooled again.
B0021L8V0M|3.0|It was ok Not a fan of Angelina Jolie, it's okay at best wouldn't  pay money  to see it again!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|can not wait for season 2 to be available. could not stop watching this series once i started. probably have not watched that much television in one sitting in quite awhile.<br />this is a MUST see!
1400064287|4.0|The book was written in a very easy and fun way to read.  The authors (brothers), have broken out the value of a message, its construction and sustainablity measurements in both a very interesting and memorable way.  I used it to assist Lspba business clients seeking a theme for corporate transitions....something simple,relevant, sustainable , and of course meaningful to the mission and employees.  Im sure will enjoy this book.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I enjoy reading this story and it's many turns and trials.  I have since seen the movie and was glad I read the book first.  It was a fun read.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is adorably written while making me wish I had a dog to share my world with. Loved every minute of it!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|would highly recommend. but need to watch the previous seasons to know what is going on.<br />looking forward to next season
B003719GGS|5.0|Really great book.  Eye-opening.  I know it will greatly improve the relationship with my girlfriend, and soon to be wife.
B004LWZW42|5.0|Grandson love this. He was so happy when I handed it to him.  Recommend to buy any age. Recieved fast.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Never had played this before but love it.  Would recommend this for anyone with some idle time looking for a good game.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|A friend told me about this book, and I just loved it!  It did not end the way I thought.  Very great read!!!
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|If you're browsing this item, chances are you're already familiar with this music. It is just what one would expect - the famous Bob Marley songs. A piece of history.
B000I2JI80|5.0|Renders perfect skin tones. Perhaps a bit more temperamental when it comes to overexposing, but I'm using it in a Holga, so it's not a problem for me. Certainly something to keep in mind if you're using a high end medium format camera. It works well in overcast light.
B005R32L66|5.0|Of course Skype is good - it works great on my tablet and I look forward to using it often.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|You can't go wrong with this CD. Played it over and over and never got boring or tiring! Rod Stewart has that unique vocal quality that is so different from other artists. Listened to this CD while on the computer, while eating dinner, while house cleaning, while throwing a holiday party, in the bathroom...well you get the idea. Seller was prompt and sure beat spending my time and energy with the crowds this year. I like being able to listen to samples of the CD's before purchasing. Great relaxing enjoyable music!
B00A77II0U|5.0|This is among the best games I've had the opportunity to play on my Kindle Fire! I haven't been able to put it down since I started playing!
B002FRNCG0|5.0|Awesome sound quality and great songs :) Love Paramore such a great band and really awesome gift that I got for myself :)
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Another beautiful musical score for Twilight Saga fans.  Melodic & invokes pleasant memories of the movie.  Very enjoyable audio! Yay.
0446547654|5.0|I am a big fan and this was a good book.  Not my favorite Nicholas Sparks book, but it was good as they always are.  Endings are not predictable usually, but this one sort of was.  I hope he isn't writing the books FOR the movies.  It should be the other way around!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Great concept for a movie. The acting was top notch and the movie kept me guessing. Hadn't heard much about it prior to watching it so I was very pleased. I'll be buying this movie for sure!
B00004X10B|5.0|When I ordered this bag I swallowed hard as I spent $150 on a freaking BAG.  In the past I've spent between 30-40 for what I thought were pretty good camera bags.  But when I got it I immediately understood why.  It is a true workhorse, and it's HUGE.  The build quality is better than I've ever seen.  I feel like this bag could last my whole photographic career, and then be passed on to someone else.  I am shooting weddings lately, and being able to have all my gear (two Canon cameras, 4 lenses, 2 flashes, and a bunch of small things like cards and batteries) in one place, safely packed up, is very nice.  If you put everything inside in a way that makes sense to you, you can easily be in and out of this bag when you need to grab a new lens, change a card, etc, and go back to shooting.  The shoulder strap seems durable, though I'm sure they make a more comfortable one, but this isn't a bag you'll have on your back for too long.  If you fill it up, it will be HEAVY.  So the strap is just there for you to carry it to your location and work out of it.<br /><br />If you have normal sized lenses (I guess I mean prime lenses 200mm or under and zooms that aren't your crazy 70-200 Canon L series zooms) on your cameras, you should be able to fit both of them in the bag WITH the lenses on.  If not (I for example do use a crazy 70-200 Canon lens sometimes), you will probably have to store your 2nd camera without a lens attached unless it is really small like the 50 f/1.4 or something.  This is unavoidable though, unless they made the bag twice as big, which would be much too big to carry around in my opinion.<br /><br />If you are pro or semi-pro and wanting a great bag that protects your gear while giving you easy access on the job, I recommend you spend the extra money and get this awesome bag from Tamrac.  If you have less gear, maybe just one camera and a couple lenses, I'd definitely get a smaller bag, though still stick with Tamrac as they make the best bags on the market.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I can't stay away from this game. A lot of fun. The graphics are impressive. Some rooms are very challenging. They change every time.
0802473156|5.0|I LOVED this book.  It was recommended to me by a couple of friends and I am so glad I bought it.  Great price too!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book always keeps u on edge and always wanting to know what happens next. You should read this book ASAP.
B006YXTRHY|4.0|I read and enjoyed the entire series of books. Of all the movies, Breaking Dawn Part 1 was my least favorite. I didn't think I would watch it a second time, but then my husband hadn't seen it, so I watched it again. I have to say that I think I enjoyed it more the second time around!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this book in 3 days, very quick read. I was totally captivated! Can not wait to read books 2 and 3!
B006S8QY8K|5.0|If you enjoy ballroom dancing this is the movie for you.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Just an all around good movie.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I already had this movie but i love it and wanted to see it in 3D, so i bought it and have enjoyed, you will too.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Good to watch with your spouse or loved ones. Heart warming. Could be better if they could add in more comedy.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This is really a pageturner and not the cheesy romance novel I was afraid it could be. I would categorize it as young adult, but enjoyed it just the same. A good book is good regardless of the intended audience.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I am not into really graphic violence, and I found book one to have just the amount that was acceptable in my estimation, but books two and three seemed to increase the violence almost exponentially, and I am hoping not to have nightmares myself. If I, at 67, find it disturbingly graphic (albeit fascinating), I hate to think of my impressionable preteen granddaughter reading the horrific details. Kids are too desensitized  to violence already. I'd like to erase it off her Kindle if I could.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|Love this show, i have this season and will get season 2, cant wait to see season 3, this next season will have 24 episodes.
B008Q09K2U|3.0|After an unbroken run of brilliance I forgive Nelson for this unfortunate misfire. John Corey grated like never before and I agree with many others that Panther was simply too long and short on plot. One suspects Nelson himself recognises a less than stellar effort but with his track record I, for one, will still await the next De Mille classic.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I really loved this movie! I am a big comic book fan and love all movies about super heroes. The plot twists and &#34;surprise &#34; ending were the key to the movie's success.
B000FC12C8|3.0|i am interested in investing and this book had some good pointers, which I think will help me in the furture
B009NPM5Y2|2.0|script was terrible, singing was great. Tom Cruise was awesome. the male lead (not TC) was also very  unengaging. Could have used more Russell Brand to heighten the campiness.
B008XG1X18|2.0|All my friends have this app &amp; love it and I wanted to get it. Whenever i try and make an account IT has an error. I have tried 're downloading it &amp; nothing works.<br />PLEASE FIX.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|5 stars for the film, don't expect a lot of bonus features for the blu-ray.<br /><br />We missed this movie when it came out in theaters but since discovering it has become one of our favorite movies. It has a little bit of something for everyone, action, adventure, sci-fi/fantasy, romance and comedy. It is really entertaining and definitely has the re-watch factor.<br /><br />We ordered the blu-ray when we scratched our DVD up, and the bonus features and deleted scenes were the same. So that was disappointing but only because I love the movie so much.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|Just when you think it can't get any worse. Holy S*** they find a way to make it even more painful. It took really talent to find such a crappy  script cast it full of so many bad wanna be actors. Save your money don't waste your time.
B0038AL7M4|5.0|Fantastic and definitive version of this mostly forgotten cult classic.  Really decent image and sound quality considering the source material.  Not the clear as glass Blu Ray you may be used to, but still the best you're probably ever going to get.  Also includes each and every version of the audio track, nifty menus, and decent bonuses (even the ten or so seconds of Vincent Price voice over from the 60's AIP version).  Has convenient chapter stops so you can watch just one of the shorts if you like.  (To be honest: as gorgeous as Brigitte Bardot is in this movie and as wonderful the awkwardness of seeing Jane and Peter Fonda playing love interests for Jane Fonda's at the time husband) the main reason I bought this disc was for Fellini's bizarre, much imitated (especially by Dark Castle) mini masterpiece, TOBY DAMMIT.  I recommend the #@&* out of that one.  Good stuff all around.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|works perfect for opening all your pdf  reading mags that I download from the internet etc.  Yes i WOULD BUY IT AGAIN
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Words can't describe the ups and downs this book took me through! Such an amazing story with such deep characters, and the hopes of forevers...I couldn't put it down!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|The story is far better than the tv show, the dialogue between the main characters is well done, reading like a novel.
B004TN7QPG|5.0|Hi (and Happy New Year 2013 to all)!<br /><br />First off:  This is the most versatile, feature-packed e-Reader I have found (hence my buying it.  :-)<br /><br />Second:  My main &quot;complaint&quot; at this time is not with the app- it is that the newest version has been on the Google Play Store since December 28th!  I know that the Amazon Appstore often takes its own sweet time to release updates, but has actually been pretty good with this app.!<br />I'm not trying to whine, but the newest version does have some nice touches!  C'mon, Amazon... this is from a reputable developer!<br />Thank you...
B000IEXVCC|1.0|Watched this looking for the great movie heralded by reviews and was greatly disappointed. Pointless waste of time. You can do better...with ANYTHING else.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|From the point of view of a troubled teen, this book is very honest. It was a trip back to the days when you learned best through observation but reminded me that it is essential to eventually leave the wall and \\"participate.\\" Very well done.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|Very much enjoyed the movie as adaptation of the Hunger Games book, although some of the casting did not fit the book description.  The DVD extras were fine and interesting, as we hadn't followed the pre-released 'making of' youtube shorts.
B0052AC8C6|2.0|I would not let my child watch this movie. I don't understand why they put inappropriate things in movies marketed to children.  I understand that people will disagree and that's okay. To each his own. My honest opinion is that I am not comfortable letting my child watch this, and I have no desire to watch it for myself. Children are not as naive as some people would like to believe. They DO pick up on innuendo. I don't want them to hear anything that I wouldn't want them to repeat. I'm glad some people enjoy it. It's just not for me.
B007L6VR12|5.0|Wes Anderson has done it again! If you like his movies, you will love this one. I wish I could give this review six stars
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|Nothing too great in this movie. A few good laughs but overall it was not as funny as I expected.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|Everything was fine, no problem, but I have no idea why I'm required to print 12 or more words to let you know that.
B003TT2X72|4.0|This movie is probably the worst of the trilogy, with less action than the others.  Though If you like sci-fi, you'll most likely love this series.
B000065V42|5.0|This was a Christmas present for my grandchildren.  They saw the movie and wanted their own copy so they were very pleased.  I have not watched the movie myself so I cannot rate it.  Shipping was very fast and my grandkids liked it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is a very fun game and it does have a lot of games in the game 101games+31but thats why the game is sooooo cool!!
B0058EBNAO|3.0|Cant sign in to appstore so I cant download it so I cant try it out. Now my other apps don't work either. I don't think its the app its the kindle
B003O86FMW|1.0|Everyone loved the hunger games trilogy. Me personally I didn't like it. It's cruel,and gets somewhat boring after the first book. I Would not recommend this book unless you want to be heartbroken and bored.
B0057LUI0O|4.0|This movie was fun, with a good message for kids! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good kids movie.
0545128285|5.0|Even with 7 Harry Potter books, it's cool to have a book with the stories they talk about in the books and movies.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This was the free app of the day on Christmas Day and I have to say it has been one of my favorite Christmas presents!  We bought it for our Wii through Wiiware and we loved it as a family but it was a little difficult to control with the Wii controller.  On the Kindle Fire it is perfect.  I have gotten through the first level and look forward to more to come.  It is worth twice what the asking price is.  The only reason I hadn't bought it for my Fire is because I didn't know it was available in that platform.  One on my favorite games ever.
B0000669JL|4.0|Delighted to find this compact disk available through Amazon. I had previously owned it but was unable to locate after I moved to my apartment. So nice to have it again and delivery was made in a reasonable amount of time. Thank you.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Flow Free starts out very, very simple then as the levels progress it gets more interesting to the point you still make good progress and enjoy the experience.  As the levels get harder the enjoyment grows with each victory, some victories are hard to come by but a feeling of satisfaction comes with each win.  A very simple way to fill in a few idle hours.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Maybe I'm too liberal but there wasn't much that shocked me when it came to the &#34;adult&#34; parts. A great book with some catch lines that are for sure to stick around. It's a great book to read and escape the world for a while.
B009YG2ND8|4.0|From a guy who still plays Final Fantasy 1 and 2, I have to say it's a solid app. It follows the DS version exactly.Terrific fun. But you can buy the DS version at Gamestop for &frac14; the price. Literally. I have it with the sticker saying 4$. Good game, questionable price.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i love being able to go straight to a certain passage without flipping through pages and pages.  i like the search and hilighting functions, too.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Easy read. Very enjoyable!! Cute story line... Loved the characters and the story! Would recommend to my friends. Awesome! Loved!

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Typical Clancy!!!  Clancy goes into great depth with character and situation development.<br />I was wondering when he'd ever get the Ryans into the story. When Clancy develops the bad guys, you really get to hate them.<br />The whole plot is a terrifying &#34;what if&#34;.  I would recommend this book to President Obama so he doesn't screw up our defense and intelligence security.  Outstanding read and I'm not even finished reading the book (85%)!!!
B002DOSBMK|5.0|I found the plot/ storyline to be flowing with suspense and action at an enjoyable level.<br />The author clearly took carefull time with character development and individual details.

B004R92PYE|5.0|\\"Vices & Virtues\\" is a great Panic! at the Disco album.  \\"The Ballad of Mona Lisa\\" seems to be a fairly straightforward pop tune, and as the album's opener it is deceptive:  \\"Vices & Virtues\\" quickly gives way to interesting and eccentric dance beats.  \\"Let's Kill Tonight\\" has enough sarcasm to fit the tone of \\"Vices and Virtures\\", but then \\"Hurricane\\" rushes in, with Panic! at the Disco's trademark whimsically poetic lyrics (\\"I want you/to catch me like a cold\\", \\"I was a wolf/among the sheep/now I've got the wool over my eyes\\").  All the way out to the end I enjoy every song.<br /><br />There's a rather beautiful break in the middle with the ballad \\"Always\\", and while I tend to loop this album and replay it, I also often stop at the end and re-spin \\"Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met)\\" for its amazing rhythm and variety--it has soaring vocals, a bit of ELO-styled harmonies, clashing chaotic percussion, and a loud chorus with mellow crooning, all of it bookended by a children's choir singing in French at the beginning and doing a reprise of \\"The Ballad of Mona Lisa\\" at the end.  \\"Ready to Go (Get Me Out of My Mind)\\" has an '80s pop feel that Coldplay wished they could have achieved on Mylo Xyloto, and \\"Sarah Smiles\\" would have been right at home on Panic! at the Disco's album \\"Pretty. Odd\\" (which is also a great album); \\"The Calendar\\" is downright beautiful.<br /><br />That said, I think the most musically rich track has to be \\"Trade Mistakes\\":  it does an amazing job of ramping up and down, mixing beautiful strings, soaring harmonies, and fast-driven, percussion-heavy choruses.<br /><br />If you like Panic! at the Disco, you won't be disappointed with their third album.  If you're new to their sound, definitely go backwards and give \\"Pretty. Odd\\" and \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\" a listen.  Panic! at the Disco are a clever, creative band and I look forward to seeing what else they have to offer the music world.

B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great on the Kindle Fire.  Any fan of Star Wars and Angry birds will be happy with this game.  The game play is Angry birds/Angry birds Space with the fun of Star Wars characters thrown in!
B009DP9D6A|5.0|I didn't care for 4x4=12: there were just too many passages that droned on too long, and so the album quickly lost its charm.  \\">album title goes here&lt;\\" is a much better release, and I enjoy it a lot.  We have some guests like Wolfgang Gartner on \\"Channel 42\\", but most notable names here are Gerard Way (My Chemical Romance) on \\"Professional Griefers\\" and Cypress Hill on \\"Failbait\\" (on which Deadmau5 takes a back seat and they dominate).  \\"Channel 42\\" and \\"Fn Pig\\" represent everything I wanted to see in 4x4=12:  a compelling electronic beat and the knowledge of just how long to spin it before changing it up.  \\"The Veldt\\" runs over 8 minutes and you barely notice--it has a tinge of retro synth sound with breathy vocals by Chris James.  I also love how \\"Closer\\" opens with a re-do of the alien synth theme from \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\" and bubbles its way into a tune reminiscent of Daft Punk's recent scoring of Tron: Legacy.<br /><br />If you like modern-day electronic music with a bit of pop and the occasional retro nod, \\">album title goes here&lt;\\"\\" is a good investment.  It has both more style and more substance.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I enjoyed The Black Box. It is fun following Harry through his cases. I love how he does not follow the rules. The ending was not the best. Connelly  seemed as though he could not find the end to his story.

1449410243|5.0|Normally, this is not the type of book I would consider doing a review on. However, this quirky, offbeat, hilarious novel struck a definite chord in my cat-loving soul. The author makes many blatant and just as many tongue in cheek references to numerous adult subjects, all while putting a hilarious spin on things by applying the attitude of cats.<br /><br />Review by: Hitherandthee / © Night Owl Reviews / Full Review on NOR Website<br /><br />We received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.

B005THRU0C|5.0|Ed Sheeran. The voice that wakes me up, or sings me to sleep, or blasts out of my car as I drive down the road, or pours out of my earbuds. A voice in song that makes me smile,  and makes me cry, or makes me shake my head in disbelief. Because it is unfathomable that someone is as wonderful as this exists. Everytime I hear a song it's always new and wonderful. His talent is absolutely like no other, he is timeless, and perfect, if something humanly perect ever existed. It doesn't matter how mainstream he gets, he'll never grow old. And if you've never listened, then you're truly missing out. I love all the bonus tracks, and it was without regret worth every penny.

B0000DZ3IG|5.0|Every year around Christmas she wants to see the movie. Now she can listen to the music as well. She was very happy with it. And I love the extra song on the end ;-)
B004YM6JLO|5.0|TVD is my favorite TV show. It's imeasurable compared to something like Twilight or something else teenie-bopper of the sorts. It's sexy, and seductive, and gripping, and comepletely unpredictable. And I HAD to buy it. I've bought every box set up to this point and I'll buy every one until it ends. Such a good series with beautiful and wonderful actors and acresses. I just LOVE it! A must-see must-buy. I watch them over and over.

B009VYF5E2|5.0|I absolutely loved this series from day one.  I am a big fan of Medieval type movies and just love the idea of Camelot and it's knights.  I like how this series kind of gives you a version of how King Arthur and Merlin first became friends.  It's a neat and fresh look at the prequal to the main story!
0307719774|5.0|What a treat.  I got one for myself and 2 for close friends.  We all use it!  I have never been one to use a diary, but often wish I would write something down....not necessarily every day, but often.  This is perfect.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Years ago, I saw the play and loved the songs so much that I bought the original Broadway cast recording.  The movie brought back the magic of the story and songs for me.  I bought this soundtrack when it was on sale.  The voices of the actors are not as good as the ones on my cd but it is nice to have a mp3 version of these songs.

B009ANP4F4|4.0|Maybe the storyline didn't grab my attention but the DANCE routines kicked BUTT!!!!!  I loved all the dance numbers, but the one I liked the best was in the art museum,  The illusion/visual effects were &#34;Mind Blowing&#34;!  I'll be honest and say Step Up 3 was my over all favorite in the series so far, but the dancing in this one was AWESOME!  I hope they come out with another one next year.  It would love to see Channing Tatum come back to the series, (maybe with his wife, too!)  That would be fun to see!
B00169N0BK|5.0|Pricey but it works just as it should.  Accurate.  Easy to use. Have had others and this is the best.
B0096DZKZC|4.0|I would recommend purchasing this game over &quot;episode 1&quot;. SEGA obviously isn't going to update the horrific controls of part 1 anytime soon,but this game is a huge upgrade in comparison. Very fun and for only a dollar!!!

B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Good suspense thriller.  Mr Child does tend to get a little long winded in some parts, but good book overall.
B008K8U13K|1.0|The Sonic series is known for its great music, graphics and tight controls, which shamefully this game has none of ( especially the later). SEGA NEEDS to stop making &quot;sequels&quot; to this well remembered franchise. Even after paying for this I have to delete it...

B009VB97EY|4.0|The story line was ok, some of the male strippers were ok, but I wouldn't have liked it as much if it wasn't for Channing Tatum.  It just proves that every inch of this guy is fantastic, and he's one hell of a dancer, which is one of the things I really like about him.  I loved is dancing in Step Up and his moves in Magic Mike were awesome.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|I bought all 5 seasons and we watch an eposide about 2-3 each week.  I'm down to the LAST EPISODE of Season 5.  I can't wait until 6 comes out (though I know it will be quite a while).  BUY IT....YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I bought this for my parents, who were huge &#34;Upstairs, Downstairs&#34; fans when I was a kid. An amazing series, beautiful to watch with deep character development and a wonderful sense of class and history. I highly recommend...
B003PIUBZS|3.0|I liked Andy Whitfield's acting and the story was good BUT the CGI was really bad and the green screen backgrounds were so painfully obviously fake that it was distracting and disappointing. The extreme slow motion was waaayyyy to long and I got bored. So did my husband and we are big on action movies. Gory violence and all. I think they tried too hard to be like the 300 with a small budget. It just didn't work.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie was hilarious.  Fat Amy had some amazingly funny lines but I think everyone held there own.  I have quoted this movie nonstop since I watched it.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love it want pro version you should really get this app five starts  go app I think you should get it
B0007IYARE|4.0|I first read this book when it came out, and it seemed much more impressive then. Today it comes across much weaker, with the author constantly stretching and reaching and hanging a lot on sometimes very little. But it still gives the reader food for thought about a lot of previously unexplained things, such as was the Earth visited by extraterrestrials, who left their mark in ancient architecture and even human genetics. This book is worth reading once, then being put down while the reader mulls things over, and then considered a second time.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I recently have had several losses and it has been really hard to understand why.  This book has been not only an eye opener, but a great comfort to me.  I highly recomend this book to anyone who has lost a loved one.
B002APU580|4.0|This is a great movie, and thoroughly entertaining (even if you are not a 'pure' Austen fan).  It is just not entirely true to the 'true' Pride & Prejudice story, but quite a bit of 'artistic license' was used by the screenwriter and director.  You WILL recognize it as P&P for the first half of the movie, but the second half shows a nice (simplified) ending.  In summary:  A great love story movie - just not pure P&P
B000SZLSB2|5.0|I love all his music. Very thought provoking &  emotionally evocative. You just have to try it for yourself and see if it touches you.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The sneak peek into the third season is making me look forward to the twists and turns of the coming episodes. I'm curios to see the new characters that will be introduced. Loving the fact I can stream from amazon prime!

B000NA2776|5.0|Some of my European friends turned me on to Mika long before he had a hit or two here in USA.  This is a great CD from beginning to end.  I love every song!  Most is upbeat and the music alone leaves you feeling energized.  Ironically, my favorite song on the CD is &#34;Any Other World&#34;; the lyrics in this one are rather hopeless, but the music itself (without the words) is very haunting to me.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the way it was written by 2 different  points of view.  I was annoyed by the manipulation of the  female character it gave me a bad feeling.

B002ZCY7SW|5.0|My husband loves 24, it doesn't matter what the title is... Absolutely love it.  This was a good buy for the husband.  I haven't watched it personally, but I am sure the quality is great as well.. Amazon does it all for me except cook and clean my house.
B009K0P10K|5.0|You will need to start with season 1 as to come into the middle of it will leave you disappointed as the show builds on itself one episode at a time.
B009AMANBA|5.0|\\"Lincoln\\" is a marvelous portrait of our 16th president and his times, splitting the difference between hagiography and straight history. Spielberg has grafted the savvy conniving politician of Doris Kearns Goodwin's \\"Team of Rivals\\" with the otherworldly, solomonic martyr of post-Civil War history. The film focuses on the events of January 1865. The Civil War, all but won by the Union, is drawing its final labored death gasps. Lincoln is torn between an offer by Confederate representatives that might end the war (though short of an abolition of slavery) and the possibility of passing a constitutional amendment (with a Congress full of Union supporters) ending the practice. The film deals with the backroom dealing (including practices that were second cousins to flat-out bribery) that pressured lame duck congressmen to either support the amendment or to abstain from voting.<br /><br />Those who have read \\"Team of Rivals\\" won't be surprised by the portrayal of Lincoln as a complex man and a savvy politician. He brings the DC telegraph office to a standstill with a still-funny bawdy story about a portrait of Washington in a British privy. He and wife Mary get into a fight about Mary's worry about son Robert joining the army. Lincoln opines on his presidential powers to a rapt cabinet in one scene, then in another, bellows at them to get into line behind his leadership.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis is masterful is Lincoln, inhabiting his character to the point that you forget you are watching an actorly portrayal. But the biggest surprise was watching Sally Field (!) bring a lively (if questionable) portrait of Mary Todd Lincoln to the screen. Fields' Mary is tough, with a sharp tongue for politicians too eager to investigate her expenses than providing her with a livable White House. Her \\"madness\\" is explained away as a consequence of grief over son Tad's death in Lincoln's first term. Your mileage may vary, however, as did Robert's in later years, when he confined Mary to an asylum.<br /><br />Spielberg did a nice job bringing the look and feel of 1860s Washington to the screen. The Capitol dome was painted blue, the streets were unpaved (if unpoopy) and the president ferried around the city in an unroofed carriage. Tad Lincoln had the run of the White House and Robert Lincoln WAS at Appomattox for the surrender of General Lee's forces. The loving fatherly scenes of Abe and 12-year-old Tad were touching and beautiful. Some critics might wonder whether Abe was really as saintly as Spielberg made him out to be. In some scenes, a halo is all but visible, and the adulation of those around him borders on the mawkish. A scene in which ordinary soldiers recited the Gettysburg Address was moving, yet discordant in its unlikeliness. Certainly, there were more than a few - Democrats and Southern sympathizers - who considered him a figure of satire and cruel vilification. And while Spielberg put drama into the passage of the anti-slavery 13th amendment, the celebratory scenes at its passage seemed doubtful. But all in all, \\"Lincoln\\" brought a measure of complexity to one of the most pivotal figures in American history.y to an asylum.<br /><br />Spielberg did a nice job bringing the look and feel of 1860s Washington to the screen.

B000FC10MU|5.0|Having gotten a taste of his mischievous style in \\"Good Omens,\\" co-written with Terry Pratchett, I took my first dive into the Gaiman sea with \\"American Gods,\\" my first experience wholly with the author. I loved it!<br /><br />AG tells the story of Shadow, a recently-released penitentiary inmate, who runs into Mr. Wednesday, a bad-Santa-like man who seems to know far too much about Shadow's life. Shadow can't shake the man, and soon, the pair are working together, meeting a strange array of characters claiming to be leprechauns, goddesses and gods.<br /><br />The old gods were brought to America in the minds of immigrants, and are on the verge of dying from lack of interest in them. Hurrying them along to their demise are the new \\"gods\\" - Internet, world, town, media and others. Wednesday hopes to round up enough of the old gods to fend off the new in a battle that is gathering strength.<br /><br />I'm not sure there were many deep messages in the book. The old gods, however, are described as powerful, earthy and dangerous. They continue to demand blood sacrifice and worship, which Gaiman contrives to give them in ingenious ways. The new deities, though dangerous enough, seem shallow and ethereal. Perhaps they will be better fleshed out in the sequel that I understand  that Gaiman is contemplating.<br /><br />American Gods is fast paced and engaging, though it stumbled badly about two thirds of the way through when Shadow endures a rather dreary and lifeless metamorphosis. Luckily, Gaiman resumes the book's pace and lighthearted sense of menace. The book is full of violence, usually implied, and some sex scenes that are mind blowing. Christian, Jewish and Muslim readers need not fear sacrilege - their divinities and pantheon don't appear. Only Christmas is mentioned - as a season rather than as a religious observance. AG is not a book for kids, though I understand from my nephew that it was used in his high school senior English class. Before buying, consider the maturity of your young reader.<br /><br />Neil Gaimann's writing is playfully intelligent and darkly comical. \\"America Gods\\" convinced me to read more of his work.turity of your young reader.<br /><br />Neil Gaimann's writing is playfully intelligent and darkly comical. \\"America Gods\\" convinced me to read more of his work.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|It was predictable, but if your just looking for a funny movie, for a good laugh, I would recommend it.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I read this book in two sittings and it was enjoyable. A little bit like 50 shades, but more like the PG 13 version. Well - off troubled male meets unassuming and previously unnoticed female, and its small triumphs and tragedies on their way what they hope will be a happy ending.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I only recently discovered the Harry Bosch series and have read them all at least three times in the past couple of years. They all are well written and edited and keep my attention.

B0013KTGAG|3.0|Looked great, had some great ideas that left me thinking a little, but the horror tropes got in the way of what could have been truly amazing. I'm not sure I have any specific ideas about HOW that could have been done, but then again I'm not a director.<br />It's not bad at all, I liked watching it, it just sort of lacked something, despite it starting out as really incredible IMO.
B00637D114|5.0|What can I say?  I am a child of the eighties and it was very nice to see the smurfs brought to the big screen.  The best thing of all, was that it was a great movie with great actors and not a single curse word was said.  It was refreshing to see that a great story can be told without violence and at the end I felt good and it lasted several days.  I am looking forward to part two.
B004EPYZV2|4.0|The title says \\"Mission impossible\\" but, as demonstrated by the movie, the mission was completely possible. It would have been much more accurate to call it \\"Mission Improbable.\\"
B003G4W49C|3.0|This book was great. It appealed to many wars and how we never truly know our enemy or why there really our enemy and how society or the world manipulates you, people manipulate you to  mold you into something better or worse.

Honesly, I can't belive I wrote  the review above.
B005K15XR4|5.0|Two Steps From Hell is an amazingly consistent band that has very few bad tracks to them because of the style of music that they creat.  That can easily be applied to this album.  It's been a very enjoyed Christmas gift that is part of a collection of their great music.

B00A6SZRJ0|5.0|I am very pleased with the new CD from TSFH.  There are some new aspects behind this CD that are different from what I've previously heard, and I like it.  You get new stuff that is great, and tracks of the similar style of previous albums that keep the feel of the band.  Wonderful CD and worth buying.
B005P5TQPU|4.0|was missing an episode so I downloaded to fill in the blank.  It was good - the seventh season is not my favorite and I'm missing Jim Beaver :P
B001GQSY5U|5.0|If you are a fan of Star Wars: The Clone Wars, this movie is a must have. Great story. Obi is awesome as always. Ahsoka fits in well. Great to see how she got her nickname. Fantastic light saber duels and fights. This movie has it all.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|I wish all the movies could have been as good as the first and last movie in this series. I enjoyed all the movie. I get it. Movies will never be as good as the book counterpart. This movie was loads of fun. The most fun since the first movie. Snape is a good guy. Harry Potter dies but chooses to live. And Voldemort is killed off for good.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|It was a good movie with good acting and outstanding visual effects but the story was kind of screwy.  Left me wondering why this alien race wanted to destroy humanity.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|My new favorite up an coming author is Colleen Hoover. Did not disappoint, I loved the characters and I thought it was wonderfully written.

Only one thing fighting for order in the chaos...judges.\\" In the future the justice system has changed and now justice is dispensed by urban cops called judges. They are judge, jury and executioner of all people with the one named Dredd (Urban) being the most feared. I have to admit that I was very leery of this going in and that is only because I have seen the Stallone version a long time ago. That was not a good movie. Compared to that one this movie is great, standing alone it's OK. It may just be me but I just could not really get into this movie. The action is good and the story is actually not that bad but for me it just couldn't hold my attention. Im sure many people will love this movie and will watch it regardless of what I say but for me there are many other sci-fi action movies out there there are much better, the new \\"Total Recall\\" being one of them. Overall, not bad but hard for me to stay focused on. I give it a B-.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Great movie enjoyed it much.  Classic story of how the rich upper class view the poor and lower class citizens.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book was one of the best books that I've  read in a while. I think it's because  the fact that this  is a classic, because of my enjoyment of this book I'd recommend it to pretty much anyone who wants to read a classic:)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It held my attention.  I read it in one day.  It was fun to see this guy get back his life
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Jah Live. Jah Cheap. Jah Buy. Jah Awesome! How can you go wrong with Bob Marley Mon? He be the reggae legend yah know! One Love!
B006C45LHA|5.0|As an old west fan and a science fiction buff I thought it was a great movie.  It's good to see aliens that aren't bullet proof for a change.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Chip Chip Chip Chip.. Awsome Blossom app of all times. It's the new classic after micky mouse and family. Now Its Angry birds and enemy :D
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hesitant to read this, fearing it would be like another twilight book. But I was pleasantly surprised and the book captured me.  The writing style took some getting used to, but I worked through it and enjoyed the book! Now for book 2!!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|The kids loved it. It streamed quite nicely. They shut up for 2 hours and it was some of the best peace and quiet ever.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|It's a really funny show and I enjoy watching it.  I think it's neat how the shows characters interact.  Sheldon is a trip.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|It is definitly different fm Diner dash!  it looks and plays very well on kindle HDs, please send new updates soon!<br />thx
B005VPRDAY|4.0|I am glad I bought these legos but there were definitely less than I thought there would be. If I could do it over again, I would just buy the Friends sets. On the plus side though, there is plenty of room in the bin to store more legos. My girls LOVE the girly legos!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is such a good mix tragedy and love. I fell in love with all the characters and couldn't put the book down.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Fantastic visual effects.  As a retired sailor I was pretty impressed on how well the actors portrayed Navy personnel.  I thought the story was pretty cool how it took an old battle ship to defeat an alien invasion.
B006LSZECO|4.0|But in a good way. As you go through the book the story unfolds and you couldn't guess what will happen next. I totally enjoyed it.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I know this because the networks always cancel the good shows.  I saw a few of these when they came out but did not get to see the first few.  I ordered the entire first season so I could watch in order.  This is a good show.  Stephen Amell has my vote to play Christian Grey when they make the movie &#34;50 Shades&#34;.  He would be someone I would turn my head to look at. HOT!!!
B002QS1O36|5.0|Purchasing and downloading this movie from Amazon was seamless.  I have always loved the movie and now I can watch it on a airplane flight.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|It's a great asian form of solitaire.  The graphics are very clear aqnd crisp and the game is eaqsily set up.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is our favorite ever. Love the humor, music, and we decided we need our own copy. Some of the best lines ever....&#34;we thought you was a toad!&#34;
B008PZ69T8|5.0|I love listening to this CD.  Now when I read the book, I know what songs they are talking about.  So soothing to hear those angelic voices on track 6.
B008RTE09S|5.0|I loved this movie, surprising, funny, looks great-- much better than I expected after all the bad press I've seen over the years.  (one reason for that: it was shown in black&white when it premiered on the BBC; there's no way it can come across w/o all the color.)  Don't have too high of expectations and you'll enjoy it.  And if you're a Beatles nut you'll love it.<br /><br />The race scene is a crack-up, looks like something right out of Top Gear (ahead of it's time).  And the music is just fabulous.
B009KHCT94|2.0|Kind of corny, acting not that great.  I kind of got the fealing that it was spoof on science fiction movies.  Visual effects were decent.
B00004RJB5|1.0|I can only hear the overture music, which sounds wonderful but is not entirely clear.  I only see black and white moving marks where I should see the musicians.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|From Charlize Theron's fantastic costumes to the settings and journey into the fairy world, this is a work of art. Kirsten, Chris, and Charlize are believable characters. The movie moves at a fast pace and kept my attention.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Maybe Pudding Monsters boils down to a 'match three' type game, but it's more fun and challenging.<br />Good one!<br />Plus I like cute games and this one has it.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|Good short game.  Easy to navigate and entertaining without being frustrated.<br />It may be too easy for some.  Good for beginners New at playing these types of games.
B00AKKS278|5.0|A case of right place at the right time for me.  I was looking for a new routine / way of thinking about my day and was so glad to read Hal's book.  I love the formula and have been doing the Miracle Morning for 20+ days now.  Love the energy & focus it gives me for the day and for my goals.  A definite read for all seeking to find the way to fill the gap between where you are and where you'd like to be/go.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As always, a great book by Vince Flynn. Difficult to put down, and now I am just waiting for the next one to come out.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|It was good, first one was the best.  Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones really are great together.  They compliment each other perfectly.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Amy and Nick Dunne are getting ready to celebrate their fifth anniversary when Amy vanishes from their home.  Nick quickly becomes the number one suspect in her disappearance.<br /><br />The novel is cleverly written from both Nick's and Amy's view points and none of them can be trusted as they both have an agenda. Who are really Nick and \\"Amazing Amy\\"? What made them fall for each other?<br /><br />I loved how how the craziness of Amy's and Nick's relationship and characters was unveiled little by little. The characters are also part of a bigger picture in which storytelling and appearances are all important. The story unfolds in a disenchanted world, in which the two heroes have lost their jobs and \\"chosed\\" to return to Nick's hometown. And this does not look like back to lovely countryside: \\"\\"When Amy talked about moving back here, back along the Ole Mississippi River, with you, I pictured... Green, farmland, apple trees, and those great old red barns. I have to tell you, it's really quite ugly here.\\" He laughed. \\"I can't think of a single thing of beauty in this whole town. Except for my daughter.\\"\\"<br /><br />The cynic in me absolutely loved the plot, but I also found Amy, Nick and the disenchanted America described in the book quite disturbing. Therefore, I would advice sensitive readers to proceed with care. Lovers of smart, witty writing: this one should really please you!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you like zombie films or video games, this is a great show.  Season 3 continues the great story started in the first two seasons.  The excitement and suspense continue to grow.  This is a well-made, well-produced show and has great acting.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|A real classic and always great for a good laugh.  This was purchased for kids who were too young to see it when it first came out and they've all watched it now about three times.
B009JBZH54|3.0|The first in the trilogy was the best, the others are so so.  I would watch it again and again.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|A wel written, delightful storylinethat gets you thinking of some of the more important facets of life.<br />Looking forward to her next book.
B000PMG16U|5.0|My favorite trilogy is the original, probably because I saw it first and grew up with it.  But, despite the 2nd trilogy (the prequels trilogy, episodes I, II, and III) having their shortcomings - as does the first trilogy in some respects - this set of films is also pretty good for the most part and shows us another side of Star Wars, and takes us back before the time of Luke Skywalker, prior to the events of A New Hope (episode IV).  It explores the stories of Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and others.  Worth seeing and owning a copy of, for any Star Wars fan.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie you are missing out.  It is quite a hit with most everyone who has viewed it.  Hopefully everyone who hasn't seen it will put it on their list of 'must haves'.
B005LAIHZE|5.0|5 star for the price from Amazon lightning deal, 4 star for the movie! They did a decent job trying to get as much as they can into the movie from the book. As usual, the book is 100x better, but the movie was very entertaining. Good cinematography and good acting. Obviously, I wasn't expecting an Oscar nor complete historical accuracy, but the guys loved it. My husband said he was actually surprised and is now a big Lincoln fan, lol. I've always been a Lincoln history buff before I read the book or saw the movie. This just made him &#34;cool&#34; to the kids today, and most of them don't really care much for American history, sad to say. You have to look at it from an &#34;entertainment&#34; point of view and not as an &#34;insult&#34; to our president. Keep an open mind when you watch this movie. That is all.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|This is truly an overrated book. About half way in the book it \\"jumps the shark\\". Not realistic anymore...more like 50 year olds than teenagers...too hurried and HOPELESS.  I was angry at myself for finishing it. Absolutely HORRIBLE!!!!! I mean seriously..... I wish I  had a V8!
B004KKX80A|5.0|Los chicos se divierten mucho con estos juguetes, este en particular es muy fuerte es duro y divertido es de muy buena calidad
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|This was the best purchase I have made on amazon. The wand worked like a charm! I thought it would have been more complicated to set up or use, but this wand works beyond my expectations and is really fun to use. The directions are simple to understand and the wand is easy to set up! I am ordering another one for my nephew today because this wand/remote just works, and since my nephew is a Harry Potter fan, he will love it!<br />One side note when setting up or programming the remote, make sure you once press the button on the remote your learning from &#34;once&#34;. I realized quickly that I had taught my wand to use the TV power button twice because I &#34;held down the power button&#34; when I was training the wand. You do not need to hold down the button on the remote you are training from, just point at wand and hit button once, and you should not have any problems.<br />This wand is super fun to use and works beyond my expectations, it just works! Great for everyday use, and if u think it will be hard to set up or that it will get old after a while, you are wrong! This becomes an extension to your hand and makes watching TV super fun and easy. The device just knows what you want it to do, I even tried fooling it by mixing commands and I still couldn't confuse it! Great device and props to the developers of this device!
B009AMANBA|5.0|Not when there are already dozens of reviews, some excellent, some abysmal. Not when the subject involves so many antecedents and complexities. I couldn't imagine doing the film, or myself, justice within the scope of a few hundred words. However, an amazon friend, a citizen of Germany working in China, has sent me a request to explain why I found this film so successful. Here's my answer, which I might as well share:<br /><br />\\"You might need to have spent some of your youth celebrating Lincoln's birthday, or noticing Lincoln's picture on the penny, or reading some of the pop boys' books about the War. You might need to have read Walt Whitman's Civil War poetry, especially \\"When Lilacs Last etc\\", and more than once. Lincoln is a powerful shamanic totemic figure in the American mind, and seeing him made human by DDL is like being told yes, there is a heaven for pets or yes any child can become president. But the film handles the assassination with the greatest cinematic subtlety. Of course I've know about the assassination in great detail all my reading life. Of course I know the Gettysburg Address by heart (though generations younger than I am probably don't). Well, there came that moment in the film when the capstone had been placed, when the passage of the 13th Amendment had been achieved -- and any blathering fool who still argues that \\"the War was not about slavery\\" should have his mouth taped shut as teachers used to do in the USA in 'the good old days' -- that moment when in effect Lincoln had become immortal morally, and at that moment I sat in the theater agonized by foreknowledge, horrified by anticipating the next scene, which could only be the assassination. Oh no! No! Not now! let the Glory wave a short while! I'm not a guy who cries in cinemas, but I couldn't stop myself from bawling as if a close friend or sib were dying in my arms. Lincoln's death became a personal tragedy for me, for the first brief time, at that moment in the film. My dry historical awareness of the tragedy will never be merely intellectual again. Wait! Not yet! Spare me the scene of his death! I WANT HIM TO LIVE!<br /><br />And the film did spare us. The indirect treatment of the assassination was superb, humane, decent film-making. Proof, I'd argue, that \\"less\\" is sometimes \\"more\\", that dispassion can be more poignant than blaring cinemascopic 3-D amped-up violence.<br /><br />Perhaps not everyone in the audience was as affected as I was. There are people who quibble with DDL's portrayal of Lincoln as insufficiently awesome. There are people who ardently despise Lincoln as a tyrant and desecrator of \\"our\\" Constitution. My response to the film was personal and private, linked to my own life experience in the Civil Rights movement. But that response was more intense than I expected when I bought my ticket. More intense than at any film I've seen in many years.\\"al awareness of the tragedy will never be merely intellectual again. Wait! Not yet! Spare me the scene of his death!

B00A757EFW|1.0|I thought I would like this game since it was one of many favorites as a kid, but you can only play one level.  Uninstalled it.
B004KKX814|5.0|Los chicos se divierten mucho con estos juguetes, este en particular es muy fuerte es duro y divertido es de muy buena calidad
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Not bad movie. Simple and easy to buy and stream to my tv. Laptop or iPad through amazon instant video.<br />Story line was interesting and kept my attention to see what happens be next.  Very funny
B006MW3V6U|4.0|We loved Season 1 and we are very much enjoying Season 2 but it seems Season 2 comes without &#34;Closed Captioning&#34;. So we are often rewinding to hear what we missed.
B002VPE1WK|1.0|Bought this case several months ago for a trip that I just returned from. During the week of vacation the small loop on the top of the bag, carring loop, began to fry and noe is pulling apart. I have not used this case other that this last week. ery disappointing. Now, because I bought it so long ago, but never used it, I can not return for a refund. Will never buy these types of products from Amazon again.
B0098460O4|5.0|Un CD maravilloso con las canciones mas hermosas que he escuchado en voces jóvenes que orgullo saber que tenemos en el mundo tanto talento
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Love story line and intriguing puzzles. It doesn't  just give mindless hidden objects screen after screen. Great job and keep up the good work.
0979019710|5.0|WOW!  Who wouldn't want every day to feel like Christmas?! That's how I feel after adding The Miracle Morning to my life! I have read many self help affirmational books. Some, that were too boring to finish because I'd heard it all before, and some, that were way over the top; but there are times when we need to hear something over and over again before it clicks and this one deinitely clicked! Coming from a person who in years past had suffered with depression in the winter months (aka SAD) I would have preferred to stay in bed with a pillow over my head, but not anymore! Because of The Miracle Morning, which I found to be a quick and easy read; I truly get excited to get up in the morning! I'm smiling more, loving life and just happy to be \\"me\\". I find myself going to bed earlier, so I can get up and enjoy my morning routine! I've always said that Life is full of choices and if you're looking to make a change for the better, please choose The Miracle Morning, I think you'll be glad you did!
030758836X|5.0|I could not put this book down it was that good, I recommend this book!! It is very well written and keeps you wanting more.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Hi my name is Jimmy  so good book and yep need some more words theirs we go nope bjdkddkkdkdkd almost there peanut butter jelly time<br />Ok
B002HWRYJE|5.0|There have been a lot of Star Trek movies over the years, but I have to say that this one is the BEST!  Not only does the story keep you involved, but the acting is excellent too.  Besides, this film has a J.J. Abrams vision throughout it...what more do you need?
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I just finished reading it, and I Am full of emotion! The dog, Enzo, is an amazing philosopher. You will laugh, you'll cry, you'll get angry, and you'll fall in love with this book. Life lessons abound.
B003VS0CX8|4.0|When I tried the Blu-Ray DVD Feature on my Samsung Blu-Ray player, I could not get to the menu.  When I looked on the Internet, I found out that the Blu-Ray  DVD Feature does not work on Samsung Blu-Ray players.  The other two discs worked fine.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I enjoyed the beginning of the book, the way it kept me enthralled, great imagination but coming to the end it started getting ludicrous & of course I was disappointed with the ending
B00APUQRPC|4.0|A lot of baseball movies have been made.  This one has an interesting premise.  Whoever you are, you can probably relate to one of these characters in one way or another.  Plus, I like how the storyline develops.  One caveat: I could've done without so much 'old man cursing'.  It wasn't really necessary.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|This movie was very hard to follow along. I thought if I watched it all the way to the end, I might be able to figure it out. That proved ineffective for me.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Good trilogy for long breaks. Once my 10 year old daughter started this book, she had to have the next 2 in the trilogy! Loved them all!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such a great book.<br />It really left me on the edge of my seat...literally. Really glad I read it. Perfect.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I think Tom Cruise is a little bit creepy in real life.  As an actor, however, he is passionate about what he does and it shows.  It's always cool to see the stunts in this film series and all the gadgets the agents use.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I found myself thinking the relationship between Sky and Holder was more of an adult relationship not a teenage relationship. As the mom of an 18 year old boy, I don't believe he (my son) could cook a meal (much less go buy the groceries to cook the meal) like Holder and wondered where Holder came up with his \\"wisdom\\" in getting Sky through regaining her memory. The interaction between Holder and Sky was too much for me to take seriously. Overall I wouldn't recommend this book.
B008469DGY|5.0|This game is fun and challenging. Great graffics wil regimens if you like challenging game .  Nice jobworth the money
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like this app on my kindle fire. Showing the history of the number is my favorite. Thanks for the creation.
B000957O7S|5.0|This movie has an interesting storyline to keep you entertained.  Whether you're watching it for the first time or the tenth, the story and characters will make you want to watch it again and again.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|What is different about this game is that there are many different combinatons of ways to get three stars on a level. This is great for younger children in the way they strategize. Their progress is not measured in fewest moves to succeed or other ways, just simply if they can.cover the stars with the blobs without sending them shooting off the table...which is hilarious anyway. I do not find the ads distracting on the free version as they are very small at the bottom of the screen.<br /><br />five stars!
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Sometimes in life we need support from those who care about us in the form of a hug, and other times the best thing for us is a kick in the pants to get us moving on the things we should be doing. This book takes care of the latter beautifully. <br /><br />This book will remind you that you have a calling, something in life you are meant to be doing, and help you identify and overcome all those reasons for you not currently doing it. He then uncovers how you can take it seriously, but not personally. Here are two quotes that have stayed with me:<br />'The professional loves her work. She is invested in it wholeheartedly. But she does not forget that the work is not her. Her artistic work contains many works and many performances.'<br />'The professional cannot allow the actions of others define his reality... Nothing matters but that he keep working.'
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was intrigued throughout the entire book! Couldn't stop reading! Best book I have read in quite a while! Definitely recommend!
B0093H8H8I|5.0|the good:<br />Great Packaging<br />Simple installation<br />attached Self-adhesive heat-transfer pad did not require alcohol and thermal paste<br />Great bang for buck<br />Fan is included—quiet and efficient
B002SRQ214|5.0|A more than adequate up grade from my over-worked dual core. The major plus was the killer cooling system, similar to the Cooler Master four rod system but of an appropriate size. Easy installation and worry-free operation. Well worth the price.
B007J2TMQ0|5.0|It's a grim reminder that the human being is a complex yet fragile animal that can be kind or cruel, timid or brutal, all in a heartbeat.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Me and my brother really enjoyed this game. You can design the characters however you want to, like changing their hair different colors, cutting it in any way, shape, or form, and lots of accessories!  I RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR ANY AGE.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love to play this game. Its a challange each time with your aim. Hopefully improving your score each time you play.
B0054YH8DY|5.0|This was an album that my husband had while in college.  I just had to get it for him for Christmas.  AWESOME!!!
B00873GRU4|5.0|Very realistic view of a possible future. Couldn't stop reading it. Immediately downloaded and read sequels. Can't wait for more!
6305692572|5.0|I bought the DVD just because of Andy Garcia.  I knew nothing about the story.  It is an excellent story and very well acted ... of course!  The story is about alcoholism in a family structure.  It is very real.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Story was very captivating.  Kept my attention from start to finish.<br />I recommend this book to anyone needing a good read.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|How could I not give the highest rating? This is a perfact buddy movie. My bear and I watched this movie together and we both agree, GREAT&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;
B002NZTZ8S|4.0|Easy and enjoyable to watch.  I would recommend both for Tweens.  Love the service and how convenient it is to rent.
B0090X4GLW|2.0|I was really disappointed that full versions of the songs were not included on the soundtrack.  Would it have been so difficult for them to record the full version instead of just including the shortened versions that appear in the movie?  To me this was incredibly lazy.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This has happened with a few of the kindle books I have ordered. Some of the words don't have spaces inbetween them for example: itis or hellothere.
B001QB5S3G|3.0|So much more could have been done with all they had,great actors,location of some of the last great natural places of the world, and true exploited natives of that land. IT seemed to me halfway in they rushed to cut this thing together.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|This is currently $3.99 for the kindle version. I don't know if it's always that price, but if not, then get it while it is!<br /><br />I thought this would be a book I'd want to read (I don't think I've read a sports biography type book before), and when I saw it at $3.99, I was bored, so got it and started reading. I couldn't put it down... I got to bed later last night than I wanted..<br /><br />I recently rekindled an interest in endurance sports after doing practically nothing for the last 15 years. From his dates in the book, I think Scott Jurek is either my age or one year older. I sure wish I was reading this book 15 years ago, I wonder if it would have inspired me to keep doing what I was doing then (and restarting now). I connect with his sarcastic yet intellectual story telling; oddly, I would compare (slightly) his writing style to that seen by Salinger in [[ASIN:0316769177 The Catcher in the Rye]]; some may disagree, but I thought this right from the start and maybe that's why I enjoy the writing as well as I do (this is just my thing). Some of the characters in the book just have fantastic stories; I'm sure some are true, some less so (i.e. some of the 'rumors' on Dusty as a kid), but all are fascinating.<br /><br />The other really nice part of this book are the running and vegan cooking tips. Both are just great. The running tips connect to something I'm studying right now anyway (reading [[ASIN:B005FLOFL4 Chi Marathon]]) and I really think I'm going to at least cook up this vegan chili he writes about.<br /><br />Regarding the vegan recipes. It should be obvious from the title, but it didn't really hit me until a few chapters in. A major theme in this book seems to be one of connecting a vegan diet with improving one's endurance potential. I would leave that to each individual reader's opinion, but for me it is motivating me to (again) go back to something I was doing 15 years ago.<br /><br />Well, I'm still only partly through the book, it's raining and 40 degrees outside. Something tells me that if I were Scott Jurek I'd be out there running, but I really want to see what else happens in this book!g and 40 degrees outside. Something tells me that if I were Scott Jurek I'd be out there running, but I really want to see what else happens in this book!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I received my Kindle before Christmas. I'm cheap and really do not like to buy books unless they are discounted but I read the reviews for Gone Girl and wanted to splurge. I received an Amazon gift card for Christmas and was happy to use that toward the purchase of this book.<br /><br />I was really disappointed. I could not get engrossed in the book at all and completely hated the ending. I was left feeling, \\"That's it??\\"  It's hard to express my opinion anymore without divulging specific information but my feelings are strong enough to post a review here, which I rarely do.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|This is a good story with good characters and great animations . If you have boys they will love this
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is one of the most creative works I've read. It was so imaginative, I couldn't put it down! Morgenstern creates a rich and unique reality that I found provocative and addictive.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|The beginning was slow, but I wanted to finish it because John Grisham is one of my favorite authors.  Sure enough, he did not disappoint.  Although the ending has you feeling sort of conflicted, nonetheless, still a great read.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Took me back to sitting in the theatre and watching this amazing play. This is a beautiful DVD. It is an amazing value.
B009O07NDY|5.0|Love the music! I saw the movie opening weekend and loved the music.  Saw this online and the CD package is great.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|So I received this in the mail sooner than even I anticipated since I got the free shipping for orders $25 or over, and immediately opened it up. First, it came in an Eco friendly box which is awesome that they choose to use recycled boxes. Then I opened it up and was very happy to see that the Purple color wasn't bright and hideous (like I sort of assumed it might be) so that was a plus. It was easy to get my Kindle Fire HD snapped in there and I feel like its going to keep it very safe. The swivel works great, I love that it turns it on when you open it and it puts it to sleep when you close it. Definitely saves on battery life. And I absolutely love the fact that it can be propped up standing up or standing wide. I would recommend this for sure, you definitely get your money's worth!
B00000ITOY|5.0|My daughter goes to a montessori pre-school and we love that Plan Toys makes good quality developmental toys that without plastic or paints.  My daughter loves these and one of her favorite games is making &#34;sandwiches&#34; with the shapes, so we can order different colors or shapes of sandwiches with our imaginary tea.  Solidly build and gets pretty regular play time from the 2 yr old.
B004RGHWIQ|5.0|This review is for the Blu-ray 3-D version (not the anaglyph, not the regular DVD) of Coraline.  For whatever reason, Amazon lumps all the reviews on a given movie together.<br /><br />I wasn't sure about Coraline.  I'm a 40 year old guy with a big Samsung 3-D TV and a surround setup, and I love a good movie as much as the next guy, but when a friend insisted that this was the movie she wanted to see, I was a bit taken aback.  Coraline?  What's it about?  Could I get into it?  Is it another in a long line of these totally CG movies like \\"Shrek\\" and \\"Cars\\"?<br /><br />Turns out the answers are yes, anyone could get into it; and no, it's not just another Pixar/Disney/RenderMan product.  Coraline is a partly CG, but mostly stop-motion feature film, with real puppets (Coraline herself had \\"hundreds of heads,\\" I am informed, and a special seamstress was employed to sew her tiny outfits.)  Stop motion is a tricky business at best and a crew of hundreds were employed for years to bring the awesome - and they succeeded.  As other reviewers have noted the film is a visual feast, and it displays a very personal, very idiosyncratic visual style which coheres through the whole film.<br /><br />Plot-wise, the film is very classic fantasy - reminded me of Pan's Labyrinth, just a little bit.  A young girl, depressed by her distant parents who are busy with troubles of their own, retreats into a fantasy world where things are not what they seem - and then things take a malignant turn.  No point in spoilering it - it's a classic plot and it's played out beautifully, the timing and the three-act structure are just superb.  If you are an adult who can stand a fairy tale - there is a talking cat - you will absolutely love it.  Despite the fairy-tale veneer, though, this is not for young children - no sex, but there is some real horror going on and I don't think I'd expose anyone much under the age of 12 to it, maybe a very resilient and worldly-wise 11 year old, but no younger.<br /><br />The 3-D is incredible - I am reviewing the HDMI 1.4a Blu-Ray 3-D, not the color-based anaglyph.  My TV does 240 Hz with active-shutter and I have never seen a better use of 3-D; it was like looking through a window into a real world, or a shadowbox at least - both I and my friend soon forgot we were even watching a 3-D movie, it was just a seamless part of the experience.  The voice acting, music, and surround sound were also technically and emotionally excellent, just examples of perfectly executed filmmaking at a very high level.<br /><br />I rarely say this, but I am quite certain I will watch this movie again and again and I will take great delight in showing it to friends.  If you have a 3-D TV and have any interest at all in viewing this flick after this review, the best thing you can do is stop reading and go click 'Buy It Now'.  You are going to love it.
B009HELT3C|5.0|This is definitely an exception to the notion that sequels get progressively worse. This one is great! We saw it on our 70&#34; 2D screen, but it almost seemed like we were seeing it in 3D!
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|The Marware lightweight case does all that it says, so for that I will leave a pretty good review. The product is lightweight for sure, and it does feel pretty good at protecting the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed at first because the front flap felt so flimsy, but that's just how it is designed and is even somewhat decieveing: it feels super cheap, yet is actually very strong.<br /><br />The case fits the Kindle Fire perfectly, that's to be expected, and was pretty easy to put on.<br /><br />Basically, my only complaints are as follows:<br /><br />1) The \\"stand\\" doesn't work too great; because the front flap is so thin, and that is what acts as the stand, it doesn't stay in the \\"grove\\" very well, and is very easy to knock out of the flapped up position. You can pull the strap down or whatever to make it stronger, but I want something that stands up quick and easy. This leads me to my only other complaint:<br /><br />2) The strap. I didn't think much of it, and this is totally a preferential item, but my wife ordered a different case for the same price (actually is cheaper now, since Marware wants $30 now, totally not worth that much), that also included a stylus, but the nicer feature is that it also was a magnetic flap. For someone like me who constantly opens and closes his case, undoing and redoing the strap all the time is a little annoying. Still, the strap probably works slightly better if you take it to high-abuse areas, like shoving it in a bag perhaps, but in almost all other scenarios the magnet case is better. The only downside is it is slightly thicker and heavier, but also feels and looks more professional. She got this version I believe: [[ASIN:B0098F5Y68 Fintie Slim Fit Leather Case Auto Sleep/Wake for Kindle Fire HD 7-Inch Tablet - 2012 Model - Purple]]<br /><br />So in all, the case works, and is light-weight. If you plan on abusing the Kindle and tossing it around frequently where the cover flap could get knocked off, this is probably the version to go with. I will say it feels decent for the $15 I paid, but at almost double that cost currently I wouldn't say it's worth it. The leather ones by Fintie look, feel, and function a little better in my opinion.probably the version to go with. I will say it feels decent for the $15 I paid, but at almost double that cost currently I wouldn't say it's worth it.

B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game is easy enough for my 5 and  8 year olds to enjoy and clever enough to challenge adults.  Get it. You won't be disappointed.
B004G600A4|5.0|It was a very good deal on this movie and a big success with my granddaughter, she loved it and has watched several times over.  I would recommend this movie for a little girl.
B007MDB548|5.0|CUTEST MOVIE EVER. MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT. SHE CANT TAKE HER EYES OFF THE TV WHILE WATCHING LIYYLE TINKER BELL
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is a must read. The things that Katniss had to go through. And what Peeta has to do to get his life and love for Katniss. And then there is Gale fighting for the love that he can't have. It's a must read and you will like the outcome of the whole series.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|I work with active duty soldiers, MANY of whom are pilots who fly helicopters in very hostile territory and NO these soldiers are NOT happy that this information was made public.  I read 4 chapters and it made me sick to my stomach that this information was written.
B0072PUC7W|4.0|Every year for the last 4 years I've purchased Armin's CDs. It's one of those things that you initially don't like but the more you listen to it, the more I like it. I've known that to happen more than one, that is why I keep buying his CDs.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I played this version on my pc before it was let out as a downloadable, and it was great. On the Kindle, it is just a great game. You can still buy some add-on's if you have some cash laying around, but there are still was that you can upgrade things by just playing some levels. Achievements, coins, MM, and more. This game is just plain awesome.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|See this movie. It is unique. Lots of action. Definitely worth the time. Different idea on a familiar theme. Give it a see
B005LBN7WQ|5.0|Similar to the 3 Tenors - I love this CD and love this group!!!  I wish they would put out another CD!  I think they are no longer together???  A shame, and life goes on!!  Awesome group!
B007UWBQEU|5.0|She is an awesome singer and there are multiple tracks on here that I love. So glad I got this one.
B00008BRBG|5.0|I like all of the albums by the Police.This is a classic.This being their first it was revolutionary,and  was the first to blend new wave with reggae.
B004EPYZZ8|4.0|A gift for my 11 year granddaughter who has a heart as big as Texas.  She loves this movie and had requested it as a gift.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|As a girl you can empathize with the emotions of Katniss, of her struggles of who to love, what her true feelings are...when she has never allowed herself these feelings before because her sole purpose in life was survival.
B00A17AD36|5.0|Simply Amazing!!! Love him! He is extremely talented. Listen to the words and it will blow your mind. His music is poetic and hits home for many. So many people told me to get it and when I went to the store, it was sold out! So I bought it for my Kindle Fire and it stays on repeat. It was even on sale, but I would have bought it for full price. Love the CD
B0070YDOT8|4.0|Big Fish Casino !Love to play this game. Great graphics and an excellent choice to pass some time. This app has all of the fun casino games.
1932100660|5.0|This book serves as a concise presentation of an expansive study and subject. It is beatuifully written and is highly digestible in terms of the way the information is organized and delivered. Beautifully written. Dr. Campbell is sincere and factual. I am greatly informed.  His years of experiences and education and his willingness to share are of benifit to all who comprehend.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|INTERESTING BOOK THAT WAS READ BY MY BOOK CLUB. IT RAISED LOTS OF QUESTIONS IN OUR DISCUSSION. THE ENDING WAS SOMEWHAT SURPRISING.
B004QX07G4|3.0|There were a few goods jokes that made me laugh so hard my husband had to elbow me and tell me to go to sleep! Otherwise, this book was kind of pointless.  Just a million random thoughts and strange stories all mushed together in one book.  Thankfully, it was free!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I cannot rate the movie itself because we could never get it to play. I didn't see a way to return it or get reimbursed for it either.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|I have yet to watch it , but the important thing is it was delivered in a timely manner and in fine condition; which is all I ask. I Thank you for your expedience.
0684803356|5.0|I had not read Hemingway since I was a kid, what a great story!  Reading this was like having a movie play in my mind. The imagery was amazing!  Highly recommend!
B005LAIHY0|4.0|he asked for it & liked it, but was disappointed there's no directors edition. he's happy with it though, so i am happy .
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I gave this case to my grandaughter for Christmas which was last week.  It was rippled on the front screen from the very beginning.  When you had a call activated and were ready to hang up and touched &#34;end&#34; on the screen it often would not hang up until we took the case off and ended the call.  Now it has broken on the side.  This case was not at all what we were expecting for a so called &#34;lifeproof&#34; case.  Disappointed
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Very good book and fast paced action with midevil awesomeness and great character choices and awesome swords and bows.<br /><br />  SAM BENOIST
0743297334|5.0|I had not read Hemingway since I was a kid, what a great story!  Reading this was like having a movie play in my mind. The imagery was amazing!  Highly recommend!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this game; I couldn't put it down. Normally, I skip cut scenes &amp; just play the puzzles but I actually watched every movie. I felt like the puzzles gave me a bit of a challenge and surprisingly I liked that it wasn't all hidden object puzzles.<br /><br />My only complaint, occasionally the keyboard would pop up on my screen and give me a challenge to close it. Fix that and its 5 star all the way.<br /><br />Great game! I'll be trying more of their games in the future. Ps I also dig the $2.99 price point.
B009R8DJ72|5.0|I choose the rating of 5 stars because I loved the book the story is about a boy named Greg Heffly and his trouble of finding a date to his school Valentine day dance I really enjoyed the book and I'm sure you will too! The book is written by Jeff Kinney I would recommend it to children between the ages of 7-12 :-).
B004SOR4H6|3.0|The app works just like the app for other devices but there is no way to enable mobile notifications. Would get better ratings if this was included.
B009CPEOC4|3.0|It was interesting to see the behind the scenes and to listen to the live performances! It was pretty good and worth seeing on cable!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Don't have Showtime.  DVD was very good. Storyline is geat. Loved watching it one disc after another. Have all ready got season two on preorder!
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|a great new / old tradition for families.  old story told and portrayed in a great way that anyone can enjoy
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love this game! This is the first one I've ever played where you draw the characters and the weapons/tools and I think the whole concept is pretty cool. The puzzles are challenging enough not to be dull, but not so hard that the average person wouldn't be able to solve them. Only downside, I think I'm already getting to the end. Hope they make new levels with each update!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|This was completely amazing -- I adored every second! Definitely better than the 2004 film, by far! If you're a Phan, this is a must have. :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I thought this series would be snobby, that I wouldn't relate, that it would be too stiff. I couldn't be more incorrect. Over the holidays, i downloaded the first episode of the first year, and the minute I finished that, I downloaded the remainder of the season and then season two! This historical fiction is beautiful, it is gorgeous, and I cannot wait for each new episode!
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|knew it was a great movie before and watching it on blu ray just adds too it even more.  excellent
B0015XASFS|5.0|I love Josh Groban's music! This dvd is a great experience and a chance to feel what his concerts must be like.(have never been able to attend one) He usually performs in very large venues, so this dvd gives you such a great up close view of his performance. Josh is incredible. He is so &#34;at home&#34; with the audience and he makes it feel like it is a small intimate performance. His band is great, as well as the amazing cellist and violinist and the additional orchestra featured at this Salt Lake City concert.  Josh's singing resonates in your soul! He has a way of transporting you and lifting you up with his music, so that you  forget all the daily trials of life! There are two parts to this concert and as Josh returns for part 2, he makes his way all the way through the venue from one end to the other, singing and shaking hands with literally a hundred fans!<br />The sound, photography, editing, etc. are all outstanding. But it is Josh Groban who literally shines as the amazing performer and wonderful human being that he is. This is well worth the price!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I'm glad I didn't see it in the theatre, but it's worth skipping the trip to Redbox to watch it on Amazon.
B00AJRQLTI|1.0|Where is it?<br />Red and black song. It is very meaningful song.<br />Simply missing is big mistakes here. Hope to have this one too
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|LOVED this game it is the best and most intriguing of the match three games I have played!<br /> The combination of history and game is great.
B00092ZL80|4.0|This is a great concert and a chance to relive the great 70's and 80's with these two supergroups. It is really long! Both groups play together first, then EWF do their set, followed by Chicago, and finally they are together again for the fantastic finish.<br />Chicago, of course cannot play all their hits, but the ones chosen were all really enjoyable. I have seen them in concert twice and they put on an amazing show! Never saw EWF in concert but have many of their albums, so seeing them together was like one gigantic super affair of music, particularly each of their brass sections.<br />This is a great concert and worth every penny. Our generation really made the best music! (IMHO)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book! Can't wait to start the next one. :) I loved it as much as twilight books.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The Hunger Games series was wonderful! Each book was very suspenseful and keeps you on your toes. It keeps the imagination going.
0307716511|4.0|I love love love when I read a book and think &#34;I did not see that coming&#34; and &#34;Sister&#34; definitely kept me on my toes.  If you liked &#34;Gone Girl&#34; this is an epicly good follow-up to quench that mystery thirst.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have used yahoo for years and have always been pleased with the service. Yahoo mail is easy to use and fills all of the needs for all ages.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Good movie. Nothing else to say. Don't stream though, even on a 30mp connection to an Xbox it is really poor quality.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This was one of the best Michael Connelly books I've read . Plenty of plot twists.  I was sad to see it end . My only complaint is that the book ended too quickly . But that's a minor criticism .
B0089AD8IO|1.0|I tried.  I really tried.  I want to be in on the cultural phenomena, but this was mind-bendingly bad.  I mean, sure it's old, but the writing, the acting, all of it was just so bad.
0439023491|5.0|I absolutely love this series!  If you haven't read it yet, but the books!  Just be sure to buy all three at once as you'll be able to finish it in a few days!
0141192410|5.0|Great book - I got this for my friend as part of a thank you gift for helping out with my wedding and she loved it! The book was in great shape and the seller's description was accurate.
B000Q7ZO8U|1.0|won't play in my blu-ray player, other blu ray disc play, but i can't get that one to play, so you tell me
1594203334|5.0|I just meant to read this for fun, but it has become my parenting bible.  Seriously, as someone about to give birth I have read EVERYTHING on how to be a modern, deliberate parent.  I want a child I can take to restaurants, I want a child who won't fight me on each bite of food, I want a child who knows not to interrupt me when I'm speaking to another adult and this book touched on the things I want in order to keep my life less hectic and make my children respectable young humans.  Of course, it's all in the practice right?  But I feel like this is the only book I read in all my research that gave me answers to behavioral questions I actually cared about.  Thank you Pamela.  Thank you.
0439023521|5.0|This is a great series.  Highly recommended!  There are 3 books to the series, so you'll have to buy all 3.  I just bought one and wish I had them all to read in row!
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Despite it's short length, Sanderson does an excellent job starting and completing a fascinating story.  There is enough background information to understand the setting and how this world works, without bogging down the overall story.<br />The concept is unique and while reading you *don't* get the sense that you've read it before.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I just started the game and I am really enjoying it so far.  Hopefully it doesn't disappoint, crossing my fingers.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved the TV series and was glued to the TV.  I can not wait until Season 3 comes out on TV.You will get so caught up in the plots, costumes, hair styles, the house, etc.  This is so great, makes you want to be back in that era.  My only suggestion would be to buy the DVD set and not stream-line it.
B003EY9UZU|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies, and Woody Harrison steals the show.  Now that 2012 is over, we can all watch this and still sleep a bit better at night.  Great CGI!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|With Evernote I've been putting through its paces these past few days. Web clipper has made it significantly easier to organize my notebooks and thoughts. Springpad another app similar to evernote is great but if you like sparkles and shiny things Evernotes user interface is better on the eyes and it just seems as a whole much more fun overall.
B002BWP49C|5.0|These are great with 2 DVD's gave as gift to little brother, he really liked, is 18 years old and a big fan.
B002DQLGHU|4.0|Our 10 year old grandson was visiting through the new year and wanted to do a movie marathon.  We had never seen the Harry Potter movies before, so we got them all lined up.  This was a good choice: it kept his attention, and there was plenty of action/suspense.  Even as adults, we were hanging in there! There were good lessons to be learned from the movie about truthfulness, the value of each individual and right from wrong.  We've headed well into the series.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|People that I either have done, will do or want to do business with.  Great resource of information and support.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Will miss Larsson...all his books were engaging.  This one was the best.  you can see how he grew as a writer
B008Z9L94O|5.0|Awesome artwork, awesome packaging, durable vinyl that sounds incredible. After chasing an original for years and never finding a price below $200 this better than the original box set is my new favorite in my vinyl collection. My cd was scratched years ago and I hate buying digital music. Although SP released some really nice HD version of this album. One day when I have an HD audio system maybe I'll buy them.
0871404133|3.0|Given the controversy the paper by Nowak et al. generated, I expected this book to help understand the arguments that Wilson and Nowak put forward (against kin selection) by extending their reasoning. Sadly, the book did not come very close to explaining them, beyond to say that mathematically those arguments are true and make perfect sense. Nevertheless, it is a fascinating read that provides an insight into the mind of one of the greatest biologists today. As a piece of scientific history this book and the many reviews in the peer-reviewed literature and the popular press (mostly damning ones) provide a unique perspective of the evolution of scientific thinking. Whether or not you agree with Wilson's new ideas, it's worth a read, if only to leave you slightly frustrated and puzzled by it all.  You would need a lot of background reading beyond what you would find in this book - to fully appreciate the scale of the scientific controversy stirred by this work and hopefully to have a more objective evaluation of its content.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|My husband is a HUGE fan of this HBO series.  As soon as the next season is available for purchase, we will buy it!
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|You're reading these reviews because you're unsure you want to see this, read no further. It sucked. The other ones were good this one totally sucked. I was really surprised, I thought maybe I'd be underwhelmed but it was worse. Bad story, no character development, the logic even within the world of superhero movies is pushed too far. I was just pissed. Anne Hathaway was very sexy, I think she's very pretty but rarely a sexy character. If you want to spend 2:45 minutes watching her dressed like the girl in the T-Mobile commercial and being a fox then you might like this.<br /><br />Bye
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I watched this movie on New Year's Eve with a friend, and was extremely pleased.  It was funny, musical, and touching.  I enjoyed the characters, and while the love story was a little dry, it was still a very cute movie.  I would definitely watch it again.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|This is a must watch for me every year around Christmas. This was  a gold box special and I could not pass it up!
B004K9A1XI|5.0|I purchased it as a Christmas present for my teenage daughter and she was thrilled with it.  CD's froom this artist are hard to find and it was great to find on here.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|User friendly. Easy to read in all kinds of light. love the audible addition- makes &quot;reading&quot;the Bible so much easier to navigate.
B003UESJIS|5.0|A warm, touching,  sad, and funny movie.  One of best I've seen over the last couple of years.  I love good British movies like this one.  You can't go wring with this one.
0810989956|5.0|Not this book my grandson loves it. And it helped with giving him ideas for his on Diary which I got him for Christmas.
B008QPCCQQ|4.0|I love having all Louisa's works in one book. So much fun re-reading these classics that I first read as a child.
B000SGRONM|1.0|I downloaded this book from the library onto my kindle.  I pretty much read anything but I could NOT even get through the first story.  I don't know who proofread the kindle edition but I found words repeating and then sentences dropping off not making any sense.  If I could give it zero stars, I would.  I had no expectations since I have not read from this author before so I guess I wasn't as disappointed as most.  I never even got to the baby killing I see people reviewing about.  Thank God for that.
B008J05EL8|2.0|I only purchased it because you made me pay for it.  It should go along with OfficeSuite Pro 6 that I purchased for $14.99.  I'm not even sure how to access or use it ....still trying to use the software itself.
B007SY3CEW|4.0|Great way to learn a little about piano, although let's face it - this won't prepare you for the real thing, but it is a lot of fun anyway and you really are playing part of these songs. The only hitch is when it comes to 3 key chords, my kindle can't interpret three keys at the same time. Maybe this doesn't have issue with other devices, but in the more complex songs it does slow me down and add a bit of frustration. That being my only criticism, this is a great app for under $3. There is a free version if you want a sample, but it only has a few songs-- the really cool ones are on the full version, well worth a couple bucks. I don't think you can beat it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Not the ending I thought it would be but definitely great. Happy hunger games! May the odds be ever in your favor!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It makes me think and use strategies that I haven't used since taking geometry forty years ago.<br />I am using it to keep my brain flexable. I usually don't like to play video games but I see the benefit in playing this one.
B0014KFV6I|4.0|This was a favorite of mine in the &#34;60's when I was playing guitar and in a small folk group.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Because the actors actually sang live, the soundtrack couldn't be any better. &#34;On my Own&#34; is definitely my favorite. Five stars!
B008NW67E0|4.0|The DVD is great! I don' know where my DVD was sent from but it took forever and much longer than quoted.
B002GNDXY4|3.0|With all the hype this show has received, I was disappointed with the quality writing, characters, and directing.  Enough with the close ups for effect.  Find some other way to insinuate mystery or fear.  The plot appears driven more by considerations of making you want to watch the next episode than telling a good story, so we're shown hints, or teases, but the story never arrives.  And can we get away from the all-American stereotypes and show some folks like we all actually knew in high school?
B007J4T2G8|4.0|wowie.  I could not stop reading.  bought the 2nd and 3rd book immediately. Wish i read it 30 years ago.<br />book is one dimensional - not much of a plot but I couldnt put it down.
B00069YDXU|5.0|This is an amazing live show. You won't be disappointed if you're an ELP fan. The sound and video are well performed and edited well.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Unexpected twists and turns make it a fun, enjoyable ride.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt is barely recognizable in a markedly different role from his other films like Inception). Would definitely recommend watching this movie.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I can't even call the attempt at humor juvenile because I'd worry about a juvenile relative who thought this was a good movie.  If Charlie Sheen is your moral compass - go for it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Love and forgiveness.in this life  and after that  is the message<br />..this book renews faith or will guide a person without it to  at least ponder it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|First of all,  I would like to address a few reasons for which some have claimed to dislike this book. Some say that it does not accurately portray highschoolers. Being a highschooler myself,  I can confidently disagree with this accusation. Alongside of that accusation,  some claim that the characters are unrealistic. I also disagree with this. I attend high school and am exposed to many different kinds of people. I have been able to identify with many of the characters and can see many of my friends or acquaintances in their roles. Many do not agree with the topics that the novel addresses such as drug abuse or abortion. The harsh truth is these are all realistic issues in the world today and it is impossible to write about a public high school without acknoweledging these things. I appreciate the author for writing realistically instead of averting situations.<br />  I was and still am blown away by this book. It is easily the best book that I have ever read. The literary style of Stephen Chbosky is quite genious. He very intelligently is able to write from the perspective of a socailly incapable fifteen year old boy. The perspective of the protagonist, Charlie, brings a very fresh, new, innocent, and highly interesting view of high school and modern teenagers. Chbosky also incorporates many ambiguous situations that create suspense and excitement for the reader.<br />  This book is first and foremost about culture. More specifically,  it is about the culture of teenagers living in 1991. It is a realistic book that addresses real topics. It introduces you to an array of hilarious and inspiring characters that pull you into the book.<br />  Overall it was an amazing book that made me cry my eyes out and laugh hysterically at the same time. I couldn't put it down and felt to read it a second time immediately after finishing it. It is well worth buying.<br />Congratulations,  Steven Chbosky. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is an amazing novel that keeps readers turning pages.
B000LGZHDS|1.0|I bought this because my 5 year-old loves Spongebob. Gary is soooooooo small and he just sits there. I do not rec this toy. If it were $1 I would say buy it. But all your child will do is just throw this in the corner and let it collect dust.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Great book, I decided to reread several classic books that I read as a kid/young adult and this was one on the list.  Once again, it didn't disappoint.
B008J2GAKU|5.0|Love this Volume. Love the Kindle touch to it. Gonna get Nightwing next cause I heard it intertwines w/ each other. Great read and very entertaining.
B000MNP2K8|4.0|It had no problem playing, so that's a thumbs up for me and it is definetly a plus :)<br />Thank you
B004U52VPS|1.0|I bought this game for my 5 year old for Christmas. He loves the angry birds game on my cell phone. However, he said this Angry Birds game is lame. and it truly is!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have been using this app for two years now and I love it specifically for the reading plans.  I still use a hardback Bible for church, but I love that I have this one on my phone and Kindle and can read whenever I have a few minutes.  I read through the entire Bible last year with the ESV plan and this year I've decided to do the chronological plan.  I really appreciate the daily reminders and the fact that it keeps track of my progress has been a great motivator.  I also love the fact that I can share an especially relevant verse or passage through social media and I can share updates on my reading plan progress so that my friends can hold me accountable.<br />I have had a few instances where it would force close on me or there was some sort of error and my plan wouldn't load, but those have been few and far between and haven't affected my reading too much, since it would usually resolve itself within a few minutes.<br />Overall, a GREAT tool for quiet times and a wonderful reading plan app.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Pretty fun, just very repetitive. Play it when you want to give your brain an exercise. Overall its cool when you're bored.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Fun, dark and an excellent performance by Johnny Depp! Fan of both Dark Shadows and Johnny Depp. I enjoyed the movie. Was dark enough to pay homage to the original show, but Johnny Depp brought his own flair to the character, which is almost always a good thing.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|The speed is fine, but it stops loading after a dozen posts or something, which is pretty annoying. Hope this will be fixed soon.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The Dark Knight Trilogy in its entire awesomeness on BD-ROM and it is great.  And if you have some free time Youtube Auralnauts Bane Outtakes it is hilarious.  How long to find market fresh strawberries?  8 minutes.  Let us go mobile.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|So, what's not to like? Really? I didn't think I'd like it, and was resistant to read it, based on what I thought the premise was, it was a cruel world and I didn't think I'd like to read about it, that is until I read Chapter One online at Amazon. I was hooked. I don't buy a lot of e books, but this is one I'm happy to own.
B004EWGLKI|5.0|I found this is another laugh out loud book with appeal to a wide range of readers ranging from my super cool inner city hipster relatives to my fellow senior citizens. As a failed student of beginner Spanish and ex-teacher the descriptions of attempting to learn another language particularly hilarious.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Simple and easy to play. Good choice if you want to kill times with some brain teasing games. 4 stars instead of 5 because the ideas of the solutions repeat kinda too much.
B00004TS0E|5.0|I finally decided to own this movie so I would have it available every Christmas! It was shipped very fast!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I google everything.  I use it at least 5 times a day and it is most helpful.  I got my boss googling now too as well as my kids.  I can't remember what we did before Google came to our rescue.
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|As like all of the A.L.D. musicals this one is well worth adding to my collection. It show what went on after the Phantom.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Yes, my 3-year old goes for it. This game needs a Kiddie level. She pulls the rubber the wrong way but that's part of the fun, too
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Even though they didn't stay more than five days for their Christmas visit this year, our 10 and 7 yr old grandchildren must have listened to this video five times.  They loved it!
B005HSL626|2.0|Boring. Nothing challenging about it. Its ok for a child or teenager, but not for a mom.  My daughter suggest it, but no thanks.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I can not say enough how much I enjoyed watching this DVD in &#34;BLU-RAY&#34; My Sony 52 inch HD TV really made this Musical exceptional.
B009GEOLM4|5.0|This was a Great Batman movie, this was a little dark compared to the actual show but that just shows a little more realism and makes it way better I think, waiting for part 2 to come out!
B0086213XW|1.0|If I could give the movie a (-) Star I would.  Gloomy, too much nudity and explicit sex.  Acting is terrible, too.  Don't waste your time or money :(
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I recommend this book.  Its an easy read, but not too exciting.  It was my first ready by Mira Lyn Kelly.
B002UEW31I|4.0|Loved it! Lots of action, blood, crude language, good performances and funny. But make sure you know what you're in store for...
B0097HSS4M|3.0|this product is not what I thought it would be I thought it would do more than it does because of other products I have seen
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I choose this rating because I really like this book!! This book help you to understand book one!! I recommend this book everyone who has read book one to read this one. I'm about to start book three! Will let y'all know what I think about that one.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Probably the funniest movie I've ever seen! Even my fiance agreed and he's not into musicals. We give it 4 enthusiastic thumbs up!! :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was nothing I expected it to be, I will own it and confessed that this book has me in tears. Colleen Hoover writing let's you experience the emotional feelings that Sky is going through.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|grandchildren loved it I read it to them Christmas Eve before bedtime and have rear it many more times and each time they love it
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Very happy with the service and the movie. Excellent. This was a gift for someone and he loves it very much!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Kimberly. I loved this book. It's a real page-turner.  I cannot wait to read the next two books.  So excited.
B009O2XY12|4.0|I'm not one for playing games on my kindle or my phone but my daughter downloaded this game onto my kindle and I actually keep going back to play some more!
B001HBYHFA|5.0|As satisfying as watching Firefly. Twists, turns, laughing, crying. I will watch it a million times. If you love Firefly you will love Serenity.
B007V65R54|5.0|everyone should read this book, but repubs would not believe it it turned out to be true.it turned out to
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Started with the free trial but it was well worth the $2.99 for the full version. Great graphics and some interesting mini-games. Will definitely recommend this game!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I made a mistake and rated the mobilebook ap for facebook instead of this one.  I actually deleted the mobilebook version as it wasn't what I wanted.  If you have internet access, its great to have the one-touch ap to facebook so you can check in from where ever you may be!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Hits so so so so addicting I love it I love it its so addicting it's so so so so so amazing
B0018QQQK8|5.0|It was a great love story. I loved the characters. I only wish that Nicholas Sparks would have spent a bit more time in the last chapter. A scene that was filled with so much action and anticipation ended so abruptly and we had to wait until the epilogue to see how it all turned out.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The blu ray of TDKT has been amazing! The color and picture have been outstanding. And of course the content of each movie is awesome!! Buy this trilogy!!! You won't regret it!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Since I'm on my Kindle a lot, this is a great way to check the weather from where ever you are!
0399160450|3.0|I love the Tom Clancy books.  This isn't really one.  The plot and interweaving story lines are great, but the writing, not so much.  Clancy's writing is elegant and tight and detailed; this isn't.  PLEASE--Don't use single sentences as whole paragraphs.  Don't start a sentence with \\"No\\".  Doesn't heighten the suspense at all.  And a little quibble--The parachute would be \\"taut\\", not \\"taught\\".  Who edited this?
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I chose four stars only because the beginning was a little slow. However, I very much enjoy every second of this book. I saw everything so clearly in my mind it was like I was watching a movie. The descriptions and obviously the author's choice in \\"flow\\" made me feel like I was walking and experiencing every sight, sound and smell of the circus. I found the different generations of characters interesting along with the love story.It was the perfect combination of drama, love, fluff, action and anger. Perfect! I could go on but you should read it instead.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|This dvd is excellent in quality.  The action seems non-stoppable.  Anyone who enjoys sci-fi, non  stop action and great special effects will enjoy this movie.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|&#34;The Art of Racing in the Rain&#34; is written through the eyes and thoughts of a dog but a very intelligent dog and not what you would expect. I have read hundreds of books and this book was a nice change from the thrillers and romance novels that pack the best seller lists. Chalked full of life lessons and little tidbits of great meaning, I'm sure to read this book again ( and I rarely reread a book!)
B007URVZJ6|3.0|This is a good book for the basics of publishing through KDP, but writers looking for more detailed information on layout, pricing etc will have to look elsewhere. Consider it a KDP manual.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I purchased this book because of the overwhelming high ratings and gushing customer reviews it received. Sad to say, I put it down half way through to start the second Hunger Games book..<br /><br />I just wasn't all that impressed; I feel even half way through the book nothing really happened. It was just like being in a room with a couple of first-love, hormone ridden teenagers, which is cute but...been there done that!<br /><br />Wish I had such a deep passion and love for this book as 90% of the reviewers on here have but, unfortunately, can't say it did anything for me.
B000K4X5XA|5.0|This is a great movie especially for Superman fans.  The qualiity is great and there is plenty of action and there is a story line.
B0053KWDES|3.0|not bad but I dont think it can make the sound better but it dose can make the sound lounder
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|While I understand some of the complaints others had with this movie I liked it and saw it as a fitting end to this batman.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Love this movie. So glad I ordered it. Is both Colorado and black and white editions. Haven't watched colorized yet but enjoyed the original version.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This CD has great quality and sound.  The songs are magnificent.  I strongly recommend this CD to all Susan Boyle lovers.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I'm sure fans of the Harry Potter books were put off by this tale of the citizens of a small town, but J.K. Rowling sure can draw you in and tell a great story. She has a way of making her characters real and human while at the same time weaving a magic web that gets you caught up in caring about what happens to them. Her use of dialect was spot-on...I could hear Krystal's voice in every line of her dialogue. The use of obscenities  and sexual situations definitely let you know that the author was distancing herself from her previous works, but at the same time they were necessary to the story line and did not feel like they were merely being used for shock value. Rowling takes a snapshot of modern life in a country town and shares with us the anger, hope, desperation, pain, fear and love that people experience and shows us once again, but differently, we are not alone. Excellent story. I hope she has more to share.
B005LAJ17M|2.0|Even the great performances, especially by  Mandy Patinkin and the ever-amazing Claire Danes, don't compensate for the rather mediocre scripts - mediocre as compared to something like The Wire or Breaking Bad.  In particular, the reason for turning into a terrorist was weak, and ultimately unbelievable. Not enough chills, spills and revelations.  Kind of disappointed with this series; especially considering the hype surrounding it.  Given up on Season 2.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed the book and would recommend it for anyone that likes suspense.  Very well written and it kept my interest. I couldn't put it down. When I finished I had to read the other two to find out how it ended. The only thing I didn't like was the fact it involved children.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Great quuality and special efects.  Sci-fi lovers will really like this movie. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes sci-fi movies.
B0006TSSNG|5.0|Incredible story, accurately presented, amazing attention to detail.  The packaging is also nice for storage and protection purposes.  Nice buy
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Intriguing book with a suspenseful story tale. Would advise anyone to read. First time reading a John Grisham book and recommend it to all novel readers.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I would and have recommended this CD to just about everyone.  I love Enya's voice; I find it very angelic and could listen to her all day.  I chose this CD as some Christmas to play for an elderly community that I work for and I felt the music would be well received by not only staff, but elders as well.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|It was a story that is a little bit far fetched none the less an interesting read  could have done better
0307895475|5.0|I got this for my teenage nephew, and he loved it!  He told me there were things in the book that he had not even seen on the Internet, when he was searching for cheats.
1439192812|5.0|After reading &#34;The Selfish Gene&#34; I picked up this hard cover book.  It's filled with pictures and illustrations all geared to enhance the writing which truly does show that reality is indeed more magical that fiction.  While adults can enjoy this book, I think its true audience is the 7th to 12th grade students.  If you have a child of your own, niece or nephew, or want to buy it now for a future grandchild, this makes a rewarding book that has the potential to open their eyes and set their life on a better course after one realizes that we don't need deities, gods, or the mystical to explain the unexplained -- science can explain it all without losing any of the magic that is the evolution of our universe.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I am thrilled with the Les Mis soundtrack. Saw the movie and felt like I was right back in the theater as I listened.
B00062PN6I|4.0|Cord is extra long, they are extremely comfortable to wear and the sound is great. Even though they are not &#34;noise canceling&#34;, they sure block out an awful lot of background noise when being worn.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|love this classic movie.  my kids like it too. great movie for entire family.  will be around for many years to come.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Doesn't sort by &#34;Most Recent&#34; properly, and when I viewed images it was very difficult to get back to the newsfeed. Will not use it on my kindle anymore. I will just wait to check my facebook from my home computer.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app. it it feels like I'm in a actuall world. I would buy this app if I were you.
B009GEEMLY|3.0|Not as good as I expected. Good for the kids, but not satisfying enough for adults. However, CGI was outstanding...
B0009ZHJ7S|2.0|this movie is okay, but I would not really recomend it for young children.  there are a few messages that young children might not understand.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm just downloading this game but my brother Eli had it first and he let me play it and it was realy cool if anyone puts a bad review THERE LIEING!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love these books but this one was short. It's was good tho I can see why he is third weel
0316069434|5.0|Connelly is one of the best in making interesting, plot provoking reading. Cant go wrong with Harry Bosch in the picture.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I've used evernote for a couple of years now and love it. Who knows, since I've sprung for a paid dropbox account, I may even do that here in the not distant future.
B0011TNVLY|5.0|Bought the movie for $9.99 price was a little iffy knowing that the dvd was in stores for $9.00 but its portable so my sister can watch the movie everywhere,anytime. fast download and overall impressed.
