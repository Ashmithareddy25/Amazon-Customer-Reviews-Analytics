B002HK9IDQ|5.0|We received this in a timely matter.  It is a gift, so they haven't watched it yet.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I loved the CD I think she will become even more famous. Wish she had done her own songs but I'm sure that will come later.  Good choice of songs.
B0013LL2Z2|4.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies, it was fun to buy on DVD and watch with my wife - who'd never seen it before. The copy we bought was good, the movie was in great condition, and the extra's were a lot of fun to watch. At this price, I was very happy with the purchase.    The movie itself is just as enjoyable now as it was years ago. Classic story, great FX, and good performances. Fun, sexy, sci-fi movie with the intriguing theme of a sealed world of pleasure and leisure ... but only room for the young. This movie has many classic lines and scenes, and a plot with multiple twists and surprises.    They just don't make sci-fi movies like this any more and it's more then worth seeing!
B002IR3PSC|5.0|If you are a Tull fan, this one is a must for you. This is vintage Tull at there best. I have seen this band live many times, and this is the second best presentation you will find after catching the live shows. This DVD represents Tull in their middle years, and, as such, you will witness their music at its best (most matured).
B00200K2UG|4.0|[[ASIN:B00200K2UG Tamrac 5613 Ultra Pro 13 Camera Bag (Black)]]  Excellent bag, well laid out and roomy. I'm very happy and enjoying using the bag and buying gadgets and photo stuff to fill it.
B00000IQV7|4.0|Patch Adams is a movie from the period of Robin Williams' life when all of his roles were inspiring.  One reviewer I've read said that he wanted to throw up when he thought about the Patch Adams period.  Others find these films to be an expression of a sincere desire of a man to be a better person.  I am in that group. There are few moments in this film where you receive a negative image of Hunter Adams (a real person being portrayed by Williams), I have to admit that.  I liked the symbolism of the butterfly that was used at the moment when he chose going on with life in spite of problems.  Some might find it excessive, though.  I thought it was a good understated connection with the earlier moment of confession about how his inamorata, a doctor who had always been chased for her beauty, had wanted to escape by becoming a caterpillar.  Overall, I kleenex-demanding movie with a positive message; not for those who want to balance good and bad sides of a character and make up their own minds.
B001OQCV24|3.0|I was so excited for this movie to come out after seeing the previews.  However, I was so disappointed!  The special effects are awesome but the story line is lacking.  John Cusack did a weak job with his character...not strong enough.  Some of the special effects are also overkill with several buildings collapsing one after another, yet the characters amazingly bypass every one of them while others are crushed.  Overall, I'll probably purchase the movie for the special effects, but certainly not the weak story line.
0340896965|5.0|A new David Nicholls book is a reason to get up in the morning!  I really loved One Day:  the concept, the writing style, the humor and the characters were pitch perfect.  Yes, it was a weeper but worth every moment spent with it.  Fans of his other books and authors like Nick Hornby and Chris Cleave (also wonderful) will enjoy this.
B000UP8FUM|5.0|A great book to read and arrived on time and in excellent shape. Thanks  Tom
1582701709|5.0|I read an article about this book in a doctors office and was intrigued and I had to purchase it. It was wonderful and has helped me to reshape my life. I am thankful I read it!
0786868724|5.0|I really, really enjoyed Have a Little Faith. Mitch Albom is an excellent writer and this book continued my appreciation of his storytelling. I particularly like his ability to delve into deep subject areas that make you really think while still keeping it light enough to be an uplifting experience. This will be one that I will definitely pass around - and then expect back so I can read it again.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|Our family enjoyed this miniseries. It gave my kids (8,12) a good feel for the early years of US history. The acting is terrific.
1400064287|3.0|This incredibly simple-minded book attempts to show how some ideas stand out while others don't by using amazingly dated examples that have been often repeated in other books.  Ronald Reagan, \\"Where's the Beef?,\\"  JFK, \\"New York, New York,\\" Disney World, Nora Ephron sitting at her typewriter--the examples are so old and tired.  This has a 2007 copyright?  It sounds like an 1980s' college thesis that has been freshened up for current publication.  The basic points are so overused by others that you will feel like you have read this book before.  If you have never read a basic business or communication book, then maybe this is a good summary of the rest.  But there is almost nothing original here and it's not written well enough to recommend. The authors seem to miss one of the major points to why ideas are easily recalled--they need to be somewhat current and relatable!
B001UV4XUG|5.0|All too often, a film that has a high degree of originality accomplishes that at the expense of its entertainment value.  This film is a striking exception.  It is original from beginning to end, and well deserves its substantial box office success.  Definitely recommended.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Update: both Michael C. Hall and John Lithgow won the Golden Globe for their performances this season. Michael C. Hall also won the Screen Actor's Guild Award.<br /><br />The success of this type of show, serial killer crime, is usually dependent on how good the villain is.  Dexter is, of course, semi villainous since he is a serial killer himself but he kills bad guys.  So the series needs a \\"real\\" bad guy as well.  John Lithgow is that bad guy this season and quite simply, you couldn't ask for a better one.  It is a very complex role of a supposedly ideal father, husband and dedicated volunteer for the homeless who also is the serial killer Trinity. He is a very nuanced and layered character.  These two characters are not the whole show but they firmly anchor it and everyone else revolves around them. There are surprising twists this season and none more so than the ending. But this is how Dexter always works as a tv show. All the other characters are quite good again too, especially Dexter's sister, who has a significant role in unmasking Trinity too.<br /><br />A note of warning: if you are also a reader and want to read the four Dexter novels, it is a somewhat bizarre experience to do it side by side with watching the tv show.  This is because the books and tv shows kill off and emphasize different characters.  Both are excellent but they are different.  Imagine Sherlock Holmes where Moriarty lives in the tv version but dies in the books and then change around Watson, Le Strade and the \\"The Woman\\", et al, and you begin to see the difficulty.  Dexter is also more villainous yet also more comic in the novels than in the tv show.<br /><br />Another added note: if you are an audiobook fan, the Dexter audiobooks are some of the very best audiobooks around.  The narrator is superb.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B000FA5TTW|5.0|I actually bought this book back when it first came out and i think it must have been around the early 2000's... I read it and thought ok a little weird. About 8 years later i picked it up and dusted it off thinking that I couldn't remember what it was about. Its a great book and I stayed up late to read it again. I still have the copy I bought all those years ago and when I saw that there will be a movie I was awed. I would say if you haven't read it yet then do so. The story is so touching and will make the hardest person think a little more about life and death.
1439157383|4.0|Read this book before seeing the movie.  I love the how the author writes each chapter from a different person's perspective - it really gives the story a complete feel.  The book is amazing and the story heart breaking.  I read it in 4 days.
0892818875|5.0|I have had this book for several years and refer to it often as my body chemistry and goals change.  The wisdom that the author has gained from years of experience and provides to his readers is amazing.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|This collection of songs displays clearly why this young Lady Gaga is an international phenom!Every song is bigger darker and more fun with gaga's twisted aesthetic which i personally can't get enough of. Go Lady gaga go!!
B000VBIGD6|5.0|I had purchased this movie many years ago when it first came out and thought it was absolutely hysterical.  Now, this many years later, in speaking with my sister about some \\"relatives\\" that she was having some concerns over, I snidely commented that her story reminded me of the Chevy Chase Movie, Christmas Vacation.  She either didn't remember this movie or actually had never seen it before so I immediately went to Amazon.com (which always has the best prices)and ordered one for her.    It arrived within a few days and the next phone call I received was the sound of my sister laughing hysterically as she thanked me for the great gift.  They plan to share it with several neighbors so I know this DVD will really be seen by many.  Good way to start laughter 'round the world.
0062511408|5.0|A friend suggested this book to me and I could not put it down.  It is my first book from Paulo Coelho.  Well written, interesting, learned a few things that I have put to practice, also helped me refresh my Spanish.

1433502399|4.0|The ESV Study Bible provides a lot of extra notes that help with understanding the text, the context of the writings and how they relate to certain events. The maps are clear, colorful and not overdone. If one were to study (eventually!) all of the material found in this Bible, and apply it to everyday living, spiritual growth would be remarkable. It better positions the reader to give help to others. It's like having good Bible school material in one volume.   [[ASIN:143350393X ESV Study Bible (TruTone, Forest/Tan, Trail Design)]]
B002H3F7F6|5.0|If you want to sumerge into a white deep forest, flow with the fallin snow of a silent winter, try again like Song of Labyrinth. Stings one more time brings to us a overwhelming job. A really masterpiece for this christmas.<br /><br />Take the journey too.
B001KZLN46|5.0|If you love Disturbed and other Heavy music groups Five Finger is a must have. Lyrics are awesome. Parental advisory for language well deserved. Not for prudes.
B001KVZ6G6|2.0|This is a review of the movie - not the dvd or the packaging like most other reviews.   The movie starts of very well - but once they house lands in the strange world of dogs and annoying road runner bird - it completely falls down.  the dogs are annoying - no humor - the bird is goofy.  I was very disappointed overall with the movie.   \\"maybe\\" worth watching once - but not a classic by any stretch of the imagination...
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle has a magnificent CD.  I hope she records more.  She has a amazing voice, and I think she could handle any kind of music.
B002NXSRX4|4.0|Really, this movie is pretty good is you're just looking for a couple hours of cheap entertainment (it helps if you're an 80's kid). Most of the people writing these reviews seem to get that. Is the writing/plot awful? God yes! The acting's downright cheesy 75% of the time and the CGI can be a little funky. That's part of what makes it good...in a \\"bad movie\\" kind of way. If you like watching things blow up, people shooting at each other, and ninja battles, you will be entertained.     If you're purposely looking for plot holes and glaring mistakes, of course you'll find them. IT'S GI JOE!!! What's wrong with you?! Oh no, the soldier's got facial hair. He didn't call the General \\"Sir\\" a couple of times. The Eiffel Tower didn't crumple the right way when it was hit by the missile.  NOBODY remakes eighties stuff anywhere near \\"true\\" to the original story. Seriously, Transformers, anything from Marvel. If this were really like the original GI Joe, they would have been firing laser guns at each other the whole time and nobody would have ever gotten hit. Then Sergeant Slaughter would have come up out of left field and told some boys playing basketball in 80's short-shorts \\"Don't Do Drugs\\". Would you really want to see that?    The moral of the story is don't think to hard when you're watching this and you'll enjoy it. I went into it thinking the same thing I thought as a kid: Snakes Eyes is bad@$$; How does Destro make faces if he's wearing a mask; and yelling \\"Yo, Joe!\\" is always awesome after a gun battle. If you're look for a true-to-life representation of military tactics, behavior, and dress code...you are definitely in the wrong place. I'm sure you can find a Patton documentary somewhere on Amazon.

B001C4CI8U|5.0|Started watching this series after missing several episodes. Now more events and conversations make sense.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Surprises.  It has plenty.  Great Acting Galore.  Chris Pine kills.  Story is original, though they had to stretch a few things with the time travel/transporter things, but it works.  I have seen this movie twice in theatres, once on a cruise and twice since I bought it.  I love it.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|It is just the thing for the Nikon DSLR. So much better than the SB800. This item is a must have for all camera owners.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Nicely done twist that satisfies old trekies like myself and enables new trekie fans to continue the journey. Wonderful casting, visual effects, sound and storyline. Can't say anything bad about this movie.
B000062XE1|5.0|I just love this set of videos..I am a major \\"British\\" movie fan..there just seems to be such a difference in the quality of work done by the british than we seem to do here in America..and I do love \\"words\\" and the british seem to use them so very well..I love the humor of Oscar Wilde..and all of these are such classics   I have enjoyed every one of them..and to see some of the stars in their \\"younger days\\" is great...you just can't miss on a \\"Classic\\" set like this one. I hope you enjoy them too..
B0012GMYUU|4.0|Jeff Beck is amazing, no matter which incarnation of his playing you listen to, and this CD, You Had It Coming, is one of his best.  Jeff does a great job of staying relevant in a changing music world.  This CD shows a lot of creativity as well as guitar prowess.
B00004ZBVG|1.0|This movie based on the book of the same name (Bat 21), written by William C. Anderson, is the most contemptable collection of lies and bullcrap ever written about a Search and Rescue mission, developed, conducted and flown by the 1st USAF Special Operations Squadron (Douglas A-1 Skyraider...Call Signs: Sandy and Hobo). I was a USAF combat pilot assigned to both the 1st SOS and the 56th Combat Operations Wing at Nakom Phanom Thai Air Force Base during the period of this rescue. The movie and book is nothing more than a total distortion of the events, including the fictitous Birddog pilot, all done for the sake of greed and pure commercialism on the part of the author. The Bat 21 (EB-66 navigator) rescue mission, which in fact was a dual rescue, concurrent with Nail 38 (OV-10 pilot), shot down in the same area, at the same time, was one the most brilliantly conceived, heroic and unselfish Search and Rescue missions flown in the Vietnam War. So twisted and distorted is the movie, when compared to the truth, that is is scorned and reviled by almost every A-1 Skyraider pilot, and Jolly Green helicopter pilot who flew and sacrificed their lives (Jolly Green 67...5 KIA) on this SAR mission, for eight continuous days. Also deleted from the true story were the US Army RECONDO unit. It would almost take another book to tell the true story, compared to the manufactured fiction writen by the author.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|Ridiculous plot aside, my main gripe with this dvd is the boosted background audio. The dialog is almost entirely drowned out by explosions and \\"riveting\\" music; so much so that it's nearly impossible to follow the story.
1416594787|5.0|I've been mulling over this issue since I was a teenager, and Richard Dawkins has laid it out to me plain as day like previous authors could not. He takes the issues such as morphology, the age of the earth (very important to understand the concept of self-replicating molecules becoming mammals), experiments that DO actually show evolution, and modern examples of it actually happening in nature, to put together the puzzle that those of us who were raised as creationists can understand (my dad read bible stories to me starting at two years old; my aunt introduced my to ID circa 1996/97 with an analogy comparing a human brain to a computer, both of which show \\"evidence\\" of design, way before it made its way to court cases).<br /><br />This won't persuade hardcore creationists who view Charles Darwin's writings as a threat to their worldview and faith, but this, along with Jerry Coyne's Why Evolution is True, will give the layman a firm enough understanding of natural selection and descent with modification. Granted, I am not of a fundamentalist* persuasion, and when I was 5 or 6 simultaneously held the view that dinosaurs did die out 65 MYA AND that God created Adam and Eve, so obviously I have a different reaction than someone else of a different background, but I do encourage fundamentalists to read this and Jerry Coyne's book to, at the very least, read the \\"other side\\".<br /><br />*I use \\"fundamentalist\\" in the traditional sense, that being of the bible-believing Christians who rejected modernity, situational ethics, moral relativism, the mainline churches' converns over \\"social justice\\" and unions than the cross of Christ, and modern interpretations of the bible, and do not mean it pejoratively.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|Alicia Keys is arguably the biggest solo R&B act of the decade having burst onto the scene in 2000 with her stunning single \\"Falling\\" that captured the hearts of the masses.  Nine years later, after more than a few grammy nods, critcally acclaimed albums and tours, the piano playing phenom has once again redefined her sound with her new album.      The Element of Freedom is something that I certainly was not expecting from Alicia Keys.  This album is alive, it's ambitious, it's edgy.  She experiments with some different sounds than on her previous albums but still all blends together perfectly.  Some artists get better with time and I believe Alicia Keys is one of them.  I believe this album is her best effort of her 4 albums (Songs In a Minor, Diary of Alicia Keys, Unplugged, and As I Am) after repeated listen. Her voice sounds a bit stronger on this album than previous efforts but still as sweet as ever.  The vocals definitely shine on the album.  Her piano skills are also undeniable as well as the overall production.  The songwriting is also excellent.    It's not often that all of an artist's releases are excellent but when talking about Alicia Keys that seems to be the case.  The Element of Freedom is another \\"notch in the belt\\" for her as I can seem to find any monumental failures or vast deviations from what made her successful in the first place.  While every song is not a masterpiece (the Beyonce collaboration was a disaster and perhaps the only glaring weakness on the album...) there's plenty here to like and love such as DISTANCE & TIME, HOW IT FEELS TO FLY, DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING, TRY SLEEPING WITH A BROKEN HEART, THAT'S HOW STRONG MY LOVE IS, LOVE IS BLIND, AND UNTHINKABLE amongst others.  I do believe the album to be a bit more mellow than previous efforts but still excellent.  Fans of Alicia Keys will definitely enjoy this album.  5 stars and highly recommended.      *There's many different versions of the album.  The Empire Edition has a couple bonustracks ALMOST THERE & LOVER MAN. There's another deluxe edition which contains the extra tracks THROUGH IT ALL & PRAY FOR FORGIVENESS, the itunes bonus track is STOLEN MOMENTS but you can only get that if you pre-ordered it from there, and yet another version includes a DVD of an Intimate Studio Performance.  When artists (or the labels) do this I say just buy a copy and get the rest of the bonus material for free99 from the world wide web.  That don't make any sense to have so many different versions of an album!*
B001PPGAIA|5.0|Well-acted movie, somewhat reminiscent of \\"How the West Was Won\\" in scope, but shorter time-scale, of course.
B001AVCFK6|3.0|The movie was great. I didn't need all the extras.  Would have liked just the movie.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|The second season was more action packed than the first season - I felt. After the demons are released we see the brothers taking on more forces of evil than the first one.<br /><br />The action is more intense, the circumstances greater, and the stakes are higher as the world now hangs on the balance of the invasion from hell. The Yellow Eyed demon is on a mission to unleash the forces of hell onto Earth and the two brothers have to try and stop him from doing this.<br /><br />Along the way they run into some new friends that help them in their quest to stop this demon. Also we find out that Sam has some powers that get stronger in the later seasons.<br /><br />The first one was an introduction of the two brothers (and their background) and their mission and the second season is them trying to stop a greater evil. Definitely better than the first season and a great watch for suspens/action lovers.
0525421033|2.0|I really wanted to like this book - it had great reviews and it seemed like the type of story that I could easily fall in love with.  But it wasn't.  I would have enjoyed it more if the author would have really made the reader fall in love with the main character before the auto accident.  It lacked emotion...it lacked heart.  There was too much jumping to/from the past/present, which I realize is necessary at times, but one thing I've learned in writing is that flashbacks STOP the action. Any time the book was getting good...BAM STOP...unnecessary flashback. The back story often flashed back to MORE back story...and it wasn't even that important to know at times.  An example would be when the author flashes back to a time mom/daughter stopped at a casino and thought they were only there for minutes, but it had been hours, and then jumping to present time relating the casino experience to how time seems to stand still in the ICU. That right there is a perfect example of unnecessary back story.  Also, anything that included too many details about people who were NOT important characters (Henry and Willow). Too much back story, not enough present time action and emotion to make the reader fall in love with the main character.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|If you look at the DVD cover, it pretty much tells you what the season will be about. Dean does not have much time on Earth as he has a year left before the crossroads demon comes to collect on his soul for hell and Sam is on a mission to find some way to keep Dean alive.<br /><br />This is a season where you see both the brothers' relationship take a deeper turn, as you see Dean living it up knowing that his last days on Earth are near, but at the same time making sure that his little brother is alive and well after he leaves, and Sam trying to find some way to keep his brother alive, knowing well the risks involved.<br /><br />There is more brotherly drama in this season, and it is interesting to see how the two actors try to reconcile there differences before Dean goes to hell, but at the same time express there love for one another knowing well what is ahead.<br /><br />Very good acting and even better story-telling. I recommend it!
0439023491|4.0|Although still a book worth reading, especially as a sequel, it's lacking much of what made the first book, The Hunger Games, so powerful and compelling. Throughout most of the read, I found myself wondering why The Hunger Games needed a sequel in much of the same way that I found myself hating the fact that there were follow up films to The Matrix.<br /><br />Comparably, The Matrix is a film that is unique, philosophically moving, and creates an incredible experience that sits with you like few films have the capacity of doing. The Hunger Games was the same for me as a book. It's a potent reminder of what our future could be if we continue to go down the path of rampant voyeurism as entertainment, and a government that oppresses people for the sake of maintaining its authority. This second book, while still certainly entertaining, lacks much of the quality of writing and the social commentary that the first one exhibits.<br /><br />Lindsey Miller, [...]
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Of all the seasons, I would have to say that this is the most poignant one. With Dean dealing with the horrendous circumstances he faced in hell and the new responsibilities that Sam feels he is responsible for, the story becomes a roller coaster ride of emotions.<br /><br />Many times you will see the brothers caught between their emotional inclinations as well as their duty to save people from demons, vampires, and all the other forces that go bump in the night.<br /><br />There is still plenty of action in this season, but what makes this season really interesting is the more complicated acting that both Jared and Jensen give to tell their troubled situations.<br /><br />There are definitely more times that the brothers break down during this season, so if you don't like seeing men cry on screen, this might not be for you, but I felt that the actors were playing out the roles as competently as possible given the situations they were in.<br /><br />If anything this was a season more focused on story-telling and emotional drama compared to the other seasons.
B001KVZ6FW|2.0|I sent the DVD to my 4 and 8-year-old grandchildren after seeing the film aboard a flight. Simultaneously, my daughter showed them the movie (from Netflix). The little one got very upset at some parts, e.g., where the bird was imprisoned and when the wife died. The older one watched but didn't get involved.  She returned the DVD to Amazon.    I thought there were two plots:  the one with the old man and his wife; the other, with the trip to Paradise Falls.  There were a lot of adult allusions, especially with the psychopathic collector of animals.  Check it out before you show it to very young children.
B001DPHDCY|4.0|The message behind this one is great, driven in and kept fun.  A great movie based on the story by Suess, a favorite of my kids and now a favorite movie of theirs.  While they already had this one I did pick another copy up for my neice for X-mas.  Recommended to kids and Suess lovers everywhere!
B001IAOEXU|5.0|A must have for all of the PS3 owners. Definitely worth the money, and great for FPS games!
B001JRB16U|5.0|While I loved it as a child, it never occured to me my 3 year old would also love it.  She fell in love with it at my parent's house and sang the songs she learned for weeks afterward.  She looked forward to watching it so much everytime she visited them that I had to pick her up her own copy for X-mas!
B0007TKNIS|5.0|Good movie.  Even my 16 year old is really into this movie.  She's memorized all the songs and taking voice lessons now....
B0013FDM7E|5.0|I love zombies and I love Will Smith.  That said, this was still a top of the line zombie movie (which isn't easy!), and Smith was at his best.  I cry every time I watch this (when he parts with his family and the dog scene).  The special effects are top notch and the story is good, gripping, depressing and hopeful.  A must see for everyone!  Even those who don't love zombies or Will Smith!  But really, how can you not?
B00005NVDF|5.0|\\"Play It Again Sam\\" is a movie I remember seeing in college and loved it. The \\"Casablanca\\" story line made it even more enjoyable. This is a movie that is perfect for a rainy Saturday afternoon. Tony Roberts as a busy executive glued to the phone makes you think what he'd do in in the age of Blackberry and Iphones today. Need a laugh, get this movie.
0810979772|5.0|And while he begged for this one, I relucted to get it since \\"do-it-yourself\\" translated to empty journal for me.  But I relented and bought it for him for X-mas when the price dropped because I knew he wanted it badly.  And I'm not disappointed.  I read through it and while it is a do-it-yourself, it isn't an empty journal.  Sure there are blank pages with suggestions, but theres a lot more and it was definitly worth buying.  For anyone who loves this series, this book is a must and definitly worth the price!
B002VH7P4O|5.0|If this little apple stays true to it's \\"limited edition\\" this could truely be the holy grail of the Beatles and modern music.    As hard as it was, I bypassed updating my 1987 complete Beatles CD catalog with the newly released re-masters.  Trust me, it took serious discipline considering I've been listening to the 1987 releases since, well, 1987 the year they were released. Between \\"The Capital Albums Vols 1 & 2\\" and \\"The Beatles 1\\", these three releases where enough for me to fill the gaps of what I considered poor mixing and poor sound quality on the original 1987 releases.  Get Back, Nowhere Man, Day Tripper, the first half of Past Masters Vol 1 and the first four mono releases in my opinion sound awful.  This poor sound quality and mixes made me want to go back to my 1962-1966 and 1967-1970 vinyl that I bought earlier that year.  Keep in mind I am not an audiophile and my stereo system and turntable at the time was an average Technics.    This brings me to this little apple and why I love it so much.  First and foremost, the 24 bit flac audio. I still don't consider myself an audiophile but I now have a mid to high end audio system where you can clearly tell the difference between the '87 releases and the '09 24 bit flac releases. For me, this was worth the jump. Now If I want the complete remastered catalog on CD, Nero 9 Ultra allows me to rip flac files to wave for CD Burning. This to me is like getting the box set and the USB divice for the price of one. I love the album art and liner notes interface along with the mini documentaries. I love the fact that all this is on one tiny divice seperate from my PC where it can't get accidentally deleted or lost to a computer crash.     I can see this easily being my last purchase of anything commercially released by the Beatles from 1962-1970.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Pixar does it again!  I've never seen a movie by Pixar that wasn't beautiful, and Wall-E is no exception.  Pixar even makes a garbage-filled world beautiful.  Even though the first half of this movie has no dialouge, it is still gripping and humerous.  The second half is even more gripping, a life we are headed towards if we don't make a change.  A great moral story that fits the day and age of now.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|My emotional reaction to extremely young musicians that make quality music is unequivocal, sugar free anger. It's jealousy in its most pure, distilled form. I remember seeing Stephen Steinbrink from French Quarter (appropriately in New Orleans) and just leaving speechless with an urge to speed home, furiously play guitar, and hopefully make up a centimeter in loss ground. XX sounds like it was made by a couple of romantics after a couple decades of damaging relationships. The fact that kids in high school can infuse music with such emotional depth reminds me of how real feelings were at that age. While all people can likely recall such emotional gravity, few can, at any age, express themselves so clearly. This album no doubt demands a certain affect from the listener if it is to be appreciated, but I nonetheless believe few couldn't appreciate the talent behind their hushed, whispering voices.
0792844890|5.0|The classic \\"combing the planet\\" scene has stuck in my head since I first seen it on VHS as a kid.  I have watched it numerous times through the years and always loved it.  Recently I have found my son watching and rewatching it, also loving it!  Some movies truly live forever.  I had to pick this up when it was $2 during the Black Friday week sales on here.
B001MW0J2O|4.0|Animal Collective has to be one of the most, if not the most, buoyant band amongst all the indie hoopla that continues to be spread thinner and thinner. And if my expectations weren't so high for these guys, they would have climbed higher on this list. Not that I needed Merriweather to be perfect. I just wished it had been condensed to an EP, so that I wouldn't feel so guilty leap frogging my way through the latter half of the album. Their melodies continue to be the guiding light through the darkness of their ambient textures, yet the song structures are beginning to occasionally fail. Fall Be Kind EP, released later this year, also had so many great moments, but sort of fell flat as an entity. If the pendulum continues to swing so far from its origin, I fear that the crown they too comfortably wear may be forcibly removed by someone more audience conscious.
B000MNP2KI|3.0|While I miss Brosnan as Bond, the new Bond is okay in my book.  I don' think the franchise is as good as it was but still watchable.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I know it's been said before, but it really, really IS the ultimate feel-good Christmas story - forget Scrooge! I can't resist watching it; I still cry at the usual places and still feel such a warm surge as old George realises the value of his life.  Everyone ought to have a George Bailey moment in their lives...a moment when they realise that with all their flaws and if only in a small way, their life has had meaning for others.  Lovely, lovely old fashioned lovely film!
B000MZHW40|3.0|Decent plot, good cast, good watch, but fades afterwards.  Like many movies these days.  Recommended for any Leo fans and a decent watch all in all, just not the best.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I am an avid reader and I read across many genres.  Although not a \\"literary masterpiece\\" it is wonderfully entertaining!  I thought it was fun to read and couldn't wait to find out what happened next.  The villain in this story was terrific!  I loved to hate him and that made it more fun to read.  This book is a great \\"vacation\\" read and I highly recommend it to  those that enjoyed the Davinci Code.  Did this book have some familiar tones to the Davinci Code? Yes, but I didn't care because it was still very entertaining.<br /><br />Worth the buy!
0061537969|5.0|I'm neither a racing fan nor a dog owner, but the book isn't really about either, of course.  I loved it.  My only criticism is that it's such a fast read, it was over before I knew it, so I'm reading it again.  I just wasn't ready to say good-bye to Enzo yet.  Poignant, funny...a lovely story.
1584282584|5.0|I am a professional photographer who does weddings, bar mitzvahs, portraits and events.  I am a voracious reader of photography books (I have read over to 100) and I constantly practice and learn. This book took me to the next level in a way that no other resource has during my career. I constantly refer back to this book to improve my photography skills.    If you are interested in improving your exposure metering skills, both with ambient light and flash, this is the book.  The author explains the techniques for using the camera's built-in meter, using the histogram, using the blinking highlights display, the Sunny 16 rule and using the LCD.  He explains the zone system and how to meter for dark and light subjects.  The metering system in a digital camera wants to render both light and dark objects as middle grey, so understanding how to meter properly is crucial for the professional photographer, especially to make a wedding dress white and show off its detail.    The author explains how to make on-camera flash a bigger light source to create soft, natural, diffuse light.  He also explains how on-camera flash can be used to create directional light for texture, contrast, mood and more interesting photographs.  The technique is called bounce flash and once you learn this technique your photography will reach new levels. There is great advice about using flash modifiers.  Try making your own flash modifier and you will never go back to the \\"tupperware\\" modifiers.     The biggest revelation in this book was how to squeeze the most out of my camera, lens and flash.  I use professional Nikon cameras and professional Nikon lenses and speedlights.  Until I read and digested this book I was not using these tools to their fullest.  The book helped me learn how use the high ISO capabilities of my cameras and wide aperture capabilities of my lens and bouncing capabilities of my flash to get properly exposed, razor sharp pictures with just the right amount of light in dark banquet halls... and at the same time lighten the backgrounds so the picture opens up and does not suffer from picture killing black backgrounds.  This is not easy to do, but once you understand how to do it, your pictures move to a higher level that the point-and-shoot photographers can not match.    I have recommended this book to my partner and all my photographer friends. If you take the time to read and digest this book your photography will move to a higher level.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|When this movie came out, I loved it!  In fact, I listened to the music from Johnny Mathis (\\"The Last Time I Felt Like This\\") over and over.<br /><br />In this movie, the premise seems trite.  A couple meets, spends a weekend together, and that's it.  But it isn't, and this particular couple, played by Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn, decides to meet again the \\"same time next year.\\"  And then, over the next couple of decades, we see the two of them connect again and again.  We watch them as they grow and change--sometimes she grows more than he, and sometimes vice versa.<br /><br />We're kind of rooting for them to get together, but we also know, on some level, that if this relationship were to become permanent, it would change...irrevocably.<br /><br />I love the pairing of these two actors, and the theme music from Johnny Mathis evokes so many emotions in me...from that time.  It transports me back to what was happening in my own life.<br /><br />A memorable movie that touches on emotions and reminds us that it's the moments in life that are most memorable.
B002ZJGN96|5.0|This album is so dynamic. The audio recording of the orchestra is extremely well done, all of the low and high frequency are present (also thanks to Amazon's VBR encoding).<br /><br />five out of five stars.
B0026P3G12|5.0|On the basis of other voice competition artists' releases, I actually didn't expect this album to turn out well, but I was oh-so-pleasantly surprised.     All I can say to those who have issues with the song selection, production, or whatever, is this:  if you approach this CD with the desire to get to know who Susan is, you may not only be surprised how much you like the CD but also how much you love the Susan who is laying out her soul for us to enjoy. One thing I learned from this work is that the real Susan Boyle is best - and perhaps really only - expressed by her singing.    This is not about \\"entertainment.\\" This is about a person sharing herself, in a most beautiful, pure, and deep way. This is more than being about her singing voice; it's about her personal voice as well.    Susan is someone who is sometimes sad and lonely, sometimes lifted by her faith in the universe, sometimes proud and defiant. And personally, I love each and every song, no matter that they are covers. Susan makes them her own, and that is NOT a trite cliche in this case - that one of the many special attributes of this masterpiece.    Thank you, Susan!!!!

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Up is one of the most beautiful movies in a long time.  It is a rare thing when a movie makes the viewer love the characters in the first 15-30 minutes.  This movie does just that and is a triumph of emotional beauty.  Of course it has its comedy and its far fetched moments.  However, I sat in the theater with my wife, both of us tearing up with lumps in our throats in the first half hour of the movie.  This sets the stage for a fun adventure that ends in a bittersweet triumph. The story is about life long love and the willingness to do almost anything to see your dreams through.  It is also a story of recovery from grief, and it is about getting a new lease on life.  See it with your wife or girlfriend.
B0029LHW68|3.0|Don't get me wrong, the music is amazing.  I am always impressed with their songwriting abilities, but leave the politics to others who aren't tainted by hollywood fantasy.  A little news flash for you Mr. Leto.  If Obama gets his socialist Utopia, you won't get to keep the millions you make with your capitalist music industry.      Again, great music, but Obama sucks and doesn't deserve the tribute.    Ron Paul 2012!
0375842381|5.0|I have to admit that i was a bit relentles with buying by internet, and internationally, that's why i only bought the Dark Materials Trilogy, \\"just in case\\", but i was surprised not only because it arrived in great conditions, but also because arrived earlier than expected (it was supposed to arrived on december 9th, and it came on november 20 something). thanks Amazon for the books, it came before my birthday, and cheaper than i would've bought it here in Chile.   ps:sorry for my misspelling, but my english has got a bit rusty with the years
B000001ES9|5.0|If you like Rush do not miss out on this great bunch of tunes. The first album and in my opinion the very best
0385504225|5.0|The book arrived quickly and in brand new condition as stated, I was very happy with the service.
0451191153|5.0|This book as well as its companion Atlas Shrugged are two books no one should go without reading at least once in their lives. Both give a true insight to the very nature of man.
0439023483|3.0|The book arrived in good condition, however it was missing the jacket to the book. I was a little disappointed about this. The book still arrived in a timely manner and in new condition.
B00021HBGS|5.0|Bath time is much more fun now for my 2 year old son.  This is a great product.
0439023491|4.0|The book arrived in new condition as stated and came in a timely manner, I was happy with the service.
0395775590|2.0|I read that this was supposed to be the best book by an African author.  I got half way through and could not finish it.  There is an essay by Orwell in the book that is great.  It is a textbook with related readings which I thought would be a fantastic way to enjoy a book; if the book itself happened to be to my liking.
0439796636|5.0|The War Horse is written from the perspective of the horse and is on a parr with Anna Sewell's, Black Beauty. Like Black Beauty, the story hinges on relationships, both horse to horse and horse to human. Every horse lover, no matter their age, will appreciate the story of the commitment and love of a boy for his horse.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|First I just want to say that I have read the book and love it. Second, I am realistic and know that they have to adapt a book in order to make it into a movie.  With that said I really did enjoy it. As a person who enjoys movies, it was well done. I personally didn't care for the shaking of the camera but I know its some type of artistic spin so whatever.   Wentworth was amazing (not to mention hot). I didn't really care for Anne's character at first but she grew on me.    I really recommend watching more than once because the more I watch it, the more I love it.
B002T921AC|1.0|MY ORIGINAL REVIEW ON DECEMBER 14th 2009:<br />Take a pretty face and spread it all over the media, and it will sell, regardless of talent. And that is the case with Justin Bieber.<br /><br />Seriously. My country has produced some bad music, but nothing as abominable as Justin Bieber.<br /><br />UPDATE ON FEBURARY 2ND 2010:<br />I am now completely disgusted with Justin Bieber and his agent. After the rating fell into the 2.9 area and almost all of the reviews were becoming negative, suddenly someone (presumably company shills) has been flooding this page with 3 sentence, 5 star reviews that hardly say anything but that he's \\"amazing\\", falling in line with the newer trend of buying reviews for CDs (not to mention buying CDs because it's what's \\"hot\\". Shame on you Mr. Bieber for not letting your own product stand on its own, and shame on you for telling reviewers their opinions are as worth nothing. You are being disrespectful to constructive critics that way, and nobody said you had to care about negative comments, but you are being a jerk.
0812976525|4.0|Most things about this book are not new to anyone. We all know that the industry is full of twisted people who just want the most money that they can get and will say anything and hurt other people. Well, lots of business is like that. But that's besides the point. If you're looking for hard facts and statistics, look elsewhere. Not the book for you.    It was, however, an entertaining read. You won't enjoy this if you are too serious a person because it is somewhat ridiculous, in an unfortunately truthful way.    I suppose it would be good to know that I am not a smoker. I actually have very adverse reactions to cigarette smoke, so I would say that creates some bias. And I also strongly dislike big business.     For me this was an easy, enjoyable read.
0307454541|1.0|This is a well written book filled with twists and turns BUT be warned that if you are a person who has been a victim of sexual abuse this may be a very triggering and painful book for you to read. The violence and in depth descriptions of sexual assault and brutalization are horrifying. I wish I had known, before I bought the book, the depths the darkness would reach.
0385474547|1.0|First off, this book is TERRIBLE, I repeat TERRIBLE!!! It's such a confusing book to read and the names are way too hard to pronounce. It sucked! I wish that I was blind so i didnt have to suffer reading through this terrible book for my sophomore year at school. I hope one day i will have a few extra dollars to buy this book and then tear the pages out and throw them in my fire pit. And I have read some really boring books, and when i read a boring book i usually finish it, but this book, i give an exception to not finish it was that much torture to read! Okay, the first page you read you will not understand whats even going on. So far in class we're supposed to be at about chapter 8 I stopped reading it it was sooooo boring!! It made me want to tear my eyes out and torture myself! It's like thee worst book you could ever read. If I were you people out there who are thinking of buying this book, i would just go find another book, this will take time out of your day and it's like throwing away your money on a sucky book, and its like being in a torture chamber and your about to die! So take my word for it dont ever ever ever EVER! read this book, once you get to about the 2nd chapter your all gonna wish you never bought it, it's such a waste of money. I mean really, what's the point of supporting such a sucky book by purchasing it, you will regret it! Trust me, dont even look at this book and think \\"oh interesting\\" u will thank me later!  Don't ever read this book! Your welcome! :)
1906694176|4.0|Steig Larrson's first 2 volumes were great...the third volume is a bit tiresome as the pieces(good vs. evil) on each side line up for their battle. Alot of proceedural descriptions and not enough of Lisbeth.
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|POSITIVE:  Nearly everything.  This is one of my favorite concert DVD's.  Every song is really really great.  It's upbeat, it's interesting, it's energetic, the musicianship is really excellent, the hall is awesome, the audience enthusiastic.  Despite some little niggles, below, this is a \\"if you like the Killers, definitely get this\\" kinda deal.    The filming is excellent, if a bit too frenetic at times.  It does capture the excitement and the great lighting well.  It'd be nice to focus on one musician for longer periods, especially when they're doing cool stuff.  I liked the theme of the camera moving into the hall, and following the band, and then leaving at the end.  The bit following the lead out into the hall (and lowering the sound) and then to the balcony was a nice touch.    MINOR GRIPE: My only real critical comment is about sound quality....where did the cymbals go?  You can barely hear them in the mix and the drummer is amazing, so we're missing some really cool stuff.  I tried playing this on my friend's system (same problem), checked that my system was working, all channels, because literally, the cymbals are mostly lost.  You can hear them from a distance, especially when nothing else is playing, but there is no direct sound.  All the subtle stuff you can see him doing is barely audible.  This is a huge loss as the whole concert would be richer with these percussive details.  How did they miss this in the sound room?       In general the sound is OK, but not the DVD's strong point.  I've heard much better mixes on DVD's where you can hear each instrument distinctly, the singer's voices are clear and strong, and the sense of space is captured.  If there's one place for the producers to improve on, it's the sound quality.  (Bluray doesn't fix that, of course, because if it's not recorded well, the format won't fix it.).       OK, end of gripe section- the concert is awesome  and the DVD is still totally worth it!
0307266303|5.0|This book is very interesting on a number of levels.  Firstly, it is a spellbinding story about assorted elite runners and other characters who take part in an ultra marathon race in Copper Canyons in the Mexican state of Chihuahua with some of the best runners in the Taramuhara tribe.  Secondly, it is a story about Christopher McDougall's own journey, from an oft-injured, very amateur runner to someone capable of partaking in the ultra marathon race.  Thirdly, for those of us previously not familiar with the Taramuhara, it gives us a basic understanding of the tribe, its athletic prowess and the challenges it faces in the 21st century.  Fourthly, for those of us who do not live in the world of ultra marathons, it provides a peak behind the curtain into this world and the personalities that populate it.  Lastly, it is a well written advocate of two basic theories about running: that man is born to run great distances but his quest for efficiency has led to a much more sedentary lifestyle, and that running and walking in modern shoes have led mankind to walk and run in unintended ways that have resulted in many more foot and leg injuries than previously.  Christopher McDougall weaves these threads together into a very entertaining, readable book.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This movie has great action scenes and for the reason I loved \\"The Next Generation\\" of Star Trek, it has a great story line.  It brings back so many memories of the original TV Star Trek with Captain Kirk and his crew.  They are all depicted very well in their younger state.  Thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Season Two of Sons of Anarchy kept me glued to my seat.    Would like to see a little bit more interaction between Tara & Jax and people in their community.   Great program.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|I bought this album first thing this morning and on the first listen i honestly told myself,\\"I can see myself really getting into this album--still not quite as good as as i am but thats okay\\"(who really outdoes themselves back to back on every album, i think it's always a lot of hit and miss and because you really like the artist you take the good with the not so good)    Note:What i don't understand is why other reviewers have to form some kind of an opinion about other peoples reviews--everybodys entitled to their own opinion its not that serious.    Now to the album--I,as a fluent music listener and alicia keys fan,appreciate when an artist changes it up every album,i also believe its not fair to compare albums unless the album is just really gagrbage---and this album is NOT garbage--trust me.This album is just a distinct change from alicia's normal style(which every album has been--go listen before you speak)and i appreciate it.Just give it a chance--i think if you are a true alicia keys fan, and not just someone who calls themselves a fan because she's popular and you thought it was the cool thing to buy her previous albums,you'll really enjoy this album.It may not hit you as soon as As I Am probably did but youll still enjoy it very much.GREAT LYRICS,GREAT TRACKS,GREAT TOPICS,GREAT VOICE.    HIGHLIGHTS:  Love is Blind  Thats How Strong my Love is  Love is my Disease  Like the Sea  Distance and Time  How it Feels to Fly    others are still really good..    THANKS ALICIA
B002VLNB1Q|4.0|Not as good as \\"Continuum\\" but still better than most of the garbage being put out these days. There should always be a place for real musicianship.............
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is a wonderful album.  It really shows the range of Susan's voice.  I would heartily recommend it.  You should hear what she does with Wild Horses, written by Keith Richards.  Lovely!
B00078XKDE|4.0|The Kills - No Wow is a great album. It is a great piece of rock. I love them. I enjoyed the first album, so I bought this one.
B000MR9D5E|2.0|There were a lot of scratches on the dvd's, i should have bought this brand new...

B000Q6GX5Y|1.0|The movie was amazing.  Unfortunately the Blu-Ray was NOT.  My DVD version of 300 looks 10 times better than this garbage which is no exaggeration.  The moment I received it in the mail I popped it into my not yet one month old blu-ray replacement player and was overly disappointed.  If it weren't for the fact that I'd have to pay return shipping I'd send it back and tell them to give it to their dog as a chew-toy.  It just isn't worth purchasing so go ahead and get the regular DVD which has the better picture.  I've noticed that the BR of 300 was incorporated with the grainy/nastiness and if this is the case it was an epic fail.  Other than the quality of the disk the movie itself was awesome but then again Gerard Butler is a spectacular actor and I've loved nearly all of his movies.
B002IYEQR4|3.0|(UPDATED 12/18/09)<br /><br />Even though I'm not a big movie fan, I decided to get this movie for my Blu-Ray player which has been rather collecting dust over the past couple of months.<br /><br />The movie looks great, sharp, full of vibrant colors and no blurriness.<br /><br />The movie can get boring at times, I was hoping this would be as entertainment as Sin City, but it really isn't.  The acting isn't great either, Jackie Earle Haley who plays Rorschach is probably the best of the bunch and an excellent actor in my opinion, but the rest of the actors are really bland. Carla Gugino being a great actress is only seen for about 10 minutes (give or take) of the entire movie and not given a major role. I think she would've made a great Sally Jupiter II instead of Malin Akerman.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that this box set comes with [[ASIN:B001QFYLKS Watchmen: The Complete Motion Comic (+ BD-Live) [Blu-ray]]] which is $20 by itself.  This bring this whole box set to a whooping 3 blu-ray discs plus 1 DVD for the digital copy.  I had said that the digital copy expires soon but someone clarified in the comments that the digital copy doesn't expire until November 3, 2010.  So you have until then to use yours.<br /><br />Speaking of the motion comic I din't believe when people said it was better than the actual movie but after watching a couple of episodes, I have to say that it really is.  It makes more sense that the movie and is more entertaining.<br /><br />Overall if you can get this for $30 bucks or under, I would get it, over that and I would pass on this product, unless you're a hardcore fan of comics and/or Watchmen.
0385341008|5.0|You might pick up The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society because of its curious name, but you'll keep reading long after that curiosity is satisfied. The novel tells the story of Juliet Ashton, a newspaper writer in post World War II London who develops a relationship with a book club on Guernsey, an island recently occupied by the Germans. As the relationship deepens, both Juliet and her new friends begin to recover from the horrors of the war.<br /><br />The entire book is told through letters written by Juliet and Guernsey book club members (and friends), and Juliet's sense of humor could make it easy to dismiss the book as a \\"light read.\\" But I think co-authors Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows pulled off a near miracle by balancing an intriguing plot, well-researched WWII history, heart-wrenching stories of war, a massive cast of quirky characters, loads of literary references and a love story. It can't be easy to recount the awful things that happened during the war in a way that even soft-hearted readers can stomach, leaving the audience with a powerful swelling of hope for the future.

0375842209|5.0|We rate our books between 1-4. This book rates beyond a 4. It is a must read.    Liesel is 9 years old when she watches her little brother die in their mother's arms. They are on a train to their new foster parents.  Death, the narrator of this story, is on the train to take the brother's soul to eternity. Death is not a bad or evil presence, he has a job to do, which he isn't very fond of, but it has to be done.    After Liesel's brother is buried and as she is leaving the cemetary, she stops to pick up a book the grave digger has dropped. The book, ' The Grave Digger's Handbook', is the first of many that Liesel will steal. Liesel is sent to live with her new foster parents. Her mother can no longer take care of her and her father was taken away by the Germans for supposedly being a Communist. Her new papa, Hans, begins to read the book Liesel has stolen, to Liesel when she wakes up every night from a nightmare. It is also the book he will use to teach her how to read.    Liesel becomes very good friends with a neighbor boy, Rudy. Together, they will share in play, stealing, and being each other's best friend.    Han's past will catch up with him when a young jew named Max comes to live in his basement to hide from the Nazis. Max and Liesel form a friendship through books, stories of everyday life, and one book that will literally save Liesel's life.    Here is a different voice of WWII. We hear from the German people and their horrifying time during the war with: the Nazi police, the youth groups, (which their children must participate),  the air raids and bombings, recruitments into the war, survivers guilt,  and the Jews marching through the streets like cattle and no one allowed to help them. Zusak is a gifted writer using words in a way that our group called poetic. His thematic and sensory descriptions take you swiftly through Liesel's story via Death's voice and observations. One major point in this story is how strong and powerful words are since that iswhat Hitler used to begin this war. I like what one member said about death, \\"Nobody gets out alive, it's how you get out that matters.\\"
B002XHN776|2.0|That moment the hot guy in school grabs your hand and walks away with you in front of everyone.....sound familiar? Anyone who has seen My So-Called Life in the 90's knows that moment. Most of us the age of the characters, felt that same excitement. It seems Jordan Catalano is remembering to. If you have had a peek at This is War, 30 Seconds to Mars' follow up to A Beautiful Lie, you have just relived the whole one and only season of the show that made him a household name.<br /><br />Its that teenage angst almost rearing its head, except these characters are in their 30s. The angst is long gone, or should be. Leto strains every last emotion he has left into the songs and some how still comes short, unless the war is chanting fans or Tibetan Monks. They are on his side and it seems almost every song. I had to keep checking iTunes to see if it was on repeat.
031606792X|2.0|As several of the readers have already stated, I too read the first three books within a weeks time. I was completely taken in with the \\"forbidden\\" love that Bella and Edward shared. Not being a fan of the science fiction world, I was amazed at how Meyer was able to capture my attention and make this scenario on the verge of believable until I began the fourth book. I felt she rushed me through Bella's and Edwards life without giving me the feeling I felt at the beginning of the series. Bella lost who she was in the fourth book, (what happened to the girl who loved her old truck and would have never put on a frilly wedding dress despite what Alice wanted) and what happened to the complexity of the Edward character? He became so 2 dimensional.  Then Jacob imprinting w/ the baby??? You have got to be kidding me???? The fact that the baby came along at all was insane. In all love triangles, SOMEONE has to lose, simple as that!!!  I guess I wanted Edward to change her in a more \\"romantic\\" type setting that would entail his lips on her throat, not with her bones breaking while everyone in Forks watches. Sigh - oh well, we can all hope that she'll write an alternate ending? Ha ha!!!
B0026P3G12|5.0|\\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" is a dream come true! It isn't often that I buy a DVD and love every track. WOW - don't miss out on this one no matter your age. Susan's music is for all ages and all seasons. A Classic! My mother is 78 and crazy about this DVD. We're both thrilled.
B0025KVLTW|4.0|Originally released as a six-track double-EP in the United Kingdom, the Beatles' \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" emerged as a full-fledged album in America thanks to the inclusion of the group's 1967 singles. Judged on its own merits, the \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" soundtrack is uneven psychedelic whimsy highlighted by John Lennon's brilliant \\"I Am the Walrus\\" and Paul McCartney's dreamlike \\"The Fool on the Hill.\\" Ironically, the title song captures the enthusiastic spirit that eluded the TV movie. The unfortunate low point is George Harrison's endlessly droning \\"Blue Jay Way.\\" Still, the glorious addition of \\"Hello Goodbye,\\" \\"Strawberry Fields Forever,\\" \\"Penny Lane,\\" \\"Baby You're a Rich Man\\" and \\"All You Need Is Love\\" place the overall record in the essential category. (A pity that \\"Penny Lane\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" were dropped from \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" for the urgent necessity of a new single.)
B002SJIO54|5.0|District 9 not only had awesome effects, soundtrack and realistic actors, but it had a great plot which finally did not make aliens the bad guys for once. I saw the movie twice and can't wait to see the extra features of the dvd. Must have movie!
B000ZELISO|4.0|While I would agree with the purists out there who felt somewhat cheated by this film leaving out vital details that are integral to the nature of Voldemort and his motivation while adding in three time consuming scenes that added nothing to the story whatsoever.  I also understand that movies have time constraints and studios don't want movies to be too long because that cuts down on the number of times the movie can be shown thus cutting into profits.  I get it.      *****MILD SPOILERS BE AHEAD******  I would have rather seen the memory of Tom Riddle trying to get on as the Defense against the Dark Arts teacher but being turned away which is the reason the post is now cursed than the Bridge Collapse scene.  Or Maybe the Dursleys at the beginning where Harry inherits Grimauld Place and Kreacher all at once instead of Harry chatting up a waitress at a train station.  Or some explanation as to the fact that the remaining Horcruxes would be tied to the Hogwarts founders because of how important Hogwarts was to Voldemort or maybe Dumbledore's funeral instead of the attack on the burrough.  And Harry not being petrified on the astronomy tower is just unforgiveable.  Lots of stuff that come part 7 isn't going to make a whole lot of sense if it is just dropped in out of nowhere.    *****NO MORE SPOILERS*****    All that being said the movie is still really good and very well made It just seems like they made it because they felt like they had to instead of truly wanting to bridge the gap to the final chapter in the saga.  3+ stars for the actual movie.    Where it gets the extra star is for the amazing bonus features that I haven't even gotten the opportunity to scratch the surface of yet.  The brief but excellent featurette on the Deathly Hallows is outstanding.  The deleted scenes are okay.  A couple that could and probably SHOULD have been left in the final film.  The featurette on the Wizarding World opening up at Universal Orlando next year has me completely geeked to go.  They are outstanding.    So to sum it up.  If you are a Harry Potter fan and enjoyed the movie even a little bit definately pick this up if for nothing else than the extra bonus features.  If you hated the movie but are still a fan see if you can borrow a copy to watch the bonus stuff.  It's worth every minute spent.

I have loved music more than any other art or media form since I was old enough to know what music was.  Muse is beautiful, unhindered, melodic, complex, and powerful. Quite simply, Muse has created the music my ears and soul have been waiting for my entire life.
B001UJSW6Y|5.0|Despite my loyalty to Olivero, Corelli and Bastianini in the live 1959 Naples recording - one of the greatest documents of its kind - I have to give this 1977 set pride of place. First, the sound is amazingly clear and atmospheric; secondly, Levine's direction is so sensitive and fluent, wholly responsive to the ebb and flow of this rip-roaring verismo classic; thirdly, the singers surpass themselves: Milnes creates a fully rounded, subtly sung Michonnet and really draws out the character's pathos; Domingo is heroic and nuanced, Scotto sublime in the depth of her characterisation and the delicacy of her quieter singing, Obratsova stupendously powerful and stirring as the jealous Princess - and even the supporting cast is flawless; especially good is the bass who sings the Prince, Giancarlo Luccardi, a singer unknown to me but who ought to be more famous. OK, the beat in Scotto's voice in louder, higher passages, just slightly bothers me, but her artistry virtually silences criticism.<br /><br />I still love the old Naples version and have time, too, for Tebaldi and Del Monaco in their barn-storming performance, but this is the set to introduce anyone frightened of opera to a truly memorable, melodic, dramatic experience - a wonderful recording which makes me wonder why this most tuneful and gripping of operas (despite the hokey denouement) is not more often performed.<br /><br />P.S. Be warned - no libretti in this series, only synopses.
B001GZ6QDS|2.0|I bought this DVD from Amazon because it stated that there was a digital copy.  My son wanted the digital copy for his Ipod.  When I received it, there is no digital copy.  The digital copy expired on 12/9/09 and I received it today 12/15/09.  My plans were to give this DVD to my son as part of his Christmas.  I am disappointed about the expiration of the digital copy.  This should have not been put in the fine print at the end of the description.  Instead it should have been placed at the top for people to plainly see.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Warning, if you start watching this show you may finish the series in a day or two and be left with a sad feeling of what could have been had the show run another 2 or 3 seasons.

B001N44BVQ|5.0|This movie is based on the novel of the same name by David Ignatius, Editorial Colmnist for The Washington Post.<br /><br />Mr. Ignatius recently posted a column about the passing of the real-life spy, Gen. Saad Kheir, on whom he based the character 'Hani Pasha,' played by British actor Mark Strong in the movie.<br /><br />Mr. Ignatius wrote:<br /><br />Jordan's ace of spies<br /><br />By David Ignatius<br />Sunday, December 13, 2009<br /><br />When the spy movie ends, the suave intelligence chief -- having outsmarted his enemies -- dusts off the lapels of his perfectly tailored suit and disappears into his world of illusion and control.<br /><br />That's not how it ended in real life, alas, for Gen. Saad Kheir, the brilliant but emotionally wounded spymaster who headed Jordan's General Intelligence Department (GID) from 2000 to 2005. He died in a hotel room in Vienna on Wednesday of a heart attack, the official Jordanian news agency reported. He was just 56.<br /><br />Kheir at his best was among the greatest Arab intelligence officers of his generation. He ran a series of masterful penetration operations against Palestinian extremist groups and, later, al-Qaeda. \\"He set the standard for how we do it,\\" said one former CIA officer who worked closely with him.<br /><br />I got to know Kheir five years ago when I was researching a novel about the Middle East called \\"Body of Lies,\\" which was later made into a movie that starred Leonardo DiCaprio. Kheir was the model for my fictional Jordanian intelligence chief, \\"Hani Salaam.\\" Like all GID chiefs, Kheir was addressed by the Ottoman honorific of \\"pasha,\\" so I gave the sobriquet of \\"Hani Pasha\\" to my fictional version.<br /><br />Hani Pasha (played in the movie by British actor Mark Strong) stole the show, and for a simple reason -- he was based on a true master of the game. My character's tradecraft, manners, even his wardrobe were all modeled on those of the real pasha.<br />It was George Tenet, then director of the CIA, who first described to me Kheir's brilliance as an operator. I asked Tenet in 2003 if any foreign intelligence services had been especially helpful against al-Qaeda, and he answered instantly, \\"The Jordanians,\\" and continued with Tenetian enthusiasm, \\"Their guy Saad Kheir is a superstar!\\"<br /><br />So the next time I was in Amman, I asked the royal palace if I could meet the legendary intelligence chief, and it was duly arranged. I was driven to the GID's fearsome headquarters, past its black flag bearing the ominous warning in Arabic \\"Justice Has Come\\" and escorted upstairs to the pasha's office.<br /><br />Kheir had a rough, boozy charm -- somewhere between Humphrey Bogart and Omar Sharif. He was dressed elegantly, as always -- in this case, a cashmere blazer, a knit tie and a pair of what looked to be handmade English shoes.<br /><br />The pasha told me a few stories, and others filled in the details: He made his name penetrating Palestinian extremist groups, such as the Abu Nidal organization. Once he had burrowed into the terrorists' lair, he was able to plant rumors and disinformation that set the group's members fighting among themselves. Before long, Abu Nidal's fraternity of killers had imploded in a frenzy of suspicion and self-destruction. I stole that idea for \\"Body of Lies.\\"<br /><br />Kheir researched his targets so thoroughly that he got inside their lives. A former CIA officer told me about one sublime pitch: Kheir tracked a jihadist to an apartment in Eastern Europe and handed him a cellphone, saying: \\"Talk to your mother.\\" The man's mom was actually on the line, telling him he was a wonderful son for buying her a new TV and a couch and sending her money. \\"The spoken message was, 'We can do good things for you.' The unspoken message was, 'We can hurt you,' \\" explained the CIA officer. I took that scene, too, verbatim.<br /><br />Like many Arab intelligence services, the GID has a reputation for using brutal interrogation methods, and I'm sure that it didn't get the nickname \\"the fingernail factory\\" for nothing. But Kheir's successes in interrogation often came from a different kind of intimidation. Colleagues recall him standing behind a suspect, his voice deep with menace, as he talked of the suspect's family, friends and contacts. That was much scarier than physical violence would have been. He waited for them to break themselves, and it usually worked.<br /><br />Kheir ran afoul of his boss, King Abdullah, when he began pushing into politics and business. It was the classic overreach of intelligence chiefs in the Middle East, and he was sacked in 2005. His dismissal took a cruel toll: Kheir could be seen carousing late at night at his favorite restaurant in Amman, no longer a master of the universe or even, fully, master of himself. But in his prime, he was a genius, and it's hard to think of a foreigner who helped save more American lives than Saad Pasha.at it didn't get the nickname \\"the fingernail factory\\" for nothing.

B0000AM6IY|5.0|This was the first time for me to buy from Amazon and I was a little apprehensive. I am of the older generation and not so tech savvy as the new generation. I ordered a movie that in passing my wife mentioned was one of her all time favorites. It arrived in just a few days I was pleasantly surprised. We put it in the dvd player and nothing I tried everything. I put a few dvd's that we knew worked to find out for sure the one we just got from Amazon did not work. Well you can imagine my concern returning dvd's opened never happens for obvious reasons. I figured we would just have to eat it, so to speak. I went online to see what I could do to return it, and it was a little scary, I wasn't sure what would happen. To my surprise there were no road blocks there was a new one on the way before I had even sent the bad one back. I cannot say enough of how this was handled, I would buy anything from Amazon.com again without any fear at all. Thank you Amazon.com for making me a very happy customer.    Best regards  Michael Edzards
B00000AFDW|3.0|Review no. 266. Knew that I still had my copy of this Kiss CD somewhere - just took me a few minutes to dig it up. I've heard some old school Kiss fans and followers - comment that 'Psycho Circus' is even worse than 'Unmasked' - now that's saying something. I, for one - didn't feel that this CD was dreadful at all. It's okay. Tunes that I thought managed to somewhat stand out were &#34;I Pledge Allegiance To The State Of Rock 'N Roll&#34;, &#34;Into The Void&#34;, the Top 40-ish &#34;We Are One&#34;, maybe &#34;Dreamin' and &#34;Journey Of 1,000 Years&#34;. Certainly not the best Kiss CD - but their follow-up 'Sonic Boom' more than makes up for it.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|I have been using these headphones for a month now  There's a lot I want to say here; but here's the gist, I do more gaming than movie watching, and I'm happy that I bought these headphones for gaming.     I think that I had unrealistic expectations going into this. I was expecting something along the lines of 3D sound, which isn't even available with current video game sound design.   Once I got over that, I was able to enjoy these headphones. I think that excellent sound is way more immersive than having an HDtv. With these headphones, you do get a sense of surround sound, however it's not an equal replacement for an actual 7.1 surround sound system. In game when there is a lot going on all around you, you can't easily distinguish which direction those sounds are coming from, if you had a proper surround sound system, you would be able to tell that the speaker in the right of the room is what's making the sound, etc. All that being said, I'll be honest, I've got a small apartment, and don't have room to install a full 7.1 surround sound system; not to mention, it would be way too expensive.     Bottom line: If you are considering this versus a $200 surround sound system, then buy this. However, this is for gaming. If you want to have surround sound for watching lots of movies (with friends), then buy a speaker system.   I guess my ears must be big, because these can start to hurt, but when I'm in the middle of a game, I'm too preoccupied to notice. I think that it's VERY IMPORTANT to mention that there is no sense of distance to the sound. I have tested this tons of times in game, and you can only determine direction of the sound origin. Other reviews talk about hearing extra audio effects that you never heard on the TV and that's true, but those two NPCs talking over in that bunker sound just as loud when you a good distance away as they do if you were right next to them (it is this problem that bugs me the most, but maybe that's sound design and not the headphones). Also, I read some complaints about the communicator and game chat, I disagree, I have no complaints about it, I think it works just fine.
B0026P3G12|3.0|I love Susan Boyle and she has an amazing voice.  This CD does not do her justice.    I immediately bought the download of \\"Dream\\" and my wife bought the CD for me. I have to admit I am disappointed.    The capture of Susan's amazing voice is not as good as it should be.  Sadly, Susan actually sounds better on the YouTube videos and on TV.      Those who produced, arranged and engineered this CD have fallen far short of what it should have been.  Either they don't like her or they don't know what they're doing.    The choir backing Susan in SILENT NIGHT is terrible.  They sound like they are shouting the words without feeling and there is no richness to their tone.  They lend nothing to the classic Christmas carol.  Susan would have been better singing it alone, without any accompaniment or with just an acoustic guitar.      In her signature song - \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" her voice cracks at 1:13 on the word \\"night\\" and nobody noticed and went back to fix it.    Susan is a finally a show business success and this first CD will dramatically improve her financial situation.      Here's hoping, a better team will be assembled for her next CD.        Susan does need to polish her show business persona a bit but she seems like a good person and she has a wonderful voice.  We wish her well in all that she does from here.
B0026P3G12|1.0|Whoever produced this album should be fired!  They took a beautiful voice, put horrid background music to it, sometimes only a piano, it was awful.  Susan's voice is beautiful and I am a fan of her's but she needs better guidance for her albums.    The songs are a jumble of different types of music.  Her gospel is just beautiful but should be with a gospel album, Silent night was the best version I have ever heard but should not have been on this album but a Christmas album.  Susan they are trying to take the spirit of your music from you, don't let it happen.  You have unbelievable talent so don't let them guide you, they don't know what they are doing!  Bettie

Brandon Lee's performance was great, and his death is a terrible tragedy.  Wish it hadn't happened, could have had more movies with him in them.
078322947X|5.0|I've seen this movie, \\"Sorcerer\\" on television numerous times and I simply enjoy it and would like to watch it again at my own discretion instead of waiting (probably forever anymore) for it to come to television again.

B000002J1S|5.0|Genesis was the master of creating musical melodies and moments which were reaching to the center of our hearts and into our souls. Very often these vocal parts were created and delivered by Peter Gabriel but even later on after his departure they were continued fairly well by Phil Collins. The music of Genesis, in a similar way to the music of Yes, was building up into the gorgeous instrumental overtures exploding in moments full of emotion. The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway contains more of such emotional thresholds than any other album of Genesis. I ended up picking TLLDOB as my favorite album of theirs but for me it is a very close call between this double album, Foxtrot and Nursery Crime. The Musical Box, one of their most beautiful and my favorite song is a part of Nursery Crime and The Supper Is Ready, an amazing suite was released on Foxtrot. The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway is one the most quintessential albums of a progressive symphonic rock era. Unlike the beauty of Close To The Edge or Tales From Topographic Oceans, the power of music coming to us from TLLDOB comes in small segments of beauty, broken up, but all together creating a masterful experience full of feeling and sympathy for the main character of their complex story and the concept behind it. The double album is composed of 23 songs 9 of each are not even 3 minute long and another 5 fall below 4 minutes. However, they all transition into each other very well, creating a long overture of various shorter moods falling together well and quite fitting for telling the story about the split personality of its main character. It is the beauty of many keyboard driven passages and the sound of Peter's voice which makes this work so appealing to me. Some phrases and sentences always seemed to have affected me the most: `there's sunshine in my stomach like I just rocked my baby to sleep' is one of these pictures painted which to me mean more than a long elaborate text. Or: `If I keep self control I'll be safe in my soul. And the childhood belief brings a moment's relief, but my cynic soon returns and the lifeboat burns. My spirit just never learns.' And again: `I need someone to believe in, someone to trust. I'd rather trust a countryman than a townman. You can judge by his eyes, take a look if you can. He'll smile through his guard, survival trains hard. I'd rather trust a man who works with his hands. He looks at you once, you know he understands. Don't need any shield, when you're out in the field.' And: `I'd rather trust a man who doesn't shout what he's found'. While performing this rock opera (I guess we can call it that) on stage throughout 1975 Peter Gabriel was introducing listeners to the first 6 songs, then again to the next 5 and again to the following 12 songs by coming on stage and explaining what was going to happen to the main character, to assure the maximum involvement of his audience. By doing that, dressed in different one of his costumes every time, he was truly mesmerizing the audience. He brought their interest to the forefront and then he and the rest of the band made them experience emotions far exceeding their expectations. With their Lamb Lies Down On Broadway a very successful Genesis of their prior work took our small earth by storm and assured a great interest in the future albums coming from this band as well as from all of their members. It almost got to the point where the colossal success of this album forced them to break up, as there was no space for them to grow together. The earth was becoming too small for them... I am obviously joking, but I guess on the creative level it was getting a little crowded inside for these successful and capable musicians. At some point (The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway was the final moment of it) there were enough composers in that band to keep 4 bands well and alive. Peter Gabriel was the first of this group to announce his departure (most likely because the obsession of fans with his persona was unjustand started to create harmful energy on the inside). The next one was Steve Hackett whose solo albums have been coming to us for over 30 years now, with the newest one being released in a few days. Tony Banks was another composer whose talents are very visible on TLLDOB. Phil Collins does not need any introduction. Genesis was one of the most influential bands of my life, starting with their first album From Genesis To Revelation (1969) (although I did not know this album until much later) through Trespass (1970), Nursery Crime (1971), Foxtrot (1972), Selling England By The Pound (1973), The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway (1974), A Trick Of The Tail (1976), Wind And Wuthering (1976), And Then There We Three (1978) to Duke (1980) and Abacab (1981). Some of my favorite songs by Genesis are the following: Supper Is Ready, Hairless Heart, Counting Out Time, The Carpet Crawlers, Dancing With The Moonlit Knight, Where The Sour Turns To Sweet, Snowbound, One For The Vine, Lover's Leap, Anyway, Undertow, The Musical Box, Horizon's, In Hiding, Many Too Many, Firth Of Fifth, Fly On The Windshield, Broadway Melody Of 1974, Cuckoo Cocoon.and started to create harmful energy on the inside).

B00005JMYI|5.0|When Anchorman came into theaters, I had just turned 13. I was finally old enough to see a PG-13 movie. Most of the jokes were way over my head, but still hilarious. Now when I watch it, I literally have tears running down my face. Anchorman tells the simplistic story of an acclaimed, arrogant news anchor, Ron Burgundy. Burgundy must adapt to his new partner, Veronica Corningstone, who is an attractive female actress. Like any Will Ferrell movie, the content and story line isn't award-winning but the jokes, one-lines, dry humor, unforgettable cameos and the quirkiness of Ferrell and his cast.
B0007MVXQG|4.0|I'll start this out by commenting that I quite like Priest, but I'm not a HUGE fan - hence only 4 stars (I'd do 4 1/2 if I could).  This is a really good album, but not in the league of Iron Maiden's, Blind Guardian's, Deep Purple's best in my opinion.  I'd say if you like Judas Priest as much or better than the aforementioned bands, consider this a 5-star review.       There's a 13-minute epic on \\"Loch Ness\\"; while Priest have done some longer songs, they're not really known for doing the grand epics that are Iron Maiden's signature.  Well, it's pretty cool, but not brilliant.  And that's what keeps the last star off for me - the album ranges from pretty good to really good metal, but doesn't really cross over into that brilliant/amazing zone of my favorite albums.    I think it's every bit as good as \\"Sad Wings\\", \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\", or \\"Painkiller\\" - the songs are well written, it rocks, Halford is one of the few metal singers who doesn't seem to have lost any vocal abilities over a long career (or, if he has, he knows how to sing so you don't notice - see the aforementioned Maiden and Purple for singers who, while still great, aren't what they used to be).  I'd like to commend them for keeping Roy Z (who also produced Halford's recent solo work) - he worked for Dickenson also to great effect, and Maiden made the wrong move in producer/engineers by NOT using him when they reuinited with Bruce.  So, \\"Angel of Retribution\\" has a much better sound than (for example) Maiden's recent work - I don't find myself thinking \\"pretty good for old-timers\\" - it's unqualifyingly as good as their heyday, something few bands can claim.      One of the things I admire about Judas Priest is that they can move with the times without losing their identity or quality - they have some albums that are weaker and some that are stronger, but they're about the only band I can think of where these are spread evenly throughout their career - most bands have a \\"heyday\\" of maybe 5 (10 for the best) years, a few weaker albums before, and a long decline after.  Most bands, if they have a good album late in the career, it's really not as good as their heyday; they're lacking in energy or creativity or somewhat repeating themselves, but I don't have that impression of Judas Priest - I would confidentally recommend this to a new fan wanting to check out the band at their best.    So, yeah, if you like classic metal or Judas Priest, you should enjoy this.     I do agree, though, with other reviewers that point out the flaws of the \\"dualdisc\\" format and the hardcover book special edition.  I wish CD companies could just stick with the old tried-and-true method of making regular CDs that play in every player and putting them in sturdy jewel cases that protect the disc (and I can open with one hand in the car, where I tend to do a lot of my rockin' out).  But, I'll also add that the dualdisc edition I have plays fine in my crappy car CD player, which usually has a problem with burnt, slightly scratched, and even long (over 70 min.) CDs that regular CD players play fine.

B002PMV9FG|1.0|What is it about Harry Potter movies that make them so unmemorable?  Obviously it can't be the source material.  The beloved series by J.K. Rowling is pure magic, no pun intended.  Still, as a fan of the books, I watch each film, excited each time around to see the story of Harry Potter unfold on the big screen.  I'm not sure what I'm expecting from these films.  I mean, they are adaptions of a book.  In my opinion, books are always better than their movie counterparts.  The Lord of the Rings trilogy might be the only exception in my mind, but that's another story.    What has frustrated me about the movies are the missed opportunities, and I'm not even talking about scenes from the books that didn't make the films.  Here's an example:    In Order of the Phoenix, the climactic battle at the end of the film between the Death Eaters and The Order culminates in the timely arrival of Dumbledore.  In the book, this is nothing short of a \\"Gandalf On A White Horse\\" moment.  He arrives as the battle seems lost, and kicks some serious tail. In the film, he walks out of a fireplace like he just woke up from a nap.    In this latest film, The Half-blood Prince, we see more of the same.  Once again, a battle sequence at the end of the book finds all hell breaking loose at Hogwarts, after Dumbledore... well... You know.  Instead the Death Eaters just casually walk out of the school, as if it were a passing period.  What makes this an even greater insult is that the filmmakers decide to add a scene that wasn't in the book, and frankly, serves NO PURPOSE.  The \\"Attack On The Burrow\\", as it has come to be known, makes no sense.  It accomplishes nothing.  It doesn't advance the plot.    The filmmakers have one more chance to get it right with the Deathly Hallows.      I really hope they do.
B001974DG0|4.0|I can't exactly say I was being sucked in at first. Half expecting a story for children (from some other reviews) I encountered a story for adults. Koontz uses a very peculiar style, the narrative structure seems improvised, there's no rhythm, the words seem to be just there to convey a story, they don't seem to form patterns. Many occurrences seem to be overly optimistic or even naive, some lines are downward cheesy. If I didn't know better (just looked up Koontz's bibliography) I would attribute this novel to a young and inexperienced author. Yet I enjoyed the whole book, devouring it in just two days, so if you're patient the story will deliver.
B002UXRH10|5.0|Rihanna truly is a great artist. This album displays some of her best work. It's a bit of a step in a new direction, but I still love it. My fav track on the album is \\"Hard.\\" This is def a must buy...
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|i completely agree. I am a HUGE fan of Alicia Keys and she has never let me down. She is so talented and I believe her raw-est and true-est talent still has not been delivered. The songs \\"love is blind\\", \\" Love is the disease\\", and \\"un-thinkable\\" are already some of my favorites. I highly recommend her album. HIGHLY! I'm pleased. Thank you, Alicia.
B00003CX95|5.0|Braveheart is a GREAT movie!!!! But we specifically searched out a full-screen edition to order. And when it arrived it was WIDE-SCREEN!!! It was sent from one of Amazon's affiliates, and when we contacted them, they said they would send me a return label, and refund my money in the bank in 3 to 4 weeks. Told me they couldn't give me a full-screen, I would have to reorder all over if I wanted full-screen, and it was not availble at that time. And the paper it was sent in maybe cheaper for the shipper, but the cases get broken in the mail. Because Braveheart and I just recieved Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, and both cases were broken. I would suggest if you don't have the movie in the format the person wants, don't offer it.                      Roger L. Heath
B000YABIQ6|5.0|After I watched the first episode, I couldn't wait for the rest.  Mad Men takes you into the crazy world of Madison Avenue in the late 1950s-early 1960s -- a time when everyone smoked and drank all the time, sex in the office was rampant, and bored suburban wives worried as their husbands bedded their secretaries.  While it's a bit of an exaggeration, the amazing thing is (and I am old enough to remember) that there is a lot of truth in the picture that is so skillfully drawn by this series.  The acting is terrific and the use of music is really excellent.  Recommend!
B002RSDW80|5.0|Julie was a fan of Julia's and oh how similar their lives turned out to be. Both married to great guys, both working on writing something that seemed impossible at the time and both loving cooking. I really enjoyed this movie.  I loved how the two stories were intertwined and edited together, the time flew by. Ms Streep became Julia and gave a stellar performance. Amy Adams was also very good as the down-trodden NYC worker that worshipped Julia. Julie's blog fans, inturn, made her writing a hit as well.   I had no idea about the backstory of Julia  and enjoyed the look at France and the McCarthy era from fresh eyes. Fun, fresh and something completely different. My husband even loved it (being a foodie helped!) Would make a great gift for the chef in your life.
B0002S947K|5.0|Excellent--I bought this to hear the entire song of that neat Traveler's Insurance commercial with the little white dog.  Tunes are great, CD came within three days and I'm happy!
B002Y5210G|4.0|Elements of Freedom is not perfect but had quite a few songs that moved me which is more than I can say for most of the crap that has come out lately and constantly played on the radio. What I appreciated is not every song is a love song on this album. There are inspirational songs too.     For me the album officially starts with Track#4 'Try Sleeping With a Broken Heart'. This song was composed by Alicia herself and the lyrics are basic but mean so much.     Track #5 'Wait Til You See Me Smile' sounds like it could be the ending theme to a feel good movie. That song sure made me feel that way and Alicia composed this song herself.     Track #6 'That's How Strong My Love Is' made me cry. Her lyrics in this song summed up how some of us females feel about our men but can't find the words to express it. And Alicia composed this one also.     Tracks #7, 8, and 9 are okay but didn't move me like the songs I previously mentioned. These songs made me bob my head and I didn't turn from them and have a traditional Alicia Keys feel to them.     Track #10 'Put it in a Love Song' the Beyonce and Alicia Keys collaboration annoyed me. It would seem two best selling artist could come up with something better than that artificial sounding mess. But I noticed Beyonce was listed as the composer on that song.... hmmm 'nough said!     Track #11 'This Bed' is catchy and has a different sound to it than one would expect Alicia Keys to do, an almost 80s feel to it.     Alicia composed Track #12 'Distance and Time'. It is traditional Alicia Keys, but felt redundant of 'Like you'll Never See Me Again' from the AS I AM album but just not as good.     Track #13 'How It Feels to Fly' is a nice feel good and inspirational track.     Lastly, Track #14 'Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down' sounds great! I'm not a fan of rap and I already liked how 'Empire State of Mind part I' sounded, so having Alicia fill in the rap parts with her awesome voice and even more piano playing made the songreally cool!     Now I was disappointed that Alicia didn't do one of her famous instrumental openings like she has done with all her other albums but that's only a minor thing. Overall there are 9 tracks that in my opinion are worth listening to and 5 of those tracks are really nice and puts Elements of Freedom in a different category than other albums that have came out within the past few months. And unlike what a couple of reviewers have said, this album is not a typical pop sound cause for one it's RnB and secondly it doesn't sound like everyone else's stuff(with the exception of 'Put it in a Love Song').     If you like to feel good about yourself and are an Alicia Keys fan I highly recommend this album cause I guarantee you'll like more than one song and getting those tracks individually will cost you more than the album's price. If you are pessimistic and like to complain about everything please don't bother listening to this album. Negativity can be contagious and only those who want to be happy can(track #5).
B001H5X7I4|5.0|A great and very funny movie to own. A group of famous actors who put their all into creating a very funny movie.
B000ZELISO|4.0|The movie is what it is and the debates and comments will go on.<br /><br />What I am reviewing is this particular disk package.<br /><br />This package has a BluRay disk, a DVD disk and a digital copy that can be downloaded for a windows media player or on Itunes.  I love the fact that with one package I can cover all three types of media I play regularly.  My biggest objection is the size of the digital copy for I-Tunes.  I own a IPod touch and space becomes quiet valuable.  This is a rather large file but does look great on my Ipod Touch.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I loved this CD. Susan Boyle had the nerve and talent to sing Streisand's \\"Cry Me a River\\" and did it wonderfully!!! I like the wide selection of songs. All were done extremely well. I couldn't wait for this CD to come out, and it was as good as I thought it would be.
0810993139|2.0|The main character in this book, Greg, is not what I expected - he is not a wimpy child that is picked upon by the other students. In many of the episodes related here, Greg is the person who is doing the bullying. Greg torments his younger brother, chases small children with worms, throws apples to disrupt the school play and treats his \\"friends\\" shamefully.    In his blog, Jeff Kinney, the author/artist, says that \\"Greg is self-centered and he can be kind of clueless. I don't think he is a bad kid, necessarily; but like all of us, he has his faults... I think that stories with characters who always do the right thing are a little boring.\\" The problem is that Greg NEVER does the right thing, he IS a bad kid. He is mean, selfish, lazy and pretty stupid too. I kept waiting for the moments of redemption, when he apologized for his actions, or attempted some kind of restitution for his bad behavior. But Greg is unrepentant throughout, Jeff Kinney never lets Greg show the least amount of courage; Greg has no conscience. Greg is impossible to like.    I happen to just finish reading a novel called \\"The Greatest Thing Since Sliced Bread\\" which features another young protagonist, the eleven year old Morris Bird III. Morris is not perfect, he steals, he skips out of class - but Morris DOES have a conscience, he is a real likable character. The contrast between Morris and Greg is dramatic. One boy you can cheer for, the other is a hopeless delinquent.    The only reason I did not give this book a single star is that Kinney has done a marvelous job with his artwork. Using deceptively simple line art, Kinney manages to impart personality and unique facial features on each of his characters. All of the actors are immediately recognizable, its just too bad that none of them are likable.    Try covering up the artwork on a few pages, and just read the words, and you will realize how the drawings make the whole book palatable. If the line art is deleted, and you read the text only, you would realize how awful Greg is. Ugh.
B002KDUDG6|2.0|I'm not sure who Michael Buble is trying to be, but his music becomes damn annoying this time of year as it is piped into shopping malls and played at the office during the Yuletide season.  As such, I got a chance to hear his latest offering and was none too impressed.  He has a smooth enough voice but it is pure affectation, little of the humor, much less presence, of those he has taken his songs from.  Of course, one doesn't expect crooners like Buble to write his own material, rather offer mundane interpretations of classic standards.  Very sad to hear Van Morrison's Crazy Love made into an ersatz elevator song.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This Movie is wonderful in High Definition quality and different from standard definition.  I suggest to all fans of Star Trek in all over world is buy it on Blu Ray.    Bye.
B002T9H2L0|1.0|I absolutely cannot understand why people are so in love with Tarantino's cut 'n' paste vision of cinema.  He blatantly rips off those he claims to admire, and winds up making the same sadistic revenge flick over and over and over.  The latest incarnation is 'Inglourious Basterds,' in which a bunch of murderous people on both sides compete to see who can commit the bigger atrocities.  The first scene?  Oh, the tension THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE HAD I NOT ALREADY SEEN THIS IN DOZENS OF MOVIES.  And can we stop with the idiotic chapters, especially those that begin \\"Once Upon a Time In...\\", Quentin?  You're not Sergio Leone, and you never will be.    The premise that Nazi Germany, losing the war, decides to abandon any pretense at security and have Hitler attend a film premiere in Paris?  I'm sorry, this is not alternate reality - it is complete fantasy, as are the completely shambolic schemes to kill Hitler by both the Basterds and the woman who runs the theater, both of which would have been thwarted by Paul Blart, Mall Cop.    Tarantino also likes to simply throw in bits of Morricone, and even a snippet of Lalo Schifrin's score for \\"Kelly's Heroes\\" (an INFINITELY better movie about guys who decide to go for themselves in wartime) to make the so-called cinephiles excited.  I don't know - maybe the guy doesn't want to pay an actual composer, or maybe composers don't want to work for him, because he's telling him, \\"I want something like the 'Tiger Tank' theme from \\"Kelly's Heroes\\" here,\\" all the time.    This movie is a complete mess, with nothing memorable about the characters, plot, or music, except that which has been ripped off from other movies.  Certainly the so-called Basterds themselves come off as cutout thugs out for a revenge murder spree.  And one final point -- I'm not sure why I'm supposed to be terrified of some unseen retard repeatedly swinging a bat against the walls of a cave.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|- The special effects are interesting.    - The character development is so good that I can't take my eyes off the screen until the end of the movie.    - The action is exciting.    Warning: DO NOT READ the FOLLOWING if you HAVE NOT WATCHED the MOVIE    - There are quite a few touching scenes. For example, while crashing his ship to the enemy, the first captain said goodbye to his newly-born infant and his wife.   The other is when the second captain could not save his mother.     It's one of the best science fiction movie released in 2009. I own it.    P.S On Sunday, Mar 7th, 2010, this movie received an Oscar award for Best Makeup.
B000BB1MI2|1.0|I'll preface by saying I'm not a huge fan of Depp. I find his whimsical pseudo-insane persona in most of his movies off-putting. However, this really was a worthless movie.    Here is what I recall from the original charlie and the chocolate factory:  - fun  - interesting  - light-hearted    Here is what is in this version:  - dark  - awkward  - somewhat scary (for kids)    I have nothing against good remakes but Gene Wilder in the original played an interesting and likable, if very quirky, guy. Frankly, Depp has a bit of a pedo vibe in this and in any case he is patently unlikeable and actually nasty. His factory is less like a fun place and more like a demented candy house. It scared my young kids a bit. That is ok, they are young, but as an adult there is no reason at all to watch this over the original.     And so, it's like \\"upgrading\\" from A Lexus to a Kia. Skip this waste of time and go with the original. This offers *nothing* but updated special effects.    One of the big networks is playing Charlie and the Chocolate factory on TV in the next week or so--the original, thankfully. They know this remake is without merit.
1594481717|1.0|Average reviewer rating of four and half stars notwithstanding, anyone interested in this should read the negative reviews. I wish I did.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|Alicia Keys' voice has grown so much over these years that no one can deny it. And that's not to say she was a bad singer to begin with. It's just that in this album, she's strong with the vibrato, beautifully executing 5th register notes and hitting those runs like a track star. Her voice is wonderfully maturing. I definitely feel that with this album she sings with passion like nothing else. There are mostly mid-tempo songs with whimsical strings, crazy piano melodies, lovely chord progressions, strong vocals(of course), with hot drums for the rythym.    9/10 Empire State of Mind- great sequel to the first; I just wish she could've re-worked the hook and toned it down until she got to the end, when the music actually grows in texture and rhythm    10/10 How It Feels to Fly- great inspirational song, with a powerful choir at then end that when played in theatre will definitately take your breath away.    7/10 Distance and Time- this song is okay. I tend to skip it alot though. It just doesn't get it for me. Nothing about this song stands out.    10/10 This Bed- nice adult contemporary R&B field, circa Prince with the falsetto nights. Great song.    7/10 Like the Sea- I love the piano melody and the heavy drums; a bit faster than mid tempo; nice.    10/10 Love is My Disease- this is a beautiful song; reggae-esque chord progressions and base but it's very subtle. I think I notice right off bat because of my love for music. very passionate lead and background vocals.    10/10 Un-thinkable- this is another one of those fabulous mellow contemporary R&B works. It's the PERFECT song in the background to play when you bring your date home from a night out.    4/10 Put It in a Love Song- this is one song that I really don't like; it has Beyonce and big weave written all over it. It's completely shallow subject material and that is SOOOO not Alicia. And I understand experimenting but this \\"Put a ring on sound\\" is lame. I didn't like when Beyonce did so...go figure.    10/10That's How Strong My Love is- the most BEAUTIFUL song on this album. enough said.    6/10 Wait Til You See My Smile- very cute lyrics but not particulary a stand out.    10/10 Try Sleeping and  8/10 Doesn't Mean Anything- of course I'm sure you guys have heard these songs already. They're still great, especially Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart...    10/10 Love is Blind- reminds me a 70s R&B and this song JAMS especially with great stereo speakers. It's slow tempo; almost like a song that you could smoke a joint to (not that I would know anything about that) but it's a GREAT song.
1591396190|5.0|Great book to opening your mind to a different way of thinking and making creative business decisions

B000RPTQ1C|1.0|Anytime you start an album with an instrumental track, you really need to deliver.  If you are insanely talented, it might work; otherwise, it comes across as self-indulgent.  All the tracks seem to mosey along and there is really nothing there to grab one's attention or make Coldplay stand out from all the other U2, radiohead, DMB, wannabes out there.  I guess I need to approach any Brian Eno produced records with caution in the future.  At least I only paid $7.98 total for it (one of the Black Friday lightning deals) so I only feel ripped off by Coldplay and not by Coldplay and Amazon.
B000001IMW|5.0|This one was, is and will remain 1 of the top 5 albums ever made IMO.  I've owned it since way back in the 80s and I've worn out numerous copies and always replace them immediately.  Shoot, its in my CD changer right now.  There just aren't enough words to describe how great this thing is...its heavy, ironic, comic, punk, brilliant... I mean just so incredible.  The only problem with it is that it ends to quick.  Do not hestitate.
0375854819|5.0|I loved this series.  They are well written, entertaining, and quite engrossing.  I would recommend them to anyone. I have passed my books on to be read by many more people.
B00102F5WK|4.0|I liked this movie, I thought it was compelling. As I expected though, there were some on the right who called this movie unamerican and anti-american in their reviews. This is to be expected though. Though quite a number of conservatives share the concern of those on the left for the use harsh interrogations means (and sending prisoners/detainees to nations such as Egypt where we know they will use torture to acquire information is definately one of them) quite a number on the right don't really share these concerns. Which is most ironic, because it is the far right that usually states (often because of deep religious convictions) that it has absolutely moral truth and authority. Often this supposedly comes from the deity they worship. So, if you support the practices depicted in this film then you lose that \\"absolute moral authority/truth/ rightness\\" that you have. It is the left who much more then the right who are principled when it comes opposition to the use of torture or torture lite. Which is most ironic, since they are said not to have a moral compass or that they practice moral relativism. Again, this is not to say to be very religious or even conservative one can't oppose torture or \\"harsh interrogation\\" but all too often the more religious one is, the more one supports these things.  Lastly, I fully expect to be called unamerican or some variant of it, on someone's comments, because that is what unfortunately far too many people who can't defend their position without emotion, resort to very frequently. This film is pro-American, it stands for American values of due process and freedom from being tortured by the state. It lives up to America's highest ideals.
0061231401|5.0|I'm not sure why I waited so long to read this book. Normally when a new Rollins is released I'm at the store the same day. Perhaps it was because I was afraid the goodness couldn't last forever, but I should have had better faith in Mr. Rollins. The Doomsday Key was fabulous. It contains all the necessary ingredients for a successful sm&ouml;rgåsbord of action-adventure-thriller-suspense entertainment. There are certain criteria you need for an endeavor like this: the good guys, the bad guys, comedic relief (oh, Kowalski), conspiracy rooted in historical truth (popes and prophecies), gunfights and explosions, caves, caves that cave in, a deadly disease, a finger in a leather bag with ancient symbols burned on the outside, a good dosing of betrayal, some stone circles and smelly peat bogs, oh and a few cliffhangers thrown in for good measure. It's all here!<br /><br />This time around, Sigma is back to work with a shadowy double agent operative named Seichan who also works with the Guild (see: bad guys). We still don't know if Seichan is true to us (and by us I mean Sigma, of course) or if she's just out for her own benefit. Either way, if Commander Gray Pierce doesn't work with her, the whole world could be taken over by a nasty spore; a fungus that grows mushrooms inside of you.<br /><br />Yeah, gross.<br /><br />Doomsday is the sixth Sigma novel, and it could be my favorite. Sometimes after the first few books in a series an author teeters out, the books become formulaic and predictable, but Doomsday is none of these. This one is more mature than its predecessors; I even got teary at one point toward the end. Not to mention there was so much information related to true historical facts that my head was spinning, and I came out the other side smarter for it. Google Saint Malachy and his prophecies, or the legend of the Black Madonna, or colony collapse disorder, and you'll see what I mean; but you won't understand how they all go together until you read this book. It really makes you think... if the facts and details used to make a plot are real, what if Rollins' theories as put down in fiction are actually true? And that, that right there, is why I love his books. I suggest you run your person out to the closest book store and start with Sandstorm (Sigma prequel) and work your way up from there.<br /><br />5 stars. His next book is not Sigma, but I love his individual adventures too, so I can't wait for the Altar of Eden on December 29.k... if the facts and details used to make a plot are real, what if Rollins' theories as put down in fiction are actually true?

0765322889|5.0|(I wrote the following in response to a discussion topic question below, and since I hadn't even written a review yet, decided to copy it here as it says what I feel about this book and it's sequels. The question was from someone who had read the first 50 pages and wanted spoilers to decide whether to continue.)<br /><br />Felt that way about the first few pages also, and put it down a couple times to read other books, like Roger Zelazny's Amber Series and John Scalzi's Old Man's War trilogy. Amber is up there, for me, with Tolkein. Before I finally read Gardens of the Moon, my next faves were George RR Martin's Song of Fire and Ice series, and of course Robert Jordan's first three Wheel of Time books. Well, I'm now in book 6 of The Malazan Book of the Fallen series, just 2 months after reading Gardens of the Moon, and it's the best fantasy series I have ever read. It just gets better with every book. New stuff in each but the main story carries on, as do the main characters. The books' cover pages, with people like Stephen Donaldson comparing Steven Erikson to Tolkein, are not exaggerations. Plus the books are 1000+ pages, and he's written 9 or 10 now. An epic fantasy lover's dream come true. And again, every book gets even better than the previous.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. If you like the books by the great authors mentioned above, you must read Gardens of the Moon.<br /><br />The characters you have been introduced to in the first 50 pages will be around from now on. So much happens to them, you won't believe. If you've read about the Hounds decimating the Malazan troops outside of Pale, I'm surprised you are not hooked already. The seemingly bad guys who control the hounds and take the girl are actually good guys in a very complex way, and it's very surprising who they really are. The girl is a major character for the entire series. Most characters take a book off while Erikson enters another area of the complex world and introduces new ones, but they all interact at some point in the incredibly sweeping panorama. This is all a developing saga that while complex, all ties in. It's a book about wars between mortals but with the immortals and almost-immortals playing the most prominent roles.<br /><br />Erikson's character development is unparalleled. The action is non-stop. The sorcery is more prominent and stronger than you've ever read before, yet the ordinary mortals are the most interesting characters. Gods walk among the living. Demons are friends as well as foes. The humor is laugh out loud funny at times. The shock of the violent death of a favorite character, that you never thought would die, will really get to you. Erikson is like Martin in that sense, but you really like Erikson's characters, versus ambivalence for many of Martin's.<br /><br />More specific spoilers? No, won't go there.

1416550542|5.0|Kate Morton has magnificently written a breathtaking multi-generational family saga rich with secrets, history, mystery and fairytales.  Told by weaving in and out of three women's lives over three time periods...Eliza (early 1900's), Nell (1970's), and Cassandra (present 2005)...each containing a piece of the puzzle towards the true identity of Nell.  Found in 1913 aboard a ship sailing from England to Australia, young Nell was abandoned carrying only a small suitcase by someone she vaguely remembers as the Authoress.  Adopted by a loving Australian family, at 21 she learns of her unknown ancestry.  Using a fairy tale book written by Eliza Makepeace from the suitcase as a starting point, she travels to England to find her true identity.  Fast forward to the present when granddaughter, Cassandra, inherits a mysterious English cottage after Nell dies.  Following the footsteps of her grandmother, Cassandra continues the search for Nell's history.  The engaging mystery unfolds through the lives of Eliza, Nell, and Cassandra.     Ms. Morton is truly a gifted storyteller who has masterfully created three intriguing, enthralling storylines and brilliantly intertwined them together.  Her eloquent, evocative writing beautifully brings each scene to life and wonderfully captures the ambiance of that particular time and place.  The strong, compelling female characters thoroughly captivated me in the opening pages and never let go.  Ms. Morton marvelously embellishes the story with the magic of Eliza Makepeace's enchanting fairy tales scattered throughout.  I absolutely loved this thoroughly entertaining book and I highly recommend it!
B002RV01QI|5.0|As a devoted Enya fan, this album, which has 19 tracts, has only one song which is not on any of the 11 other of her albums in my collection...Aniron (which alone is almost worth the price of the album).  The producers seem to have \\"cleaned up\\" the acoustics and popped the bass so these tracts seem to be brighter and richer in this album.  These are not all of Enya's best songs, in my opinion, but this album is a very good start.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I think I feel the same way a lot of people feel.<br />I know our meat sources don't exactly come from good places but like a lot of people I just wanted to turn a blind eye. Just give me my meat and be quiet.<br />So after some hard thinking I decided to watch \\"Food Inc.\\" and I think I can sum up the movie and the meat industry in one word.<br />EWWWWWWWWWWW!!!<br /><br />I won't go into great detail as to what the movie involves; other reviewers have done that already and done it well.<br /><br />What did I like about the movie?<br />Everything!<br />I think I'm ready to start ordering my meat through an organic farmer; I don't want all those chemicals and hormones going through my body or my families.<br />The movie is well shot, well written, and very informative.<br />Eye opening and flat out disturbing.<br />Why is the food industry doing this to us?<br />Why are they doing such terrible things to the animals?<br />What are they doing?<br />Watch the movie and find out.<br />It's sad, I almost had to turn the movie off after the story of the two year old and E Coli.<br />What else did I like?<br />I can't believe I'm saying this about a documentary but I loved the music too.<br />Great acoustic guitar in certain spots.<br /><br />What didn't I like?<br />Nothing.<br />This movie is as perfect as a documentary can be.<br />If you're at all curious as to where or meat is REALLY coming from and if you think by not eating meat that you're any safer, THINK AGAIN.<br />You owe it to yourself and your loved ones to watch this movie.<br />Get informed and take action.<br />If you won't stand up for your own health, no one will.<br />Food Inc. comes......<br />Highly Recommended!!!
B002R0F3Q2|4.0|Alicia Keys is a music artist I've followed since her debut and thus far she has not disappointed me.  With her previous release, AS I AM, Alicia dabbled in a kind of throwback '70s pop/soul sound that worked on some tracks and didn't on others.  Overall I thought it was a great concept album and enjoyed the music.<br /><br />For this album I'd hoped that she would have a greater balance between soulful tunes vs pop tunes but this collection is an ecclectic mix of tracks that stray even farther away from the soul songstress we were introduced to with her debut SIAM.  It's not a bad thing because as a fan of music I love to see someone grow with each album and try different sounds especially when that artist has such a strong sense of direction and musicality as Alicia.<br /><br />I got my copy last night and after only 1 listen immediately fell in love with 7 songs:<br /><br />UNTHINKABLE (I'M READY) - this is a slow grinder featuring Drake on background vocals.  I love the beats & she sounds incredible;<br /><br />THIS BED - another homage to the inimitable Prince.  This is a very catchy midtempo track reminiscent of an '80s Prince track;<br /><br />THAT'S HOW STRONG MY LOVE IS - melodically pretty track with gorgeous lyrics;<br /><br />HOW IT FEELS TO FLY - another melodically pretty track featuring a choir during the ending chorus;<br /><br />EMPIRE STATE OF MIND - PT II (BROKEN DOWN) - really nice stripped down version of her hit duet with Jay-Z; the last two are the bonus tracks:<br /><br />LOVER MAN - a grinder/sexy track & WE'RE ALMOST THERE - production reminds me of an old school Jackson 5 mashed with Marvin Gaye track, vocally she sounds great on this one.<br /><br />Of course I've already heard and really enjoy both of her single releases:<br />TRY SLEEPING WITH A BROKEN HEART - which is a track that I imagine could've been on AS I AM, it has that same 70s pop feel that that whole album had & DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING - another heartfelt ballad that escapes being cheesy because of her soulful performance.<br /><br />Growers - songs that didn't initially resonate with me but I find interesting are: LOVE IS BLIND - the vocals sound nothing like AKeys which threw me the first few times I listened to this track but the more I listen to it, the more I began to appreciate her taking a risk on a different type of sound; WAIT TILL YOU SEE MY SMILE - same comment as for LIB; LOVE IS MY DISEASE - subtle reggae beat along with her straining sounding vocals during the chorus add to the urgency of the song & it's lyrics - not totally unpleasant to hear but it's taking a while to grow on me; PUT IT IN A LOVE SONG - the hyped duet with Beyonce..it's a catchy track that I'm sure will get massive play and eventually a video.  It's a different sound for AKeys and definitely sounds more like a typical Beyonce track.<br /><br />I strongly dislike: LIKE THE SEA - innane lyrics and strange musical production, could not get into this track at all & DISTANCE & TIME - very blah track, no soul or urgency. it has a pretty melody and lyrics but BLAH! I didn't connect to this track at all.<br /><br />Overall I'm enjoying listening to this set and think it's on par with AS I AM in terms of the sound and where Alicia seems to be going musically.  I don't think it's a step back but it's not a set that exceeds what she has done in the past on her last albums either.  As a fan, I am very happy with the 7 songs I mentioned above as those that I loved instantly and find the growers interesting enough NOT to skip as I listen.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this disc to fans because if you like her music there is enough diversity between the tracks that I'm sure you'll enjoy more than a few tracks and suggest that non-fans sample tracks to see which tracks they like first.ongs that didn't initially resonate with me but I find interesting are: LOVE IS BLIND - the vocals sound nothing like AKeys which threw me the first few times I listened to this track but the more I listen to it, the more I began to appreciate her taking a risk on a different type of sound; WAIT TILL YOU SEE MY SMILE - same comment as for LIB; LOVE IS MY DISEASE - subtle reggae beat along with her straining sounding vocals during the chorus add to the urgency of the song & it's lyrics - not totally unpleasant to hear but it's taking a while to grow on me; PUT IT IN A LOVE SONG - the hyped duet with Beyonce..it's a catchy track that I'm sure will get massive play and eventually a video.

0307387178|4.0|I have not read all the Amazon reviews of this book but I highly suspect that most admitted a strange but powerful fascination with  Christopher---a fascination that kept some awake reading until they completely finished the book. I'm not going to sugar-coat it. I probably kept reading partly because I wanted to see whether this boy dies or not in the end. I wanted to see if he died for his rash choices.  Did I mourn for him? A little, but I also felt a sort of contempt which was likely not fair in view of the fact that I did not know what was in Christopher's mind---what smarter plan he might have had which went wrong somewhere along the way. I surely can't believe that he had a death wish. However, he was an extremely idealistic young man who believed so much in his philosophy, in living off the land free and wild, I can't say with 100 percent certainty what he would have done if he could now look back and change his destiny. Would he immediately take back what he did?  One would expect and hope so. But, think about it, if this had not occurred, would there be any chance that his life and all he stood for would have been recognized worldwide? How much would he have valued the universal recognition? Was his idealism strong enough that he could have accepted his fate in exchange for the incredible notoriety--a reputation as a young person who braved the wilderness, who struggled valiantly to survive alone with Nature and failed but failed with all he had to give?<br /><br />I don't think Krakauer purposely profited by propagandizing this young man's story. I think he had that irresistible urge that almost all journalists to tell a very compelling story, and he decided to go for it. Any of us writers might have done the same thing had we the opportunity. I can't be the one to cast stones.
B0001GMIOE|1.0|Buyer beware of reduced-price \\"canon\\" batteries. Do a little research to determine you're buying a genuine canon. I was suspicious after receiving two I could just pop out of the sealed \\"official\\" packaging and they had misspelled words imprinted on the backs. I had read something about this online and felt safer returning them. Fortunately the Amazon Marketplace sellers I used were very good about refunds.
B000002897|4.0|way underrated, 'Sweet Oblivion' is ferocious and melodic.  'Julie Paradise' is one of the finest songs to come out of seattle, or anywhere else for that matter, during the 1990's.
141694737X|5.0|My older daughter LOVED this book as a baby and continues to enjoy it at 3 years old.  My younger daughter, now 1, loves this as well and it's one of her favorites.  Similar to what a previous poster said, this oddly is the ONLY lift-the-flap book that has not had flaps torn out of it... by either kid!  Granted #2 is still young and may tear one out tomorrow.  In that case I will buy a second copy :)
B002HWRZH0|5.0|I am a die hard Star Trek fan and the \\"franchise\\" is alive and well even though the movie changes history.  The special affects is of course cuting edge and viewing the movie on blu-ray just gives you nothing but sharp, colorful scene after scene.  If you are into action, this movie packs it in from beginning to end.  The cast was well picked and deliver their lines and scenes well.  This movie helps re-establishes the characters we all know and love as well as showing us a bit more of their lives before the Star Trek origin series.  Even if you are not a serious Star Trek fan, you will enjoy this movie even though you most likely won't like the changes in some of the history.  Overall as I stated for the title of this review, it is entertaining.  The Enterprise replica is nice to have especially if you are a Star Trek collector.
B002H3F7F6|3.0|I have no problems with the Cd, but the packaging is cardboard and flimsy.  I cut it up and put in in a hard plastic case like it should have been in the first place.
B002NXSRVG|3.0|This movie takes whatever fond childhood memory I've had of G.I. Joe and gives it a mean hurtful wedgie. I went to see this one months ago and, based on that crapalicious trailer (ya know, the one with the armored suits), I wasn't expecting to be overwhelmed. Or even whelmed. This movie doesn't aim too high, and so it hits its target audience. G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA is what it is - a big budget summertime popcorn flick in which the big dogs figured that as long as it's slick and peopled with cool and beautiful actors and chock full of dazzling and eardrum-shattering effects, then that'll do for the sheep. The critics showered it with hate. And, sheepishly, I wasn't as turned off as I maybe should've been. I'm giving it a generous 3 stars out of 5, thanks to the inner kid in me which may be not cool with what's been done here but, on the other hand, is just grateful that G.I. Joe finally made it to the big screen as a live action picture.<br /><br />Odds are, any movie featuring a Wayans brother instantly surrenders busloads of credibility. This one lost a few more points with me once Marlon Wayons started mugging for the camera. I give the writers credit for trying to come up with a story from the ground level up, this by having Duke and Ripcord introduced as fresh recruits to this elite military team. This gives us two point-of-view characters to identify with. There's a lot of stuff going on. The movie depends on the audiences' childhood familiarity with the characters to pull them thru all the hectic.<br /><br />The plot is big and bloated, the dialogue is dumbed down, the action sequences a showcase for big budget excesses. What's missing is heart and, okay, a solid script and enough actors who can sell the storyline. It's a bit damning that, for me, the two most absorbing characters happen to be the black ninja with the vow of silence and the vampy bespectacled villainess. I guess, for the lead, they tried to find a stud who was hip and smoove and relatable, and Tatum Channing must've fit the bill. But I feel that he was miscast as Duke, that he lacks the necessary acting chops and that sense of solidity and resolve, despite all claims from his buddy Wayans that \\"Duke wasn't born, he was government-issued.\\" Tatum Channing sleepwalks thru this one, and one wonders what Sam Worthington would've done with this role (it was offered to Worthington but dude had to do AVATAR). And, as for Marlon Wayans, well, there he is, standing there just being a Wayans. We really could've done with more of Dennis Quaid's General Hawk. Good thing, then, that the guy is signed on for two sequels.<br /><br />The story is set somewhen \\"in the not too distant future,\\" which then allows for some pretty impressive future tech from both the good guys and the bad. The Joes, for example, flaunt a coat enabling extreme camouflage and clunky one-man armors called Delta 6 Accelerator Suits (the unconvincing demonstration of which seriously cheesed me off). The McGuffin of the movie are frightfully corrosive nanomites which can dissolve metal in mere moments. This frightening weapon is what one formidable terrorist organization holds over the free world. Unless General Hawk's special unit can save the day. And, even then, the bad guys are tricky enough and far-thinking enough that Duke and company can't possibly foil each of their contingency plans. So, sequel, anyone?<br /><br />Some credit goes to the movie for trying to add detail to its characters' backstories. Same credit is then snatched away for the numbing and excessive flashbacks. There's too much dawdling, also, in some scenes early on in which the bad guys talk on and on about their big nefarious scheme. But two things, more than anything else, bugged the heck out of me: a) Being a Snake Eyes fan, I wasn't cool with Scarlett and Ripcord doing the flirty flirty, and b) Snake Eyes' mask has friggin' lips! What the --? Speaking of flirting, Duke and the Baroness having a past history is new to me, not that I minded it all that much, and their relationship turns out to be pretty key to the story. But I thought it's always been \\"Destro and the Baroness practicing the clarinet\\" (and if you don't get that reference, check out the Funny or Die website for the awesome Ballad of G.I. Joe video clip).<br /><br />The fighty fights to watch out for are the grudge matches between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow. There's also a nice bit between Scarlett and the Baroness, and I understand that both the very fine actresses (Rachel Nichols, Sienna Miller) actually suffered injuries while filming the scene. The rest of the action sequences are slick and big and must have cost a ton, but I just couldn't get into them. Just something so soulless and by-the-numbers to them, I think. And the bits with the exterior shots of the Pit (the G.I. Joe headquarters) somewhere in the Egyptian desert? Look very unconvincing.<br /><br />The actors playing the baddies carry the actors playing the heroes. There's something gleeful in how Christopher Eccleston, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Byung-hun Lee, Sienna Miller (yes, Sienna Miller), and Arnold Vosloo go about fleshing out their villainous parts. Gordon-Levitt gets a chance to chew the scenery a bit as the kookybag who would eventually become the Cobra Commander. In this movie, the Terrordrome is still but a gleam in his rat crazy eyes.<br /><br />G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA, at least, isn't as bad as TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN. But, y'know, I wouldn't have minded at all if they'd just taken the soldiers from the TRANSFORMERS flicks and revamped them into the Joes. Tyrese Gibson comes off as a more convincing and gritty elite commando than Marlon Wayans.<br /><br />I do like the off-handed way the iconic phrases were worked in (\\"real American heroes,\\" \\"Knowing is half the battle,\\" etc.). And despite Tatum Channing's weak interpretation, Duke remains my favorite Joe (And then Snake Eyes).<br /><br />Basically, if you were turned off by that trailer with the armor suits, then think of the film as one big extrapolation of that discontent. I'm glad G.I. Joe finally made it as a live action film, but damn...o me, not that I minded it all that much, and their relationship turns out to be pretty key to the story.

0385504225|5.0|I read this book over the weekend and while certainly not his best book, the book is a fast and fun read. Without spoiling the plot I will say that Mr. Brown has continued his interest in symbology--this time focusing on the Masons. He displays the ability to handle complex details with ease, and can make otherwise obscure information come alive. The way he weaves the different layers of plot while at the same time teaching you the information you need to understand the plot works well. If you liked his other books you will like the Lost Symbol. If you have never read a Dan Brown book, you can start with this one, but you would be better off starting with one of his earlier books--not that this one builds on his earler works, but because it would ease you into his writing style. All in all it was a great way to spend an otherwise dreary weekend.
B002QSTTOM|5.0|Man's Search for Meaning, Frankl    An engaging story from the first page, in which Frankl interweaves psychological implications with personal experience.  It is a book that is filled with wisdom and an irreplaceable perspective, namely that of one who has been through hell and lived to tell the tale.  Several thoughts jumped out at me as I read.  First, on p. 19 Frankl reveals an unsettling, yet profound, truth regarding the survivors and more importantly, those who did not survive.  \\"On the average, only those prisoners could keep alive who, after years of trekking from camp to camp, had lost all scruples in their fight for existence; they were prepared to use every means, honest and otherwise, even brutal force, theft, and betrayal of their friends, in order to save themselves.  We who have come back, by the aid of many lucky chances or miracles - whatever one may choose to call them - we know: the best of us did not return.\\"  What a sobering thought!  What a world that must have been, where humans were reduced to the very basest of existence.  Frankl later raises the question of whether or not we have any choice of how we will respond in our circumstances.  Are we simply a product of our circumstances, and any human would respond in the same, or similar, fashion?  Or do we have freedom of choice in facing our circumstances, no matter what they are?  Frankl answers that yes, we do have a choice.    The second part is an introduction to logotherapy.  He describes the technique of logotherapy as a meaning-based and future-oriented system.  He wants people to find meaning in their situation, especially as it relates to the living of their life with their desired future in mind.  He rejects the notion that our past controls us, and wishes people to realize their own responsibiltiy to make choices and to determine their own future.    The final section of the book is an essay that Frankl wrote called \\"The Case for a Tragic Optimism.  This short essay is rife with pearls of wisdom.  First, Frankl begins with what he calls the  'tragic triad' - those aspects of human existence that can be circumscribed by pain, guilt, or death.       Second, he does give a three-fold answer to the question of what gives life meaning.  These are: 1 - Creating a work or doing a deed; 2 - experiencing something or encountering someone; and 3 - Turning a tragedy into a triumph, ie: finding meaning in suffering.  Frankl ends with a discussion on not just the meaning in every life no matter what the circumstances, but also the value of every life no matter what the circumstances.  He contrasts our society's focus on youth and usefulness with a focus on the elderly and their dignity.  Youth have possibilities, the elderly have a store of actualities.  I love the way Frankl describes our past as a repository, or storehouse, of all that we have done and experienced.  Rather than saying the past is irretrievably lost, he looks at the past as being irrevocably stored and  treasured.  This is an interesting way to look at life, and puts a new perspective on our past.  Rather than try to bury it, or to relive it, we need to recognize that it is safely lived and is to be treasured and learned from.    Overall, this book is one of the most thought-provoking books I have ever read.  I am fascinated by the concepts of logotherapy, and am challenged to think in terms of my own future and what I hope for, as well as to see the meaning in my past and present as well.  Additionally, I believe this perspective will help me as I counsel others.  While Frankl does not touch much on faith and theology, this book definitely does impact the way I look at human nature, at suffering, and at what it means to live a life that has meaning.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|AVATAR<br /><br /> In my opinion Avatar proves that you can make a great movie without name stars.  A great script and a really good director can do it by themselves.<br /><br />On a lush planet called Pandora live the Na'vi, beings who appear primitive but actually are highly evolved. Because Pandora's environment is poisonous, human/Na'vi hybrids, called Avatars, are linked to human minds, allowing for free movement on Pandora. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paralyzed former Marine, becomes whole again through one such Avatar, and falls in love with a Na'vi woman (Zoe Saldana). As his bond with her grows, he is drawn into a battle for the survival of her world<br /><br /> In my opinion Avatar proves that you can make a great movie without name stars.  A great script and a really good director can do it by themselves.<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie enough.<br /><br />Gunner  December, 2009

B002OOG6YY|3.0|This video was so funny and yet so sad at the same time.  It is very common for bands to dub in crowd noise to make the show sound better than it really was.  Kiss was best known for this on Kiss Alive and Kiss Alive II.  But it doesn't really work on a DVD because you can see the crowd.      How does a crowd that is 90% men sound like a bunch of girls in between songs?  LOL.  You can see the crowd just standing around waiting for the next song, but when you hear it, you would swear the Beatles just hit the stage.   TOO FUNNY.    Look Manson, if you are going to steal some crowd noise to dub in, get it from a Maiden show or Slayer show where it's mostly men.  Don't be dubbing in Cheap Trick Live at Budakon.    So said and yet so funny.
B002OHB3CG|4.0|I wasn't sure how I felt when Within Temptation announced the release of An Acoustic Night at the Theatre -yet another live album with alternative versions of previous songs. After hearing these songs on albums and live on Black Symphony, I wasn't sure if I wanted to hear more of the same. I decided to try it out because I'm a hardcore WT fan -and was relatively happy with what I found.    Even though An Acoustic Night at the Theatre features songs we've all heard before, the acoustic spin was surprisingly enjoyable and gave songs a warmer, more intimate feel. I actually felt like I had some time to breath here, as opposed to Black Symphony, which was non-stop high-octane action from start to finish. An Acoustic Night at the Theatre also allowed for Sharon to show off just how beautiful her raw voice is (before studio production) and re-focus the energy of WT on her pure, angelic vocals.    I was, though, a little surprised (and slightly disappointed) by the track list here. Many of the songs chosen translated far too easily to acoustic since they were already slower paced, such as \\"Memories,\\" \\"Forgiven,\\" \\"Frozen,\\" \\"The Cross\\" and \\"All I Need.\\" I admit that I have to forgive the selection of \\"Somewhere\\" because I loved this version even more than the Black Symphony one -despite the fact that Anneke's vocals were recorded. Something about it just felt warmer to me -stronger and more sincere.    Other songs took a greater risk. For example, \\"What Have You Done\\" was very interesting to hear acoustically; while \\"Caged\\" was a bold and strangely engaging choice (even though it sounds so completely different) and \\"Stand My Ground\\" just seemed to lose its punch (part of what I originally liked about this song was the power behind it).    The only truly new item here is \\"Utopia,\\" which was also released as a single. \\"Utopia\\" features a duet between Sharon and guest vocalist Chris Brown. While Sharon sounds as gorgeous as always, I wasn't too excited about the song -it just didn't have a unique sound to it and I found it to be kind of flat.    Generally, this CD is best for hardcore WT fans. While the songs sound a little warmer and more intimate (and are kind of a nice break after Black Symphony), they wouldn't appeal much to casual listeners or those who are new to the band or genre (I suggest going right to The Heart of Everything for these folks). But I have to admit -Sharon sounds like an opera angel here and her voice is mesmerizing.
B001CTDH76|5.0|A breath of fresh air into the TV world , it doesn't have the brutality of Criminal Minds , nor does it have the lack lustre of CSI , it is an amazing human view of the true criminal mind.
B001O8C5EQ|5.0|Let yourself wrapped arround this expectacular dark expirience,  where hypnotic power rock riffs and a gothic - lounge ambience are perfectly and symphonicaly blent together.  This,  by all means, is one of my favorite PT album.      Can't add anything else to my review:   Buy it !    Hope this review will help you.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|I don't really care for New Age music.   It's basically ambient/electronica's yuppie neo-conservative older sister.   But it's better listening than alot of today's pop music.    The only songs I ever heard from  Enya was Orinnoco Flow and one other from way back in the day.  Catchy but gimmicky as far as I was concerned.    Last night I had sex with friend (ok,  it wasn't exactly \\"lovemaking\\") and she asked me what I wanted to listen to.    She loves New Age music and has an extensive collection of Yanni,  Andreas Vollenweider, George Winston and Enigma among others.     I definitely didn't want  to hear any Enigma.   That's a mood killer almost as bad as Yanni.   So she surprised me and put this on.   I didn't know who it was at first but I did guess that it was Enya.   The music was beautiful.  Very haunting especially the last track.   Stuck in my head even after I left this morning.   I still don't care for New Age but maybe I'll get re-educated one cd at a time.   Or maybe it's just the sex talking......
1400151376|4.0|I recently picked up all 3 books in the trilogy and listened to them back to back.  I found the first one enjoyable, but a little jumbled.  Some of the detective work done by Kovac made no sense and several obvious routes of investigation were left unexplored.  Often I felt like the Kovac just stumbled onto answers.      As set up to the universe and character this book is fantastic.  I enjoyed the depth to which the author explored all the various impacts re-sleaving would have upon a civilization.  The book was good enough to make me want to listen to both sequels, which I think are more enjoyable books.    I recommend getting all 3 books.  It's almost necessary to fully understand Kovac's character.    Hope to see a fourth book someday.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Lovable for many reasons.  The animation is stunning -- even the most stoic among us should appreciate the 'reality' that has been rendered from mathematical models, and the attention that was given to the most minute details.  Beyond that, the story is charming; I never though I would have 'bought into' a friendship between two robots, but these two are irresistible (and come to think it, why couldn't future machines be programmed with 'emotions' and a sense of self-survival?).  There are plenty of laughs throughout (it may take several viewings to catch them all) and enough light tension to keep one's attention.  It's been commented before that the first half hour or so are a remarkable study in both existentialism and environmentalism, a point with which I agree.  I would have preferred that the creators had left out the holographic billboards that explained the plot, as we eventually would have figured that out (there -- I wanted to get that off my chest!).  WALL-E leaps to new standards of excellence in both animation and storytelling.
B002QGSOU4|5.0|This is a great gift set with room for MTV unplugged new york and sold out live dvd's with a very nice poster.  The live at Reading is an amazing live performance in every sense, the sound quality is outstanding, the bands tight, Cobain is in top form and the set list is awesome.  I wish I could have seen this show back in the day, at least now I can watch and listen to it.  This is worth every penny.
B001KVZ6FW|2.0|I had big hopes for this movie following as it did on the heels of WALL-E.   In spite of a couple of chuckles, UP lacked the charm, the plot, the suspense, the credibility, the music and, surprisingly, even the animation quality of its predecessor.   Maybe WALL-E just set the bar far too high.  One star for being 'colorful' and another for at least being better than some of the drek that's out there right now.

B002NWRMVS|5.0|This cd does not rate 5 stars...it is definitely a 10!!! Norah has recorded one of the best cds of the year. Her lyrics are stunning and as always her vocals prove that she is one of a kind. I can only hope that record buyers and listeners catch up with the sophistication, power, and yet subtle genius that goes by the name of Norah Jones.
B002W6Z0UK|1.0|Hey, its a new low in low-brow pop music. The corporations have created a new singing Frankenstien Monster; although this one has a larger vocabulary. \\"Fire Bad\\" set to a disco beat would sound better than the title track of this CD; I doubt GagGag fans would notice the difference. Some people say that this musical mugging was censored - I say it was not censored enough.       Even with autotune, GagGag's voice sounds like a cat clawing its way up a tin roof while calling to its mate. Certain notes that she bellows out can actually be physically painful. Can the corporations please push a real singer for a change? The voice is bad enough, but the music is so poor as to be laughable. The sound is so sloppy, lazy and poorly constructed - car crashes sound better. THUMP-THUMP-THUMP-THUMP-THUMP-THUMP-OOOOOOOAH-THUMP-THUMP-THUMP....      Who is the target demographic for GagGag? Club monkeys? Young idiots? Probably. This dreck is not for people who like to listen to good music. Don't buy this  - make the corporates work for their money. Make them give you quality, not quantity..

B002T9H2LA|4.0|Just got my copy of inglorious basterds today after work..  first off ive seen this film when it came out..and its one of tarintino's best since pulp fiction and the kill bill films.    sure, it had great acting, and a great cast  which reminds me of films like the guns of navarone and the dirty dozen (great ww2 films also)    But for me and i know im not alone on this one..  the nazi   colonel hans \\"the jew Hunter\\" landa   was the real star of this film. he was played cool and calculating sort of a nazi hannibal lecter  and at oscar time  the actor that played him  actor should have a nomination.    the movie is your basic revenge plot  brad pitt(with an over the top southern accent)  leads an all jewish  \\"nazi Killing\\" goon squad into nazi occupied europe  with the task to take out the top leaders of the third reich. sounds cool huh?  well it is.  im a ww2 fan  and at first i wasnt sure about this film  but i was surprised..its an instant classic.     there s lots of action, and suspense and lets not forget that  classic tarintino violence!  ww2 style!    Bottom line if you want to see a great ww2 action film  this film wont dissapoint.
B002PMV9FG|2.0|Unfortunately this episode will go down as the dullest, most boring of the lot.  A plodding, scatterbrained story line that leaves you wondering - \\"what just happened\\" and \\"what does this mean\\"?  The action sequences present in all previous episodes are virtualy non-existent in this one, and weak performances by the three primary characters make this film a real stinker!
B002MW50KO|2.0|Bob Dylan make a Christmas album?  Of Christmas classics?  Almost every Dylan fan and plenty of the just-plain-curious would buy that.  Good marketing, mediocre album.  I fell for it.  I've long been a Dylan fan, but with most of Christmas in the Heart, it felt like he was just phoning it in.  His voice has grown more gravelly with time, but on most songs, it lacked any unique character.  The track \\"Must be Santa\\" is a lot of fun, and so is \\"Christmas Island,\\" but credit for much of that goes to the arrangements and the back-up singers.  On most of the tracks, Dylan sounds like your liquored-up  grandfather with a cold.
B002P5XXR0|4.0|James Cameron makes a habit of being groundbreaking. Whether he is creating a planet full of ferocious xenomorphs in Aliens, experimenting with liquid metal robots in Terminator II, or making a realistic recreation of a sinking boat in Titanic, the Canadian director has always been at the forefront of cutting edge cinematic technology, pushing the envelope of what is creatively and technologically possible on the screen. His latest film, Avatar, continues that trend; with an estimated budget of $320 million, it's the most expensive film ever made, and looks set to become one of the biggest grossing films of all time too.    The film's plot is deceptively simple. Set in a future where the Earth's natural resources have been depleted to the point where the planet is almost uninhabitable, human scientists find a distant planet called Pandora, which is rich in a rare mineral that can replenish the Earth's atmosphere and save humanity. The problem: Pandora is inhabited by a race of 10-foot tall, blue-skinned humanoid creatures called the Na'vi, who don't take kindly to an alien species coming and strip-mining their lush, beautiful planet. Needing a way to infiltrate Na'vi society, Earth's military leaders develop a technology that allows humans to assume control of genetically-bred Na'vi hybrid bodies - the `avatars' of the title. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a former marine paralyzed from the waist down after being injured in combat, is recruited to the secret program, having been lured by the prospect of being able to walk again via his avatar. Once on Pandora, and with orders to learn as much about the Na'vi in advance of a full-scale invasion, Jake finds himself being assimilated into their culture. However, rather than encountering a savage, primitive race, Jake falls in love with the Na'vi, their simple lives, their closeness to nature, and with Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a Na'vi warrior princess. Before long, Jake finds himself torn between his duty to the military and his mission, and his new found respect for the peace-loving aliens.    Despite having been dubbed `Dances With Smurfs' by some of the more unkind online bloggers, Avatar is nevertheless a thought-provoking mix of environmental awareness and full-blooded cinematic action that shares conceptual ideas with both Dances With Wolves and Starship Troopers (although it is less blatantly satirical than Robert Heinlein's classic novel), drawing thematic parallels with the European colonization of the Americas and the subsequent obliteration of native American culture, and asking audiences to examine their prejudices.    For Avatar's music, Cameron once again turned to James Horner; the last time the pair worked together was on Titanic, for which Horner won his first (and, to date, only) Best Score Oscar. One of the stipulations Cameron gave to Horner was that he must not work on any other films during the period that Avatar was being made; as such, this is Horner's first score since The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, which was completed in the spring of 2008. With an uncommonly long 18-month period in which to write his music, Horner worked closely with sound designer Christopher Boyes to develop an alien language for the Na'vi, which Horner would utilize for the choral parts of his score. He also spent a great deal of time creating a unique musical `sound palette' to represent the Na'vi culture, taking inspiration from everything from ancient Finnish woodwinds to Indonesian gamelan music, as well as inventing brand new percussion instruments from scratch, in an attempt to capture the visual `bioluminescence' of Pandora through music.    The first thing that Horner's detractors will jump on is the fact that, for the 100th time, Horner has referenced some of his own earlier works. The main theme sounds like the main theme from The Four Feathers. Some of the percussive and vocal parts sound like the African music from Mighty Joe Young. Some of the action writing is similar to the action writing in Troy. Some of the vocal work will also remind you of Apocalypto. The synth programming is similar to the synth programming in Titanic, and one romantic theme is similar to the Rose theme from that score. Elsewhere he references scores as obscure as Where the River Runs Black and Thunderheart, especially in some of the ethnic woodwind phrasing and electronic rhythmic elements. Virtually the first thing you hear on the album, within the first 60 seconds of the first cue, is the four-note `danger motif' that has littered dozens and dozens of scores throughout his career. If, after 25 years, you still haven't reconciled yourself to this facet of Horner's musical personality and it still bothers you, don't buy the CD - unless you enjoy purchasing music that you know will outrage you, and you get your rocks off complaining about it on an internet message board. It's time to move on from this argument and just accept that this is how Horner works, and embrace instead his astounding dramatic sense, his boundless enthusiasm for the art, and his masterful command of an orchestra.    Much of the first half of the score is concerned with setting the scene, and giving the Na'vi and their culture its musical identity. Tribal percussion, ethnic woodwinds, breathy wordless vocals and Native American-style chanting in the Na'vi language by Drea Pressley and Mark Edward Smith anchor the opening cue, \\"You Don't Dream In Cryo...\\". There's not a great deal of prominent thematic writing in the first few cues, which is unusual for a Horner score; instead, it concerns itself with abstract textures and voluminous percussion writing, and with layers of cool synths underpinning the orchestra, establishing a mood which is both alien and familiar. After a few moments of unusually comical pizzicato build-up, \\"Jake Enters His Avatar World\\" adopts an untouched, almost primeval sound, with breathy whispered vocal performances, Amazonian-style woodwind flutters, and more than ahint of danger through the use of Horner's familiar `crashing pianos' and some chaotic percussion writing. By the end of the cue, however, the music has embraced a sense of wondrous freedom, as though celebrating Jake's boundless enthusiasm at being set free in this remarkable new landscape.    \\"Pure Spirits of the Forest\\" and \\"The Bioluminescence of the Night\\" have a shimmering, iridescent quality, and make excellent use of long-lined string writing underpinned by beds of soothing synths, often incorporating tribal rhythms, chanting vocals and eerie woodwind calls to add to the sense of alien mystique. There is a sense of calmness, and of peace about this music; it's the kind of music that conjures up images of starlit skies seen through shadowy treetops at night, or of a spiritual communion with nature. Even here, though, there is still danger lurking in the darkness, as the strident brass performances and guttural growls towards the end of \\"Pure Spirits of the Forest\\" attest.    The first performance of the score's recurring main theme appears towards the middle of \\"Becoming One of the People; Becoming One With Neytiri\\"; this is the theme that is clearly modeled after the theme from The Four Feathers, and forms the cornerstone of the score's main emotional content, dealing with the developing romance between Jake and Neytiri. The lilt in the melody, and the passion in the writing, is palpable, and hugely rewarding. Towards the end of \\"Becoming One With Neytiri\\" there is a sublime romantic sequence for strings, piano and Tony Hinnigan's effortlessly expressive woodwinds that brings back wonderful memories of the William/Murron romance from Braveheart and the Jack/Rose romance from Titanic.    The rest of this cue, and later cues such as \\"Climbing Up Iknimaya - The Path to Heaven\\" and \\"Jake's First Flight\\", are expansive celebrations of the Na'vi culture, with broad and joyous themes accentuated by all kinds of percussion and warm, almost child-like vocals. Despitea few superficial similarities to Brian Tyler's Children of Dune, this music succeeds in capturing the essence of the Na'vi, and their respectful symbiotic relationship with their world. It is worth noting that, in \\"Jake's First Flight\\", Horner cleverly re-orchestrates a variation on Col. Shaw's theme from his 1989 classic Glory into a vibrant, tribal celebration that is simply glorious.    Things begin to turn ugly in \\"Scorched Earth\\", heralding the arrival of the humans on Pandora. From here on in, Horner's music returns to a more familiar orchestral palette, but adopts a harsher, more militaristic tone, a significantly larger brass section, and increased levels of dissonance. Some of the brass trills in \\"Scorched Earth\\" rekindle memories of the brutal Nockmaar music from Willow; the metallic percussion hits and thunderous ostinati in \\"Quaritch\\" are Horner trademarks, while the choral writing in the lavish and intense \\"The Destruction of Hometree\\" is the grandest Horner has written since Enemy at the Gates. Throughout all of these cues Horner maintains his use of the Na'vi vocals, overlaying the foreign chants over the music, often in synchronicity with the rhythms, often as a kind of lamenting counterpoint to the orchestral carnage, but always to great effect. Equally lamenting is the distressing vocal performance in \\"Shutting Down Grace's Lab\\" that recalls the great Rahat Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's mournful howls in The Four Feathers, which gives the piece a unmistakable sense of overwhelming tragedy.    The conclusion of the score is a 15-minute epic comprising \\"Gathering All the Na'vi Clans for Battle\\" and \\"War\\". It builds from a contemplative violin solo and a noble performance of the main theme, a moment of calm before an impending storm. Relentlessly building rhythms, more ethnic vocals, and huge performances of the main that seem to imply a sense of purpose and destiny eventually give way to thunderous brassy battle calls, thrusting percussion writing and heroic Na'vi war cries. As the final cue develops, it picks up a pulsating electronic undercurrent, as if pitting the unyielding, mechanized forces of humanity against the more earthy sounds of the Na'vi. As the piece reaches its conclusion, Horner begins to interpolate rousing fragments of the main theme into the action material, before ending with a reflective solo violin refrain which rounds out the score on a philosophical note.    Having said all that, and despite understanding the reason why Horner wrote the score the way he did, the thing missing from Avatar - and the thing that stops it from getting truly top marks - is long-lasting memorability. While there are literally dozens and dozens of excellent individual moments dotted throughout the score, the sum of these parts never quite add up to the classic Avatar clearly wants to be. The main theme, while undeniably attractive, is not memorable enough to go down as a Horner standard. The ethnic vocals, while certainly effective, aren't as innovative or groundbreaking as Horner's 18-month research period would have us believe. The action material is certainly impressive, and will likely be remembered as the score's strongest part, but you need more than rousing action alone to create a balanced, strong album.    And speaking of creating a balanced, strong album, listeners will most likely want to skip the quite awful song, \\"I See You\\", performed by British R&B artist and music reality show winner Leona Lewis. It's an over-processed, over-produced monstrosity with banal lyrics and an unfathomable internal tempo which, despite being based on Horner's main theme, completely loses its way as a romantic ballad. It's clearly intended to recapture the same buzz as Celine Dion/My Heart Will Go On, but is a significantly inferior song.    Avatar is a strong score. Horner's dramatic sensibility can never be faulted, and his mastery over the instrumental palette at his disposal is second to none. Although its general air of over-familiarity gives his critics plenty of ammunition to trot out the tired old `self plagiarism' chestnut again, this should not dissuade admirers of Horner's work from seeking this out, because there is still a lot to admire here, and the positives vastly outweigh the negatives. However, perhaps a little inevitably, the score does not live up to the hype that preceded its release. It's not the best score of 2009 - it's not even in the top five - and will not go down in history as one of Horner's quintessential works, however much success the film itself attains.

0340733500|5.0|First of all, I do not like to read.  I picked this book up the first time in Walmart last year on a whim.  It sat on a counter in my home for several months and then when my life was at a really low point, I picked it up one day and started reading.  I was left with one impression as I turned each new page and that was simply, \\"wow\\".   The words I was reading had so much raw wisdom that it felt like the words of God as I read them.  I was mesmerized and the concepts that I found inside this book really changed the way I viewed the world.  I saw things through new eyes as if it was all new to me again.       My copy was always in my possession and it got water damaged in the car one day, so I found a new copy here at Amazon and for less than I paid for the original at Walmart.     In short, this book is great!
B000056HE9|2.0|I'd heard about this movie all my life, so on a whim I purchased it from Amazon and settled down with my eggnog for a holiday treat.  Was I disappointed!  I'd expected something on the caliber of It's a Wonderful Life.  Instead, I thought this movie was shallow and contrived.  It's an insipid story line about how a nice angel improves everyone's attitude by doing a few parlor tricks like straightening files and providing a never-ending bottle of whiskey.  Loretta Young's character wallowed in subservient self-pity.  David Niven's cold portrayal of her bishop husband didn't warm up much, even after the angel's visit.  I didn't really care for any of the characters, and found myself yawning.  The film was nominated for Best Picture after its 1940s release, so I'm sure there's a host of Americans who disagree with me, but I wish I hadn't wasted my money.

Anyone else?

And Gwyneth Paltrow -- well, what else can I say?       The costuming is excellent, the props top-notch and the story line beautifully written.        I showed the last 20 minutes or so to my Freshmen English classes and they too enjoyed it. And anytime you can get ninth graders to appreciate the Bard, I'd say you have accomplished the mission. I rate this film 5 stars!
0451209338|2.0|Silva at times, made it hard to take this book seriously.   I don't understand how Silva (or his editors) could think a popular supermodel who has dominated the fashion industry for 10 to 15 yrs, could be a viable candidate to be an UNDERCOVER spy.   Also, the staging of the final confrontation was clumsy and predictable.  This is just not a good book. Bordeline sloppy.

B002R0F3Q2|1.0|Alicia Keys is my favorite singer, but she's losing me now. What ever happened to the soulful vibe in her music? The first two albums Ms. Keys put out where amazing! The piano, the melodies, the mellow sort of mood you got from some of the songs, I loved it all. But something in her changed after the second effort.     This new album is much like her third album, but worse. The songs on this are either dumbed down pop music like that HORRIBLE Beyonce track (Why is that on here??) or just boring, and uninspired. I can't help but feel like this was rushed because I know she can do a lot better then this.     This isn't a really bad album, it just doesn't have a lot of depth to it. When you pop this into your CD player don't expect to be blown away, it's just an okay effort, it's 'safe'. I'll give this a 6.5/10, but it gets a one star just in case Ms. Keys reads these reviews. I want her to try harder on the next one.
0784011176|5.0|I love this movie.  Very happy I finally found it.  Holly Hunter is excellent.     For a woman of few words, she send a very powerful message.  The scernery is beautiful.  Makes me want to go to New Zealand.
1601251556|2.0|I'm not going to troll, im not going to fan-boy this. I saw it here, and though it was a great deal. I wont lie, i thought it would be a vinyl type mat, i was sadly mistaken however. This showed up at my door looking like a laminated piece of paper. I could have made it myself for cheaper. But, im not going to only bash it, it does serve its purpose, for the most part. Its a good beginners mat for role playing games (i.e. Dnd etc.) If you are an experienced player, or want a mat that will last you for years, i suggest you go with a game mat by Chessex, they're well priced for a heavy duty mat that will last a good amount of time. So that's it, i can say im amazed with this product, but im severly disappointed with what i got in the mail. Hope this is useful to even one person.
B002MW50KO|5.0|When I played the samples I laughed, but appreciated the donation being made for the purchase.  Then I played the samples a few more times and bought the CD.  When you first hear it, you almost wish he had created the CD 15 years ago, when his voice was a little stronger.  Then, you realize its Bob Dylan!  He did it his way and actually, you like it.  Dylan has never been considered the greatest singer and you realize its his style, so its wonderful.  If you are a Dylan fan, you will enjoy and appreciate the CD.  It is Christmas afterall and Bob Dylan is a historical part of American music and culture.
B002XSP16A|1.0|I admit that I was somewhat taken aback by Ms. Boyle's performance of \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" on one of Simon Cowell's many television shows, but that interest can't be sustained by listening to this hodge-podge of cover versions of other genuinely-talented singer's performances.<br />Another gimicky piece of sludge pawned off on the non-discriminate \\"music\\" fans of the world.  I only wish that 10% of the persons who waste their dough on this singer would instead purchase a recording by any number of excellent female vocalists, such as Patricia Barber or Claire Martin -- even Diana Krall.<br />I can think of many things I would rather do than listen to the amateurish phrasing and questionable musicianship of Britain's worse export since Robin Leach.<br />Think more of yourself and be brave enough to seek out real talent.  Leave the sideshow antics of Mr. Cowell and his ilk alone.  Please!!

B002T9H2LA|4.0|Some kind of great film, which I got from Netflix. I would purchase my own copy but for one major problem: much of the movie is subtitled (Germans speak German, the French French), and the DVD uses the subtitles as they appeared in the theatrical version rather than dropping and enlarging them as is usually done on foreign language films released on DVD. The subtitles on \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" are too often difficult (sometimes impossible) to read even on a decent-sized TV screen, and some of the jokes and plot points are lost. I regret not seeing this movie in the theater,and I will hold off on any further viewing or purchase until such time as an improved disc with legible subtitles is issued. This DVD release was a major disservice to a major film.

B001CDLATE|5.0|I need a disc to test my home theater.  I purchased this Blu-ray disc because of its reputation of being the first 8K digital transfer from 65mm film.  The picture quality is stunning.  The music sounds great too, but there is not much audio special effects to test my sound system.  Chronos was made by the same director.  I've purchased that too, but Chronos is inferior compared to this.    The contents are amazing too.  Great imagery from around the world.  Some parts may scare young children.  e.g. the stacks of human skulls in Cambodia and the open air cremation and a close up shot of a partially cremated human remain may bring nightmare to young kids.
B002FRNCG0|4.0|Brand New Eyes by Paramore is a good album but not as memorable as Riot! or even All We Know is Falling. What I do like about this album is how powerful Hayley Williams's vocals have matured in only 4 short years. Hayley's vocal delivery is breathtaking especially on the closing track, All I Wanted - you can feel her anguish when she hits that unreal high note towards end of the song. I like Brand New Eyes but I am not in love with it like Riot! Some of the tracks have little melody like Feeling Sorry or Where the Lines Overlap. The songs that are standouts include: Ignorance, Playing God, Turn It Off, The Only Exception, All I Wanted, and Misguided Ghosts. I feel the band is trying too hard to sound \\"adult\\" - they are so good at writing catchy pop/punk songs. Good effort from a little band from Franklin, Tennessee who almost called it quits last year.
0345479092|3.0|This book is ok. There are somethings that I can follow and some I can't. I think it is a bit odd this lady wants you to talk to the baby about EVERYTHING.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Since I am crazy about Susan Boyle, I feel this is a great cd.  The music she performs has varied styles and genres.  Her voice is wonderful.  If you liked her on \\"Britain's Got Talent,\\" you will love this cd.
0307474275|5.0|Obviously, the objective of the book is, from my viewpoint, to satisfy people's general disposition to love mysteries and also to sell it for the author's and his family's bread next day. I do not think that the author's intention is to undermine some of Christians' beliefs. However, because I am a self-claimed non-materialist, I know, and perhaps also you know, that there is a book published in 1972 by the late Jane Roberts: \\"Seth Speaks\\", in which the non-physical entity Seth spoke about the Christ story. This very story, you agree with me if you read it, may undermine Christians' beliefs more than this Dan Brown's book might have done. However, as Henri Bergson stated in his \\"The Two Sources of Morality and Religion,\\" the moral written in New Testament should be definitely great!
B001PPLJIQ|3.0|The Reader is about several issues: war crimes, revisiting the past, the consequences of past decisions, healing old wounds, protecting secrets at all costs.     For the first thirty minutes, the film depicts the sexual encounters between Hanna and Michael ad nauseum. Michael, a teenager boy who is sick, is taken in by the older Hanna and he begins to read to her as a part of their liaisons. Being young and naïve, Michael is later crushed by Hanna's cold, aloof manner and ultimately her rejection of him.     Fast forward years later, and as a law student, Michael is shocked to see Hanna on trial for the war crime of murder. Women on duty are accused of letting 300 Jewish women perish in a fire. As the trial progresses, there is a critical moment when Hanna, a former SS soldier, has an opportunity to save face, but rather than do this, she admits writing a report to cover up a secret she's been hiding all along--her illiteracy. The past comes to light in Michael's point of view--she had wanted him to read to her during every sexual encounter. He has a dilemma to deal with, being that he has crucial information about the defendant. He seeks advice from his law teacher by indirectly saying he has information about the woman on trial, but ultimately he has to choose what to do on his own. Eventually he begins recording books to send to her after she is sentenced to life. Feeling distant in life, he makes arrangements to try to reconcile his own life and family, and also the past.     As some have indicated, character motives in this film are a bit perplexing. Michael is quite distant to his own family, but this is never truly explained. One may assume that the past experience as a young man with Hanna scarred Michael, but would it have this deep of an impact on his family life years later? Also, it seemed strange that Michael would act cold to Hanna after going to so much trouble to ease her prison life. Admittedly, I haven't read the novel that this film is based on.Perhaps those are addressed in the book. Many aspects just don't seem to add up, and we are left feeling aloof ourselves.     Also, the film is a bit uneven . There is too much time spent in the first thirty minutes with Hanna and Michael sexual encounters and not enough time on Michael's revelations later on in life. At times, the film seems to move too slowly, but then doesn't spend enough time on critical moments, such as the film's resolution. The slow scenes seem to reduce the power and intensity of critical moments, and this makes for a less effective film.     Over all, this is a passable film, but nothing exceptional.
B0029LHW68|5.0|A fan since their 1st album, any diehard fan with fall in love with this album.  For any new fan, you will look forward to AT LEAST 5 unreal songs.  To me this album, is more positive than \\"A Beautiful Lie\\".  Its about breaking through and getting past adversity.  At least thats my two cents. This is not an emo album.  I'm 29, but teenagers and College kids will still relate to it.  This is alternative rock album.  A better description would be a alternative HARD rock album.    This is an extremely hard hitting album.  Pretty much all of the songs are drum heavy, with Jared's vocal range sweeping from a quiet low, to a loud screaming high.  Shannon Leto is really unbelievable. I can't believe just how good he really is compared the the previous albums.    Brothers Shannon and Jared really prove they are not a gimmick, or a 1 time wonder.  These guys are seriously hardcore talented.    If you don't buy this album, you will regret it.
160024842X|1.0|The book so far seems great, but the problem is, the narrator.  The author should have never read her own book.  She sounds like a 50 year old librarian reading to an audience rather than a performer reading a book professionally.      I went ahead and bought the 2002 audiobook edition read by Alyssa Bresnahan, and its infinitely better!  Don't waste the money like I did, and get this version.  [[ASIN:1402532903 The Lovely Bones]]
0765356139|5.0|Being a fan of Robert Jordan, I became interested in Brandon Sanderson.  He weaves a wonderfully complex story with much better character development that most authors in this genre.  I can see why he was chosen to complete Jordan's wheel of time series.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|Saw this in the theater and even my wife loved it. The casting while fresh is very complimentary to the original cast. I watched it twice the day I got it and then we had a viewing party to look for R2D2 in the film (He's in there just don't blink or you'll miss him). I like having the option of downloading a digital copy for my portable video player and the extras are nice as well.
0439023491|5.0|Suzanne Collins has continued to hold me captive with her writing in the sequel to the Hunger Games.  As a teacher, I often read young adult books to find material that is high interest for engaging discussions, but this has become my own person favorite! I love that these books can be enjoyed on a variety of levels: superficially, for the adventure/love triangle themes and on a much deeper level that explores the ramifications of violence, society, and the role that children play between the two.  After reading both books, I found myself daydreaming about the characters and plot, and rehashing events and details in my mind. I absolutely cannot wait for the third book to see what Suzanne Collins creates!
1416972242|5.0|It literally was such a wonderful and enticing read that I just couldn't put the book down. There were so many twists and turns that you couldn't expect all of them to even be possible. I was looking for a great read at the time and I read the first book in one day I needed to go grab the second one as soon as possible. And that's what I did.   It truly is something that will keep you guessing right until the very end and STILL leave you begging for the third book in the series. Definitely something to enjoy if you love romance, fantasy, adventure, mystery....I could go on. Which does include frustration of Jace and Clary!

B002XHN776|5.0|Not since I purchased U2's Joshua Tree in 1987 have I bought an album and loved every song on it. Frontman Jared Leto's voice sounds better than ever and his lyrics are haunting and give you just a little insight into what this band went through to make this album. My personal favorite - Alibi, but don't miss This is War and Vox Populi.
B002MW50KO|5.0|I've been a fan of Dylan's since I was thirteen years old -- it has been nearly 45 years since I first heard him sing.  When I read that he was making a Christmas album, I thought the world as I knew it was coming to an end.     Of course I knew I would buy it -- out of curiosity if nothing else.   Perhaps I would listen to it once (just to hear for myself if this was really true), and then keep it as a \\"collector's item.\\"    Well, my husband gave me the cd last Friday night, and I first played it as I was cleaning up the horse  barn Saturday morning.  Imagine my surprise when I realized I LOVED it!  I laughed, I cried, I danced a little as I was shoveling and sweeping, and I sang along.  It is a truly strange Christmas album, though -- much more musically informed than the \\"Xmas Muzak\\" we're used to hearing.    The band is first rate (I think this is the band Dylan has had with him on the never ending concert tour).  The sound on many of the songs is very 40's & 50's -- back up vocals, etc., but with more depth and a bit of an edge.    It is not cliche', and it is not \\"superficial.\\"  There is some tongue-in-cheek stuff, in \\"Here Comes Santa Claus.\\"  \\"Must be Santa Claus\\" sounded like frantic Klezmer music.  The little bit of harmonica in \\"Winter Wonderland\\" is an unusual touch.  \\"Little Drummer Boy\\" seems totally sincere and actually brought a few tears... even though I am emphatically NOT a fan of that song.  Rum pom pom pom, indeed.    The fact that ALL of Dylan's royalties, current and future are going to a charity that feeds the hungry  is enough to make me like the album (if not actually listen to it).  But, I've found myself listening to it at least once a day, sometimes twice or three times, since I got it.   It lifts my spirits.  My sense is that Dylan had great fun doing this \\"work\\" -- and his enjoyment is contagious.   I've bought several more copies to give as gifts.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|This may be a little biased as i have not tried any other types of electronic sweepers, but i can tell you, with three kids i am constantly sweeping; after every meal, after every snack and after every craft activity.  This sweeper makes 'day to day' living easy!  The 360 degree swivel action really works well as i don't have to move chairs out from under the kitchen table anymore.  Gets into corners well too!  Love it love it love it!!!  And for my next purchase - i'd love to try the G2 model!

B001RTP3Z0|5.0|While there may not be a conveyance of dramatic videography, the concert was covered eloquently. I watched this before seeing LC live on this tour and after. I am so glad I bought the DVD because it takes me back to that night each and every time, which makes it most memorable and oustanding in my opinion. This man is a masterpiece himself. At 75, to even be doing what he is doing, (\\"If it be your will\\", as he says) is nothing short of magnificent. I have not enough praise for Leonard Cohen and every member of the band. I have heard other singer/songwriters as they reach their golden years become rough voiced and out of tune. LC has done no such thing. I think he has actually gotten better with age and far prefer his depth of voice now to his earlier recordings.<br /><br />The concert covers the majority of his greatest songs. Of course he could not cover them all in one concert. At the show I saw he actually did Chelsea Hotel in addition to the playlist shown. This concert runs 2.5 hours plus so you will definitly get your money's worth. Warm, humble, adoring of his back up singers the 'sublime' Webb Sisters, collaborator Sharon Robinson and other band members, Leonard pays tribute to them throughout the evening. They are each and every one a vital ingredient in the stupendous talent emanating from and creating the masterpiece which is this musical presentation.<br /><br />This is a must have for any LC fan. LC does not fit into any genre, he creates his own and in my opinion, is the greatest lyricist and wordsmith of our time. Even my grandkids ( aged 5 & 2) are going around the house singing \\"Hallelujah!\\". It's good to know that they are being exposed to real music and something beyond the top 40 pop charts. This is real, from the gut and from the soul, unsurpassed depth of talent..... moving beyond words.

076790592X|5.0|This book is a life changing book. Its one of those books that make you stop and think about your own life; how you can help or change the world in someway and start with your own life. Just the way everything is stated in this book, its amazing. Tuesdays with Morrie highlights the most important things in our lives. It states how people think and act and how we need to not worry about how other people do it and do it our own way. This book tells how we need to stay focused in what is happening to ourselves and around us, to open our eyes to what we need and what we only want. This book is prety much amazing and short, one of the best books i've read.
0316069906|5.0|. . . in terms of becoming a classic commentary on animals, factory farming, and the complex systems that have brought us to this point in our culture.    This is a fantastic book. It's eminently readable, completely heartbreaking, and painstakingly researched. I'm already a committed vegan, so this book is not going to change how I feel about meat, but still, a lot of the information in it is new and will help me to get this compelling message across.    Anyone who has given this a one or two star review either does not like the message or the messenger, but what's in the book is true, it's important, and I believe one of the moral imperatives of our time. We are lucky to have such a passionate and articulate spokesman.

B000ZELISO|1.0|I have waited to see the movie and so had such high hopes, wonderful as previous movie adaptations of JK Rowlings books have been, and this purchase was a major disappointment!    The movie makers added things NOT found in the book, which alter the events for the future movies, and they left out so many details and points which also changed the movie from the book.    Some changes are expected, the first two movies in this series were masterfully transfered from print to screen.  The others adequately.  THIS was terrible!    Not only am I unhappy with the changes they made between book and movie, the production values are awful.  I've played blu-ray on my system and this blu-ray simply lacked in every way.  Not satisfying, not good, not pleasing in any way.    I simply feel that this movie wasted my time and money.  I expected a reasonable film, expected things to be darker and stranger, but I did expect a blu-ray to have a better picture than an old VHS tape!!    BAD JOB.

B001KVZ6FW|3.0|Up is a considerably overated movie, it certainly does not deserve any best picture awards or any such thing.  I can see it winning for technical animation for the graphics though.  The dogs are a lot of fun, the story at the beginning is interesting, though the overall story in general is pretty shallow. I would say that the first 3/4 of the movie is very good.  They do seem to make a considerable mistake in the latter part of the film in trying to turn it into a action film.  There are better animated films out there (ie: Toy Story, Meet the Robinsons, The Incredibles, Bolt etc), but Up is an enjoyable enough film, it's just not an all-time great movie or anything, it's a little above average.

B002MTTZ5I|5.0|If you enjoy 80's Hair Metal bands then Steel Panther is for you. They have captured the sound and the attitude perfectly of the late 80's hair band scene without taking themselves too seriously. The explicit content label is well deserved as they sing about what most band merely hint about with their lyrics. Song titles such as \\"Eatin' Aint Cheatin\\", \\"Fat Girl (Thar She Blows)\\" and \\"The Shocker\\" are perfect examples of this. My favorite songs on the disc are \\"Death to all but Metal\\" (great video for this online if you can find it) and \\"Community Property\\" which is a perfect example of the hair metal ballad that will make you laugh out loud. Fans of hair metal do yourselves a favor and give Steel Panther a listen. You will not regret this purchase.

B00005UEAR|2.0|A double album that someone should have picked through for good songs and made one album from. For me Dream Theater are completely hit and miss. This is a terrible miss. Its still got a few good moments. My problem with Dream Theater is that I wish they were instrumental. Their song writing is mediocre at best and I really don't care for most of mister LeBrie's vocals. Of course, prog rock is full of people who can't quite sing good enough for the rest of the music.   In this case, the whole second CD album is so cheesy it sucks. The first CD is ok, but tries to be more than bad prog-metal and fails. Sometimes they try to be Tool. Sometimes they try to be someone else. Dream Theater should try to be themselves more. Its at those moments such, as in Metropolis, that they really shine and the reason I will always give them a listen when they make something new.
B001KVZ6F2|4.0|Ok so the car ..uh kinda cool... but come on .. could have been better.. but the story was very strong. Eastwood is brilliant when it comes to storyline and direction. He is a tough old man that is very prejudice.. it is his struggle to deal with his prejudice in the face of serious injustice. Justice is served in classic Eastwood fashion... I only took 1 star away for the choice of his vehicle and some poor acting with some of the cast..lol but he ties why this car is his baby.. another great Eastwood film.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Previously I thought Unforgiven was his best work, then I pre-ordered this film it is super.  I don't recommend it to anyone who is easily offended, is politically correct, racially sensitive, frowns on swearing or violence.  It is NOT for young children.  There is no sex in it so that's one taboo you don't have to worry about! If you can get past that it a \\"real\\" story about likable characters interacting in a real sort of way.
B002P5XXR0|3.0|The score of \\"Avatar\\" is clearly a great listening experience. After so many years of talking about this film, the task of meeting people's expectations were \\"dantesque\\". James Horner comes very close in satisfying those expectations in terms of music. A great mix of ethnic sounds and more commercial melodies. Some of the themes are haunting and take a even bigger scope when put against the images on the screen.     But i have to make my point on the whole copying thing. Personally, it doesn't bother me. But i can comprehend people who are distracted by it. Even if it's been years, even if it is now a known thing, it doesn't make it more right. It is not because you are tired of hearing the same old critic that it ceases to be relevent.     When you watch a film, the story becomes one with the music. Melodies have a profound effect on one's mind. Music carries memories in a wondeful way. If you are trying to get absorbed by the atmosphere of a movie and you start to hear the notes from another film, it can kick you out of the storyline pretty fast. It was true then, it is true now.     James Horner is unique in that way. I mean, all the composers have their style of music. When Hans Zimmer writes \\"Crimson Tide\\", \\"The Rock\\" or \\"The Peacemaker\\", you recognize his style. Yet, he didn't copy himself directly. Same thing with John Williams if you listen to the themes for \\"Star Wars\\", \\"Superman\\" and \\"Indiana Jones\\" or, let's say, Danny Elfman for \\"Edward Scissorhands\\", the penguin theme for \\"Batman Returns\\" or \\"Scroodge\\". These composers have their influences and it shows in their music which is unmistakably identifiable with their names.    But James Horner?    He copies himself directly (The \\"Casper\\" theme, the \\"Titanic\\" theme, the \\"Apollo 13\\" theme, the \\"Aliens\\" theme, so on and so on). And that is when he's not directly copying somebody else! (The \\"Schindler's List\\" theme for \\"Enemy At The Gates\\" or the \\"Jupiter Symphony\\" of Holst for \\"Braveheart\\", for example).     You are watching \\"Avatar\\" and suddenly, the first three notes of \\"Titanic\\" start to play! How can it not make you laugh? You have to make a mental effort not to think of the sinking boat while watching an alien world... if i was the director, i would want my composer to write original music not heard before. I've worked so hard for my film, i would assume the composer would do the same. Not to say that James Horner didn't work hard, of course. But why recycle your own music? Is it because of a lack of inspiration? Laziness? Lack of talent?    James Horner is a brilliant and gifted film composer. I like him very much. It's a shame that everytime his name will be mentioned, there will always be a \\"but he copies himself a lot and he also copies other artist too\\" after...    In rock music, Jim Steinman (Meat Loaf, Bonnie Tyler, Pandora's Box) does it a lot. But i think it hurts more the composer when it comes to film scoring. Because images and stronger emotions are attached to it. There is a reason why this critic over James Horner's work always resurfaces.     You can be tired of hearing it but it will not stop being true.    But don't let that stop you from buying the soundtrack for \\"Avatar\\". Yes, you will recognize \\"Titanic\\" at some point but if you make the mental effort, you will be rewarded.     James Horner is a great artist of incomensurable talent regardless of this darn bad habbit.
B002T9H2LA|3.0|When Mike Tyson was in his heyday, he had many of his opponents beaten before they even got into the ring.  You see, it was Tyson's reputation that intimidated them.  I believe this is what we have when it comes to Quentin Tarantino's films; it is his reputation for being an \\"auteur\\" that proceeds his releases.  People think this a guy who does \\"out of the box,\\" conglomerations of spaghetti westerns, blaxploitation films, his quirky musical tastes, etc. and mixes it all together-and according to them, out comes a great movie.  \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" is one of those films, BUT closer examination reveals the film does have flaws.  Tarantino gets away with long, boring scenes of dialog building up to a climactic event just because he is, well, Tarantino.  Another filmmaker would simply be taken to task for these trangressions, but we're dealing with a \\"genius\\" here, so he gets a free pass by critics and fans.  IB does have much to crow about: beautiful cinematography, great action scenes (when they finally show up), and good performances, but film is all about timing and pacing, and this is where the movie loses focus.  No doubt Tarantino devotees will say \\"but that is how he does it,\\" but to me and many other moviegoers it's still plodding at a snails pace.  In the end, \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" just moved to slowly for me to really enjoy it.
0815411839|5.0|I found my way to this biography after recently watching   \\"The Asphalt Jungle\\" and \\" All About Eve\\", two films where MM had small, but notable roles. Although I have seen most of MM's movies ( many times), I was suddenly interested to know how she went from these small parts to the starring roles that made her famous.   While I was familiar with the general  facts of her life  before reading this book, I was also familiar with many of the distortions and   speculations that have appeared in the media over the last 30 years, especially in regard to her death. I   chose this book carefully among the many biographies  after verifying the author had documented what he was writing; and verifying the author had some background in researching biographies. I was not disappointed in my choice.     Mr Spoto takes a scholarly approach in compiling the facts, and corroborating the personal accounts of   family, friends, and professional acquaintances. At the same time, the author was able to provide a   lively( maybe a little too lively sometimes) commentary on the facts that developed a believable and   consistent theme to MM's life. It was fascinating to learn the details of Monroe's childhood/adolesence and early forays into modeling and films, not to  mention  the more publicized events  surrounding her stardom and personal travails . I especially enjoyed this book in the historical context of the  depression, WWII and post-war periods of America.  Which leads me to add that the author provides a very insightful ( and not too gossipy) look at Hollywood and the movie business during the time of MM's career.         Although some of the most basic facts of Marilyn's life and career are agreed upon, there are areas of   dispute, most notably surrounding her death, but also in the veracity or extent of personal relationships.  Like any biographer, Mr Spoto  has to often choose whose version of events are verifiable or more reliable. In short, the biographer will necessarily have a point of view. Mr Spoto is no different in this respect, and while he probably has \\"nailed \\" this story down in large part,it does not mean that everything he concludes is indisputable fact.      If your interest in buying this book is to find out what \\"really\\" happened on the \\"final day\\", then you   must be prepared for a hypothesis, a hypothesis based on a careful analysis of the circumstantial evidence, but nonetheless a hypothesis. I am inclined to believe the author's  general thesis on what happened the final day , August 4 1962 , but many people ( and not only the conspiracy crowd) disagree with his conclusions . After almost fifty years, the details of the events on the night of her death will most probably never be verified. The key people( Greenson, Murray, and Engleberg) who are known to have been at the  scene  and could  clarify the inconsistencies have long been dead, and without witnesses or physical evidence  there is no way to corroborate any theories. So don't expect a \\"definitive\\" account of the final day.           However, this book is primarily about Marilyn Monroe's life, and the chapters about her final day exist   to dispel unsubstantiated rumors, and redirect attention away from the \\"sensationalization\\" of her death   back to the story of her life. She was a remarkable person,  and her rise from aspiring model to one of the most recognizable figures in American entertainment/cultural history remains a fascinating read. Well worth the time for a fairly long book.
B001QOGY9K|4.0|Disney's \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" had quite the controversy over the past few months, with many activists crying foul over its contents.  After seeing this film, I believe I have the proper response in regards to its most topical subject:<br /><br />Are the fireflies rightfully depicted in this movie?<br /><br />Short answer, no.  Is this how lighting bugs are viewed in the early 20th century, acting like dimwitted neanderthals with improper vocabulary?  The fireflies back then were an impoverished species, living through the muck and grim everyday of their life.  Many didn't want to live the swamplands, but they were forced to migrate in these harsh conditions.  It took many years of hard work and perseverance for them to be accepted and live among other bugs, and today's generation are treated with an ill-fated 'comic-relief' with an interest in large glowing abdomens?  This is a travesty to Lampyridaes everywhere...but besides that, everything else is safe.<br /><br />When Disney announced that Princess & Frog is going to be a revitalization of the classic animated tale format once upon a time ago, one side of me gleed 'YAY!' while the other side of me declared 'why?'.  To explain my view of the latter, \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" has all the common ingredients of a classic Disney tale: the strong-willed female lead and her contrasting love interest, an unambiguously evil villain, the couple bickering before admitting their loves followed by a kiss, convenient misunderstandings, wacky animal/object sidekicks, and the good ol' fashion tragic death. Disney brought back back the magic, but the company's pulling old tricks.  The film, however, did take the kissing approach to another level when Tiana (voiced by that third Dreamgirls singer) kisses the frog and she turns into one, which when I saw it on the trailer was a pretty good twist; still, it then follows the same recipe.  When I think how the movie \\"Enchanted\\" had clever ideas on the fairy tale formula, this film is a step backwards on the aspect.<br /><br />Nevertheless, all I'm doing at this point is bickering, and there's still a part of me that embraces the film's return to 2-D form.  As a person who grew up during the Disney Renaissance, watching musical numbers with well-animated choreography and vibrant colors, nevermind that some force the plot along like the frog-transformation number, has made my heart flutter like it hasn't for a while; I especially like the Almost There song where the art shifts into different styles.  The movie did a fine job of capturing the energy and wildness of N'Orleans.<br /><br />Praising the look doesn't mean that I'm putting second on story, because that would make me sound like a hypocrite [[ASIN:B001PR0YBM after my last review]].  Although the tale follows a familiar path, it does shift certain gears for the better.  The main message of the film is you should earn your way to make your dreams a reality, rather than just praying for them to happen, which is a positive thing to say to kids.  At the same time, it showcase that too much work can overlook the simple pleasures of life, and when the story pairs up a girl who works too hard and a prince who does nothing, seeing the two work out their opposite traits is effective.  As for the characters, while I have nothing against any of them (including Ray the Firefly, all joking aside), I was surprised by how much I like Tiana's friend, Lotte.  Or rather, I like how the movie depicts Lotte as a spoiled gal who glorifies in romantic fantasies due to her overcaring father, which is an amusing allegory for self-enamored prissy girls of today.  However, she's not just a living social commentary, nor is she viewed as a negative character, as she does shown concern for her friend and support her dreams; her character is pretty refreshing.  Neither of those girls are actual princesses, so to see the story play out the fairy tale from technicalities had a good chuckle from me.<br /><br />Music-wise, I can't say they left an impression on me.  Randy Newman's score fits the tone of the Louisiana setting very well, but the songs aren't really memorable; can't say I have a clear favorite that meant a lot to me.  I'll have to wait a while to see if \\"When I'm Human\\" has a lasting effect like \\"Under The Sea\\" and \\"Hakuna Matata\\".<br /><br />\\"The Princess and the Frog\\" isn't as good as \\"Up\\" in terms of profoundness and emotional input.  It didn't renovate the formula, but then why should it?  It delivered the sensation that has almost been forgotten, and when I saw a child next to me dancing to that witch doctor song, I was reminded that Disney still hasn't lost its touch.  Then again, I also saw a child dance to \\"Alvin & The Chipminks\\", so maybe children are just easy.on me.

1594481717|5.0|In his book, \\"A Whole New Mind,\\" Daniel Pink describes a future where creativity and compassion will be more valued than precision and analysis.  He bases this projection on current business trends including the outsourcing of traditional left-brain tasks to Asia.  Even if you do not believe Pink's labor market forecasts, his advice on right-brain (whole-brain) development is sound.  For decades we have learned how various parts of the brain impact how we perceive and respond to the world.  Scientific and anecdotal evidence indicates that people who utilize more dimensions of intelligence are better able to navigate in an ever-changing world.  As an experienced learning and development professional, I encourage teams to use Pink's enjoyable and easy-to-read book as an employee and team development tool.    * Conduct chapter discussions as part of regularly-scheduled team meetings.    * Ask team members to volunteer to lead discussions of chapters or key ideas.    * Challenge team members to work their way through the design, story, symphony, empathy, play and meaning portfolio chapters.  Eric Hoffer said, \\"In a time of drastic change it is the learners who inherit the future.  The learned usually find themselves equipped to live in a world that no longer exists.\\"  I believe this to be sound advice.  And, I think Pink's book can help.    [...]
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|As Pixar movies go, UP has to be rated with the best of them including Nemo and Wall-E. Between the fabulous animation and artistic beauty, the wonderful casting (Ed Asner as Carl the protagonist), the interesting and captivating story line, and the fun, UP is a joy to watch. It possibly could appeal to older viewers more than young ones since the essence of the story is a man facing the latter part of his life alone after losing his wife and best friend. He had promised her an adventure before she dies and does it in the most imaginative way, lifting his entire house off its foundation with thousands of helium baloons. He WAS a helium balloon sales person at the zoo. Much to his surprise he has a stowaway in the person a young and equally lonely soon to be Eagle Scout. The two of them set out to find Paradise Falls in South America. What they find is much, much more. We saw this movie in theaters with our grandkids, and I just watched it again when the blu-ray arrived. I am sure that I will watch it many more times.

0452289963|2.0|I began this book expecting to be guided on a journey of awakening and enlightenment.<br />I found instead 309 pages of ambiguous, ambivalent blather which could have been expressed in 25 pages or less.<br /><br />The author is incredibly arrogant, proposing that he is in a position to view and describe universal consciousness as well as inhabit the minds of wild animals as they approach death and interpret the teachings of every prophet and teacher who has ever existed. He states in the book that the very activity of reading his book will put you on the path to enlightenment and awareness even if you do not understand what you are reading.<br /><br />The only theme discernible to me is that we are all in unending pain from which there is little hope of escaping or maybe there is -- or not. Paragraph after paragraph proposes some point or issue and promptly negates it in the next sentence. Page after page is replete with ill-defined esoteric terminology which leaves this reader wondering what the author is trying to say.<br /><br />This book is the most negative one I have ever read. It must contain at least half of the negative terminology in the English language. Page after page contains descriptions using words such as: negativity, pain, irrationality, illness, misery, conflict, pathological, corruption, destruction, fear, lack, suffering, condemnation, dysfunction, separation and disease to name but a few. The author splits human consciousness into a multitude of fragments such as: self, ego, consciousness, unconsciousness, pain body, presence, victim, inner body and outer body, never suggesting a way to unite them into a functioning whole. He does suggest that we should stop doing whatever we do to cause our problems, -or not- depending upon our current perspective, or his, or somebody's or who can tell?<br /><br />He fails to comprehend that the ego serves a very legitimate purpose as the interface between our consciousness and the physical world without which we could not function. Problems arise only when we allow the ego to take over functions for which it is ill equiped such as spiritual, ethical, moral and interpersonal relationships.<br /><br />I suggest that this author carries a heavy burden of pain which he is attempting to avoid by passing it on to his readers.we could not function.

B002RSDW80|3.0|This movie is a sad disappointment. In case you haven't heard (and if you are reading this review at all, you probably have heard), it's based on Julia Child's memoir \\"My Life in France\\" and Julie Powell's blog and book about making the 524 recipes in \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" over the course of a year.     I gave it three stars because:  1. of Meryl Streep's delightful incarnation of the late, great Julia Child  2. you can't go wrong filming in Paris   3. it was reasonably engaging for me--but I'm a francophile foodie and Julia's \\"French Chef\\" show on PBS in the 1960s changed my Anglo-Irish meat and potatoes culinary world forever  4. when Julia receives a letter from a prospective publisher at her home in Cambridge, Mass., circa 1960, the filmmakers show the envelope with a two-digit postal code rather than a ZIP code   5. they include Dan Ackroyd's Julia Child skit from Saturday Night Live  6. it reminds me not to crowd the mushrooms.     Now the weaknesses:  1. The Julie Powell character (well-played by Amy Adams) is self-absorbed and tedious and you wonder why her husband loves her; heck, you're not even sure why the cat hangs around   2. The Paul Child character is underdeveloped and although you see that Julia loves him dearly, you can't figure out quite why  3. It does not have enough drama for a drama, and it does not have enough jokes for a comedy   4. They don' show the clip of Julia taking a blowtorch to creme brulee on Letterman  5. How can a story about such a larger-than-life person feel so Cinderella-story-formulaic and pedestrian?    For a movie about haute cuisine, it leaves me feeling about as satisfied as a trip through the Burger King drive-up window. Still, if even one person who sees \\"Julie & Julia\\" recycles Rachael Ray and buys, studies, and gets the courage to start cooking with \\"Mastering the Art . . . \\" instead, it will have been worth it. On a rainy weekend when you've got time, butter and sugar on hand to survive a few mistakes, try the tarte tatin. Don't be discouraged if you burn the sugar the first few times out--you'll get the hang of it.

B0007MW80G|5.0|SINGIN' IN THE RAIN (1952) is a pure delight!<br />All of its songs were composed by that prolific team of Arthur Freed and Nacio Brown, and not just the few sung by the main characters. There's references here to dozens of familiar tunes written by these talented men back in the 1920s and '30s.<br /><br />Kudos to Jean Hagen, who is simply remarkable as the always repulsive, forever screechy Lina Lamont. The character is based on Norma and Constance Talmadge-- Their star-rank careers came to a sudden end with the advent of talkies because both had heavy Brooklyn accents and unpleasant voices.<br /><br />A description here of the movie's most famous sequence, \\"Broadway Melody.\\"<br /><br />In this extended number, the new-to-New York Gene Kelly enters briskly from stage left. He wears a straw hat, striped jacket and black frame glasses and carries a valise as he gaily calls out the opening phrase, \\"Gotta dance!\\" Kelly is then ushered into a fast-paced NY world. He quickly rises from burlesque clown to baggy pants vaudevillian to a tuxedoed gent in the Ziegfeld Follies.<br /><br />Kelly becomes infatuated with the beautiful girlfriend of a gangster (Cyd Charisse in a stunning green gown) and the two perform an elegant fantasy ballet. From here it's all downhill. The small town boy ends up as he started: on the street. Although now clad in a fine suit of evening clothes, the enthusiasm is gone-- he looks mournful.<br /><br />At that moment, another new arrival strides rapidly from stage left. He's dressed just as Gene was when he came to Broadway and he sings out the same \\"Gotta dance!\\" Gene's spirits revive. He happily calls back and the production ends on a high note.<br /><br />The entire story is most entertaining and like all great films, it holds up well. The above sequence is nothing less than stunning and if you've never seen it before, you are in for the rarest of treats.

B000ZELISO|1.0|The audio on the Blu-Ray set was perhaps the worst I have hardly heard.  I should clarify, background and special effects audio was clear as far as I could tell but nearly all the voice audio was unbelievably bad - garbled in many places, muffled in others, too low to hear in other spots - I believe that less than half the voice audio could be understood - incredible, must not have had any test audiences.   AND the movie was so disjointed, and lack of intelligible audio so disturbing that finally the only thing left was to sit back and enjoy the video special effects (exception: try to take a close look at the mid-ground items in the storage room scenes ).
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|I've listend to this CD 3 times in a row now. I love it! She has shown much growth and change on this album. Her albums, starting with Songs in A Minor all the way to As I Am, were very soulful in that old school R N' B styling. But, on this one, she's done some experimenting with synths and other sounds. She pulled it off as only she can, while still maintaining that undeniable Alicia Keys sound. If you are not open to hearing an artist be a true artist, and experiment with sounds and their music, this is not an album for you. If, however, you enjoy hearing an artist grow and change, this is IT!     I love the WHOLE album, but here are my personal favorites (in order)    Love Is Blind - Reminds me of young love and unconditional love, even when it hurts.    That's How Strong My Love Is - Makes me think of my daughter. Yeah, yeah, I know she's singing to a man lyrics go \\"\\"I'll be the woman you need to make you a better man\\", but with a minor tweak, it becomes \\"I'll be the mother you need when you're feeling weak\\" haha.... (I'm a sap, I know!)    Un-Thinkable (I'm Ready) - Sexy mid-tempo track. Makes me wanna light some candels and put on something silky and black.... haha This is a \\"Grown Folks\\" track all day!    This Bed - A nod and a wink to Prince. I love this track! I Grew up on Prince, and can hear his influence everywhere. But so far, only Miss Keys has been able to pull off a Prince-esque sound.    Try Sleeping With A Broken Heart - The lyrics are amazing and heartfelt. Heavy percussion and synth sound, but put together well.    Like The Sea - The lyrics on this track are honest. \\"Love is like the sea/ leaves you on your knees/ first you're floating high/ then it takes you/ takes you under, under...\\" So true.     Just listen to this CD/album with an open mind. Do not expect that old-school sound or neo-soul that Alicia is known for. Expect a different sound.    Also, the album artwork is beautiful..... totally un-related to the music, but I love the artwork.\\"PEACE, LOVE, & SOUL!\\"
B0000033PB|5.0|Can we PLEASE do away with the label \\"progressive rock\\"? Why, you may ask? Because the people who enjoy symphonic rock/orchestral rock/art rock/jazz rock are mostly stuck in the years 1971-77 and are not \\"progressing\\" at all. The amount of abuse and contempt poured on this marvelous album by the band's alleged fans is outrageous, yet understandable considering most apparently want the band to make the same album over and over again to the end of time. Yes, Emerson, Lake, and Palmer made a lot of great music in the above-mentioned years, but they also made a lot of infantile garbage like \\"Jeremy Bender\\", \\"Are you ready Eddy\\", \\"The Sheriff\\", \\"Living Sin\\", and \\"Benny the Bouncer\\". Do listeners really want to return to that? Is the band still competing with King Crimson to determine who are the real \\"bad boys\\" or \\"most esoteric\\"? Where's the \\"progress\\" in \\"progressive\\"?    Black Moon could easily be subtitled \\"Emerson, Lake, and Palmer Grow Up\\". There are 10 outstanding songs with no weak links, excellently produced (credit: Mark Mancina) and passionately performed. All the classic trademarks are here, with a special emphasis on Emerson's Hammond organ. Stop focusing on the track timings and listen to the SONGS. There are dynamic contrasts from nostalgic melancholy to over-the-top intensity. Everything that made ELP one of the best bands of their time is contained on this album. While not as powerful or earth-shattering as 1986's Emerson, Lake, and Powell album, the only other contender for true greatness with Black Moon is their 1971 debut album. Even the booklet graphics (credit: Brass Ring Circus Studios) perfectly encapsulate the autumnal sentimentalism, the fiery drive, and the timeless monumentalism of the music contained within.    Face it, people: there isn't ever going to be a \\"Karn Evil 10\\". Listen to the Black Moon album and let it become part of your life. Thank you, Emerson, Lake, and Palmer for giving us this wonderful music.

079284131X|5.0|I'm not even going to try to think I could even add any new information on my review of 'Child's Play' that hasn't already been said by others.  As a matter of fact, I'm sure there's a review that starts out just like mine haha.  I just want to show my appreciation for 'Child's Play' by adding my two cents into the mix.  As a kid, this movie fascinated me more than it scared me.  Growing up, I loved watching this flick!  I remember scaring my best friend, at that time, with a 'My Buddy' doll while he was spending the night at my house haha.  Good stuff!  I still love to watch this every now and then.  In my opinion, I think it's a shame what the series has turned into.  I've only enjoyed 1+3 and that's it, sad to say.  The first one will always be the best!  Part 2 is fun and part 3, although not as good as 2, still brings a smile to my face!  Brad Dourif is the best!
B00005JN2Z|5.0|This movie has real class, the photography, shot with the viper hi-def camera, is amazing and adds a depth of escapism that I have only found elsewhere in Michael Mann's Miami Vice, shot with the same camera. The colours and the vibrancy of the Los Angeles dusk just made me feel \\"there\\" in a way I can't put my finger on, and combined with the score to create a world I enjoyed losing myself in.     Tom Cruise is looking sharp in an all grey suit, tie and hair combo and brings an air of intensity and offbeat Tyler Durden style to his role, espousing the same \\"live life in the moment and destroy all those pedestrian parts of yourself that hold you back\\" philosophies in between murdering his targets in emphatic fashion. The guy looks good, and carries the main drive of the movie, along with the photography and the music.     Jamie Foxx does a great job of the supporting actor role, and the storyline is a tightly scripted realisation of a good concept: a foreign assassin turns up in LA to carry out five hits between sun-down and sun-up before leaving again never to be seen or heard from, strong-arming a hapless cab driver into being his personal chauffeur for the duration of the operation, or so the plan goes.     Watch out for the completely unscripted and impromptu appearance of a wild dog strolling out in front of the car at a light (the camera just happened to be rolling), it's a special movie moment, and really captures the essence of \\"being there\\", witnessing life as it unfolds, and all that jazz.     Brilliant film. Delivers on all the levels it attempts to, and possibly more.
B001TOVZYQ|4.0|The story of Master Ip is quite the tale and I for one enjoyed it. Though the master does not go through what others may see as character development, one can cheer that he remains a man of integrity inspite of circumstance says volume of a man's character.     But that's not what I'm excited about for this movie and I won't pretend either. It's the fights, the choreography and level was amazing. And in the past years where most kung fu movies have your fighters defying gravity and physics, Ip Man does the opposite. Up to a point where the Master unleashes his skills with such ferocity does not make me cheer but stand there in awe at the raw power. Donnie Yen has outdone himself here. One nitpick is the climatic fight of the film...could have easily been the first fight of the film because it really didn't add anything other than how strong Master Ip really was.    All in all, I enjoyed the film for what it brought and I loved it. Though on the dvd product, the case is pretty flimsy and that should be worked on especially in closing the case with the assurance it's not about to pop open.
B000002GWJ|5.0|I've been a Tom Waits fan since my best friend made me listen to Small Change in our dorm room at KU almost 10 years ago. It wasn't necessarily \\"love at first listen\\" but, rather Tom Waits is like having your first sip of of a great stout...a little bitter at first and not quite sure how to react...but the more you drink it in, the smoother it tastes and your pallet expands to accept this intriguing flavor. Then, before you know it, you are drinking stout beer any chance you get.     Blue Valentine is one of those older Wait's albums that you can put in your player and listen straight through from start to end. The mellowness of his melodic tones gently rakes over his heartbreaking piano and blues-inducing beats. You can hear the streets in his voice and the wisdom in his lyrics. Blue Valentine is a must own for any Tom Waits fan...or stout beer drinker for that matter!
B000ZELISO|1.0|I'll make this pretty short and simple.  This is easily the most uneventful, boring movie of the entire series.  By far.  I would go as far as to say this seemed to be like some sort of dig at Twilight.  Simply because it was so uneventful and boring.  Especially for a movie this incredibly long.  Absolutely no action whatosever.  The Quidish section lasts about 4 minutes and there may be about 15 minutes of action in the title.    You do finally learn how Vuldamort has survived so many times and you learn some other things, and there is of course that big moment at the end, but between all that is nothing.   Absolutely nothing whatsoever.  Y    I had enjoyed all the other movies, but this one had me yawning and looking at my watch for a long time.  And boy was it a long time, two and a half hours nearly of pure boredom.  Not sure what they were thinking with this movie, but it was horrible.

For the next several monthes, up until it came out, i kept thinking about how astounding it would be in HD. And let me tell you, the details were PHENOMENAL. Not to mention Amazon shipped it to me and it arrived the day it was released. Great buy. Comes with three discs, no DVD copy though. Great one to try out the new blu-ray player on. Another that is really spectacular on blu-ray was I Robot. Excellent details. If you like star trek, i recommend this purchase.

B000A0GYD2|5.0|I just finished watching this series last night.  It is, in my opinion, the finest thing (series, mini-series, or tv movie) ever produced for television.  It was stunning.    The best part involves the writing and the decisions made regarding the focus of each episode.  While some of them were obvious (e.g. the episode that focuses on Apollo 11), there were others that were brilliant, such as the episode focusing on the development of the Lunar Module (\\"Spider\\"), the episode on how astronauts were trained as scientists (\\"Gallileo was right\\") and the episode on the wives of the \\"New Nine\\" astronauts (\\"The Original Wives Club\\").    Truly a tremendous accomplishment.    I purchased the \\"Signature Edition.\\"  Not having seen the others, I cannot comment regarding which is better, but this one certainly looked and sounded great on a large wide screen.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|In my perspective this movie es a jumble of things that entertain.<br />You can not believe how the story starts with a very romantic and sad tale about a couple very in loved, and then you see a big strange Sesame Street style bird with dogs talking. O_o<br />Anyway, it reaches its goal.. To etertain you.<br />Now, let me tell you, when a recieved the box, I was so happy to have realy 4 discs.<br />It has 2 blu-rays and 2 DVDs. The movie, one in DVD and de other in blu, bonus in blu and the digital copy.<br />I say this because some movies I bought, had a label with the legend \\"Includes blu-ray and DVD version\\", but it's not true!, it's only one blu-ray and one digital copy.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Dexter fans are reeling from the shocker of a season finale that aired last Sunday Dec. 13th, and rightly so.  Yet for people curious about the show, Season 4 is a great place to start.  Season 4 begins with Dexter adjusting to life as a new dad and a married man.  As a viewer, I didn't want the show to turn into 'Dexter changes a diaper' or 'Dexter Buys Formula' and the writers exposed Dexter to those things and Dexter reacts to them as best and as humorously as he can.  Dexter is still in there, with his Dark Passenger, leading a double life and trying to cope in his own way with new challenges.  It seems like Dexter doesn't do a lot of killing in Season 4, it's more of a tense cat and mouse game leading up to the season finale.  Season 4 stars John Lithgow as father/deacon/volunteer/serial killer Arthur.  A great casting decision as Lithgow can act the gamut of emotions.  His portrayal of the character will perhaps go down as one of the most complex and notorious bad guys in TV or movie history, right along side with Hannibal Lecter (Hannibal had many sides, too).    Season 4 has a movie length plot cut into a serial format.  It's a great place to start for new fans because in a way, the events of the season are clearing the way for Dexter to decide if he wants to be a family man, a normal guy next door or embrace his Dark Passenger once again and without looking back.   Strong performances (as always) from Jennifer Carpenter as Dexter's sister Deb.    The only negative I can comment on is the subplot of the relationship between La Guerta and Batista.  I love Angel but the fling with La Guerta seemed distracting.  Liked him better with the vice detective ;)     For fans who didn't like Season 3, Season 4 will bring them back into the Dexter fold certainly.  Excellent fiction all around.  As Jennifer Carpenter said in an interview w/E Online \\"I hope you have a good time talking to your therapists about it because it's beyond whatever you may think.\\"  Fans of the show are a mix: those who like blood and violence period, those who like the characters and storylines, those who analyze the themes, those who revel in their ability to compartmentalize their reactions and emotions.  However, Dexter is a show that makes you think and in the season finale, it's a show that makes you feel things in your gut, things that you forgot a tv show could make you feel, things that you will be forced to feel whether you like it or not...    Keep up the good work writers!
B000WC39SG|5.0|Overall a great price for a blu-ray and a classic movie. The fact that the editing of the film differs from others had little impact on the purchase. Would be happy to purchase again.
0517548232|5.0|In the face of some pretty strange ideas and solutions put forth that don't seem to add up, Hazlitt's book uses reason and logic to explain why years of top-down management of the actions of millions of people have not succeeded (and why the same failing solutions 'need' to be extended, increased and enforced more violently).      It would be nice if humanity, especially the benevolent people who get into powerful public offices, could tune the market to perfect the supply of goods and services for all so there is no more want.    Someone earned a Nobel prize for explaining how it's just not possible for one or a group of people to know all they need to know to make the right decision for everyone else. Hazlitt explains what happens when one or a few people try to make a decision for the masses, like an import quota or price ceiling.      It's interesting to me that a person can understand and politically agree that intervention in foreign economies, like an embargo or military invasion, will result in unintended consequences that are bad for most everyone (at least us who pay for it) but cannot accept that intervention in our domestic economy has unintended consequences. Some may say these are acceptable, but when the actual effects of polices like welfare, oil and coal subsidies, weapons production, FDIC insurance and anti-trust laws are honestly examined, people deny it.      If you disagree with people who want a smaller federal budget, I still recommend reading this book so you understand what you're actually disagreeing with.
0312370849|5.0|I never would have picked this book off the shelf, but it was recommended to me by a good friend.  I'm so glad I listened.  This was a wonderful book.  The story was great and kept me turning the pages.  I learned a lot about a time in history of which I knew nothing.  Also, having been to Paris this year, it was cool reading about all the places  which I'd recently visited.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone, first, who is interested in WWII and the Holocaust, and two, for anyone who just wants to enjoy a really good story.  Highly recommend it.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|... seems like lady g is already at the point in here career where she calls the shots, and it shows with this, her second album ~ full of heart, passion, beats, craftsmanship, great melodies, and of course, great singing.  can't wait to see her in concert!
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|This cd/dvd combo is exactly what I had hoped it would be. The live concert dvd is really amazing and the cd was a nice perk, I wasnt even aware the two were included together. The sound quality of the first couple tracks of the cd are a little less than steller, but the piano version of Sams Town is fantastic. I suggest this cd/dvd to anyone was has yet to see a Killer's live show and is searching for the next best thing.
B0025KVLV0|5.0|Good remastering of a good album. We were getting used to Let it be naked and one can't help comparing the two versions. In fact the main differences are in the sequencing (maybe Naked is better), the production of I me Mine (Naked is better) Let it be, Across the Universe, The Long and Widding road (good Phil Spector's touch), and the presence of Don't let me down (Kudos for Naked !).    In fact you need both version if you're a fan -and even the Glyn Jones Get back if you can find it.    Here's what would have been an even more tremendous album for me :    Get back (single version)  I dig a poney (let it be)  For you blue (let it be naked)  Two of us (let it be naked)  Let it be (let it be)  Maggie May (let it be)    One after 909 (let it be naked)  I got a feeling (let it be naked)  Don't let me down (single version)  I Me Mine (let it be Naked)  Across the Universe (let it be)  The long and widding road (let it be)      Or :    Get back (single version)  Don't let me down (single version)  The ballad of John and Yoko (single)  Two of us (let it be naked)  For you blue (let it be naked)  Let it be (let it be)    One after 909 (let it be naked)  I got a feeling (let it be naked)  Maggie May (let it be)  Old brown shoe (single)  Across the Universe (let it be)  The long and widding road (let it be)    KInd regards    090909
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Great movie!  Even better, it not only included the Blu-ray dvd but an additional dvd to be used on your PC or Laptop AND an application to download it to your iPod Touch or MP3 video device.  The fourth disc contains extras, making of, etc.  Excellent buy.
1592332803|5.0|Absolutely wondering recipes and great tips.  You will not be disapointed if you purchase this book.  The author has definately done her homework.  Muffins, cookies etc all come out wonderful and my non vegan friends can not tell the difference.  WOW.  GREAT
B0027BOL4G|5.0|To say I was deeply DISTURBED while watching this is an understatement.  I was so angry while watching this, I just wanted to jump into my tv  and strangle every single corporate SUIT that is responsible for enforcing  this HORROR!!!  They should be subjected to the same horrors the workers   and the animals are subjected to, on a daily basis!!! They should be held  accountable and with the swiftest action!  This is why I am a faithful  supporter of companies like PETA and other lesser known animal rights  groups that are fighting for the humane treatment of farm animals.  These   are living, breathing, FEELING beings just like our dogs, cats and horses  etc.  Boycott all things corporate NOW!!!  They are not just killing   animals, they are killing US!!
0439023491|4.0|I absolutely loved Suzanne Collins's Hunger Games. It was one of my favorite books of 2008, and so I was extremely excited to get Catching Fire.  Fans of the first book will enjoy this second book as it continues with many of the same characters and themes from the first. As much as I enjoyed Catching Fire I didn't have the same excitement and love for it as I did Hunger Games.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Strong well drawn characters<br />- Page turning action<br />- A new take at some of the things from the first book<br />- More depth of exploration of the main characters<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Much of the action in the first part of the book happens outside the main narrative<br />- Some of the second half of the book feels rehashed<br />- Just not as exciting as the first book<br /><br />If you've read Hunger Games than odds are you've already picked up and read this book. It's a fine sequel, but it feels like a sequel. If you haven't read Hunger Games, definitely start with that book first. If that captivates you as much as it captivated me odds are you'll want to read this second book and will enjoy it despite some of its faults.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|The book caught my eye when I first saw it.  I read it almost overnight.  If you haven't read the book, I highly advise doing so before you watch the series.  I served in the army infantry and there's nothing that truly captures the spirit and grit of the American soldier or marine of today as this series does.  Ask any infantryman from the army or the marines and they will be the first to tell you that the infantry is nothing like the rest of the military.  It's a hard, dirty, back-breaking, infuriating, and insane way of life, but it's an experience you would never trade for anything else in the world.      I think this series more than anything else captures all of the elements of life as an infantryman.  Everything from the absurd conversations you will have dozens of times over, to the constant wise-cracking you will endure and dish out w/ your platoon, the art of the use of profanity, to the insanity of actual combat.  And more than anything else, it captures the spirit of what the infantry is all about.  I was especially pleased by the use of many military acronyms I had not heard in quite awhile, so it was abundantly clear that the filmmakers had done their homework.    If you're curious about the modern military  or want to have a glimpse of life as an infantryman, or if nothing else, simply want to be entertained, I highly recommend this series.
0385504225|5.0|This is the Dan Brown style of DaVinci Code.  I really appreciate the historical knowledge that he intertwines into a thriller.  It is nice to reconnect with Robert Langdon once again.  The ending does get a bit slow, but it is interesting and good way to close.  I will read again.
B00006I53S|5.0|Great lens.  Usual Canon quality.  I look forward to taking lots of pictures with it.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|My daughter loves the movie UP.  Amazon was a nice place to purchase the product.  I did have some trouble getting a coupon to work right and it took a second customer service agent to correct everything yet once it was done everything work perfectly.  The package arrives a week later.  I use Amazon all of the time and have had no problems.
B000000IVI|5.0|\\"...wasted drug rock?\\" Who signs up the morons that review these CDs? How do you sell a product by tearing it down? Another Goon with a keyboard that obviously knows nothing about the album he's reviewing. And Hendrix comparisons? My God! I find much of Henrix' catalog to be unlistenable, and to me, it hasn't stood the test of time. He was Robin's contemporary. When I listen to Trower I hear another guitarist altogether, one who was not dropping Acid or LSD for inspiration. Hendrix was all right but if he somehow survived today he would be a complete burn out by now. The man is 70 years old and has had a career in music for over 40 years now and he's referred to like some kind of hack!  Yet he is still to be haunted by the ghost of a man who died, oh lets see, 40 YEARS AGO?!! Some ranting? Yes , the reviewer set me off. Trower deserves better!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|excellently put together film,that brings back memories of the original series.I would buy another if a sequeal was made.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|Alica Keys is at her best in her newest album.  I've listened to this album over 15 times all the way through. I love it. I am a 19 year old male who mainly listens to the Best Hip Hop only. Nas, Pac, Big, Pun, Em, Wu-Tang, Ez. However, Alicia always caught my attention somehow. This album is the perfect mix of strength, passion, and vulnerability. Soft Slow songs. Upbeat ballads, and a couple absolute bangers (as far as Alicia Keys goes). I love this album, and it is the first Alicia Keys album I bought. Any music fan will appreciate at least 4 songs on this album. Hip Hop and R&B fans this cd is a must. Really nice production and the bass hits just right in just the right number of songs. One of the best albums this year and I give it a 5 out of 5, which is a very hard coming from me. I love this album and I hope you will too.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|If you appreciate great sound quality and love the Beatles as much as I do, snap this up while you still can. The 24-bit FLAC files on this surprisingly heavy little bauble sound amazing. I had been overwhelmed with the quality on [[ASIN:B002BSHWUU The Beatles Stereo Box Set]], but these 24-bit files reveal even more detail. I can hear picks hitting strings; bass drums are more audible, the voices sound like they are in the room. Buy it. I'm serious.
B000002UAU|5.0|It's one thing to contribute art and/or entertainment that is popular at a particular time, but these come and go at will, often replaced by work that is just updated offerings of the former. The vast majority of top-40 pop tunes come under this category where the next decade's songs are simply updated versions of the last decade with a different beat. The next level of aspiration is to create contributions that transcend popularity within its era, in other words, something that withstands the test of time--works that express something that can't be replicated. Artists as diverse as JS Bach, Mark Twain, Vincent Van Gogh and Led Zeppelin fall under this category. Among these elite artists, how many artists can boast creating works that not only transcend the test of time but literally define a generation and an era? Very few. F. Scott Fitzgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is one. Mark Twain's \\"The Gilded Age\\" may be another, and Jack Kerouac's \\"On the Road\\" may be yet another. And in music, the Beatles' \\"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" may the musical equivalent of a Kerouac or Fitzgerald. Pepper not only defined a generation, it may have helped invent it. Even the album cover's rhetoric speaks of a shift in the sensibility of the pre-boomer and boomer generations. The Fab Four were no longer sporting short haircuts, jackets and thin ties singing about holding a girl's hand. They gave themselves facial hair while decked out in 19th-century satin uniforms, and they are no longer singing about innocent teenage love. Much of The Beatles' earlier work was single-dimensional aimed to please young teenagers at proms. Now, their work had grown into a deeper subtlety that became an anthem and a symbol for the 1960's generation.<br /><br />The music of \\"Sgt Pepper\\" includes a range of subjects that would have been unthinkable only a few years earlier when they appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show for the first time: psychadelics, relationships, intraspections, and social issues. Some of the songs are of such an abstract nature, such as \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\", and \\"The Benefit of Mr Kite\\", that they could not be pigeon-holed within the boundaries of acceptable popular culture; they were giving voice to the 1960's subculture or counterculture that had begun around 1965. The definitive answer as to how these songs are to be intrepretted is nonexistent which is the highest aspiration of art. I don't think even the Beatles knew exactly what their music was saying, and that's the beauty of Sgt Pepper. They were saying something that may have transcended their artistic objectives.<br /><br />There were a few musical artists of the mid-1960's who were stunned with the release of Sgt Pepper. Here was a band who had made millions with their early records who ventured outside of the arena of simple popular culture. They did the unthinkable. They took rock 'n' roll and pushed into high art and high culture. \\"Pepper\\" did win album of the year at the Grammys of 1968, but none of its individual songs won any awards. (\\"Up, up and away\\" won best song, but who listens to that anymore?) Before Pepper, most of the counter-culture music was simply ignored by the Grammy Awards.

B002QH2NUA|2.0|McCartney's embracing of his Beatle music when his middle age allowed his self-importance to embrace the past - a wise move and one we have all appreciated tremendously - has reached a point of diminishing returns. I can't say what this set will do for you if you were there; that's a different emotional relationship with the music herein. But for those of us, myself included, who were not, it's yet another rendering of the tired old hits that still sound best in their original form. As usual, he has dragged out a few numbers that have never before been performed, post-Beatle days, e.g. Paperback Writer and I'm Down, but really, who needs yet another version of Hey Jude, Let It Be, Yesterday, etc.? His voice, though still recognizably Paul McCartney, is conforming to the biological imperatives of age and let's face it, the concerts don't get better as he approaches 70, although his being out there still playing may be worthy of a different type of respect and admiration.    But what REALLY infuriates me is what he did to A Day in the Life. In cutting off the final section, thus ruining the entire form of the song, and segueing into Give Peace a Chance, he has resorted to cheap, crowd pleasing manipulation and undermined the integrity of one of the Beatles' all-time best songs - definitely a song worthy of taking seriously and presenting in its glorious entirety. It's purely showmanship over musical integrity and he deserves to be called out on it.
0312944926|4.0|Digital Fortress by Dan Brown is one of his earlier works.  I expected something similar to The Davinci Code or Angels and Demons.  However, this book has a whole different storyline.  Brown involves the reader in the mysterious world of spies and encrypted messages.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something by Brown that is not meshed in the religious plot's that we have come to expect of Brown..
B0013FXWU6|3.0|3.3 stars<br /><br />Who edited this thing, or rather, didn't? It just draaaags at many points. Some might call it sweepingly epic, though the term pointlessly overblown also applies. Considering the hype, I'd call it the most overrated movie I've seen in years.<br /><br />The real dealbreaker for me was the music, which is horridly manipulative from the very start, portending doom during simple expository shots and generally calling notice to itself all the time. I love a good score, but only when it fits hand in glove with the movie. This stuff is more like foot on hand.<br /><br />Lewis is the highlight, and he is indeed excellent, making us care about a man who's not very worthy of much love. Upton Sinclair's story is somewhat overdone here, though; despite some fine moments, I just stopped caring about what happened to whom about 90 minutes in, and knowing we were in for another 70 minutes was somewhat sigh-inducing.<br /><br />Which is too bad, as this film would have wowed me if cut to about 100 minutes, or at most two hours. But maybe that's just me. I'd heard so much for so long that I expected too much and got much less than hoped for. Excepting Lewis, always a treat to watch.<br /><br />Nonetheless, there is no way I'd want to see this again for a year or three, even for a barrel of oil.
B0029RQE84|3.0|I have been a Mark Knopfler fan since the days of Dire Straits and continued since his debut solo \\"Golden Heart\\". In \\"Get Lucky\\" the album is good on overall. The title track is very strong & expected from this talented artist. 5 other songs are just ok. The album as a whole is a disappointment as I was expecting stronger songs like those from my favourite releases \\"Golden Heart\\" or \\"Sailing To Philadelphia\\". The man of his talent & experience can certainly offer a better product! He will have to redeem himself with his near perfect live shows \\"Get Lucky\\" tour performances! Extra/bonus DVD has Mark Knopfler taking photos (what were you thinking?) as well as going through the studio (much better) & live performances of \\"Cleaning My Gun\\" & \\"Remembrance Day\\".
B001FB55I0|3.0|Lots of action and thrills here, if not enough decent acting. But that's hardly the point of this franchise, and on that level T4 delivers. The script is ok, and the basic concept is a good one. If all you want is some high-tech whiz-bangery, this should do it.<br /><br />Disconcertingly, at various moments in the film it's not easy to know if Christian Bale is man or machine; his somewhat wooden style is almost uber-ironic here. But McG continues to deliver the goods, visually, though this one feels somehow hollow, despite excellent effects. T4, while better than T3, never approaches T2. But then again, James Cameron has rather more of a sense of humor than McG.<br /><br />Worth watching after you've seen T2 three or four times, perhaps.
B002ECJZ76|4.0|Most people will skip this Finnish holiday film, dubbed in English, searching for something more familiar, something less challenging. That's a mistake.<br /><br />This is an excellent family film about the origin of Santa Claus. This film transcends the commercial image of Santa and grounds him in a loving story that isn't afraid to make you cry.<br /><br />The word \\"classic\\" is used too often to describe holiday films, each of lesser and lesser quality. Hollywood has a lousy record when it comes to holiday films over the past decade. For example, [[ASIN:B000OLGCIE The Santa Clause 3 The Escape Clause]] (2006), [[ASIN:B000UX798I Deck the Halls]] (2006), [[ASIN:B0007A0F4E Christmas With the Kranks]] (2004), [[ASIN:B0006JMLPM Surviving Christmas]] (2004), and, most recently, [[ASIN:B000VKKV30 Santa Baby]] (2007) and [[ASIN:B001CTA1UM Four Christmases]] (2008). And that doesn't count other holiday lumps of coal starring Tom Arnold, Kelsey Grammer and Matthew McConaughey.<br /><br />My point is that this film, with its snowy lush cinematography and original storyline, isn't without its flaws. However, you will come away feeling inspired by the result, rather than feeling cheated once again by another made-for-TV plot, lame acting and sophomoric humor.<br /><br />Jen Johans' review for Film Intuition does an excellent job of capturing what makes this foreign film so special. The following excerpt nicely sums up why you should give the movie a chance:<br /><br />\\"However, despite its melancholic opener and general audience reluctance to foreign films, this uplifting PG-rated movie is one I urge parents to seek out to offer a new alternative to the primarily commercial approach of Santa Claus movies.<br /><br />\\"A beautiful work filled with the ingredients that make our classics including A Christmas Carol, Nutcracker and other holiday movies so endearing, director Juha Wuolijoki's Story also garnered prestigious accolades in time for its DVD debut including a seal of approval by The Dove Foundation and an All-Star honor by the well-respected Kids First! Coalition for Quality Children's Media.\\"<br /><br />Rating: Four stars.or by the well-respected Kids First! Coalition for Quality Children's Media.\\"    Rating: Four stars.
0312360266|3.0|This is my first book review so I hope I am not all over the place. I would have like to have seen something on the book about not being appropriate for young teens. At the ripe of age of 61 I am about as far from a prude as you can get but to me some of the language and content in these books were unnecessary. The storyline would be fine(maybe even better)without it. Guess I am spoiled by the \\"clean-cut\\" language in the Twilight,Vampire Diaries,Night World and Dark Visions books.I know Cast said she used her daughter to help her make sure the teens \\"talked\\" like teens but enough is enough.It also seemed to me that way too much space and time was taken up with repeat information. Maybe she intended for each book to stand alone but again,enough is enough. These were just not the Vampires I have come to know and love. That said,I kept reading and I am now on book #4. I will finish the series(yes,I have to see how it turns out....LOL)but I am not sure if I will recommend it to anyone and I will definately not be lending them to my young teen granddaughter as I have the other group of books. I see where Cast has books out that appear to be about Witches. Maybe that is where she needs to stay and leave the Vampires to other authors.
B001W79MBI|4.0|Thank you so much for the dvd, it's a truely great movie and it arrived in great condition!
B001ILFUDM|5.0|This Blu-ray edition is so much better, it's only like a dollar more than the regular DVD one.  First, there are three disc; the first disc is a Blu-ray of the movie, the second disc is a Blu-ray of bonus features, and the third disc is a DVD of the movie with features.  You're basically getting the movie twice (on Blu-ray and DVD); I was very please when I found that out, especially since the price is so insignificant to the regular DVD one.  So I kept the Blu-ray disc of the movie, and then I sent the DVD version to my son (he doesn't have Blu-ray anyway, and I don't need two versions of the movie).  Also, wow, the technicolor is so amazing!!!  I wish that they still made movies in technicolor.<br /><br />But I digress - anyway, true to all of its marketing advertistment, it is true, colors are restored and remastered in its brilliant technicolor format (you wouldn't even need a HDTV; I have one, but you wouldn't need one, that's how good the colors are).  The sound is also incredible, the movie volume came across louder than my cable channels; I had it on volume level 25 when I was watching TV, and when I put the movie in, it was so loud I had to lower the volume to 12 - great sound!
B001E75QH0|5.0|These films (even the fourth one) are great and I think people are WAY too critical on some of them.  Just shut up and enjoy them.  The fourth one is entertaining and there are one or two parts in it that are highly untruthful ( a certain refrigerator scene).  The first one is classic, the second is good, the third one is my personal favorite.  They are all good and it was a great price, cheaper than most other places.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I was very disappointed with this latest book by Brown....it needs about 100 pages edited out....what a grueling read.
0671835467|5.0|I am delighted it got my 13 year old daughter reading, and in todays hi tech world were everything is digital, that can not be a bad thing.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Got a terrific deal on the Blu-ray 4 Disc Combo pack.  It arrived rather quickly after the order was placed within 4 days and it was brank new in it's original packing when it arrived.  I love to find great deals on-line.
B001FB4VXU|4.0|Item was delivered on time and in good condition.  The series season was great!
B0024FAR5W|5.0|You know I loved the Sopranos, except for season 6 and the worst series finale in TV history. Sons of Anarchy blows away any show out there and is 10 times better then the Sopranos. My kids turned me on to the show midway during the 2nd season. I ordered the blu ray of season 1 and i watched the whole thing in one day!!! The writers, producers , producers and creator are brilliant!!! Trust me it will have you hanging on the edge of your seat! Season 3 which won't start till sept. 2010 won't come soon enough!!!
0385340990|4.0|The author weaves us into the beings of these Guernsey islanders, their present lives and past history with the threads of letters.  By the end of the book the charachters feel like old friends that you hate to leave.
0375413405|5.0|A classic is something done so well it stays current over time and this is simply a classic and basic for any cooks reference library.
0385504225|5.0|This thriller is just as exciting and even more believable than some of his earlier ones.  I thought I knew Washington, D.C., pretty well, but he opened my eyes to some new facts.  Should be of interest to men, women, young and old.  but be prepared for an all-nighter.  Once you start, you can't stop.  Loved it!
B0017HMF6W|5.0|I have been burned several times on \\"new\\" blu-ray editions of old movies. The picture quality ends up not looking much better than the regular DVD. NOT true with North by Northwest. The picture quality is SPECTACULAR! If you love this movie, it is worth upgrading to blu-ray. I noticed so many details I have never seen before (and I've seen this movie many times). Enjoy.
B002XG1OUE|5.0|This is mainly in response to the previous 1 star review. This is a collectible item. As such, it is worth whatever someone is willing to pay for it. I was at Target yesterday and this edition is long gone. The packaging is very cool - a model of the Enterprise that contains the DVD in the \\"disk\\" portion of the ship. If you're a Star Trek fan, and liked the new movie, this is a cool item.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|Leon is a great movie that has stood the test of time. It's great to see it on Blu-ray at last. The glue that holds the film together is the relationship between Leon and Matilda but Gary Oldman steals the show with a wonderfully OTT performance as the corrupt cop on their tail.  There are some great special features on the disc too.
0307454541|1.0|I don't why this book could ever be a best seller, perhaps people bought it, (like myself), only to discover that it's lacking in suspense and \\"thrills\\" are the farthest this book could ever achieve.<br /><br />One thing that I found completely disappointing was how Larsson made a laundry-list of \\"who-done-it\\" characters, but then introduces them to you in a \\"to-do\\" list kind of way. After that hundred pages, I found myself disappointed with how non-descriptive all the surroundings were described to the point where the location felt alien to me. On top of that, there was a whole stagnant interlude where no progress was made on the whole point of this book! I admit, it went in a entirely different direction than I expected upon first picking up this book, but at what cost? The final pages felt like a \\"wrap it up\\" ending with no sense of climax or satisfaction.<br /><br />This time I recommend even the \\"finish what I start\\" type readers to save themselves the time.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This series was a breath of fresh air for television. Looks stunning on bluray. Highly recommend this series!

SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!  Also that kid from that show the OFFICE is in this movie and it's so hilarious to see him in it because he's such a LOOSER on the office but in this movie he isnt a looser he a cool dude and he lives all the way to the end even thou lots of the bastards die before the movie over.  I usually don't like history films but this was obveously one of the most coolest portrayals of how WWII ends and how AMERICA kicks A$$ and don't mess with us because we will beat you with a BASSBALLBAT!!!!!!!!  So maybe I am maturing and grwoing up and now I like histry movies maybe next I will check out Titantic and see some more histry.     BEST WAR MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1577314808|5.0|This book is well worth it. I am not big on reading but every once in a while when I go vacation I pick a self help book to hopefully get through. I hit the jackpot this time. I was impressed on how easy it was to read but also how much useful information was packed into it. In fact I bearly finished it because I had to read slowly and spent much time pausing to reflect on its powerful message. It has one basic message. It teaches you to live for the moment,forget about the past that's gone forever and the future that never arrives. Tolle repeats this message over and over in so many various ways to help you really grasp it. I recommend it to anyone not living in moment to moment bliss which covers most of us.
B000EXZKQM|5.0|I LOVE it !!  CD and DVD,  the price is GREAT.. quality is fantastic.  Love all the music it in it..
B000WC39SG|4.0|An excellent movie to watch over and over again. Blue-Ray quality isn't at its best, picture looks faded and lack of contrast. If you already have the DVD copy, don't need to buy again.
0810983915|5.0|i think that amazon is a great way to shop it is fast and very prompt.thank you so much for being there for people like me i have a liver diease and waiting on a liver and sometimes i just can not get out.
B000JVSUS4|5.0|I always love this movie on DVD and the Blue-Ray quality just make it perfect! The resolution and sound are a lot better, the war scenes feel so real.
B002T9H2LA|1.0|Okay, I have already written one review of Inglourious Basterds.  But I got a bunch of nasty comments from QT lovers, so I'm going to try again.  I didn't like this movie for a few reasons.  Scratch that, I just hated this movie.  The way the movie was marketed was totally misleading.  I thought it was going to be a WWII action movie staring Brad Pitt.  It is actually a very long, at times slow paced revenge movie.  Other than the last half hour there is hardly any of the usual over the top violence that is present in Tarantino's other movies.  And Pitt is only in it for maybe 30 minutes total.  I don't have a problem with sub titles, normally.  But in this case they were hard to read.  And half the fun of a Tarantino movie is the dialogue.  Having to read it just took the fun out of it.  I really liked Tarantino's first three movies.  And I know I'm in the minority here, but my favorite is Jackie Brown.  I think it's my favorite because it is based on a book by Elmore Leonard.  I like the way QT changed certain things but still told the story well.  Anyway, I'm not a fan of Tarantino's last few movies.  I wish he would go back to making movies like Pulp Fiction or Jackie Brown.  Instead of gimmicky crap like Grindhouse, or alternative history like Inglourious Basterds.   You can make all the nasty comments about me that you want to.  That is my opinion of this crappy movie.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Love this CD! I would definately order any other CD's Susan Boyle records. She has the most beautiful voice I've ever heard! Every time I listen to her sing, it brings tears to my eyes and joy to my heart. What more can I say?
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|The quality is very good. I had seen just one of the Star Trek movies previously. This is a great way to see them all and not break the bank. Highly recommended.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This was my first Blu-ray purchase, and I love it.  The video quality is far better than anything else I have seen, and the narrations to go with the moving pictures are educational.  This is something that will be watched more than once.
B002QGUFWE|1.0|I can't belive that people think this is music her voice is edited the music and beat generated and no talent whatsoever.  She is a corprate creation made to sell and use people.  It is just awful music.  I'm waiting for the day when people will relize that this music is crap.
1416594787|5.0|I was confident before that evolution was the correct theory toward explaining the diversity of life on Earth. Now, after reading \\"The Greatest Show on Earth,\\" it really hit it out of the park. It is a tour de force including some of the most recent evidence but also including some classics examples.    The author begins with a description of evolution and goes into logic theory. It's a bit pedantic, but necessary, in order to lay the theory out for the novice. Dawkins then tackles evolution by way of describing artificial selection to show natural selection. He uses perhaps the most famous example of artificial selection: dog breeding. He even shows that in just a few generations wild foxes can be bred to become tamer. I like that Dawkins started off with describing dog breeding. So much surrounding the evolution debate is about millions of years and random mutations. Yet, all breeds of dogs happened within the last few thousand years and almost all were the result of diversifying a gene pool, not genetic mutation.    Dawkins is good at pointing out many things that are evidence for evolution that the general reader could ponder. A couple examples: why don't whales have gills; why don't bats have feathers. That, Dawkins points out, is evidence for evolution because a creator would (one would think) be engineering minded and create the best possible being. In another chapter he quashes intelligent design by pointing out how poorly designed some living structures are. Examples include the human eye (yes, that \\"bastion\\" of design for any creationist) and the laryngeal nerve in giraffes (it goes from the brain down the entire length of the giraffe's neck and back up before going to the larynx!)    Even with such unintelligent design, surely there must be a designer to create that--it can't happen on its own, right? Dawkins addresses that extensively in one chapter, showing how chemical interactions on the micro level (DNA, enzymes, etc.) create macro beings such as humans. Truly a fascinating chapter.    Above, I reviewed Dawkins's treatment of artificial selection and dog breeding; change that has occurred within the last few thousands of years. But Dawkins goes one step further: showing real evolution that's happened within a human lifetime. One of the best chapters in the book \\"Before our very eyes,\\" details experimental verification of evolution in the lab. Dawkins goes into detail of an experiment whereby several thousands of generations of E. Coli were evolved, the resultant being they became more efficient at eating glucose. Another experiment dealt with the sexual selection of guppies in ponds with various degrees of predation.    The last couple chapters aren't as good as the others. \\"Arms races and `evolutionary theodicy'\\" deals with the notion of survival of the fittest and how one cannot justify both a benevolent intelligent designer with the suffering of life in the evolutionary \\"arms race.\\" Dawkins talks in generalities without citing any specific experiments and a few times he repeats simple ideas that are obvious. The last chapter is simply a parsing of a passage in \\"The Origin of Species\\" and is of little worth. Maybe Dawkins had to find a way to conclude his book.    \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\" isn't for everyone. Obviously, devote creationists would view it similarly to pornography: the work of Satan. The more liberally minded Christian might find this convincing, but the other topic Dawkins is well known for--atheism--might turn away that crowd. And frankly, in my opinion, if one accepts evolution one hundred percent, there's not much left for God to do. The people who gave this book one star probably from the get-go did not intend to have their beliefs questioned. This book is more for those who have already accepted evolution as fact, or those who are open-minded. For those, this book is a must read. For the others, don't even bother. You can't handle the truth.
B002R0F3Q2|4.0|Another work of art that AGAIN shows that this beautiful talented singer continues to do HER thing with little care or concern for keeping up with the pop trash that is polluting our airwaves.  It shows growth, development and maturity which surpasses all of her peers and again reminds us that Alicia Keys will be around in 20 years when many of her contemporaries have crashed and burned.    However, I have deducted a star out of dissappointment that someone as gifted as Miss Keys could sully a work of art by collaborating with the ubiquitous Ms Knowles.  \\"Put it in a love song\\" is right up there with The Cheeky Girls or J Lo's \\"I'm still Jenny from the block\\".  This three minutes and 15 seconds of vapid, insignificant nonsense is typical of the type of music we all come to expect from Beyonce - \\"What up A, what up B, text me on your cell phone blah blah blah\\" - Uggh !!!! Just horrid.    Otherwise, the album is a beautiful collection of thought provoking catchy beats and ballads.  Turn the lights out, get a glass of wine on these cold, dark, wintry evenings, sit back and enjoy.    Miss Keys, once again - I salute you.
0812973992|5.0|Let the Great World Spin has many layers going on within it.      On the top layer, it is a book about New York in one moment in its long, difficult history, the 1970's.  This was a time of urban decline for our Big City, rapidly emerging class distinctions, grinding poverty and desperation, and increasing emotional and economic distance between New York's residents.  This theme is brillantly laid out in a series of snapshots of the urban situation, each of them perfectly drawn.      In the next layer, one that unfolds relentlessly and almost silently, these strands draw closer together, providing the novel with its momentum and power.  We become aware of the randomness of events that draw human lives together.  The pieces fit together beautifully: an Irish social worker with a driven sense of the power of religion to change lives, prostitutes, a Park Avenue socialite reaching for a deeper meaning to life, children of privilege who have descended into confusion, and, above it all, a most fantastic tightrope walker.    It is he, the tightrope walker, whose long, langorous walk in the sky above the World Trade Towers, provides the real glue, the most important layer, in the story.  This single act of daring and danger transfixed New York, all of its citizens, in one magical moment in those distant 1970's.  New York was presented with a phenomenal act of achievement, soaring high above the ground, alone, contemptuous of authority, detached from all the rules of urban life, thrilling in the frightening challenge to normality.  This, in a sense, is the story of this novel.  Colum McCann does what few novelists in my 60 year history of reading fiction have done: this book speaks louder and louder to us as it proceeds; it provides us with a picture of what really is happening all around us in life as we draw together and apart, as we try so hard to find our way, alone most of the time but in the end very much together.      I had never read anything by Colum McCann but this has to be the first of many others that i shall read.
032147404X|5.0|Book didn't come as soon as I had hoped but when it arrived I was very satisfied.
B002KSPKRS|1.0|If you want to chat with friends, do not buy these. If loud cracking and popping at random times bothers you(even at low volume), do not purchase the X41 system.     The sound quality (when not cracking and popping loudly) is good. However, when chatting with friends they cause major feedback and echoing for your friends. I had to use the original xbox headset at the same time as the X41 system (with one ear to the X41 and one ear to the original xbox headset), which completely nullifies the reason for purchasing this system. Also, the \\"auto-adjust\\" on volume was horrible. There were times I could not hear friends over the sound of the game (MW2); and then, all of the sudden, they would be too loud (not to mention they couldn't even listen to me because of echoing and feedback).    Basically, if you have to have wireless headphones and you are only going to be playing by yourself (not chatting with anyone in game) and you don't mind loud cracking and popping (even when you aren't plugged into the controller), then these overpriced sub-par headphones are what you're looking for.
B001F0RA4S|3.0|The writing is great to the point that it is just too much.  You have long flowing paragraphs filled with description after description.  None of it's really necessary.  The story was intriguing, and the last 40 pages or so kept me reading until the end.  But take away the fluff, and what you have is a completely mediocre book.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|Although I had already downloaded this season from iTunes, I went ahead and got the DVD set for overall picture clarity and the extras that come with each episode. While many episodes are labeled 'director's cuts', I didn't notice much new or extra content. The transfer is crisp and clean and the shows look terrific. For me the real gem of the set were the little five minute shorts before each episode, interviews with Dave Filoni and Killian Plunkett and the sound team; these were excellent, interesting, and fun, and I began to look forward to them even more than the episodes sometime into disc three. Especially at the price Amazon offers this set for, it's well worth your investment.
B000I2J6K0|2.0|I was so excited to try out this video, but I have to say I was very dissapointed.  After the reviews I read I thought this was going to be a good workout.  I don't think I broke a sweat once during the entire thing.  I could have folded the laundry and had a better workout.  I was 17 weeks when I tried this and running has become difficult with all the trips to the bathroom and some round ligament pain.  I think this video is meant for people who eiether have never done any type of exercise before or who are in their 7th or 8th month of pregnancy.  I am used to running about 20-30 miles a week so if you are expecting a good heart pumping workout from this you are going to be very dissapointed.  Go for a fast paced walk instead.  The quality of the video was fine and the music did not bother me.  I have also purchased the video with Karen S, but have not tried it after I wasted 40 minutes on this one.
160094048X|5.0|I've tried 3 of the recipes so far, and all are excellent. The oatmeal cookies have great flavor. It amazes me that cookies with such simple and mostly healthy ingredients taste so good. The Cowboy cookies are fabulous. I like this book so much, I bought a copy for my daughter. She loves it too.
0307346617|5.0|I loved this book, a lot of it was based on real facts.    (except the zombies of course)    The book is basically a collection of made up interviews that together tells the plot of the outbreak of a world war where the enemy is zombies, a fearless enemy who's ranks swell as humanity's numbers dwindle. It goes so far as to push humanity on the brink of extinction.    It is a dark book, and told in a really realistic way too, and the ending was really done well, not just a jip off typical zombie ending.    I much rather prefer this book then Stephen King's Cell, a book about zombies too. (although I also enjoyed that book too, because I am fascinated with the idea of zombies)    Apparently both books are becoming movies.    I defnitely recommend this book for a good read, and don't be surprised if you learn something deeper within it's texts about human nature and the world in general and am at the same time wildly entertained throughout the process.
0812974611|5.0|This is an excellent book.  Very factual, but easy reading.  On the edge of your seat kind of book.
0515125024|4.0|Much of what I read on my daily commute to work is for entertainment and let's face it, Lee Child entertains with Jack Reacher. Reacher's the larger than life go to guy of fictional characters, the modern cowboy righting wrongs and riding or walking off into the sunset.<br />  In DIE TRYING Lee Child gives us a kidnapping of an FBI agent and Reacher who just happens to get caught up in the mix. There's a right, far right militia to contend with, some bad guys in interesting places and enough action to make a daily commute in the rain tolerable.<br />  This is the second book in the popular series and the more I read, the more I don't mind my commute so keep writing Mister Child, I'm too young for social security.
B002T9H2LA|3.0|NOT A BAD MOVIE BUT A TYPICAL QUINTAN TARENTINO STYLE FLICK. EVEN HARVEY KEITEL HAD A VOICE OVER ROLE. I PURCHASED IT TODAY, WATCHED IT ONCE AND I'M SELLING IT. IT'LL NEVER BE A CLASSIC KEEPER.
B000H5U832|5.0|Cars is another winner from the combined efforts of Disney and Pixar. Anyone who watches this movie will be able to relate to a character, from the spiteful Hudson Hornet/Doc Hudson to the easygoing Mater. A star studded cast of voice actors gives this film recognizable voices for anyone. Some of the actors are: Paul Newman (one of my favorites in this film), Owen Wilson (Marley and Me, Drillbit Taylor, Night at The Museum), Larry the Cable Guy, (another one of my favorites) and John Ratzenberger, who has appeared in all the Pixar film and plays his most prominent role in this one. The general gist of the movie is a stuck-up rookie racecar, namely Lightning McQueen, getting arrested in a small Route 66 town called Radiator Springs, where life is mostly about trying to passing through tourist to buy something from one of the characters stores. Over the course of the movie, you find that the town doctor was the best racecar around in his younger days, but had a big crash that ended his career. He know does not want anything to do with the racecar that comes to town. McQueen learns the importance of slowing down and enjoying the ride on the Highway of Life. He helps everyone in the town, and even restores the 60's neon lights in the town. Also, he falls in love with the town attorney, a 911 Porsche. But the best part is the end, when McQueen has a chance to win the Piston Cup, but instead helps one of the greats (called \\"The King\\" in the movie and modeled after Richard Petty's Plymouth Firebird and voiced by Petty himself) finish his final race. This movie has the best moral of any of the Pixar movies. An added bonus is all the retro cars, from a Model T to a 50's Chevy Impala. Plus there are some great punch lines as with all the Pixar movies. I've saved the best part of this movie for last. The soundtrack is simply awesome. Featuring Rascall Flatts, Sheryl Crow, and Brad Paisley, I would rate it as one notch below the soundtrack of [[ASIN:B0006GAOGI Rocky IV]], which has the best soundtrack of all time. Overall this is a phenomenal film. HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED!!!!has the best soundtrack of all time. Overall this is a phenomenal film. HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED!!!!
B001N44BVQ|3.0|watching this movie is like watching the evening news - full of distortions and exaggerations, demonization of muslims and islam, violence, even mildly boring.  Same old same old.  Only thing holding this movie up are the actors.
B001O3XKLI|4.0|The product seems to be in good condition, sealed in plastic. My concern is that is came from Argentina, and even though all printing is in English, it clearly states on several places on the cover that it came from Argentina. This made me wonder if the singing would be in English or Spanish. Like I said, it seems to be fine, but it did make me uneasy and I did not know prior to placing the order that it would be coming from another country.
B002T45VX6|3.0|Shakira is an unusual creation.  A great looking woman with genuine talent, and I suspect there is a real and good person in there.    Therefore, following Fixation II v1&2 this album is a huge let-down.    Gone are the excellent band she had, instead most of the rhythms sound like they are created on her laptop with a few overdubs of percussion and vocal affects added at the studio to try add some interest.  A couple of the tracks are almost good.    On the plus side her vocals are still great and unique, and the lyrics are her own quirky lyrics.    But musically this is to me a rather uninteresting effort.  She can do so much better.  Maybe next time.    CD-technical quality wise , this is just another piece of volume maximised garbage, but then aren't all new releases?
B002Q4U9YU|4.0|I liked the movie and I enjoy the music, but som songs were better recorded in the seasons.  This was the only place I could buy the song, \\"This Is It.\\"
B001F6TXME|5.0|Bought this to use with my D90.  There are few options to take a shot without pressing the shutter button of your camera: -<br /><br />i.)  Use the timer in your camera<br />ii.) Use a wireless remote device<br />iii.)Use a wired remote device<br /><br />The main reason of avoiding pressing the shutter button of your camera is to reduce/prevent camera shake/vibration.<br /><br />Of the three options above, let me break it down to why this wired remote is the best of them all: -<br /><br />1.) It is much more reliable than a wireless remoted.  I have a wireless one but if the angle is not right, you can't also get the trigger.  The wireless requires battery to function and sometime, the battery is drained when you needed it the most.  The power source of this device is from your camera.<br />2.) It is compact and light.  It will fit nicely in a pocket of your camera bag or your clothing.<br />3.) It is very easy to use.  The connector goes to a specific slot in the D90. Basically, \\"plug and play\\".<br />4.) It is very versatile.  If you press the button once, you got a single shot; if you hold it down, you can get a burst.<br />5.) It has a \\"lock\\" feature that allows you to use the bulb setting in your camera for exposure longer than 30 seconds.  Otherwise, you could equally use the timer in your camera to reduce camera shake.<br />6.) It is reasonably priced and doesn't cause you an arm and a leg.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|I saw IB in theatrical release twice and have ordered my Blu Ray with great pricing at Amazon.com    It will be great to see the Special Edition with the deleted scenes and directorial commentary.

B000MQC9H4|5.0|this is one of the most wonderful movies I've ever watched. over and over. It's touching, funny, exciting, wonderful in everyway. It's a great love story. Well worth your time.
0788749382|5.0|I like unabridged audio version of this book because I need to hear the entire story as Harper Lee wrote it. This version is done wonderfully by Roses Prichard who has the perfect voice and inflection to give each character life and distinctness. Her pacing and soft, subtle voice fit exactly the time and setting of the story. It made me want to take time to listen.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Let me give this a million stars. My daughter adores this movie. The director researched silent film methodology to develop this film because 90% of the dialogue consists of two robots saying each other's name with varying degrees of reflection. It's a \\"quiet\\" movie with wonderful music. It's the least obnoxious sounding child-friendly movie I can think of. I must confess I didn't appreciate it the first time I saw it but now I'm impressed with the attention to detail....it's also a sweet story.
0307266303|1.0|Ok, I'm not a runner, and I hate any kind of shoe or sock that wants to wedge itself between my toes. But I love a good story. I am fascinated by body mechanics. And read all kinds of travel writing, sports memoirs and popular science. I really wanted to like this book. But I just couldn't stick with it. I'd read a bit and had to put it down.     I kept waiting for the runner's equivalent of \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\". But this was just too rambling. Too much 'what I did on my summer vacation'. I stopped being interested fairly quickly. Like \\"Zen and Art of Motorcycle Repair\\", I just don't get what all the fuss is about.     Maybe I just don't belong to the Vibram Five Fingers fan club.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|If the thng that was stopping you from watching Star Trek was the 40 plus years of continuity that made even the simplist of stories confusing, then this movie is for you. Looking better than any science fiction movie to date, this movie starts over at square one without destroying everything that came before. With incredible preformances by everyone involved, this movie is for anyone who enjoys a good adventure movie.
B000002MFE|4.0|The disc arrived quickly in good condition.  The case is ok except the center fingers are broken off on half of them so it doesn't hold the disc securely.  But it works good enough. Music plays fine.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|This is a great dvd - worth  every penny. The pictures are clear and MJ is awesome. However, I wish it was all Michael and less of the crowd - mostly because I love him so much and couldn't care less about the crowd. Also, wasn't a fan of Wanna be Starting Something\\" because it sounded off-key. Regardless, definately worth the buy. 100%. I have bought 3 copies so far, 2 as x-mas gifts.

1592402690|2.0|This is an OK account -  -  Emerick and co-writer do an adequate job of describing the recording process in which the Beatles put together their musical masterpieces.  But I dislike the author's snotty tone in relating his personal experiences with the Beatles. Emerick spends way too much time beating us over our heads pschoanalysing the Beatles - -  Ringo in particular seems to be presented as uneducated and dumb (maybe this is true of Emerick, too). Clearly he has an axe to grind against George, and seems to have taken sides with regards to Lennon vs. McCartney. I don't really care about that childish stuff, there's nothing new here on that (has been written about before extensively in other gossipy books on the Beatles). I don't think knowledgeable readers care either. Emerick's book overall is a waste and a disappointment.    But I guess the editors thought the book was too short, without any \\"gossip\\" -  -  or worse, wouldn't sell.  Anyway, I'd avoid and instead read Macdonald's \\"Revolution in the Head\\" and Schaffner's \\"Beatles Forever\\" -  -  they're both classic descriptions on the power and beauty of the Beatles songs/music.
B002L3RVCY|4.0|The Star Wars Clone Wars series is a great way to expand the Star Wars universe.I always liked Star Wars,but was not a great fan of the new trilogy. In this animated form,you see more of the Star Wars universe,and although some storylines and characters are kind of silly,it really entertains. It's  a great value to the Star Wars universe,and i like to see some more!!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Wonderful story line, graphics and colors make this movie top my list.  It draws you in emotionally from the beginning and reminds us of life lessons we seem to have to learn over and over.  A great movie for EVERYONE, I'm hoping there's an UP TWO!

B002HWRYJE|4.0|I am not a hardcore Trekkie. I used to be, back in the day. I've seen every episode of the original series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager and tolerated most every episode of Enterprise before I lost interest. I own a few of the DVDs, including all the good movies, and I do watch them from time-to-time. But I'm not obessed, like I used to be. I no longer own any of the novels, for example, and can't remember the last time I attended a Trek-specific convention.    But I do still enjoy the show. Like I said, I have some of the episodes on DVD as well as the good movies, and I have a few episodes downloaded onto my 360. I mention all of this so that you know where I am coming from in my review of this, the 11th film in the series. Sort of.    For all the continuity whores out there, let's get this out of the way now: this is not the same universe as the regular Trek reality. It's made very clear about halfway into the film that since the opening credits we've been in an alternate reality. If you, like me, start wondering why the Farragut is launching without Kirk on board, don't worry; it just happened differently in this reality. Same with certain larger events that clearly never happened in the continuity that we're used to. If you're a hardcore fan of the series, keep this in mind and you'll be ok.    For the rest of you, yeah, you'll have a good time, I think. There's plenty of action and a feeling quite different from any of the other movies or TV shows in the series. The acting by everyone is top-notch, particlarly Zachary (Spock) Quinto and Karl (McCoy) Urban. The plot is at times a little iffy (centering around this movies Khan wanna-be as he sets out for revenge against Spock), but that's ok. It accomplishes what it set out to do, and that's good enough.    This is a far from perfect movie. It features way too much action and not nearly enough of the emotional and scientific core that made Trek such a great program. The villain isn't much ofmuch, and most of the lower-tier characters don't really have a lot to do. There's also a very unnecessary romance between a couple of the characters that I did not care for.    But that said, there's a lot in this movie to enjoy. Rather like Doctor Who and Battlestar Galactica, they've kept a lot of what works and, if nothing else it does do a great job of getting all the pieces on the board for the next film in the series, meaning that the franchise shall, once again, live long and... oh, I just can't bring myself to type that. Just enjoy the movie.
B000F1IQN2|2.0|......For Dullest Actor on the Planet. He leads a cast of no-name nobodies in this immensely unbelievable movie. If you can watch past the ridiculous shootout at an hour and 16 minutes, give yourself a pat on the back. With so many liberties taken with history, it's ashame this travesty was even made. Dialogue rarely rings true, and characters never seem to develop any sort of rapport or even a hint of a personality. A tragedy that should've translated into a riveting movie just bored me to tears, and my eyes rolled back into my skull so many times I am permanently cross-eyed. Good shots of cities around the globe, and for capturing the look and feel of the early 70's, cudos. Otherwise, a shameful mess.

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|\\"Up\\" was definitely one of my favorite movies this year!!!!!!  Not that I do not love all of the Pixar movies, but this was one that adults could enjoy in a way that children may not the first time they see it. It has the potential to teach all of us that there are more important things in life than the house you live in, and that you miss a lot in the here and now when you spend the rest of your life dwelling on memories.  A very well-done movie, fun for everyone to watch!
0316010669|5.0|This book is a great read! Gladwell has a great gift for being able to tie things together and come up with general principles that make sense based on the evidence. The examples given in the book are great. Some of the conclusions are counter-intuitive to begin with, but make a lot of sense once you have had some time to think about them. A great book with good lessons.
B001MW0IY8|4.0|The first time I heard Antony's music, I really didn't know if I liked it that much. I thought that it sounded a little...well, odd.<br /><br />My friend bought this cd for me and said that I would really love him because I enjoy Rufus Wainwright (both artists have sung \\"Old Whore's Diet\\" on one of Rufus's albums). So I took a listen and immediately didn't care too much about it.<br /><br />One night this fall my iPod was skipping around with music and three of Antony's songs came on, one right after the other...I was hooked. I ended up loving him and I even bought a few other of his cds.<br /><br />If at first you don't know what to think about it, listen to it at least three times over, I guarantee you will like at least two songs.
B00004R99F|5.0|I watched this movie as a child, and now I enjoy watching this movie with my son! All around great movie. You won't be dissappointed! In fact, I bought this DVD to replace the DVD my son broke. I just couldn't stand the thought of not having it!
B000UJ48XG|4.0|I picked this CD up randomly at a Cheapo store this summer and when I popped it into my CD player I didn't take it out for a month.<br /><br />This is beautifully haunting music.

B00005R24K|5.0|\\"The Evil Dead\\" was originally turned down by all the major Hollywood movie studios due to its graphic depiction of evil and gore, but a European studio finally released the film after it was previewed at the Cannes Film Festival. Budgeted at around $300,000, the film would become a modest hit at the boxoffice and ultimately garner a cult following after it was released on home video and DVD. The story deals with five college students who embark themselves on a deserted cabin in Tennessee. When they find an audio recording that releases evil spirits all hell breaks loose. Don't watch this if you have a weakness for scary films as \\"The Evil Dead\\" is probably the most gruesome horror flick I have ever witnessed, even more so than \\"The Exorcist\\". Running at just under 90 minutes, the DVD comes with audio commentary by its director/writer Sam Raimi and producer Robert Topert, behind the scenes footage and outtakes, trailer, TV spots, and more. There is an informative booklet that accompanies the disc as well. When the film was released on DVD by Anchor Bay the movie was fully restored with renewed video and audio quality. Turn the lights out, grab the popcorn, and watch this little gem. Trust me; you will be scared!
B000025RHI|2.0|it beats me what all the fuss is about. i own a lot of lee perry, upsetters etc, and i love them all, but this one leaves me cold.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|The mother Lisa has the most poignant line in \\"Ponyo,\\" saying the equivalent of \\"When you find yourself surrounded by magic and wonder, you don't try and understand it you just enjoy it.\\"<br /><br />To me, that is the theme and lesson of \\"Ponyo\\" (\\"Gake no Ue no Ponyou\\" or \\"Ponyo on the Cliffs\\"). After dabbling in darker themes and more adult-orientated fare like [[ASIN:B00003CXBK Princess Mononoke]] and [[ASIN:B00005JLEU Spirited Away]], Miyazaki has returned to the lighter, simpler themes of the magic and mystery of childhood as found in his groundbreaking [[ASIN:B00003CXCZ My Neighbor Totoro]]. One can always tell the target audience for a Miyazaki film by the age of the main character: \\"Spirited Away\\" was made for 10-year olds, \\"Princess Mononoke\\" was made for teenagers. The lead characters in \\"Ponyo\\" are 5 years old.<br /><br />Like \\"My Neighbor Totoro,\\" \\"Ponyo\\" is a film based on a childlike sense of joy and imagination. There is no need for a \\"villain\\" or some arbitrary conflict or threat for the children to overcome. Like Satsuki and Mei, Sosuke and Ponyo are pure at heart, and open to exploring the wonders around them. They feel their emotions without cynicism or thought, instead living in the moment and experiencing its joys, sorrows and fears.<br /><br />Which is not to say there is no depth here. In \\"Ponyo,\\" Miyazaki has blended two unlikely sources; Richard Wagner's pounding opera [[ASIN:B00092ZAOA Wagner - Die Walkure]] from [[ASIN:B000QFBW6K Der Ring Des Nibelungen]] and Hans Christian Anderson's melancholy fairy tale [[ASIN:0786803835 The Little Mermaid]]. The essential set-up comes from \\"Die Walkure,\\" where the god Wotan holds the goddess Freia captive, and is also the possessor of the Rhinegold Ring which grants vast magical powers so long as one gives up all possibility of love. As a nod to this, the name Ponyo is giving by her father is Br&uuml;nnhilde, one of the Valkyrie who feels the power of the Ring and must make the choice between love and paradise. This story is skillfully blended with Anderson's \\"Little Mermaid,\\" about a sea creature who must win the love of a human or be reduced to soulless sea foam.<br /><br />Miyazaki essentially presents two movies. The front film is basic, colorful and easy to understand for children. The animation in \\"Ponyo\\" is some of the best that I have ever seen, with Miyazaki personally drawing much of the underwater and ocean scenes, utilizing the influence of classic Japanese ukiyo-e pictures. Miyazaki has said that \\"Ponyo\\" is his most technically complicated film, using more unique images than any previous film.<br /><br />The second, deeper story is something that can only be assembled from fragments and snatches of conversation. For example, the wizard Fujimoto, Ponyo's father, was a human being who fell in love with the ocean goddess Gran Mammare, and struggled for centuries to burn away his humanity and become consort and protector for the entity he loved. More than anyone, he understands the sacrifices and struggles awaiting Ponyo when she loves someone not of her world. These story/sub-story elements are one of the things I love so much about Japanese film, where more expectations are put on the audience to read between the lines and to give thought to the unspoken as well as the spoken<br /><br />I am not sure how much of this deeper story survived the translation into English, as I watched the film in Japanese. There are some nuances that probably went missing, and I am curious as to how some of the scenes were handled, such as when Lisa sings Sosuke a part of the theme song to \\"My Neighbor Totoro\\" to cheer him up when his father is not home. Some other things, such as the significance of tunnels in Japanese folklore (considered the realm of female Mountain Gods who are prone to jealousy, it is assumed that the tunnel would not take kindly to a water deity passing through. However, outside the tunnel is a statue of Jizo, the protector of children, which sends avisual clue to the audience that Sosuke and Ponyo are going to be alright.) also might pass unnoticed or appear confusing to Western audiences, although every Japanese person would inately understand this without needing to be told.<br /><br />Miyazaki proved in \\"Ponyo\\" that he is still the greatest director of animated films alive. I am so thrilled to have seen this movie, and I know I will watch it again and again.e going to be alright.) also might pass unnoticed or appear confusing to Western audiences, although every Japanese person would inately understand this without needing to be told.

B002QH2NUA|1.0|I'm a huge Beatles fan and I can consume and enjoy any amount of Beatles solo releases, but like some other reviewers here, I found the use of auto-tune on Paul's vocals in this to be incredibly distracting and disturbing. Many reviewers don't seem bothered by it, but for me, it makes the album very hard to listen to. I honestly can't imagine I'll be playing this again very often, which is a great shame because other than the auto-tuning, it's fabulous. Of all the people to use auto-tuning, why on earth would Paul do it, given that he is clearly one of the all-time great singers. I don't think I've ever heard him sing out of tune. It's pointless, and leaves a very bad taste in the mouth.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|First off this is actually the first Star Trek Move i have seen all the way threw. I was a fan of Star Trek:The Next Generation and Voyager. The First time I saw Star Trek was in Iraq when i was over seas for about a year. Though the move was free, I wouldn't mind if I had to pay to see it. The action is great as well as the acting. This film showed no sign of slowing down, and when it was over I wanted more. At a little over 2hr my only flaw with the film is that it was to short. Like the lord of the rings films, I never felt like this film was dragging. All the guys that gave this film a bad review are(to my opinion)nitpicking. Most are hating on some plot holes that are explained in the prequel comic book.  This is by far the best film I've seen since The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, now all that is left is to wait for the sequel.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|If you enjoy Star Trek and have a blu-ray player , you'll enjoy this title with all the extra features plus the movie is terrific on an HDTV.

B002VECMAY|3.0|George Clooney plays the suave role here reminiscent (a bit) of his part in Michael Clayton. He looks more and more like Clark Gable in each movie.<br />His character Ryan travels from city to city, a glib corporate axe-man, signing on to fire staff at various companies when the in-house booses lack the guts to fire staff themselves. He prides himself on his coldness, his lack of attachments, no house, no wife, no friends nothing but a zillion American Airlines sky miles. He \\"up in the air\\" in the cold and clouds. He shows up, tells people they are fired, repeating the same routine about how this is their big chance to do what they always wanted, etc, etc. He meets a woman, Alex played by Vera Farmiga, who also lives in the air, more or less. \\"Think of me as just like you, but with a v[female parts]\\", she says.<br /><br />The \\"fire-ees\\"? \\"terminateds\\"? in this movie are NOT actors, the director went for real people who had recently been fired and acted them to say, in their words, what then said when they were really axed. They lend gravitas. Clooney works for a company that specializes in this. The company decide to hire a new young woman, played by Anna Kendrick, who want to cut expenses (there is a Recession, after all...) by axing employees over the internet instead of in person.<br /><br />The movie is very slick, very well acted and directed. Very believeable. Very soulless.<br /><br />By the things change (I won't reveal the plot) and we are supposed to feel sorry for Clooney at the end, but it didn't work that way with me. It is supposed to be ironic and funny in places. It is funny in places, but I just felt really, really sad and sorry for all those people getting fired whose lives were being destroyed...
B000YDOOUK|4.0|Airboourne's debut album is straight out of the AC / DC school of classic rock n roll.  The music is straight forward good time heavy rock that borders on metal.  These guys tear it up and sound like they are having a great time doing it.  The lyrics are all macho party rock, and the guitar solos straight and to the point, but these guys do what they do very well.  This is a great one to crank up on your car stereo.  If you like old school heavy party rock n roll that sound very similar to AC / DC you should really check these guys out.
0440237688|5.0|Everybody should read The Giver because you never get bored.  There is lots of action and feelings that Jonas has.  You get really attached to Jonas so you want to read more and more.  Lois Lowry is such a good writer.  This fantastic book is about an eleven year old boy who hasn't gone through any pain, loss of family, or even heard about war.  The weather is controlled, the food is provided for them, and they have to take pills every day.  No one knows what they are for in the community, but they don't care.  That's because the pills control their feelings.  The people don't care about anything.  Love or want to make a change in the community is ignored.  Until the main character, Jonas, turns twelve, he doesn't realize what he needed to do.     When anybody in the community turns twelve, they receive a job.  Their job is chosen for them. Jonas gets picked as a Receiver.  The Receiver gets all the memory from the past (our time).  When he learns about all he is missing out, he takes action.  Trying to find a way out of sameness, Jonas learns sneaking out of the community isn't such a good idea.

B002R0F3Q2|5.0|'The Element of Freedom' is Alicia Keys' fourth studio album, fifth overall; and I must say that she definetly pushed herself off her limits but not as far as I believe she is capable of. Nonetheless, 'Freedom' is a great collection of songs that really understand what the listener is feeling which is what Alicia aims to do with her songs. She doesn't go for that #1 hit, she writes because she's a writer, an artist. So I'll review the album by song:    1: Element of Freedom [Intro] - I am so glad that she used this quote to open the album because it definetly explains what the album will be about. However, I do miss her signature introduction on her last albums that include her playing the piano, sampling harmonies like Beethoven and Chopin. Grade: A+    2: Love Is Blind - Alicia sings in a different way in this song and at first, I was unsure of what to make about it, but the more I listen, the more I like it. She steps out of her comfort zone, and really delivers on this song. The message is heavy and is complimented by the instrumentals. Grade: A-    3: Doesn't Mean Anything - This was the first single off the album and even though it flopped on the charts, it's a very nice song with a powerful message. It's too bad this song is underrated thanks to the trash on the radio people call music. It's very simple yet strong, like her 2007 hit, \\"No One\\". Grade: B+    4: Try Sleeping With A Broken Heart - This song must be the best song on the album. Everything from the lyrics, to her voice, to the music tied in very well and the mood is so strong. Some say this song should've been the first single, I don't know if I would agree cause I liked 'Doesn't Mean Anything'. Grade: A+    5: Wait Til You See My Smile - Slow, simple song with beautiful lyrics. I could definetly see this song in a movie somehow. Grade: B    6: That's How Strong My Love Is - The piano in this song is what makes me fall for this song. It's one of the songs that relate to the listener and the lyrics of this song are phenominal! Wonderfully arranged. Grade: A    7: Un-Thinkable [I'm Ready] - Drake co-wrote this song with Alicia and it's the best duet of the album. This song has single potential and I believe it will do good on the charts. Grade: B+    8: Love Is My Disease - This song doesn't catch my attention just yet, but soon enough it will. The way it's arraged throws me of a bit, but nonetheless it's not an album-filler, that;s for sure. Grade: B    9: Like The Sea - Love seems to be the theme of the album rather than freedom, but in spite of the album's title, this song expresing love is a finger-snapping, head-bopping song. Wonderful. Grade: A-    10: Put It In A Love Song [ft. Beyonce] - I like the mini-intorduction Alicia has with Beyonce, before the song break down the convo and the dance groove begins. This song sort of feels like none of the rest of the songs in this album, however its a good effort for Keys' to get her Beyonce on. Grade: A    11: This Bed - This song is on constant replay on my iPod, I like how it expresses her emotions of her loneliness and lost love. Grade: A-    12: Distance and Time: This song is the second-best song on the album after the fourth track, listeners can definetly relate to this song, especially if he/she is in a long distance relationship. Grade: A+    13: How It Feels To Fly: Probably the only song that has that element of freedom in its lyrics, but it does set you in the mood in wonder and desire to fly, which is a feeling everyone can relate to. Grade: B    14: Empire State of Mind Part 2 - This version of the hit single must be a classic, it should be NYC'c city anthem. She sounds great as usual and is the perfect way to close the album.    Overall, the album is awesome. A must have of the year. It could make a great christmas present for the one you love. Great job Alicia!
0321544080|4.0|The moment it clicks: Photography secrets from one of the world's top shooters<br />Joe McNally<br /><br />Joe McNally's work is world-renowned and many of the photos in this book will familiar to its readers. He's worked in over 50 countries and has the portfolio and talent to highlight it in roughly 225 pages.<br /><br />The book itself is broken down into four main chapters and includes a handy lighting tips, gear (wow, what an investment!) and glossary guide at the end. As well, the Barroom chapter provides amusing anecdotes that those in the photography world can relate to. Joe's a great storyteller which leads me into the negative factor of the book: it's entertaining but won't cover the nitty gritty of getting the shots shown. The photographer assumes that his readers know a lot about photography and his tips, while educational and relevant, leave a lot of details out. I think that the tip is there more to inspire and motivate rather than try and emulate. Part coffee table, part instructional reference book, I would recommend purchasing this book for either its aesthetic, story-telling quality, or for an advanced photographer that will certainly know where to pick up from where the tip leaves off.<br /><br />To recap: a gorgeous book and well worth having on the shelf for those excellent tips and stories!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|2-3 a month my parents come over and play board games with my wife and I.  This year we just decided to all go together and buy a new game instead of exchanging Xmas presents.  I chose Settlers of Catan after playing it on the internet several times.  Since no one else came up with a suggestion, Settlers won by default.  We opened it the other night (so its not Christmas yet, I can live with it if you can).  Let's just say it won over a 50, 61, and a 75 year old.  My wife is even talking about sending one to my sister's family for Christmas.    I did have some issues with the board hexes not fitting within the border properly.  I'm going to try trimming up some of the edges (removing the tabs from where attached to the shipping boards) and see if that goes better.  As for overall durability, its not the toughest material but if you don't use the pieces as frisbees they will last for many years.  Its a board game, they are meant to be laid flat on a solid surface.
031606792X|1.0|Edit: Changed some bits and added some sentences to make it more understandable to what I'm saying.    I finally decided to post my review of this saga, which wasn't a joyous ride on a unicorn.  But I did read it to see how bad it was.  Call it a sick trait of mine since curiosity poked and prodded me endlessly like a child and I gave in.  I guess I like to torture myself with the horrible writing that SMeyer gives.    Which is straight to what I'm going to talk about first.      The writing is horrible and not in just this book.  I've read Shakespeare's works as well as the Time Machine, which was may more complicated to comprehend than this, yet I could understand them more than most of those in the classroom.  Does it mean I'm far intelligent?  No.  What I'm saying is that I'd prefer to read those books while locked up instead of these four so called \\"vampire/romance\\" novels.    What makes these books horrible in writing is that SMeyer doesn't use conjunctions at all and RARELY uses a blasted period or semicolon.  She also likes to uses phrases or adjectives that are placed in odd places or that isn't even heard anymore.    I mean, really? His body like a diamond statue?  Screw the ring, let's just make him small size and take him everywhere.  Or, better yet, make him into a ring and go around and say, \\"Does my husband dazzle you?\\"      Now, enough of that silly nonsense and let's go to the points of settings/events of this book.  I'm sure you've seen these by other reviewers.    First thing we're thrown in is Bella whining of her wanting to have sex with Eddysparklepants.  A vampire who sparkles.  A walking diamond, trust me, the nicknames for ol' Eddykins goes on.      She's in High School wanting to have sex with this guy but he goes \\"No, we need to get married to do so.\\"  Did anyone else did a \\"Wtf?\\" since I sure as hell did.  \\"Oh no, we can't since we're not married but sure, we can have sex afterwards even though we're both virgins.\\"  Yeah, okay SMeyer.  That makes PERFECT sense.    Not.    So, the wedding goes and she isn't pleased.  Oh, and screw the details since it was all amazing.  Wow, everything was so amazing for our dear Gary Stu and his now wife, Mary Sue - oh wait.  I mean Edward \\"Fairy\\" Cullen and Bella \\"Whining\\" Swan to enjoy or, thanks to our lovely bride (writer too) to describe what it all looked like.  Instead, we're led to believe that because it was OH SO AMAZING, we couldn't even imagine it ourselves.      (By the way when I use ALL CAPS, it's to use emphasis.)    Now Bella goes \\"Forget college since I'm smart enough to get a job\\".  Okay, not really but it's the vibe that I was getting.  Yeah, good job going with that Bella.  Oh wait, you probably could since, duh, you're the most awesome, uber-special, main character.  How could I forget the rules of Mary-Sueism?  Oh for shame on me!    So then they have sex.  Rough sex too!  Oh yes, bite the pillow, bang the headboard like there's no tomorrow!  Bruise her, bruise her good!  Oh, was I getting too carried away?  Sorry, you see, I was glad he did this to poor ol' Bella in HOPES she would leave him after seeing just how ~*~SCARY~*~ he is.  But, uh, nope.  Didn't happen.      There goes my dream down the drain and into the lake near my house.  Woe is me.     In truth, I like reading rough sex, but I've never seen that sort of things happen with a pillow nor the headboard.  I've read a lot of novels with dragons, vampires, and demons, and most of them were badasses who slaughtered millions.  Now, I can understand the bruising since, duh, he's a vampire.  He's not a human, he's a vampire with bloodlust and a \\"monster\\" who can easily rip your head off.  I'm expecting no nice and sweet stuff at all.    But then!  Oh wow, something happens!  Something that SHOULDN'T even happen.  How?  Why, Mrs. Average-yet-Beautiful and Mr. Diamond Man are gonna be parents!  Oh sweet joy to my ears!    Not.    Okay, it has been said that \\"Nope, can't make babies.  Next!\\"but, well, lookie here!  We have it.  Sure SMeyer, sure.  You keep doing that and you'll be making HUGE bucks.  Nasty bucks with twisted antlers.    Then it's time for the birth.  Wooo, yay.  Wait.  Now the baby is acting like an alien-demon-whatever sort of thing and is starting to kill her.  Oh, whatever shall they do?  Eddykins says to abort it but no!  It must come out despite causing her to die!    Excuse me while I go laugh endlessly more than a hyena in the Lion King.    I'm not laughing because it's funny, I'm laughing because of the plain stupidity of the explanations saying another and then this comes out like a total \\"OH I CHANGED MY MIND\\".  Lulz forever on end.    So now we have Mr. Fairy gnawing away Bella's skin to let the baby out.  Blood is everywhere by the way, which I don't care for since it's in writing, but, seriously?  A vampire doing this type of thing?  Wouldn't he, you know, wanted to drink the blood?    Now THAT would be fun to read!    So they save the child, yada, yada.  Who flipping cares?  I sure don't.  Oh, I forgot to mention that since Bella is going through faint land with butterflies and sparkles, we're thrown into Jacob's mind.  Yeah, okay, you do that SMeyer.  I'll go watch Who's Line instead.    Then they name the child.  I forgot how to spell it but I would sure as heck change that name when I grow older.  Now, I did laugh at her nickname given by Jacob.  That is, until he imprinted the poor child.  Great move SMeyer, once again!  Oh man, you sure know what you're doing.  Yeah, take that smile off your face.  You aren't fooling anyone with this.    Oh, I forgot one detail that went through that and that is Bella becoming a vampire!  Oh wow, totally didn't see that coming!  Oh, oh, she's gonna go through that TERRIBLE and HORRIBLE transformation, right?  Finally, something is getting heated up in this kitchen- oh wait.  False alarm guys.  It was just a drill.  See?  Nothing going on.    In other words, Bella went through the transformation like nothing.  Nada.  We were told how awful and how someone would go \\"RAWR NEED BLOOD KILL KILL\\" but what do we get?  Nothing but a perfect vampire with her perfect baby.  Yay.    Of course, that isn't it!  There's more!    So, here I am going, \\"Oh finally, let's see some action with these wise vampires!  Let someone DIE for once.\\"  They come, check.  They try to do their stuff but wait, what's this?!  Holy Batman!  It's, it's, it's NOT Superman!  It's NOT a bird and it sure as heck isn't a plane!    Could it be?!  Why yes!    LOVE SHIELD! -insert corny music from the 70's-  BEEEELLLA SWAAAAN!  \\"I'm perfect, but not YOU~ ;D -high pitched cute giggle-\\"    But do these other vampires fight back?!  Heaven's no!  They're much more afraid than THIS blasphemy shield of DOOM that they talk and then retreat.    The WISE vampires are afraid from a NEWBORN vampire.    My brain is going, \\"Logic cannot be found.  Please hang up and try again.\\"  Sure, it's a fantasy.  Sure, it's a easy read, but, come ON, that was the worst ending (and story) I've ever read.  I've read Sherrilyn Kenyon's ending that kicked more butt with this with someone DYING and then coming back because they DESERVED it because they sacrificed something.    But with Twilight?  Ha, screw that!  Everyone gets what they wanted without doing anything to deserve it!  Happy Early Holidays!  Be happy, perfect, and overall awesome.  In other words, SMeyer went like this, \\"Okay, you guys want an ending?  There.  Have it.\\"  A huge slap in the face for anyone who is reading this book that was expecting something GOOD but they found a crappy ending instead.    So, what did I think overall?  I think SMeyer shouldn't have published this and shouldn't have sent it to thirty publishers to have it published.  I also think that whoever gets on ME about not LIKING this book, or anyone for that matter, just because we don't understand \\"TWU WUV\\" or the whole point needs to stop and use their brain and realize that this is not even the slightest bit of true love.  No way, no how.    These books are GREAT examples to show what love ISN'T.  I love my boyfriend for WHO he is, not how he looks.  I don't expect him to be ANYONE else but himself.  He loves me for the same reason and Bella and Edward do NOT have this relationship.  You can cry, moan, whatever you please, but it still won't change the fact that they do NOT love each other.    Their relationship is based on looks and, being as sues themselves, are attracted to each other.  Lust if you will, which is very different than loving someone.    If he actually loved her, he wouldn't offer Jacob to create some babies with her.  That is just WRONG.  Wrong on so many levels.  It's also wrong to cut someone's car wires.  Yeah, you see, if my boyfriend did that, I would be pissed as hell and not love him anymore.  It's not his property and he doesn't own my life.    If she actually loved him, she wouldn't be jumping off cliffs (that's over dramatic by a thousand) since she should understand that being a vampire doesn't come with pretty ponies.  She also wouldn't be so snobby to him as well as being selfish.  I mean, seriously, getting MAD at your wedding?  I would be smiling a lot.      So with Edwards \\"I shall rule your life\\" and Bella's \\"I'm selfish enough to be mad at you because we have to be married to have sex\\" is not love.  Don't care what you say, that right there is NOT what love is.  Young adult novel or not, that is the most bogus love story idea.    So next time you go looking for a romance novel with badass vampires, don't pick this series up.  It's more of what a teen would write for her wet sexual fantasies.  Oh wait-.
B000002J5K|5.0|I had this on cassette tape when it came out.  I was (at the time) disappointed (I was 14) that some songs were omitted and just thought the soundtrack was ok.  I am a Blues Brothers nut!  I bought this again on CD just to have it in the collection and for days \\"She Caught the Katy\\" was running through my head! When I got it, I listen to it several times all the way through.  This is a classic album and a great soundtrack. The Blues Brothers will always remain one of my favorite bands. The music they performed seems timeless and you can sense the fun they had doing these songs!
0767802470|3.0|I loved the theatrical release of this film when it was new in about 1985. I watched it on VHS.     Now I wanted to update to DVD and didn't really look too closely at the different versions that were available. I figured, \\"Director's Cut\\" new scenes added, ten bucks, that's for me.     Well, they did add new scenes but they also took out scenes, too. Why? And why did they sanitize it? In several scenes they took out an innocent natural swear word, and they cut almost entirely the crew's expression of their real wishes when they think they are returning to La Rochelle.     In addition the film was shot twice, I think, when it was made -- once in German and once in English. That is I do not remember the film being overdubbed. Here it is in German with overdubbed English and the dubbing is not so good.     I am searching now for the proper version, sheesh.
B0029LHW68|3.0|30 Seconds To Mars defeated all odds with there last album, signifying they weren't going to be short circuited with sophomore slump. \\"This is War\\" is there third and newest album, the group begins to move away from the spacey theatrics of the previous two releases. Many tracks still feature the airy reverberations, and electronic resonance, but project them differently.<br /><br />The album displays its singles quite openly, and I hate to say it but a handful of the other tracks feel like filler. Not saying the songs are bad, but for once there album may play out better not listening to all the tracks at once. There are very similar transitions and techniques in the songs that make a majority of them similar. To try and break this up some acoustic tracks have been laid into the mix.<br /><br />My pick off the album is the track \\"Hurricane\\" featuring Kanye West (once again he uses his vocoder). The song leans toward the longer side, but still remains attentive enough to make for a good listen. Few things set this album apart, one would be the chorus in \\"Vox Populi\\". The songs don't have the melodic flairs the past two albums had. Fast forwarding to the half way mark on nearly all tracks brings you to the same release.<br /><br />I was originally going to give this album a two star rating, but a few tracks were strong enough to save it. \\"Stranger In a Strange Land\\" being one of the really notable tracks, partially electro instrumental with some cool synth effects (reminds me of the reason why I liked this band in the first place).  \\"L490\\" with its intro alarm, to the glistening acoustic, the the heated ending of the dark mantra, another good pretty much instrumental track. If there is a notable trend here it would be that the instrumental tracks have the extra oomph needed to keep this album from going stale.<br /><br />30 Seconds to Mars didn't strike gold again, but they did make a decent artsy album. They had some great ideas both musically and lyrically, the presentation just didn't encourage it. Either way still not enough to turn me away from the group, and hopefully there next album will come back with full force.it.

When two weeks passed, and I didn't receive the CD, I contacted the Seller and they \\"researched\\" it.  Another week later, the Seller offered to ship it, and I was told I'd have it Thanksgiving weekend, and they would refund the shipping charges.  Not only did the CD arrive the week after Thanksgiving, but Seller never refunded the shipping.  I would NEVER order from them again.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I don't quite understand the negative reviews. Its not perfect, but it does really good job with the essence of the story given the time restraint. To do the story in the book requires more time (see BBC 6 episode version...which is also good). Creating a movie from this book requires some interpretation as we don't really get into Darcy's head. Plus the book often has narrative and not dialogue at key points, requiring screen writers to fill in what the characters would have said. Its interesting to see how the different movie versions (there was an old one with Lawrence Oliver, an 80's version, the BBC Colin Firth version and this one) deal with those narrative sections that needed dialogue.  I can see the complaint about Keira's portrayal being tomboyish, but I found it refreshing compared to other portrayals. Her Elizabeth did seem more frank and forward with her opinion (character traits of Elizabeth). In other versions the actresses said Elizabeth's words, but they didn't really exuded the essence of Elizabeth. I also thought the Bennett home and attire better showed the class distinction between the Bennetts and Darcy than other movie versions. The class distinction as well as the Bennett family's behavior are why Darcy initially objects to Elizabeth. I do love Colin Firth's Darcy, but I thought Matthew did a great job as well. I love the end when he walks across the field and stutters his feelings (which is different from the book, but I love it anyway). My impression of Darcy from the book was that aside from his station (which would make him proud) he was also shy. There are several passages in the book in which he talks about not feeling socially adept. I thought Matthew showed that part of Darcy well. I do wish it was more like the book (especially at Pemberly) but that would have been a longer film. If you don't know the book, I could see how it would be hard to see how these two could fall in love based on the interaction seen in the movie. More focus to Darcy/Elizabeth scenes from the book would have helped. I did like the last scene (in US version) a great deal and wished Austin had ended with a scene between Darcy and Elizabeth at Pemberly.to Darcy/Elizabeth scenes from the book would have helped.

B002HWRZH0|3.0|I like the movie, and have seen it a few times already.  The Enterprise replica is all metal as described.  The ship is a bit small, but well detailed on the chrome stand.  However, as said by others, the packaging and certificate is a bit cheesy.  Nothing special about the box to keep or even display the Enterprise, and the certificate isn't numbered, so there can be more than 5000 sets out there.      I'd rate it another star if the packaging was better, the ship was bigger, or the price was lower.  So the question is: would you spend another $70+ for a metal Enterprise replica??
B002T9H2LK|5.0|Quinten Tarantino has a love hate relationship with the movie going public. He is one of the few major faces in film who wants to make movies his way whether you love them or hate them. His stories are jumbled his humor is crude and to a great deal of dislike he loves to push the bar. In the end he manages to put together a brilliant ensemble cast and always finds ways to take some of the famous names in acting and put them in a role and is out of their element. The outcome just gives fan goose bumps especially with the newest edition to his library.<br /><br />Inglorious Basterds was a movie I was very eager to see. As a Tarantino fan and lover of every film he has directed I was very excited to see a movie about Jewish soldier beating up Nazis. As a member of the Jewish faith and a grandchild of Holocaust survivors there was no doubt in my mind that this was a film that was going to spark tremendous amounts of controversy. Yes, the story told is entirely false and the major Jewish press felt that his work was a shear mockery, but Tarantino stated he had no intentions of making a Holocaust documentary. As a fan of films that involve larger than life heroics, he wanted to give every little Jewish boy and girl a dose of ...dare I say it...Pulp Fiction. These types of stories go back to the days of Superman and Captain America comic books taking down the Nazis and it was done with style and class and Tarantino in my eyes at least didn't push any harsh buttons with me. The acting in this film is awesome, he cast the right people for the right roles especially Christoph Waltz as Nazi Colonel Hans Landa. His performance was the best I have seen all year and he really put fear into the movie watchers. I am so happy he was nominated for the golden globe and I sure hope he gets the Oscar nod and wins it. Brad Pitt, I have not seen in a more brilliant role since the stoner in `True Romance'. You also have great performances from Diane Kruger, and yes even Mike Myers! As a Tarantino fan, you get everything you need from Inglorious Basterds. Listen very carefully to some of the voices you hear throughout the film you may get a few awesome surprises.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie yet, Jewish or not it is a must see.

B000059MEK|5.0|I started listening to Daft Punk in 2007. My first purchase was their live album released that year, Alive 2007. I thought it would be a good place to start. And honestly, other than a few nice points here and there, I hated it. I certainly could not have enjoyed it not knowing any of their songs! I realize that now, but, at the time it seemed Daft Punk was an overrated, lame dance band.    Then, in 2008, I bought their best of. Just cuz I'd found that, with dance bands, the studio albums are overlong and mucky and filler-ridden. Daft Punk certainly grew on me a bit there. Then I picked up Homework. It seemed like a good album, but it was so damn scratchy and distorted! It hurt my head after a while. But they certainly seemed interesting. Then, I picked up Discovery.    Discovery is one of those albums you come across once every few years and hate yourself for not having picked it up when it came out; Beck's Odelay, the Beastie Boys' Paul's Boutique, and Arcade Fire's Funeral come to mind. But, compared to Discovery, those albums are filler-ridden. This one of a kind album blows my mind with each listening.    What makes it so good is that it highlights every emotion you feel, sometimes without lyrics. When you're feeling wild and want to party, you've got the cheesy disco hit \\"One More Time\\". When you feel head over your heels with a beautiful person you've just met and feel like you're about to burst with butterflies (sounds lame, but oddly, it happens), you've got \\"Digital Love\\". When you go out with that person and you are subsequently dumped, you get the beautiful instrumental \\"Veridis Quo\\", a certain album highlight. And when you feel like an absolute freak and just want to bug out, you have \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\".    Every single song would be a certain album highlight on any other album out now. This is a lovely album that I look forward to bonding with these next few decades.
0140182314|4.0|My girlfriend and I are going to spend about a little over a week in Catalonia. I've been reading several books to get a better understanding of the people of Catalonia. I consider this book 'good'. I've enjoyed many of Orwell's books and this one has added to my growing understanding of the region however I would not look to it as a soul source of information.   It's written in first person (as i'm sure you're aware) and it was very enjoyable easy read.

It eventually found its way to the trash.
0061703257|3.0|Putting my own prejudices aside about how Lehane ends the book, I think that while he had a good premise for the story, the constant moving back in forth from the present to previous dialogues with his wife/others interrupted the flow of the book. I'm sure some people would respond that's what makes the book 'dense' ,but to me it was distracting. I rather have a story in the mode of David Morrell. The ending to me at best is sad and at worst, sucks.<br /><br />TK
0679735909|5.0|This is by far my favourite novel as it incorporated lush imagery, beautiful poetry, romantic storylines, heartbreaking emotions and enough intellectual stimulation as to render it right up there with the classics of literature! I read this first in high school and it moved me deeply (which is rare, I've found, in modern literature). You feel what the characters feel, you yearn for what they yearn for. A.S. Byatt uses an incredibly beautiful vocabulary and uses the meanings of words to their utmost potential. Possession is just an extraordinary literary masterpiece and I recommend it fully.

B001GQ2TGA|4.0|I bought this CD during the 2008 holiday season and I really enjoyed most of the songs on it.  I will say that it's not for everyone, especially if you're not into Enya's style of music.  But overall, it added a very ethereal vibe to my home during the holiday season and everybody   was asking me \\"Who is that?\\" as it played softly in the background, mixed in with other christmas   music which I had playing randomly. That's what I think made it fit in so beautifully!  I didn't just put the whole CD on and play it track for track, but it gave it more effect  spliced in between other more standard Christmas fair like Al Jarreau, Harry Connick Jr.,   Tony Bennett, Rashaan Patterson, and other classic christmas songs from days gone by.  At any rate, I think most would enjoy this CD in their 2009 collection and beyond.  I'll give it a solid A- rating overall! (-:

B002FRNCG0|4.0|I don't like when a rock band 3 albums deep starts to sing about the band itself, which seems to have happened here.  Also, the lyrics don't seem to hold the same weight as the previous albums...as well as the twilight tracks.  \\"Caught\\" and \\"Decode\\" are really great songs, so I was very excited, but sort of let down on this album.  The best lyrics on the entire album happen about 1 minute into it with \\"I had it all but not what I wanted, cause hope for me was a place uncharted and overgrown.\\"      I love Hayley's singing ability through and through.  I watch her live stuff (youtube acoustic sets) and I am in awe and moved.  She's very talented and just happens to have a voice that I love to hear for whatever reason it may be.  Though, on this album, I don't get the same vibrance and inflections found on their other albums, but I can't really explain why I feel that way.  Oddly enough, Rob Cavallo produced it and I really respect his work from back in the earlier Green Day albums.  Like I said...just a little let down, but perhaps my tastes have changed or they've grown in a way I don't totally vibe with.    Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy this album, it's just not going to be something I listen to 3-5 years from now, but the other albums I imagine I will.  If you like Paramore and have not heard caught or decode...you gotta give them a listen!
B001QOGYB8|5.0|When I first heard word of Wes Anderson adapting one of Roald Dahl's books I of course instantly was both interested and concerned.  Being a Houstonian I have always felt inclined to support the work of Houston-born writer/director Wes Anderson.<br /><br />Thus far I've enjoyed his dry sense of humor; kind of like an Americanized version of British humor...but it is also very adult, sophisticated humor, so I couldn't imagine him doing a family movie.<br /><br />After seeing the movie I have one thing to say...Fantastic Mr. Fox certainly is FANTASTIC!  Wes Anderson has made one of the best films of 2009; one that is just as good as his other movies, if not being his best yet!  Everything, from voice-actors, to the use of stop animation: this film is perfectly balanced in what is certainly the best comedy of the year.<br /><br />How did Wes Anderson pull it off?  Well, he honestly didn't make this so much as a kid's movie as he did make another entry in his series of odd-ball comedies- only this time cutting back mature subjects to a PG-rating.  What results is a very mature comedy that doesn't resort to cheap gimmicks or slapstick for laughs (though there is a bit of slapstick for those kids who won't understand the humor in Anderson's dialog).<br /><br />The story centers on Mr. Fox (voiced by the always entertaining George Clooney), who is the foxiest fox who ever foxed.  An expert chicken thief he likes living dangerously...that is until his lover (voiced by Meryl Streep) becomes pregnant and demands that they settle down.  After getting caught in a fox trap he agrees to her terms that if they survive he shall never steal again.<br /><br />Two years later (which is far more in fox years) the couple is living in a hole with their son, Ash (Jason Schwartzmen).  Mr. Fox is a newspaper columnist, who is fairly certain no one actual reads his column and is now upset that he won't amount to anything (like his father) so he decides they must move out.  His choice is a tree, but this tree happens to be located next door to the three meanest farmers the animals have ever seen.  His lawyer, Badger (voiced by Anderson regular Bill Murray) tries to talk Fox out of his choice home, but he won't hear it.<br /><br />After moving to the tree they are joined by their nephew Kristofferson (voiced by Eric Chase Anderson) who quickly becomes Ash's center of jealousy.  Kristofferson is perfect in just about every way, spending his time meditating while practicing yoga, being naturally gifted in sports - everything Ash wishes he was.<br /><br />But while those trivial matters go on Mr. Fox can't resist the call of the wild, and with his opossum building superintendent, Kylie (voiced by Wallace Wolodarsky) plans a return to his dangerous life of \\"cussing with\\" the farmers' heads.  At first this starts as simple crimes, but soon the farmers declare war against Mr. Fox and the entire animal populace!  It becomes the job of Fox save everyone from the farmers' wrath...which he caused!<br /><br />There's also a great (not to mention HILARIOUS) bit involving Willem Dafoe as an insane, finger snapping rat-henchman under the employ of the farmers, but I wouldn't spoil that for the you! You'll have to see the movie to get what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Fantastic Mr. Fox of course differs from its source material, but for what it is Fantastic Mr. Fox is a great comedy.  I say \\"comedy\\" instead of \\"animation\\" or \\"Family\\" movie because its values really are more comedy oriented than they are trying to entertain an entire group of people.  In fact, the theater I saw this movie in was full of kids under the age of 10 and very seldom did any of them laugh: the humor was just way over their heads, and I won't hold that against them.<br /><br />For adults and mat kids over the age of 10 or so Fantastic Mr. Fox is a fantasy comedy full of whimsical characters that will leave them chuckling, and quoting its ingenious script long after they've left the theater.  Parents can also approve of the film's message of \\"everyone has their own individual talents,\\" be it thief, landscape artist, or demolitions expert.<br /><br />It won't stand up against a movie like Pixar's Up in a `Best Animated Feature' contest, but then again I doubt it was even trying to.  What the movie does is set out to be a sophisticated comedy - something that is rated PG, but is just as good as any comedy directly aimed at older audiences.  Fantastic Mr. Fox is rated PG but is more adult and sophisticated than this year's smash hit The Hangover.<br /><br />Fantastic Mr. Fox truly is the most fantastic movie of the year.their own individual talents,\\" be it thief, landscape artist, or demolitions expert.

B002T9H2LA|3.0|In my opinion the showdown in the projection room should have been between the French girl and Colonel Landa, not the French girl and the young war hero. After all, Landa had just murdered the movie star to prevent whatever was to happen in the theater. His next move, like Frank Sinatra in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, would have been to go to the projection room to investigate.    Landa killed Shoshona's entire family, so the showdown would have had more meaning with him.    Also, it was not in character for him to negotiate a house in Nantucket. We see throughout the movie what a fierce defender of the Reich he is. He would do anything to prevent the attack on the high-ranking Germans in the theater. The deal-making over the bottle of red wine and the cutting of the swastika in Landa's forehead strike me as anti-climactic and rather stupid.

B001N44BVQ|4.0|Anytime Ridley Scott is behind the camera the viewer can be assured there will be gratuitous violence presented in a most convincing manner; if you're not squirming uncomfortably you aren't watching a Ridley Scott film.  And such is very much the case with Scott's latest offering, BODY OF LIES, a taut, gripping, white-knuckle thriller set in the turbulent Middle East.  Although the general story revolves around a CIA operative in Jordan trying to find a mastermind terrorist, the overall theme has to do with trust--in particular, the lack thereof between not only the CIA and other foreign intelligence services, but between operatives of the CIA itself.<br /><br />I'm going to hate myself in the morning, but I am rapidly becoming a very big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio.  His role as CIA agent Roger Ferris--a role that takes him to several unpleasant locations and exposes him to constant danger--is gritty, believable, and nuanced as only DiCaprio can mould a character.  He's frustrated by his CIA higher-ups, including superior Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe), because of the constant roadblocks put in his path that prevents him from doing his job.  And DiCaprio's Ferris also demonstrates that all this living on the edge is wearing him razor thin--and the thread's about to snap.  Meanwhile Crowe is fun to watch as the chubby, aloof, almost disinterested \\"eye in the sky\\" following Ferris's movements on the ground; I got a kick out of him talking violent strategy with DiCaprio's character via bluetooth while he's loading his kids in the back of his station wagon.  Priceless.<br /><br />But Mark Strong as Jordanian intelligence czar Hani Salaam steals the show; he's a cold, calculating, scheming professional, and he's not hampered by the human rights issues of his American counterparts.  And in the end he gets the ultimate \\"Gotcha!\\" moment--an ending in a showdown with a room full of terrorists and a scene not for the faint of heart.  Less than five stars as the plot meanders needlessly at times, yet if it's a heart-pounding espionage thriller you're looking for BODY OF LIES will not disappoint.<br />--D.

B001VLBDD0|5.0|I went back and watched the original Terminator film before I sat down to watch this slick and entertaining sequel. While the original is darker and gritty, the sequel is much more tongue and cheek. Arnold returns as the iconic cyborg, but this time he's the good guy! Having a huge budget increase this film is much bigger with groundbreaking FX(for the time). One could argue that this is a \\"Hollywood\\" sequel that sold out, but I think what Cameron did with the sequel is pay respect to the original film and do a lot of the things he wanted to do the first time around, but couldn't because of budget restraints.<br /><br />What I love about the sequel is that the characters are much more developed and I guess that is the trade off for not being as intense as the original. This time there's a new metallic menace played wickedly cold by Robert Patrick. It would have been nice to have Lance Henriksen in this role as he was Cameron's first choice for the original Terminator, but Patrick's sleek morphing shapeshifter is a perfect counterpart to Arnold's bulky brute. The Extreme edition which I'm reviewing is disappointing as it doesn't have that much in the way of extras considering it's a two disc set unless your counting the material that can only be viewed on a computer! It also has the theatrical version of the film which is only viewable on your computer too!??? This is ridiculous, extremely irritating and down right shameful! I couldn't tell what was added to the film for the most part despite it being 16 minutes longer, but I did feel the film drag a little and this could be due to the extra footage?<br /><br />Overall this film is truly a fun time and fans of The Terminator should be happy with this installment. To me the first two films complement each other so well and neither would be as good if the other didn't exist.

There is really nothing much to keep your interest unless you like mildly entertaining bad French accents and the Martin Sheen voiceover. Too bad we couldn't have had the real Martin Sheen in this film to lend some star power, but it's the best we'll get. I can't do a bullet list of things to look out for because there just isn't anything. Even Seagal's extensive wardrobe of black (which he recycled from Into The Sun it seems) couldn't keep me amused for long. You can still cut cheese with his widow's peak but we sadly don't get to see it happen. It might have added some value to the film.  There is nearly zero entertainment value here. None. I thought Today You Die was bad, but at least that had some witty stilted jive inspired dialogue and something in the way of an ending.     I tried my best at highlighting some interesting things, but I could only 'force' up with a short paragraph:    A nonsense opening scene concerning some black box that has nothing to do with even setting Seagal up as a master fighter or soldier, guys getting thrown through paper mache walls and styrofoam pillars (lax French building codes) and surviving, Seagal sitting around for literally half the movie in a bar and no explanation as to why he's even in France, Seagal's government trying to kill him to get him to work with them (at least that's what it seemed like), the knife wound on the girl at the end switching sides and being able to clearly see her lying on the ground while Seagal is supposed to be fighting her...just some of the flaws in this film. The parts where there was action felt like I was watching a bad round of Modern Warfare 2; a bunch of faceless military guys creeping around and getting shot.     Definately one of the worst, if not THE worst Seagal film ever made.
0440242576|3.0|John Grisham has made a comfortable living writing legal thrillers for the past couple of decades. Over the years I have read most of his books and, for my money, you can't beat page-turners like The Firm, The Pelican Brief and The Runaway Jury for quality leisurely reading.  I was surprised then, a few years back, when I saw that he had deviated from his normal writing regimen to author a novel about a suburban couple who decided to \\"skip Christmas\\" and all of its accompanying hustle and bustle for one year. It sounded boring, pedestrian and very un-Grisham. I passed it over and didn't think about it again for several years.<br /><br />It so happened that my sister owned the book, however, and strongly recommended it to me last month. I was doubtful that it was worth my time but she sold me when she said I could probably finish it in one or two sittings. I was looking for something light and fun and Skipping Christmas sounded like it might just be the answer.<br /><br />Thankfully, I listened to my sister and gave the novelette my time. The story centers on Luther and Nora Crank who live in an affluent suburb of Chicago. The narrative begins as their only daughter, Blair, joins the Peace Corps and leaves for her first mission to South America. The Kranks are understandably disappointed she won't be home for the holidays and lament that it won't be the same without her. As Christmas approaches they face the usual distractions and annoyances of the season (i.e. long lines, crowded malls, busy traffic, sending Christmas cards to relatives you never talk to, solicitors representing a million different charities and causes, etc.).<br /><br />Grisham does a fine job of relating these all-too-true seasonal events with humor and grace.  He does an amazing of recreating a busy mall scene in all of its over-crowded, gaudy commercialism splendor.<br /><br />Fed up with the fake \\"spirit\\" of the season and forced generosity, the Kranks inexplicably decide to \\"skip Christmas\\" and opt, instead, for a discounted Caribbean cruise that departs on Christmas day. The storyline follows the Kranks as they deliberately skip and neglect Christmas parties, Christmas decorating, gift-buying, and other holiday contraptions. In their place are visits to tanning salons, strict dieting, and unintended social consequences.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert!<br /><br />Just two days before Christmas the Kranks receive an unexpected phone call from their daughter Blair, who announces she is engaged and returning home for Christmas with her Brazilian fianc&eacute;. She tells her parents she can't wait to show him a Christmas back home in the States. Hilarity ensues as the Kranks scramble to cancel their cruise and prepare for Christmas in one day. In the end Luther and Nora are reminded why they do enjoy and love Christmas despite the hectic schedules, commercialism, and busyness of the season.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert Over!<br /><br />Memorable Excerpt:<br /><br />\\"Well!!\\" he said dramatically, shoving his plate forward. \\"Now that you mention it. There's something I want to discuss with you.\\"<br /><br />\\"Finish your pasta.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm finished,\\" he announced, jumping to his feet. His briefcase was just a few steps away, and he attacked it.<br /><br />\\"Luther, what are you doing?\\"<br /><br />\\"Hang on.\\"<br /><br />He stood across the table from her, papers in both hands. \\"Here's my idea,\\" he said proudly. \\"And it's brilliant.\\"<br /><br />\\"Why am I nervous?\\"<br /><br />He unfolded a spreadsheet, and began pointing. \\"Here, my dear, is what we did last Christmas. Six thousand, one hundred dollars we spent on Christmas. Six thousand, one hundred dollars.\\"<br /><br />\\"I heard you the first time.\\"<br /><br />\\"And precious little to show for it. The vast majority of it down the drain. Wasted. And that, of course, does not include my time, your time, the traffic, stress, worry, bickering, ill-will, sleep loss - all the wonderful things that we pour into the holiday season.\\"<br /><br />\\"Where is this going?\\"<br /><br />\\"Thanks for asking.\\" Luther dropped the spreadsheets and, quick as a magician, presented the Island Princess to his wife. Brochures covered the table.  \\"Where is this going, my dear? It's going to the Caribbean. Ten days of total luxury on the Island Princess, the fanciest cruise ship in the world. The Bahamas, Jamaica, Grand Cayman, oops, wait a minute.\\"<br /><br />Luther dashed into the den, hit the Play button, waited for the first notes, adjusted the volume, then dashed back to the kitchen where Nora was inspecting a brochure.<br /><br />\\"What's that?\\" she asked.<br /><br />\\"Reggae, the stuff they listen to down there. Anyway, where was I?\\"<br /><br />\\"You were island hopping.\\"<br /><br />\\"Right, we'll snorkel on Grand Cayman, windsurf in Jamaica, lie on the beaches. Ten days, Nora, ten fabulous days.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'll have to lose some weight.\\"<br /><br />\\"We'll both go on a diet. Whatta you say?\\"<br /><br />\\"What's the catch?\\"<br /><br />\\"The catch is simple. We don't do Christmas. We save the money, and spend it on ourselves for once. Not a dime on food we won't eat or clothes we won't wear or gifts no one needs. Not one red cent.

She'll be back next year and we can jump back into the Christmas chaos, if that's what you want. Come on, Nora, please. We skip Christmas, save the money, and go splash in the Caribbean for ten days.\\"<br /><br />\\"How much will it cost?\\"<br /><br />\\"Three thousand bucks.\\"<br /><br />\\"So we save money?\\"<br /><br />\\"Absolutely.\\"<br /><br />\\"When do we leave?\\"<br /><br />\\"High noon, Christmas day.\\"<br /><br />They stared at each other for a long time.<br /><br />Conclusion: This book does not come with a strong recommendation to read or not read. It is simply a light, fun seasonal story. If that's what you're looking for this holiday season, I urge you to check this book out. If not, simply pass on it. There are mild religious overtones throughout the story as the Kranks insist to neighbors and friends from church that they're still going to celebrate Christ's birth; that they're merely passing on the commercial and secular aspects of the holiday.

0743201140|5.0|Beginning with the national bestsellers, First, Break All the Rules and Now, Discover Your Strengths, Marcus Buckingham is on a single-minded quest to focus on unique abilities that energize and sustain top performance. It's a philosophy that works for high performing teams as well: focus on and leverage the strengths people bring to a team. People on high performance teams report they call upon their strengths more than 75 percent of the time. More importantly, \\"a good team member deliberately volunters his strengths to the team most of the time.\\" Buckingham contends that when you \\"pull this lever [focus your strengths], an engaged and productive team will be the result. Fail to pull it, and no matter what else is done to motivate the team, it'll never fully engage. It will never become a high performance team.\\" How can you tell? Buckingham provides a \\"dial\\" to show how engaged an individual's strengths are and, when combined, an entire team's strengths. He also shares a very practical, six week action plan to identify and play to peoples' strengths. How cook is that?
B000003C5C|5.0|This is a classic deathmetal band.  It is a must have in any ones cd collection.
B000FDVOXO|5.0|I went back and watched the original Terminator film before I sat down to watch this slick and entertaining sequel. While the original is darker and gritty, the sequel is much more tongue and cheek. Arnold returns as the iconic cyborg, but this time he's the good guy! Having a huge budget increase this film is much bigger with groundbreaking FX(for the time). One could argue that this is a \\"Hollywood\\" sequel that sold out, but I think what Cameron did with the sequel is pay respect to the original film and do a lot of the things he wanted to do the first time around, but couldn't because of budget restraints.<br /><br />What I love about the sequel is that the characters are much more developed and I guess that is the trade off for not being as intense as the original. This time there's a new metallic menace played wickedly cold by Robert Patrick. It would have been nice to have Lance Henriksen in this role as he was Cameron's first choice for the original Terminator, but Patrick's sleek morphing shapeshifter is a perfect counterpart to Arnold's bulky brute. The Extreme edition which I'm reviewing is disappointing as it doesn't have that much in the way of extras considering it's a two disc set unless your counting the material that can only be viewed on a computer! It also has the theatrical version of the film which is only viewable on your computer too!??? This is ridiculous, extremely irritating and down right shameful! I couldn't really tell what was different with the film despite being 16 minutes longer, but I did feel the film drag a little and this could be due to the extra footage?<br /><br />Overall this film is truly a fun time and fans of The Terminator should be happy with this installment. To me the two films complement each other so well and neither would be as good if the other didn't exist.
0679804021|1.0|I read the opening sentence presented on Amazon's site and checked it by the original book I have with a 1957 copyright.  They were the same, so I felt confident that I was getting the genuine Treasure Island.  What I received was a child's version in a totally different style.  I didn't save anything over buying the original at my local Barnes and Noble store.  Why do they advertise one thing and send another?!  Be very careful.
0312263511|5.0|I've read the Andrew Chaikin book, Man on the Moon, about the Apollo program and thought that it told all the secrets of the space program - Apollo, in particular.  And then I bought Last Man on the Moon and learned there were so many more behind the scenes actions and happenings that influenced history to unfold the way it did.  After reading this book, I am more interested in even the Gemini and Mercury missions, finding that there was so much more to those missions than I ever knew.  The risks taken and dangers faced were very real on almost every space mission we undertook.  Cernan, as a veteran of Gemini and two Apollo flights, does a great job of making us realize how real it all was.  He is particularly generous in his perspective on the wives of the space program and brings new insight into that aspect as well.      It won't win any literary awards, but then it's not that kind of book.  What it will do is put you in his place and in the middle of the height of the space program.  He also does a good job of keeping things in perspective by occassionally reflecting on current events of the day, both cultural and political.  I would highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in the space program leading up to and including Apollo.  Cernan is candid (perhaps to a fault at times in his characterizations of other astronauts) but honest and that is what makes this book so appealing.  He shows that the astronauts were real men, with real families, real strengths, real weaknesses and unique qualifications, dealing with real dangers, countless unknowns, dramatic risks, and unstoppable drive, initiative and motivation.    Apollo 11 was not the beginning or even the pinnacle, as many tend to characterize it.  Rather, it was, as Neil Armstrong implied, one of many steps.  It was not the first step nor was it the last.  And hopefully Cernan's own flight on Apollo 17 will not be the last steps for America's and the world's spirit of exploration and adventure.
B0030UYXG4|5.0|I can totally relate to SLEEPING WITH A BROKEN HEART, and I loved DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

6304576935|5.0|Star Trek First Contact is a GREAT TNG movie with tons of action and tons of laughs.<br />The movie takes place in I think 2063, after the 3rd world war, and most governments have been screwed. The Borg have attacked that time to assimilate earth in the past, to prevent them from making \\"First Contact\\"(with Vulcans that is) So the crew of the Enterprise have to fight off the Borg while helping the man that made first contact to succeed in executing the first ever warp drive. That character Mr Cochran is very funny, it's like in TNG's time he was portrayed as a HERO, yet in his mind, he's in it for the money, booze, and girls.<br /><br />Now about the VHS, I have the Widescreen VHS tape, the quality is fair, though the it's a bit \\"meh\\" at times, though it could be because I'm watching it on an old late 70's to mid 80's TV.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to any new Trekkie, this is my second favorite Trek movie.
0439023491|5.0|I just finished reading this book only to find that I have to wait almost a year for the next book! I shouldn't have read the past two so quickly! This book is a good as the first book and as well written with new, deep, and interesting characters. Highly recommended for readers who like fast paced, a little romance, slight sci-fi themed, solid story, and well written books.
B002ZXGSWE|3.0|Firstly, the rating format for tv series that amazon.com has set up is, IMO, absurd. Do they really think each and every episode should have its own viewer review. That would mean that I, with a TV pass, would write 20 reviews for this TV series this season.    Does amazon.com suppose that a viewer is going to pick one episode out of twenty, totally out of context with the other nineteen, watch it, understand it, and appreciate it? IMO . . . NO.    So I will write a review up to this episode . . . and then promptly watch it get lost as the other episodes role by . . . unless, prospective viewers go through each and every one of the twenty episodes and read every one.    Now for the review so far . . . the much bigger budget for Stargate Universe as compared to Stargate Atlantis is easily recognized in the quality of the set and the CG creativity. The main story line shows much promise and originality, the main story line being a group of civilians and military personnel stranded on a several 100,000 year old space cruiser over which they have little control as it speeds through space.    The kernel of each episode is cantered on the problems encountered while trying to keep the star cruiser running, but the script writers have taken the linear story style of Stargate Atlantis and set it on its head. About 7 out of the 9 episodes I've watched more or less use a very disruptive story telling style, IMO. Perhaps is is just my taste in film style, but I personally find the sudden and frequent changes in time between the present, the past and sometimes the future very disruptive and distressing to watch and I'm talking 15 to 20 seconds between changes from present to past, to future than back to the present. Thanks to the streaming video I am able to fast forward through these horrible ordeals.    Additionally, the script writers have written in sudden changes from reality to fantasy such as memories, flight of imagination and such things which are portrayed in a realistic style and therefore extremely hard to follow, and detracts from he main story development which is surviving on this several 100,000 year old star cruiser.    The writers seem to have decided that character development is to be done by cutting from the main activity on the star cruiser using this choppy style. It is very similar to the style used in the TV series \\"Lost\\" and equally annoying and irrelevant. It is almost as if the writers have to insert this horrible content that IMO adds nothing to the plot except extending and filling out the episodes like they couldn't think of anything else to do.    Ultimately, I find myself very often watching in suspense and interest only to be drowned in vanilla cut scenes to personal events in the characters past that does absolutely nothing for the plot or character development that could not have been done in one tenth the time in a more conventional style such as that used on the two previous Stargate series.    This TV series has the potential to be a 5 star rating. I gave it 3 and would have given it 2 1/2 if I could have because of the botched up writing of the script.    I find this rather tragic as the concept is great and the acting is more than adequate. I hope the writers stop screwing it up and get their script writing together.    I recommend this TV series only if you are willing to put up with the 7 out of every ten minutes of crap, IMO, for the three minutes out of ten that are truly great cinema.

B0014NDXGA|4.0|The Tour V2 is lightweight and easy to use.  Point at the flag or edge of trees and bam.  It can even read to the edge of a sand trap, but I don't know how accurate that yardage is.  Otherwise very accurate.   I liked that I did not need a subscription as with a GPS unit.  It does take a little longer than simply looking down at a GPS unit. Battery is cheap but carry and extra one in your bag.  I do not think there is a low battery indicator.
1401323820|3.0|I absolutely love the TV show. The book, however, not so much. It tries to capture the humor of the show, and does so moderately well. If anyone wondered about the page mentioned on the show, the answer is yes. There is a \\"steamy\\" scene on that page.<br />As a literary work, it fails miserably. It's half the length of most hardcover books, because the writer just summarizes the story instead of actually writing it. Where most books will have a page or two detailing a conversation, this one condenses them to a paragraph-length recap. Action in the book is similarly condensed. It's like the writer put together an outline and sold it that way rather than fleshing anything out.<br />I bought it to support the show. I would love to see more Castle over the next couple of years.<br />I do not want to read any more of \\"his\\" books. :-P
6302306485|5.0|Great movie! I loved that the cast of Star Trek TOS had to go to 80's America. Also the jokes and gags are hilarious, like when Chekov was talking to the officer(mind you it's the mid 80's and he's russian) asking \\"May you please tell me where the Nuclear WESSELLS are in Alameda\\", or when Kirk tells Gillian that Spock had a little to much LDS.<br />Though most \\"Trekkies\\" probably don't like it because there's not enough fighting or space action, this is my ABSOLUTE favorite Star Trek film,and one of my 5 favorite films of all time.<br /><br />Now about the VHS tape I have, the '91 directors edition, it's fair though the random commercial about renting videos was a bit random(the dog rents a movie and it's normal O_o). The introduction interview with Mr. Nimoy was okay, but a bit bland at most. The Widescreen is GREAT much better than full screen, which was more popular in it's time.<br /><br /> In the all in all I'd recommend the Movie to most people who like Star Trek and Comedies. Though the Director's edition Widescreen VHS is more a collector's item, the special edition DVD would be more \\"Logical\\" to purchase.
0439023483|5.0|This is one of my favorite books! The writing style is extremely addicting and fast pace. All of the characters have depth and history. The story line is new and exciting and pulls you into the story. I have never gone through a book so quickly! I don't know why this is considered a children book though. It has some serious themes and gets a little gory, but in a satisfying way. I'm a picky reader. The writing style of the author is very important to me as is the main character. The book had a great leading female character, who is very strong and competent. The author doesn't repeat phrases, have shallow or washed up characters, and the plot is sci-fi futurey, which is my favorite.<br />The instant I was done with this book I got the other one and read that one just as quick! I can't stand that the third book isn't coming out for almost another year!!!
0385504225|3.0|First and foremost, if you have read either of the other two books in Dan Brown's \\"Langdon series\\", there should be no surprises concerning what you are purchasing.  \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is definitely not a bad book, but it is not one that you will keep on the bookshelf long after your first reading.  After finishing the book the first time, I almost read it again...not because it was entertaining, but because I forgot it almost the moment I sat it down...it was a very mindless read.      Regarding the plot, it does not possess the same charm that made \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" so appealing.  While a work of fiction, one of the most entertaining aspects of Brown's previous novel was that unless extremely knowledgeable on early Christian history, it was often easy to believe Brown's conjecture.  This is certainly not the case with \\"The Lost Symbol\\".  It's almost as if Brown got the idea from a bad Nicolas Cage movie and did all his research on Wikipedia.      Furthermore, the dialogue does nothing to help the weak plot.  It is unbelievable, at best, and often devolves into mindless monologues during extremely tense situations.      All this being said...let me reiterate that it was not a bad book.  I would, however, strongly suggest that you wait for it to be published in paperback or check it out from a public library, as it is definitely not a book that will be read mroe than once.  In fact, I donated my copy to the local library book drive just a week after reading.
0307454541|1.0|the writing was excellent but at about page 475, at the most exciting time in the story, where the hero is caught by the serial killer, and sent into the torture chamber................20 pages are missing and replaced with pages 123- 144 which I had already read, WTF?

B001M5UDGS|5.0|I should start by saying this isn't a crowd-pleaser, some people love this and some just don't.     I loved it, it was the right kind of funny and I watched it several times and find myself singing the songs.
0691142165|2.0|This book will certainly satisfy those individuals preparing to become the next Roubinis of the world.  Although the authors must have devoted many hours to this book, the reading for the average econowannabe is very dry until you get to chapters 14 - 17.  If you are the type of person who wants to get to the crux of the matter, go directly to those chapters.  If you plan on getting an MBA in Economics, read the whole thing.
1593082800|3.0|It is rare for a heroine to be ugly. One of the elements that makes \\"Jane Eyre\\" a perfect romance is that Jane is physically unattractive, just as the author Charlotte Bronte perceived herself to be. In Collins' novel also, the heroine's plainness makes her a more sympathetic character.<br /><br />Britain produced some great Victorian novelists and Collins is one of them. He is a superb stylist, making this book a pleasure to read. It does however, suffer from the 'curse of the coincidence', requiring the reader to believe that the hero just happens to be in the right place at the right time to meet the right person, not once but repeatedly. In fact the opening episode contains a coincidence so great that I almost gave up on the book there and then. Despite this clumsy plotting, the story contains much that is good, not least one of the most memorable villains in all literature. I find the hero himself rather exasperating. He hesitates and dithers, insisting always on being the perfect English gentleman while the evil foreigners run rings round him. I kept wanting to grab him by the shoulders and shake some sense into him.<br /><br />British novels, probably more than those of any other culture, are notable for their character portraits. \\"The Woman in White\\" is a fine example of that, as well as being wonderfully atmospheric. By common consent, this and \\"The Moonstone\\" are the author's two worthwhile works, so if you enjoy one you can go on to read the other, and be satisfied that you have 'done' Collins.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Oh, right,..\\"thinking\\" had no part in their decision to cancel this show!  I'm not a crazed, organized fan. I'm a middle aged woman with college and two teens under my belt.    I have bought and given away more copies of this show than I can count, because it is one of the best gifts I can imagine.  Hours and hours of wit, humor, and heart.  When's the last time you could say that about a tv show?    I fell in love with these characters, every one of them.  I mourn a little every time I rewatch an episode.   I'm left with the only conclusion available to me,..Joss must have really pissed off someone at Fox,...or the crime of canceling Firefly could not have happened.  Their loss, our loss,...now,..let's all go watch another episode of \\"More to Love\\",....nah,..I'd rather have some dental work done!
B000R8YC18|5.0|If you want a sappy uplifting movie, go buy 'You Light Up My Life\\" or \\"The Sound Of Music.\\"  If you dare to peer into the seedy side of life and the descent into madness, HERE IS!<br /><br />Martin Scorcese's classic Taxi Driver is the quintessential \\"Through The Looking Glass\\" examination of how a man becomes an island in a city of millions.  The Classic Anti-Hero, Travis Bickle, (Robert DeNero, \\"Henry Krinkle\\") is all too pathetic, all too pitiful in the way that he wrenches from you pure disgust of his persona.  Everyone sometime in life have felt that crushing loneliness he goes through, but few people compound that loneliness in layers as he does.  It seems that his every action feeds his problems until he loses contact with reality, and his fantasies take control to turn him into a killing machine.  Through Travis' eyes and mind we see the worst of society.  Travis seems to incorporate all these defects into his own personality.<br /><br />Through stop action, repeating a scene and close ups of Travis' diary you get a glimpse into Travis' twisted mind.  Travis prefers to stare at dissolving Alka Seltzer than to pay attention to reality.  Travis cannot accept life as it is.  He sees people as either scum or angels.  Yet he can only relate to the things he hates the most.<br /><br />Scorsesee in his commentary states that the ending of Taxi Driver is a portrayal of the anti-hero becoming the hero, only to be cocked and ready to be triggered again into another \\"episode.\\" I think that the ending is merely Travis' psychotic fantasy dream as he is dying.  Real life does not operate the way Travis dreams it must operate.  As in the movie \\"All That Jazz\\" the main character's death is all choreographed in his own mind.<br /><br />Dare to relive this nighhtmare!  DeNiro's performance is so realisticly tragic that even the camera at times cannot take looking at him, and would rather pan an empty hallway than look at Travis and his pitiful condition!
B0028RXXFC|5.0|Ok, I don't have much to say. The series is great, in blu ray it's a whole new experience, and the box set is one of the best i've seen. Check the pictures, the quality is fantastic.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Unfortunately I was almost kind of hoping this thing wouldn't be worth the money.  At Amazon, you have the advantage of returning something for any reason but I'll have to hang on to this set.  I think this comes close to a virgin vinyl listen.  It's crisp, clean, higher volume and I have all ready heard things I have not heard before...but I should mention I say this almost every time I REALLY listen to their music but the crispness has made a difference.<br /><br />To really objectively critique this set I suppose one really needs to listen to the vinyl, the old version CD's and then this remastered version to make a definitive opinion but I have to say I don't think there's any question these CD's are superior to the previous releases.  It seems to me their number one objective was to maximize the sound quality and be as close to the original album/45 releases as possible...I believe they were successful.<br /><br />Is it worth picking up the entire box set versus picking up a couple CD's here and there until you have them all?  That's a personal choice and I see nothing wrong with that at all.  I will say this, it's been a long time since I stayed up until 4 in the morning with headphones and really, really listen to music.  I hate to say it but it is worth upgrading to these remastered CD's. They really sound superb, they really do.

B000H6SXMY|2.0|I ordered this as a gift for my girlfriend. However the box came slightly damaged and it was obvious it was not from shipping. Also the discs came all mixed up and out of order. I wasn't very impressed with its quality. However I may buy CD cases so that the disks do not become scratched!

B000EF5NAS|5.0|I had been trying to find this item in store for quite some time and to no avail.    Amazon always has just what I have been looking for and lo and behold they stocked this as well.    Thanks again Amazon, and Merry Christmas,
B00005NOOH|3.0|The series is brilliant.    Locking it away with a $400 price tag is offensive.
0385504225|2.0|What a time-waster of a book!  Like Masons have big secrets--they believe in the Universe!  Several times I was rooting for the bad buy, but once again the bad guy has to have some physical deformity by which you will know him.  In this one, tattoos all over his body--in DaVinci Code, it was an albino.  The main character has a \\"swimmer's body\\" which shows that he is good.  Not smart, but good.  And if you make a drinking game, try drinking a shot for every time the word \\"myth\\" appears in this book.  I like the way none of the government employees in this book seems to have a clue.  About anything, but they have keys to everywhere.  I think that the CIA official was also made into a red herring by making her tiny and Japanese with a hoarse voice.  Because every Dan Brown admirer knows that you should \\"judge a book by its cover.\\"  Also, these are curiously sexless books.  There are women, but Dan Brown doesn't seem to know what to do with them.
1607960001|5.0|I first bought \\"Elements of Style\\" in 1967 while in college and it collected a lot of dust. However when I started practicing law in 1980 and writing legal briefs for federal courts including writs for cert before the US Supreme Court I pulled it again. This time with seriousness and found it an effective tool for perfecting my grammar and gained a new appreciation for the art of brevity. One of my 2009 Christmas presents to my son who is starting graduate school is.....you guessed it- Elements of Style. Bravo to Professor White for a work that is defies time as it is as relevant today as 30 years ago. [[ASIN:9562916464 The Elements of Style (Original Edition)]]
B002C6K7N0|5.0|This CD is EXCELLENT.  As a true Megadeth fan, I belive this album is the best album since Countdown and in the top 3 overall.
031604461X|5.0|Ordered this for my sister-in-law for Christmas. I'm not into the whole thing but it's all she asked for. Anyway it has the DVD and all so I figured for the price it was a good deal. But I didn't know it also has some song lyrics and an interview with the author in the back pages of the book. Also the poster that is on the inside of the dust jacket looks really cool. It isn't a photograph but rather pencil drawing. Anyway she's gonna have a cow with all the little bonuses it came with.
0385504225|3.0|Dan Brown's latest novel, \\"The Lost Symbol,\\" proves that he is a victim of his own success.  While treasure hunts have been thrilling readers for generations, Brown virtually re-invented the sub-genre with his symbol-focused thrillers featuring Robert Langdon.  Thanks to his stratospheric success, this category of thrillers has been overplayed to death (think the History Channel, recent Nic Cage movies, etc.).  And yet we still buy this book in droves - Brown's probably made $100 million since its release.    What can you say about the plot?  Robert Langdon, Harvard prof and symbologist, is back and this time he's tracking down clues in Washington D.C.  A demented madman has kidnapped Langdon's friend and mentor, leaving a grisly trophy/clue behind in a very prominent DC landmark.  We follow the usual Langdon M.O. - nothing is as it appears at first; vital clues have been hidden in plain sight for the learned to decipher; and people dead for hundreds of years knew vastly more about human nature than we do today.      Look for short chapters, lots of italics, and a maddening number of chapters that end with one character making a shocked realization, only to lead into a chapter involving a parallel track of the novel.  Brown writes the perfect airplane book, and yet \\"The Lost Symbol\\" seems to be more wheezy than thrilling.  Maybe it's because we've been here before - the names have changed a bit, but the song remains the same.    All in all, a pedestrian effort by Mr. Brown that is sure to spark its own industry in symbol-related tourism to Washington DC.
0575083093|3.0|Any writer that pays homage to Iain M. Banks by christening a spaceship \\"Nostalgia for Infinity\\" gets an extra star. Not accidentally, the most enjoyable parts of the novel take place inside the spaceship. Some other facts I appreciated about Revelation Space:<br /><br />1. Interesting Fermi Paradox solution.<br />2. Conscious attempt to abide by physics laws. So, no magical FTL drives.<br />3. Nice and inventive new concepts, even including a spaceship with a penthouse view.<br /><br />On the other hand, nobody's perfect. Reynolds does not possess glowing writing craftsmanship, which means that an editor could cut off some of the irritating \\"svinoi\\" expletives a main character monotonously uses in about 100 years of action, not to mention some cliches like the following gem: \\"Sylveste thought of himself as a machine in which Calvin was about to become the ghost...\\" Come on now Mr Reynolds, this is how SF writers used to write at around the time the Asteroid arcade game was invented.<br /><br />So, in a nutshell: The writer has a very creative imagination, comes up with fresh and new ideas, much like Cordwainer Smith once upon a time did, but without his literary skill. Overall, a nice read, 3 1/2 stars.
0755331451|5.0|One of the classics. I just love this story. Postage was fast. A great transaction. Thank you.
0689865384|5.0|Reads fast, carries a message without beating the reader over the head, and pushes the imagination out in all directions. A very coherent book with plenty of good characters. Finds its target, zooms in on it, blows it up and keeps on going. I loved it.
B002T9H2LK|3.0|Although still a great director, Quentin Tarantino the writer, in his last 3 films (Kill Bill Vol. 2, Death Proof and Inglourious Basterds) has become a long-winded, self-indulgent bore. Basterds is easily the best of those 3, but it's still bloated with never-ending pointless scenes that should have been heavily edited or deleted. He's also run out of ideas for satisfying or shocking payoffs to those scenes. If he made Pulp Fiction today, it would need to be a trilogy because Jackson and Travolta would be discussing the Royale with Cheese for 45 minutes. He can still make excellent movies if someone can convince him to hire a screenplay editor.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I was a big fan of \\"ST: The Next Generation\\" with Capt Picard and Data, etc..     So I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy this 're-launch' with the original characters of Spock, Kirk, etc.    But I must say that the storyline was a good one that kept me interested and back into the \\"Trek\\" family.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|As a fan of Hayao Miyazaki's many other animated films, I thoroughly enjoyed Ponyo. Though it is slightly more childish and innocent than Miyazaki's other stories, it was a pure delight!     As I suspected, Ponyo is loosely based on The Little Mermaid. She is a little fish who washes up on shore to have a young boy discover and befriend her. Sosuke and Ponyo soon become very close friends and they share an innocent love for each other. But Ponyo longs to be human (hence the little mermaid reference) and her father, Fujimoto, who watches over the sea, is worried this transformation will upset the balance of nature. Sosuke must prove his love for Ponyo for things to go unscathed.    Obviously what makes this movie is the beautiful artwork. It is so imaginative and breathtaking; half the time I was simply admiring the art. The story is very different from Miyazaki's other films. Whereas Spirited Away is more of a lesson and a deep, moving, story, Ponyo is much more lighthearted and fun. I could not stop laughing throughout the movie!! When Ponyo yells HAM you will laugh just as hard, trust me. And her little mannerisms, along with the innocence of childhood, are just delightful and make you want to giggle the whole time.    Ponyo is a definite must-see for all Miyazaki fans, of course, but also for anyone who appreciates well-drawn art and a simple, fun story.    HAAAAM!
1423119509|5.0|Being a big Harry Potter fan, I was skeptical with the hype around the Percy Jackson books. I went to my local library, read the 3rd book first and decided to have a go and purchased the box set.<br /><br />I was very impressed with the way Rick Riordan was able to modernize the Greek gods of mythology without making it sound cliche or corny. It is a very fast paced book, especially The Last Olympian. It is action packed, a rip roaring adventure that is highly enjoyable. Riordan always makes the last chapter an introduction to the next book that I am glad I already had all the books to read.<br /><br />Apparently, another Camp Half-Blood (the summer camp for all the demi-gods) book is in the works. I am truly looking forward to another adventure with Percy, Annabeth and Grover.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle is an angel from heaven.  She is humble, sweet and down-to-earth.  Anyone who can make Simon Cowell melt with a smile on his face, has to have angelic powers.  Her voice is one that simply put \\"lifts your spirit out of the doldrums.\\"  I can't get enough of her audition video, and I often pull it up when I am depressed or feeling stressed, and it instantly makes me feel better.  Thank goodness Simon has taken her under his wing and protected her from the sharks as much as possible.  Way to go Susan, I am looking forward to your next CD.  You have brought honor to your country and to each person who has dreamed of being more than what the world has defined them to be.
B002R68U7K|3.0|I bought this Singles BOX collection and I think it's OK, but not what we all deserved. First of all: the singles come in CARDSLEEVE which is not that bad but they are really cheap quality cardsleeves, I mean, the cardsleeve of 4 of the singles that came in the box are almost ungluing, they could have made it better. Second: the discs do NOT have the original arts, all discs are BLACK (in the same style of the black box where the singles came in). Why don't keep the original arts on the discs? Third: why don't include more tracks on each disc instead of including only 2? Fourth: the box is TOO small and the singles are all so pressed in there, it's hard to take off and place back the CD's from the box. Fifth and worst: they keep advertising in product's description that the box is \\"accompanying booklet of iconic images and never-before-seen photographs\\". It's a LIE! It's a LIE! The booklet is made with high quality glossy paper BUT it includes ONLY bad quality pictures from Britney's videos taken directly FROM the videos (not from a photo shoot or something like that). This single box is really NOT what I expected but at least we have a lot of (rare?) tracks and original artworks of the singles, plus the DVD (which unfortunately does NOT include all of Britney's videos).
B001AQMBJQ|5.0|Every Season of Lost has been impressive but the last two seasons 4 & 5 have been totally amazing.  They are so watchable - you can't stop till you've seen every episode - then when you finish, after the surprise ending - you'll want to go back and rewatch the entire season again.    I had already seen this season twice on DVR, finished the third time on Blu-Ray, and am watching it again- that goes to show just how brilliant and captivating this show is.    There were many big risks in season 5 but all of them payed off beautifully and fans of the show will literally be blown away by season 5 - I've seen all five amazing seasons but this is the best yet!
B002Q0F6V0|4.0|I was 16 when I first ordered Alice in Chains - Unplugged through one of the \\"13 CDs for 1 penny\\" deals back in '96. I listened to this album non-stop and fell in love with AIC's sound. It's been a long time coming but all I can say is the new stuff is great, even with a new singer its very impressive, it's AIC, the AIC I grew up with. I feel like I'm 16 again, thanks for a great album AIC!
B001GCUO1Q|3.0|The Bottom Line:    After a cool opening credit sequence (that adds this film, along with other luminaries like America's Sweethearts, to the list of films that peak before 10 minutes have elapses) Wolverine devolves into a rather bland \\"origin story\\" that's made even more redundant by the fact that those of us who have seen the first three X-men movies know exactly where things are going; though Jackman and (especially) Schrieber give it their all, there's not a lot here to like.    2.5/4
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Excellent 3 disc collection. Fast paced adventure action. Recommend for ALL age groups. If your are a \\"Trekkie\\" then this is a great addition to your collection.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|I just got this set in the mail and immediately popped the DVD in. I was pleased to notice that 1) it is over 2 hours long and 2) it has the option for DTS sound, which is GREAT I might add.    More than 30 songs!    While many songs were on prior DVD releases, many were not.    It was great that Paul also included songs written by George Harrison and John Lennon!    The \\"edited in\\" footage of The Beatles performing at Shea Stadium on the song \\"I'm Down\\" is a Beatle fan's \\"dream come true\\". To see the footage of the fab-four performing at Shea Stadium during their youth brings back a lot of great memories for Baby-Boomers and Beatle Fans.    I'll put the CDs in my vehicle, but this set is worth the price just for the DVD alone! Don't pass it up if you're a McCartney/Beatle fan!
B002HWRYJE|2.0|If you crave video games and CGI's then this movie's for you.  However, if you want more from script and direction then altered personalities; biker style Romulans (with dialogue to match); and leading players who look and sound like your local High School troupe, then you may find this film wanting.
B001F12J48|3.0|Not sure if it's my equipements, but I bought 2 different 3D movies (Polar Express and Journey to the Center of the Earth), they both look very colorless in the 3D version. First, when you slap on the 3D glasses (and I bought the quality 3D plastic glasses, not the paper glasses given with the movie box), the red eye looks dark, like a blind eye. You can only see out of the blue eye. When we adjust the brightness/contrast, you can see more with the red eye, but the movie appears not as vividly. The 2D version shows much better color. And this 3D version is nothing like the 3D in the theater when we saw this at IMAX. We could see the \\"golden ticket\\" flying in front of your face. This home-version 3D doesn't do that. It's very barely 3D in our opinion.
0861714911|5.0|Even a casual student of literature and philosophy would find the text of the Pali Canon striking.  Here is the original form of the parable regarding the blind men who encounter the different parts of an elephant and form widely divergent and strongly held opinions on what an elephant is like.  I've heard this parable told in many contexts for all my life but never realized that Buddha was the first to use it 2500 years ago.<br /><br />Many other images will grab the mind as one pages through this wonderful translation.  On one page, Buddha grabs a handful of leaves and asks his listeners which was more numerous, the leaves in his hand or the leaves still on the trees in the surrounding grove.  When they gave the obvious answer, he tells them that the leaves overhead are like the knowledge that  Buddha knows, but the leaves in his hand are like the knowledge that Buddha is teaching, because he is only teaching what is relevant and beneficial for the spiritual life and what will lead directly to Enlightenment.  On the facing page, the reader will find an equally striking metaphor of a steep precipice used to show the pitfalls of a life lived without spiritual reflection or striving towards enlightenment.  I love the way the translator includes a chart of such striking images in the back of the book so that it is easy to look these up again.<br /><br />The translator has tried to be faithful and accurate to the text, sometimes with no regard for the music of the language when read aloud. When dealing with something like this, I will vote for clear English over beautiful English!  The scholarly merits of this work is enhanced by an excellent organization of the material and by the notes that precede each chapter.  I frequently found myself reading the chapters, than turning back to the notes for a more complete understanding of what I was reading. The passages of poetry do, by and large, succeed as poetry in English which is a notable accomplishment of translation in and of itself.<br /><br />A translator faces many difficulties especially when trying to translate a traditional text into a modern language and context. The translator discusses some of these in his General Introduction and it is important that the reader not skip this in a big hurry to get to the text itself. The main thing that the reader must understand is how the translator deals with the frequent repetitive sections in which the same thing may be said five times over.  Here the first and last sections are given in full and the repeating sections are represented by \\"...\\".  This can take a little getting used to but I found this to be a good method.  It was better practice to mentally put in what was taken out rather than to be mentally skipping multiple lines.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to persons of a philosophical mind set in general or to English-speaking seekers of Enlightenment in particular.  This is a book that repays those who spend time with it. I have had it only since September 2009 and as I write this review in December of the same year I note that my copy already has many dog-ears and double dog-ears where I have folded down a page so as to be able to easily revisit a passage.  I am not normally so rough with my books but as the song says, you only hurt the ones you love.A translator faces many difficulties especially when trying to translate a traditional text into a modern language and context.

You get the cool fights and explosions with the high def graphics that really make a difference. It has a big cast if your familiar with the British acting scene. It touches on the old subject of take a stand against something that's not right, but a cool and new futuristic spin. It was taken from a graphic novel series so it has a real dark feel. I love this film and highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good action packed movie with a drama backbone.

0767827902|5.0|This black and white film very effectively -- even painfully -- captures the pointless desolation, and pervasive banality of a small 1950's Texas oil town.  The film's signature line is delivered by \\"Sam the Lion,\\" owner of the town's decrepit pool hall, diner, and soon-to-close movie theater:  \\"I've been puttin' up with this kind of trashy behavior all my life.\\"  This after local teenagers, more bored and adrift than mean spirited, pay a morbidly obese whore to service Sam's mentally retarded son.  Confusion, humiliation, nastyness, and shame are the predictable outcomes.<br /><br />Sam is a kind man who knew love once, but she married for oil money.  She remembers Sam proudly, though, and remains possessive of the fact of his past adoration.<br /><br />Sonny, one of the local teens, sensitive, well-meaning, and easily misled, knew love, too, with the wife of his red neck football coach.  But he broke her heart when, just for the Hell of it, the daughter or a rich oil man, husband of Sam's long-lost love, effortlessly led Sonny into an affair which came to nothing, just as she had planned.<br /><br />Cloris Leachman's performance as the dispirited wife of the football coach is brilliant.  When Sam's son is killed by a truck while sweeping the dust-covered dirt street in front of the pool hall, Sonny returns to her for comfort.  This prompts the most truthful rendering of broken-hearted, pathetic rage, clashing with love-lost hopelessness and lingering tenderness that I've ever seen.<br /><br />  Oil wells keep on pumping and new wells are drilled, all the while raising the question, \\"what's the point?\\"  For the characters in \\"The Last Picture Show,\\" there is none.  The closest they get to happiness is sitting by a man-made pond, smoking hand-rolled cigarettes, reminiscing, and fishing for fish that aren't there.
B00008G7UJ|5.0|I wish this film had been about when I was first studying the play.  The acting is superb, the chemistry is excellent amongst the entire cast, the soundtrack stands on its own, and it goes without saying that the direction is superb.  Carelessly done, the contemporary backdrop could easily clutter the sonnets and iambic pentameter.  Luhrmann's vision to make the timeless story poignant is flawless.  DiCaprio and Danes deliver teenaged angst without being trite.  Perrineau is the best Mercutio imaginable.  I am ever moved by Danes' final scenes, certainly among those that put her on the map.
B002MW50KO|5.0|This Christmas album is awesome on many levels, but the main reason I love this album is that Dylan is really enjoying himself and you can hear it in his voice.    The contrast between the 40's style musical arrangements-- the clean voices of his back up singers-- and Dylan's jagged vocals is like opening a beautifully wrapped gift; you tear away the layers of ribbon and pretty paper and there in the box is something you really wanted: a cheerful Dylan singing it to you straight, as if you were one of his grandchildren.  Have a merry little Christmas, indeed!
B000V8I2QU|2.0|Poor mastering has been the form for many years but Magic takes it to new heights I'm afraid. Being a Bruce fan since his early days, I expected a high quality of songwriting but the fatiguing sound simply made the band sound so small and unsubstantial. The songs were struggling to get through. Overall I think there are quite a few good songs but nothing that compares with his best.
1423113497|1.0|These books were OK, but not the best books I've ever read.  You have to like mythology to enjoy these books.  The characters are not well developed  and seem to do do silly things that don't make sense.  Therefore, it's hard to empathize with the characters.  The concept is hard to believe because it is about  children fighting gods of greek mythology.
B002DKGWSE|4.0|See the other reviews for details about the movie.  I took the time to comment since the film was well developed.  They did logical things.  I hate it when someone you think is dead comes back to fight again. These characters when dead are dead! Every thing the good and the bad \\"guys\\" and gal did is what you would properly expect. For this reason I gave the film a high rating. Good acting, great story development and 4 or 5 flashes of T&A in the unrated verion to keep the guys wanting more...Sorry I had to say that, she was really cute, mean but cute.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I don't have much experience with different heat-sinks, so I'll just give my experience with my exact configuration.    I'm using a Core i5-750 with a GA-P55-UD3R motherboard and \\"Rosewill RCX-TC060 Thermal Compound\\". At stock speeds, under load, core-0 peaks at 48C-49C (room temperature: ~19C). Using 190MhZ base clock (x20 = 3800Mhz cpu, x10 = 1900Mhz memory), I saw it reach 61C once (58-59C more typically) under a Prime95 torture test.    Overall: seems like a decent heat-sink for around $30 and average use / moderate overclocking. I would assume there are much better heat sinks out there, but for $30....
B00169N0BK|3.0|(written after two months of use)<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />* Probably the most reasonably priced spectrophotometer on the market.  Colorimeters are cheaper, but inferior.<br /><br />* Extremely versatile in its ability to profile screens, projectors, printers and measure ambient light intensity in a single piece of hardware.<br /><br />* Color profiles produced are very accurate, even profiles I've made for one printer using aftermarket inks significantly different from OEM in gamut and intensity.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />* Design of hardware is stylish, but at the expense of being practical.  Rotating wheel can be difficult to turn and it is very easy to depress the button unintentionally.<br /><br />* Software too simplistic and not likely to change.  There are no true advanced options.  The only \\"advanced\\" mode exists in monitor profiles, where it will measure ambient light and adjust display intensity accordingly, in addition to the color profiling.<br /><br />I have a case where my printed photo profiles, while accurate, are too dark for intended viewing conditions.  There is no way to tell the software to use a different tonal curve or tweak anything else, such as ink density, when the profile is made.  As a result, I have to manually adjust every one of these images in photoshop before printing, which is a huge hassle.  Even after lightening in ps, sometimes images are still too dark.<br /><br />Note that this problem I have seems to vary with media type.  Some media profiles do not exhibit this problem at all; it appears to be most pronounced in coated glossy photo paper.<br /><br />I also fear X-Rite will never make the ColorMunki compatible with any of their more advanced software to prevent competition with their more expensive hardware.  After all, why would all but the most serious photographers spend 3x + more on the next step up profiling hardware for a small incremental improvement in the hardware itself?<br /><br />* Printer profiles can only be made on 8.5 x 11 or larger media due to the way it prints swatches for measurement.  If you have smaller media, such as 4x6, you need to purchase larger of the exact same paper to get an accurate profile.  Unfortunately, with media such as CDs, you're out of luck.  X-Rite should make media profiling more flexible in this regard.<br /><br />* Printer profiles have to be created one at a time, and the software cannot be closed during the process.  The printer profile process works as follows:  you print the initial set of swatches (will always be the same for any media or printer), give sufficient drying time, read the swatches with the ColorMunki, print a second set of swatches automatically generated and based on the results of the first scan (these swatches will vary depending on media, etc. and can have slight variations even using the same media, printer and initial swatch printing), allow sufficient dry time for the second set then finally read this second set with the ColorMunki.  The problem is if you are using media with very long dry times (or wish to provide long dry times) or need to profile many different types of media.  The initial set of swatches can all be printed in advance, with appropriate dry times given, but once the second set has been printed, closing the application will require you re-print the second set; your progress cannot be saved and resumed later.<br /><br />I suspect this was an intentional software design to prevent using this device for remote profiling, although anyone providing such services should be using high-end, professionally calibrated equipment.<br /><br />* A minor quibble, but the zipper on the cloth zippered case with the counterweight broke two weeks after purchase.  Since the case is somewhat necessary for monitor profiling (you can hold the device up to the screen, but must be careful not to press it on an LCD display).  The case should have a more durable design, such as Velcro flaps for the enclosure and rivetedhooks to attach the counterweight, rather than the (now broken) zipper.hooks to attach the counterweight, rather than the (now broken) zipper.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Here is Quentin Tarantino's big graphic gorgeous revisionist tribute to vengeance and filmmaking. Inglorious Basterds is made with the careful eye of a genius attuned to the delicate skill needed in creating such a film, yet who enjoys filling the screen to its edges with shamelessly unrestrained gore and historically audacious storytelling. It is primarily constructed from two subplots. One features Shosanna, a Jew living under false papers in 1944 Paris after her family was massacred. Then there is Aldo, played by Brad Pitt, a broadly-written American who is leading a cadre of underground Nazi-hunters. Both storylines are brought together (sort of) thanks to Col. Hans Landa, who is as skillful, intelligent, and passively terrifying as any villain I have ever seen.     Being a Tarantino film, however, the destination isn't half as fun as the journey, and this is some of his best work. Long, sonorous scenes follow one after the other, each a beautifully-crafted example of pause, dialogue, acting, and mise-en-scene. There is also an incredible sense of tension throughout- you continuously watch the film wanting the story to speed up while nervous about what is going to happen next. The end result is a big colorful mess, in the best way possible. Watch it and enjoy, but I wouldn't recommend eating beforehand.
B002E2QHBS|5.0|I'm pleasantly surprised yet not fully satisfied with this release. The sound quality and editing is much better than the original soundtrack or \\"25th Anniversary\\" editions.  I realize that it can't contain everthing without making it significantly larger and more expensive, but there are a few cuts from both editions that I miss (like the rain chant and a few other announcements in the original soundtrack and several great tracks included on the 25th anniv edition that were not included). I do feel that a \\"cream of the crop\\" sampling of the event has been well represented. Sad that Keef Hartley, The Band, & Ten Years After were not included, but I partly took care of that by combining tracks from the 25th anniv edition when ripping to my ipod. I was especially sad that there wasn't more Hendrix, in fact, the one track is the same as the original soundtrack.
B002Q9MZF6|5.0|If this version of La Boheme doen't move you or bring you to tears, I don't know what will. The atmosphere, the set, the actors, the singing... everything is perfect, breathtaking and tragic. Villazon continues to bring his charisma and tender charm to the world of opera lovers and Netrebko is at her tragic, immaculate best. The singing will soothe away the darkness.<br /><br />The DVD features the film version of Puccini's opera (directed by Robert Dornhelm) along with a Making of La Boheme and interviews with several of the cast members.<br /><br />I was highly impressed with the creativity involved. The four acts float by, fluid, flawless and there isn't one dull or trite moment. If anything, Dornhelm has helped to enhance some of the minor and least known elements of the opera, bringing more insight and colour to an already incredible piece of music. In previous versions of La Boheme I've seen, the minor characters always felt more 'minor' as as if the director simply wanted to focus on the tragic lovers whereas here, everything and everyone is essential. Dornhelm has a compassion directorial eye and I found myself moved even by the toy salesman and the people waiting at the gate in the cold.<br /><br />A must have. If you loved Gianfranco de Bosio's version of Puccini's Tosca this is another DVD to own, cherish and watch on a wintery night. Best enjoyed in the company of pizza, wine, french bread and good opera-loving friends.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I have to say as far as sound goes these blow my Sony 5.1 SRS AWAY.........far far AWAY.  For the price I have to say these are a steal for anyone in the market for Surround Sound. The design is very comfortable on the head and I felt no discomfort after long hours of use.  Cause they are headphones they are great to use if you don't want to disturb your partner, parents, or whatever.  The wireless is great BUT will interfere with ANY wireless router in range of it. I use it with my Xbox and had to switch from wireless to wired cause of the interference and drop signals on my Xbox.  The mic works great with the Xbox and PC.  You can hear everything clearly and you can also hear yourself so you know if your talking to low or to loud.  As I said before the sound is great, I haven't seen an other 7.1 headsets anywhere. Listen many people will try to tell you to buy Astro or another expensive brand cause of the name being associated with MLG (Major League Gaming) but I can tell you these have been tested against the other brands and wow.  As said there are no other 7.1 so I faced 5.1 headsets and for the same price the 7.1 is the way to go. Now there are some things I didn't like. The volume control is in an odd spot and when trying to turn the headset on (if it is already on your head) you might hit the volume at the same time and turn it really really loud.  The wireless is great as long as no WiFi is around.  Also I am disappoint that there is no wall adaptor, it powers by USB--in a way it is good to save wall space but that also means now it is stuck near my WiFi and I cannot move it so it has its pros and cons.  Overall I think it is a great set and should be on anybodies list who wants SRS 7.1 or any gamer list cause if you are a CoD fan you will be able to hear footsteps so clearly and be able to pin point where they are, you will even hear the enemy reloading from the top story of a build you are next to, it is just amazing.
B002E2M3KC|5.0|The sound quality is spectacular. A lot of the more subtle background instruments stand out a little more. It seems much clearer than even the CD releases. Great stuff for Queen-lovers and vinyl-lovers.
B002LK3DUQ|5.0|This is a movie that anyone can see without fear of scaring, embarrassing or offending  anyone. Great movie for any age group. I particularly enjoyed the relationship between the people and the animals. Can't say enough good things about this film.
B002IR3PQ4|3.0|Still not sure what the \\"2009 Digital Remaster\\" could really mean. It doesn't even mention it anywhere on the packaging itself. They sound pretty much the same. The vinyl reissues from the past two years sound better. Seven Seas Of Rhye seems a little clearer, but it could just be me. There also seems to be something different about the last gong crash at the end of Bohemian Rhapsody. It seems to be quieter or it fades out a little earlier or something.    If you want to start listening to Queen music, start with the albums! If you like their '80s sound, start with '80s albums like The Works or The Miracle and if you like their earlier sound, start with Queen II and Sheer Heart Attack. If you absolutely want only their greatest hits, do not start with Absolute Greatest.    The commentary was interesting, but still a lot of the same stuff Queen fans already know about and things they mentioned on the commentary to the video collections on DVD. The packaging leaves much to be desired. Even the plastic case seems flimsy and not the same quality as previous releases.
0743289684|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali's book, \\"Infidel\\" is a wonderful, horribly depressing, enlightening, thoughtful personal story of an incredibly courageous, brave, and intelligent woman. Ms. Ali's faith in herself, her self confidence are an inspiration to all. The hard questions which she raises must be answered by the world. This is a book which must be read by all who have inquiring minds who wish to consider politically incorrect thoughts and ideas.
0307269981|5.0|A friend told me about these books, apparently they have all been translated into Spanish first, and he had read them. I have to say that I am the type of reader that loves to get LOST in a GOOD book, so that means I can get so carried away I can't stop reading. I started reading this book sometime Saturday morning and finally got to the last page sometime around 4 a.m. Sunday. It is a great read, though I would definately suggest that one reads the Girl with the Dragon tatoo first. This book is good but the first one \\"the dragon tatoo \\"is better.<br />I would definately recommend these books, if you like a good detailed thriller. However to understand the protagonist Sulander alias the Wasp and Blomkzist you REALLY need to know what has happened before.<br /><br />A lot of the place names and first names are Swedish, so you have to make a rough guess at how they would be pronounced.<br /><br /> These books are thrillers but one should realise that there is an underlying truth within the books about domestic, verbal and psychological and sexual abuse/violence towards women throughout, something which I think is interesting as one gets carried into the book without often realizing that the book has been written to bring awarenees to these issues, and leaves the reader with not just the feeling of having read a good thriller, but also leaves you thinking about the statistics that are mentioned throughout the books chapters.<br /><br />I will be on the list when the next and final Steig Larsson comes out in English translation... sometime 2010.
1439138311|5.0|\\"Brooklyn\\" is an absolutely gorgeous piece of writing, my favorite of all Colm Toibin's books to date. I'll spare you having to read yet another synopsis of the story. Instead, I'll simply concur with what Zoe Heller, author of \\"Notes on a Scandal\\" and \\"The Believers\\" had to say about the book:<br /><br />  \\"Toibin writes about women more convincingly, I think, than any other living male novelist.\\"<br /><br />To which I'll add: and the great majority of women novelists, as well. Also, while some readers appeared to find the book slow reading, I couldn't put it down. If you're looking for action, for a fast, exciting pace, you won't find it here. On the other hand, if it's an interesting, insightful, sympathetic, and totally believable story you're looking for, with writing that is perfectly matched to the tale being told---where not a single word stands out as being unnecessary, show-offy, or in any other way inappropriate---you've come to the right place.<br /><br />In this book more than in any other of Toibin's estimable works, he demonstrates the fine art of putting one's ego aside and letting the story tell itself. He is truly The Master.
0812550706|5.0|Ender Game by Orson Scott Card is superb. At first glance this book might seem ordinary and unoriginal, but in fact the deeper you go the more you discover what an amazing book it pans out to be. The story of Enders Game revolves around an uncertain hero, Ender. Throughout the book constant pressure is forced upon Ender to be the weapon he was born to become. This genius commander is forced to face challenges no ordinary person could overcome, all for the sake of humanity.    I liked this sci-fi adventure for its deep sophisticated characters, its outrageous settings, and mind blowing action sequences. From the very start this book pulls you into the story, and makes you feel as if you were fighting alongside Ender.   Another character I want to mention is Bean. Bean was a soldier for Dragon Army and worked under Ender. They call him Bean either because it's his name or he's really small, I'm not sure which. Bean is just one of the many reasons why I can't help but continue reading this great novel.   General Graff uses his power to set in front of Ender difficult challenges, while his friends Petra, Bean, Molo, Soup, Vlad, and many others support him. Ender states time and time again he would be nowhere without the help of these people. Bean is the smallest of the group. He's a little hot headed and can be sort of arrogant at times but is still loyal to his commanding officer, Ender.   Ender lives a life that he is not in control of, saving people he doesn't know, all the while killing life when he isn't aware. He struggles to meet the expectations those people set around him, even though he excels above everyone else. I think the big idea of this story is just to do the best you can with what's around you.   The story in Enders Game begins with a boy who at the age of six enlists in the military. The setting of this story is in outer space, in the future. It follows Ender through years of military training, confinement from people around him, and being deprived ofany sense of support. This is necessary in order to make a suitable commander. Throughout most of his childhood he never escapes the grasp of the people controlling him, this was a sad reality. Even though he was a military genius, and grew around an environment most of us will never experience there were still some connection between normal people and ender.    If you ever want to find out what happened to Ender you'll just have to go out and pick up a copy of Enders Game. I would rate this book a 4/5 and would recommend it to just about anyone who enjoys and good read.
0385751893|5.0|I thought this story was well written.  It was an easy read, but provoked a lot of thoughts.  I would recommend.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This is a heart-warming excellent movie. Maybe not as inventive as Monsters Inc. or Wall-E but still highly entertaining. The Blu-Ray presentation is excellent and the set is packed with information. I loved Pete Doctor and gangs commentary.    I've never been a fan of the digital copy, though.
B002OB9KPE|4.0|At first listen, this is a bit familiar. There are familiar melodies of Spocks Beard and Neal Morse solo works. However, there is a new twist here and the melodies are memorable and pleasing with each additional listen. The guitar work is more heavy-pronounced and Portnoy spices it up even more with his complicated drum phrasing and for the better. There are some references to Yes' Fragile album but are pleasantly received and not overly done. Finally, there is a fair amount of fresh material and effect on this work. There are progressive surprises around every corner, something I have learned to expect from Mike and his group(s). Definately a strong buy.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Every episode totally blows my mind - not just once, but three or more per episode!  I had seen the pilot air, then missed the next three episodes before I re-engaged with the program.  I've been looking forward to getting this set for a long time.  The writing is superb.  The extras on the DVDs add so much; deleted scenes, producer's commentaries, etc. Spotting the Observer in the opening minutes of episode 3.  I must give a special tip of the hat to the superb performance John Noble gives as Dr. Walter Bishop.  I didn't recognize him until a friend pointed out that he had played Denethor, the Ruler of Gondor in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  And Anna Torv gets a nod for her down-to-earth, focused, all business portrayal of FBI Agent Olivia Dunham.

B0026P3G12|3.0|Susan Boyle has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard.  To hear her first performance on the Britain's Got Talent or whatever still gives me goosebumps.  It's thrilling.  You can hear and see the joy she is feeling.  This album has its share of beautiful songs - Wild Horses, I Dreamed a Dream, Cry Me a River and others.  I just didn't feel that she was singing with the same passion or joy that she had before.  Maybe all the agents and media folks have changed her too much.  She looks like a totally different person. And if you listen to the version of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" from this CD and compare it to her first televised performance, she sounds totally different.  I also question some of the song choices - I don't think Daydream Believer or You'll See are good songs for her.  If they would have stuck to more of the old classics like Cry Me a River or some other broadway show songs, I think it would have made a better package.
B0029LHW68|4.0|Ha, the simpletons whom are conservatives.  They never do their own research as they only listen to mouth pieces such as Beck, Coulter, Limbaugh, etc.  Please, Obama isn't even close to being a socialist and I should know as I am one.  He is just as tangled into the web of capitalism as all other politicians.  I must say... republicans: the party of small minds, not small government :)    Btw, Great Album!!!
B002P5XXR0|3.0|Preface:    James Horner... You either love him or hate him. The film score fan world is clearly divided between these 2 camps. I've never heard Horner described as just ok or average. Depending on who you ask, he's the greatest thing since sliced bread or the scum of the Earth. I'm a Horner fan. I think he has the rare ability to tell a story with his music and be able to evoke emotion with his music alone, not requiring a visual aid to accompany it. This is special. Such greats as Williams and Barry also have this rare ability and this puts James Horner in a select group. However, this is good James. Bad James shamelessly lifts parts from his prior scores and inserts them, sometimes note for note, into his new scores. He also has the tendency to lift parts of classical pieces and use them as well, almost note for note. The Horner fans are able to overlook this stuff because the purely original, new, and innovative parts of his scores more than make up for the already mentioned \\"Hornerisms\\".     The Review:    Avatar, while a solid and fitting score, does not live up to its potential. Scores are about giving a movie a unique musical identity. In this aspect it fails. Most of the themes and motifs presented can be clearly traced back to many prior Horner scores. I shouldn't have images of Glory, Willow, Titanic, The Four Feathers, etc in my head while I am watching Avatar. This can be really distracting to the viewer. If you aren't familiar with this prior material, then this score may rate higher with you. The main theme begins with the exact timing and first 3 notes of the love theme from Titanic. Even without considering the slight lift of the Titanic theme, this main recurring theme is one of the most underdeveloped themes Horner has ever put to a movie. It hardly qualifies as a theme. I guess this is where I can't support the self rips. Usually when lifting his own material he develops it further into something grander. Such is not the case here. Having a yearto develop this score, I ask... is this the best you can do?    While weak in themes and full of self rips, the Avatar score does have a bit going for it. The latter portions of the score have some top notch action music. Easily the scores highlight is the track \\"War\\". I'm a big fan of the choir in movie scores and Horner employs one in Avatar very effectively. What pulls this score from a 2 rating to a 3 rating are 2 things...orchestration and production/mixing. Avatar is hands down one of the better orchestrated scores you will find. This isn't surprising given Horner's orchestration talents as he did do some of the orchestrations on this score. What a lush score, using so much different instrumentation! For you Horner fans, this score contains just about every instrument he has ever used in his prior works. He even got an acoustic guitar strum in, identical to the one that opens \\"The Mask of Zorro\\". Synths and electronics can dominate at times but they are not a detriment and add welcome depth. Being a Cameron film, you know sound quality would be a big thing. This music delivers. I can't recall a score that just jumped from the speakers like this one does. Just running it in 2 speaker stereo and you will feel like you are immersed in the music.     So to wrap up, James Horner has written music for Avatar that undoubtedly fits the movie like a glove and will do its job. However, it just seems a bit uninspired and lazy in its composition. With really no movie music blockbusters over the last ten years, one has to wonder if Horner's tank has finally run out of gas. By all means buy this disc as there are enough positive things to justify the purchase. For those that are new to Horner, I would nudge you in the direction of \\"Legends of the Fall\\" or \\"Glory\\".
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I still remember how the old mono records sounded and this takes the purity and beauty of the originals to a whole other level.  I was amazed at the difference between the stereo and mono box sets.  The mono box takes it hands down.  The difference is hard to put into words but the clarity and the mix just sound like the old days and the stereo set sounds different to me.  Almost eardrum piercing cymbals on some of the songs and just too much separation that wasn't there even on the old stereo cd versions.  If I had bought the mono box set first I wouldn't have even bothered buying the stereo box but since I am a Beatle fanatic I had to have both!  I was disappointed to realize that had I waited until a couple of weeks before Christmas I could have saved forty dollars but I didn't want to take a chance on not being able to get a hold of it.  This is a purchase I will never regret. 5 stars x 10000000000000!!!!
B001KL3GY0|1.0|After Franz had droped off the radar for a few years, I was really excited there was a new album being released.<br /><br />Franz Ferdinand's first album was solid, original, and oozed with that nonchalant artschool coolness. Even their videos directly used post moderism in a qirky, \\"we're cool be we don't take ourselves too seriously,\\" way. It was both fresh and easy for anyone to identify with, and full of complex emotions, and bit cooly-intellectual. It seemed like there sound was just entitled to existance. I didn't feel like their second album was as good, but I was still on board.<br /><br />Before the album was released, I heard 'lucid dreams' and 'ulysses'. I believe there was a single for lucid dreams, it was a nearly four minute rock song. It expands their sound past \\"take me out\\" while still being everything I love about franz ferinand, maybe like the energy of \\"take me out\\" with the wistfulness of songs like \\"40'\\". Did this need to be made into a 8 minute remix for the cd? No, it didn't. Ulysses is probably the only other song off the album that give me hope these guys can still write captivating music, even if the premis of a guy getting board and getting high (the corus: \\"ulysses...la la lah\\") is a bit simple.<br /><br />I would say I found the second album to be a bit immature and underdeveloped at times, but still with some good ideas; apart from those two tracks on TONIGHT, Maybe the songs were well developed, but they were also unoriginal and uninspired. The hooks were all in the right places, but I felt like I'd heard them before. I felt kind of disgusted for buying the cd, if this was their first release I would have never listened to them. I was really excited too, so maybe I had my expectations up a bit. It was also really hyped about how much they expiremented, and rather than improving or expanding their sound it's like they lost it all together for something really mediocore.<br /><br />All bands need to find where their sound is going, I'mreally hopeing their next album will be better.

B001HY3BFE|4.0|Saxon are one of the first bands that fuelled my passion for listening to heavy metal music and  remain to this day one of my favourite bands, and 2009 sees the NWOBHM veterans release their latest album Into The Labyrinth.  How does their latest fare?  Well I like it a lot, but I also think it could have been better.<br />Battallions Of Steel is a great album opener in the Saxon tradition, with gothic type intro before it kicks into full pace, with killer riffs and Biff Byfords instantly recognisable voice.  It has a great melodic solo midway through, then it dies down and we get that gothic/anthemic type sound again before it kicks back into full blast.  Yes it's another battle song, but this type of song has become a trademark for Saxon, and perhaps only the great Iron Maiden can do war songs better.  This one ranks up there with their best.<br />Live To Rock follows, a song they released as a single which is very reminiscent of songs like Wheels Of Steel and Solid Ball Of Rock, with more of a hard rock/metal type sound than pure metal, but Saxon has always done this style justice and this song is no exception.  Simple, but I love it and you just can't help singing along with the chorus!  This is perfect for a live song to get the crowd singing.<br />Demon Sweeney Todd comes next, with a short mellow but eerie intro before it kicks into over drive.  A fast paced aggressive song with dark lyrics, a perfect balance of hard riffs and melody.  In fact it reminds me a lot of the songs on Unleash The Beast and is another album high-light.<br />Following on we get a short acoustic track The Letter which is really the into for the song to come Valley Of The Kings.  I love this song which sounds a bit more progressive in nature.  The intro, the fast paced verses with a slower, anthemic type chorus, and a great guitar solo which (together with the ancient Egypt theme & lyrics) reminds me of Iron Maiden.<br />Slow Lane Blues is next, perhaps the antithesis of their NWOBHM classic song Strong Arm Of The Law.  In that song Byford scoffs at the Police and their incompetence, but in Slow Lane Blues it's the law that has the last laugh with Byford singing about getting caught on a speed camera and having his car seized by the cops!  It's an ok song, but after the great songs that preceded it, the song just doesn't seem to hit the same high level.  However it's far better than the song that follows Crime Of Passion which can't be described as anything other than filler.  It's not a bad song, but really there's nothing that grabs you about it at all.  Pretty standard fare I'm afraid.<br />Premonition In D Minor is another short guitar track which is really the intro for the song which follows called Voice.  This song is all about the night Byford's house in France burned down and he was lucky to escape with his family alive.  Again, this song is ok, on the same level as Slow Lane Blues but not as good as the first four tracks.<br />Protect Yourself and Hellcat come next and like Crime Of Passion I think they are pure filler, but at least the album closes off on a high with a song as good as the first four in Come Rock Of Ages (The Circle Is Complete).  It's another more hard rock/metal type song with punch and a great melody.<br />Yes there's another song, but really it can only be considered a bonus track since it's an acoustic blues version of a previously recorded song Coming Home, and it doesn't fit in with the style of the rest of the album.<br />I have no criticism of the band's playing, they sound as good as ever.  However I do have a gripe sometimes with metal bands in that the vocals are sometimes too far back in the mix a bit, so you can't appreciate the talent of the singer as much as you would like.  I think that's the case on The Inner Sanctum too.  Byford's voice should be right out there, because it is his voice together with other original member Paul Quinn on guitar that makes the Saxon sound.<br /><br />So what we have hereis five top quality songs that can easily stand alongside any of Saxon's best work, two songs that are good, three fillers and a take it or leave it bonus track.  Plus a minor gripe about production.  Hence my view that it could have been better.  I just wish they had taken the time to write some more top quality songs which would have made for a more consistent album, and perhaps even a career best.  Maybe next time (let's hope!).sily stand alongside any of Saxon's best work, two songs that are good, three fillers and a take it or leave it bonus track.  Plus a minor gripe about production.  Hence my view that it could have been better.

0385737424|5.0|I'm not a very fast reader. The time I have to devote to reading for pleasure, is very limited. In between checking papers for school and planning lessons, working on various projects around the house, and planning for the arrival of our first baby, I'm lucky if I can squeeze in 20 minutes of reading a night. Or every other night! Suffice it to say, the phrases \\"page turner\\" and \\"couldn't put it down\\" when describing books, don't really apply to me, because whether I like it or not, I have to eventually put books down. It takes a rare, special book, to steal my attention and force me to set aside certain responsibilities in order to return to it frequently. I could tell from the opening pages of WHEN YOU REACH ME, that it was one special book.<br /><br />The setting is New York City. The time is 1979. Miranda, our narrator, is helping her mother prepare to be a contestant on the game show The $20,000 Pyramid. One day while walking home from school, Miranda's best friend Sal is punched by a stranger, once in the stomach and then once across the face, for no apparent reason. Sal hurries home without uttering a word to Miranda and their friendship, as she knows it, is suddenly over. Shortly after the incident, Miranda begins receiving mysterious notes from someone who seems to know more about Miranda's life than they ought to. Who is sending the notes? How do they know these things? And why Miranda?<br /><br />It's been a long time since I've read anything quite as enthralling as this book. I simply couldn't put it down. And I can't afford to use that phrase lightly. I would read a few pages or so, put it down to check papers, or plan lessons, or do some household chores, only to return to it minutes later to continue reading. Before I knew it, the day was getting shorter and I was past the point of no return. I finished the book that same day. From the opening page when Miranda's first person narrative breaks away to cryptically state \\"Just like you said\\", I was hooked. This was not just a story for us readers, this was a story being told to a certain someone. And the mystery of who that someone is sucks you in and pulls you along through the book.<br /><br />The story she's telling wouldn't be worth a thing to the reader if Miranda wasn't such a richly drawn character. She's endearing (there's times you want to let her cry on your shoulder) and she's imperfect (there's times you want to slap her across the face and shake some sense into her). She misses her best friend Sal and is trying her hardest to make new friends and fill the void. She befriends Annemarie and Colin, but is jealous of the budding romance between the two of them. She hates Julia but is forced to tolerate her because she's Annemarie's best friend. And she wants to hate Marcus because he's the boy who punched Sal for no apparent reason, but she can't help falling into conversations with him. All these conflicting dynamics add a certain level of authenticity to these characters and this setting, which only further strengthens the plot. These characters are all very real, and adults and kids alike will be able to connect with them.<br /><br />In order to keep up on my ever growing To-Read list, I don't often have the liberty of re-reading a text. Unless of course, it's something I find suitable for my 5th grade class at school, in which case, I use it as a classroom read aloud. WHEN YOU REACH ME is a book that just begs for multiple readings, so while my motives may have been a tad selfish, I just had to read it to my students. And I have to say, the book only gets better with a second reading! Having read it once and knowing what I now know, things stand out that went completely unnoticed the first time. Clever pieces of the puzzle are scattered throughout the text and I'm sure a third reading would reveal even more! Not a single sentence is wasted by author Rebecca Stead.<br /><br />This is a genre-busting book that defies classification. Is it realistic fiction? Is it historical fiction? Is it fantasy? Is it science fiction? It may be all of the above . . . with a little jealousy and romance and humor sprinkled in between. It's heartwarming, it's maddening, it's suspenseful, and it's a brilliant contribution to the world of children's literature. Hopefully, a book that will be loved and talked about for many years to come.asy? Is it science fiction?

B000002MTR|3.0|[3.5 stars]    Look, it's not the Chili Peppers' best album. And it's not really representative of their sound, so it's not the place to start for casual fans.     But it is their most interesting album, and definitely their darkest. The macho-but-harmless lyrics of 'Blood, Sugar..' have been replaced by more serious themes of depression, drug addiction, and death. The music, too, is much more ambitious than before, as new guitarist Dave Navarro adds a stronger metal and psychadelic feel to the album. There is also a surprisingly strong prog-rock influence here; several songs run over 6 minutes, and there are many tempo and mood shifts within songs. Good examples of the prog feel include 'One Big Mob' (Faith No More meets 'Mothers Milk' meets psychadelia) and 'Transcending' (softer song that explodes at the end).     Nearly every song tries something different. The driving heavy metal of 'Warped', the vaguely jazzy 'Walkabout', restrained ballads 'My Friends' and 'Tearjerker', Flea's solo piece 'Pea', the spoken-word intro to 'Deep Kick', the near noise-rock of 'Coffee Shop'. The darker lyrics also begin to incorporate more explicit social commentary, as on 'Pea' and the religious critique 'Shallow Be Thy Game'.     However, while their ambition is admirable, the execution doesn't always work. The band doesn't seem as tight as before, and some of the songs sound a bit stiff and forced. Perhaps the long and difficult sessions resulted in a lack of focus, perhaps the band weren't totally convinced about a change in direction, or maybe Navarro just wasn't a good fit for the band, but a few too many songs seem to lack the spark of 'Blood, Sugar...'. At 13 songs and 61 minutes, maybe they could have cut the album down a bit by leaving off one or two of the weaker tracks.     So, how you view 'One Hot Minute' depends on your attitude. If you want another 'Blood, Sugar...' or 'Californication' you can probably give this a miss. But if you're open to some new ideas, and arewilling to accept that not every experiment works, you might really enjoy this. It's probably a bit too inconsistent and unfocussed for my taste, but I do respect that fact that the Chili's were brave and ambitious enough to try to expand their sound.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. It's witty and charming. I think the screenplay is great. I loved the diversity of characters in the film. It always makes me laugh!
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Loved this movie so much  that I ended up buying one for a gift.
B002R0F3Q2|2.0|2,5 stars.<br /><br />I have to admit that these very positive reviews make me wonder, if they're written by die-hard fans, 'cause to me this sounds even weaker than \\"Who I Am\\", and that's just not a good thing. I've been listening to all of these songs on You Tube since November 6, and even though she still has a better sound than most modern R'n'B singers, she exhibits a worrisome tendency to gravitate toward the same shallow approach to her craft. I never in a million years expected this development, when Alicia first appeared on the scene. I really like her first album, it was very good and showed tons of promise, which she fully realised on her second album \\"The Diary Of Alicia Keys\\", which was nothing short of excellent - a masterpiece! I'm quite sad that the Alicia Keys that I loved is slowly but surely slipping away. Now, I wouldn't want an artist to stay the exact same on every release, but evolution's only a good thing, if it doesn't mean losing what was unique about the artist in the first place.<br /><br />Alicia doesn't seem to be as inspired as she used to be. Listen to the intro to \\"That's How Strong My Love Is\\", and then listen to Richard Marx's \\"Right Here Waiting\\". Notice the resemblance?<br /><br />Best tracks: \\"This Bed\\", \\"Empire State Of Mind\\".<br />Worst track: \\"Put It In A Love Song\\".<br /><br />I still have a lot of respect for this girl, she's a beautiful soul, and she's extremely talented, nobody can take that away from her. This is by no means a bad album as such. I guess it's alright compared to many other artists. Just don't expect that wonderful, warm sound of her first two releases.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|This is not your typical Sting.If you appreciate British and Celtic music you will appreciate this album.
B001F5M9MG|5.0|I recall seeing the MTV videos of Gimme all your lovin and Sharp Dressed Man and loved them so much i just had to get the album in the summer of 1983 and played the Eliminator album til it could play no more. The whole formula of their videos were the presence of the infamous 34 ford with their logo graced on the side and equally bodacious women coming out of it. Ok i am a car nut, but really the two mentioned tracks and legs are the whole thrust of the album with worthy mentions of \\"got me under pressure\\" and If I could only flag her down\\" as really cool tracks. Id get it again just for the pleasure of hearing it again.     Worthy picks if you like this one  Afterburner  ZZ Top live in Texas, there are some great live tracks of the hits from then.
1401923119|4.0|This is an excellent source for a description of the basics of cellular biology with an emphasis on the work of membranes. We get a beautiful analogy between cells and computers with DNA as the hard drive, the membrane as the keyboard, and the protoplasm as the rest of the computer. So when replacements are called for the DNA is the master copy but what the cell does with the \\"program\\" is dependent on what the environment does with the membrane. Since this involves cells during all stages of life including growth of a fetus we get an excellent vision of how important environment is for the growing fetus and the importance of mom's chemical interaction with the young person who is being designed for the environment. Some other wonderful explanation of the importance of stress-less-ness when the two functions are protection and growth. More protection less growth and vice versa. Depression? Protection against stress means less  growth of what the brain needs to think and do well. Trouble taking a test? Being afraid of taking a test makes you dumber. Finally, we branch into the spiritual side of things and this reminds me of the movie \\"What the Bleep Do We know?\\" But this is a balanced attempt at emphasizing the importance of positive thinking, understanding the energy side of the body and soul, and being aware that just positive thinking alone does not necessarily solve the problem. There is the issue of the placebo effect and the nocebo as well. In relationship to Complexity theory Lipton goes with the Fractal interrelationship of living things instead of the linear Newtonian view. This is a very readable treatment of an interesting subject.
B000P6XU5G|4.0|I don't yet own a lot of Blu-ray movies, but of the dozen or so I've watched, this is easily the worst.  The transfer seems very grainy and there was literally nothing in the image that seemed to me to be in any way an improvement on the DVD version.  So, if you already have the DVD version, I would see little point in buying this one.    With respect to the movie itself, like most other reviewers, I find this to be one of John Wayne's best films.  I would not, however, put it up there with the truly classic westerns because of the presence of Ricky Nelson.  In the latter part of Wayne's career, he apparently liked to include a young star in the film, presumably to appeal to younger filmgoers who might not have been attracted to an aging Duke.  I assume that this was a good box office strategy, and sometimes, as with Glenn Campbell's more than serviceable performance in \\"True Grit,\\" it didn't significantly damage the movie.  But not here.  Ricky Nelson is unbelievably bad.  Literally, the worst actor to ever appear in a major movie.  (He also managed to nearly capsize the otherwise excellent Jack Lemon film \\"The Wackiest Ship in the Army.\\")  It's not difficult to see why his film career came to an early end.  The problem with having a truly awful actor in a movie is that it makes it difficult to suspend disbelief.  You always end up being distracted by thoughts like, \\"Did Howard Hawks really believe he could coach a decent performance out of this stiff?\\"  There is a sharp contrast between Ricky Nelson and Dean Martin, who came to fame, of course, as a singer and straight man for Jerry Lewis. In this movie, Martin shows that he was an excellent actor.       If I'm allowed one more carp:  I think it would have been better to have cast a somewhat older actress in the Angie Dickinson part.  The age gap between Angie and the Duke makes their romance less plausible than it would have been with a more mature actress in the part.    The strength of the performances by Wayne, Martin, and Walter Brennan, and the brilliance of the script are enough to overcome these problems, though, and make this an enjoyable film.  One that is, of course, indispensable for John Wayne fans.
B002R0F3Q2|4.0|On Alicia Key's fourth studio release (fifth album overall), [[ASIN:B002R0F3Q2 The Element of Freedom]], Alicia Keys continues the experimentation into more pop-centric ideas, much like 2007's [[ASIN:B000VEYJP2 As I Am]].  Like the results on that effort, some songs are exceptional and push Keys's artistry even further  while others prove more flawed.  However, just like on AS I AM or even the 'fluffier' material from [[ASIN:B0000DD7LC The Diary of Alicia Keys]] or her debut [[ASIN:B00005JXS6 Songs in A Minor]],  Keys makes even the least interesting track more interesting than it should be, a reflection on her artistry.  'The Element of Freedom', I won't lie, isn't my favorite Keys album, though I don't any will ever supersede the exceptional 'Diary of Alicia Keys', however, it is another worthwhile contribution to R&B/Pop music and to Keys's personal discography that has given musical fans such a gift to listen to.<br /><br />After the introduction, her shortest to date and sans piano and production work,  Keys barrels into one of the most adventurous and best songs on the album, the exceptional \\"Love Is Blind\\".  \\"Love is Blind\\" has a sort of reggae feel, giving it a different sound than anything Keys has released.  The production work is great and Keys sounds quite inspired on this track.  It matches the greatness of previous starters such as \\"Go Ahead\\", even if it may only hint at the greatness of classics \\"Karma\\" or \\"Girlfriend\\".  \\"Love Is Blind\\" is an instant favorite for me.<br /><br />\\"Doesn't Mean Anything\\" has suffered from the criticism that it copycat's 2007's ubiquitous \\"No One\\" with its piano-centric production and thumping 4/4 drum pattern.  True, it doesn't quite garner the classicism exhibited by \\"No One\\" and Keys seems slightly reserved towards the end of this track  (I would have like to heard her stretch her prodigious pipes slightly further), but it is still well rounded and catchy. Something about it despite being slightly flawed in comparison to earlier debut singles, still makes it endearing to Keys fans.  Maybe its the fact that she's slightly under pitch during the chorus that makes the performance feel genuine and raw despite a lack of vocal aerobics here.<br /><br />\\"Try Sleeping With A Broken Heart\\" also shows a different vein of Keys than fans have seen before.  She is incredibly subtle on this track, given off this effect of hurting from love, which bodes well in the favor of this second single.  Revolutionary? No, but enjoyable and the hard-drums only add fuel to fire!  \\"Wait Til You See My Smile\\" is a more pop-oriented track, contrasting the first couple of tracks.  It isn't my favorite track, but it is quite enjoyable and pleasant.  Again, the production work is experimental and always Keys sounds fantastic.  The background vocals lay very well here too.<br /><br />\\"That's How Strong My Love Is\\" proves to be a strong track that makes enough concessions to pop music without leaving Keys's soul-laden roots. There is an overt genuineness that is written all over this track, even more evident as the track builds up.  Keys sounds quite inspired here.  \\"Unthinkable (I'm Ready)\\" instantly adds a groove after \\"That's How Strong My Love Is\\" lacked drums.  Here, Keys begins singing sultrily in her lower register, a nice contrast from previous numbers.  A standout, \\"Un-Thinkable (I'm Ready)\\" is well produced with sparse piano work, energized vocals from Keys, and top notch songwriting.<br /><br />\\"Love is My Disease\\" reminds one instantly of \\"No One\\" as far as Key's overt, raw vocal technique.  Again, the track transcends Keys's neo-soul tracks in favor of pop mixed with reggae, but Keys sounds soulful as always, neo- or modern soul.  \\"Like The Sea\\" is one of my favorites, finding Keys borrowing the piano part from Claude Debussy's famous \\"Arabesques\\" (No. 1 believe).  Easily one of the most soulful numbers, \\"LIke The Sea\\" sounds as if it could have appeared on Alicia Key's 'The Diary of Alicia Keys', hearkening back to her glory days.<br /><br />The biggest departure is the more hip-hop based \\"Put It In A Love Song\\",  a duet with Beyonc&eacute;, which proves shocking to fans but also is perhaps one of the most triumphant tracks from 'The Element of Freedom'.  Both divas are a class act on this fine track, blending with each other well (considering a juxtaposition of R&B styles).  The production is excellent and the songwriting cutting edge by all means.  Another interesting cut is \\"This Bed\\", which hearkens back to 1980s R&B with drums hearkening back to the \\"boxy\\" sound that drum programming possessed at the time.  It proves as enjoyable as anything else.<br /><br />\\"Distance and Time\\" returns Keys to a ballad format, with understated, though haunting production work.  As always, Keys does well with sensitive numbers. The ending is especially great, with the allusions to \\"No One\\" obvious.  \\"How It Feels To Fly\\" also has a soulful-pop feel, no so far removed from something that Leona Lewis might sing from [[ASIN:B002DYJAI4 ECHO]].  Final cut \\"Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down\\" is Keys's take on her #1 hit with Jay-Z.  It doesn't trump the original, but it a solid, worthwhile affair nonetheless.<br /><br />Essentially, 'Element of Freedom' is a solid R&B album that transcends soul, pop, and adult contemporary styles. It isn't Keys best, I reiterate, but as always, Keys is consistent and never makes a bad album.  I would love to hear her next album return back to some of the more overtly soulful tracks, like those that appeared on 'The Diary of Alicia Keys', my favorite Alicia Keys album and one of my all-time favorite albums.

0307454541|5.0|As with many translations, the unfamiliar, unpronounceable proper names interrupt the flow of the prose.  For example, the main character's name in this Swedish novel is Blomkvist, which doesn't exactly roll smoothly off my English-speaking tongue.  His female business partner and frequent lover is often referred to by her last name of Berger, but there is also a male character whose first name is Birger.  The names of places are even more inscrutable.  Still, the storyline is quite addictive, although it becomes somewhat gruesome and less engrossing in the second half.  It's a good, old-fashioned mystery that reads like it was inspired by Dashiell Hammett.  It also reminded me of the game of Clue, because the crime was committed on an unreachable island with a limited group of suspects.  Blomkvist is a journalist whose reputation has been tarnished by a conviction for libel.  Eighty-something-year-old Henrik Vanger has hired Blomkvist during his self-imposed sabbatical to investigate the disappearance of Harriett, his brother's granddaughter.  The plot also made me think of the movie Blow-Up, because a photo becomes key to the investigation.  Blomkvist hires Lisbeth Salander, an anti-social computer hacker with a photographic memory, as his assistant.  Lisbeth has skeletons in her own closet and a personal vendetta against men who abuse women.  In my imagination, she looks like the main character in the movie Run, Lola, Run.  Perhaps this is part of the reason that this book is so popular; it conjures up striking visuals of the characters and the chilly Nordic landscape.  Plus, there are enough evil characters--former Nazis, rapists, corporate sleazeballs, etc.--to fill several novels.
B002VPE1AM|1.0|Here we have James Cameron's new film; chock full of CGI, boring action and....well, that's it, really, nothing else at all.<br /><br />So, a group of human soldiers invade a foreign planet, and the residents are peeved; so, it's Starship Troopers, but without any intelligent satire or....anything really.<br /><br />Don't give me this \\"movies are supposed to entertain\\" argument either; that's only one part of the role of a film, but Cameron isn't aware of this; from his days under Roger Corman (where he should have stayed) to his newest 11 year old boy's wet dream he's proved this.<br /><br />I end the review with a quote, on Cameron, by a man who understands cinema in its totality:<br /><br />\\"Cameron isn't evil, he's not an a-hole like Spielberg. He wants to be the new De Mille. Unfortunately, he can't direct his way out of a paper bag.\\"
B002N5N5M0|5.0|If fans loved the first season of Dexter and had negative feelings about Seasons 2 & 3, then Season 4 will not disappoint.    Emmy nominee Michael C. Hall returns as Dearly Devoted Daddy Dexter, who now lives with wife Rita (Julie Benz) and three kids in their new suburban home complete with pool, and some nosy neighbors who make Dexter's life miserable. As all this goes on, Dexter arrives at a crime scene where a woman is found in a bathtub covered in a pool of blood. There he finds that Special Agent Lundy has come back with the idea that this same crime happened 30 years ago in Miami and in several cities around the country. Lundy calls him the Trinity Killer. Later two more bodies are found, a mother committing suicide and a man bludgeoned at a bar, both homicides connected to Trinity. When Deborah becomes very involved publicly to the case, Dexter discovers the identity of Trinity to be a man named Arthur Mitchell (John Lithgow) who has a family of his own.    Dexter gets to know Arthur better in order to learn how he can keep the secret of his dark passenger and his family intact. This proves more difficult the further Dexter goes into Arthur's life until Dexter finally decides to make his move and get Arthur on his table.    A few subplots abound in this season as well. La Guerta and Batista have a romantic relationship, Quinn begins sleeping with a local reporter intending to get more out of him than certain parts, and Deborah continues to look into Harry's C.I.'s to find out who he slept with.    December 13th ended on a rather shocking note (which I won't say) and there are many great episodes to watch here. To name a few: The Getaway, Hello, Dexter Morgan, Hungry Man, and Dirty Harry. John Lithgow as Arthur Miller/Trinity has given us a performance that may outrank The Ice Truck Killer in Season 1. The role has also given Lithgow a Golden Globe and possibly an Emmy nomination later for his role as the serial killer. This season is definitely a must see for any fan of the show or for those who haven't seen the other seasons.

B001HNE3NO|2.0|I was really excited to read this book after hearing a brief description of it. I finally got to it and was disappointed. I thought it started out well and had a lot of possibility. However, I was bored during the chapters where Sarah is not the primary focus. The big mystery, what happened to Sarah's brother, is revealed too early in the book in my opinion. I really enjoy books that have an unanticipated twist at the end but this book lacked that. There was no twist, no climax of events/research. I was very dissappointed in the ending. It was okay.
B0026OE2NY|5.0|True, there are a couple of obvious mistakes in the narration. I think everyone is well aware that cities have been around longer than 600 years and most people probably know that the Grand Canyon is not in Colorado. Duh. That said, this is still a beautifully filmed image of earth. Not just the splendors but also the blemishes and yes, humanity is responsible for those blemishes.  While most nature films show beautiful images with the occasional bits of carnivores in action. This film shows the earth as it is now and man's role in its current state. There are three reasons so many people are offended by that. Some just don't care about future generations and the earth they will inherit. They are unaffected by problems that don't directly affect them or their bank account. Some people object to \\"propaganda\\" like this film on the grounds that measures to control pollution and global warming are meaningless since God will provide a new earth long before we destroy this one. But most of the people who are offended by all this talk of social responsibility to the earth do so on the supposed grounds that the earth is indestructible. And these people will not be convinced otherwise until destruction is an imminent threat.  You could point out that there are far more people and far more cars and far more coal burning powerplants that ever before in earth's history. You could point out that there is far less forest land and far less polar ice and far more money to be made exploiting the earth's resources. But deaf ears are deaf ears.  The companion book, Earth From Above, is equally beautiful and informative. While it is depressing to know that so many people are so oblivious and irresponsible, it is heartening to know that enough people care enough to make this film and to appreciate it.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Who would've thought that Will Ferrell, Saturday Night Live alumni, would be the one to create a new Christmas classic? Thanks to the wide-eyed silliness of Ferrell, the deftly smart direction of Jon Favreau, and a cleverly funny & heartfelt script, \\"Elf\\" turns out to be a real delight. In a decade awash with disappointing Holiday films, this one truly earns the title of \\"brand new Holiday classic\\".   And the whole cast is good: James Caan as Buddy the Elf's gruff, cynical father who's lost touch with his true spirit; Mary Steenburgen gives solid support as Caan's wife; Bob Newhart lends his dour, low-key presence as Head Elf; Zooey Deschanel as Buddy's love interest, a rather cynical & untrusting department store worker; and Ed Asner as a sort of world-weary Santa. But ultimately, this is Ferrell's movie all the way, as his sweetly innocent but comical Buddy navigates his way through the gritty jungle of New York City, and eventually succeeds in re-connecting the town with its lost Holiday spirit.   Both an engaging tale & a charming satire of Christmas movies, \\"Elf\\" is definitely one of my favorites to watch around Christmastime!
0783231202|4.0|Amistad tells the story of an African group illegally captured and sold into slavery during the years following the dissolution of the international slave trade. This particular group was highly unusual in that it actually managed to break free of its chains, overthrow those in charge of the ship, and order that it be returned to Africa. Unfortunately for the Africans, they are the victims of deception once again, as the ship is sailed into American shores instead. It lands near Long Island, and the Africans are immediately arrested and taken to Connecticut, where their fate is to be determined from within the legal system. Their case passes through various different courts, but they are successful at every turn; along the way, they receive assistance from various legal and linguistic aides, abolitionists, and even ex-President John Quincy Adams. Their freedom is eventually upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, and they are sent back home to Africa. I rather enjoyed the film, finding it to be a harrowing, emotionally engaging, and surprisingly accurate historical drama.     The film was released in 1997, produced by Debbie Allen and Steven Spielberg, and distributed by DreamWorks. Steven Spielberg is the director; Djimon Hounsou, Anthony Hopkins, Matthew McConaughey, and Morgan Freeman, among others, are the stars. As previously stated, it is a historical drama based on actual events; according to the interviews with the director and stars included on the DVD, much attention was paid to making it as accurate and true-to-life as possible. Of course, it is also a Hollywood film, and therefore a dramatization; to this end, it includes elements of suspense, action, and other traditional Hollywood trappings. As such, it was designed to appeal both to fans of serious historical dramas and to more general moviegoers.      On account of the factors just mentioned, the film does manage to be entertaining, despite its serious overtones and devotion to historical accuracy. It manages to hold one's attention throughout, even though it is longer than the average film and deals with more complex and less conventionally appealing subject matter. Elements of both pedagogy and entertainment are present in the film, and neither, thankfully, ever manages to get in the way of the other. Even so, it becomes clear upon viewing the aforementioned interviews, and indeed the film itself, that a key underlying them for Spielberg and his cohorts was depicting a relatively unknown incident in American history as accurately and sympathetically as possible within the confines of a Hollywood film. Proof of this exists in the attention to detail present in, for example, the choice of sets and the painstaking depiction of language.      Amistad depicts several cultures and subcultures. For example, although fleetingly, it shows glimpses of African tribal culture during the flashback scenes in which Cinqué, the tribal leader, reflects back upon his life at home before he was captured. More significantly, it portrays, in graphic and nearly excruciating detail, what it may have been like to be a prisoner onboard a slave ship. Spielberg refuses to flinch with these scenes, choosing instead to depict them with an intensity that ranges from moving to horrifying. Knowing, as the audience does, that the Africans memorialized in the film were unusual in that their experience was less trying than most others only serves to reinforce the truly ghastly horrors of the slave trade. Although elements of these scenes are inevitably based on conjecture, they are notable for their striking apparent realism; for the viewer to see fellow human beings treated in such a savage and inhumane manner truly serves to set the Africans up as genuinely human and wholly sympathetic characters. As Roger Ebert notes, this is one of the primary strengths of the film:  \\"What is most valuable about \\"Amistad\\" is the way it provides faces and names for its African characters, whom the movies so often make into faceless victims.\\" Not surprisingly, the film casts these Africans in an extremely positive light; they are shown to be an essentially innocent people, with a legitimate and vibrant culture of their own, who are unfairly and tragically captured and sold into slavery for no real or just reason. Few viewers, one assumes, will disagree with this presentation - on the basis of either history or the film. That said, Amistad does depict a darker side of the Africans; the dramatic insurrection scene that opens the film, for example, shows them to be quite brutal and uncompromising in their takeover of the ship, however justified such an overthrow may have been. It leaves the task of deciding whether or not this is morally right up to the viewer; it passes no judgments of its own. More significantly, it shows one undeniable but rarely mentioned fact of the slave trade; Europeans could not have undertaken it without help from Africans. The sad reality of this unfortunate state of affairs is made dramatically clear during the scene in which Cinqué is captured by rival Africans and handed over to slavers. These Africans, then, are portrayed both as the centerpiece of a dominant culture in their native area of Africa and as a subculture - that of imported slaves - in America.     The film also portrays American culture, or at least part of it, as it stood in 1840. It shows little of how everyday people lived or of what constitued popular culture at the time - but this, of course, is not the focus of the movie. What it does show, and in surprisingly vivid detail, is what it may have been like to live in America circa 1840. This is accomplished via the highly detailed and very realistic sets that are featured throughout the film. In contrast to the Africans, American society is depicted very ambivalently; one could even argue, quite plausibly, that it is cast in a generally negative light. For example, it shows American politics to be largely corrupt. Thus, PresidentVan Buren is shown as a bumbling fool completely lacking in all moral integrity who cares only about being re-elected; this image is even further reinforced when the film has him illegally and unconscionably interfere with the trial by using his political clout to replace the judge with one he believes will be his crony. The film also emphasizes the evils of slavery, which still existed in the country at the time, thereby taking another shot at 1840 American society. Even so, it does show some bright spots in the nation, such as the abolitionist movement and the existence of at least one incorruptible politician in the person of John Quincy Adams. On the whole, though, it can be unequivocally said that the allegedly superior American culture is contrasted throughout the film with African culture, and the latter generally comes across as less arrogant and hypocritical.      This last discussion touches upon several of the film's other major themes - political corruption, the role of slavery in American society and national economy, lingering differences between the North and South, etc. The main theme of the movie, though, is undoubtedly freedom. It argues, very powerfully and convincingly, that freedom is a natural right; thus, it uses the very moving and illustrative saga of the captured Africans to make a philosophical point that, at film's end, few would be willing to refute. All of the film's underlying themes are brought to bear on this one central point, and it manages to perform the difficult task of arguing its case quite well without ever becoming overly didactic.     I was impressed with the film and found viewing it an enjoyable and worthwhile experience. It is very well done overall and contains a wealth of fine acting, cinematography, and storytelling. Amistad is truly one of those rare films that is both entertaining and informative; in this, it clearly accomplishes its goal of being a significant and meaningful film without sacrificing popular appeal. It comes highly recommended for anyone who enjoys historical dramas or wants to learn more about the issues explored in the film without having to resort to a scholarly resource. Due to the film's admirable historical accuracy, much can be gleaned from it about both the slavery issue and 1840 American society and culture. Anyone who seeks knowledge in these areas, or simply wishes to enjoy a good film, will find Amistad engaging and thoroughly valuable.
B001AVCFK6|4.0|The original series nearly always depicted 'humanity\\" in a positive way, still learning and hopeful. What a concept.    This \\"New\\" crew has that same potential yet uses far more in the way of special effects to raise the obsession for \\"Wow\\" desired by today's theater audiences. BTW, the effects are spectacular, somewhat overdone than necessary, but that sells tickets to potential new fans of this venerable series.    J.J. Abrams and crew tried and accomplished to save the \\"canons' as they adhered to in the film and in the extras disk. A very good thing to keep fans like myself happy as straying far afield would have been less than satisfactory. I found the \\"extras\\" disk to be as entertaining as any I have seen in quite some time.     The new/old crew, for the most part, did a wonderful job. Casting was nearly impeccable. My only slight gripe was the writing for Dr. McCoy. A tad over the top, but I may be alone in this assessment. As the characters/actors have time to meld into a cohesive unit, they could become as popular as any Star Trek iteration to date.     On the technical side, the BD disk is impeccable. Saturated with just enough color, the use of real film does help, The inky blacks are portrayed well on a display capable of handling them. The sound effects and score fit the image, especially with a properly calibrated system. It is probably better at home than in most theater's. At least those I sometimes frequent with their blown drivers and indiscriminate setups.    I enjoyed the film and I'm of the age to remember waiting for the evenings when the original series ran. For new viewers of Star Trek, you shouldn't be disappointed by having a copy of this in your film library.    d6500k

B002H3F7F6|4.0|It took a little while to grow on me, but I do really like this CD. Songs 1, 2 and 5 are my favorites. I like to listen to this while driving, especially when it's snowing!
B002QEXN2K|5.0|First off I would like to put it out there that I have always been a John Mayer fan., and I have all of his cd's (studio and live).  Mostly, I think this comes from how much I relate with him and the words/meaning that comes of his music. We are about the same age, and from what I can tell we have been through the same obstacles in life.  Each time I put in a Mayer cd, it takes me back to a place in my past. Positive or negative it always brings on a great feeling.     Anyways, with that being said.....this is the BEST cd yet! I debated buying the cd at first because I wasn't sure what to expect.  I came on Amazon to read some reviews.  In the end I purchased the cd (did not rip it off or copy from a friend because Musicians deserve the money from all of the time and energy that is put into making a record), and for the past three weeks I CAN NOT STOP LISTENING!  Even my girlfriend who previously had not listened to much Mayer, can't bring herself to take it out of her car cd player.      Someone on here wrote a review with something to effect of  - \\"Never has my car ride home from work been so peaceful.  Even if I had the worst day ever, I forget about all of that when listening to \\"Battle Studies\\" on the way home.\\"  So true.      Highly recommended. Keep on keeping on John!      Jeremy
B002MRRRAA|4.0|For the record, I love Nirvana. I grew up with that band, so naturally, when I heard about the famous convert from 1992 was going to be released on DVD, I knew I was going to buy a copy, no questions asked. Now, the DVD is amazing, though there are a few problems that I've noticed. Mind you, they may not matter to some people, but for me, I feel as if I need to address them.<br /><br />1. The camera seems to move around a lot. That may not seem like a big problem, because you want to see the entire band members rock out, but it moves too much throughout the entire concert, which gets quite annoying.<br />2. There's no indication of which song is being played next. I know all of the Nirvana songs, but I just think it would have been nice to let the viewers know which song is coming up next.<br />3. Songs transition is way too fast, there's no pause in between songs. They go right into the next song way to fast, which makes it feel as if they were rushing. I like when a band interacts with the crowd, so it enhances the experience.<br />4. There's not much interaction with the crowed. I love going to concerts, and when the band interacts with the crowed, whether it's talking to us, or going into the crowd while still performing, I think it makes the concert more enjoyable.<br /><br />Overall, this DVD is a must-have for Nirvana fans. While there are a few shortcomings, which aren't that much of a problem, this DVD will feed every Nirvana fan.<br /><br />What are you waiting for? Stop reading this review, and purchase a copy!
0618526412|3.0|This story is set in the 1930's .The main character is John Singer a deaf - mute and the people around him for which he is a sounding board even though he cannot hear them.<br /><br />This book to me was depressing it does not have a happy ending or for that matter a happy beginning or middle. There is no action it is a character study. I understand that Miss. McCullers published this book when she was just 23 years old and for that reason I do see somewhat what all the hype is on this book because it is well written hence the 3 stars. But for me I did not enjoy this book, it depressed me and confused me. I felt the climax *no spoilers* was extremely anti-climatic. So much in this book was not explained and left me wondering and not in a good way about the reasons people did things. Over all a well written book but not one I would recommend or read again.
0451450523|5.0|One of the best fantasy books of all time -- don't let the subject matter fool you; this book is as enjoyable for an adult as for a kid. Even moreso, perhaps, because an adult reader will pick up on the subtleties -- themes of hope, despair, of the endurance of mystery and fantasy in the world, of what it means to be noble and heroic, or how to find one's place in the world -- and a few touches of truly wonderful metatheatricality. So very highly recommended.
0143034901|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The mystery of it all, wondering about this mysterious author Carax right along with Daniel. The characters in this book are just wonderful from all the main characters to the characters like the dirty old man in the \\"asylum/old folk's home\\", characters that have a way of staying with you. The character of Fumero was such a creep/psychopath talk about holding a grudge.<br />I enjoy books about books and this one was no exception. It is historical fiction in my mind although it is set in the 20th century.<br />If you enjoyed People of the Book I think you'll like this one too even though they are very different they have a similar \\"feel\\".
0307346617|5.0|To start with, I'm not into zombies. I feel like it's important for me to note that, so y'all know what kind of person this review is coming from. I'm not a person who watches zombie movies or reads zombie books most of the time. The only zombie movie I've seen start-to-finish is Shaun of the Dead. It's just a genre I've just never gotten into -- probably because I don't like horror/slasher/things of that ilk in general. But I read this book on recommendation from my boyfriend (who *is* into zombies), and I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />It's excellent. I mean, really well done, which is part of why I found it so unsettling. Brooks does an amazing job at crafting so many unique voices, and the way the stories are told, well, it's really easy to imagine this as an actual documentary effort, not fiction. Since it's written as a retrospective, however, you know that everyone whose story you hear makes it through. Otherwise they wouldn't be telling the story. So you don't get attached to characters only to have them die in horrific ways or turn evil on you. World War Z has a few wretched types, but mostly it's stories of people who survived because they fought like hell, and I like that kind of story. It might take a bit of the suspense out, but for a reader who isn't looking for that, it probably won't bother you a bit.
B001FB55I0|3.0|Buy or rent? Buy or rent? What to do...what to do? Well, here's a word of advice: If you're like me and you want to see the Director's Cut (the R version) versus the Theatrical PG-13 version, buy this. Because I first rented it from Netflix, but Netflix is sending out a Blu Ray version that's PG-13. I found this especially odd because I can't find a Blu Ray version for sale that's PG-13. So how and why is it that Netflix's Blu Ray version of Terminator Salvation is PG-13?<br /><br />Am I sure? Yes, I'm sure. There is no mention of Director's Cut on the Netflix sleeve or the disc itself. The disc did indeed say Blu Ray. And right before the movie starts it says rated PG-13 by the MPAA. But the solid evidence came from watching the Netflix version and finding that there was none of the Director's Cut extra's so perfectly outlined in Senor Zoidbergo's lead customer review on the Amazon front page for this product.<br /><br />Regardless of whether you get the Director's Cut or have to settle for the Theatrical version, you're in for an average movie viewing experience at best. I was certainly entertained. I love the Terminator movies...especially T1 and T2. I know a lot folks hated T3; I for one did not hate T3. T3 was not up to par with 1 & 2, but it wasn't as awful as all the pile-ons make it sound. No, I think that Terminator Salvation and T3 are equally average...in their own unique ways.<br /><br />And I'll tell ya, it was hard watching Salvation and not thinking about that tirade that Christian Bale went on during the filming of this movie? Have you heard that? Oh my God, what a chump. Sam Worthington stole this movie from Bale; Worthington's performance in Salvation may even get me to get out to the theater to see Avatar and next year's remake of [[ASIN:B00005JKO7 Clash of the Titans]]. Gotta give props to Anton Yelchin as a young Kyle Reese too; Yelchin almost made me think he was really a young Michael Biehn (the guy who played Reese in the original [[ASIN:B000F9RB9Y Terminator]].<br /><br />But the story in Salvation didn't come close to living up to what Terminator or [[ASIN:B001RIY4WE Terminator 2:]] delivered. Salvation's story is by far not put together as well as its inspirations, and many of the scenes are just over the top no-way situations. How did teen-pop TV Producer McG land the director's chair for such a coveted franchise as the Terminator series? Maybe he didn't teeny-bop Salvation, but it was very weeknight CW networked up.<br /><br />Bottom line: Terminator Salvation is a rental, but if you rent it at least be sure that you're getting the Director's Cut. One way to be sure that you get the Director's Cut is to add this now to your Amazon cart. Buy or rent? Buy or rent?

B002R0F3Q2|2.0|...is what a Washington Post reviewer called her and it's true.     There's a lot to like about Alicia Keys: She's a terrific person giving both money and time to several causes; she's classy - you'll never confuse her with Lil Kim.     But, let's be honest, her music is just MOR pap. We'd like to be astonished whenever we pick up a Keys cd, but really, all we ever get is 9 or 10 of the same slickly-produced piano ballads that you get on every single cd from her.     In a way, she's a female 50 Cent. Just like 50 poses as a gangsta but is really only interested in selling watered-down hip hop to suburban 15-year olds, so too does Keys' record company and management push her as an \\"innovative\\" and \\"dynamic\\" artist just because she plays the piano. But their primary role for her is that, with her model good looks, she's someone who can produce \\"soul music\\" that's suitable and non-threatening to the soccer-mom demographic.     Keys loves to name drop Prince, Stevie Wonder and Nina Simone as influences but let's be real: she's a lot closer to Toni Braxton or Leona Lewis.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|Great flash, and my second entry into the Nikon CLS system.<br /><br />I needed something to work wirelessly with my D200 using the commander mode (remember to also purchase the [[ASIN:B000E1G0LI Nikon SG-31R IR Panel for Built-in Flash Repl - Nikon 4905]] to mount over your built in flash so you can wirelessly trigger the remote flash), something with a bit reach, and FAST recharge time.<br /><br />For a naive user, the SB900's menus are a GOD sent - easy, quick, intuitive, the way it should've been.<br /><br />There is some buzz on the web that early adopters had flashes that overheated and would shut down during events. . .how to combat the problem? Use [[ASIN:B000IV0REA Sanyo Eneloop 4 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargable Batteries w/ Charger]], or get the battery pack for the SB900, which attaches with a wire and reduces recharge time and disperses heat better.<br /><br />I personally have never had a problem with my SB900 recycling fast and overheating.<br /><br />Looking forward to Nikon updating the SB600 with this user interface!<br /><br />Worth buying.
B002T9H2LK|2.0|Wow, Gee... Inglourious Basterds<br />I've finally come to believe, sadly, at long last, that Quinton Tarantino is no cinema genius. And I had such high hopes.<br /> Tarantino just loves films. This film has many, many, many, many references to scenes from other films or film genres and in this case, that's unfortunately more curious than interesting.<br />  The film buff I me is self-congratulatory for recognizing what he is doing until I realize that it is killing continuity and any semblance of plot. Plus that's all there is. He has no film. No script. Just a Multi-Million dollar actor, Brad Pitt.<br />Pretty soon into the film I note that I am watching a derivatively stupid film. There is really no creativity, no original film making... but a mad-cap director that says with unbridled enthusiasm (boy-like), \\"Wow, lets put this into the film here...and this here...this'll be neat\\" , etc.<br /> The acting and staging in the first scene is on the serious side (almost cinema-francoise) and one would think this will be the tone of the film. Wrong. Caricature and goofiness become the rule.<br /> Pitt is interesting as usual but the accent is dumb and embarrassing. Plus, from the trailers you'd think his character drives the film. Wrong. But then no character or individual theme drives the film. Rampant enthusiasm about film making is the only thread I see connecting the various contrasting and disjointed scenes. Thank god for the sound of a gun going off from time to time.<br /> And I really, really looked forward to the DVD release. Bummer.<br /> Excerpt from Wikipedia:<br />The title of the film was inspired by director Enzo Castellari's 1978 Dirty Dozen-like war film The Inglorious Bastards. Though Tarantino acknowledges that both the former and the latter were inspirations for the film, and there are noticeable similarities, he stresses that Basterds is an original work and not a remake of the 1978 film. To date, there has been little explanation of the title spelling. When asked, Tarantino would not explain the first u in Inglourious and said, \\"But the 'Basterds'? That's just the way you say it: Basterds.\\"[8] He stated in an interview that the misspelled title is \\"a Basquiat-esque touch.\\"[9] He further commented on theLate Show with David Letterman that \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" is the \\"Tarantino way of spelling it.\\"t explain the first u in Inglourious and said, \\"But the 'Basterds'?

B0000073BG|5.0|I was so impressed with the Scheherazade suite on side two that I went out and bought several other albums by this band, none of which came even close to what Scheherazade had lead me to expect.<br /><br />I am not in any way putting down the songs on side one - they're all nice to hear again after so many long and short years - but only the 'long side' of the album (by virtue of the time involved) has what it takes to do justice to the classic (and true!) tale of a clever and inventive young woman having bewitched a demented tyrant with myths and legends of such complexity and intrigue that many of her 2001 stories live on today in one form or another - mostly watered-down Disney-mations.<br /><br />Although Allah-Din's magical lamp and Ali-Baba slaying the forty bandits are entertaining in their own right, it is the tale of Scheherazade herself and how she saved the lives of a thousand innocent young women (believed to have been the model for the biblical Book of Esther) that is told here in a clever combination of music and lyrics.<br /><br />While the vocals in this telling of the ancient legend do a superb job of recounting just how and why the Sultan became enamored of the title character, the music dramatizes and accentuates the deep emotions  and beauty inherent to the story line.<br /><br />This album has been all but impossible to find for many years. Other compilations of the band's music have included only pieces of the \\"Song of Scheherazade\\" and have, for that reason alone, been heartbreakingly disappointing. Here again at last is the original and I, for one, am as happy as a pig in fresh fecal matter to be able to hear it all again in its entirety.
B000000H5K|3.0|This was the last album to date for Sepultura w. Max in their origional form.  This album was the turning point for Sepultura and the albums after and prior to this one are much better than this one, but this one is also really good.  This album features some classic songs that Sepultura & Soul Fly still play regularly but also alot of songs that are just to experimental for me, hence my mixed review.  It's a great album for any Sepultura fan, but as I said I enjoyed the previous early albums and the albums following this one alot more.
B002R0F3Q2|4.0|Interestingly enough the release of this album caught me somewhat by surprise. I wasn't aware until a little less than a month beforehand that Alicia Keys even had a new single out let alone an album on the way. Frankly I was just coming to appreciate [[ASIN:B000VEYJP2 As I Am]] which,while not seamless is extremely true to her creative vision. One of the things that Alica is keeping very strongly in mind during this album is the sound of her big hit from the last release [[ASIN:B000WW1R4O No One]]. Especially on the lead hit here \\"Doesn't Mean Anything\\" the idea of a somewhat slow,highly melodic,catchy,march-like pop/soul type tune is the sound (or as some might see formula) that this album tends to take. Of the 14 songs present here a good dozen of them fit exactly into that catagory but emphasizing thudding,heavily reverrbed 80's style drums. Now some may actually feel nauceous at the very sound of that but honestly: it's not as bad as it would seem. Only thing that doesn't elevante these songs to their proper place is the fact that not only are the arrangements a bit too airy for the weight nature of the songs themselves but many of the choruses and hooks are almost exactly the same. It all has a really good sound but it doesn't exactly challange itself either. There's little sense of Alicia bringing in her many musical ideas and influences into the context of her own vision. After about four songs some of thi airy,ethereal quality seems to bleed together. Even so nothing here ever becomes totally bland and/or offputting,especially considering how the last handfull of songs here really start to catch some serious fire. \\"Put It In A Love Song\\" not only showcases certain vocal similarities between Keys and guest Beyonce but is one of the few uptempo songs on the album. The digital afro-jazz-funk sound of the song is really given a once over by Alicia's always excellent piano work even if Beyonce's \\"text me on my cell phone\\" lyric is typically and annoyingly trendy to the digital age. Even so I do see the humor in that. \\"This Bed\\" has Keys putting the LINN drums into effect for her own unique and strong varriation on the Minneapolis sound. It's not an area she's explored and this proves it's one worth investigating in the future. \\"Empire State Of Mind Part II-Broken Down\\" almost seems like sort of a conclusion to where Alicia Keys has come thus far-expressing as much uncertainty as it does self confidence. The overall feeling I pick up from this album is not so much a lack of direction within itself:rather the reverse actually. But rather the possibility that Alicia is not entirely certain of her future musical direction and that mental line of questioning is having an effect on her present music. It sounds like......an album that's released between one thing and another,trying to cope with one sound while looking to spin out into another. This is not her most knock out recording for that very reason and will not likely go down as one of her all time classics. However considering where this album stands for her it's still rather early in her career to be making any long term musical commitments. We'll just have to keep listening for where she plans on taking us next.cally and annoyingly trendy to the digital age.

B0000669JL|3.0|The cd is great--Bob Marley's music is great.  But the people who sold it to me didn't mention that the cd won't play past a certain song.  It won't play at all on my upright cd player, but on a standard one it will play fine until Buffalo Soldier which is where it begins to skip endlessly.  I still love Amazon, I'd just be cautious about that seller.
031606792X|3.0|In `Breaking Dawn,' the fourth novel in her Twilight Saga, author Stephanie Meyer does the geometrically impossible.  She negates the angst-ridden Bella/Edward/Jacob triangle, converting it into a rather off-balanced rectangle whose fourth side is revealed before the first half of this hefty 700+ pager plays out.  After channeling Shakespeare's [[ASIN:1449517382 Romeo and Juliet]] and Bronte's [[ASIN:1593081286 Wuthering Heights (Barnes & Noble Classics)]] with an adequate amount of emotive success in her first three books, Meyer creates a happily-ever-after for her three main characters that literally lasts forever but fails to have the bite of the first three offerings.<br /><br />None of Twilight's myriad fans really had to guess which of her suitors Bella ultimately chooses.  Any reader of the saga knows from the start that it is Edward all along.  Jacob has his moments in New Moon, but let's face it, Edward `[[ASIN:0316027650 Eclipse (The Twilight Saga)]]s' Teen Wolf with little contest.  At the most, Bella and Jacob share some hot kisses and have some moments on a wolf skin rug--while still attached to the mammal--but other than keeping Bella from getting frostbitten, Jacob really never has a chance.  So there is no surprise that the opening scene in `Breaking Dawn' cements the alliance between the Cullens and the Swans with an Alice-flavored \\"Say \\"Yes\\" to the Dress\\" extravaganza that sets the unreal slightly tinny tone for the rest of the novel.<br /><br />Meyer takes the sacrificial lamb theme that runs through her other three novels and turns it into a burnt offering of sorts where Bella seems to be even more a party to events alien to her personality as an unwilling yet complacent participant.  Its not that fans don't want Bella to wed her vampire hero--of course, they do.  We want the melancholy immortal Edward happily fulfilled by his human counterpart. There is something charmingly fetching about a handsome man, no matter how old, that will do anything for his woman.  Despite the theme of forever love, Meyer neutralizes what could have been some pretty advanced chemistry.  In \\"Eclipse,\\" Edward seems increasingly deadened and not in a sexy undead way. Rather than an irresistible charismatic exemplary specimen of manhood, \\"Breaking Dawn's\\" Edward seems to be increasingly two-dimensional.  His somewhat stilted century-old gentlemanly manners come off as fusty and stultified transforming whatever zip he exhibits in the first novel and portrays in the film version by Robert Pattinson into nothing short of numbingly boring and emotionless. The reader really never feels his love, rather we hear about its functionality, but never experience the connection. Whatever does Bella see in him?  And what in the world does he see in her? By the time the `Breaking Dawn' rolls around, I was ready for Jacob to take off on all fours with Bella on his back just to get away from the trying dialogue that is supposed to express their indelible bond.<br /><br />Meyer fails to convey the chemistry between these Edward and Bella in any tangible way that demonstrates to her readers that their connection is the real deal.  Perhaps in her effort to keep her Saga PG yet modern-teen friendly, she tells rather than shows and her overall product decreases in overall depth because of this.  With the Jacob/Bella relationship, she has less difficulty.  Friendship abounds between the two of them and Meyer has no trouble keeping it chaste despite some corny dialogue and attitude on Bella's part when Jacob understandably puts his wolf paw over the line.  Happily, I was thrilled when the narrative shifted from Bella's first person perspective to that of Jacob's during Bella's difficult pregnancy.  Watching the entire Cullen coven from his eyes helps to see them as the cult they are, waiting, as it is, for their own adaptation and manifestation of Rosemary's Baby.  I don't think I would have wanted to hear Bella's voice at this point anyway--the pain, theblack and blue marks, the bone breaking, the gruesome blood drinking, the Bite-erian Birth--all of that would have been too much bleating from that particular lamb.  I'd like to hear more from Jacob in the future and not just as a child's \\"Heel, Lassie, Heel\\" wolf pup plaything.<br /><br />After Bella and Edward's love is consummated and baby hybrid is on the way, Meyer spends the rest of the novel refabricating Bella as the perfect vampire wife.  Gone is the awkward Bella of old--after producing Baby Prodigy Renesmee, she becomes nothing short of perfect.  Not only is she beautiful, powerful and ultra-controlled for a newbie bloodsucker, she, like other special vampires, realizes that she possesses supernatural abilities that even surprise and confound the great vampire minds who have had centuries to cultivate.  Yikes!  How marvelous can it all be?  Talk about a deus ex machina--`Breaking Dawn' is populated with droves of such sorry literary cop-outs with nary a reason to even explore the question that drove the entire series--the possibility of an alternative life as a mortal with the warm-blooded Jacob.  How can scared and clumsy Bella suddenly be the most graceful anime heroine of all time?  Too fake, predictable and perfect.  Bella loses the vulnerability that made her real.<br /><br />When Meyer resolves her triangle with the ease of a snap of her literary fingers, she destroys what is already a crumbling and never fully fleshed out depiction of fun and nearly fatal first love. Transforming Bella into Uber-Vamp complete with a silly girl-gone-wild-on-Rodeo-Drive Alice designed costume change that suggests a snake-skinned Angelina Jolie in [[ASIN:B0011NVC98 Beowulf]] moves the entire realm of the story from romantic dilemma to blas&eacute; science fiction.  The scenes with the vampire clans and the ensuing Volturi seem overpopulated, pageant-y and yet another venue where Bella can finally protect herself and her seemingly clueless and powerless family in the ultimate act of self-sacrifice.<br /><br />Bottom line?  \\"Breaking Dawn\\" is a very readable story that too formulaically ties up all the loose ends regarding the self-identity and self-worth issues explored by Bella in the Twilight Saga's first three offerings. With too pat resolutions and too little emotional exploration, `Breaking Dawn' fails to satisfy the die-hard fan especially with regard to a more explicit connection between Edward and his Bella.  Author Stephanie Meyer's solution for Jacob disappoints, as the main beauty of the series relied upon the emotional pain between the three main characters.  Once this angst disappears, the glue that binds the tale together falls apart, relying instead on a sci-fi theme that smacks of mediocrity.  Will Meyer resurrect her foursome in a later novel?  I'd like to read more about Jacob, as for me, he was the most real of the players.  The reduction of his character to a wolverine Lassie was a bit disturbing for me.  Nevertheless, I did enjoy this and recommend it regardless of its faults.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\\"reneofc\\"arks, the bone breaking, the gruesome blood drinking, the Bite-erian Birth--all of that would have been too much bleating from that particular lamb.

0399226907|2.0|My baby was just not interested in this book, which was strange because he loves pictures of food.  I think maybe he just wasn't interested in the caterpillar since it doesn't really have a facial expression or a face.  He loves many other books just not this one, and for the price I was very dissapointed.
B000RZGIOA|1.0|I love this movie. If you are reading this, the chances are you love it too and want to see it in a better quality.<br />This blu ray is nowhere near blu ray. I watched it in a very good Full HD top notch system. (Bowers & Wilkins speakers, Panasonics AE 4000 Projector etc.)<br />The transfer of the original movie is simply TERRIBLE. There are only few shots that makes you feel that you are watching a bluray. Nowhere near SpiderMan 3 or Baraka.<br />The people who does the blu ray transfer simply don't care about what they're doing. This is so bad for people who made this film. So bad.<br />Blu Ray is not a great technology after all. Maybe we people should start asking 4K (Cinema Resolution) or Red Ray (A new technology).

B0001CCY7E|5.0|I think I just splurted all over myself listening to this AMAZING SOUNDTRACK!!!!! It has reduced me to a blithering, blubbering, jiggly mass of baby batter. O.M.G! And I'm not even selling this Cd REALLY I'M NOT!!! HOW DARE YOU SUGGEST IT IS NOT SO!! Seriously, it'll make you mess yourself...IT'S ****THAT**** GOOD!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I enjoyed the movie, they did well in representing the old and true Star Trek.    BUT.....................    At the end of the movie the old Spock tells the young Spock to enjoy his emotions.........So we have the death of the real Spock character. No more \\"..It is logical Captain..\\" to be replaced by \\"..do you think Uhura loves me...\\" whine whine!    So it tells me that this brief and very welcome return of the real Star Trek will be short and it will rapidly deteriorate into the sugar coated carp that plagues so much of our action movies/TV series today.    I live in dread as to what they will do next.    I have purchased both the DVD and Blu ray versions but I fear it may be the last.
B002MU4NL8|5.0|This is an old favorite movie of mine, so it was an easy decision to buy the Blu Ray version, and it did not disappoint.  The extras are nice, but it's the movie itself that draws me back time and again to watch and laugh.
B00005J6UP|5.0|What makes this movie so great is not only the great stories, but the lovable and believable characters.<br /><br />The story starts actually quite sad in that some friends are going to have to leave their homes, which of course also means leaving each other. We then have just a glimmer of hope that they won't have to leave. (If they can find an old pirate's treasure.) Now what is interesting here is that the hope revolves around a willingness to believe again as a child.<br /><br />Now what is interesting here is that the 4 young friends set off on this journey together, and gradually, Sean Astin's older brother, his possible girl friend, and her friend join the party. (The party started with 4 young children, and 3 older people ended up joining the party.)<br /><br />They go through an interesting series of caves filled with traps in hopes of saving their homes. What is especially interesting here is that no one is there without a purpose. (Corey Feldman knows Spanish and can read the map; Data has some gadgets that may prove useful; Andy can play the keyboard at a crucial time; Brandon is a little older, so he may be acquainted with some dangers the younger crew is not ready for, etc.<br /><br />Of course, we can't have it that easy. They are later persued by 3 The Fratellis who are very bad. But they carry a charm that makes them likable despite their crimes.  A signature moment is when one of the Fratellis complains that his mother always liked the other son better, and then she slaps him and says: \\"That's right.\\"<br /><br />An especially funny moment with the Fratellis is when they want their prisoner Chunk to tell them EVERYTHING about the hidden treasure, but he takes it literally, and tells them every bad thing he ever did. And one of them gets interested in Chunk's confessions and responds: \\"I'm starting to like this kid.\\"<br /><br />While the movie may seem simple, it is never boring. And the delightful interaction of the characters who aren't exactly experts, but who all have something to contribute to this journey may very well thrust this movie into the classics.<br /><br />It is emotionally enduring; funny; suspenseful; and full of adventure. Why? Because it's \\"The Goonies!\\"tribute to this journey may very well thrust this movie into the classics.     It is emotionally enduring; funny; suspenseful; and full of adventure. Why? Because it's \\"The Goonies!\\"
B000AM4PBS|1.0|This is funny Because Amazon is asking me for my review on this product which I ordered on Nov 13th and 32 days later I still havent got it yet. I think I'll have to think twice before I order from AMAZON.com again. There is my review.
B001AQR3E4|3.0|I cant believe this is being sold as a Blu Ray dvd. It does not look like a Blu Ray at all, but rather a standard dvd. This movie deserves better than this. Save your money.
B001KVZ6F2|1.0|Clint Eastwood does a wonderful acting job, but the minority actors he hired for this film are truly horrendous.  They were so bad it kept taking me out of the moment for what would have otherwise been a fine film.      Clint, what were you thinking in hiring these people?  They were worse than what you might expect from a really bad junior high play.
B0011KQSZ4|2.0|A relative who'd seen this film reported it as VERY funny so I ordered it. Delivery by Amazon was VERY slow and the film was simply awful when it finally arrived - others ideas of funny ??  Not again.
B002PMV9FG|3.0|I thought that it was quite choppy for most of the movie until the end. I was confused by alot of it. It didn't dwell very much on the important things like the Weasley housing burning down or Dumbledorfs death. There was too much jumping from one scene to the next. Once you get past that you get to some of the plot of the movie. I wish it were like the rest. I will buy the movie of course and the ending was sad but I had more questions than I recieved answers with this one.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This CD showcases the voice we've come to know. None of Susan Boyle's original songs, however. You will recognize all of them.    Looking forward to her music in the future and hopefully some original music.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Congratulation Susan Boyle! What a wonderfully God given gifted talent that Susan Boyle has, and I am glad she came to A.I to share her song with us.  Thanks Susan! I am very pleased with your CD, and I am glad you had the words for the songs on the sleeve of the CD.    I am also pleased that Simon C. kept his words and helped Susan Boyle produced her first CD and kept it at an affordable price for everyone to enjoy.

B002PMV9FG|2.0|I was looking forward to this movie despite the previous one being terrible. When the movie was over I got the impression they were more worried about who wants to go out with who and then had periodic flashes of \\"Oh yeah, evil guy wants to kill us.\\"<br /><br />This movie could have been better and toned down on the love stuff, there at war not on a dating game. I hope Deathly Hollows is better because right now the best one so far is \\"Goblet of Fire.\\"<br /><br />So if you a Potter Fan, rent before you buy!
B001L41X3W|5.0|An absolute must-have 4-CD box set with a total of 56 tracks of the lengthy Kiss repertoire. Liked hearing some tunes that one (may) not hear on an every day basis, like \\"God Of Thunder\\", \\"Ladies Room\\", \\"Love 'Em And Leave 'Em\\", \\"Take Me\\", one of my favorite Kiss 'deep album' cuts \\"Plaster Caster\\" and \\"New York Groove\\". Plus some songs that I failed to recognize right off the bat such as \\"Mr. Speed\\", Ace Frehley's \\"Snow Blind\\", \\"Baby Driver\\" (off of their 1976 'Rock And Roll Over' lp - I don't remember this track at all) and \\"Mainline\\". Material here comes from Kiss titles, 1974-1998. If you have this box set, you don't really need any of their other compilation releases. Highly recommended
B000UJ48WC|5.0|I have both the DVD and Blueray.  The Blueray disc is phenomenal: outstanding picture quality and the extras it has the DVD doesn't.  The most eye-opening feature to me was the commentary steady cam operator Garrett Brown and Kubrick biographer John Baxter; they really gets into the weeds of the actual moviemaking and mindset of Kubrick and provides a fascinating inside look into the filming process.  This is definitely a permanent addition to my blueray collection and has increased my awareness and appreciation for Stanley Kubrick.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Definitely, this box set has come to fulfill all my expectations about The Beatles'Discography. Pictures and artwork included in each LP is simply wonderful. Even the CDs are labeled like the original vinyls releases. Listening to them, I've been able to find out new sounds, new instruments that I hadn't found out before, through all these years enjoying Beatles' songs.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|This is the only blueray I am willing to pay full price for since the extra features themselves are worthwhile seeing.  Most features are shot in high def which is an added bonus as well.  I really liked how they pulled back the curtain and revealed how the special effects shot were created.  The picture quality is as everyone says here is stunning.  The standard DVD even when upconverted cannot compare to the immense details of Blueray.  I have been very happy with this purchase and hope others enjoy and experience this amazing BD.  This is def. a 5 star purchase for me.
B000V6I7WG|4.0|I've read some of the negative reviews for this movie, and I will say that if you are sensitive to fairly graphic violence or what ends up being extermely intense and some would say horrific subject matter then this movie may not be your \\"cup of tea\\"    However it is mine and this movie is outstanding.  I'm going to try to do this without spoilers.  If I notice any I'll put some warnings in there.  The story is about a man who is kidnapped on his daughter's 3rd birthday and is held captive for 15 years in what appears to be a small studio apartment.  He is never permitted to leave this one room and his only connection with the outside world is a small telivision set.  He is fed the same meal 3 times a day every day.  One day he is drugged and unconscious and wakes up on the roof of a building.  This is where he sets off to find out what happened to him and why.      It all builds and builds and builds to an intense confrontation at the end that has the most shocking, jaw dropping, can't believe what I was seeing/hearing twist endings I have ever seen.  I literally gasped for breath covered my mouth and had to remind myself to both breath and blink again.      Yes throughout the plot there are some pretty silly scenarios like the main character surviving several injuries that in the real world would kill a person without prompt medical attention, or him beating back a whole hoard of armed gangsters with nothing more than a hammer (AWESOME SCENE THOUGH).  The good far outweighs the slight missteps.    I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Quentin Tarantino or Robert Rodgiguez or any other violent revenge films.  If you don't think you can stomach the violence or subject matter then by all means skip it.  You're missing out though.
B002PMV9K6|2.0|The entire series of HP movies has been inconsistent at best.  The first three were excellent in every way - from the scripting to the acting, special effects, character development, etc.  No. 4 (Goblet of Fire) was okay - but gratituous and vivid violence - not a kid's movie.  No. 5 redeemed itself somewhat, but felt sketchy and showed little or no character development.  Alas - my high hopes for #6 were dashed.  Very slow start left me waiting for something - ANYTHING to happen - very disjointed.  As I continued watching, I saw a few small redeeming story lines emerge, but the character development was missing.  Again, the script was disjointed - and the violence still more mature than a 10-year-old should see.  All this movie did was to confirm two of my suspicions about two prominent characters.  No - I won't be a spoiler and tell you what happens.  We're lucky that the script revealed anything at all! Please, Harry - graduate from Hogwarts!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Another well thought out and executed movie by Pixar. This movie has so many dimensions and humor that the whole family will love.
1416562605|5.0|Aravind Adiga takes the reader on a chauffeured ride with driver Balram Halwai through India's divided social classes and the entrapment felt at all levels of his social hierarchy.  His rooster coop metaphor humanizes the reality of a \\"chicken eat chicken\\" existence that \\"flies\\" the coop and pervades his society.  Everyone Balram interacts with is exchanging their moral integrity for the opportunity to gain a perceived higher position.  Even clever Balram, a white tiger in his own mind, lives in a cage.  The reader can easily see similar situations in their own society and the self justifications that feed the social coop mentality.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Still loving this movie. My wife and I are not Trekers, but we were intrigued by the number of positive reviews of this movie. Sure enough, this movie didn't let us down and would highly recommend the Blu-Ray version and the hours of extras that come with it! Quite fun, interesting, and entertaining!
0689865384|4.0|A terrific, timely idea, snappily written, with great future concepts. What I enjoyed most about this work is I had no idea where it was going to go; I just let the story take me there. I liked that I wasn't sure where it took place, or when; what had happened to the world ('the panic') to make things this way; and, really, what the rest of the world was like. Somehow, Westerfeld was able to pull things off without too much backstory, which left the plot to rocket forward. I also liked that while this book is probably categorized as 'dystopian', it's really it's own twisted version of 'utopian,' which is very tricky to pull off. Now, it's hard for me to read things nowadays without comparing them to 'The Hunger Games,' so I have to say what was more troublesome for me about 'Uglies' was the skill of the writing was solid but not on a par with L'Engle or Le Guin, and the slang was a little difficult to get used to. But on a whole I thought it was sharply done and look forward to reading the next one.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This is a great movie! It isn't one the \\"traditional\\" sugar coated animated films that seem to be cropping up every week. This movie actually has a plot and covers some real topics like love and death. I've watched it twice with our 8 year old son and it is still a great time.<br />The animation is incredible. The humans are still drawn very cartoonish but that helps with the story. The animals are drawn very lifelike and if you focus your attention on little things like the hair on the dogs or the feathers on the bird you will be amazed.<br />The voice acting is top notch. Ed Asner plays the old man and he pulls the story along fabulously.<br /><br />Overall this is one of the best movies Disney/Pixar has put out in a long while.<br /><br />Bradman
B000000W71|5.0|Like new CD.  Fast delivery and a great price.  What more could one ask for?
B0000AK7AC|2.0|The movie is a classic, but I wouldn't purchase this DVD again.  You are forced to sit through 10 minutes of previews, some of which are inappropriate for kids.  There is no way to skip through the previews.
B001FB55HQ|2.0|I decided to rent it first because I wasnt 100% sure about if this movie was any good.<br />In my humble opinion, this didnt hold a candle to the first 2 Terminator movies..it was flat. Completely flat. Like watching a blank TV screen for 2 hours.<br />It lacked any of the ingredients that made the first 2 superior films. Even the 3rd Terminator film was better than this dribble. The film really just dragged for me and didn't have enough plot or story to hold my interest. This was another 2009 movie that spends a lot for explosions but zero on characterization. The characters were unlikeable & just bland to show any real interest. Who knew John Connor would be a boring/bland character as an adult ?<br />Sure there are a few moments with the Terminator robots going after the characters (what was Christian Bale thinking??) but it wasn't much. It was a whole lot of nothing going on. Even the naked \\"Schwartzenegger\\" Terminator running around trying to kill Connor wasn't anything special<br />Arnold Schwarzenegger may not be that great a governor but at least the Terminator movies he did had substance, a good story and a director who knew what it takes to make a good science fiction futuristic story with characters to root for a care about. If they make another Terminator film it should be directed by James Cameron in other words.<br />I would only see it if you like the Terminator series & are curious to see this one.<br />They shouldn've really stuck at 2 to be blunt..
0316036692|4.0|I found this book to be entertaining and well written.  The conclusions the author reaches, however, are based on less than scientific analyses.  I gave the book a 4 star rating because of the lack of science and the many assumptions he makes based on correlations that sometimes are weak.  That said, I also feel that he brings up interesting points and makes one stop and think.  This is an outstanding book for a group discussion.
B0026P3G12|3.0|As a fan since her \\"Britain's Got Talent\\" show, I was so excited to hear her first CD! What a disappointment!  Over-engineered, her passion and clear voice muted to a \\"commercialized\\" seller version of Susan Boyle. Especially disappointing is her signature song \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" where the orchestration completely overwhelms her magnificent voice.
B001L51RQE|5.0|The product is very good, but the CD was damaged and I could not play one of the songs...which should have been stated in the ad...
B00005YTN5|5.0|So much has been said and written about this album since its release in March 1967, that a review of the material is irrelevant, and commentary pointless. Inarguably, it is one of the most influential LPs of all time. So let's look instead at what this *release* of \\"The Velvet Underground and Nico\\" IS.<br />Over the years, the Velvet Underground catalog has begun to get the overhaul it has always deserved, and this Deluxe Edition set is another example of that. If the \\"Peel Slowly And See\\" Box Set and the \\"Fully Loaded Edition\\" of \\"Loaded\\" appeal to you, you'll find this indispensable.<br /><br />Why both the mono *and* stereo versions of the LP? Differences in the mixes, my friends. Some subtle, some more immediately evident. The casual listener might not spot the differences immediately, but track to track comparisons between the two will be instructive to the faithful. The mono version has been deemed collectable enough to be bootlegged in the past, so it is fitting that it be legitimately released for the completist collectors among us. For what it's worth,I found the mono versions of the singles excessive, as the stereo versions are to be found on the \\"Peel Slowly And See...\\" box set, HOWEVER, the tracks from Nico's \\"Chelsea Girl\\" were penned by Velvets Cale, Morrison & Reed, who also perform on these tracks. As such, they deserve to be included in the band's output *somewhere*, and as they chronologically follow the 1st LP, it makes sense that they be included here--they're certainly as strong musical numbers as anything else on these CDs.<br /><br />If you're a Velvet Underground fan (as I've been for well over two decades), you've already bought this CD, perhaps, like me, several times, between the initial release, the remaster, the box set, the 24K Gold Edition. If you have that level of dedication, TRUST ME, you won't feel cheated when you get this baby home, BUT it's not ONLY for completists--more casual fans will find, I'd predict, that they'll have a greater appreciation for this LP, and the ones that follow it because of the breadth of this CD, the liner notes, and lyrics--it truly is \\"The Deluxe Edition.\\"or this LP, and the ones that follow it because of the breadth of this CD, the liner notes, and lyrics--it truly is \\"The Deluxe Edition.\\"
0545123267|5.0|What a beautiful story of first love! Unputdownable! You can just feel the love the two characters share for one another. The book has a different take on werewolves that I had not read before. Love how the book leaves you feeling satisfied, no cliffhangers. It's one of those books that could have a sequel or not... though I just went to her website and read that there will be 3 books in this series. Yeah! Can't wait to read on!
B002MTTZ5I|5.0|I've been reading the somber reviews and can't believe what I'm reading.  They are a PARODY band, not serious, on purpose.      These songs are well done metal reproductions of the best of metal from bygone days, when metal could be FUN as well as dark.  Everything doesn't have to make a statement.  The lyrics are just the epitome of what these bands were really doing as well as possibly saying between the lines.    This album is hilarious and fun and worth the effort and price.  Beware, the lyrics are very raunchy, if you can't handle that, then this is certainly not for you.    STEEL PANTHER ROCKS!!!!
B000F7CMRW|5.0|This movie deals with one of the most pertinent issues in today's geo-political world, and it is admirable that it has been brought to DVD format.  The content of the movie and the special feature interviews shed important light on some of the 'shady' dealings that go on in the industrial world.    I work in the Petro-Chemical Industry, and it is an eye-opener to see what is UNDOUBTABLY going on inside many Companies' boardrooms, and how decisions made there affect workers lives, and societies' perceptions.    A heartily RECOMMENDED movie.
B00000ITOY|5.0|My daughter received this as a birthday gift when she turned 1, and I remember thinking, 'This toy looks boring. She'll never play with it.' I was wrong, wrong, wrong: It is one of the best toys she has (and, trust me, she has A LOT). My daughter is 2 now, and she still plays with this almost every day. Now that she's 2, she can do all sorts of things with it, and I see that she creates challenges for herself--she'll stack them all by color (blues first, then reds, etc.), or she'll name the shape and color before putting the shape into its corresponding peg, or she'll try to see what shapes can fit into the other pegs.

B001UE276A|4.0|I don't know about you, but I like storing my CD's and DVD's in the usual jewel box not a big 10x10 box that won't even fit on my shelves.  Then they give you a flimsy cardboard disc cover with printing colors you can not read.  It is even difficult to determine which disc is which.  I don't know about you, but I am over 60 and don't need the other nonsense packaged with the disc.<br />The big box will be tossed out and I will find jewel boxes and print what is inside, but it's too bad to talk about this when the music is the main point.  I like the music very much but have to redo the packaging - pretty silly,  Have we not outgrown this Europe thing?  I hope so.

B000GY729M|5.0|Almost 3 years ago, Rolling Stone reviewed this album and gave it 2 stars out of a possible 5.  Today it was announced by no other than Rolling Stone that this is the most underated album of the decade.  Finally some validation for The Killers.    If you slept on this album to begin with because every music publication was trashing it, please let this be a notice to go pick it up.    If you listened to the album once and said \\"this doesn't sound like Hot Fuss\\", please let this be a notice to start listening to this album again.

B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|I love all of Hayao Miyazaki's movies and I loved Ponyo. This was the first movie in a theater that my squirmy 3 yr daughter ever saw and she was simply entranced and actually sat through the whole thing. I recommend this wondrous charming movie to any age group and any person. It is artful and marvelous.    Now given all that is this particular DVD version the English dubbed one that was seen in American theaters? It is very confusing. The Amazon page gives the American Actors as the principle players in the animated movie and then says it is Japanese with English Subtitles. I am very hesitant to buy this version for my kids since it does not appear to know what it actually is.

B002R0F3Q2|5.0|The reviews for the latest Alicia Keys' release have been mixed, but this is a stellar piece of work--make no mistake about it.  Is it like the first release SIAM?  Absolutely not, but it shows that she has grown as an artist and is not willing to limit herself to some formulaic career.  It does put you in the mind of As I Am, but softer.  This is something you can put in and find yourself immersed in it.  I agree with another reviewer who said we shouldn't want the same ole thing produced by an artist time after time.  Each release should show growth and add dimension and layers.  We have different experiences and those experiences should help shape and create the music so that it is authentic and from the heart.  TEOF is one such piece of work.  I applaud Alicia for being who she is and always willing to take risk for work and her fans.  I love this cd and think real fans are in a for treat and new fans will become lifetime lovers of her music.  Kudos for a job well done!!
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|I had been searching for a good blu-ray or DVD to share with some friends who will be coming over for a movie night.  It being near Christmas, I was looking for something seasonal with picture and sound quality that would shine on my new large screen TV and blu-ray player.  After much searching, I stumbled upon this one.  It is outstanding, heartwarming, simply marvelous!  My daughter, my wife, and I were in tears at some points, the music was so moving.  It has gotten us in the Christmas mood, finally!!      Andrea and David are a dynamic duo.  And the varied guests added just a special touch.    I have a Plasma TV (Panasonic G15 - 50\\") that I purchased recently, and a blu-ray player (Panasonic DMP-BD60), hooked up to an aging surround sound receiver (Yamaha RX-V995) and speaker setup (Infinity main, center, & surrounds, and a Klipsch subwoofer) .  This DVD does very well on my system.  The picture quality is very good.  And the sound, equally so.  I was very pleased.  This is going to be a keeper, something my family and I will watch for many Christmases to come!    Oh!  BTW, the DVD arrived in just a few days, well before I expected it.  Great job Amazon!    I think I'll order a couple more to give as presents.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|The design of this controller is perfect for Mario Kart. The handles gives you a firm grip on this controller unlike the smooth design of the regular wii controller. I also like that the left joystick is above the d-pad which makes turning your kart easier. The Left button is perfect for when you have to hold a green shell or fake prize because of the design your finger wont slip off. The best part of this controller is the 10ft cord! YES thats right! 10Feetz! no more playing jump rope with your Wii console! I also like that it is an Official Nintendo controller. Ive bought cheap copycat controllers from other companys in the past but they ALWAYS seem to break down so fast. Its better to spend a little bit more money for a better product. My kids have a large assortment of Wii games and this is the controller that they prefer to use all the time. Highly Recommended!!!
B002RSDW80|3.0|I made the mistake of reading the book before I saw the movie.  While the Julia Child parts of the film were magical -- thus three stars -- with Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci (and their entire supporting cast!) turning out beautiful work, the powers-that-be succeeded in gutting the Julie Powell storyline, taking a brilliantly witty woman and turning her into an unsympathetic, whiny, narcissistic little twit onscreen. As other reviewers mentioned, I found myself becoming more and more impatient to get back to the Julia storyline -- so much so, that I began to fast-forward through the Julie parts.  I do understand the need to edit down the vast number of scenes in the book (or we would end up with a movie 10 hours long), but Julie Powell deserved so much more -- this film is not a fair representation of who she is, by a long shot.  It was as if all of the creative energy was funnelled into the Julia scenes, and Julie Powell was simply an afterthought.  The other frustrating part is that I would have really loved to have seen a full-length movie centered completely around Julia Child with the same cast of characters -- they were cast perfectly -- but I suppose this movie cancels out the possibility of that ever happening.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I thought this season was better than season 2.  Probably up there with season 1.  Definitely a good buy.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|If you have seen the movies or know the story, the book is a completely different experiance!

Highly recommended!
1416594787|5.0|In The Greatest Show, Dawkins the famous atheist provides experiemental evidence for evolution.<br /><br />For those expecting a diatribe against religion or a lampooning of creationists don't read this book. Dawkins sticks strictly to a diet of explaining the facts. Sure occasionally he pokes fun at creationist theory, but the basis of the book is biology lessons.<br /><br />While I imagine some people who won't have read the book will tirade and condemn this book, the book isn't particularly controversial (unless of course you vehemently deny evolution, or read the appendix on history-deniers). Dawkins even restrains himself from criticising those who believe God made evolution.<br /><br />Recommended for those who want to learn more about evolution from a plain-speaking perspective.
B000ZECQ08|2.0|Very long movie. The director David Yates has more of a grasp on the special effects aspect in this film but the story plods along and the ending is ,well, not presented or as built up to as in the book.
B002Y5210G|5.0|Alicia Keys evolves on this album, which is great. Now for people who do not like change, this may not be for you. Some fans like their singers to stick to the same ole, same ole. However, how boring is that? I respect artists who take their art to the next level, and Alicia has done just that.     Favorites:    \\"Love Is Blind\\". This is a total break away from our old Alicia. She goes there people, and I love it.   \\"Wait Til You See Me Smile\\". Here, we feel Alicia in many elements of the song. Vocals, lyrics and that Piano playing along. Classic Alicia.  \\"How It Feels To Fly\\". This song does that...takes you on a journey. It's soars and ends on a high note. Beautiful song.  \\"Empire State of Mind (Part 2) Broken Down\\"...Nice job on making it her own.    If you are a true Alicia Keys fan, get your copy. You won't be disappointed.

B001GCUNW6|5.0|This is a funny movie! It's got laughs at every turn. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it really was, and the clarity of Blu-ray only makes it that much better. Just when you thought they might have run out of idea's for this storyline, they came up with Dawn of the Dinosaurs. The 'Dinosaurs' putting a whole new twist on everything. The squirrel is back 'nuttier' than ever. This time around he has a girlfriend to deal with! He'll never be the same again! I must say, I was happy to see more of the squirrel in the third movie.  After watching Dawn of the Dinosaurs you are hoping-wondering for Ice Age 4? I will say, I never get tired of the Ice Age movies, they are fun to watch. This third installment is highly recommended, especially in 1080p Blu-ray.

B002Q9MZF6|5.0|What a beautiful piece, and what marvelous performances! Let me begin with Nicole Cabell as Musetta; this exotic beauty possesses amazing expression and humor. Watch Villazon's face, falling in love as he listens raptly to Mimi as she tells of herself: \\"all things gentle bring me joy; I don't always go to mass, but often pray alone in my little room\\". And Netrebko is entirely convincing, shyly beautiful yet passionate; the protagonists' passion is sincere and moving. The city streets and rooftops in the snow are a perfect backdrop to the tale, which alternates between joy and sorrow. Certainly this new version of this very popular piece need not yield to any other.
B002MW50KO|2.0|My own throat feels strained listening to Mr. Dylan struggle through this genre.  It's not for him... the \\"sweet\\" backup singers just don't help, and almost seem comical as counterpart to the raspy/harsh voice of this \\"rebel-icon.\\"  If I were a little kid, I'd run and hide my head under the pillow rather than listen... actually, I may do that myself.
B000002KDS|5.0|1 STAR FOR SOUND... This album was great! Start to finish, but like many have said... The sound pretty much blows.    Too bad Alice just seems to be a \\"trademark\\" now instead of a man that seems to care about his past achievements (let alone the fans that made him what he is today.)    Hey Alice! All we really want is some quality recordings of those great LP's we grew up on, so how about throwing us a dead baby that still might have a little life left in somewhere!    is that asking to much???
B0026P3G12|5.0|Knowing Susan Boyle's rise to fame, I couldn't resist buying her first CD. I am blown away by her angelic voice. The entire CD is wonderful, but even if you buy it for \\"How Great Thou Art\\" and \\"Amazing Grace\\", it's still worth the price.

B0026P3G12|4.0|I cried when she sang it on TV for the first time, so powerful and genuine.  She was simply being herself.  More credible performances I had never heard.  It was superb.  New look, and new sound.  It's just not the same, and I'm disappointed, although it still makes me cry.  Interpreting songs is a two-edge sword, all too capable of separating the artist from her art.      Linguistically, interpretation is an art, taking on another language to convey a   message at different levels, simultaneously.  Musically, it can make the speaker susceptible to the temptation to simulate other voices, inflection honed to near perfection.  I wanted to hear Susan Boyle, not strains of Streisand, Minelli and Brightman.      What made her debut with \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" so incredible was focus on the song, and not the styling.  An honest, forthright sound, and instant connection.  Sure, there are those who will applaud the polish and sophistication evident on the CD.  They have their views, and I have mine.

B002R0F3Q2|5.0|Alicia Key's \\"The Element of Freedom\\" is on par with her first and second albums. It is outstanding. This is the Alicia you remember from her earlier work, not the screaming Aretha Franklin Alicia, which I find nothing wrong with, but if you loved her \\"Butterfly\\" \\"Diary\\" \\"Fallen\\" \\"Mr. Man\\" voice, you will love this album. It is a preferance. She doesn't belch out hig notes as much, its just sweet and humble. Almost every song on this album has single potential. Except for the track with her and Beyonce, each track is crafted beautifully. I Love \\"Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart\\" but check out \\"Unthinkable\\" which is sleeper hit. I complete disagree with one of the reviewers who hated, \\"Empire State of Mind 2\\" because it sounds even better.  Pick this album up, its worth it, best work in 6 years, I love it.
B000000OU0|4.0|...and the studio tracks ain't half bad either.    \\"Get Over It\\" is a real rocker.  \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive\\" and \\"The Girl From Yesterday\\" are very country-sounding, but still good tracks.  \\"Learn To Be Still\\" is an excellent song.  All four of these prove that the Eagles still have it.    The remainder of the album are live tracks.  Wow, what a show!  The intro to \\"Hotel California,\\" as others have mentioned, is easily the stand out piece on the disc.  It proves so well how much Don Felder is missed in more modern Eagles concerts.  Other highlights include the rocking \\"Life in the Fast Lane,\\" a beautiful \\"Desperado\\" as the finale, and a great version of \\"Take it Easy.\\"    If you are interested in live Eagles, this is the one to start with (and rarely do I say that about reunion concerts).  An excellent show indeed.

B0013USZHG|5.0|\\"Fiesta\\" released in 2008 stands as one of the best recordings to date by the young conductor Gustavo Dudamel and his youth orchestra of Simon Bolivar. I'm not that impressed with Dudamel's other recordings of Mahler, Beethoven, or Tchaikovsky. Hopefully, his tenure with the Los Angeles Philharmonic will surprise audiences with more Latin American repertoire. Whatever happens, \\"Fiesta\\" is a particuarly fine recording that, in my opinion, demostrates Dudamel's true musical vision.<br /><br />Revueltas' \\"Sensemaya\\" opens up the program and is probably one of the greatest pieces of Mexican classical music ever written (next to Chavez's \\"Sinfonia India\\" of course). \\"Sensemaya\\" has a great Stravinsky-like feel to much of the piece. It's very strong rhythmically, but it is also very dynamic. As I have stated in another review, I heard someone refer to it has a Mexican \\"Bolero,\\" but honestly this isn't a fair description. It's far from it. Another highlight for me were the Carreno and Estevez pieces. The Carreno piece, called \\"Marcaritena,\\" has a beautiful melody that will linger in your mind for days after hearing it. The Estevez pieced \\"Mediodia En El Llano\\" also has a gorgeous melody and it comes to a great climax with a sweeping feel. The Ginastera composition \\"Estancia,\\" is in suite form and is one of the most aggressive pieces of Latin American music I've ever heard. Ginastera was obviously influenced by Stravinsky, but he adds his own character and Argentinian influence to his music, which gives his music a very refreshing and exotic feel.<br /><br />The performances from the Simon Bolivar Youth Orch. Of Venezuela are top-notch. The sound quality is also excellent.<br /><br />I will say that I would have liked to hear some Carlos Chavez on this recording like maybe his \\"Sinfonia India,\\" \\"Caballos de vapor,\\" or \\"Sinfonia Romantica.\\" Also curiously missing from the program were works by Villa-Lobos (a composer I consider one of the greatest of his generation). These are small gripes of course. This is a great recording and hopefully will signal more great things to come. Highly recommended.e.

B00000K3CK|5.0|I suppose I have a stronger memory of this film from childhood than of any other holiday-themed movie, save perhaps A CHRISTMAS CAROL - but there I'm probably remembering at least 2 or 3 versions all sort of mushed together.  The '47 MIRACLE stands alone though, and Edmund Gwenn will forever be Santa Claus to me.<br /><br />The film opens documentary-style, with the camera following an old conventionally-dressed man (Gwenn) down the street in New York, snow falling lightly.  He taps on a window pane - the startled shop employee, fixing up a holiday display of Santa and his reindeer opens the door to see what he wants, only to be remonstrated pleasantly on the proper placement of the toy animals.  You see, this old man knows what he's talking about.  Soon he spots a drunken Santa at the Macy's parade and after upbrading him is replaced - and then hired as the department store's ambassador for the holiday season.  But he's no ordinary pretending elf, as the store's staff psychologist Mr. Sawyer (Porter Hall) finds out - nor is he willing to pretend to the public that Macys is the be-all and end-all of their shopping needs, recommending that customers go elsewhere if they can't find it in Herald Square.<br /><br />If you don't know the rest, well, you should, and I won't spoil it for you.  Suffice it to say that Santa/Kris manages to charm lawyer Fred Gailey (the underrated John Payne) smitten with his neighbor Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara), who happens to be the woman who hired him, and takes on as his special project the re-introduction of the woman's far-too-serious young daughter Susan (Natalie Wood) to worlds of myth, fantasy, and belief.  When Kris's sanity is questioned, and Mr. Sawyer contrives to get him sent to Bellevue, it's up to these three to prove that he is, in fact, the magical spirit he claims to be.<br /><br />Despite the whole story being essentially about belief - about whether one ought to have \\"proof\\" for everything, about whether things are always as they seem to be - one of the most interesting elements of MIRACLE is the complete lack of religious elements.  Perhaps the word \\"God\\" is mentioned in passing once or twice; I'm fairly sure \\"Jesus\\" never is.  Santa Claus here represents human goodness and kindness and generosity - which aren't, after all, specific to Christianity or Christmas.  They're human values belonging to all peoples and all faiths, and the film doesn't reduce it's message to reflect the holiday itself even if the setting reflects it.  One could, I suppose, posit that Doris and Susan's lack of belief in Santa or anything demanding \\"faith\\" is indicative of a spiritual lack, but the film wisely doesn't push hard on this notion, leaving it up to us to decide just what (besides Santa and childhood games) they might be missing in their lives.<br /><br />The casting is just wonderful - Gwenn won a well-deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar, though I think he's closer to being the lead, and Payne and O'Hara and Wood are all quite fine as well.  Gene Lockhart as the sort-of-principled judge and Philip Tonge as Doris' coworker Mr. Shellhammer nearly steals every scene he's in.  The location work in New York is a pleasant surprise in a film made in this era and certainly lends an air of authenticity; like the opening scene, the Macys parade has a documentary feel to it that isn't typical for the studio-bound productions that were nearly all of Hollywood's output at this time.  The only real problem I have with it is the rather too speedy wrap-up; it's always hard to pull real drama out of a courtroom scene when you know how it's got to end, and the 'evidence' supplied (by both sides) must have seemed rather silly even in 1947.  But no matter - the fantasy elements are always stirring underneath this ostensibly realistic look at the myth, and I still get a kick out of the last shot.

B002NWRMVS|5.0|Love the CD.  Was pleased with the free CD preview and the free song download.
B001PR0YDA|4.0|Director Robert Zemeckis continues in his fascination with motion capture, delivering both his best-looking and most successful example to date with this umpteenth version of Charles Dickens' 1843 novella.  The technology allows for two major achievements: a spectacular and colorful recreation of early Victorian London with many long takes, swoops and crane shots that are to my eyes more reminiscent of early Disney features in their smoothness and eye for detail than most modern animations; and the playing of multiple roles (all three Ghosts and all ages of Ebenezer Scrooge) by star Jim Carrey and several other cast members.<br /><br />Not being previously an enormous fan of Carrey, nor of the direction Zemeckis has gone in the past couple of decades (though I remain a huge fan of the BACK TO THE FUTURE films and WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT), I can't say that I had the highest of hopes for this, but on the whole both the film and Carrey won me over.  Despite the immense cost and the technological innovation of the thing, this is at heart a fairly conservative and faithful adaptation; little of Dickens' dialogue is changed and all the essentials of the story are kept though, as with every film version I've seen, some segments are shortened and others more drawn out.  The sequence with the Ghost of Christmas Present is kept mostly to focusing on Bob Cratchit and Scrooge's nephew; the following scenes stretch out the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come for a nightmarish chase sequence that for me was the weakest part of the film.  Few concessions are made to the youngest audiences, who probably won't understand a fair amount of what's going on at all times and will be focusing instead on the eye candy filling the screen, of which there is plenty - makeshift toboggan rides down the street, complex multi-layered screen compositions in the \\"Christmas Present\\" sequence, the multitude of ghosts floating outside of Scrooge's window, a shrunken Scrooge being chased like a rat in the \\"Yet to Come\\" scene, etc.  The photography is spectacular, the colors vibrant, the feeling if not Dickensian then at least...different.<br /><br />But ultimately any Christmas Carol rises or falls on the strength of its Scrooge, and Carrey for the most part doesn't disappoint.  He's as nasty and venal in the early scenes as any Scrooge on record, but this film takes more care than many to show just how organic his development from lonely boy to aspiring businessman to bitter recluse has been.  He makes you frustrated, that a man so abused himself, and who has made so many mistakes, can continue down this dark path; a humanized yet nonetheless frightening and truly unpleasant venality.  And his transformation is fairly believable, though I think if more time had been spent with the second ghost, and less on the silly chase with the third it might have been even more cathartic.  The only real problem with him is that at the end he channels the 1951 performance of Alastair Sim - still the best known of all Scrooges - a little too closely I think.  All in all, fine work though, with his plasticine features and serviceable British accent finishing the characterization nicely.  Bob Hoskins and Gary Oldman do fine in multiple roles as well, really there is nothing for me to complain about in terms of the casting.<br /><br />Zemeckis (who also wrote the screenplay) definitely highlights the spiritual themes of the story; there's a striking sequence where the camera pans over a church with the cross very blatantly foregrounded, and the soundtrack choices included several specifically Christian carols.  He doesn't, though, rub the audiences' noses in the religious elements, and this Christmas Carol, is, as it should be, a mix of dark pessimism at the nature of capitalism and greed, mixed with an optimism that man, even a man as desperately hollow and spiritually poor as Scrooge, really does have the capacity to change, and that goodwill towards his fellow man is the real path to salvation - on earth or in whatever heaven one wants to believe in.<br /><br />For me the Brian Desmond Hurst-directed 1951 film with Alastair Sim remains the benchmark for this story, but it's no shame to fall in the shadow of that film, and Zemeckis and Carrey's work, clearly a labor of love just as much as commerce, will take it's place as a classic too, I suspect.ation - on earth or in whatever heaven one wants to believe in.

B002VH7P4O|5.0|This collection is the ultimate version of the Beatles remasters. I also got the stereo and mono boxed sets and I was hesitating on getting this one; after hearing the FLAC files I was convinced that this was an excellent purchase. You can really tell the sound improvement over the old '87 cds (let's be honest, there are some tracks in the remastered cds that sound exactly the same as their '87 counterpart) but with the FLAC files, the music sounds crystal clear (vocals, instruments, everything really sounds great).    If you have the chance go for it!
B002ECJZ76|4.0|Nice story!  It was a little boring for younger kids, but a nice story about how Santa could have come about.  Ultimately leaves you almost like you could believe it to be true!  It is a dubbed movie, just so you know.  The dub is fair, but once you get into the story, you hardly notice.
B002FRNCG0|5.0|I originally bought this book for a good friend of mine.  Shortly after it arrived, I found out she bought it from Best Buy the day it came out so I decided to keep it, having listened to some of their previous work.  I listened to it a few times and I was hooked.  They're no Muse, but Paramore definitely has talent.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|I had the opportunity to see SIR Paul McCartney live a few years back.  I have seen dozens of concerts over the years, Including Tina Turner's final tour and Madonna.  None compared to Paul.  His presence alone as a performer is captivating.  The way he interacts with the audience is so personal that you feel as if you were the only member in the audience and he was playing just for you.<br /><br />As for people that complain about auto-tune on Paul's vocals, Sir Paul is just keeping up with the times.  It is very common for that technique to be used.  Since this performance was going to be released on a DVD and CD, why would they risk imperfections?  Using auto-tune prevented that from happening.  It also made this live CD and DVD set different then his other ones.  I am comparing it to Back In The U.S. which is the one I own.<br /><br />\\"Sing the Changes\\" is an incredible song that Sir Paul dug up from his vast source of unpublished material from the days he was in a band called \\"The Firemen\\".  The song is incredible and to me sounds VAGUELY like U2's Pride (In the name of love) specifically the background vocals singing \\"oh-a-oh-o\\". At least upon listening to it the first time, that was my reaction. But that's Sir Paul, he just pulls one out of his hat and remakes it into a hit.  Well, it already was one, it just went unnoticed. Who knows how many more he has in his vast arsenal of songs written and not yet made into number one's.<br /><br />If you really want to nit pick on concert performances, start slamming Madonna.  She gets on stage and does choreographed dance moves with a bunch of backup dancers while lip synching to her recordings, and performs for only One Hour.  At least that was the impression I got in the case of which I saw her at her last concert tour in Massachusetts.  I admit, she can really dance and the slew of additional dancers made for a nice visual show, but more like a Broadway Musical than a true concert.  Considering his age, like fine wine, he gets better as the years go by.<br /><br />Drink to me, Drink to my health you know I can't drink anymore.....<br />Picasso's equivalent - artist to artist - painter to musician - equal in fame, but for different reasons.ter as the years go by.      Drink to me, Drink to my health you know I can't drink anymore.....  Picasso's equivalent - artist to artist - painter to musician - equal in fame, but for different reasons.
B002KVSJ64|4.0|If you enjoy darker music that you can get lost in, you will adore this album.  My personal favorites are \\"Give Me A Sign,\\" \\"Anthem Of The Angels,\\" and \\"Dear Agony\\" but every track is captivating in its own way.  If you are on the fence about buying this album, just get it, it won't disappoint.
B001RQ0SJO|3.0|I'd like to write a \\"helpful\\" review about this album, but I just don't have a lot to say about it.  Sure, there are a lot of different sounds etc., but that doesn't mean the arrangements are substantial.  The singing is nice and has an unusual tone, but that doesn't make the lyrics good.  This album sounded to me like extraordinarily high-quality elevator music.    ...That said, some of the lyrics ARE rather strong (unfortunately Amazon's little sample of Siren Song cuts out just before the song breaks into its powerful, exciting refrain), and some of the arrangements are too (the catchy, driving song Daniel especially).  Just not enough.    I'm surprised by the connections (mentioned in Amazon's product description) to Bjork, Thom Yorke, and Scott Walker.  A person would be better off buying something by one of those three brilliant singer-songwriters.  But a person could do a lot worse than this, too.
B000063DS1|5.0|To the extent \\"The Last Waltz\\" is praised, the focus tends to be more on the guest performances, and why not?  They are universally (well, nearly universally; Joni Mitchell's set is pretty painful to get through) phenomenal.  Of especial surprise was how much I enjoyed Neil Diamond (widely criticized for being included among the guest list), who turns in a great anthemic performance that--maybe surprisingly--fits with the spirit of the night, and Bob Dylan, who may be a great poet but--this astonishing performance aside--has always had an unbearably grating singing voice.  Here, his voice has just the right timbre (in fact, this is the ONLY vocal performance of Dylan's I like), and he delivers on his whole set, but especially on \\"Forever Young.\\"    Other standouts are, the aforementioned Joni aside, well, everyone!  My favorites are a supremely soulful--and then supremely charged--Van Morrison (best version of \\"Caravan\\" hands down, and his Irish lullaby breaks my heart); the inimitable Muddy Waters; Paul Butterfield wailing his guts out; an appropriately sleazy Dr. John; Neil Young with a little help from a \\"rock\\" of a friend.  Now, granted, having the concert video in my memory improves my listening experience, as I can picture many of these great moments (although what I would give if Marty had captured \\"Tura Lura Lura\\" into the film!).  And, yes, they're still heavily overdubbed, and that's a little deflating to know that these are ideal versions of a concert that actually received mixed reviews at the time.  But so what?  We can still pretend.    Now, here's where I'm going to say something a little controversial: I think \\"The Last Waltz\\" box features the best concert work we have by The Band.  I know there's still a good amount of the concert that's unreleased, and maybe that's a good thing, as word is some of it is pretty dreadful (although, based on the \\"Georgia\\" bootleg I've heard from the show, there's at least some further music from the concert deservinga remaster and official release).  But what we have here works.  To be honest, \\"Rock of Ages\\" and \\"Before the Flood\\" both underwhelmed me.  A lot of the arrangements and performances seemed too busy (\\"Caledonia Mission\\" on ROA), too bizarre (think \\"When You Awake\\" on BTF), too Dylanesque (his typical discordant vocal work on both), or too clunkily funereal (\\"I Shall Be Released\\" on ROA), etc.  This is not to say they're bad albums necessarily, but they're certainly overrated.  But here everything The Band does is spot on.  Again, maybe the issue is just that the compilers were a bit more fussy in what to leave off, as opposed to, e.g., the expanded re-issue of ROA, which added some really unnecessary tracks.    Even the fourth disc of rehearsal tracks is worthwhile as an album to play and enjoy, and not merely as a dieharder's curiosity disc, which we'd listen to once and perhaps find \\"interesting\\" but not actually enjoyable.  Rehearsal versions of Van's two songs are especially good and display a wholly different sort of energy from the live ones.    The Band continued to show moments of brilliance in their post-Robbie reincarnation (e.g., \\"Where I Should Always Be\\" on \\"High on the Hog\\"), but they were generally few and far between.  These four discs show them at the absolute top of their game, and it makes one wonder--as four of the five did...--why the hell they hung it up.
B002PMV9FG|4.0|\\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" was by far the weakest of J.K. Rowling's books, so I didn't have high expectations for the movie. I only hoped that the filmmakers would take this opportunity to correct some of the book's problems with editing and character writing. I wasn't disappointed. Like the book, this film seems more of a segway between Year 5 and Year 7 than an independent adventure. But Harry Potter is not as passive as in the novel, where he seemed to be drained of personality. The students' social lives don't strain credibility, and the scenario is not drowned in filler. There is filler -make no mistake. The film could easily be cut by 40 minutes. But the superfluous scenes give the audience more time to enjoy the wacky wizarding world and to see some familiar characters, so people will probably not complain too much about the length.<br /><br />As Year 6 at Hogwarts begins, menace is in the air. Wizards and muggles alike are terrorized by Voldemort's Death-Eaters. People are disappearing. Hogwarts has taken security measures to protect the students. Headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) has convinced Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) to come out of retirement to teach Potions -or rather he has allowed Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) presence at the school to influence Slughorn, who prides himself on having taught all the most famous wizards and their children. But Dumbledore wants something more from Slughorn, a secret that he believes essential to defeating the Dark Lord. Young Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), meanwhile, sneaks around Hogwarts in a constant state of anxiety on account of a mysterious mission he has been entrusted to carry out for the Dark Lord.<br /><br />Not a lot goes on in the \\"Half-Blood Prince\\". It's primarily a set-up for the finale in Year 7. The pace is slower than usual, but the film manages more suspense than the book. Director David Yates has made it very snowy at Hogwarts for a white-out effect. The palette is appropriately drab as the world teeters on chaos. The book's single strength was the scenes of Voldemort/Tom Riddle's origins and youth. Unfortunately, those receive spare treatment in the film. That's too bad, because we need to know more about Voldemort in order for him to become a full-fledged character before the final showdown. A script for the \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" is tricky, as the book has multiple plot threads that lead nowhere (for the moment). But Voldemort's past could have been integrated without completely losing cohesion. That's the one major flaw in a film that otherwise is an improvement over the book.orld teeters on chaos.

B002R0F3Q2|4.0|There is no honest doubt about Alicia Keys and her craft of making great songs for all universal music lovers. She has shown that as being the one of the most, if not the most influential female singer/songwriter of this decade. She has shown that ability strongly with each and every album she has made all her own. She has recently shown that strongly as a songwriter for other artists, co-writing Million Dollar Bill for Whitney Houston's I Look To You, which went to #1 on the Billboard Dance and Adult R&B charts, and teaming up with Jay-Z with Empire State Of Mind. Well, she is about to show that well on her own again, with her latest effort. But, the time is herefor Alcia to show her true colors again with her Element Of Freedom.<br /><br />Alicia Keys' latest album The Element Of Freedom is a mainly strong R&B album, that tries to expand what has shown to be strong from Alicia's songwriting. Most of that is honestly handled well, but there are a few quirks that aren't strong as they could be. There are a few really strong songs here like the simple Doesn't Mean Anything, and the deep and mending Try Sleeping With A Broken Heart, as well as a few surprises here like the simple How It Feels To Fly, and Empire State Of Mind Part II, which showcases a simpler side from what made her collaboration with Jay-Z, into a song stirring simplisticly all her own, and the strong and intimate Distance And Time. There are a few songs though that don't fit the formula well, like her collaboration with Beyonce' on Put It In A Love Song. It is a mixed bag and unfortunately, both of them don't seem to honestly show a whole lot of chemistry together. It feels like Alicia is trying to gather her own bit from a Beyonce'-like single ladies anthem of her own, and that is something she shouldn't honestly try to put a ring on it.<br /><br />Overall, despite a few faults, The Element Of Freedom is nevertheless a straight-forward and mainly strong set of songs that still shows Alicia Keys isn't just a pretty face, but a strong songwriter whom is expanding her spirits and making strong odes that people will enjoy for generations to come. It also shows a simple ending to a strong decade of hits that a bright star has newly made all her own, and showing that she is definitely the Roberta Flack of the 21st Century. I just hope more great hits keep on coming from Alicia in the next decade to follow.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B 1/2-<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Mastering: B 1/2+<br /><br />Overall: Bface, but a strong songwriter whom is expanding her spirits and making strong odes that people will enjoy for generations to come.

A real classic.
B000ZELISO|3.0|I am so confused! What is this thing - it's in a blu-ray box, but I didn't want a blu-ray disk. I wanted a DVD. The description says that it's a blu-ray/DVD combo. So is it both? It is a Christmas present for someone who doesn't have a blu-ray player. I have bought other DVD's lately that came with a free blu-ray disk just in case you decide to upgrade. I though this was one of those, but now I'm not sure. I don't want to open the box. Can someone tell me what's in the box?

B0012GMXBK|5.0|Accept- This is thier best album. Saw them on tour with Iron Maiden.  This album rocks.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|Ok, I know I made a pretty strong claim in my title, but it's true.  I don't watch TV very often, mainly the Science Channel and other geeky educational channels.  I've seen several decent shows in the past but this takes the cake.  Why?  This show is extremely smart, well written, well directed, well acted, and has very realistic special effects.  If you think this is going to be just another action-packed piece of junk that's just trying to cater to people who want some special effect eye candy, think again.  I have never fallen in love with a show before, but I couldn't help getting emotionally wrapped up in the characters and story line.  The characters are not only complex, but watching the character development unfold is just unbelievable.  This show has left me speechless, in shock with my jaw dropped, and in tears.  A TV show has never made me cry until now.  This show makes you think. Deeply.  It makes you question what being human means.  So if you want a show that you don't have to pay attention to, something that is superficial and mind-numbing, watch Dancing with the Stars.  On the other hand, if you want a show that actually MEANS something and has a point and a purpose, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles is the show!  Just don't turn your head or blink when you watch it because you might miss something ;-)

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The picture quality is really good in this movie as is the sound on blu ray.  Great story and solid action throughout, only movie I ever have and will pay full retail price for. I had to own it the day it came out.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|This is a hilarious movie with characters so warm and real, you can immediately feel yourself a part of their plights.  Normally I wouldn't expect much from a movie chalk full of so many stars, but this is a movie I instantly fell in love with.  If you're a fan of Christmas, this is a \\"must add\\" to your holiday collection.  Watch it year after year...
B001FB55I0|3.0|Movie does well on its own.  The sound on the blu ray is some of the best I've heard, Transformers1-2, Dark Knight, Iron Man, the picture is great but the movie looks a bit drab, it's meant to look like this I assume.  The director's cut is the best way to watch the movie as the original has some poor editing.  Kyle Reese is played well but I did not care for Moon Bloodgood.  Good not Amazing.
0439023491|5.0|I did not think Suzanne Collins could possibly pull off a sequel as good as the original, but she has! I enjoyed \\"Catching Fire\\" even more than \\"The Hunger Games\\".<br /><br />Without including any \\"spoilers\\", I will just say that all of the fascinating elements of the first book return here.  We learn more about the Capitol, and Games system, and the oppression of the Districts.  New characters are compelling; old characters are developed in satisfying ways.  I can't wait for book three in the series!
B002T9H2L0|4.0|and I'm glad I did.  I never do this but this movie had so many good things going for it on paper.  Blu ray looks great and it has some great surround sound.  Christoph Waltz and Pitt are superb in their roles.  Four stars because it drags a little, they could have cut about 5-10 minutes from the bar scene.
0307383415|5.0|This is actually a masterpiece of writing.  If you can put your politics aside, whether Democrat or Republican, and just read it as the marvelous tale that it is, you will be amazed that a young man can take such a route and wind up as the man he has become and with the life he has had.  Every American should read this book.
B002QH2NUA|3.0|Like all of Paul's live CDs the banter between performer and audience is edited out.  Why?  Given that these shows were all in NYC, why not let everyone hear what Paul had to say in the city where American Beatlemania began all those years ago?
015206396X|4.0|I do not know if it's due to the disappointment of \\"Shiver\\", which preceded Graceling in my reading list, that made this book utterly engaging. I just know that I love this book on so many levels. The characters were well thought out and extremely tangible. It's almost as if you know all the characters as a true person. The fighting's were awesome! The romance was not mushy. Kristin gave enough intrigue to keep you reading and hoping. Her descriptive writings were impeccable. Though the overall plot lines were predictable it's the characters that keep you wanting to follow through. This book is akin to the show \\"Heroes\\" where certain people possess special abilities called a \\"Grace\\" which is rare and once known are exploited by their kings for their own benefit. They are marked by developing two different eye colors when their Grace finally surface. The female protagonist, Katsa, is a Graced warrior in her late teens who is brought up and used by her manipulative King Uncle as his henchmen. Through out the book, you will read of Katsa finding herself growing, letting go and breaking free of her oppression to obey her uncles will. That she doesn't have to let him control who she is. By meeting Po who helps her to establish these ideals. She will learn to love and trust. The ending was a disappointment for me because I wanted more of Katsa and Po. It also leaves room for a sequel though Kristin's 2nd novel in the Graceling Trilogy \\"Fire\\" does not continue with their story. I can only hope that at some point she will consider it. This is a fantasy novel that's well worth the read.
B002T9H2LA|4.0|Knowing this was a Quentin Tarantino movie, I expected certain things which he delivered with zeal. On top of that, he rewrote the history of WW2 in a way we only wish could have happened.<br /><br />The movie is full of not laugh out loud, but witty fun, mixed with the trademark cartoonish gory violence. There are spaghetti western scenes, complete with the Ennio Morricone music style, and the dialogue is snappy. However, that is also where I have my problem. The subtitles not only went by too fast much of the time, but they took up too much time in the movie and dragged me away from watching what was happening on screen. At times it was downright annoying.<br /><br />One of my favorite scenes is when Brad Pitt's Aldo tries to fake Italian with his extreme southern drawl. That is the one scene that made me laugh out loud.<br /><br />I also liked the ending, especially for the irony. In real life, even without rewriting history, America did similar things all in the name of fighting communism. Don't know how many other people caught that, but it rings true.<br /><br />Overall, this was a great movie, except for the annoying subtitles. If it hadn't been for them, I would have given it five stars. Still, highly recommended.
0545123267|1.0|This is the first time I've reviewed a book on Amazon.  What more can I say about this book that have not been echoed by previous reviewers that found this book lacking? It was a waste of time. I kept reading hoping that at some point this author will redeem herself but it was too much to hope. I picked up this book based on the rave reviews on Amazon and Visual Bookshelf. I give it 1 star because while the concept was excellent, which lays base for a potentially great Werewolf romance thriller, the execution was amateur and inconsistent! The plot holes, characters or lack of, missing scenes, romance tensions, dialogue, cheesy song lyrics....all incorporated and articulated so poorly! The characters were bland and intangible! She doesn't even delve into the other characters in the story for you to even grasp who they are! It's like everything and everyone surrounding Grace and Sam are just furniture fixture decors so that every once in a while the author can bring them in to distract Grace and Sam's endless time spent with each other. And with Sam on the verge of transforming because of the cold YET he is out and about with Grace. So a couple of werewolves have tried moving to warmer location to escape change only to turn by an A/C breeze from a dept store entrance left open. They become sensitive to the cold?  Really?  No consistency! If you're trying to capitalize on the Twilight frenzy you need to do a better job of it! I hope her writing style and technique improves in her 2nd book (the ending suggests a sequel) but then again it doesn't matter. I won't be reading it and if I do it'll be a library borrowed copy.
B002Q9MZF6|3.0|I agree completely with \\"Roadwarren\\"'s review. The music is sublime but the visuals are at times unwatchable.  The makeup was dreadful, Mimi looked so hard, and what about Villazon's?  He looked sicker than Mimi, at times the dark circles under his eyes made him look like a raccoon!  I did not care for some of the superimposed images used at times,very distracting, to the point that this production did not get me interested until the last act, which was very moving and better staged than the rest of the film.  I have nine other DVDs of La Boheme, and this not one my favorites, that is visually.  For a visually great filmed version of this great opera, watch Karajan's production with Mirella Freni and Gianni Raimondi with production and sets designed by Franco Zeffirelli.

B002QEXN2K|2.0|I'm a HUGE John Mayer fan.  He's that rare killer combo of a great guitarist, an AMAZING lyricist/poet, and a singer with a rough, soft voice that could hypnotize a rabbied lion.  He is truly the Eric Clapton of his/my generation [I'm 30].  I've witnessed the evolution of his work, and admire how his albums are like children: each one is distinctive in tone, yet recognizable as being from the same family.      Unfortunately, this latest release is like the one child is some people's families that, frankly, just isn't that bright.    The songs are so forgettable that I can't even remember the chorus/hook on them, save for \\"All We Ever Do is Say Good-Bye\\", and that's only because the title phrase is repeated about 5 billion times throughout the course of the song.  Talk about repititious!    And Taylor Swift making a random cameo???  Makes about as much sense as U2 doing a track featuring Miley Cyrus.    There are two passably *decent* tracks on this record - the opener, \\"Heartbreak Warfare\\" which sounds like a top-rate, mid-tempo Genesis tune from the peak of Phil Collins' heyday (and I mean that in the most flattering sense), and \\"Assasins\\", in which we catch a brief glimpse of the deep, raw, quiet John that makes an appearance on his other albums.    Though I don't expect any album to be flawless throughout, Mayer can always be counted on to deliver at least 2 or 3 knock-it-outta-the-ball-park classics on each disc.  \\"Daughters\\" and \\"Come Back to Bed\\" (from Heavier Things) and \\"Gravity\\" and \\"Slow Dancing in a Burning Room\\" (from Continuum) are prime examples.  For this reason, John is one of the very few artists who cds I always buy as soon as they come out (even if I haven't heard the first single) becuase the quality of his previous work is so consistently outstanding.  \\"Continuum\\" - which took several listens for me to warm up to - is now one of my favorite records.    \\"Battle Studies\\" is just so invisible and uninteresting that I listen to - and enjoy - the Kris Allen debut disc (that's right - the reigning American Idol champ) infinitely more.  In fact, it pales in comparison. Never in a million years did I think I would like the album from the winner of a reality show more than that of an established, bona fide artist.    My guess is that Mayer either tried too hard or not hard enough on this one.  Or maybe he was too busy dating, then dumping, then dating, then dumping a slew of Hollywood actresses and pop tarts to do what he is more than capable of doing - making stellar work.    I hope his next record is better.  Well, actually, it HAS to be - nowhere to go but up from this one!  [Sorry, John.  I'm still a fan, though.]
B0017CW5J4|3.0|I might give it a 5 star review if I had purchased the DVD version.  The trouble is that I bought the Blu-ray version and its video quality is way below my expectation from a Blu-ray disc.  I wouldn't use it to demo my big screen TV.  Perhaps there are too much strob light flashings on stage and the HD compression couldn't keep up with the rapid picture changes, the video quality is not good at all.  I actually doubt if the concert was shot with HD cameras.      The concert itself is okay.  However, since I already have their Complex Rock Tour DVD, this concert is like 75% repeat of what I have seen on the other DVD.  If I had watched this disc at my friends' place, I wouldn't order my own copy.    However, if you like Blue Man Group and you don't already have their complex rock tour DVD, then it is a more up-to-date version of the concert.

B002SJIO54|5.0|This movie will blow your mind away -- it truly will. \\"District 9\\" is the action movie that Hollywood wants to make, should be making, but doesn't seem to find its way or the formula to do so. It is smart, with little known and unknown actors (at least in the USA), awesome special effects, and very entertaining. Add to this a subliminal message to mankind, delivered in an intelligent way.     The story takes place in Johannesburg, South Africa, presumably during present times. It all begins when a huge spacecraft descends from the sky and stays suspended over the city, without completely landing.  The spaceship doesn't move an inch for a long time, and it appears that it is going to remain like that indefinitely. The people in the city get tired of this situation, and the government sends a crew to get access to the spacecraft. They successfully do so, and, to their surprise, they find a million or so starving aliens inside. They are transported to an aid camp for temporary housing.  However, after a while, the aid camp becomes a permanent housing location. In turn, due to the segregation and lack of resources of its inhabitants, this location slowly becomes a slump. After some time, this slump becomes an inconvenience to the population of Johannesburg, who complain about the nature of the \\"foreigners\\" and the crime wave and additional problems that they generate. A decision is made in which all the extraterrestrials will be relocated to a different location, far from the city. This is an almost impossible task, because the slump has about 1.8 million inhabitants. For this purpose, the government names Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley), a nerdy-looking employee of MVV (the agency that handles the extraterrestrials) to be in charge of the relocation. At first, Wikus, with the aid of the military, seems to be handling the assignment really well. However, many unexpected problems arise which will determine not only the future of our planet, but Wikus' personal life as well.    Ably directed by Neill Blomkamp, who has a strong background in animation and visual effects, and produced by maverick Peter Jackson, \\"District 9\\" is an unexpected surprise that will captivate you from beginning to end. It is fun and fast, honest and smart, penetrating to the end. Sharlto Copley shines in his role, and I can bet you that there will be a new installment of this very fascinating saga. The 2-disc DVD set includes deleted scenes, commentary by the director, a filmmaker's log, several making-of segments, and much, much, more.

B000KX0IOA|5.0|A compelling story of an underappreciated, extraordinary leader, who led the struggle of his nation against British colonialism, beautifully presented. The life of a man of peace, who was assassinated by individuals who abhorred peace; it's a story that is endlessly repeated.<br /><br />This is a great movie about the life of a great man performed by an outstanding actor!
0091922348|5.0|I learned about this ccokbook from a friend who had lived in London for several years. I was enchanted by the stories of the two owners. And then I started to read the recipes. The ingredients and combination of flavors sounded amazing! So I borrowed the cook book, made fennel gratin, cauliflower fritters with lime yogurt dipping sauce and honey cilantro lamb chops. Every recipe produced delicious food! Needless-to-say I quickly purchased my own copy and look forward to cooking my way through the rest of the book.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|I bought both the stereo and mono sets and all I have to say is: phenomenal. I don't understand all that technical language that the other reviews describe, but as a simple Beatles fan, the sound is great and very clean. I wasn't fortunate enough to grow up in the era where music was available in records, but owning the \\"other\\" cd's, there is a very notable difference in the sound with these sets. The ONLY thing I regret is buying these sets too fast and not waiting long enough to buy the Beatles usb! According to the reviews of the lucky owners, the sound quality is superb. Oh well! Going back to these sets, it was well worth my money.

B000P0J0EW|1.0|This movie was a very bad influence for my daughter. She doesn't get out much so we keep her stocked on movies to watch while my husband and i are \\"busy\\". We had bought this film the moment it came out on DVD, and she was very ecstatic. Now i know why! We found that she had slowly chiseled away in our basement and covered it up with her hannah montana posters. Silly girl!
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|Solid Album! I did not skip through any tracks on this one. I must say that this album is one of her best yet. Alicia Keys proves again that great music doesn't need unnecessary swearing or conforming to current trends, but takes her creativity to another level on this one.
0465011047|4.0|This is a well written, first person account of life of a North Korean (DPRK) boy who grew up as the son of ethnic Koreans who moved to North Korea from Japan after World War II.  The boy's grandfather makes an unknown mistake and the entire family is condemned to life at Yodok - a DPRK re-education or work camp.  The grim stories of this young man struggling to survive and while surrounded by death and suffering gives the reader a first hand account of North Korean-style communism.<br /><br />The author, since his escape, has studied and become a journalist in South Korea, writing for the Choson Ilbo newspaper.  You can find some fragments of this book in a few of his articles.<br /><br />I recommend this book for readers, students, and researchers interested in North Korea, human rights, communist ideology, history, or government.  It may also be of interest to ethnic Koreans living outside Korea to understand the conditions of life in North Korea.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|It's hard to believe, but I feel this is the best Star Trek ever.  Story is great, acting great, special effects great.  I found nothing to complain about.  If these folks redid all the first weekly Star Trek TV shows, they could bring in a whole new generation of fans.    Have watched it 2 times and will again.  I almost never watch a movie more than once.
B002VECM40|5.0|The story takes us on the journey of this monstrously mistreated young female from near destruction at the hands of her violent, hyper-narcissistic mother (Mo'Nique) and her rapist father (who has impregnated her twice by age 16) to a rescue with the help of a frayed but still somewhat viable network of dedicated social workers who help her gain literacy and independence from her wicked elders.    Interspersed with the depressing realities of ghetto life is the constant flow of Precious's glamorous daydreams, the little fires generated by her undying spark of life, her only opening toward beauty and light, imagining herself wrapped in beautiful gowns, doted on by handsome men, cheered by adoring crowds on the red carpet; wealth, fame, as she knows them from the pop culture that is her only mental nourishment. For her mother and for herself, life is an endless round of TV-food-arguments-TV-food-arguments. In their dark and dingy apartment, practically the only illumination is from the TV screen.    Mo'Nique's performance is revelatory on multiple levels, down to the bone of the human condition and certainly up to the highest screen standards. It is bravura work. Sibide's performance is technically masterful but much of her effectiveness comes from her imposing physical presence; this is not meant to detract one iota from her acting skills - it is just a fact. The excellent supporting performances include a pleasing turn from singer Mariah Carey as a down-to-earth social worker with a playful personality; it's an inventive characterization. But the whole cast excels and they should be honored for great ensemble work, especially the young ladies in the special education classroom.    Flaws? The pacing seems to slow down unnecessarily toward the end and Precious's educational progression seems a bit confused and not completely fleshed out, but this is minor stuff. This is a very inspired work of art by someone with a fresh vision. It is not preaching morals or slogans,just revealing truth.
B002OEBMN4|4.0|I've been a rabid Slayer fan ever since \\"Hell Awaits\\" was released.  I am also a huge fan of great hardcore/\\"punk\\" bands, esp. Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, Husker Du, and Minor Threat, etc., which far exceeded the originality, experimentation, and heart which was long gone in rock music when they all surfaced.  Slayer took the aggression of these bands, mixed it with the power of metal and helped create thrash which was crystallized to perfection when \\"Reign in Blood\\" hit the market.  I also appreciate Metallica, but as far as metal, speed metal, and thrash metal goes I listen to very little else.  These two bands are without doubt the most creative and innovative bands that came from this era.  Of course Metallica became virtually un-listenable after 1991's \\"Metallica\\" came out.  Slayer, on the other hand continued on with dependable, albeit less inspiring, albums sounding still like what most love about Slayer.    When Dave Lombardo left the band, Slayer lost something.  \\"Divine Intervention\\" sounds a bit too mechanical and dry, but to give the album credit it was not an attempted rehash of former Slayer glory.  \\"Diablolus\\" to me was a vast improvement maybe more due to its production.  \\"God Hates Us All\\" was a fantastic feat with great sound and great songs.  Does everyone remember that this album was released on 9/11/2001?  Quite eerie.  This album reinforced the fact that Slayer still had no peers.    When \\"Christ Illusion\\" was released I had high hopes due to the return of Lombardo and the long wait since the previous release.  I was completely let down.  I've listened to it many times and some of it has grown on me, but overall the disappointment remains.  I can't help but hear too many reused Slayer cliches which are fine in small amounts, but a band has to keep growing to remain vital and listenable.    So I had very low expectations for \\"World Painted Blood\\".  One of the reasons is the title of the album itself which sounds too familiar, in a bad way.  But it's the music that matters and this is why this album is better than \\"Christ Illusion\\".  \\"Beauty Through Order\\" highlights this album for me.  It shows again that playing fast and loud 100% of the time defeats the purpose.  There must be build up, sinister slowness and heaviness to complement the speed.  The song \\"Raining Blood\\" is an early example of this.  \\"Reign in Blood\\" would be much less of an album without the beginning section when the speed of the album just dies before the final climax.    \\"World Painted Blood\\" does seem to have too many songs and sections where it sort of feels like a cut and paste of various parts of \\"Reign in Blood\\" and \\"Hell Awaits\\".  I love these albums, but when I want to hear them I listen to them.  I want to hear Slayers new ideas.  Again...I know you can still play fast, probably faster than you ever did, but there's much more to Slayer than speed.   I don't need the constant reminders which seem thrown in just for that purpose.  I prefer new ideas and creativity over exercises in speed.    I hope Slayer continues to record, and personally I wish they would actually lay off so many ultra fast songs at this point.  They have nothing to prove and I'm sure they know it.  But I'm not asking for a \\"South of Heaven\\" rehash because it wouldn't come close.    As an album this one rates a 8/10 simply because what else out there nowadays can compete?  So any Slayer fan should give it a chance.  As for a Slayer album it rates lower, better than \\"Christ\\" and \\"Show No Mercy\\", but maybe 3/10.  As far as the production that many seem to be complaining about I must be missing something because that is not an issue for me.

B002NXSRX4|4.0|Loaded with action and Special effects, a real hoot to watch!  I did not see much differance with the blue ray version though.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|BBM is a true masterpiece; I loved it.  This widescreen 2-disc collector's edition is worth watching again & again.  The bonus features are so good.  This film effected me so much; I can't get it out of my mind.  I always cry each time I see it.  Love is universal - the story is so full of loss, mistakes, regrets, sadness, etc.- that it makes your heart break.  The performances of Heath (sigh) as Ennis and Jake as Jack, along of course w/Ang Lee's masterful direction, are terrific.  The screenplay by Mr. McMurtry and Ms. Ossana is perfect.  The fact of Ennis & Jack not being together effects their entire lives, as well as the lives around them.  All in all, what a great film!!    P.S.: That so-called \\"academy\\" robbed BBM of best picture of 2005; it is unbelievable that award went so undeservingly to something like \\"Trash\\"!  The audible, unbelievable gasp of the audience must have been heard outside the theater!  Wouldn't surprise me if it was just a cave in at the last minute. Stupid cowards.  But, I admit that I never fail to be amazed and furious at all of that \\"academy's\\" continuous mistakes from way back.  Heath was definitely robbed of best actor, as Jake was of best supporting actor,.  The beautiful cinematography was not rewarded also.  Some things never change...
1565117700|4.0|Virtuoso performance by Gary Sinise. I am a teacher and use it in class.  However, I  would have preferred a more detailed cue system.  I could find chapters with a little practice but exact counts would have been nice.  Other than that, a  great unabridged rendition.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I am not a Star Trek fan, but really enjoyed this movie.  I loved the action and there was not too much romance in it.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|I cannot believe the 3rd disc is included almost like just a bonus.   This one itself can be sold as a DVD for the live.   I love and appreciate the band's true performance, no gimmick or tapes there. Instead it's almost like their own recordings for each song.   To me it's like an \\"Unplugged\\" shot but at the much larger place with much more audiences.  Paul packed all the songs and stories of Beatles' and his solo completely. This set is more than money can buy.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is her first cd, and I only heard \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" on a big internet site.  It exceeded my listening pleasure.  Certainly was great in my car's cd so even my husband thought she has an easy, awesome voice. I rarely buy cd's,& I'm so glad I did.
0061474355|2.0|Ooh I feel like such a mean person rating this only 2 stars. I really thought I would like it what with all the 4 and 5 star reviews but it just didn't capture me at all!<br /><br />The main thing was the characters. I feel like I never got to know Sabriel at all! She was just this empty husk given a mission by Garth Nix to get from point A (her school) to point B (where her dad's body lies.) On the way she picks up 2 more \\"people.\\" The first is a cat named Mogget, except he's not a cat, he's a... well nobody knows what he is but apparently his job is to be the servant of all the Abhorsens WHICH IS WEIRD since Sabriel has never met him before and since he is her dad's (the Abhorsen's) servant and she lived with her dad for the 1st 5 years of her life and got constant visits from him, YOU'D THINK she'd run across Mogget or at least hear about him once or twice? I guess not.<br /><br />The next person turns out to be her love interest. Of course, he's a prince. Their romance felt so forced and awkward, i just kind of ignored it. i can't even really say anything about it, it was literally like Garth Nix sat them down and said 'okay guys, i need you to be in love with each other now.'<br /><br />The world and setting was really great. The death stuff was really interesting and well thought out, but what is a fantastic world without fantastic characters to inhabit it?<br /><br />I'm going to give the next book a shot b/c i heard it's supposed to be better than this one. i'm really hoping it is...<br /><br />edit-<br />Dec 20 - i'm halfway through Lirael and i like it A LOT. it will probably be getting 4 stars from me!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I enjoyed this movie, mainly because even through all the twisted violence and insane action it truly was a story of the human condition, and we won. Very entertaining.

B001HIJYR4|5.0|An anxious, clumsy and abused office clerk Wesley Allan Gibson has a hell and boring routine life: his obese boss humiliates him all the time and his girlfriend betrays him with his colleague and best friend during working period. When he meets the sexy Fox, Wesley is informed that his father was a professional killer that belonged to an ancient organization called Fraternity and killed by the skilled and powerful Cross, a hit-man that has betrayed the Fraternity. Wesley learns that his anxiety actually is a manifestation of his latent abilities and he joins the society under the command of Sloan. Trained by Fox, he changes his personality and attitude, being prepared to face the dangerous Cross and find a hidden secret. Wanted was by far one of the very best action movies for 2008. It was a very fun wild ride from start to finish. It had many twists, turns, gore, blood, and action. Just strap in and get ready for a roller coaster ride of your life.
1439157383|1.0|I hated this book.  Yes, I meant hate.  Poor, poor ending.  The writing and concept towards the end of the book & especially the last chapter is unbelievable.  No, really...it is not to be believed.  It is not well thought out, there are so many errors in the thought process that you can not make the leap to the ending.    I feel like the author did not know how to end the book and grasped at staws and came up with this lame, unbelievable ending.  The facts don't jive.  If it is a stretch at a metaphor, it is poorly executed.

0765322889|5.0|I discovered Steven Erikson's Gardens Of The Moon by reading his newest publication, Bauchelain and Korbal Broach. I am glad the Malazan Series is alive and well!<br /><br />Gardens has multiple rich characters, countries, situations, actions, and peoples. Some characters in conflict end up resolving and continuing forward. Some characters die their just deserts. There is more than one hero to identify with in this story!<br /><br />Gardens is as action rich and bloody as Joe Abercrombie, though not as idea rich as L.E. Modesitt. Garden's core ideas are along the lines of, everything's temporary in the long run but that doesn't mean you shouldn't pick a direction and stick to it. Those who surrender their identity tend to lose out; those who find themselves tend to win through.<br /><br />This review is not telling the story so much as sharing what I like most in fiction: Engaging, Intriguing, and Unpredictable in a GOOD way.
B000XA5K4I|5.0|Mr. Smith, a gun-toting badass with a hair trigger and an unknown past. He's far from a doctor and farther from a parent, but when he unwittingly discovers an innocent woman delivering a baby right in the middle of a gunfight, Smith enters the fray to save her and though the woman expires, he is the one left in care of the orphaned child. He thinks that the killers were after the woman, but soon he realizes that they had a far more unlikely target: the baby. Smith's regular company is a seedy underworld full of unsavory characters, so he takes the child to the closest thing he knows to a mother: a sultry prostitute. This movie is pure action fun - not much in the way of literary devices, no insight, no meaningful pauses. It is meant to be one thing - an adrenaline rush. But to enjoy it to the fullest, you must suspend reality and just take it in as it comes. It will be gory, it will be fantastic, it will be on orgy of bullets, but most importantly, it will bring you to the edge of your seat. So watch this movie, but watch it at face value, a beautifully straightforward action movie.
0743497465|3.0|The 1st half of the book even the first 2/3 are great, but by that time you know how the story is going to pan out and there's little reason to keep reading.  It became difficult to finish the last 150 pages or so.

B002L5GQGY|5.0|To get this out of the way, I don't rate musical concerts 5 stars willy nilly. I own more than 60 concerts on DVD because my favorite thing to do on my days off when the wife's at work and my son is at daycare for his 3 hours is to take the volume of my AVM20 to around -14 db and listen to good music. SACD and DVD-audio have a place in my collection, but there's nothing like watching a good performance when the musicians are on fire and the performance is excellent.<br /><br />This is one of those concerts where the band was there to play a great concert for the fans, and they accomplished.<br /><br />From listening to the brief background documentary on Joe at the beginning of both discs (A nice touch, and not overdone), it has been Joe's dream to play the Royal Albert Hall for many years. This is a venue where many greats in music have played to countless thousands of audience members. Joe stands tall among those great players (Clapton, Pink Floyd, Tangerine Dream, Zepplin, and countless others.), and he certainly serves up one heck of a performance.<br /><br />Joe is a fantastic player, and wholey underappreciated on the music scene. Born, I believe, the same hear as Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Joe is one of a small handful of prodigy guitar players that have been popular over the last decade, but two differences are evident: Joe Bonamassa isn't a household name like the others, but Joe will be playing for audiences for the foreseable future because he is simply a spectacular performer and the fans want to hear him play.<br /><br />You've heard Johnny Lang and Kenny Wayne Shepherd on the radio, but have you heard Joe on the local airwaves? Amazingly the answer for me was 'no', and in my opinion as a musician myself, he is a better player than both Jonny and Kenny. I guess his agent just doesn't have the same connections, or that Joe's desire is simply to perform at his best playing the songs he wants to perform, instead of selling-out to a record label.<br /><br />Youwon't typically find a Joe Bonamassa cd or DVD at your local Best Buy, and this is a shame. I only heard of him through Amazon because his style is similar to other bands I enjoy. I can't thank the little \\"Customers who bought this item also bought\\" banner on Amazon enough. It has turned me on to a lot of music and musicians that I would have otherwise not heard.<br /><br />If you're a fan of blues and great guitar playing, don't pass up this DVD. Here's hoping I can see Joe play live in the next couple of years. In the meantime, when I need a fix of great music I'll put Joe Bonamassa Live From Royal Albert Hall in the DVD player and turn the volume up to concert levels. Simply Great stuff.<br /><br />A player who is already a legend to his fans, and who will be a legend to the masses when enough of his fans tell other's about his talent as a musician. Count me as one of his newest fans.....<br /><br />Update: Still the go to DVD concert for a lot of my get-togethers. I've now seen Joe in concert twice. It only makes me like this DVD that much more. I only wish that he would release footage of his acoustic improv!
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|I did not expect the live version could be this good.  It shows how good the killers are.  The band performance,   in my opinion, is better than the recorded version.  The video transfer is great and the sound is awesome.  It is a must own.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|This album is quite different from Alicia's previous work, but in a very good way. I think she has (once again) done an incredible job of delivering superior music. Some favourites that stand out are \\"Love is Blind\\" and \\"Wait Till You See Me Smile\\" - both are beautiful tracks with very unique sounding melodies. This cd makes the slow and agonizing drive home in endless traffic very worthwhile! =)
B002M9FWQE|3.0|The debut album from Mika, [[ASIN:B000NA2776 Life in Cartoon Motion]], was a splashy, colorful explosion of sugar pop that seemed to go to the top of every chart except the American ones. Mika himself is a chameleonic music swirl, parts Freddy Mercury, George Michael/Wham! and Elton John, capable of extreme catchiness yet artistically delirious at once. He's a guilty pleasure with bonus nutrients.<br /><br />His sophomore album, the more seriously titled \\"The Boy Who Knew Too Much,\\" races headlong down the same candy-land trail, but hints at a more tart center beneath all the frosting. The irresistible \\"Rain\\" makes you tap your dancing foot while asking if he should be happy. You'd be hard pressed to notice, because Mika is the kind of songwriter for whom over-the-top is a limit to be conquered as many times as possible. \\"Blame It On The Girls\\" and \\"We Are Golden\\" (the first two singles) are so flamboyantly effervescent that they'd make Mercury proud or at least make you wonder if Mika should just chuck it all and cover A-Ha's [[ASIN:B0006FX2PO Take On Me]] and be done with it.<br /><br />It's only on the song \\"Blue Eyes\\" that Mika finally tones it down a bit, moving into the kind of pop Paul Simon perfected with [[ASIN:B0002EQ7E2 Graceland]]. That song is indicative of why the album only rates as three stars; after awhile, there's only so much sweetness you can ingest before insulin shock starts to settle in. Mika proves again here that he can sling impeccable pop melodies with effortless ease, but \\"Blue Eyes\\" makes me wonder how much he could accomplish if he held back on the Andrew Lloyd Weber and maybe took some time studying up on the Paul McCartney.

B001PE26QQ|5.0|For any fans of martial arts, this is a must have!  This film seems to have flown below the radar, and I'm unsure how it never got a theatrical release in the United States.  I was fortunate enough to first see it as part a special movie-marathon in a local theater.  Ip Man was one of the most talked-about films of the night (and there were some amazing films that night).  I strongly encourage anyone who loves martial arts to watch this.      Based on a true story, there is a very human element and depth of character that is often lacking in action-packed movies.  Donnie Yen's portrayal of the famous Ip Man is flawless.  But do not fear, there are plenty of fight sequences that are thoroughly entertaining for those that just want to see people kick some butt.      If you're shopping for a gift for anyone into Asian action films, you really can't go wrong with this one.  It has a little of everything.  Sure to please.
0812971825|5.0|If I had to compare Strout to another author, William Maxwell comes to mind. Abide with Me, like Strout's other two novels, is complex in nature, deeply provocative, and emotionally wrenching - and rendered in the most beautiful prose imaginable. There are pettiness, envy, jealousy, lust, sorrow, grief here, as well as an enviably articulate examination of questions of religious belief, compassion and love. Every major character is fully realized and compassionately drawn. There are no one-dimensional cardboard people here. Minister-protagonist Tyler Caskey and the parishioners of his small flock will stay with you for a long time after you put this book down. Perhaps one of the most compelling statements in this narrative comes late in the story, when one of Tyler's former teachers counsels him, saying: \\"No one, to my knowledge, has figured out the secret to love. We love imperfectly, Tyler. We all do. Even Jesus wrestled with that ... I suspect the most we can hope for, and it's no small hope, is that we never give up, that we never stop giving ourselves permission to try to love and receive love.\\"<br />Because Abide with Me is in the end, perhaps more than anything else, about love. I cannot emphasize enough that this is simply a beautiful novel. Beautiful. - Tim Bazzett, author of PINHEAD: A LOVE STORY

B0013LL2Z2|5.0|I had seen this movie in theater on release and wanted to add it to my film library.<br /><br />It represents the flawed thinking that leads to too much control over personal life and that people will believe whatever they \\"need to\\" believe.<br /><br />Though, by today's standards, light on special effects it is an entertaining flic.
0679746323|4.0|Very enlightening book about a horrific period of history.    Mao was certainly looking out for himself and no one else.  Every page of the book builds up the case for 'Mao the Monster.'  But this left me uncertain about how such a person could climb to power.  Did he have any redeeming feature, personal charisma etc that could account for his rise?  This would help us prevent future Maolings from rising again.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I bought the DVD version because everyone on amazon was complaining about the Blu-Ray version being sub-par in terms of the video quality. The DVD version has good quality footage; video quality is good so far (I have seen about 2 and a half DVDs) and the narration by Attenborough is good. Also, this DVD set indeed has the \\"behind the scenes\\" footage which supposedly the Blu-Ray version does not have. Overall, great product, good for a gift and great price too!
B001ED7C58|5.0|I bought this soundtrack for my daughter, but I liked it so much, it stays in my car!
B0019LY5IM|4.0|I pre-ordered this months ago and while watching the show I had to check the box and see if I ordered blu-ray...which I didn't.  I thought I did cos the quality is excellent.<br />Wish there was a booklet inside explaining about each episode. For this money there should be something.<br />Personally I love the relationship between Sawyer and Juliette. Sawyer really does seem different by not pissing people off all the time and not so self centered.  It is like this relationship changed him.  God I love this show.
0385504225|2.0|I really enjoyed Angels & Demons, as well as the Da Vinci Code.  I do not mind that his writing style lacks any sense of style or complexity.  However, while reading this book, at times I felt like Dan Brown was hammering me over the head with his points.  I won't spoil anything - but one twist involving the villains past - is so heavily telegraphed that I didn't need to wait until 300 pages later for it to be revealed.  Further, the fast pace of Dan Brown's previous books is completely lost here.  The book meanders in history lectures for long segments - and they completely interrupt the pacing.  The one saving grace of this book - the information about Washington DC is fascinating.  Dan Brown knows how to conduct research and I learned a lot about where I live.  So to summarize, here's the basic weaknesses and strengths of this book        Thrill Level:   Weak - The final \\"secret\\" is disappointing and I never really much cared about the mystery because it seemed too far-fetched.  Langdon acts like a big wet blanked throughout the story - insisting that the legend is false.  And another problem - the impending \\"disaster\\" that the villain plans to concoct - when that was revealed I felt cheated - because it was quite tame.  Worse things happen during one episode of \\"24\\" than this \\"disaster.\\"        Background Facts:  Strong - Dan Brown weaves together an interesting portait of Washington's secrets, geography, and history.  His information about the secret societies was interesting as well - however it truly felt silly to read about \\"Noetic science\\" as if it were something were a serious discipline.        Length:  Weak - As others have indicated, whoever Dan Brown hired as his editor should be ashamed of him/herself.  This book was entirely too long, with whole chapters that felt unnecessary.  For example, the first 80 pages seemed to be an extended prologue, in order to introduce each character, and \\"noetic science\\".  And the final 60 pages seems to drone on for far too long.  And in the middle, we are given far too much background story on Solomon's past.  Brown seems to think his readers are quite stupid, and that each character's past needs to be hammered over & over again.        Characters:  Medium - Langdon doesn't seem to be as active as a character in this book.  He solves a few puzzles here and there, but much of the book is devoted to following the villain and a couple side characters.  The villain is comically evil, but that's okay because it builds on the mystery of his motivation.  The standard Dan Brown \\"beautiful but brilliant woman\\" serves her purpose as expected, though the character is fairly superficial.        Puzzles:  Strong - The puzzles that Langdon does solve along the way are interesting, and they stimulate the reader to continue along to find the solutions.  However as stated previously, the last solution is so blaise that the journey feels anticlimatic.    Overall, the book is a mess.  It has some promise if someone could eliminate about 200 pages from it - however even without those 200 pages there are still inherent weaknesses.  I recommend spending your time on a different book.  Pick up a book on the masonic history of DC and you'll get the best of what this book offers.
B002KREVCO|5.0|Crabsody in blue?  This is a great historical review of some seldom (or never) heard studio tracks, covering most of their lead singers over the years and a nice video to boot.  Typically great grinding guitar work by the young brothers makes AC/DC a stand out hard rock band, and this is a lively and entertaining box that is worth every cent you pay for it.  This is not just their greatest hits over and over again like so many other packages, there are classically humorous Bonn Scott pieces like \\"Crabsody in Blue\\" and Austrailian release versions of songs you probably will never hear anyplace else.  Try it, you'll like it.  At least I did.

0439023483|5.0|As I have mentioned before, I am often found reading the forums on [...]. I also keep up with my Google Reader - all of the bloggers and readers in both places raved and raved about The Hunger Games. I did not know the plot summary or anything about the author. I did not know it was part of a series. I did not know when the book came out. Basically? I knew nothing except that everyone loved it.<br /><br />I decided that maybe I should read this one, so I put myself on the hold list at the library. I wait several weeks, and find out it's on an inter library loan and was due weeks ago - which means it's probably not coming back anytime soon. I posted this on a Paperbackswap forum while I was talking about what I was reading at the time, and one of the members on there generously offered to read both The Hunger Games and Catching Fire (the sequel) and send them to me!<br /><br />YAAAAAYYYYY!!<br /><br />As soon as they came in the mail, I started to read. Luckily, I had originally planned on having a lot of time to read that weekend.<br /><br />It took approximately one page to suck me in. Collins does a great job of telling the story while making sure you have enough information - and there really are a lot of things you have to learn. If you skipped over the plot summary above, you should go back and read it - it does a better job of explaining what goes on in the book than what I could. The characters are ones that you connect to, and the events that happen are so unexpected you find yourself wondering what's going to happen over and over again. One of my favorite parts is that everything doesn't just happen for the good of things - just because you start liking a character does not mean that everything will go the best way for that person, which makes it a very intense read.<br /><br />I ended up liking it so much I immediately recommended it to my fiance, and he read it all in one day - he loved it too. My recommendation is that you get your hands on a copy of this book!<br /><br />Book Cover: 9/10<br />Book Title: 9/10<br />Plot: 10/10<br />Characters: 10/10<br />Ending: 9/10<br /><br />Overall: 10/109/10  Plot: 10/10  Characters: 10/10  Ending: 9/10    Overall: 10/10
B00127RAJY|5.0|As Jillian says in the workout, if you want to loose weight just working out 20 minutes you have to really push and make it intense for that time frame. And she's right, she pushes you but what I like about it is, IT IS doable for everyone. I'm no stranger to working out to DVDs at home with a stack of things I've tried from Pilates to I Want That Body, Powerjam etc. I have also done a P90X with Tony Horton and loved it but it takes up to a 2 hr and at least 1hr (you can split am/pm workout times) but I changed jobs recently and unless I get up at 4AM, which is hard after you get home late exhausted from patient care all day and then who wants to work out at 9PM, possibly jepardizing getting to sleep at a decent time, it's tough and your motivation goes down when you weigh in the pros/cons.     Loosing weight takes commitment but so far, I'm about a week into Jillian's 30 day Shred and I'm impressed all around, but impressed with the results. Jeans are getting looser! What I find difficult is getting back into working out after taking a break for whatever reason you get into a lull and then get motivated again. I slacked off completely the last few months from all but 30 min uphill on the treadmill and it just wasn't cutting it as I'm getting ready for a beach vacation in less than 2 months and  was having a hard time getting back into my P90X routine.  I saw I could try this DVD out on Netflix and thought what the hell? why not? and so now I bought 3 from Amazon, one for myself and others as gifts.    What sold me is, I hate that soreness you get where then you have to usually take a day since you can hardly walk to recover. I didn't have that as intensely and I continued to work out even though I was a bit sore and it resolved by day 3 and I really felt my endurance go up. I really liked that and that is mainly due in part to the time frame, it's just right really. She mixes cardio with strength and she'll tell you that IS the fastest way to get the best results in the shortest amount of time. And it goes by fast.    It's intense to a degree but like I said, not terribly difficult but effective moves and you do (within days) start to transform but give it all you got like she says. I found if you work thru the soreness (do the modified moves she gives if you need to) it'll resolve. A lot quicker than a 50 minute upper body routine followed with another 45 minute workout from Tony would just starting out. (I do love Tony though!)     I turn into Biggest Loser from time to time and she can come off as a scary but drama for TV is a lot of it I feel, and I do like her attitude towards working out and committing to it and not being a baby about it, and you just have to push thru to that last rep. Dig deep people! Come on it's 20 minutes?! And it works! Highly recommended if you are not sure what to start with of her series, I also ordered the trouble zones since she got me curious from this DVD...have yet to delve into that workout.
B002LITRTO|3.0|I was able to pick this one up at my library after several tries, after reading about the series on another blog. I am a sucker for series, and since there are several in this one, I thought I should at least give them a try (even though my library only has the first one).<br /><br />In the beginning of the book, I was getting very frustrated with how snobby the girls were. All of the situations they had gotten themselves in were annoying to me, because they are all things I would never do and they all thought they were perfectly okay.<br /><br />After we learn about the girls and what they have been doing in high school, the mystery of \\"A\\" is brought in - I will admit I had no idea where that was going. Some of the statements from \\"A\\" are silly, but it did turn the end of the book around for me - I am actually interested to see how the mystery is solved.<br /><br />While I probably won't rush out to get the next books in the series (I do have Catching Fire to read, after all), I wouldn't mind getting the rest of them one way or another. I have a feeling the other books in the series will go over better with me, because I think the girls may start to learn some lessons.<br /><br />Book Cover: 7/10<br />Book Title: 9/10<br />Plot: 7/10<br />Characters: 6/10<br />Ending: 7/10<br /><br />Overall: 7/10
B000YRY8BG|5.0|I discovered the BBC series (from Amazon reviews) only after watching the Hollywood film, which pales in comparison. In fact, the BBC series, \\"State of Play,\\" was so good that I  sat for 360 minutes watching it in its entirety. As suspenseful as it is well acted, this intelligent political thriller had me riveted to my television set, to such an extent that I could think of doing nothing else until the plot with all its complex twists unfolded to its conclusion. I can hardly wait to play the commentaries of episodes one and six (but not tonight--or rather, this morning).<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the performances of John Simm as the persistent, but conflicted, investigative reporter; Bill Nighy in his inimitable persona as the crusty managing editor; and James McAvoy as the son, whom Nighy deigns to hire as long as the young man uses his mother's maiden name. All the characters were well developed and one came to care about them (although the Member of Parliament at the center of the budding scandal, was cast in what I think was a thankless role in that he emerged as a bit of a whiner).<br /><br />The BBC has provided English subtitles, so that not a word of the fast-paced script will be missed.<br /><br />I recommend this engrossing suspense yarn for anyone who likes to be kept on the edge of one's seat for six hours that will seem to fly by.
0307593525|5.0|Having been a long time fan of French cooking, rustic or otherwise, I got interested in learning to cook the French way. This book is indespinsible. It has everything a person needs to know in order to cook some really delicious foods. I can't wait to try out all of the recipes!
B002HWUU1I|5.0|I have been a huge fan of The Swell Season (and Glen Hansard's other band The Frames) after seeing Once last year.  Strict Joy is a slightly different album than the Once soundtrack, but its a fantastic follow-up.  Whereas Once seems to permeate the beginnings of Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova's (now ended) romantic relationship, Strict Joy clearly explores their break-up and the challenges of being together.  For that reason, it seems a more somber album.    The live CD and DVD are nice bonuses.  Well worth the purchase!

B000DWMN2S|5.0|Can a movie find hope in the ashes of the Holocaust?  Miraculously, this one does, and with a lot less schmaltz than you might imagine possible.   How does it do this?   By giving us characters so vivid and memorable that their very presence suggests the indomitable spirit of life.   By making us laugh, cry, and  stare in wonder at sights and sounds which have the ring of truth, even if the film itself is wrought out of the colors of magical hyper-realism.     A great deal of credit of course accrues to the novel.  But Liev Schreiber proves here that he understands how film can cut straight to the funny bone-- and to the heart.   And he seems to have an almost unerring sense of when to do what.       A dazzling, moving, stirring debut film.   The only rub is this: when it was released by Warner Independent, nobody saw it.    Something is clearly wrong with a) how films are being distributed in America b) the American public, or (and most likely) c) both.

B001AVCFK6|4.0|Special effects galore. If you are a tried and treky you may not like this movie much. The charter traits have been changed a little, get ready to be surprised if you haven't seen it yet. I enjoyed the film very much, finding the changes refreshing.
B001FB55HQ|3.0|It's saving grace is that it did have a plot and it did sync up pretty well with the other 3 Terminator movies, but it could have been so much better, especially with an actor like Christian Bale staring in it.  I've really enjoyed all of his movies and tried so hard to like this one as well.  It was filled with CGI, most of it fair to bad as well as goofy things that no human could ever survival, like a helocast from a pretty decent altitude at a high rate of speed that John Conner performed and didn't even get wet in the process.  The plot was overcast by almost non-stop action in an apparent attempt to hide it, which is a real shame, as the plot is a noble one.  The ending was unsurprising as well.  Of course we all know that John Conner has to survive or the other movies in the franchise wouldn't make sense, but there was only one surprise to the whole thing and that card should have been played closer to the end so that boredom wouldn't set in before it thankfully came to an end.
0452289963|1.0|This book was weak, uninteresting and disappointing.  The writing is juvenile and repetitive and the book should probably be 60% shorter.  He says we \\"humans are on the verge of creating a new world by a personal transformation that shifts our attention away from our ever-expanding egos.\\"  Please.  This guy was on the verge of not having a book to release so his income could get back to expanding after the 2004 success of \\"The Power Is Now.\\"  Try that one first.<br /><br />I never read that one.  \\"A New Earth\\" made me question whether Tolle could have *ever* had anything interesting to say.  I was recommended this by a friend who is now on my 'ineligible to recommend books' list.  At least I didn't buy the thing...
0143038419|2.0|As others have said before me, a well-written book (mostly) by an intensely self-centered woman.  I feel so sorry for the rest of the world that this is the type of American women that they all must think we are.  Selfishly indulgent, Gilbert made me totally sympathetic to her husband whom she divorced.  Why?  Even though she had a wonderful job, lived in a wonderful home, her husband was ready to start a family.  For this she found herself having a breakdown on the floor of her bathroom in the middle of the night?  Marriage counseling not an option?<br /><br />The book is worth reading for the world tour.  But don't buy it.  Get it from your library.
B002JCMZA0|4.0|Ms Krall can make ordinary music, but not this time. This is a jewel of a CD. It is so smooth and soft that like little cat's feet it creeps up on you. You'll play it behind a romantic evening and find that instead of making your Big Move you're listening to Diana. Then, unless your resolve is strong you find that you leave that treat sitting by herself on the love seat while you step over to the stereo to turn the sound up. No, this is better enjoyed in the privacy of your own home, without distractions like real, live girls or potent liqours. It won't knock you on your backside like The Girl in the Other Room, but it will get you there if you've the soul to go. I don't have to tell you to run out and buy, Diana Krall does okay without my plug, but go out and buy, it will make staying at home this Christmas seem like the smart thing to do.
B00003CXCQ|1.0|The delivery was VERY fast. We got the DVD about a week before they expected. However, it was NOT \\"new\\". There were no security sealings on the case which leads me to assume that it was opened. The wrapping on the case was not the original wrapping that comes on DVDs. It was a shrink wrap just like the kind we use at our college bookstore to wrap bundled textbooks. THEN, when we watched the movie, it constantly had a black box in the corner with a video camera picture in it. The box that usually comes on when you've copied from a DVD incorrectly. This was NOT a satisfying purchase. Be VERY careful when ordering this DVD.
B000W21H8U|5.0|This is one Tom Waits album I come back to time-and-time again, usually on a cold dark winter's night.  It takes a long time to grow on you and I don't recommend it to those new to Tom Waits (stick with \\"Rain Dogs\\").  This is the kind of music I imagine the dwarf from Twin Peaks getting down to in the Black Lodge.  It is like stumbling through the dark streets of an empty town or riding a creepy fairground ride.  The songs roll into eachother really well and create a dark yet fun atmosphere.  Several tracks have a strong Ennio Morricone influence to them as well (check the closing of \\"Blow Wind Blow\\" & the whole of \\"Yesterday is Here\\").  Check out some of Tom's live performances of these songs over on YouTube to get more of a flavour for them.  This is one of those records you have to listen to from start to finish.  Just what is needed in today's plastic pop world of X-Factor and Pop Idol.
B001OQCV2O|4.0|2012<br /><br />STARRING: John Cusack, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Oliver Platt, Amanda Peet, Thandie Newton, Thomas McCarthy, Danny Glover, Liam James, Morgan Lily and Woody Harrelson<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Roland Emmerich and Harold Kloser<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Roland Emmerich<br /><br />Rated: PG - 13<br />Genre: Action<br />Release Date: 13 November 2009<br /><br />If there was ever a sucker for a movie full of stuff being destroyed, it's me baby. I've been a huge fan of writer and director Roland Emmerich's, aka `The Master of Disaster', ever since he blew up the White House in Independence Day. Godzilla was amazing, The Day After Tomorrow was terrific and without a doubt his greatest film of all was The Patriot. You know that awesome flick with Mel Gibson that couldn't be any different from the three films I just named previously; yeah, that one. Same dude directed it.<br /><br />So what did I think of 2012? I only have two complaints about the film. I wanted more stuff getting blown to hell and I wanted more John Cusack. Other than that, it was great.<br /><br />But that's just because I'm such a dork for disaster in films and an insanely huge fan of Mr. Cusack. The movie is good and most people will be more than satisfied. You will definitely get your money's worth, at well over two hours of our beloved planet meeting its demise.<br /><br />\\"You've been warned\\", the tagline screams to us. And that we have. We have been warned for God only knows how many years by the Mayans, that on the 21st of December in 2012, Earth will be no more. This is a fact in the film and in life (that we have been warned, not that it will happen).<br /><br />It is also a fact, based on the research I have gathered from the internet, that on the 21st day of December in 2012, the sun will be perfectly positioned in a way that only happens every so however many thousands of years and that there will be `some' side effects on earth.<br /><br />Scientists do not necessarily say that the world will end, but that there will be a polar shift of sorts. Take that for what it's worth to you. Do I think that the world will end on that day? No, I do not. There are way too many movies to be made about the end of the world and I can't wait to hear the rumor of the next date in which the earth will end. Can you?<br /><br />In the film, we learn early on that scientists have discovered a situation involving our sun, in 2009; that situation being the end of the world, of course. Then we move pretty quickly through 2010 and 2011 until we arrive in late 2012.<br /><br />The government immediately set a plan in action, back in 2009; their plan? They will charge the wealthiest people in the world a hefty price for a seat on one of many expensive ships that will travel them to safety. The price one must pay for life after 2012, should they be able to afford it; one Billion Euros. This money of course is all paid in advance and is used to construct the massive ships. Oh, and the government isn't releasing any of this to the press either.<br /><br />I have heard a lot of people complain about the over-use of comedy in the film. I didn't find there to be too much but I did not enjoy the stab at Arnold Schwarzenegger. It was too cheesy to be funny; the guy sounded nothing like Arnold. It put a bad taste in my mouth mid-movie, due to its poor placement as far as pace is concerned. And I'm not sure if they were trying to be funny, but when they show the Mona Lisa painting, it's about four times larger than the actual painting in real life. Maybe no-one working on the set that day had ever been to the Louvre.<br /><br />Like in so many of Emmerich's films, there is a single father with a lot of personal issues to deal with throughout the course of the film; all while battling whatever catastrophic event is occurring simultaneously. This time his name is Jackson Curtis and he is played by the brilliant John Cusack.<br /><br />Jackson is a writer slash limo driver. He has the kidsfor the weekend as is taking them from their home in Manhattan Beach California to Yellowstone National Park to go camping. He's recently separated from his wife Kate (Amanda Peet) who now lives with her goofball boyfriend who's a rich doctor. Is it starting to feel like a big Hollywood movie yet?<br /><br />When they get to Yellowstone they run into the wild and crazy disc-jockey Charlie, played beautifully by none other than Woody Harrelson. Woody goes all out here. He embodies every clich&eacute; and stereotype of the American anti-government hippie, save for a joint in his hand surprisingly enough. He really looks off his rocker here. Having seen him recently in Management and Zombieland, I can tell you that he lost a lot of weight to play this government-paranoid whack-job.<br /><br />Woody's character Charlie fills Jackson and us in on his wild conspiracy theory; both through a series of uncontrolled obnoxious fits of paranoia and a half-baked homemade video he has downloaded to his computer.<br /><br />Meanwhile back in California and elsewhere in the world, things start heating up. Mom panics and demands Jackson bring the kids home early.<br /><br />He does and then heads off to work. One of his clients is a rich Russian who bought several tickets to one of the ships. Jackson is dropping off the man's kids at the airport and this business with `the only way to survive being on one of these ships' is explained very quickly to him and then just like that, he is convinced that Charlie was onto something.<br /><br />I struggled with the reality of this for about a second and then I let the amazing action that followed, take all useless demands for plot point believability and erase them from my brain.<br /><br />Jackson barely has time to rescue his family from their home before the entire greater Los Angeles area begins to crumble to dust.<br /><br />I thought that Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was a shoe-in for the Oscar for special effects this year. However, 2012 will definitely be giving it a run for its money. This entire sequence will leave you breathless. The special effects during their escape of L.A. are astonishing; probably the best I have ever seen. No one could have made it any more believable without it actually being real. Just when you think there couldn't possibly be any more, there is; lots more. Emmerich just keeps hammering the disaster down our throats.<br /><br />From there it just keeps getting worse; Las Vegas - gone; Washington D.C - done; The Vatican in Rome - not anymore. Emmerich doesn't just show you the end of the world; he makes sure you live through it with his characters. It was an absolute blast!<br /><br /> As if all of this action and mayhem wasn't enough, you actually get very good acting sprinkled through it as well.<br /><br />Danny Glover is the U.S. President and Oliver Platt is his right hand man; two knock-out performances. Thandie Newton is Danny Glover's daughter and she did a great job too.<br /><br />Next to Cusack, the best acting in the film goes to the much underrated Chiwetel Ejiofor. This guy is going places with his career. He was incredible and has such a kind spirit about him. He's the smart scientist named Adrian, who figures out most of what's going on and has to deliver the news to the President.<br /><br />I Know I have commented on the action repeatedly, but towards the end of the movie - it just stops. There is no huge action-filled climax. The end is entertaining, don't get me wrong, but it plays out much more like a thriller than a disaster flick. It just seemed to drag on way too long for me and before I knew it, the movie was over. In my opinion, the climax was seeing L.A. being taken out.one National Park to go camping. He's recently separated from his wife Kate (Amanda Peet) who now lives with her goofball boyfriend who's a rich doctor. Is it starting to feel like a big Hollywood movie yet?

Danny Glover is the U.S. President and Oliver Platt is his right hand man; two knock-out performances. Thandie Newton is Danny Glover's daughter and she did a great job too.      Next to Cusack, the best acting in the film goes to the much underrated Chiwetel Ejiofor. This guy is going places with his career. He was incredible and has such a kind spirit about him. He's the smart scientist named Adrian, who figures out most of what's going on and has to deliver the news to the President.      I Know I have commented on the action repeatedly, but towards the end of the movie - it just stops. There is no huge action-filled climax. The end is entertaining, don't get me wrong, but it plays out much more like a thriller than a disaster flick. It just seemed to drag on way too long for me and before I knew it, the movie was over. In my opinion, the climax was seeing L.A. being taken out.

B002VKE0XA|5.0|PARANORMAL ACTIVITY<br /><br />STARRING: Katie Featherston, Micah Sloat and Mark Fredrichs<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Oren Peli<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Oren Peli<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Horror<br />Release Date: 16 October 2009<br /><br />Several movie advertisements have used this line for years and I have never found it to be even remotely true until now; so I'm going to use it: Paranormal Activity is the scariest film since The Exorcist. There, I've finally been able to use it!<br /><br />Now that I have your attention, let me save half of you the three minutes that it will take you to finish reading this review and the roughly 90 it'll save you from actually watching the film. If you hated The Blair Witch Project because you thought it was stupid, then you will inevitably despise this film as well. There. See how nice of a guy I am? Now you can spend those 90 minutes doing something you enjoy.<br /><br />For those of you still reading, I will take it that you appreciated the brilliant and unique style of The Blair Witch Project, as did I. You will most likely love this film as well.<br /><br />The Blair Witch Project clearly inspired this film, as it has others and was a slightly better film. But Paranormal Activity is easily 10 times more frightening.<br /><br />I'm told its entire budget was just 15 thousand dollars and it has already grossed over 100 million dollars at the box office.<br /><br />NO; regardless of what you have heard, the film is not real. Neither was The Blair Witch Project or Quarantine or The Fourth Kind.<br /><br />The film looks and feels real though, and that's why it's so terrifying. We are lead to believe that it is `found footage' by the police and that for whatever reason, they are allowing it to be released in theaters nation-wide.<br /><br />The entire thing is shot with a home video camera, operated completely by the two main characters: Katie and Micah. They're a couple with a little more than a lump in the mattress causing problems in their relationship; a demon to be exact.<br /><br />We learn in the first few minutes that for several nights they have witnessed strange `paranormal activity' occurring while they sleep. Micah buys the video camera and explains this to us as we meet Katie when she pulls up in their driveway. We follow them back into the house and with the exception of a scene in the backyard; we never leave the home again for the remainder of the film.<br /><br />It is soon revealed that Katie has been haunted by this demonic spirit for several years, no matter where she goes. They agree to set up the video camera in their bedroom in hopes of capturing evidence of such said `paranormal activity'.<br /><br />That's when it gets creepy. The camera is positioned in the same place every night and a little time dial lets us know what time it is. Every time you see the camera positioned in the corner of the room like that, you know it's about to get scary. And it does, trust me.<br /><br />At first we just hear noises. Then the door moves all by itself. Then we start to see shadows and that's all I'm going to tell you.<br /><br />This is not one of those movies that you will think is just so-so. You will either love it or you will hate it. You will either find it incredibly horrifying; leaving to your imagination what is causing all of this to happen or you will be completely irritated at how lame it is.<br /><br />I think it is much more fun to leave it up to your imagination what the demon looks like. Yes; I know that it is just a guy downstairs making noise and turning on lights and what have you. But it's freaking scary in the movie! You let your mind believe that it's a demon and that's what makes it so fun.<br /><br />The actors don't seem like actors. They feel like real people being themselves on a reality show. When the events begin to take a toll on them and they become scared, you believe that they are going through this for real. (Not literally; I mean you believetheir acting performances. It's a movie people; that's all).<br /><br />The only reason it's not a prefect film, is that just like in any horror movie; the characters do stupid things. Especially Micah.<br /><br />You will want to strangle him by the end of the film. He is constantly being a testosterone-driven moron and challenging the demon; thus making it angrier.<br /><br />Also, why didn't they ever leave the house? It's explained by a paranormal expert that leaving won't help anything but it's very obvious this is only in the movie because they wanted an excuse to be able to continue shooting in the same location.<br /><br />When the paranormal expert won't help them due to the overwhelming evil presence in the house, why couldn't they have called in someone else? I'm sure he wasn't the only one around.<br /><br />Regardless if you get slightly annoyed by this towards the end of the film like I did, they make it up to you in the last 20 minutes or so. Most of the film drags on and I can see how it can be boring. But trust me, if you can make it to the end you will be more than satisfied!<br /><br />It is truly disturbing. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Every time they go to bed and you see the little time dial, it's like listening to the tick tack of a roller coaster climbing to the top of the track; you know that something awful but exciting lies just ahead and you can't help but cringe and your heart is racing.<br /><br />I know the film is fake but I am still amazed at how they were able to pull off some of the events that take place. There are no wires folks; there are no obvious bad computer graphics either. The filmmakers took their 15 grand and spent it very wisely. I'm glad to have given them my money. It was the best 7 bucks I've spent to be scared in a very long time.or movie; the characters do stupid things. Especially Micah.     You will want to strangle him by the end of the film.

B000VD5I94|4.0|3.8 stars<br /><br />One of the worst blu-ray transfers I've seen, barely distinguishable from the dvd version. Lacking the Criterion version's extended cut, the blu-ray offers nothing at all besides the film, and a dull, grainy transfer. You just know they did it on purpose to sell a bigger version later. Pathetic.<br /><br />Too bad, as this is one of the best 80s sci-fi flicks, with many good points, and some bad. The bad includes the pointless gore; the violence is in the story but the gore is all Verhoeven's, and for me adds little and detracts much. But the good includes a very sharp script, excellent set design, and in general the feel of a B-movie with A-movie production values. The acting is mostly pretty poor, with the exception of the bad guys, who are all solid. Verhoeven was clearly not an actors' director and didn't know how to get their best work. Too bad, as this script could easily have been delivered better.<br /><br />But the strengths here overwhlem the flaws, as this vision of the future has become ever closer to reality in the last 22 years, as we contract out control of our prison system and much of law enforcement to evil corporations like Blackwater (now calle Xe; like Phillip Morriss is now Altria, etc. Corporate rule: kill as many people as you can, then change your name, rinse and repeat). The overall tone of this movie, and its message, are spot-on, and if it weren't for the overly lush carnage Robocop would be almost perfect in its way.<br /><br />Nowhere near the quality of true genre classics like Blade Runner or Gattaca, Robocop is nonetheless one of the better sci-fi flicks of the last few decades, and deserved better than this greedy, shoddy blu-ray treatment.<br /><br />Save your money until they get it right.

B000TGCR38|5.0|I had caught this movie near the end on one of the cable stations and was completely captivated by it.  So I purchased the movie and was not dissatisfied.  Someone wrote the translation was bad; however, not knowing Dutch and reading the English translation, it's hard to see that something was lost.  Someone else wrote the scenes were a bit \\"cartoonish.\\"  I guess it could be seen that way in some places, but I think when you're living in a time when you don't know from one minute to the next if you'll die (not many people were exempt from this situation you know) you tend to do things you normally wouldn't do.<br /><br />I also don't think any of the sexual scenes were in any extremes either.  If you think any scenes were extreme, I suggest you go to a Holocaust museum or purchase dvd's showing the real films of German soldiers killing people young and old without batting an eye, and knowing that people were experimented on because they were Jewish, gay or gypsies.  To then gripe about sex scenes seems trivial.<br /><br />This is a great movie, showing a different side of horrific times.
B002QEXN2K|4.0|If you're expecting to hear the same type of album as his earlier ones, you might be disappointed. I too am a huge fan of JM's previous albums- I have every one in my cd player in my car including this one; but this new one is vastly different from the others. It is more mellow in a lot of ways but the lyrical content and melodies are absolutely stunning. JM has always been a fantastic writer but his talent is even more obvious here. I have only had the CD a few days but having listened to it pretty much the whole way through I have to say that number 1 and number 6 are my favorites but I also love Edge of Desire. If you open yourself up to the idea that this CD is a completely new endeavor you will NOT be disappointed at all. I was a little apprehensive at first but after a few listens you will love this cd as much as previous ones.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|This is essential for any Beatles fan. The Stereo remixing has been cleverly done.  Albums like Abbey Road, Sgt Peppers and the White Album sound like modern master pieces. Their gems like \\"A Day in the Life\\" and \\"I am the Walrus\\" sound even amazing. Ballads such as \\"She's Leaving Home\\" and \\"Hey Jude\\" give goosebumps. George Harrisons guitar shines better than ever and you can even pick up banter between band members on some tracks. Love it.....
1442192461|5.0|\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.<br /><br />After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.<br /><br />At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.<br /><br />Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.<br /><br />And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).<br /><br />Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").<br /><br />Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.<br /><br />\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings.

B000Z27HLS|4.0|Gothic romances were all the rage in the late 1700s and early 1800s -- and Jane Austen deviated from her usual form for \\"Northanger Abbey,\\" a mellow satire of the genre. And \\"Masterpiece Theatre: Northanger Abbey\\" manages to translate it well into a movie, with what seems to be gothic fantasies and scheming set in the middle of a sunlit English countryside.<br /><br />Catherine Morland is an innocent young country girl with a love of gothic romances, and has lives an unremarkably life in a country parish. But then the wealthy Allens invite her to Bath during their vacation there, and of course she accepts -- and through balls and old acquaintances, she becomes friends with two pairs of siblings. One is the Thorpes, the uncouth dandy John and his manipulative sister Isabella, and the more mysterious Tilneys, the charming Henry and sweet Eleanor.<br /><br />When the Tilneys decide to leave Bath, Catherine is invited with them, to the vast stone manorhouse of Northanger Abbey -- which is as gloomy, eerie and remote as her gothic-loving heart could wish for. What's more, she believes that there are dangerous secrets in Northanger Abbey, related to the suspicious death of the late Mrs. Tilney. But Catherine has some lessons to learn about reality and fantasy: that everyday world is not nearly as melodramatic and twisted as her novels, and that it has its own dangers and deceptions.<br /><br />\\"Masterpiece Theatre: Northanger Abbey\\" does an admirable job of adapting Austen's novel, evenly balancing out its two sides -- on one hand it's a parody of all the lurid excesses of classic gothic novels, and on the other it's a subtle coming-of-age tale about a young girl who needs to figure out the difference between reality and fantasy. It has some eerie moments, but most of them seem to be fantasies of Catherine's -- lots of sword fights and dungeons, with her trailing around in a big white gown.<br /><br />It's also beautifully filmed, with ivy-drenched cottages, vast stone castles, grassy yards surrounded by lush trees, and even the pale-lit streets of Bath. It's a stark contrast to the dark, gloomy world that Catherine imagines. And the writers translate Austen's stately prose very well, with some clever dialogue (\\"Now I must give you one smirk, then we can be rational again\\") and some beautifully romantic moments as well (\\"I told him that I felt myself bound to you, by honor, by affection, and by a love so strong that nothing he could do could deter me...\\").<br /><br />It also has some very solid casting -- Felicity Jones projects wide-eyed innocence as Catherine, and she's just pretty enough to be striking without being too much so. JJ Feild is deliciously sexy and just a bit impish as Henry Tilney, and Catherine Walker has a brief but well-acted stint as Isabella, who may be the most naive, clumsy gold-digger in the world. There are also some excellent performances by Catherine Walker (as the gentle, conflicted Eleanor), Liam Cunningham, and William Beck.<br /><br />\\"Masterpiece Theatre: Northanger Abbey\\" is a beautifully filmed, well-acted adaptation of Jane Austen's gently satirical classic, and preserves its spirit admirably.

0930289234|4.0|Watchmen  - The Novel!<br /><br />First off, I did not like the movie.  Don't be a squealing 12 year old 'Twilight' girl and get over it!<br /><br />I will start with a jumping off point: The movie adaptation by director Zack Snyder.<br /><br />There were several film reviews I've read that I think fit the bill.<br /><br />I go to Roger Ebert as I like his reviews and most of his opinions jive with mine.  The other is Entertainment Weekly which looks at films from the entertainment industry professional view (IMHO).<br /><br />Ebert says:  \\"Another bold exercise in the liberation of the superhero movie. It's a compelling visceral film -- sound, images and characters combined into a decidedly odd visual experience that evokes the feel of a graphic novel. It seems charged from within by its power as a fable; we sense it's not interested in a plot so much as with the dilemma of functioning in a world losing hope.\\" -- Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times<br /><br />And Entertainment Weekly says:  \\"Even 'Watchmen' fanatics may be doomed to a disappointment that results from trying to stay this faithful to a comic book. The opening-credit sequence has a marvelous audacity ... [but] once the film proper begins, Snyder, who did such a terrific job of adapting the solemn Olympian war porn of '300,' treats each image with the same stuffy hermetic reverence. He doesn't move the camera or let the scenes breathe. He crams the film with bits and pieces, trapping his actors like bugs wriggling in the frame.\\" -- Owen Gleiberman, Entertainment Weekly<br /><br />Now is it possible they could both be right?  Is this an odd visual experience?  Or is Snyder so reverent to the original novel that he does not let the \\"scenes breathe\\"?<br /><br />Ah, the book!<br /><br />Watchmen is a Hugo Award winner and one of Time Magazine's best 100 novels list.  Alan Moore, author of such classics as V for Vendetta and The Killing Joke (both books of which I loved) churned out The Watchmen, a 12 issue miniseries by DC Comics back in the 1980s.  I won't rehash the entire plot here, just to say it's an anti-hero story; heroes who started out great and then came to their end under the suppressive thumb of the US government run by Nixon and the Cold War with the USSR is an ongoing background problem.<br /><br />The art by Gibbons is freshly done; character's bodies are not overly done; the blood & guts is not too graphic, but just enough for you to feel the horror of the moment.  The child murderer who gets his dogs mutilated by Rorschach is such a scene:  Red on red, man screams, cannot say anything else but \\"Oh God, Oh God!\\"  Quite a scene.<br /><br />The articles between the scenes adds depth to the story that you cannot get from the film.  Not at all.  Excerpts from \\"Under the Hood\\" where Hollis Madison discusses \\"the trauma of the 1950s and the emergence of the new super-heroes.\\"  Hector Godfrey's article from The New Frontiersman gives us some radical writing with such subcaptions as \\"Coked-Out Commie Cowards\\"!  Articles like this give the reader the mood, the suspense and then we dive into the characters and their travails in this unabiding world.<br /><br />And finally, probing into the character's lives really brought them to life and made them real for me.  The \\"Probe Profile\\" on Sally Jupiter as she discusses her rape from The Comedian.  The psych file from the Rorschach.  The origin story of Dr. Manhattan.<br /><br />The book gets a solid four stars from me.  It's entertaining, great art and writing and the articles between the issues gives greater depth than what one normally sees in the typical comic book.  League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, another vehicle by Moore, attempts this too, but not to as successful degree.<br /><br />Read them up!<br /><br />Check these items on Amazon:<br /><br />[[ASIN:1848560419 Watching the Watchmen: The Definitive Companion to the Ultimate Graphic Novel]]<br />[[ASIN:B002G7E0K6 Watchmen Doomsday Clock Black T-Shirt Adult]]<br />[[ASIN:B001FB55H6 Watchmen (Director's Cut + BD-Live) [Blu-ray]]]<br />[[ASIN:B001QTWC0K Watchmen: Tales of the Black Freighter & Under the Hood]]br />[[ASIN:B001FB55H6 Watchmen (Director's Cut + BD-Live) [Blu-ray]]]<br />[[ASIN:B001QTWC0K Watchmen: Tales of the Black Freighter & Under the Hood]]

They saw the VHS and asked what that was, they never saw one...they only saw CD's.   They loved the movie and want to come over all the time to watch it.  I bought this for Christmas for them, they didn't get it yet, I am excited to have them have their own.  Now I can go another generation of Annie.

0743243153|5.0|30 years later, the author's words are crisp and newly insightful.  It's an existential world.  You are responsible for your life.  The stories help to understand what you can do to become more self-aware.  The road requires courage and a willingness to engage the next level of challenge time after time, in spite of ....  The alternative is death, duplicity, falling, confusion, naive stories, simplistic religion, simplistic rationality, vanilla ecumenicism, puddly relativism.  In essence, this is Kierkegaard's leap a century later.  What do you know?  What will you do?  How will you know?  In spite of uncertainty, what will you do?  What do you think now?  Peck provided us with a gift that everyone can read and understand.  Like the Meatloaf song, \\"what's it gonna be boy, yes or no?\\"  We are all faced with an existentialist challenge.  This is a GREAT place to start the journey. Only if you have the courage.
B001NMAFXQ|5.0|Ok, so this CD wasn't as hardcore as For Those Who Have Heart, but it's still really good. A Day To Remember has really come a long way, and this album really shows that. There are two things that make this album their best so far. The first is the more honest tone it has than the other albums. I mean, the others are good for blowing off some steam because of the vicious lyrics in 1958, Heartless, and Speak of the Devil. But after nearly five years of touring, the band is bound to be homesick. Jeremy showed that with this record, and actually wrote from his heart. The second thing that makes this record the best is that the band's also trying to show you that screaming's not the only thing they know how to do. The screams in the songs that have it are really good, but it's also nice to hear Jeremy's voice just as a regular. Bands that just scream kind of get old after awhile, and it's nice to hear a change in tone. I'd highly recommend this, especially if you like songs you can realte to.

0143038419|5.0|Ordeed a paperback book for an amazingly low price and in great condition. Received the book in a timely manner with a little note to enjoy.  Can't imagine why I would pay full price for books again.  Would order from here again.
B000ECX0QU|4.0|I liked this movie a lot.  \\"Topaz\\" is based upon the Leon Uris novel of the same title, and I consider that novel to be perhaps Uris' finest work.  While the movie does not quite measure up to the excellence of the novel, it makes a brave attempt to do so.  This is an engrossing and realistic film about the Cuban Missile Crisis and retains its relevance today.  Without giving away too much, the story revolves around a French espionage agent who supplies vital intelligence information about the Soviet missile buildup in Cuba.  This film is multidimensional, with engrossing characters, a solid storyline, and historical relevance.  Not to be missed.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  RJB.
B000RZGFYS|1.0|People buy this album not knowing what it is? If star ratings are pretty points; this album gets just one. The only question for someone who bought this and couldn't stand it would be: What the hell were you listening to in the mid eighties?....and regarding the satanism ~ please: They are mercenaries; filling a hole.
B0026P3G12|5.0|As soon as she opened her mouth, I HAD to pre-order this one. What a gift! Crank it up and let her passion take you away! WOW.
B000148KK2|5.0|Reading some of these negative reviews, I must disagree.  I guess this is one of those love-or-hate albums.    For me, this album is my favourite album, by any artist, by far.    I keep coming back to it every so often and always enjoy the sheer musicality, the moods, the honest acoustic feel, the lyrics, etc.    It is also my reference record when I try out new speakers, new home theatre components, etc. as I find that this quality acoustic/jazz/blues/vocal music can be very revealing for sub-standard equipment.    No, this may not necessarily be a very accessible album, especially if all you are looking for is smooth elevator-music-like jazz.  I think this album is for serious listening and solitary contemplation & enjoyment.  It may reward you richly if you go to it without being hung up on her previous repertoire.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Very well done, macabrely entertaining documentary.  Food, Inc. kept me riveted as it explored all of the major corporate-power foods--poultry, beef, corn and soy.  Because this was my first exposure to MANY details about these industries, the information shocked, appalled and saddened me.  But this is just the wake-up call that our increasingly obese nation needs.  This is not a  \\"conspiracy theory\\" documentary, though I've heard it called this.  It is simply a documentary about the damage wrought on our food industry by big business supplying exactly what America demands--cheap, abundant food.  For anyone who watches this and leaves it feeling that no food available is fit to eat, I recommend reading (or listening on audio) to Barbara Kingsolver's Animal, Vegetable, Miracle.  She offers beautiful, encouraging advice about how we can start to make a difference, at least in our own bodies and communities, by growing and/or buying LOCAL, ORGANIC foods whenever possible--and she entertains marvelously while she makes her case.    And trust me, once you see Food, Inc., she won't have to sell the idea very hard.
B0029O08WA|5.0|Absolutely love it!  Number 2, 4, and 10 are my favourites.  Really brings back scenes from the movie.  Can't stop playing it!
0061537969|4.0|A very special story that speaks to us all.  Enzo, a dog, tells the story about his life with his \\"soul mate\\" Denny.  Along the way, Enzo and Denny share many universal life lessons.  Enzo has such wisdom; he truly knows how to look ahead and read the road through the twists and turns that life gives us.  I've had to buy 5 copies, because I keep giving them away.
0385504225|1.0|Up until now I have been a fan of Dan Brown's.  I usually read nonfiction and technical books, but every once in a while pick up a novel.  It is rare for me to give up on a book I have started, but last night on p.73 I found that I could not tolerate another paragraph of \\"Lost Symbol.\\"  How many times do we have to read about how brilliant and famous the characters are?   How these elite people know or learn about deep dark hidden secrets that the unwashed masses are seemingly incapable of understanding.  How clever and classless and free the main characters are? (Borrowed part of  that sentence from Lennon).  I think I will vomit if I ever hear the words metasystems or Noetics again (apologies to anyone who shares this sentiment).
0812550706|5.0|I've had a recent streak of intense sci-fi interest.  First Out of the Silent Planet, then 1984, then Fahrenheit 451--and now, thanks to a friend, I have been led to this literary treasure: Ender's Game.      There are a lot of detailed reviews, so I won't go into detail.  In short: this book is brilliant.  It's just great.  The author has mastered tension and the insight into human psychology is just ridiculously good.  Be forewarned that, although this is mostly about children, that it is NOT a children's fiction.  In fact, there is a good amount of foil language and other comments, as well as violence, which may not be suited for a child under 13 or 14.  This is, believe it or not, perfect for adults.  (On a side note: The next book in the series deal with adults.)
B0019HQIFE|5.0|I have been a John Mayer fan for a while, so this was one of the first Blu-ray music concerts I bought. I was pleasantly surprised by the separate solo, trio, and full band segments to this concert, and the quality of the audio and video are excellent. The way the interviews with John are handled are nicely done and interspersed well.    In summary, this is a great concert and a reference quality music Blu-ray.    PS. Other reviewers have commented that the ladies will love it, but when I first put it on my wife's reaction was that's the sleazebag who sleeps with all the Hollywood celebrities!
B001C4CI8A|5.0|The story and action looks so realistic in this Blue-ray movie, its a great buy for my collection.
B001U9BRNE|3.0|I bought this Blu-ray pretty much based on all the wonderful reviews here at Amazon. On firing it up in my Oppo blu-ray player with B&W speaker setup, I was instantly impressed with the quality of both the audio and video. Even in dark scenes, sharpness and clarity are excellent. It's simply one of the best music concert recordings I've seen.    I also really enjoyed some of the performances.    Now for the reason I have since sold this on Ebay. When the credits rolled, I just didn't see myself wanting to watch it again. The concert itself was recorded in Las Vegas and feels very \\"showy\\". It feels almost like the whole thing has been done to feed David Foster's ego on how great he is to have produced these artists. And showing low-res video clips like the Bodyguard mid-concert, please..     If however you like the artists and don't mind a slightly cheesy Las Vegas show, this Blu-ray won't disappoint.
B002I9Z8B2|2.0|I wish I had paid attention to these reviews a little closer because I would not have ordered this knowing it was NOT the Director's Cut.

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I have to admit there are two reasons I took an immediate personal liking to Pixar's 2009 sure-fire contribution to the box office, the Emeryville studio's impressive computer-generated artistry reflecting the most dependable cash cow in the industry. The first is the unique casting of an Asian lead character, a cherubic, hyper-curious nine-year-old Japanese-American Wilderness Explorer stowaway named Russell. The second is the reference to Fenton's Creamery, which is a two-minute walk from my former home in Oakland. Beyond those two points is a surprisingly mature, sometimes melancholy comedy adventure that focuses on a 78-year-old protagonist whose self-proclaimed destiny is to visit a mythical place that he and his wife have dreamed about ever since they first met. Before the kids start moaning, you should also be aware that there are more than enough exotic animals, talking dogs, acts of aerial derring-do, and miscellaneous Indiana Jones-type thrills to counterbalance the film's more sentimental moments.<br /><br />Co-directed and scripted by Bob Peterson and Pete Docter, the movie opens during the Great Depression when a young, shy boy named Carl Fredricksen meets tomboyish Ellie in an abandoned house that she has turned into a clubhouse. They discover they are both aspiring adventurers who dream of meeting intrepid explorer Charles F. Muntz and going to Paradise Falls in South America. An impressively executed montage follows as we watch Carl and Ellie grow up, get married, and grow old together. When Ellie passes away, Carl becomes a solitary curmudgeon unwilling to sell his home, which is the same house where he met Ellie, amid the high-rises being built all around him. An unexpected altercation occurs after a construction worker accidentally knocks over Carl's mailbox. Forced to move into a retirement home, he hatches a plan to tie thousands of helium-filled balloons (a dazzling effect) to his house and float away to Paradise Falls. What he doesn't count on is the appearance of Russell on his porch early in the flight, and together, they face a series of adventures involving a large flightless bird in iridescent colors searching for her chicks, a lovable golden retriever named Dug who expresses his thoughts by way of a voice-activating collar, and Muntz himself, who has become a Captain Nemo-like figure deep in the jungle with his massive zeppelin.<br /><br />There is a refreshing emotional economy to the story. That's why the 96-minute film doesn't feel as ambitious as [[ASIN:B000VBJEEG Ratatouille]] or last year's [[ASIN:B0013FSL3E Wall-E]], but at the same time, there is a deeper emotional resonance in the dilemmas presented since they feel so human-sized. Even as the film becomes more formulaic in the second half, it maintains the limited perspective of its main character as the rudder. I feel that's the key difference between this and other more populated Pixar confections. The vocal work is terrific, especially since Ed Asner ([[ASIN:B001RIYVYK The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]) perfectly captures Carl's gruff exterior without resorting to cheap sentiment to reveal his vulnerability. Nine-year-old Jordan Nagai provides the right energetic bounce for Russell, while Christopher Plummer ([[ASIN:B000AP04OM The Sound of Music]]) has a field day playing all the various shades of Muntz. Peterson himself does stellar vocal work as both Dug and the squeaky-voiced Alpha, the German shepherd leader of the dog pack. Younger children may be bored by the film's more deliberate pacing and even at the idea of cheering a septuagenarian, but the more patient ones will be well rewarded.<br /><br />The 2009 DVD is chock full of extras beginning with the obligatory short that that preceded screenings of the movie, \\"Partly Cloudy\\", a charming concoction in which clouds fancifully give birth to animals. Another five-minute short focuses on Dug's misadventures. Several pieces deal with individual components of the film, for instance, each character's development from inception to onscreen character, how Carl and Ellie's house evolved, and how all the balloons and Muntz's zeppelin came to being. There are alternate endings dealing with what to do with Muntz at the end, as well as one that expands on Carl and Ellie's backstory. Also included are an interesting making-of featurette, a documentary of the filmmakers' visit to the Tepuis Mountains in South America to research the film's overall design and storyline, a piece about composer Michael Giacchino's score, and the various trailers for the film.om inception to onscreen character, how Carl and Ellie's house evolved, and how all the balloons and Muntz's zeppelin came to being.

B002ECJZ76|4.0|This is Northern Europe's version of how the Christmas figure of Santa Claus came into being.  Who knew that Santa was an orphan?    The movie is dubbed in English so the lip movements don't match the words which can be slightly distracting but does not away too much from the movie.  There is a complete absence of any religious meaning to Christmas other than just a holiday celebrated every winter.  But it is a wonderful story of wanting to give back to others when they have been generous to you.  The orphan boy makes good.      This is not a razzle-dazzle Hollywood movie loaded with special effects.  In fact, there are practically none in the movie other than the very last scene.  It is a simple story with a simple message.      There are some beautiful shots of winter scenes which adds to the seasonal flavor of the movie.     Christmas has many dimensions and relates differently to a variety of people.  This is the secular version where it really is just about giving to say \\"Thank You!\\" to others rather than having any deeper spiritual meaning.  If that is what the holiday is all about to you, this is your kind of Christmas movie.      Enjoy!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Really enjoyed this film, probably one of the best Star Trek movies, up there with Wrath of Kahn, and First Contact. Thought the plot was really clever, to reboot the franchise.
B00243FQFA|3.0|Some episodes in this final season of Stargate Atlantis are boring. Some are rush. The overall quality of the show is still better than the new series, Stargate: Universe.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Fantastic game....even my 4 yo can do it if he is only playing with one other person.  I'm happy to play this with him over, and over....and over again rather than play candyland!!  :)  The tiny one square/two square tiles are small and easy to lose if you're not careful, but we always try to play on a table so we can easily spot runaway pieces.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I first viewed this movie about a year ago and I knew I would purchase it. The music was great. I have three children that love music and play instruments. They enjoyed the idea that music binds people together. I loved the characters. My only wish was for an ending where August and his parents actually speak, but in a way I guess that would take away from the whole theme of the movie.
0061537969|5.0|A touching and well written story.  has a little bit of aeverything for most readers.  I recommend it especially for dog lovers.
0061537969|5.0|A friend told me about this book with the following; \\"anyone who has loved and cared for an old dog NEEDS to read this book.\\"  She was absolutely correct!  I loved this book...and while there are personal reasons that lead to the crying, it was deeply cathartic and ultimately beneficial.  I took valuable reminders of life's lessons from this beautiful and compelling novel.
1401323820|4.0|This was a fantastic book!  It's just like watching an episode from the tv show itself!  Theres one scene in particular that was delightfully suspenseful....(the one after Nikki Heat gets out from her bath to an unexpected visitor, was my personal favorite) and i couldn't put the book down!  So if you like the show, read, the book!  The only downside was the size of the novel itself. i wish it had been longer...but it was still a great read.  So if you've got the extra cash, or just enjoy 'Castle', this is a must read.
0061914177|5.0|This book is a quick read and Gary shares his journey in a no BS way.    The internet is moving into a period where branding yourself will become important. We all have a passion that we can talk about no matter how stupid or big it may seem. Gary recommends you start blogging about it and work very hard to research and hussle to become the name or master in your field. By doing this you \\"Crush it\\".    The journey is not an easy one, it takes dedication, energy and being able to handle the times when it does not seem to be comming together. This is why you need to run with what you really love and this will carry you through.    Lots of great advise in this book. It is not about methods to make loads of money quickly but more about building your own brand over time and then when the time is right, monetise it.
0425200469|4.0|Interesting book.  I had seen the movie and tried to tie up the characters in the book with the faces in the movie.  Could not remember the outcome of the movie so the book held my interest until the finish.
0385504225|2.0|This novel is written like a tennage mystery novel with lots of \\"oh my gosh\\" and shocked surprise parts.  The author seems to like ending a paragraph with a seeming enormous discovery of some incredible find that turns out to be just another cryptic symbol that leads on towards some unknown unfathomable conclusion.  After the 6th or 7th \\"he looked with horror and shock at what was revealed\\", it gets tiresome, since there really was no reason for the horror or the shock.
B002SQ364Q|2.0|I feel kind of bad giving this movie only 2 stars.  After all, I had a vested - in very minor - personal interest in Taking Woodstock.  It was largely filmed right down the road from my house, and I even got to be an extra in it (although I'm not sure I ever actually appear in it anywhere).  An interesting experience.  More interesting, by far, than the movie has turned out to be once I finally saw it.  You'd think, with a movie that had that sort of personal connection, I wouldn't get drowsy in the first 15 minutes, but I did.  It just... dragged.  Forty minutes into it, the person who was watching the movie with me seemed bemused by its \\"Woodstock\\" title, and also expressed a feeling that it was somewhat aimless, adding that \\"it seems almost like an amateur movie\\".    It's a tough movie to critique, I'm discovering.  It's hard to pick any one thing that you can hold up as particularly bad.  Maybe that's the whole point.  It doesn't feel like there's enough real substance or structure, or point, or anything to really grasp onto with Taking Woodstock.  In all the hours I sat around on \\"the set\\", waiting, watching and listening to what was going on, and observing Ang Lee directing, I remember thinking to myself that it didn't seem like he really knew what he wanted a lot of the time, that there was a certain vagueness to the vision.  Assistants often stepped in to try and clarify for people what was wanted, which came across (again, to me, at least) as contradictory and confusing.  And I guess that's how Taking Woodstock struck me: vague and unclear as to what it wanted to be.  It doesn't help matters that the movie can't even culminate in ending up at Woodstock itself - the actual event.  I understand the reason for that.  It's about one person who was pivotal in making the event happen, and the irony that he never manages to see the concert.  A window to the world of one insignificant individual....  Is that the point of this film?  Couldn't just about any of us bethe subject of a movie then?  Well, I digress....    On the upside, Liev Shreiber as Vilma was a definite high point.  He was subtle and understated in a role that could so easily have been performed over-the-top by anyone else.  I only wish his character had been the subject  around which the rest of the movie revolved.    I recommend this only for people who are so obsessed with Woodstock they'd find even the minutia of seemingly unrelated events leading up to the concert to be of interest.  For most of the rest of us, this film may only leave you wondering why Woodstock was even a big deal.
068484267X|5.0|I believe this book splashed the name Frank McCourt onto the international writing scene. And I think he deserved it. I imagine there are millions of other stories much like his, and I can't imagine that it took this long for someone to tell it and gain such a massive audience. But McCourt is the one who told it and told it very well. Perhaps the best general word for the book is poignant. McCourt experienced such losses and challenges that he had to grow up long before his time. One senses that boyish struggle between wanting to just be a child and realizing that he had seen far too much of life to do that. I will not recount the crises and incidents that make up this life, but I will say that you will be moved profoundly by reading it. That is because there is heart and soul in this account.
B002RKSZN0|4.0|I have read this book many times.  It isn't as fun to read as some of Austin's other works, but I enjoy it anyway.  It is a bit like a Cinderella tale.
1423117166|5.0|I have bought many Disney books since the early 70's are there are a few that are truly great, such as Illusion of Life.  Last year the first book in the Archives Series came out with the theme of \\"Story\\" and it too was a great book.  The second book in the series, \\"Animation\\", is not just great but magical.      The book consists of animation drawings with no backgrounds and minimum text.  Think of a museum experience without wearing a listening device telling you what you are seeing.  Take a really close look at Jiminy Cricket by Ward Kimball. Just shadings and pencil marks.  Then start pulling away and the illusion of life happens right before your eyes.  Glen Keane's beast is a swirl of pencil markings that transform into the prince.  You can feel Scar's movements, Alice's wishing thoughts and Dr. Facilier's plotting thoughts.     If your not convinced, find a copy of this book in a store and leaf through the pages.  I hope that you have a similar or even more magical experience.  If you love animation, this purchase is a no-brainer.  Thank you John Lasseter and all the artists collected in this volume.
B00070DK1E|5.0|How this album beat out Metallica for a heavy metal category Grammy still baffles me. However, on it's own merits you have to applaud Ian Anderson for writing and playing most of the instruments on this album at his home studio/fish farm in England. The writing alone is brilliant on song such as Farm on the Freeway and Part of the Machine. The latter was never part of the original release. This is classic Tull at it's finest and I would recommend it to any Tull fan on the fence about adding this CD to their collection.
1401207529|5.0|Written by Frank Miller, draw by David Mazzucchelli- the great story of Batman starting out. The back of the book is loaded with original story  boards, scripts and sketches which are fascinating to look at. Probably the most striking and incredible part of the book is the hand-painted panels that were done just for this edition.
B000055ZDT|5.0|this album is essential... you dig sludge/riff rock.... and you don't own this album...hang your head in shame... save yourself before it's too late!!!!!
B002KAOSEW|3.0|I've always been drawn to the Rambo-type story line: Man against corrupt town. So I dove into this book with gusto. Unlike some other readers, it did manage to hold my interest fairly well. I didn't mind the repeated trips into Despair. However, it was disappointing to see Child's climb atop a soapbox. Okay, so he's against the war in Iraq. It's very sad we've lost some of our guys there, but it is beyond doubt that the international scene of today is far more complex than during the days when the U.S. could ignore most military uprisings or terrorist hotbeds, knowing they would not dare attack on our soil. But my biggest gripe with Child is his terrible, hackneyed stereotype of Christians. That's something even Hollywood has partially abandoned for inaccuracy. Sure, there are still some crazy, even dangerous, cults out there who claim they're teaching the Bible, but Child doesn't differentiate between those and the traditional Church that does far more good in society than most are aware of. Child is such a fine writer this so-so offering won't hurt him in the long run.
B002RKSZWG|4.0|I enjoy this book and read it about once a year.  This book is hard to describe, and I don't know why I like it: I just know I do.

B0012E6R3W|5.0|After \\"The Legacy\\" I figured Testament would put out a few more bad albums and just fade away. Or even worse sell out their fans like Metallica and change their whole format to please the commercial masses (and their bank accounts). Out of whim I downloaded The Formation of Damnation and for only $5 what can I possibly lose? BTW thanks Amazon!! This is by far the best metal album I purchased in many years. There is not one song on the album I do not like. It's just old school metal and that's how it should be. WOW! My ears are still ringing from playing it so loud!!!!!!!
B002KDUDG6|1.0|I just don't see what everybody is raving about. I own the two previous CDs and this one is nowhere near as good. I popped the CD into my car and started driving only to think 'What the heck and I listening to?' Then Micheal starts singing. I seriously thought I was listening to the intro to a James Bond movie. Oh that first track is horrible and things don't get much better.     'Haven't met you yet' and 'Hold On' are both nice tracks. (The only two Micheal had a hand in writing) 'Crazy Love' is OK. The rest are horrible.     Do yourself a favor and just buy the the individual songs and save yourself a bundle. I wasted $12 on this and I could have been happy with the two nice songs for only $2. It's sad to see such an album from someone as talented as Michael.
031606792X|2.0|I was extremely disappointed with this book and would not recommend it for adolescent or teenage girls.  Poorly written and an even worse story line.  I am not sure who wrote this book! It does not appear that Stephanie Meyer really put much thought into it.

B000ZECQ08|4.0|One quick thing I love about it, the cover...I saw the DVD from the right side and I see Malfoy and Snape. Odd I thought, but cool. So I picked it up and from the left side, it looks like Harry and Dumbledore. I know it's trivial but its the little things I try to smile about.     If you've read the book you probably spent a good majority of the movie going \\"where did that scene go?\\" and yes there is a lot missing. The Half-Blood prince was simply too dense of a book to fit into a 2 hour movie. A lot of the book is building up to what happens and unfolds in the final book, I would have rather seen this film in two parts then leave out scenes (or add scenes like they did). I think for this movie to be fully enjoyed and understood, you would definitely need to read the book.     Spoilers Ahead (actually if you read the book these aren't spoilers, just things you might have noticed are missing): These are just some of the more important scenes that are left out: The final Hogwarts battle, Dumbledore's funeral, Sirius' property being stolen, Harry and Ginny's relationship and its ending, where are the older Weasley boys?. There are other parts that are gone, other reviewers have already touched on them.     I did give this movie four stars because I feel it did deserve it. One star because its a Harry Potter film, I enjoy the series. Another star for the chemistry between everyone.  It was great, especially now since they are coming of age, hormones are running wild and love is blossoming, its a normal part of growing up. It also provided a great balance to the darkness that overtook the movie. Another star for the emotional conflict of Malfoy, it was excellent. He was able to get more screen time and we see his internal battle. And the last star for, the acting. I think everyone did a great job portraying the emotion or lack there of in the film. Except the ending, I felt more emotional reading the book than what came across on the screen.  After a slight let down of this movie, now the wait begins for Nov 2010 for part 1 of the Deathly Hallows (or maybe not since it's the same director).
0374530718|4.0|I wish I had read this book when I was about 15. It presents itself as a novel and a primer in philosophy. It certainly succeeds in the latter role. The book manages to covers three thousands years of thought in a very concise and simple format (without distorting positions) for young readers.<br /><br />If this book has faults, they are as a novel. 'Sophie's World' has a great twist toward the beginning of the work, which opens up a second-world that can't be explained without revealing too many spoiling details. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize how chaotic this second-world becomes toward the end of the book. The author takes too much pleasure in fantasy and disorder to render a coherent 'world' for Sophie. The overarching story is still touching and effective, and the second-world effect is, overall, a nice touch.
B000068CNX|5.0|It goes without saying that this show is incredible. I was very pleased with the condition I recieved it in.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|Great page turner style with weak storyline.  I have read all of Dan Brown's books and this is the worst, by far.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|If you enjoy Start Trek you will enjoy this movie.  The younger crew members are totally believable as earlier versions of the Enterprise crew.  The story is up to par.  I am hopeful that there will be a seaquil with the same cast.
B000W74EQC|5.0|My mom bought me the first Harry Potter book when it first came out, I loved it and continued to read everybook since then. But I never started watching the movies until \\"Goblet of Fire\\" came out, I'm big on reading but not so much on movies coming from books. That being sad, I enjoyed this movie a great deal and it stayed very true to the book in my opinion. At this point everyone knows the story of Harry Potter and his beginnings so I'll skip on that. Luckily the movie jumped right into the plot, they didn't spend too much time on the his life with the Dursley's and touched on the more important scenes. The casting was done well, each of the kids were able to grasp and portray the personalities we've all read in the books, as well as the Hogwarts professors.     Reading all of the books before even watching the first movie didn't take away from the excitement of watching Sorcerer's Stone. I think this movie is a great intro into a fun and exciting series of books.
0618918248|5.0|Throughout his career, and alongside many other prestigious scientists, Richard Dawkins has offered the layperson plenty of scientific proof of evolution as a fact, by using an accessible language that everyone can understand to explain otherwise complex biological systems, the relations between them, and their changes over time. In \\"The God Delusion\\", Richard Dawkins tones down the hardcore science a bit, and exercises scientific reasoning to explain/dismiss religious belief in a supernatural all-powerful all-knowing being. His writing may seem arrogant at times but for me, it feels more like the type of impatiente a parent may have that his child still believes in Santa at the age of 15. It is a delicate subject, and this definitely has an effect on the appearance of arrogance. If you are a religious person, this book may seem like an unwarranted attack on your faith - my advice to you then is that you read it skeptically, enjoy Dawkins' writing and learn what you can from it, as you should with any book you read, religious or otherwise.
B0026P3G12|5.0|After reading all the fantastic reviews about this album, what else is there left to say?  What a pleasant surprise from a precious angel from a little place on the other side of the world.  I got the CD about a week ago and have been listening to it over and over again (everywhere).<br /><br />Susan Boyle, congratulations on your first album of many, many more to come (hopefully!!).  You are truly gifted.  Thank you for sharing your \\"Dream\\" with us all! :)
B001QOGYA4|4.0|I was very skeptical when I saw the trailers for this movie proclaiming that it was a 'new Disney classic'.  I grew up with the original classics and so I took it upon myself to judge this movie based on those expectations.  Here are those expectations I had when walking into the theater:    The old-school Disney musicals played a lot with the idea of a dark and gritty storyline.  Look at the Lion King for a perfect example.  The story contains death, manipulation and murder.  Many of the movies are like that, ranging from the 101 Dalmatians (not technically a musical, but just as gritty...who would want to hurt puppies?) to Beauty and the Beast, considered by many one of the best.  As part of those sad and depressing scenes seared into our brains, there was a lack of outright humor.      Now take a look at the spin offs and sequels of Disney that have popped up in recent years.  The Lion King 2, although slightly dark, contained a lot of slap-stick humor with characters leaping high in the air and constantly slamming into each other.  Yes the classic musicals had some of this, but the humor was more implied throughout story and situation rather than thrown in our faces like today's modern movies.    So where does this leave the 'Princess and the Frog'?  Quite honestly somewhere in the middle.  The beginning of the movie starts off quite well, with wonderful character development, a beautiful setting, and immediately likable characters such as Tiana, Navine and even the Shadowman in his own way.  Tiana's song is quite brilliant, showing a darker side of life while still keeping the spirit of hope.  The Shadowman's song, although not quite as devilish as 'Be Prepared' and 'Poor Unfortunate Souls', contains enough eye candy that we can overlook its faults.    The middle is unfortunately where the movie falls a little flat.  As I outlined  above the older Disney movies didn't rely so heavily on slap-stick comedy but still put in situational humor.  The escapades of Tiana and Navine are filled with comic reliefs and half-baked notions of 'dangerous escapes'.  The worst in my opinion has got to be the frog hunters who are so campy the audience never gets a clear sense of danger.      The ending thankfully pulls the movie up by its bootstraps and includes a darker twist with a very impressive final encounter with the villain.  I won't spoil anything, but I have to say that the Shadowman, although he may not be quite as powerful as previous Disney devils, definitely is one of the most interesting to look at during his final scene.      So why after slamming the movie quite a bit I say 4 stars? Had I based my review solely on my personal enjoyment I would give it 3, but only because I went into the theater clearly looking for a 'Disney classic'.  Whether 'The Princess and the Frog' achieved this goal remains to be said, only time will tell as that is the mark of a true classic.  For today the decision on whether or not to watch it can be based on this: the movie is enjoyable, contains some fantastic New Orleans-inspired music and nicely develops a sweet romantic story about dreams and what we as humans truly want/need in life.
0525421033|5.0|There are two kinds of books, those that you finish reading and leave you with fleeting memories of the attractive hero, the silly heroine, and the overall storyline, or perhaps all you noted was the glaring plot holes, inconsistencies, ridiculousness or flat characters. At any rate, it's a book that you read, either like or dislike, but no sooner than you have turned the last page, it is out of sight and out of mind. Then there is the other kind of book that will touch your heart, or awaken a lingering memory or a potential fear that will haunt your mind so that even long after you've fallen asleep, your unconscious self is still wading through the details. Your dreams will be fitful and when you finally awaken, you will find yourself tangled up in sheets with puffy, swollen eyes from tears that you shed when you weren't even aware enough to know you were crying. If I Stay is the former.     Mia is eighteen and has the kind of family any of us would pray to be born to and the kind of boyfriend that can only exist in the fictitious world. Furthermore, she is a gifted musician and is about to be accepted into the prestigious Julliard. Mia has a choice, she can follow her love of music, go to Julliard and accomplish her cellist dreams, or she can stay with her family and the love of her life and follow her heart. Either way, she has something to gain and something to lose. Then, one fateful morning, Mia's world is turned on its head and life as she knows it changes. The one thing that remains the same is the question that Mia has asked herself for the past few months, should I go or should I stay?     In art, the brightest colors appear beside the darkest of lines and in this book, the most endearing, tender and happy moments are surrounded by grief so palpable, that you will laugh through your tears and sob with a smile. If I Stay demonstrates the kind of beauty that can only exist alongside despair and shines all the more for it. It is filled with happiness and sorrow, laughter and tears, birth and death, love and loss. By writing a book filled with parallels, Forman proves that life has no opposite and thus leaves readers with an overwhelming since of joy and hope despite tears and grief that they are bound to feel.

B0017VG66I|5.0|This is a review for the double DVD set released by Paramount featuring THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE(1962) and SHANE (1953).<br /><br />THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE is in wide screen b&w, directed by John Ford and stars John Wayne, James Stewart, Vera Miles and Lee Marvin along with a magnificent cast of character actors, some of them regulars in many of John Fords's previous directoral efforts.<br /><br />Critic/director Peter Bogdanovich has described THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE as the last classic film of Hollywood's  Golden Era and although I am not sure  when the golden era ended I wouldn't be able to muster much of an argument with him or anyone else who voiced appreciation for this incredible, dramatic, humorous and ultimately emotion filled movie.  Often this has been called a great western but I think it is so much more<br />than a genre picture.<br /><br />THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE is about how what we call civilization came to this country, different areas in different eras, and just as  importantly, how history is recorded and passed on down the generations.<br /><br />Ford shows us what the actual truth is and then explains to us that \\"When legend becomes fact, print the legend.\\"  Just as he did in FORT APACHE Ford is telling us, among other things, that sometimes the unvarnished truth has to step aside for myths that will pass as facts in order to help encourage the advancement of civilization.<br /><br />Aside from all of the above, THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE is a cracking good story about a freshly minted lawyer who comes to the western town of Shinbone in a territory<br />that is yearning for statehood.  But the wealthy cattle ranchers are against US law coming to \\"both sides of the picket wire\\" and employ a gunman named Liberty Valance,<br />played by Lee Marvin, to intimidate the new \\"sodbusters\\" and small businessmen<br />who are trying to build lives for themselves and their families.<br /><br />One thing leads to another and the young lawyer, Rance Stoddard played by Jimmy Stewart, with help from Tom Doniphin, played by John Wayne, eventually realizes that if he wants<br />law & order in Shinbone and the surrounding area, he's going to have to use a gun to<br />get it.<br /><br />That quick summary in no way relates how entertaining and exciting this classic film is.  And ultimately how heart wrenching it becomes. A movie that you'll never forget, when they refer to film  classics, this is one of the prototypes.<br /><br />SHANE (1953) was directed by George Stevens and stars Alan Ladd, Van Heflin, Jean Arthur (in her last screen appearance), Brandon De Wilde, Jack Palance and Ben Johnson, again, with a fine cast of character actors.  Shane is in really authentic looking  Technicolor<br />and and was a full screen release.<br /><br />SHANE is played by Alan Ladd who drifts into a once open range which is now being homesteaded by \\"sodbusters,\\" small farmers who are trying to make a go of it despite the harrassemt and occasional violence visited upon them by the big rancher in the area, the Ryker brothers,  who want to keep the range open for thier cattle to graze.<br /><br />Eventually,the Rykers hire a notorious gunman, played by Jack Palance, to help clear out the stubborn farmers once and for all.  The idea is first to threaten and then, if neccesary, to start killing the small farmers.  But the farmers rally behind Joe Starret.<br />played by Van Heflin, and his hired man, Shane, to fight for the right to farm the open range.<br /><br />I think the thing I appreciate most about SHANE is the way both sides' positions are explained in a fairly even-handed way, although the Rykers are willing to do most anything to get what they want. SHANE was a trend setting film in its time and is still quite a good film to watch every now and then.  It has humor, excitement and and a little romance and is just a well done film, the kind everyone says can't be made anymore<br /><br />Overall Igive this double feature package of THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE and SHANE<br />an enthusiastic five star rating, two fine films in one box for a relatively reasonable price.  Both films have the original trailers included as extras and SHANE has a very informative commentary track as well.  Both films have English subtitles and  Shane<br />has a French soundtrack included. I give this double feature set as high a recommendation<br />as  possible.give this double feature package of THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE and SHANE<br />an enthusiastic five star rating, two fine films in one box for a relatively reasonable price.

0786868724|5.0|It's not easy for me to read a lot at one time, for various reasons, but I stayed up until 2 a.m. because I could not put this book down. Like all good writers, Mitch Albom writes books that are \\"fast reads.\\"    Having read two of his publications (loving one and not loving the other), I picked this up with a skeptical eye.  Well, by halfway through, I didn't need more to convince me this was the Detroit sportswriter's best book ever (and no, it's not about sports, but you know that.)    \\"Hey, all I know is that once I was blind, and now I can see,\\" paraphrases an incident in the Bible and pretty describes Mitch and Henry Covington's roads to spirituality, along with the hope that all of us can change for the better.     In the meantime, we get a loving and profound portrait of another \\"Morrie,\\" this one being Albom's childhood rabbi, Albert Lewis.  What a great man!  The same can be said for Covington, who's dramatic story will leave you shaking your head in amazement.    Whether you're Jewish, Christian, Muslim, agnostic or atheist, \\"Have A Little Faith\\" - like a good sermon - many times will make you think Albom is talking right to you.  Great stuff!
B000AMPZF8|5.0|Excellent CD!  Easily in top 5-10 favotrite CD's ever made.    What makes this so unique is the technical ability of three musicians and the level of mastery they all possess.  This is a CD that hits on all cylinders from the first song, New Born, up until the end, with Megalomania.  What amazes me the most is just how effective Muse were in fuzing aggressive songwriting with the more laid-back style that most Muse fans know.  In my opinion, this is Muse's best work as there are so many jaw-dropping moments; the chorus of Citizen Erased, the opening piano lines of Space Dementia, the haunting space-opera of Micro Cuts, the manic pace of New Born...I could go on and on.    If you are a music lover, you need this CD.

B002T9H2LA|4.0|Not that I mind talking per se--and Q.T. did a great job with the talking scenes in Pulp Fiction--but here, the scenes of people chatting, socializing, etc. go on much too long and don't add much to the story.  This could have benefited from some trimming here and there; it ends up being 2.5 hours long as it is.    Otherwise, Brad Pitt turns in another excellent performance as Aldo, the leader of a small group of Nazi hunters who scalp the Nazis after killing them, though they also release a few of them after carving swastikas on their foreheads as a warning.  Eli Roth is great as his righthand man, and the fellow playing Landa, their primary foe, is outstanding.  The photography in France is very nice, as are the locations; the songs chosen well; and the scenes of violence are actually rather brief and not as graphic as in some of QT's previous work.
B000A7Q2DM|2.0|Though 30 Seconds to Mars's debut is one of my favorite albums, I never really warmed up to A Beautiful Lie.  Perhaps it's because their debut was so strong that there was no way A Beautiful Lie would top or even match it.  The release of This is War motivated me to give A Beautiful Lie another try.  Fortunately, the music is better than I remember.  But I remembered another reason why I never listened to it much: the CD is content protected.  This means that I cannot listen to it on my iPod.  If you have the audacity to want to actually copy the tracks onto your hard drive (I feel dirty just thinking about it!), the software on the CD will determine how it will be done and what player you will be able to use to listen to the tracks.  If you like to use iTunes to listen to the music on your computer, then like me, you're out of luck.  Because of this, and because I have found this so extremely annoying, I simply haven't listened to the CD much at all.  Perhaps the band and their label have learned their lesson, because I can listen to This is War on my iPod.  All of you half-wits in the music industry, here's a tip: if you want people to ignore your CD's, and if you want to make music fans angry, use content protection!      Update: I recently purchased a copy of A Beautiful Lie without content protection and added it to iTunes without incident.

B0029XFN9O|3.0|After YEARS of waiting for this to be released in anamorphc widescreen, it finally arrives on Blu-Ray. Quick review: The picture quality was disappointing to say the least. Not necessarily the Bluray transfer, but there is an INSANE amount of film grain in several of the scenes. Very annoying if you care at all about picture quality. My step-children who are 12, 11, and 8 asked me if something was wrong with the disc, that's how bad it was. Buy at your own risk. It was good just to watch the movie again after not seeing it for several years.
B002XHN776|5.0|Get over the \\"sound\\" of the album; it is not techno.   I'm tired of the \\"it sounds like U2 or Kings of Leon\\" reviews.  This is the equivalent of saying all 70's or 80's music sounds alike.  No, it's the \\"new sound\\" the sound of the decade.    The fan chants. This is the most brilliant idea ever.  Just imagine the response at concerts. All the fans knowing exactly what to sing and when. \\"The Summits\\" where a true testament to how passionate this band is about their fans. I don't find this annoying at all. Most chants take place as an intro, exit or some chorus we would butcher trying sing along to anyhow.    Favorite tracks of mine, Night of the hunter, Closer to the Edge    The \\"From Yesterday\\" video \\"The Wish\\", asks for \\"the sound of tomorrow\\" this is it, This is War!

0307266303|5.0|Born to Run is one of the best books I've ever read.  I tore it apart, and it's taken my running hobby, which I did to maintain my physical appearance, into an almost spiritual, communal activity.  I've bought six copies of the book to give to friends to Christmas.    The way that McDougall weaves this tapestry of victory and defeat is spellbinding, and the fact that the whole thing reads like one long, fascinating magazine article makes it a real page turner.  McDougall's writing style is fantastic, blending poetic insight with irreverent humor.  The combination is something nothing short of inspirational.    I recommend this book to anyone who has ever felt passionate about anything in their life.  Even if it's not running, the spirit of these people is totally infections and spreads positive effects into other aspects of life.

6304806434|3.0|My goodness, is CON AIR lame.  A hulked-up Nicolas Cage (sporting quite the shaggy mane) trying to spit out a southern accent.  An assembly of cons so nasty and mean they put Dante's Inferno to shame.  Steve Buscemi as a mass murderer?  Come on.  Maybe a serial peeping Tom; at least that's more believable.  And a huge Federal transport plane, in flight, suddenly and violently taken over by the inmates.<br /><br />Really, really lame.<br /><br />Ridiculous as the entire movie is (with its goofball, over-the-top ending), I still had fun watching CON AIR--primarily because it's mindless violence.  I found myself looking forward to the next death-defying escapade, wondering how director Simon West was going to top the previous madcap shenanigans.  And if you're going to have a cold, brutal, calculating villain (with one of my alltime favorite character names:  Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom), whom better than a smug John Malkovich?  The action is, as mentioned before, fast and furious, with Cage playing a former Army Ranger finally going home to meet his young daughter, only to be caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time and having to duke it out with the bad guys in oh so many interesting ways.  John Cusack plays an \\"Aw, shucks\\" U.S. Marshal on the ground forever chasing the plane, while Colm Meaney constantly annoys as an arrogant DEA agent.  Everything about CON AIR is so silly you won't be able to believe you just watched it, yet its high octane silliness will make you glad you did.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
0143113100|1.0|Doidge's book breaks no new ground and presents his ideas as revolutionary. In fact, they've been around for years, and he doesn't fully understand them. It's a stealth portrayal of psychoanalysis as neuroscience.

He would show the pattern beyond the target note but state only play from and to the target note. The lead patterns became very confusing to me at this point. I ended up purchasing Troy Stetina's book on scales and was able to figure it out from there. All in all it was just a few details that threw me. I would still purchase it again. The book is still excellent.
B001GM28HO|5.0|Wow, I thought I was getting old because there's fewer and fewer pop music that I could actually appreciate, and then comes LADY GAGA reviving the whole pop music landscape!  This album is probably the most exciting pop album I've had the pleasure to really enjoy in a VERY, very long time.  I bought this album after hearing \\"Poker Face\\" in my car sometime in the spring of 2009 and my first reaction was \\"wow, 80s new wave is making a comeback\\", and in a fresh and more danceable way.  I found myself bouncing in my car and before I knew it, I was heading to my local Best Buy to look for the album.  I didn't expect much from this album since the last 10 or so pop albums I've purchased had very little exciting material to offer, but was I wrong about this one!  Before I knew it, I started having \\"flashbacks\\" of Blondie, Madonna, Gwen Stefani, Christina Aguilera, and bits and pieces of 80s new wave and dance music.  Needless to say, I felt like I was reliving my teen years after listening to Lady Gaga's first album.  It's not exactly 80s music, but it's more like 80s music updated to a more today sound.  All in all, I would pick this one as the best pop album of 2009.  I didn't really like this album the first month I listened to it, but as I played more and more of the other songs, I found myself liking the rest of the album more and more.  By the time the new \\"Fame Monster\\" was released (8 new songs), I found myself running to the store to see what other exciting material Lady Gaga could come up with and that's when I was totally hooked!  I am now a fan and I'm going Gaga over Lady Gaga!  Get this album AND \\"The Fame Monster\\"!  If you like awesome pop music, you will definitely not be disappointed.  Just don't blame me once you get hooked on this and find yourself youtoobing EVERY Lady Gaga song!

B002JTMNX2|5.0|This is a great comeback from this legendary band even if there is just one original member left, but we all know Mick was/is the brain of Foreigner right? And even if I love Lou Gramm and followed him even out of Foreigner (solo career/Shadow King) I welcome the addition of the great Kelly Hansen on vocals. He does a great job filling the big shoes Lou left. I follow Kelly Hansen since his days in Hurricane, and through other bands/projects he was involved (Perfect World, Unruly Child, etc.) and I have to say that we are in front of one of the finest voices in melodic hard rock. Also the addition of Jeff Pilson, ex-bassist of the legendary Heavy Metal band Dokken (one of my favorite bands ever) is a smart move since this guy, apart from being a solid bass player, is a great singer himself, and I'm taking lead singer-good. Ask Don Dokken ;)  So with a deluxe lineup like this there was no chance in hell that this would end in disaster, and of course it didn't. I expect more quality stuff like this from these guys in the years to come, and I'm sure they will deliver. Long live to Foreigner!

I have met a few SEAL's, and this was a gripping account of the training and suffering they undergo to wear the trident.  I am in awe of their capabilities and training, and the depiction of BUDs training and the mission and aftermath are riveting.  Unfortunately, the book bogs down a bit in the middle, as the author starts to opinion-ate...I am sorry about what happened to him and his team, but to complain endlessly about the rules of engagement is pointless.  Petty Offer Second Class', or CPO's, or even LCDRs on the ground do not get to make determinations regarding rules of engagement that could affect US Foreign Policy, or the war in general.  Sorry, you are the blunt club of American diplomacy, and go where no one else will go and do incredible things, but you don't get to shoot just anyone.  Deal with it - for decades now, Air Force pilots, submarine commanders, tank drivers, etc., have complained about the Rules of Engagement and how it puts US lives in danger.  You are a volunteer, if you can't deal with the rules, get out of the Navy, join Blackwater, make huge money and shoot whoever you want with no repercussions.....

B002BSHXJA|5.0|Having read previous reviews with much interest I was very eager to compare these mono apples with my old bowl of stereo apples.  Thankfully I was able to prove to myself that my hearing is still sufficiently good to distinguish some real differences between the versions, and I love the mono series.  It is the way I remember them as a teenager.    As has been described so beautifully by others there's a warmth, a depth, a roundness to the recordings that isn't quite shared by the stereo offerings.  But then again there is so much more to hear in the stereo mixes (and I won't enter into dialogue about the merits or demerits of George Martin's early 2 channel mixes other than saying they work for me.)      I love to be able to focus on the drumming here, or the cowbell there and the stereo mixes allow me to do this.  And it's given me the urge to seriously revisit those albums which I'd not listened to often in recent times.    As a Beatles compleatist I just had to have this collection, and I am in no way disappointed.  Because it's the Beatles man, and that is always enough!  I know very few people will be interested in the packaging, but it's so complete it's OTT.    The fact that the Amazon price was less than 50% of the list asking price here in Oz was the absolute bonus.  But don't expect to see my collection on eBay soon  -  this one's a keeper.    So do yerselves a favour and chase this one up.  It's the Beatles man, and that alone is reason enough!
B001FB55I0|1.0|I was a big fan of the franchise but this really is not part of it. Unlike all the other films, it lacks a story, or even characters you care about. Hard to imagine since it is based on franchise with characters you DO care about. But the truly talentless MTV director McG (and whoever wrote this confusing dark mess of a script) shows his only skill is stringing together a bunch of explosions and fight scenes.   One of the first problems is the John Conner character and the terminator prototype character look so much alike, it's hard to tell who is who through much of the movie, especially since it is mostly shot in dark, grimy locales. Second big problem -- a complete lack of humor or heart. Totally cardboard characters that its hard to care anything about. Third problem -- the ending sequence is ludicrous. So many holes there it's hard to know where to begin.   So here's the deal. You like lots of explosions and fights -- go for it. Lots of that here. You want a movie that makes sense or has any sort of connection to the original Terminator movies, forget it.

0385504225|2.0|I have read all of Dan Brown's previous books and had high expectations for this one.  He is one of those authors who, given a few facts and a bit of history, manages to weave quite a tale.  He did an excellent job of this with the DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons.  In fact, I'd hazard to say that \\"Angels\\" is the rival (story-wise) of DaVinci.  And may be a little better.    But \\"Symbol\\" is another matter.  Again he does a great job of setting up the story.  And through most of the book, it's a tough thing to put down.  But, at the end, I felt that the conclusion wasn't the \\"fulfillment\\" of the story that it should have been.  It's a bit like seeing a movie with the \\"alternate ending\\" that nobody liked.  My reaction upon finishing \\"Symbol\\" was an almost literal \\"So what?\\".  It was a very under-whelming conclusion to a great build-up of a story.    Actually the word \\"symbol\\" in the title is a bit of a mis-application of that word.  And I was disappointed to see that there was no historical substantiation for the supposed knife of Abraham that so prominently was featured in the book.

At the outset of the book, McDougall and I share a frustated love for running - we both recognize that there's no easier way to stay in good shape, but our bodies are screaming at us. Unlike me, McDougall took action - not surprising, given that he's a former war correspondent and extreme sports journalist (McDougall's clearly in the \\"rules are made to be broken\\" camp).  He spoke with some of the country's leading sports-injury experts, and they said that humans just aren't met for distance running.  The best solution to avoid jogging injuries is to get a bike.    But McDougall's curiousity led him to the Copper Canyons of Mexico, some of the most rugged terrain on earth.  The Copper Canyons have been home to Apaches, drug lords, rattlesnakes, and the bones of intrepid explorers who got lost in the lethal landscape.  The Copper Canyons are also home to the Tarahumara, quite possibly the greatest distance runners alive.  McDougall is mystified - how can this tribe, who have never seen a running sneaker, literally run a deer to ground and become better runners as they age?    McDougall's exploration leads him into what may be the craziest subset of humans alive:  ultra-racers.  These folks sneer at marathons, often running 100-mile races in a furious single stretch.  From the mountains of Colorado to the burning flats of Death Valley, these racers find themselves in the agony of a long race.  To McDougall's fascination, these runners do not break down, and the ones who run barefoot seem to be healthier than those with the latest weapons from Nike and Adidas.    What you find in \\"Born to Run\\" is an exploration of the human foot and how it is perfectly designed for distance running.  You also find an exploration of the human heart as a band of misfit ultra-racers are brought together with Tarahumara tribesmen by the Caballo, a legendary American burn-out who has been living the Tarahumara lifestyle for years.  Sharing a deeper love for running than most of us can comprehend, the racers unite for perhaps the greatest demonstration of running talent ever seen.    \\"Born to Run\\" reads a bit like propaganda - you can't help but look askance at some of McDougall's claims.  But the results in the book don't lie - humans are born to run, and the modern running shoe doesn't seem to be helping.      All in all, this is a thrilling read.  If you're looking for a page-turner to get you through your next LA to New York flight, leave Dan Brown on the shelf and grab this book.  You'll be glad you did, and I can't wait to put McDougall's theories into practice - the opportunity to reclaim the road for my feet is just too tempting.

B001KVZ6FW|1.0|This has to be the all time worst animated PG movie I've ever seen. It has to be the first animated movie where they show blood. Blood in a children's movie! I realize that the MPAA is nothing more than a rubber stamp for the main stream motion picture corporations. If this movie had been made by an independent it would have received a PG-13. I mean, come on, a comedy. The last half of the movie was nonstop violence. There was, one very funny part to the movie and that was the plot error and what a big error it was. The movie begins with the adventurer Charles Munts, who was maybe 40, who went to South America to find a bird. Then fast forward through Carl Fredrickson's life from a child watching the adventures of Charles Munts to old age, maybe 75 years old. Then Carl Fredrickson travels to south America and meets Charles Munts who looks younger than Carl Fredrickson. What??? Let's do the math. If Carl Fredrickson was 10 at the beginning and Charles Munts was 40 and at the end Carl was 75 then Charles would be 105.   I would not show this movie to my kids and unless you like feeding your kids a diet of violence you shouldn't show it t yours.
B000002IP1|5.0|Genesis singer/drummer/songwriter Phil Collins released his fourth solo album ...But Seriously in November of 1989.<br />In the four years between solo efforts, Phil played both Live Aid locales of London (solo and with Sting) and Philadelphia (a Genesis stronghold and played solo and played drums for Eric Clapton and the world shocking Led Zeppelin reunion). Phil also did another Genesis album and tour with Invisible Touch in 1986/87. Produced an album for Eric Clapton and even did some shows with him. Plus guested on albums by Beatle Paul McCartney, Tina Turner and Tears For Fears. Plus did some acting. First with an appearance on Miami Vice as Phil the Shill (a con game show host who looks for dishonest ways to make cash (he doesn't die thank goodness) and starred in the British film Buster as the notorious train robber Buster. That soundtrack did spawn two more Phil singles out of \\"A Groovy Kind of Love\\" (his version was the best IMHO) and \\"Two Hearts\\". Then in 1989, Phil went back in the studio with guitarist Daryl Stuermer, bass player Leland Sklar (with help from Nathan East* and Pino Palladino+) plus guests David Crosby, Steve Winwood, Sting guitarist Dominic Miller and Clapton himself. What emerged was an about face from the fun upbeat of No Jacket Required with a slightly more serious choice of song subjects. (My review pertains to sequence on original vinyl LP which differs from CD and cassette and IMHO the better sequence of the album).<br />Phil gets things up and roaring with the great brassy blast of \\"Hang In Long Enough\\"* which may make it \\"Sussudio 2\\" but not as it has live drums (played by Phil who did all drums and keyboards on the album as always) and screaming guitars from Dominic Miller and horns by The Phoenix Horns and funky playing from Stuermer. \\"That's Just The Way It Is\\" follows and addresses problems in Northern Ireland and featured David Crosby (the same one from Crosby Stills Nash and Young) supplying backing vocals. \\"Find a Way to My Heart\\" is another great piece. We then get to the adventurous epic \\"Colours\\" which is arguably one of the best pieces Phil has ever done. The epic features some African rhythms and the lyrics were about the apartheid issues in South Africa. We then have the instrumental \\"Saturday Night and Sunday Morning\\" (not on LP due to time constraints) which is the first instrumental on a PC album since \\"The West Side\\" from 1982's Hello I Must Be Going. The first side of the vinyl ends with \\"Father to Son\\" (no, not a remake of the Queen song from Queen II but) an original. Great tune by the way.<br />Side two of the album starts with Phil's second song written about the homeless crisis (after \\"Man On the Corner\\" on Genesis' 1981 album Abacab) called \\"Another Day In Paradise\\". It again features David Crosby on backing vocals and Dominic Miller on guitar. This song was another #1 hit in the US for Phil and got some airplay on US rock radio. Next is the jazzy and bluesy \\"Heat On the Street\\" (which didn't appear on the LP version). Then it's \\"All Of My Life\\" featuring some fiery organ work from Steve Winwood (the same Winwood from Spencer Davis and Traffic). Then we have the nice ballad \\"Do You Remember\\"+ (another US hit) which is a great song. We follow with the fun of \\"Something Happened On The Way To Heaven\\"*. This Top 20 hit was a superb number and ends with a fiery Stuermer solo. The vinyl LP closed with the Gospel sounding classic \\"I Wish It Would Rain Down\\"+. This track was always one of my favorites and had Eric Clapton's bluesy guitar work all over this classic. Plus the gospel choir made this track sound more powerful. The track was another US Top 10 and a huge US FM Album Rock Radio smash. This track works well as a closer.<br />...But Seriously would become Phil's second (and to date last) album to hit #1 on the Billboard charts and its sales were equal to No Jacket Required. Also, this album in my view aged better than its predecessor.<br />RECOMMENDED!is another great piece.

B0026P3G12|5.0|My family doesn't pay attention to the internet or celebrities, but they love good  music of all kinds.    When my husband bought this CD for me for my b-day, he thought it was just for me to enjoy. We both found tears in our eyes during some selections.    For the first time ever, I am buying the same album/cd for half of my Christmas shopping for list. After hearing a selection of this CD, my very hip neice, my sister the school teacher,  my mother and my 98 year old grandmother all wanted a copy.  That is how good this cd is. Update...it's after Christmas now and everyone loves it.    Besides the tunes that are familiar, \\"Proud\\" and \\"I am who I was born to be\\" are splendid and stand on their own.  There isn't one track on this cd that you want to skip over.    How many cd's do you know that have a version of a rolling stones song, broadway, hymns, and classic easy listening tunes all by the same artist?    To top it off, as young hip singers like Adam Lambert are nose diving down the charts as fast as it hit the charts,  here is this plucky middle aged charmer right at the top and staying there now for 2-3 weeks I think.    Even if it's after Christmas...get this CD!
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I am very happy to announce that Amazon now has in stock the correct version of 'Let The Right One In' on DVD with the improved/original theatrical subtitles.

B001O8C5KK|4.0|Earlier this year, when this recording was first released, Mr. Ralph Moore and I engaged in a friendly debate regarding the preferred recording of Butterfly. We seem to hold different opinions. Since I had not auditioned this recording, I reserved judgment on his assessment. Mr. Moore stated that he looked forward to my review, and here it is, albeit delayed.    I concur for the most part with Mr. Moore's assessment as well as his four star rating. I find Ms. Gheorghiu's portrayal of the title character to rank with the finest of Butterflys on record. Simply, she moved me. At times she broke my heart. That from a person who obtained his first recording of this opera almost 50 years ago. It is evident to me the care, preparation and study she put into this recording. Whether Maestro Pappano assisted Ms. Gheorghiu, I do not know. It is oft times a small scale, intimate portrayal, reminicent of Anna Moffo's 1959 recording.    I further concur with Mr. Moore's assessment that the tenor Jonas Kaufmann is not right for the role of Pinkerton. Listening to his bellowing baritonal and at times histronic outbursts, one word came to mind-Heldentenor. Great for Wagner, but not Puccini. It is like recording Tristan with either Bjorling or Bergonzi as Tristan or Siegfried in the Ring Cycle. No.     As Mr. Moore indicates the supporting cast is adequate, although I do want to mention an outstanding Suzuki of the past, Rosalind Elias, on both RCA recordings. I want to also mention a sympathic sonorous Sharpless in Mario Sereni on the EMI De Los Angeles-Bjorling Butterfly.    Finally Antonio Pappagano does a fine job conducting. He seems to have the pulse of what is unfolding on stage. In sum, despite Kaufmann's miscasting, I would recommend this recording for Ms. Gheorghiu's memorable performance of the forlorn Butterfly. \\"Tutto e finito\\".
B002PMV9FG|1.0|I bought one of these DVD's and it looks as though filmed it in a theater on a CELL-PHONE. Has Amazon taken to selling counterfeit DVD's? Dialogue is impossible to make out and the pictures are bathed in mud.     If this DVD is NOT counterfeit, the studio should be ASHAMED of itself for foisting such trash on the public!    I don't know whether I like the movie itself --- after watching this DVD, I have no idea what the movie was about.
0345409671|1.0|Some people love this novel while others hate it. I used to hate it. Then I read Blood Canticle and realized there are far worse things out there...    It's not so much that Memnoch The Devil has a bad premise. It's actually very intriguing. The Devil tells his side of things to a vampire. This can be very interesting. I just feel it would have been better if Anne Rice wrote this as a stand alone novel without using her pre-established characters.    The character of Lestat existed in a world that could easily be our own. There was no certainty as to who or what created the universe, just like our world. People of any religious background could see Lestat existing in their own real world. Now for a lot of people it seems Lestat exists in a solely Catholic mythos, completely segregating the non-Catholic fans who had liked to imagine Lestat in their reality.    Lestat goes on a journey of Heaven and Hell and comes back quite worse for ware. An eye got ripped out but he manages to get it back later. For a while it's unclear whether Lestat really went on this journey or if he had some sort of break down or was tricked by powerful spirits in an elaborate illusion. Anne Rice, today, hints that it was all real. It was better ambiguous, Anne.    As I said. The plot itself isn't too bad and for the most part Lestat still behaves like himself (unlike that being in Blood Canticle). But there were certain things I definitely did not like.    1. I don't like how this book isolates itself from non-Catholic fans as I already explained.    2. The start of her sloppy lack of editing.      3. In Memnoch The Devil it was Lestat's left eye that got ripped out and was then given back. (Trust me, this is not something I'd forget or get confused- Believe me.) In Blackwood Farm and Blood Canticle Anne says it's his right eye. The only explanation for this would be that Quinn has no sense of left or right and Lestat's extremely forgetful.    4. In Memnoch The Devil Louis requires a magnifying glass to view the details of illustrations drawn by mortals. I know Louis is weakest of the vampires but he still is supposed to have eyes stronger than a mortal. What happened to all his talk of vampire eyes?    5. In Memnoch The Devil Lestat made a vow never to kill anyone, human or vampire, ever again. But by Blood Canticle he's developed Armand's personality traits in that he kills rogues and rule breakers who need guidance even when they beg for their lives. Anne Rice has forgotten this vow.    6. If older vampires turned to dust in Memnoch The Devil how did Louis survive going into the sun in Merrick without an infusion of more powerful blood to begin with?    7. In Tale of the Body thief and Memnoch The Devil Lestat claims that he had slept with many villagers by the time he was fifteen. Yet I could swear he was sixteen when he lost his virginity to the female actress in the troupe he had almost run away with in The Vampire Lestat novel. He never spoke of making love again in his autobiography but it was ambiguously implied what he and Nicolas must have done together. I'm sure Lestat WISHES he had been that promiscuous as a mortal but it seems to me he had been very anti-social until he had gotten to Paris, was able to truly be himself and let himself go. You saw what it took for him to make his ONLY friend, Nicolas.  Also, in Memnoch The Devil Lestat said that many villagers came to the castle claiming he had impregnated their daughters. But in Tale of the Body Thief Lestat became very concerned that he might have accidentally impregnated that one woman waitress he slept with while temporarily turned mortal. So I doubt he would have simply ignored it if he had gotten someone pregnant in his mortal life.  On the same note, in Memnoch The Devil, while in Hell Lestat had a vision of himself accidentally killing someone in a bar fight while drunk as a mortal. Considering Lestat's mortal obsession with mortality and goodness, somehow I doubt this would have happened without him telling us before. Also, it seems like Anne Rice is confusing him with Louis. Lestat never got into bar room brawls as a mortal. When he got drunk he got maudlin and sentimental, not violent, that's a different type of drinker all together.    The vampires are becoming too saintly. Lestat's been through Heaven and Hell and all of creation, or at least the character thinks he has, we're supposed to assume he has and trust it. And Vittorio sees angels. Vittorio reminds me of the little boy in The Sixth sense. 'I see dead people. This isn't exactly a mistake but with all the spiritual content the angst from the vampire's uncertainty about the fabric of reality and the nature of good and evil his horribly compromised. A certain human-ness is gone. Anyway, didn't Anne hint once that she wanted to do a story where the government or a laboratory might learn about The vampires and capture them and try to figure them out or worse. That could have been a good novel, maybe even more believable than Memnoch The Devil. The novels are just getting too spiritual and history orientated and not so much story orientated. And People are now just buying them, no matter what happens in them, just because it has Anne Rice's name attached to them and out of loyalty they feel they should love them, especially if Anne Rice says that Memnoch The Devil is her greatest work and that she is no longer happy with what she had done with The Queen of the damned- even though that novel had explained what happened in The Vampire Lestat, it told what became of the boy reporter, it united all the vampires, it explained where The vampires came from and it introduced The Talamasca- all and all I'd say that's pretty damned good!    I did like that in Anne Rice's version of Hell all you needed to ascend to Heaven was to learn to forgive.    One scene in Memnoch The Devil that I felt was completely unnecessary was the scene of Lestat drinking the blood from the character, Dora's, Sanitary napkin. What was the point of this? Was Anne Rice going through her monthly cycle when writing this and wanted imagine a way to end it a lot faster?    Another bit that felt... well, just wrong to me is when Lestat is talking to Roger, the ghost of his crime boss victim, Lestat asks Roger why he didn't let the old captain have his way with him when he was a boy. What the...?!? Anne?! Since when does Lestat want little boys to have sex with dirty old men who try to molest them?! This felt very out of character to me. It came out of no where and nothing in the earlier books would imply Lestat having an inclination in favour of this. In fact he has once said that nothing justifies the suffering of a child. And you don't think that sort of abuse would cause suffering?!    Finally the most horrific thing about Memnoch The Devil that I think Anne Rice, herself, doesn't realize. Her depiction of The Devil and God imply that The Devil is not all evil and God is... not that nice. In fact he's kind of petty and cruel. But this is the adventure that makes Lestat become a pious Catholic by Blood Canticle? He was raging against it at the end of Memnoch The Devil. What the Hell happened?  Lestat used to have a steadfast belief in good and evil. If he couldn't believe in anything else he believed in good and evil. It seemed that this was an important and truth faith, the faith in the capacity for goodness. This is a beautiful thing to have faith in. But as of Memnoch The Devil he lost it. He gained a religious faith but to me, it seems, he lost the more important faith. The faith that Good can still control the hearts of man.  What good is it to believe in religious deities if you cannot believe in goodness? This has caused Lestat to become cold in the later books and unrelatable. He obsesses with his new-found religion but real faith. The faith in anything good or decent seems lost. This is more important than any other faith you can have in beings governing the universe. Infact I feel belief in God REQUIRES faith in goodness first. So this new found religious piousness in the character feels shallow... empty... And Anne Rice, herself, doesn't seem to realize it.    Anyway, That's my opinion of Memnoch The Devil. Take it or leave it.    I prefer the original first three Vampire Chronicles. Interview with the vampire, The Vampire Lestat, The queen of the damned, and for comic relief Tale of the body thief but I'd stop there. This is the start of the decline at least for Lestat.

B002KREVCO|4.0|Finally AC/DC release some lesser known tracks!  Disc 1 - Studio rare tracks are excellent and a good addition to your collection.  Disc 2 - Live rare tracks is awesome and shows what the band do best, and capture           some of Brian's best live vocals ever (Largo '81 show - Unstopable!)  Disc 3 - Brings Family Jewels up to date with all the videos post 1991, which           was a bug bear of mine about the original Family Jewels.  It does           include some bonus videos and makings of, which are funny.    First point, I Put The Finger On You (live Largo '81) is not on Family Jewels disc 3.  I have the audio of it and a copy of the video on an old vhs.  It is absolutely smoking, when are we gonna get that whole Largo show from 81?    What they have released on FAmily Jewels, Plug Me In & now Backtracks is balltearing!    However all hardcore fans have all this stuff, but I guess now we get good versions.  My problem is, where are all the other unreleased songs?  Let It Loose, Alright Tonite, The Cock Crows?    AC/DC have way more unreleased stuff.  5 extra songs recorded for Flick Of The Switch,  Blow Up Your Video (although we already have three - Snake Eye, Down On The Borderline & Borrowed Time)   and there was also another five recorded for Stiff Upper Lip (which we already have Cyberspace).    I am sure there are more than that as well.      It is a bit half baked considering most of this has been available in Australia (Where I am from), as b-sides and original album tracks on their early albums (why cut them up for America anyway?). But I absolutely love back tracks, but it could of been ALOT better in a hardcore fans eyes!!!  Seriously worth it's money though.

0385342020|5.0|From Inner Flap, Lara Lington has always had an overactive imagination, but suddenly that imagination seems to be in overdrive. Normal professional twenty-something young women don't get visited by ghosts. Or do they?When the spirit of Lara's great-aunt Sadie----a feisty, demanding girl w/ firm ideas about fashion, love, and the right way to dance---mysteriously appears, she has one last request: Lara must find a missing necklace that had been in Sadie's possession for more than seventy-five years, and Sadie cannot rest without it. Lara, on the other hand, has a number of ongoing distractions.Her best friend and business partner has run off to Goa, her start-up company is floundering, and she's just been dumped by the \\"perfect\\" man...Sadie, however, could care less.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book! In typical Sophie Kinsella form, it was a funny and light hearted read. I really enjoyed the character of Sadie, she was so fun and sassy that she really added something special to the book. It does have a little mystery going on within in the book for all you mystery buffs and I found myself eagerly turning the pages and trying to guess what was going to happen next. I was myself laughing out loud quite often (Especially at the part where Sadie dresses Lara in what she considers \\"proper dress attire\\" for her big date) Also, I found the references to the 1920's very fascinating and enjoyed reading about that time. All in all, if you have read any other of Kinsella's books, you will love this one as well. If this is your first book you are reading by her, you will not be disappointed.

B00005JM0B|2.0|The Terminator series has a huge fan base and I was looking forward to this installment. Unfortunately James Cameron is out..ditto Linda Hamilton. When a director and one of the stars decline to sign on, you know you're headed for trouble! The story is ambitious, but trying too hard to top the jokes of T2 they lose sight of the serious core that have made the first two film so good. The TX...well she's hot and the FX are good, the character seems to fall flat like almost everything in this film. It's an OK film at best, but with a running time of an hour and 40 minutes this film seemed longer than the second film which runs 2 1/2 hours!<br /><br />If your a fan of the series you will probably want to see this, but Terminator Salvation should have been the third film not this overblown and surprisingly boring entry. The two disc DVD has a nice DVD transfer, but I didn't find the extra material to be all that great. Of course the usual commentaries and trailers are present, but who cares? Arnold should have rejected this half hearted clunker and had more than just a CGI cameo part in T4 Salvation!

B0025KVLU6|5.0|Today it is new to many people. However for me it is a slice of time from my history. As with all great art after one does the best that can be done with the standards, the next step is to go out to left field that threatens to lose followers and may or may not work. Just when you thought The Beatles time had come to take that step, they came out with \\"The White Album\\" and proved that no one knows where the classics end and experimental must begin.<br /><br />I was fortunate enough to obtain one of the scarce copies in 1969. And it seemed funny to be playing \\"Back In The U.S.S.R.\\" at West Point New York. As for the rest of the album many reviews look on this as an eclectic collection. On the surface it maybe. Then you can hear and feel the underlying pattern of the Beatles. They are just extending their range and keeping that which makes them unique.<br /><br />I believe this album is addictive.<br /><br />Most people look favorable on this album others look at it as a transitional time for the Beatles. Ether way they realize the Beatles as any artist have down the universal fundamentals that make good music and have adapted it to a unique style.<br /><br />The few detractors are usually people that do not understand what goes into music and would benefit from an appreciation class.<br /><br />True some tracks probably would not be purchased as a single. It is the peril of many albums that they must carry some of the weaker contributions.<br /><br />Bottom line is that this item is worth the investment.
0156034026|3.0|The narration of this book takes place over the course of a dinner shared by Changez,and an unidentified male American.  Changez, a Princeton graduate, had secured a coveted job at a prestigious firm, Underwood Samson, determining the value of other businesses and was in love with Erica, who was in love with her deceased boyfriend.<br />The conversation was essentially a monologue of how Changez realized the rage he felt against America's imperialistic foreign policies.  Following his joyful appreciation of 9/11, his life began to unravel, leading to his being fired from his job, and ultimately returning to his family in Lahore, Pakistan where he becomes a professor involved in anti-American rallies.<br />Changez' hold on reality is tenuous.  In his desperation to connect with Erica, he offers to have her pretend he is her deceased lover.  That is the second and last time they will make love.  It is very clear that no matter what he felt about America, he would have stayed here had been able to win Erica's love.  He couldn't and he turned his rage elsewhere.  It made a very intelligent character, too transparent.<br />Through the conversation, Changez told the most intimate details to a man whose name he never used, and whose connection to him is never discussed.  It didn't make sense.<br />The ending also left me cold.
0061137456|5.0|Allen Ginsberg's Howl has long been one of my favorite poems. I like and admire the poem for various reasons; most of these reasons are related either to the particulars of the poem or to its technical aspects. As a poem, I find it to be a watershed work, both for the extent of its influence and its immense historical importance; therefore, I hope to be able to use it as a standard for my own writing and as a source of perpetual inspiration.      Reading and re-reading Howl is, for me, an enjoyable experience. For a first-time reader, the depth and sophistication of its imagery can seem staggering and even intimidating, but subsequent reads reveal something new each time. Unlike many poems, great or otherwise, Howl rewards re-reading. Much of the poem's complexity and appeal derive from its series of vivid, phantasmagoric portraits, or \\"chains of flashing images\\" as described in the Bob Dylan phrase that Ginsberg himself likes to quote. These images are described well and fully; they succeed in conjuring up particularly keen visions in the reader's mind. As Carl Solomon, Ginsberg's primary inspiration for the poem says, Ginsberg possesses a \\"great skill in describing the maze of thoughts of upset people and conveying them to the reader.\\" By any account, the poem's vivid imagery is one of the keys to its phenomenal success and its immense power. In my own writing, I tend sometimes to veer too closely toward abstract composition without any grounding in concrete imagery; constantly referring back to Howl will, hopefully, steer me away from this tendency.     To me, one of the most noteworthy aspects of Howl is its mesmerizing use of the particular. Readers who are largely ignorant of Ginsberg's life, as I was when I first read the poem, will likely read all of the incidents catalogued in the first part of the poem as fictional creations of the author. However, as Ginsberg reveals in the \\"Author's Annotations\\" section of this edition, nearly all of the events depictedin Part I of the poem are based on real occurrences. Even the events that seem the most unlikely have their roots in reality; for example, one of Ginsberg's friends actually \\"walked all night with their shoes full of blood\\" (4), while another really \\"jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge... and walked away unknown and forgotten\\" (5). That these and many of the other events described in Part I actually happened is a definite surprise to me. Such surprise, no doubt, arises because of the manner in which Ginsberg relates the events in his poem - i.e., surrealistically - and also because it seems to have been written in a very spontaneous fashion, as will be mentioned later. Knowing the history behind the lines in the poem reveals to one how beautifully and successfully Ginsberg shows the beauty of the particular; he manages to take events that he knows of, some of them quite personal, and turn them into something universal. On the surface, such disparate and seemingly unrelated vignettes would appear to have little or no relevance to anyone other than Ginsberg and the others involved in them, but the poet admirably shows that this is far from being true. As hinted at in the Carl Solomon quote above, this is the true genius of Ginsberg's art. The thought of even attempting such a thing probably does not occur to many, and it certainly does not occur to me. In most of my writing, I typically do not even consider using particular events from my own life because they do not seem universally applicable; however, after reading Howl, I find this to be a false assumption. For me, then, Ginsberg's enlightening use of the particular can serve as a fountainhead of inspiration.     The famous long lines of Howl comprise, for me, another of the poem's attractive elements. I have always been partial to long lines in the poetry that I choose to read; I also tend to employ them in my own compositions. Ginsberg's lengthy lines, in particular, are flexible and graceful, as they serve severalfunctions. First of all, they contribute greatly to Howl's sense of pacing; this becomes especially clear when one hears the poem read aloud. Secondly, they allow the poem to flow very smoothly; indeed, when read, the poem almost seems to take on a distinctive rhythm of its own. Few poets, of course, favor the long line; between Whitman and Ginsberg, precious few used it to their advantage. Ginsberg, on the other hand, not only uses the long line, but also is famous for doing so; his skillful deployment of the long line in Howl clearly demonstrates the technique's poetical vitality. Ginsberg has said that the whole of Howl was an experiment to see what can be done with the long line (163); in that case, it is most assuredly a successful experiment. Howl provides constant encouragement - and justification - for my own use of the long line when I sometimes have doubts about its usefulness.      I also admire Ginsberg's deft hand with tropes. In Howl, his use of the trope of anaphora stands out especially. All four parts of the poem have a word or phrase that starts out most of the lines - \\"who\\" in Part I, \\"Moloch!\\" in Part II, \\"I'm with you in Rockland\\" in Part III, and \\"Holy!\\" in the Footnote. The constant reiteration of these words and phrases is important to the pacing of the poem; they lend it a breakneck speed and a sense of cadence that is nearly hypnotic. As many fans of Howl well know, the poem truly comes alive only when one hears it read; these anaphoric phrases are one of the main reasons for this. Ginsberg also manages to come up with, through word association, several memorable phrases that seem contradictory or oxymoronic; the most famous of these, of course, is his \\"hydrogen jukebox\\" (3). I try to be aware of the tropes available to me when I write and to make good use of them; Howl remains a goldmine of inspiration.     When applying the poetics of Ginsberg, as displayed in Howl, to my own writing, probably the most important factor is Ginsberg's constant revision. The version of Howl that I read contains facsimiles of many early drafts of the poem, complete with Ginsberg's changes. The amount of changes that Ginsberg made in his poem from the first draft to the final one is staggering. I was very surprised by them, as I am sure other also are. The reason for this being that Howl appears to have been written in a very spontaneous manner, much like Kerouac's work. What looks like an astounding display of spontaneity in Howl is actually carefully controlled art. To be sure, the early versions of Howl are, in their basic essence, quite similar to the finished product; the power and beauty of the poem are already present in them. However, through his various changes and alterations, Ginsberg ended up with a poem superior to the one with which he started. The finished version is cleaner, more succinct, flows better, and reads better than the earlier versions. In short, Ginsberg, much to this writer's surprise, shows himself to be a meticulous but successful reviser. I hope to apply this fact to my own writing, because revision is one of my weak points. After scouring the various versions of Howl, though, I at least know that successful revision is possible; hopefully, I will be able to learn more about this delicate art from studying Ginsberg.     Many people view Howl as essentially a poem of protest, but Ginsberg himself has said that it is not meant to be viewed in this light alone. Armed with all the candor of truth, he declares of his poem that, \\"To call it a work of nihilistic rebellion would be to mistake it completely. Its force comes from positive `religious' belief and experience.\\" What the poet says is true; Howl is not a hopeless, nihilistic lament. Instead, it is a hopeful (and very spiritual, in the non-traditional sense) howl from the wasteland of contemporary culture and society; it is the voice of one man who insists upon holding up a lucid torch of compassion and reason in a world full of oppressivedarkness. One of Ginsberg's intentions with Howl was to, if possible, save the best minds of the next generation from being \\"destroyed by madness\\" (3). Still, the poem does contain protest elements, and these I particularly admire. Part I of the poem chronicles the unfortunate experiences of many of Ginsberg's hapless contemporaries; it shows the apathetic extremes that are possible when the world is a mere hollow shell that serves only to bring on malaise. It also reflects the fact that there has been more than one \\"Lost Generation.\\" The inherent, even if implicit, protest in Part I against the mindlessness of the mainstream world is very powerful and piercing. Similarly, the second part of the poem attacks the source of many of the evils in society, the military-industrial complex. Ginsberg compares the problem identified by Eisenhower to Moloch, the fire god of the Canaanites; the former sends young, idealistic kids off to their deaths in pointless wars, whereas worship of the latter involved sacrificing children by fire. The protest elements of Howl, then, are incredibly powerful and striking, even if they are not essential to the poem's core sentiment. I frequently make use of protest methods in my own work, and successful examples such as Howl are a never-ending inspiration to me.     Lastly, I look upon Howl with admiration because of its sheer daring. The poem was, of course, highly controversial upon release; it even provoked a legal trial after having been dubbed obscene by legal authorities (Ginsberg 169). I can scarcely imagine the reactions of some of the more conservative readers of the 1950's to the poem; after all, this was the decade of utopian suburbia and Leave It To Beaver. Some lines seem daring even now, as the fact that I cannot even quote them under Amazon rules attests. I admire Ginsberg's resolve - whether it was bravery, mere bravado, or whatever else - to publish and distribute his poem in the midst of such raving censorship and extreme prejudice. These things, of course, are still occurring, but the fact that Howl was published in the 1950's make the event even more noteworthy. With the publication of Howl, Ginsberg boldly announced himself to the world as an atheistic, homosexual Jewish Communist. Ginsberg's determination to stand behind the work he had written, no matter what the consequences, was an awe-inspiring decision that can only elicit feelings of admiration and inspiration from me.

0786838655|3.0|Percy Jackson has always been a little bit different. From having ADHD and dyslexia to seeing strange things. So when his math teacher grows wings and comes after him he thought it was all probably his imagination. He was wrong....<br /><br />What a fun kick off to a series. I really didn't know what to expect from the book other than it was worthy of a movie. I was pleasantly surprised! The story moves along quickly and there's never a dull moment. The Greek mythology was very fun for me. Mythology is something I have always been interested in so that was a added bonus to for me.<br /><br />From the very first page I loved Percy's dry sarcastic humor. He definitely didn't feel like a 12 year old but maybe that's just me. All the characters brought something different to the story. They were all very well written and just generally fun.<br /><br />Overall The Lightning Thief was a action packed trill ride of a middle grade book. Rick Riordan has created a world not to be missed.
B001GM28HO|5.0|When an album released over a year ago is still selling like hotcakes, you just know that there's got to be some really good music on it. There isn't a dud in the bunch on this album; it's all great music. Sure, this music may not be for everybody, but it's heaven for anyone who likes today's pop, dance, glam, electro and even pop/rock; and Lady Gaga's enormous energy impresses me a lot! The quality of the sound is excellent and that artwork is terrific.<br /><br />\\"Just Dance\\" has Lady Gaga singing really well to a strong beat and that music fits in perfectly with her powerful vocals. Lady Gaga gets some excellent assistance from Colby O'Donis for \\"Just Dance,\\" too! This is a terrific song about a woman dancing with a guy in a nightclub as she has some drinks and wants to go home with him. Terrific! \\"Love Game\\" is pretty good although some of the lyrics aren't exactly for little kids; and I really like that awesome \\"Poker Face.\\" \\"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\\" slows down the tempo a bit for a somewhat more poignant number that still makes for great listening--and \\"Beautiful, Dirty, Rich\\" isn't shabby, either! Lady Gaga's excellent phrasing and her incredible voice enhances this number; \\"Beautiful, Dirty, Rich\\" is one of the major highlights of this album.<br /><br />\\"The Fame,\\" the title track about how people chase fame and fortune, has a cool beat; I won't forget this one anytime soon! Lady Gaga does this one up right with enthusiastic singing mixed with some music that can't be beat. \\"Money Honey\\" plays with major and minor keys to make this a standout; and I also like \\"Boys Boys Boys.\\" \\"Boys Boys Boys\\" has Lady Gaga singing about guys and it all holds its own very well.<br /><br />\\"Brown Eyes\\" is also quite well done--it's memorable and poignant. Lady Gaga makes this shine bright with a passionate performance; and \\"I Like It Rough\\" is yet another tune with an amazing beat. The CD ends with Lady Gaga performing \\"Summerboy;\\" \\"Summerboy\\" really leaves me wanting more--the way the song mixes major and minor keys makes it strong and Lady Gaga does this better than almost anybody else ever could!<br /><br />Overall, fans of Lady Gaga should get this (as if they didn't know that); and it also makes an excellent starter CD for people just getting into Lady Gaga and her really cool artistry. This is modern day pop at its very best; and I'll be hanging onto this CD for quite some while to come!g mixes major and minor keys makes it strong and Lady Gaga does this better than almost anybody else ever could!

0307454541|4.0|I certainly don't understand the opinions at either end of the of the scale. Some people offer harsh criticism of the violent and sexually offensive (even sickening) material--their opinion, not mine. Other than some of the four-letter words and explicitly sexual references, I see shows on TV that are more violent and filled with deviants. I characterize reactions to the book of this type as being puritanical.<br /><br />On the other hand, I certainly didn't find anything to rave about in this first novel of his. Yes, Stieg Larsson has a knack for story-telling, and the book was more than good enough to hold my interest. The author's characterization of Lisbeth Salander is especially effective, and I look forward to reading the next two novels and seeing how her character develops.

Now that I know how to express that...and am doing the things that SPEAK to her, our relationship has gone to a level never before achieved in 21 years of marriage!  Not only has it helped her to understand how much I love her, but it has helped me as well.

I used to watch GI Joe cartoon movie on VHS with my kids years ago and I gotta say that movie was FAR SUPERIOR.  Basically another example of easy special effects destroying art of film making and Hollywood chasing easy money with fat, dumb, and happy audiences who will see these types of movies no matter how bad the story is.  I feel ripped off spending $1 renting this.
B002NWRMVS|2.0|To start, I love Nora Jones.  But, I'm trying to listen to this on a fine stereo system and I can't get through it. Every sound on this recording is the same volume... blasting. It's hard to distinguish her voice from the noisy and obviously separately recorded, non-acoustic background \\"music\\". What a waste of her beautiful voice.  Maybe I'll try this in the car or on the TV's Bose system to make it more listenable.  Will the recording industry continue to commit suicide with these poor quality recordings while complaining of a lack of sales?  Maybe they could put two cuts on a disk, a compressed Ipod/internet download cut and a full range version for people who like realistic music with it full dynamic range.  Now that I'd pay extra for.  I'm off to try again.

1594488878|4.0|Having been disappointed with the last two Nick Hornby novels that I've read (\\"How to Be Good\\" and \\"A Long Way Down\\") I was a little wary when I started \\"Juliet, Naked\\" would this be a continued slump or would it be a return to form of his first two novels (\\"High Fidelity\\" and \\"About a Boy\\")?<br /><br />While still not as good as either \\"High Fidelity\\" or \\"About a Boy\\", \\"Juliet, Naked\\" is a step back in the right direction.<br /><br />Annie and Duncan have been together 15 years. Duncan is a huge fan of a fictitious Dylan meets Springsteen meets Leonard Cohen type musician, Tucker Crowe. He writes articles about him, goes on pilgrimages of places of notoriety from Tucker's life and career. He not only listens to but dissects every Tucker Crowe recording he has.<br /><br />While on tour in Minneapolis in the eighties, Tucker Crowe went to the loo and then left the bar where he was watching a local band that had been recommended to him. He promptly canceled his tour and retreated from the public eye. In his absence from the public eye, his legend grew within his small but rabid circle of devoted fans which included, Duncan.<br /><br />With the money running low, Tucker agreed to the release of the demoes and rehearsal recordings from his final and most critically acclaimed album, Juliet. This new version aptly titled Juliet, Naked (perhaps a tip of the hat to The Beatles Let It Be... Naked). Upon receiving a pre-release copy of the album Duncan is giddy with delight and posts a glowing review on one of the many Tucker Crowe message boards that he frequents.<br /><br />Upon hearing the album, Annie, who has been following Duncan's fervor for Crowe, decides to post a review of her own. One considerably less glowing... How could this album with stripped down early versions of Crowe's greatest album be superior to the much more polished finished product?<br /><br />Her honesty prompts a thankful email from the reclusive Crowe himself... and that's where the story really takes off.<br /><br />The one consistency in all of Hornby's novels, even his comparatively sub-par ones, is a sense of natural empathy. He includes just the right details to make the characters seem that much more real to the readers. Being such a devout lover of music himself, he understands what makes those of us who have over the top fascinations with our favorite bands tick.<br /><br />The book is at times an examination of what it means to be a music fan. And without coming out and asking it, one of the questions the book poses-- when being a fan of music, are you a fan of the music that has been created or a fan of the person or people who created that music? Is it possible to be a fan of one and not the other?  The book is also an examination of the songwriting process. The very things that made Tucker Crowe such a great songwriter also proved to be his undoing as a father and a husband.<br /><br />At the same time this is a very human story about two people at a crossroads in their respective lives taking stock of where their lives have been and whether or not they can change the kinetic momentum of the past pushing them to perpetuate the mistakes of their past.

B002PMV9FG|3.0|I realize that movies will never be translated completely accurately and I have come to expect some liberties taken with the story.  I enjoy the movie but it easily takes the cake as the worst translation yet.  The excuses given by Mr. Yates as to why things we changed and added are gibberish.  THe idea that we weren't aware that there was a deep friendship between the trio is laughable.  The HBP is devoted to the discovery that Tom has used items to split his soul and that the mission is to destroy them.  The book has detailed many trips into past memories to learn about Tom's progression to evil and insights into how he got there.  I was shocked and disappointed to watch this be turned into a story that focuses on the obvious and leaves out so many details that made this book fantastic and creates the hurry and anxiety of the 7th book/movie.  This could have been a fantastic movie but I believe that so many of the good reviewers are just in love with the story enough that it hurts them to rate the movie poorly, I know that my instinct tells me that I should give it 2 stars but I can't bring myself to do it.  Mr. Yates and Heyman (SP) have taken a very wrong step in the story and I really hope that they can redeem themselves in the final book.

B0025KVLRY|5.0|I bought this CD expressly for one song - Money (That's What I Want).  But listening to the entire album again I considered that on this album probably more than any of their others, the Beatles were a true rock n' roll band.  Money has that raunchy edge in both the instruments and vocals that let you know they could get it on.  Roll Over Beethoven is another example of good rock n' roll.  I never really appreciated the Beatles when I was growing up, but in recent years I have come to realize just what genius' they really were.  They could rock you and then mellow you down with songs like All My Loving.  My opinion on them personally was that John and Paul were genius' in writing, but that the ego's in the band were just too much for them to handle.  If they could have worked together better there's not telling how many more albums like this one we could have enjoyed.

It wasn't necessary to the story and the story could have moved forward without it.  I hope that Lee Childs isn't going to move into slasher-pandering.  I'll stop buying his books if he does.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|I was a bit apprehensive with the new album when I heard and saw the video for the first single \\"Doesn't Mean Anything\\". It just seemed like it went on and on, and it got boring afterwhile. Then my interest was peaked a bit when the second single \\"Try Sleeping With A Broken Heart\\" was released; I didn't care for the video all too much but it was different than her other singles. So when the day came that it finally came out, I figure why not get it (or someone get it for me).   Alicia Keys has never let me down with previous albums, despite the inconsistencies on each album. I put the album in and I haven't stop playing it since.  For starters, she actually put an intro, and it makes sense and its pretty deep given its short.   Then it continues into \\"Love Is blind\\" which I really really love because it's not her usual sound and register, I almost thought it was somebody else. The lyrics are 'take 'em or leave 'em' but the music and the production is so addictive, you're jamming anyway.   By the time \\"Doesn't Mean Anything\\" came around, it made sense where it was and it was less obnoxious after hearing \\"Love Is Blind\\".   Although, I cringe when artists put all there singles in chronological order on the album, it didn't bother me much when the song was followed by the 2nd single \\"Try Sleeping With A Broken Heart\\".   There are slight weak moments: \\"Wait Til You See Smile\\" is one of those light, fluffy records on the album that teeter between fluff and filler. But I will give Alicia credit for putting those light, airy songs between heavy hitting moments on the album.   My two all-time favorites on the album, three if you include \\"Try Sleeping With A Broken Heart\\", are That's How Strong My Love Is\\" & \\"Un-thinkable (I'm Ready)\\".  The lyrics of \\"That's How Strong My Love Is\\" are reminscient of the flow of \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" & \\"This Woman's Worth\\". Her phrasing in the song gives me chills and the haunting chords in the background just knock me out. The chorus is one ofher strongest choruses and is a testament of how deep she is as an artist.   I really love \\"Un-thinkable (I'm Ready)\\" because it has a nice groove but it also makes you think of those intimate occasions with a special someone. That also gives me chills.  \\"Love Is My Disease\\" reminds me of the song featuring John Mayer from her last album, her voice is a bit hoarse which works for the urgency of the song. This girl shows vulnerability like no other female artist, outside of Beyonce.  \\"Like the Sea\\" is another light song but its more about her piano skills than it is about the material. so that's about a 3/5  \\"Put It In A Love Song\\", O.M.G. I was a little curious how it was going to work with Beyonce & Alicia. Both are strong women but their styles are different but very much high grade. I could've did without the simple beat but they both brought their A-game to this song.   \\"This Bed\\" another light song but the beat is a bit addictive  I guess Alicia had to add some more depth and eclectism to her album, \\"Distance & Time\\" and \\"How It Feels To Fly\\" are what that's for.   \\"Empire State Of Mind (Part II)\\" is almost a better version than the original. She kept the chorus, which made sense, but she added her own words. I love it...    all and all, this is one of her more impressive and fun records and it sounded like she was more free on this record...
B001EN71CW|5.0|A coworker recommended this series to me, and I am so happy he did.  I am not a huge fan of many TV shows in general, but this is one that I really enjoyed.

Great stuff!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I decided to finally take the plunge and get the mono box after several days of deliberation. First off, the albums sound great in my headphones, which is how I listen 90% of the time. Two of the albums come with the stereo mixes included on the disc. Second, the packaging is extremely cool. Each album being in a replica of the original packaging, everything in plastic sleeves, etc. really tells me this is a well thought-out set.    Two big factors for me were: (1) the aforementioned headphone listening. This is big for me. Listening to the old 1987 discs sometimes drove me a little crazy. That's just personal preference. (2) The \\"limited edition\\" tag for the set. Who knows how long this will be around? I find mixed information on the web. WIll just have to supplement with the stereo remasters I want. Or perhaps the stereo box in the future....    If you're still teetering, read the other Amazon reviews, especially \\"Cheapskate's (relatively)....\\" review. It is excellent and was a big help in my decision.    So, long story short, if you're on the fence, the set is far and away worth the cost.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This will show off your 1080p HD TV and make all your friends oh and ahh and get jealous. It's also a brilliant series and a joy to watch... and at the time it was like on sale at half price... so it was time to grab it!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle has a unique, beautiful voice that is not just a one-shot deal.  The variety of songs in this CD prove she has the ability to handle about any type of music.  Every note clear and bright, melodic and smooth.  I hope that she will continue to record.  My only change would have been to omit \\"Silent Night\\" in favor of a contemporary song.  \\"Silent Night\\" would be great on a strictly Christmas CD.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I've been using a Logitech G13 \\"gaming keypad\\" programmed with Lightroom's shortcut keys to increase image editing speed with Adobe Lightroom 2 and Beta 3.    Recently I edited a wedding reception and used the Logitech G13/Lightroom and oh-my-gosh you will not believe how much faster I was able to edit the job. Probably cut my editing time in half at the very least. It's a totally different experience than using a full sized keyboard with shortcuts as the hand stays in one spot, so no need to hunt for shortcut keys as on a full sized keyboard.    Did a ton of research on gaming keyboards and Logitech G13 really was the best in terms of build, drivers and manufacturer support. Purchased mine for $54.00US after rebate here on amazon.com a few months ago.    Other research included Belkin's Nostromo SpeedPad n52... Actually my gaming keypad journey for Adobe Lightroom was inspired by Neil Cowley's Lightspeed Workflow that uses the Nostromo n52. But upon research the Nostromo has zero tech support and drivers that have not been updated in a long while. Conversely the Logitech G13 is built by one of the top keyboard/mouse manufacturers and their forums are very lively with support from Logitech people and hard core Logitech fans. Drivers were recently updated also.    Lightroom has a limitation as many core development controls, ( Exposure, Color Temp, Fill Light ) do not have shortcut keys. To get around that use a program called Quickeys by Startly (both for Mac and Windows). First and foremost... it takes a lot of work to set it up via Quickeys, but it does work well once completed and well worth the effort. Quickeys maps out mouse clicks via screen/window placement so there's a lot of elbow grease involved and it has limitations... but it's doable for sure as seen on the open source keys website: [...] .  Actually go the open source keys website and download the Quickeys file and edit it for your own use as this will save yourself a lot of time.    I'm still experimenting using both Lightroom shortcut keys directly with the G13 driver combined with Qiuckeys to add extra functions.     But the bottom line is: Use Lightroom's stock shortcut keys with the G13 and you will still have an incredible speed improvement.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|This is a very well made and funny movie. I and my family sure did<br />enjoy every bit of this movie, you and your kids will too.

B001EN71DG|5.0|I really just wanted to say I was very impressed with how fast both DVD's arrived.  My hubby is a huge Star Wars fan and has wanted this set for some time now.  The price couldn't be beat and the service was impecable!!
0439023483|5.0|I'm not a big reader and i don't read that often. But soon as i started this book i couldn't put it down. The way Suzanne Collins set it up was fantasitc and very entertaining. Every second on every page i thought Katniss was going to either die or be kissed.   If amazon had a bigger review system i would go as high as it can go. Soon as i read this my mom read it then my brother then my dad it was crazy.   The whole book is so suspenseful and very easy to read.   My personal opinion is that this book is the best science fiction ever.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|These shipped so fast! excellent condition, no scratches on the box or dings or dents.. i was a little concerned about the box they shipped in though.. it wasn't sealed at either end.

0385474547|3.0|Imagine watching a slow slow slideshow of ancient or feudal african slide, while a very narrative voice of perhaps an old african man tells you the story as each slide slowly passes through. This is how it feels to read TFA. It gives a very interesting view of an African life. I would not say it can generalize African culture or living at all, but it does give you  a secular view, revolving around the life of one man.     This story, is more about one man in Africa while it simply shows Africa without focusing on it at all, except what is going on in Africa, and affecting the man.    I reccomend it, especially for those who do not tend to read books in the African genre. It's an easy read and interesting. (And you'll have fun pronouncing the names as well). Enjoy!
1591842972|5.0|Steve Jobs is the one man band that revolutionized computers in the 1970s and 80s (with Apple II and Mac), animated movies in the 1990s (with Pixar), and digital music in the 2000s (with the iPod and ITunes). More than 100 million iPods were sold by November 2007, and it's on track for 300 million by the end of 2009. Sony's Walkman, the current biggest hit, sold 350 million in its 15-year reign. Ninety percent of all music players sold are an iPod, and the iTunes online store has sold 3 billion songs. The impact of these innovations is that Apple's market capitalization increased $150 billion since Steve's return, and he has been named \\"The Best Performing CEO\\" by Harvard Business Review (Jan-Feb, 2010) and 'CEO of the Decade' by Fortune Magazine (11/05/2009). \\"Inside Steve's Brain\\" is part biography and part leadership guide. It picks up with Jobs return to Apple in 1997.<br /><br />Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985; he had taken it public in 1980, but it had degenerated into nonstop squabbling - including Jobs vs. his self-selected CEO Scully (formerly at Pepsi). After leaving Apple, Jobs founded NeXT, with the purpose of selling advanced computers to schools and putting Apple out of business; he also bought a struggling computer graphics company from George Lucas, propped it up for a decade with $60 million of his own money, and renamed it 'Pixar.' By 1995 it had brought out the first fully computer-animated movie,'Toy Story,' in 1995 and wowed movie-goers. (Disney bought Pixar from Jobs in 2006 for $7.4 billion, making Jobs its largest stockholder.)<br /><br />NeXT hardware failed to catch on - sold 50,000 units in 8 years, so Jobs concentrated on software for niche customers like the CIA. This software became the foundation for Mac OS X when he was invited back in 1996 as a consultant when Apple, led by Gil Amelio, bought the company as part of the deal for $427 million. Apple paid largely with stock so that 'Jobs would have skin in the game.' (Apple's market share had slid from 10% to 3%, Jobs wasn't certain it would survive, and quickly sold all but one of the shares.) The old Mac OS had turned into a bloated patchwork, with frequent crashes and lots of lost data. A rewrite name Copland was going nowhere. Jobs simplified the revised OS - eg. reducing the former 8 ways to access folders. The effort took 2.5 years by nearly 1,000 programmers, with Jobs heavily involved all the way - especially with the graphics.<br /><br />Jobs began with a product review aimed a cutting its confusing number of products with little distinguishing them, replaced most of the board and all but one of top management, resolved a bitter patent lawsuit with Microsoft (dropped patent violation charges vs. Windows in return for Microsoft continuing to develop Office for Mac, investing $150 million in Apple, and Apple making Internet Explorer Apple's default browser), killed production by clone-makers, cut the number of suppliers (IBM + Motorola to just Motorola) while getting better deals, and dramatically cut the number of hardware and software products - focusing on a matrix of portables, desktops vs. consumers, professionals. (The latter also allowed dramatic inventory reductions.) Amelio had cut nearly 300 projects, Jobs took the remaining 50 down to 10 - this included dropping the hand-held Newton and printers. (Jobs had the foresight to skip PDAs, seeing that cell phones would take over that market.)<br /><br />Nearly half of returned electronic products have been found to perform as intended - the problem was that consumers gave up trying to make them work after about 20 minutes. With Jobs, what was left in both hardware and software was as important as was left out - simplicity was his prime focus throughout.<br /><br />'Inside Steve's Brain' continues in this vein in much less detail up to the present - overall allowing readers to understand the thinking process of this modern day Michelangelo. It also contains (vs. original) an addedchapter on Jobs' illness and thoughts on Apple's future.Apple's future.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I have to admit that when I went to see it in the theaters I was expecting a different movie.  How it was sold to me was \\"See how it all began\\" which seems to indicate that this is a Star Trek Prequel.  Wrong.  Its a reboot.  They use the same old horse they always ride to get them there too, time travel.  So tired of that in the Trek universe.  Anyway.  Once I got past my initial disappointment and just started watching it for what it was, I did enjoy it.  The actors act how you want them to act, they sound like you want them to sound, and the Enterprise looks like an Apple store threw up all over a chrome factory.  Its slick, well written, and entertaining.  Its just not the prequel they seemed to have promised us.
B000R34V50|5.0|I grew up with the Turtles when they were 1st released. I had EVERY toy, film, cd, ect released!  Then i got old and got more into gurls and beer!;)  The 3rd movie (turtles in time) was horrible.  Thats about when i boxed everything up and ended the turtle phase after years of investing so much money into them.  It was interesting to see they brought back the cartoons...  Years later after the 1st version of the cartoon ended; my wife got me a free ticket to see the premiere movie on a Saturday morning.  I didn't want to see it!  I'm a movie buff; and i was scared i would just be too pissed off about it.  It was refreshing to see all the kids dressed up in turtle costumes!    To my surprise, this movie made me laugh, jump, cry and breath with total excitement!  My wife was just as hype, and she was not a fan of the turtles at all.  THE MOVIE IN MY OPINION TOPPED 300, which came out the exact same year!  Amazing how they bridged the old turtle movie storylines, and created this complete masterpiece!  So many people thought i was crazy for promoting the movie until i got them to see it.  I think it would have made more money if people showed more faith in the movie besides quickly shunning it due to the fact that it was a cartoon, and the new ones cant live up to the hype of the old ones.     Definitely a movie for the collection!  Nickelodeon and Paramount have picked up the rights late this year in 2009.  They better not mess up!  Please make the movie in 2012 continue after TMNT!!! No Reboot of the film please!!!  Reboot the series if you must; but not the film.  you have more than enough to work with!!!  Buy this on blu-ray!!!
B002NPUCP8|4.0|To really appreciate how great Orianthi is, you have to check out a wide array of videos perhaps on YouTube (where I watched a bunch). Witnessing what she is capable of and the sounds out of her guitar...and she's a decent vocalist too for that matter, put me at ease that she is the real deal.    This CD to me can be perceived in a variety of ways, some may say she is just another cookie cutter artist doing commercial pop rock that is oversaturated as it is, that she is being molded into something she is way above. If you judge it by the title track and the According To You single maybe it is, but it does have a edgy rock sound to it for the most part also in places...maybe she was swayed astray a bit for a majority of the CD and it's sounds, but you have to admire her versatility as an artist to create yet another dimension to her catalog. On the surface it seems a bit more polished in places than the \\"Violet Journey\\" CD, to me she has already given us plenty of signs that she is in no way one dimensional.    That all being said, there is alot to like here, \\"According To You\\" is the catchy single with a bit more guitar than the average pop rocker, not really into female artists who do songs like these overall, so I can't tell you what other songs are on those types of albums, but I would assume none of them can handle the guitar like Orianthi, and don't have a bunch of hard rockers mixed into syruppy ballads.    What I like about the Cd is the up tempo rockers for the most part...you've got \\"What's It Gonna Be\\" which reminds me of a young Lita Ford; and there's the intrumental \\"Highly Strung\\" which if you know Steve Vai's work, you can imagine how good this is.   Other favs include \\"Think Like A Man\\", \\"Bad News\\", \\"Suffocated\\", and can't leave out what I believe she said was the first song she wrote after arriving in the States from Australia in \\"Feels Like Home\\" which is a beautiful song that starts slow, and developes nicely, has a nice solo...pretty sure this falls under the \\"not many other of her contemps are gonna do this....this good.      The song \\"God Only Knows\\" is a very good vocal effort I think and a nice song also.       To me there is a difference here that as said you get the real deal doing what many female artists can do only. When many female artists doing similar type music can only stand out front and sing only, how many can handle the guitar, play lead, crank out a quick fill, then launch effortlessly into a paint on the wall melting solo if necessary too?...not (m)any I bet. Orianthi does this as well as anybody, and switch gears to blues rock, or just shred (see her song for Steve Vai)...you name it the sky is the limit to what she may be able to do and accomplish.    Perhaps we need to embrace this talented young woman, and not overlook what is perceived as generic commercial pop rock, and realize just who is doing this in this case.
B0002TKFRM|5.0|Review Equipment: Sennheiser HD515 headphones, and an upgraded X-Fi ExtremAudio (high end op-amp installed for main stereo portion).  Note that I am only reviewing the CD portion, for I do not have the equipment necessary to listen to the SACD portion (which is probably incredible, going by what I've heard so far).  I had the old Phillips CD of this same recording, and this one blows it away. Clarity, definition, everything is perfect. I could not find any flaws, other than a bit of analog whir when turned up on my HD515s, which is not only normal, but perfectly acceptable. This is the definitive version of the disk that got me into classical music a long time ago, and if you want to get into the greatest of musical genres, or want a high-quality supplement for your collection, this is it. At this price, it is an absolute steal.    The recording was made with three microphones, so if it is played with a SACD player, it will use the left, center, and right channels, supposedly giving you an authentic concert experience. I have no reason at all to doubt them, I can't wait to get some equipment capable of utilizing the SACD portion.    Pros: Bleeds quality of a masterful work, even the case is much better than a standard jewel case, can be played in an SACD player for authentic 3 point concert sound.  Cons: None at all.
B001I82RVS|3.0|Simply put, this is the most bizarre, ridiculous, gratuitous, nonsensical movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />The daughter of a murdered police officer, Ruka (Eihi Shiina, the definition of evil in Audition) is a member of a future privatized police force - clad in a cross between ancient samurai gear, high-tech armor and Darth Vader helmets - whose sole purpose is to battle genetically enhanced, cyberpunk villains called engineers.  Told between random commercials promoting wrist-cutting and discouraging seppuku (i.e. hara-kiri), the plotline is peppered with flashbacks, cartoons, and every possible oddity squeezable into a Japanese version of a circus freak-show.  Think Judge Dredd with a ghetto Lucy Liu in place of Sly, mixed with the commercial jingoism of Starship Troopers and a ninja-slave-dog-sword-BDSM-slave-person(?).<br /><br />There is a prostitute killer, an attempt to kill a school yard of children playing soccer, cranium kickball, torture porn and random torture, decapitation of a petty criminal, executions of peaceful protestors, sexual perversion, and a midget devil.  If severed limbs are your thing, then you'll be in heaven.  If generic gore, volcanic blood, and randomly inserted exploding heads tickle your fancy, then I recommend a viewing.  If campy horror turns you on, this will be your Nicholas Sparks.  If a Japanese dude doing a poor imitation of the Michael Jackson crotch grab as he walks towards a fetishist sex club where he gets Bobbit-ized, later attacked by a gatormaid, and grows a loin-cannon, well, be honest, that's not anybody's \\"thing.\\"<br /><br />This movie is meant to be as over-the-top gory and odd as possible; it succeeds.  Thumbs up, I think.  You get the point.
B002R0F3Q2|4.0|Alicia Keys didn't really go into that much of a different direction with this album but there are a lot of good songs on the CD. \\"Love Is Blind\\" is one of my favorites.

We have changed your purchase quantity to the maximum allowable.\\"<br />Whuh? Amazon *doesn't* want me to buy stuff?  Are they freakin' kidding?  That doesn't sound capitalistic.<br /><br />How else am I suppose to share the message that our society is decaying through materialism, if I can't sent this to all my M---F--- friends?  This is some B---S---!  I guess my best friend I've known high school is going to have to get the The Mountain Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee.  But not from Amazon.
B002T9H2L0|1.0|I'm so happy I endured watching a movie about fictional characters and learning everything about them. Is this ever going to help me in real life, in some kind of historical aspect? No. Is it entertaining? No. Does it make for a bad movie? Yes.IF you want to know the story of a bunch of ficitonal characters that really are, strait to the point, boring, I'd recommend this movie to you. I'd also recommend this movie to you if your IQ is below 2. I could give this movie five stars if they never made it.         They must have paid Brad Pitt 25 dollars for his whole 20 minutes in the movie. If you saw the preview for this movie you where horribly lied to. If you think this is going to be a blood, guts, gore, (a good movie about killing Nazis) your wrong. Its really just one big story that has nothing to do with what they told us the movie was actually going to be. I was going to resell the Blue Ray copy I bought, but then I felt like I was a bad person. On a personal note, Blue Rays do not burn blue in the fire place.
B000E1ZK3M|4.0|If you love Full Metal Jacket, you'll probably like this movie. Many of the scenes are redone shot for shot to be just like Full Metal Jacket. It starts with a basic training scene. Later there is a scene where the soldiers are interviewed by the media, similar to FMJ. The storyline had to be different for a different war, but I still see this as a remake.    The HD DVD has excellent picture quality!

0316010669|4.0|It is a really interesting book with good ideas in it about snap shot judgements and making decisions quickly. The only thing that I feel that it lacks is the application. There are different examples of how other people made decisions but it lacks information when it comes to how we can use these types of techniques in our every day lives. Good book though
B002HWRYJE|4.0|If you're a fan of the 'Star Trek' series, you'll love this movie. I was not a Trekkie, but had always wondered how Dr. McCoy got his nickname, why Spock and Kirk became such close friends, and whats the deal with Scotty. I've already lent the DVD out to friends and family as they wanted to see it as well.
B002R0F3Q2|2.0|Society is about to collapse, with horrible living conditions and misery overtaking the globe, so you'd think a sensitive \\"artist\\" would be moved enough to say something about it. Alicia Keys had never uttered a word on the subject, and with this new disc, still hasn't . She cries a lot about having a boo boo on her heart, being alone, being sad, being kinda sad, being sorta sad, and wondering when she'll be sad again. Ok, she has feelings, what a surprise, how fascinating. How does she feel about living on an abused, spent, dying planet? We'll probably never know, 'cause we're running out of time for her or anyone else to express themselves. The beautiful and talented Sade has composed and performed some songs that deal with this condition, often very directly. So it's not as though people don't want to hear about it. No, Alicia, like the majority of her fans, lives in a dream bubble of fantasy and delusion, where the only thing that matters is her precious little heart. The bubble's just about to burst, and it's going to be very tragic and sad. Sadder than Miss Keys can seem to imagine. The suffering and chaos that is quickly approaching will make Alicia's adolescent heartbreaks seem so silly and trivial. Not that she or anyone else can really do much to stop what's coming, but at least don't keep pretending that some very horrible stuff isn't heading our way very fast. You can disagree with me but you'd be wrong. Peace. (as if that's ever gonna happen)
0670018651|4.0|Knowing relatively little about perfume, I found this book amazing. Before last year, I was, like many women, loyal to a few perfumes. A friend who is really into perfume was moving and gave me scores of samples. I could try a new perfume every day for months, literally. Which is what I decided to do. Since there were so many, I thought I would write a little in my journal about each one, since I could never remember all the names and what I like or disliked about each.  However, this presented me with a problem. The language I had to describe the perfumes was lacking. How often can you use the word \\"sophisticated\\" before it has no meaning? Luckily I came across this book around the same time. Of course I knew that some perfumes were florals. But reading this book was the first time I had heard of chypres, or knew which perfumes were Orientals, or the extent to which modern fragrances are synthetic.  For someone who knows little about perfume, like me, this book is a revelation. It's like being in school somewhat--you get history lessons, chemistry, psychology.  That said, if you are already knowledgable about perfume, this probably isn't useful. And it might be upsetting, inexplicable or even offensive to judge from some of the other reviews.  Over all, trust your own nose. Some of the perfumes the authors rave about here I find dreadful. Poison for example. They rate this as a masterpiece; personally, I think the only place to wear this is at home, alone. As long as you don't have any pets. If you want to expose yourself to this, fine. Exposing other living creatures to it is wrong. Wearing it in public is just sadistic and cruel.  Then there's Jicky, and Mitsouko, both of which the authors swoon over. I find the idea of Jicky (a perfume made continuously since 1889) interesting. It must be quite good if people have been willing to buy it for so long. Mitsouko is listed by both authors as the perfume they would choose if they could only wear one perfume ever again.  I obtained samples of both, expecting amazing things. I was underwhelmed and surprised at being so. Neither was horrible, but neither were the transcendant experience I expected after reading about them here.   Yes, the tone is bitchy. I find that amusing, you may not. Chacun a son gout.
B002PMV9FG|2.0|The DVD publication is exceptionally poor with respect to image quality (I'm using an HDMI at 1080i connection with relatively new DVD player and LCD TV.  No such problem with any other DVDs).  It's much too dark and required setting TV brightness and backlight to maximum values; which tends to be a bit washed-out. If you don't, many parts of the movie are black.   Several other sections are actually grainy in HD! Sound is mediocre.  Theatrical release quality was obviously much compromised (maybe the Blu-ray is better?).      The movie attempts to combine multiple plot threads and coming-of-age for the teenagers.  A very poor attempt that comes off with many loose fragments and distractions.  Unlike the other movies in the series, plot coherency is all but lost. Harry Potter fans may be able to put things together from the book, but others will find this movie impossible to follow.  The movie also assumes you've seen the previous movies so you know the characters and will likely buy the next so this one will actually finish.     Worst of the Harry Potter movies. Hopefully the next will improve.
0316286850|5.0|This book is very informative and fun to read as well. Kevyn has many faces in this book, some famous and some friends. Wonderful before and after pictures with nice stories about each person.Nice stories about how each person met Kevyn, or feels about him. Photos of everyday, evening and extreme makeup. Shots of famous faces Kevyn turned into other famous faces (Lisa Marie Presley as Marilyn Monroe). Very easy to follow the steps needed to create whatever you are looking for. I always wondered how showgirls/guys had those extreme eyebrows for stage..but what did they do the rest of the week at work with those eyebrows? Now I know how they do it! Different skin types are addressed and I loved the shading tricks with foundation. Most looks can be created using what you already own, the book doesnt make you feel like you have \\"the wrong stuff\\". Great book for everyone, beginners and experienced.
0385737947|2.0|Others have compared this novel to \\"Lord of the Flies\\" because it is a survial-mode group of boys, trying to figure how to live together in \\"the maze\\".  I think that \\"Lord of the Flies\\" was less about survival-mode, and more about how humans relate to one-another, a much more complex story told, based on a premise /backdrop built to illuminate same.    This is more about circumstance, and survival and the unraveling of this mystery.  It drags us blind, kicking and screaming to it's \\"revelations\\".    As anticipated, the Maze\\" is pretty much foretelling what and why these young people are here.  And, as expected, the answer leaves this book open-ended enough for a #2 to come.  Yes it's a \\"dark\\" book, but that doesn't necessarily make it good.    I think this could translate better as a film script, with exciting visuals and foreboding music and special effects, as the humanity of these characters are never truly explored to any satisfaction, nor are they very likable.    Just my .02 for free.  ##

0385504225|1.0|Although Mr. Brown can create momentum and suspense, The Lost Symbol bored me to death.   The last act was an insult to my intelligence.
0451457994|2.0|The writing is a little awkward and doesn't flow particularly well. Clarke would have done better speculating in a nonfiction book what the future of space exploration would be like, but in a novel where you have to include plot and character development, it's a failure. Not surprisingly, the mundane actions of the \\"major\\" characters are described in utmost detail to explain how things such as walking will be different. This is interesting, but not enough to sustain readers' interest.<br /><br />Clarke sometimes goes out of his way to explain the physics of the future. His science is sound except for the human capability to survive in vacuum. The plot lacks depth and is slow to develop, and the only real exciting part of the novel is when HAL rebels against the crew of Discovery. You never develop a repoire with the major characters because they do not really matter in the story; they are just set pieces to Clarke's theme of the obelisk initiating evolution. The last part of the book, like the movie, is a complete waste, nothing more than a description of a changing vista before the astronaut's eyes.

B000VUDSH6|4.0|I love jackie chan movies, he's my idol, but my favorites aren't the old school kung fu movies my favorites are the ones in the 90's where he speaks in english limiting what he can say but opening up his physical comedy like in Rumble in the Bronx, Who am I, or even Mr Nice Guy. In those movies his personality differentiates him from other kung fu stars like Jet Li(who are all kickin butt and are a dime a dozen). That's not to say i don't like his all out fight flicks like the second drunken master, but i don't really like his old school flicks like the fearless hyena where his charisma is covered up. I say all this because i really enjoyed Robin B Hood and if you are of the same opinion as i am you will like it to. Sure its plot is absurd even way more so than the look-a-like Vin Diesel movie this reminds me of. Sure most of the things that happen are hardly pluasible, but plot and plausibility are hardly what i watch jackie chan movies for. I didn't like his ultra serious roles like in Crime Story as much as i like him snowboarding off a mountain onto a helicopter into a frozen lake like in first strike. If your not trying to find a jackie chan movie like schindler's list which i argue would be more absurd than anything else, but want to see an over the top enjoyable true jackie chan movie with some truly spectacular stunts for his age(which doesn't seem to show in this movie as it did in Rush Hour 3) with cheesy jokes this is the one. If you want the best jackie chan movie to show to children, this is also probably the one(if you don't count kung fu panda. But if you are trying to watch an all out brawl with some humor avoid this one and go for legend of the drunken master, the police storys', rumble in the bronx, or for just one pretty awesome fight scene Gorgeous will do. If you want a movie where he is trying to win an oscar, well i don't know why you liked him in the first place.
B000JVSUS4|1.0|It dosn't matter what they do with this movie. Unless they burn all of them it will still be the worst historical play on a US tradgity ever made. People who like this hours and hours of tripe really need to think about they're lives. You can't be to intellegent if this cast seems to good, or fair or the story is realistic to you. This is one of the worst movies I had to sit through. This movie drags, the story is false and could be more fake(the pathetic love story) and the lousy acting all make this a terrible movie. My one star dosn't even account the this takes three and half hours of your life. I would give this negitive five stars! And counting the two days worth of additional footage it should be banned! The cast should never work again for this.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|The dialogue and story are ok, but the cinematography is wonderful - Panavision from the 1960s can't be beat - and vintage F1 cars are even better. Spectacular crash scene and live race footage is amazing! A must have for any F1 fan. Digitally remastered is 110% better than the VHS version.
0143105426|5.0|My copy of P & P had pages falling out so I browsed for a replacement and I really liked this cover.<br /><br />I really love the whole new look Penguin Classic Deluxe has going on.
B001AKJ97O|5.0|I am amazed that Adele isn't more popular.  I listen to all music but country.  This album is sexy and the lyrics are intriguing. It's lounge-like vibe is great to chill to.  I recommend everyone who likes chill music to get this!!! It has become one of my personal favorites!! I want more!!
B00133KFGW|5.0|This is a fantastic and inspirational movie of how a deep and determined desire can be realized with unstoppable determination to follow your dreams and make them come true.  I love this movie especially at this time in my life when it really speaks to me!!!!
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|This is a marvelous film, another magical movie adventure from the genius of Hayao Miyazaki, I would highly recommend it to everyone, so happy that the dvd will be coming out in March, and for the person who wondered if it was the version seen in the theater - yes, note that the studio is Disney, it will be the in English dubbed with Cate Blanchett, Frankie Jonas, Noah Lindsey Cyrus and others, Disney/Buena Vista does the distribution and dubbing for the Miyazaki films released in English, thankfully under the condition that not a iota is changed ~ wonder what the next Miyazaki gift will be.  Go see this film, colors are fabulous, story line is thoughtful and fun, a treat for the whole family, you can't go wrong with a Ghibli film! Check them all out ~
B002ECJZ76|4.0|Imagine a highly authentic, Charles Dickens-style epic story about a young orphaned boy who is raised by a small village, apprentices with a harsh but skillful woodworker and, anonymously making carved toys for people out of sheer generosity, becomes the spirit of Santa Claus in his afterlife. It's not as somber as it sounds, but it's also not a peppy Rankin/Bass look at the legend with happy elves and a colorful workshop.<br /><br />My daughter was only marginally interested in watching this film yet she was drawn in totally by its compelling storytelling and fresh look at the legend. She's 12, so this might be a film for older kids and adults rather than tots. The musical score is fantastic and the photography, filmed on location in Finland, is breathtaking. There's a lengthy bonus feature all about the physical extremes endured by the cast and crew in order to make this unusual film. Interestingly, the cast and filmmakers are subtitled in the documentary so you get to hear some of the voices without the dubbing.<br /><br />The film is dubbed, by quite well, especially by John Turturro as the woodworking master who seems frightening at first and becomes sympathetic later, but always in a very belivable way. I could not get away from the resemblance of the onscreen actor to Gene Simmons!<br /><br />This is a fine drama, not a whimsical fantasy, about the events that might have led up to Santa becoming \\"Santa.\\"
B002MRROKS|5.0|Nirvana at their best. The DVD is the best part of this package. The CD is excellent for the concert on the go, but of course, nothing beats the visual and audio for truly enjoying a concert. Not to mention, a few parts because of practicality were left off the CD which were part of the DVD.<br /><br />As I watched the show, I found myself swept up by the pure energy that is Nirvana. Unfortunately, I never got to see them live. This DVD is what I have been waiting for: an opportunity to see Nirvana live. And it is so good, that I really felt like I was sitting in a luxury box off stage from the band enjoying the concert as if I were there in the flesh.<br /><br />The energy is incredible. I was drumming on my floor right from the start and continued right up until the end.<br /><br />This DVD / CD package is absolutely worth every penny. Especially if you never got to see this incredible band live. With this recording, now you can.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Since I have nothing original to add to all the glowing reviews, I just decided to give Firefly a 6th star, someone else can give it 7 after me. Anyway my two bits, is as follows: I'm always years behind on watching Sci-fi shows. So when I do my research I generally look for shows that are raved about by the fans (I just ordered the Farscape complete series last weekend), well this shows cup runneth over with praises. It doesn't disappoint. Buy it, borrow, rent it, etc., you'll be glad.
B000CZ0Q5W|5.0|To say that this is a landmark album is not, in my opinion, an overstatement in any way. This album was pivotal for PMG. It marked their departure from the stricture of ECM's somewhat repressive \\"get in, lay down the tracks and get out\\" recording practices and their debut on David Geffen's label. One of the first and few jazz bands to record for Geffen, PMG were catapulted, almost overnight, onto a much larger stage to rave reviews and sold out tour dates. If I were to voice a criticism of this album it would be that it just isn't long enough. This is the musical equivalent of the perfect summer sunset at the beach. You just don't want it to end. It's just that good!     It is 1987 and once again, nearly a decade after my conversion as a Jazz fan with the first \\"Group\\" album, I am rendered speechless and I feel a chill run down my spine. Just like the first time that saw Vincent van Gogh's \\"Irises\\" in a museum instead of a book, I am amazed.  From the anticipatory departure of Minuano to the mystery and sensuousness of \\"So It May Secretly Begin,\\" through the Evocative chugging, throbbing emotion of \\"Last Train Home\\" then the controlled blast of \\"Third Wind\\" and eventually settling down to the last flickering embers of \\"In Her Family.\\" The experience was visceral and revelatory. I instantly replayed the entire album. I've been hitting the replay button on this one now for over twenty years. It is still the only album that I must listen to at least two or three times before I can move on to something else. I defy you to listen to this album once and not be compelled to hear it again immediately, if for no other reason than simply to listen, in shear amazement, to the blistering (yet somehow cool and understated) solo of \\"Third Wind.\\" I'm listening to to it now as I write this and once again the hair on the back of my neck is standing up. This band is so tight it almost makes your ears pop!    I still play this for my few uninitiated friends who love to make fun of that \\"jazz stuff\\" that I listen to. I crank the volume as my captive listener is assailed with yet another of my \\"crazy jazz tunes.\\" They smile and nod wearily. They indulge me as they would an overly enthusiastic child, but slowly, as Pat's irrepressibly buoyant and joyful fret work begins to cast it's melodic spell (you can almost hear him smiling as he plays) a change starts to come over them. Lyle's shimmering piano solos transcend their patronization. Paul Wertico and Steve Rodby loosen their resistance with their tight rhythms. Armando Marcal shakes the bones of all those wonderful percussive toys and David Blamires and Mark Ledford contribute their remarkable vocal work... and then... it happens; I watch bemused as the once reticent listener, almost against their will, begins to be seduced by this wonderful music. I watch as their toe or finger starts to tap, their head starts to bob slightly, almost absentmindedly and then, as \\"Last Train Home\\" rolls into the station, it's all over but the shouting. Forget about it... By the time \\"In Her Family\\" comes to an end I'm indulging their new found enthusiasm for jazz with a smile and a nod.    This is one for the books my friends.
B000068NOV|5.0|I purchased this as a \\"piece of flair\\" for my home theatre, and not only was I not disappointed, I was amazed at the attention to detail, and quality of construction put into this model.  Both doors open, showing a well modelled interior complete with flux-capacitor, and time machine interface.  The hood opens to show what would be the \\"trunk\\" of a de-lorean (not much to see in there, but it was nice that they made it open and close) and the best part is, there is a lever on the bottom of the car that flips the wheels down into \\"flying mode\\" like at the end of BttF I, and all throughout BttF II.  The entire body is Die-Cast metal and gives it a good heft.  I would caution that you do NOT buy this for kids to play with, though, as there are some fine detailed pieces, like the windshield wipers, which would break of very easily in a kids hands.    Based on the quality of this model, I now plan to buy all four versions of SunStart BttF De-Loreans !  Of the four versions of this model, if you only buy one, buy THIS one.  It is the only one featured in all three movies, and is the most recognizable and iconic.
B002UZCJ8Y|4.0|I love the concept of having physical avatars you can go out into the world in, have fun, do whatever, without any worry of getting hurt.  That alone makes this movie brilliant.  Add a murder mystery into that, with some crazy smart hacker who finds a way to hurt the real person behind their surrogate, and its game on.  This movie is full of twists and hidden plots.  There are plenty of got you moments and I loved Bruce Willis in this.  Not his best movie, not the best movie in general, but still pretty darn good.
B00009R6J7|4.0|Great to have.  Fits the hot shoe better than the cheaper model I previously had.  Works well and the quality is good.  The reason for 4 stars is that it is a little pricey.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|After reading the Sookie Stackhouse series, I decided to take a look at the tv series. I really enjoyed the adaption! It's a very good take on the books. Some details are left out but overall it's a very good interpretation. I would definitely recommend to first read the books and then watch the series. I love the actors! They did a good job casting. The Chemistry between Sookie and Bill is great!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I really liked this Star Trek movie. Lots of action and the special effects are wonderful. This is a must see!
0385335997|5.0|Voyager shows us the journey of Jamie and Claire after their heartbreaking separation at the end of Dragonfly in Amber. What occurred during those twenty years? This novel jumps form 18th century Scotland with Jamie and current 1968 with Claire. Both are struggling to live without each other. This novel is really interesting because for the first time we have Jamie's point of view which I really enjoyed. I loved their reunion! It was so good and touching that I've read that part of the novel at least three times!<br /><br />I didn't like the fact that Jamie and Claire were separated for so long. However, I think it adds to their character development because it was interesting to see them get to know each other again. I think Voyager is a better read than the second novel because we see both Jamie's and Claire's point of view. Plus, it was a little more interesting than the second novel in my opinion. Voyager is definitely worth the read if you've loved the series so far! I'm excited to continue on their journey!
0143038419|2.0|I've read some of the reviews here and had many of the same impressions as others.  I found Gilbert's so-called zingers and one-liners a turn-off; it's clear she was going for \\"zany\\" as a writing style.  I was also irritated by her self-absorption and tendency to burst into hours of tears at the slightest thing.    I can't say I didn't learn anything about the countries she visited, Disneyfied as they seemed.  But my real problem with the whole story is that virtually all Elizabeth Gilbert came across were such warm, giving people who couldn't do enough for her.  How is that possible?  From all the tender Italian guys she hung around with in Rome to the Indians and foreigners at the ashram to the practically caricature villagers she met in Bali, they all welcomed her with open arms, gave her food, advice, medical care, companionship...you name it.  I started doubting the veracity of all her encounters.  And really, how could anyone verify her stories?      I don't believe she never came across people who were mean to her, who didn't help or who were indifferent to her quest for selfhood.  And if she did meet those people and chose not to include them in the book, why not?      In the end it almost seems like all that travelling and soul searching was just a quest for a new man, which is how she ends the book, all happy with some guy who just worships the ground she walks on and can't stop telling her how much he loves her.  Right.
0385335989|5.0|Wow! I thought that Voyager was amazing but this book almost tops it! I was worried that after Voyager the story wouldn't be as exciting. Wow was I wrong! Drums starts with Jamie and Claire start their lives in the new world. This book switches from Jamie and Claire's life in America 1769 and Brianna and Roger in the present 1969. I was unsure that I would like reading from Brianna's and Roger's point of view since I love Jamie and Claire so much. However, I really liked reading from their perspective. It was interesting to see how Brianna is coping after her father's death and mother's departure through time. You see a lot more of Frank in this book too: the good and the bad. The end will leave you shocked! You think you know the story and then something surprises you! I would suggest that you read the outlandish companion to help with the ending because it can be a little confusing. Diana Gabaldon is an amazing author! Can't wait to read more!
B002BSHXJA|4.0|I will keep this short or I will just reiterate what others have already have said.<br /><br />Well finally the decision was made to get the Mono box set. I really was more interested in this than the stereo box, plus I got the CD's of the albums I wanted in stereo. This is marked improvement sound quality =-wise. You hear The Beatles as a band and a lot of the track seem to have a more \\"in your face\\" presence that the stereo lacks. Plus I noticed no \\"brick walling\\" in the compression department.<br /><br />The whole stereo vs. mono debate is ridiculous in my opinion. At the time these albums were released mono was the main format for pop music in general, AM radios was the way most teenagers heard this music. Only hi-fi enthusiasts and the well off could afford stereo equipment. Actually most of the major labels were still releasing singles in a mono and radio friendly mixes well into the early 70's becuase AM was still thriving.<br /><br />I do have to take one star off becuase of the price. EMI owns these recordings so they are not licensing off another record company so I do understand the logic (outside of greed) why they charge more for the mono than the stereo. Your not getting anything truly \\"new\\". As other have stated it would have been nice for the box set to be released in BluRay or on DVD, like the Neil Young Archives, with the mono and stereo on the same disc with the related singles. They could have fit the five films in there as well, not that would have been worth $260. But for CDs?<br /><br />So if the cost is not an issue, you will be very satisfied. And if you think mono is a waste of money get the stereo. Exercise your freedom of choice
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I have never been a fan of Star Trek.  The show never interested me, so I never made it through an entire episode.  Ever.  My boyfriend, however, is a fan.  Naturally, when the movie came out, he wanted to go see it, so I said I'd go with him even though I had major reservations.  I knew nothing about Star Trek other than what pop culture references had taught me.  To my great pleasure, it didn't matter.  The movie started at the beginning and told me everything I needed to know as it progressed.  I'm sure there were some references made that only those who have followed the show would catch, but I found it highly entertaining despite my extremely limited knowledge.  The cast was fantastic, and the breath-taking special effects, action, and humor throughout the movie kept me completely engaged.    I highly recommend this movie!
B002T9H2LK|5.0|Quentin Tarantino had long spoken of his \\"war epic\\" that he had been working on and in late 2008, he unexpectedly announced that he had commenced filming and wanted to release it at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. Upon its debut, it became the highest-grossing film of his career, opened to rave reviews, and the typical fanfare that greets just about any Tarantino film. Inglourious Basterds is not a war epic in the traditional sense...It's a war fantasy, in which Tarantino doesn't let the constraints of reality keep him from telling the story he wishes to tell. It's a large-scale epic, separated into five chapters, with a large cast, and a great villain.    Chapter one is called \\"Once Upon a Time...In Nazi-Occupied France.\\" Colonel Hans Landa of the SS (Christoph Waltz), nicknamed \\"the Jew Hunter,\\" stops by the dairy farm of Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet) to inquire about a missing family of Jews whom Landa believes LaPadite is hiding in his home. This is an explosive opening scene, beautifully shot by cinematographer Robert Richardson, and absolutely bristling with suspense. The banter between Waltz and Menochet, coupled with the subtle musical score is a brilliant example of filmmaking, as well as a great way to establish the character Hans Landa. Meanwhile, we have the brief and understated performance by Menochet. In the scheme of things, with as many speaking roles as this movie has, Menochet has a relatively insignificant role in the film, and yet he has a rather remarkable impact. He lets us in to empathize with him as Landa slowly breaks him down.    Chapter two introduces us to the \\"Basterds,\\" a group whose mission is to spread fear throughout the German military by ruthlessly killing Nazi's. They're lead by Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), who leads the colorful characters through Germany, killing and scalping any Nazi's they come across. They've become so feared by the German military, even Hitler is aware of them.     While there are 5 chapters, its only chapter three I'm going to elaborate any further on...This chapter, entitled \\"German Night in Paris,\\" introduces us to Shosanna (Melanie Laurent), the surviving Jewish girl of chapter one, who operates a cinema in France under an assumed name. Shosanna is approached by Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), a celebrated German war hero, who asks Shosanna to host a movie premiere of his movie \\"Nation's Pride,\\" a movie premiere that will be attended by the top powers of the Third Reich, including Hitler himself.    Of course, there are many more characters and many more actors. In setting up his film with chapters, Tarantino has made a film that, overall, has more of an episodic nature than a cohesive story. There is no main character in the film and many of the film's characters never meet each other and, really, it's only Hans Landa that really holds it all together. Don't be fooled by the theatrical trailers which portray the \\"Basterds\\" as the main characters...They actually have a relatively small amount of screen time. Other actors include the lovely Diane Kruger as Bridget von Hammersmark, a German actress who's serving as a spy for the British. A surprising appearance by Mike Myers (yes, Austin Powers himself) has bothered some and I would have preferred a different choice myself, but he doesn't exactly bother me. It's just so noticeably Myers and he's so campy with his role it sort of breaks the spell woven by Inglourious Basterds momentarily.    Many of this film's detractors cite it's casting much of the time, particularly Myers and director Eli Roth as the Basterds' Bear Jew. Roth is convincing physically as the Bear Jew and the maniacal look in his eyes (he's probably stoned) work well, but whenever he's required to speak (not very often) I didn't buy it. But he doesn't ruin the film by any stretch and, yes, he likely only got cast because he's friends with Tarantino...But, oh well. He does a decent job. Pitt is fantastic as Lt. Aldo Raine and it's his larger-than-life persona that makes this performance so effective and entertaining. If Pitt is campy in the role, it just fits well into the whole scheme of things. Many director's want you to suspend your disbelief and accept a film as a reality...Tarantino wants you to know you're watching a movie. Pitt will not win an Oscar for his performance, but I found his portrayal both compulsively watchable and hilarious. Finally, Waltz plays Hans Landa so menacingly he deserves all the critical accolades his performance has been met with. Waltz creates such a thoroughly evil, gleeful sociopathic character that is one of Tarantino's greatest creations. Waltz was a German television actor that Tarantino picked for the role and I haven't seen a more impressive supporting performance this year.    The dialogue is typical Tarantino (\\"We ain't in the prisoner-takin' business, we in the killin' Nazi business and, cousin, business is a boomin'\\"), although it's worth noting that much of the dialogue is subtitled. This surprised me when I first saw the film and I can imagine some will be angered by this. A large majority of the film is in a language other than English, but you can still feel the effect of Tarantino's dialogue.    Also very impressive and a huge component of the film is its musical score; one that only Tarantino would use for a World War II epic. Tarantino has always had a gift for picking music for his film and this film is no exception. Despite many of Tarantino's flourishes, this film has the least Tarantino-like feel to it, although I can't quite put my finger on why.    This is not a film for everyone and even fans of war movies and/or Tarantino will be disappointed by it. It's not a perfect film and, while I think it's a great film, I wonder if it would've been greater had Tarantino not rushed into making it.  It's got a brilliant opening scene and a terrific ending (whether it makes complete sense or not) and it further cements Tarantino's status as one of Hollywood's greatest film directors. Inglourious Basterds is one of the best, most entertaining films of 2009; a celebration of cinema and what makes movies so great.    GRADE: A-
B002Y5210G|5.0|I'm LOVE this album! I'm a huge Alicia Keys fan! I like all of her albums. The 3rd 1 was my favorite, but this has such a different feel to it, it's more mature, she's growing as a woman and as an artist.  No artists music should sound the same over and over...
B000002ADT|3.0|I have a much better collection of Blues albums.  This one definitely is not what it is hyped up to be.  I was very disappointed when listening to it.
0756405890|1.0|I did enjoy the beginning of the book to a degree, I chose to rate this a 1 star to offset the stupidly high rating this gets.  It should be more in the 2 star category.  On to the review:    The first and most annoying issue I take with this book is the cliche, terrible, boring, horrendous, blah, meh, anti-lulz, love story crap.    It's bad, it's worse than bad.  It's made for tv drama.  Nay, it's Lifetime Channel bad.  I can't remember where it all went so wrong, but I will tell you this:  Rothfuss is a carnie.  Carnie - A person who devotes part their life to the theater arts or Drama.  I've known many a carnie, I've been to their parties, I've dated their women.  I know a carnie when I see one, I know a carnie when I hear one, I know a carnie when I read a book that one writes.  This guy can't fool me.  He's a carnie.      Once I understood this, it was as if the book was bottle of cola that lost all its fizz.  Not because I am biased towards carnies, or I think less of them, but because I know there is no depth to this story.  It's all show, no go.  He's going to steal everything from other books he's read.  If you've read those books, you've read this one.  This book IS Harry Potter.  It IS a bad Lifetime Drama.      1)  He's inconsistent.  There is so many little things that don't add up, that contradict former things, that make you think WTF?  2)  The main character is Pat Rothfuss - Or at least a version of what he'd like to be.  It goes with the ego-carnie-ism.  It's disgusting really.  If you read about the author, you'll get what I say.  3)  Where the **** is the setting? - I can't express how many times I was WTF is going on?  Where the **** is this taking place?  What does this place look like?  For example.  Some part of the school catches on fire, the reader has no clue where it's at relative to anything, what the inside or outside looks like, how its setup, what it contains, nothing.  OH but he does describe in agonizing detail what some chick was wearing and how her hair looked and what she was doing.  IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIRE!  But he couldn't be bothered to tell us much else.  I almost threw the book at the wall.  And also, isn't this supposed to be a story from memory?  PUHLEEEEEEEZ  4)  It's pretentious- Big time.  It feels more like a 'Hey look at me, I'm writing a novel' than any real desire to take the reader on a journey.  You can't relate to any characters, and you sure as heck can't relate to any setting (they are meager).      5)  Can't relate to any characters-  A protagonist, AT 13 YEARS OF AGE NO LESS, can do it all.  Has the mind of God, super strong, plays music better than everyone, stumbles into a bad Lifetime Channel romance (I know i'm beating a dead horse, but the love story is SOOOOOOO bad), can virtually do everything and anything.  The end of the story should be a la Goku in DBZ GT.    6)  Confusing magic system -  I should say I have no idea what the magic system is because he either did a poor job of explaining it or its just that ambiguous.  Rather, at first I thought I understood, but then when it gets put into practice I just don't understand its boundaries, its weaknesses, why somethings work, why somethings don't, what it is essentially that's going on.  Where the **** is all this double and triple mind stuff that got hammered at you in the first of the book?  So confusing its worthless.  7)  Complete lack of detail.  I have no mental image what anyone looks like.  No idea of the dress, no idea of the hairstyle, no idea of nuthin'.  I like a little bit of that to stimulate the imagination.  But most of this book is little Pat being a mental demigod spouting pretentious bull faster than Floyd Mayweather Jr.  There is almost no feeling of immersion.  Which, granted, detail is difficult when writing in first person but after 500 pages there is no excuse.    8)  Character interactions -  The worst, most grueling part of this book is the character interactions and dialogue.   This ishow I KNOW, without a doubt, Pat Rothfuss is a carnie, without even looking up the fact that he took all kinds of theater classes in college.  The characters express WAAAAY too many emotions and the range...the range is unbearable.  It's like everyone in the story is Bi-polar/schizophrenic.  There isn't one real, organic person in the entire book.  They're all like dancing fairies, poorly paraphrasing shakespearian lines of poetry.  Making unnecessary actions, or rather OVER acting.  If that's even possible.  Yes, the characters in a fantasy novel are OVER ACTING!  LMAO!  9) Stupid names - Or rather poorly thought out names for characters.  This is obviously subjective.  But, c'mon, rule #1 to writing a novel - pick a name for the main character that everyone can properly pronounce.  Kvothe?  I say Kuh-Vah-Th.  Apparently its like Quothe- with a bit of a gargle inbetween the Q and the U.   Kvothe sounds cool, Quothe sounds lame.  Many of the female characters have Horse names.  Yes, names typically reserved for horses.  Fela, Mola, Reta.  I rest my case.  10)  Unsympathetic sympathy - No not the confusing magic system (weird name for that too huh?) the fact that every major trauma was sort of read like, meh.  Next.  It lacked a real attachment to the main character.  It lacked the depth of what an event like that would really do.  It lacked details of the events.  There are entirely too many unsympathetic sympathy events.  Quothe is like the most luckiest/unluckiest God ever created.  At the risk of sounding foolish, it's contrived.  A Fantasy novel being contrived?  NO...  Well just the events are so seemingly out of place and too convienent, it's like he wanted that feel of a character that's \\"been through it\\" without \\"going through it\\", it's like he took a shortcut.  He definitely took a shortcut in how badass the character is out the baby maker, but even his greatest most obvious influence Harry Potter had at least an interesting progression.  Measured just right.  Not thrown in as if it was a fast pitch baseball.  No tact, no finesse, no bueno.      It's not all bad though, but someone paid those good authors to say those nice things about him.  Because I doubt they read the book.      10 things I hate about your book Pat.  I won't be buying your next one.  I won't even pick it up off the ground, even if there's no one around for 50 miles.  I won't even stoop down to pick it to throw it away.

B002P5XXR0|5.0|I have looked at many reviews about this soundtrack and people have complained that Horner had a year to work on this and he did not deliever. I am going to have to disagree. I feel that Horner succeded all my expecations and much more. This soundtrack is his best one to date. Sure there are hints of material used in previous scores but he is not the only composer to do this. This soundtrack has everything a horner fan could ask for plus much more. The themes are amazing, the action music is top notch and the love theme brings tears to my eyes. Horner has written some great scores over the past and he has added another one to his chain. Bravo mister Horner
B002OB9KPE|3.0|I usually have my iPod in shuffle mode, but there's a selected number of albums in my collection that I occasionally just have to hear from start to finish. \\"Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\" is one of them, as well as Frost's more recent classic, the incredible \\"Milliontown\\".    The first two Transatlantic CDs also fit into that mold. Once in awhile, I just get a hankerin' to hear them from top to bottom. Unfortunately, I don't feel the same love for \\"Whirlwind\\". It's solid, full-bodied, orchestral prog with lots of great moments. If you can't get enough of the other TA releases, it's well worth the investment. But I don't see it ever progressing beyond shuffle mode for me...the magic just isn't there.    On \\"Whirlwind\\", rather than weave the concept into extended suites, the songs are of more modest length, although true to form as in past efforts you'll hear reprises of the main themes to help bind them together. But overall the music is less cohesive from song to song than prior TA suites. This band is just outstanding at returning to the most inspiring thematic material at just the right moment, though -- I think that's one of the things I like best about them. Instrumentally, it doesn't vary in texture and sonic quality too much from \\"Bridge\\" or \\"SMTP:e\\", though the keyboards tend to be more orchestral and there's less of that classic Hammond and Oberheim solo synth lead sound. There's all sorts of \\"leadership-of-the-band-on-this-one\\" conjecture discussed to date, but in my opinion \\"Whirlwind\\" sounds a bit more \\"Flower Kings\\" and less \\"Spock's Beard\\" to me than prior TA efforts. In full disclosure, I am a bigger Morse-era \\"Beard\\" fan than \\"Flower Kings\\" so odds are that aspect is also coloring my judgment. Notwithstanding, I really do like the music on the first disc and the overwhelming majority of TA fans will NOT be disappointed.      Unfortunately, the bonus CD is weak. Others have mentioned that this effort seems like Neal Morse was holding the reins, but I getjust the opposite vibe from the original material on the bonus disc in particular: first two songs are definitely \\"Flower Kings\\", and it's evident they are all much less of a collaborative effort. My impression is that these are songs that definitely didn't fit into the \\"Whirlwind\\" theme, but that band members' wanted tacked onto the release. The net effect is side three of ELP's \\"Works\\" (...you remember: the Carl Palmer side...). The covers do nothing for me, bringing little if anything to the table in the way of reinterpretation. Jordan Rudess did a far superior job of reinterpreting classic prog on his \\"Road Home\\" CD, though it had a few flaws as well. At least he started with great songs and succeeded on many levels in reinventing them in his own style. I'm not sure what the band's intentions were with this mixed bag of songs, both prog and non-prog: In my opinion, if you're going to cross genres and slap a Santana or America song next to Genesis' \\"Giant Hogweed\\" you ought to weave something damn original into the song -- otherwise it becomes a throwaway, which in large part is exactly what the bonus disc is. Several reviewers have held \\"Hogweed\\" in high regard, but I don't think it holds a candle to the original, so why bother? In all candor, though, I must admit that I have never been a \\"cover afficianado.\\" To me, they rarely, if ever, live up to the originals, so again I have to ask: why bother? If I want covers, I'll head down to a lounge on Saturday night. In this case, I don't believe enough time was spent in reinventing these songs to give TA ownership of them; the transcriptions are just too straightforward. [Transatlantic fanbois: please no insulting reply comments...your \\"negative helpfulness\\" checkmark will be quite sufficient, thank you. Remember, this is my opinion, and you're equally welcome to your own...]    Before writing this review, I read every other review for this CD -- all 39 at this point in time. I firmly believe every one of those reviewers would have loved to give this CD a five-star review, as would I. And I believe that the talented members of Transatlantic did their utmost to deliver their own musical vision, hoping prog fans like myself would appreciate it on its own terms and love it as much as the other CDs. For whatever reason, that's not the case this time around for me.    As a side note, there's been a lot of references to Neal Morses' religious proclivities in other reviews. I'm not spiritual in the least, but I have to say the lyrical content did not bother me in the least. No more religiously overt than \\"Supper's Ready\\", and of course \\"Foxtrot\\" is another CD I'll play start to finish any day of the week.    I'd give \\"Whirlwind\\" a solid four-plus stars without the bonus disc, but feel as though the weakness of this second disc has lowered the bar significantly. If I had bought ONLY the second disc under the guise of a new Transatlantic release I would have been sorely let down.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|We searched all over in stores for the dvd of the Lady and the Tramp and finally contacted amazon.    We had several opportunities to acquire the desired dvd and chose a source which had good ratings from satisfied customers.    After ordering, we were contacted by the source as well as amazon and they kept us up to date on shipping and delivery dates.      The dvd came in its original store condition and we are very very pleased with the whole process.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|From the first Star Trek film through the various TNG outings, many had good attributes, but none could be called a \\"really good story\\".  The latest prequel is an exceptionally well done, thoroughly entertaining production.  Not only is it visually intriguing, but the character development, plot line and fun references to the original series are all top notch.    Heck, I was embarrassed to tell anyone that I had a copy of Nemesis.  This one is near-perfect!    Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Simon Pegg (sp?) are perfectly cast.  Bones' replacement has the look and the vocal intonation down to a fine science (sorry - have forgotten the actor's name and am too lazy to look it up).    A must for any Trekkie, and probably should be in most collections of any sci-fi junkie.
0312370849|4.0|I really liked the first 75% of this book, but after that it floundered.  The main character became whiney and the story unfocused and unbelievable.  The final so called surprise was hardly that, since the author broadcast it.  It was still a good book, but should have been a 5 star book like \\"Those Who Save Us\\".
0446691437|4.0|While the writer talks specifically about \\"writer's block\\", the principals taught apply to every aspect of life.  The book is easy to read and very enjoyable.  I plan on reading this book many more times. I would have given it 5 stars, but I didn't care for the profanity.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|I liked most of the songs on this album, but I'm particularly becoming enamored with \\"Alejandro\\" because it sums up what Gaga has done musically.    Let me say first that nothing is original.  No matter what you listen to, you will always hear echoes of another artist or artists.  The question is, can the artist take what has been done and mix it up to make it fresh again?  In the song \\"Alejandro\\", Gaga has taken Ace of Base and mixed it with an ABBA song structure, and then added an addictive rhythm behind it.  And it sounds ten times better than either one!    I cannot stop listening to this album, and I am a 40-year-old heterosexual rock fan!  So many quality songs.  Just go buy it now!
0439023491|3.0|(Please note, spoilers will follow.)<br /><br />One of my biggest problems with Hunger Games was the fact that although the story itself was fascinating, the writing was a bit juvenile. That is not to say that Collins displayed a lack of talent, but rather that the book was aimed towards a more juvenile audience -- something that didn't make much sense to me, as the topic of the book itself is quite gory and (excellently) disturbing. I always had felt that the book had so much more potential if it had been aimed at a different audience -- but, as I am writing a review for Catching Fire and not its predecessor, I will end that there -- though I will say that this same problem did plague Catching Fire.<br /><br />I wanted to enjoy this book. I really did. I was anticipating the rebellion, excited for the action that such a premise offered. After all, Hunger Games had been pretty much packed with action. I had also hoped that Katniss would finally have grown up and made a choice about that rather cliche little love triangle she was facing.<br /><br />Instead, I got the opposite of what I wanted.<br /><br />When it was announced that Katniss would once again have to fight in the Hunger Games, I wasn't too surprised, and I was far from happy. Much of this book is simply a rehash of the events of book one, minus the wonder and the anticipation of the games. Where Katniss was once in awe over the luxuries of the capital, she is now sad and angry and scared -- along with everybody else. Once again we have to sit through the rather extensive descriptions of Katniss getting dolled up, of the Capitol's gourmet food, of the Games themselves. It's as if someone took book 1, and painted it slightly darker.<br /><br />The love triangle, at this point, is beyond frustrating. On one page, Katniss is positive that she is in love with Gale...and on the next, she craves Peeta. This happens more times than I can count. I understand that the girl can't choose between the two, given the circumstances at hand, but really...enough already! We get it. She likes them both, and they both like her. Obviously she will make a decision at one point. We don't need it shoved down our throats at every turn.<br /><br />Katniss' character itself was a bit more annoying. At the same time that she is indecisive with her feelings for Gale and Peeta, she simply can never make up her mind on what she wants to do. One moment she wants to run away, and the next she decides she has to stay and fight. A moment later still, she'll want to submit to the Capitol, and in the next, she wants to host a rebellion. The constant changing was really quite annoying, and resulted in the book being filled with nothing more than a lot of fluff.<br /><br />As for the ending, while I felt it was a bit expected, I was excited. Finally, something's happening! And, of course, just when the book gets exciting...we get stuck with that \\"end of part two\\" crap. I hated it in book one, and I hated it once again. I suppose it's a good way to get us in the mood to read the third novel, but a touch more subtlety would go a long way.<br /><br />Overall, this book gets 3 stars. It's certainly a page turner...but I just wish it had given more. The concept of the trilogy is really quite enticing, and I look forward to reading the third book -- hopefully it won't disappoint.ircumstances at hand, but really...enough already! We get it.

B002R0F3Q2|5.0|\\"The Element of Freedom\\" is her best, if not equal to \\"Songs in A Minor.\\" The concept of freedom is indeed seen throughout the album, with the exception of her song with Beyoncé, whether it be from a boyfriend/girlfriend, money, etc. and starting anew! Well worth the wait and a nice improvement from \\"As I Am.\\"
0395389496|5.0|Printed in 1985, The Polar Express has been read to children all over. It is a delight to see such quality paintings rendered in such a way that conveys the warmth and emotion of Christmas time. Taken from the view of a young boy who is not sure he still believes in Santa Claus, he is transported to the North Pole via a magical train where he finds out if Santa really exists or not. Splendidly written and detailed paintings make this a Christmas read for children 2-92. I am a collector of Children's books and my 2 1/2 year old loves to look at the pictures as I read to him. This is truly a Christmas classic.

0893860220|5.0|For me, there is a gem of insight on virtually every page of this book, which runs to 534 pages of transcribed conversations between Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj and various questioners. Of course, some of the wisdom the Maharaj imparts repeats itself, but never under identical circumstances.  In fact, at times he contradicts slightly what he has said before, but within the context of the newer conversation, it still makes perfect sense.  But at the heart of his teachings, as I understand them, is the discipline of focusing on the principle \\"I Am\\". That is the starting point from which one expands into a kind of 'beyond awareness' which always exists in the now and does not need to be striven for--though Sri Nisagadatta more or less says that a sincere intentionality can quicken the shift.  The essence of the Awarenes that he talks about is not based on the body, emotions or mind.  There is an almost unnerving simplicity in his method, which seems virtually structureless, without hierarchy; and so some may find his method to realization too undefined.  However, there is an elemental, primal quality to what he teaches, and I think for some people, this is IT.
B0029ZA3H4|5.0|Gary has written a very short book, full of passion, with very good insights.<br /><br />I'm following his advices, and it's working very well.<br /><br />He explains with his real life examples how to monetize your passion.<br /><br />It's possible, but it's not easy. And requires real will. Real passion.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Miguel, from Brazil
006145785X|4.0|I bought and listened to the Audio CD version of this book.  Simon Jones' articulate and enthusiastic reading was a perfect fit for the insightful and downright impish writing style of MIT Professor Dan Ariely.  Ariely's book introduced me to the world of Behavioral Economics.  His clean, straightforward writing is accessible to the layperson.  The thing that struck me the most was the heavy reliance on experimentation to prove out theories.  The experiments themselves are uniformly inventive and well-executed.  Their hallmark is their simplicity and relevance as well as Professor Ariely's ability to interpret and relate their significance.  I do recommend the Audio version - an enjoyable way to eat up the hours in your car with some downright fascinating stuff.
1423119509|4.0|I'm 25 years old and I've never been so enthralled by a children's series in my life. The books have so much action, you won't be able to put it down. The author's decision to make it a first person narrative was a brillant idea, as you are able to get a feel for Percy's personality and get emotionally involved with what he's going through. Incorporating Greek mythology into the story is a great way to sneak in some history and teach kids. They won't even realize they're learning. Looking forward to the movie as well. I suggest everyone read the books!!!!<br /><br />P.S.- Be careful with Amazon. I've never had a problem with my orders from them, but they sent me the chest and it was all ripped up and severely damaged. But you can't beat the price. You're practically paying for 2 books and receiving 5. So I might just keep the books and get rid of the box. Damn shame, because it's a collectible. Beware. I'm not the only one who this has happened to.
B0026P3G12|4.0|Hearing Susan sing on Britain's Got Talent turned me into an instand fan. What made her performance overwhelming was the purity of her voice and her heartfelt delivery.  This CD does not do her voice justice, the orchestral and piano accompaniment  were overbearing. Her voice is what won the hearts of fans around the world and it should stand alone with softly played background music.
B002T9H2LA|3.0|Good movie, interesting fictional re-write of history, nice concept, GREAT performances, and some very captivating scenes(or chapters) that had you on the edge of your seat.  Having said that, it wasn't what i was expecting.  I thought it was mainly going to be about the 8 guys under Brad Pitt's command, their exploits, and crazy action.  In other words, considering it's a fictional take on events in WW2 and had nazis in it, i thought i was in for another grindhouse-type flick from Tarantino.  Instead, it's a mostly serious film that focuses mainly on Shoshanna's(sp) character and her revenge from chapter 1.<br /><br />So, if you want all-out action flick this isn't it.  But if you want a mostly gripping film that really delivers in most of its scenes, then it's definitely worth a watch no matter what your preconceptions of it may be.  One last thing, i bought the single-disc dvd with the extras: brief ext/alt scenes, \\"Nation's Pride\\" propaganda mini-film, \\"and more\\".  The \\"and more\\" part is just trailers for Inglourious Basterds if you're wondering.  Overall, a rental should do as it's worth a watch.  Be prepared to read a lot of sub-titles though.
B0021L8UQ2|5.0|Wow, it's really hard to say anything about this movie without spoiling the whole point and the surprise. Isabelle Fuhrman as the \\"Orphan\\" gave a fantastic performance, and the whole film is much more mature, and surprising, then you'd expect. No devils or monsters here... it doesn't need one.
0192853619|5.0|I've always loved math, but I've always had difficulties explaining to people why they should care about math.  While this is by no means a complete overview of the basics of the subject since there is far too much to cover, it does provide a lot of meaningful insights as to why Mathematics is interesting.  It's a very pragmatic approach that does away with romanticism while not condensing the material to something overly dense.  This book is a great little book on the wonders of math.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This was a very entertaining movie, unlike the usual boring Startrek fare, this movie was engaging from start to finish. It has great action and some really funny comedic references to past Startrek episodes and characters.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|UP the movie is a great movie to watch. Literally for all ages. I would recommend it to anyone.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Amazon Verified Purchase  Susan Boyle's CD \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" is everything I had hoped for.  Her voice is outstanding and I have listened to the CD many times for my enjoyment.  The personal notes she includes with the album are very touching.  I hope she makes a zillion bucks.  Sue Turner

B001GCUO1Q|5.0|1. I like most have watched the prior 3 Xmen DVDs and this is the best by far.<br /><br />2. Unlike the other films, this film is focused solely on Wolverine and thus the writing / storyline is much more in depth and sophisticated.  In many ways it's akin to Batman Begins.  A definite must see for all Xmen fans.
