1606865617|5.0|This book is a rarity both in writing and story telling.  I read a book a week and have never come across anything like it. It is best described by a USA Today review on the back cover of book because it's EXACTLY how I felt after I read the last page last night:<br /><br />\\"Offers such magic, mystery and sadness that, literally, this reader turned the last page and decided to reread it.  Immediately.  It's that hauntingly wonderful\\".  ~ USA Today<br /><br />True.  I will begin again tonight.
0156034026|4.0|This book reminds me of an Indian movie named \\"Swades\\". I liked the book because I can relate to it on some levels, particularly because I myself have been a Janissary for half a decade now :-). I found his writing very smooth. The narration flows so well from line to line. It was a good read.<br />There are some good thoughts about humanity and contemporary politics. I think Americans will find this to be a very interesting read with the Pakistani culture the author sews into the narration and of course the perspective of a Muslim outsider.

I got my copy for my Kindle.

B004J4WNL2|4.0|I'm not sure how an extrovert would feel about this book but as a dyed-in-the-wool introvert I really appreciate its existence.  Susan Cain mostly follows the Malcom Gladwell template by illustrating points she is making through interviews and anecdotes.  Many authors use this style, some better than others, and Cain falls on the better side of the spectrum.<br /><br /> I am in a leadership role in my job and every time I take one of those personality tests that are so popular in leadership trainings I feel as if I need to apologize, as if I can't be a strong leader and introvert at the same time.  \\"Quiet\\" vindicates introverts everywhere. I appreciated Cain's writing style, her use of research, and the message she was communicating.<br /><br />The early chapters were my favorite.  I enjoyed how Cain described the transition in the United States from a culture that venerated character to one that lionizes personality over everything else.  She uses the rise of Dale Carnegie to illustrate her point.<br /><br />Chapter two discusses that cult of personality today, from Tony Robbins' seminars to Harvard business school.  Cain uses these examples to illustrate how the extroverted personality has been exalted while introverts are disdained or ignored.  Of course this is just the set-up, subsequent chapters discuss such topics as: achievements which are better accomplished by working alone and how sometimes it is necessary to fake extroversion in order to be successful.  Each chapter highlights research on introversion and similar personality traits and then gives examples of people who embody the theme of the chapter.  Some of these featured personalities include Steve Wozniak of Apple Computer fame, Eleanor Roosevelt and Warren Buffet.  The book eventually runs out of steam and it feels as if Cain is stretching to find chapter topics by the end but overall \\"Quiet\\" is a great read!

0307956350|1.0|I only finished this book because I was too stubborn to quit.  Within the first 50 pages I was already asking myself \\"should I waste my time\\" on this book.  The plot jumps around like a butterfly.  The only redeeming quality of this book is that it makes you think about the spouses of Americans who move abroad to work.  It opens the door a little bit on how they feel and what they do with their time while the working spouse is pursuing their interesting job and making lots of money.  The actual story is not so bad but the plot execution with the jump around delivery is terrible.  I like espionage novels and European settings but I did not like this one.  I doubt that I will ever consider reading another book by this author.

0307389839|4.0|This book is a quiet, simple memoir and a brisk read.  It's about writing and running, and their relation to one another through the common themes of discipline, finding one's calling, and the course of life.  I found Murakami's description of his own story very pleasant, too.  (And his writings about Cambridge a bit nostalgic, as I am a Boston native.)  I think the style of this book is probably hit-or-miss.  I definitely recommend it if you're a fan of \\"After Dark\\" or existential novels, but it's not very similar to Murakami's more surreal stuff or more heavy nonfiction.  Probably also worth a shot if you're interested in running or writing.

But beyond that, it is a clever and well written piece of fiction. I literally could not put the book down once I got into the last 100 pages of it. Trust me, you want to read this. In a world of too many vampires, zombies and bondage-loving businessmen this rises above the ordinary. It will make you think, and if you're a child of the 80s(like me) it will almost feel like recapturing a bit of your childhood in the process.

0805095535|5.0|not since the works of thomas wolfe, the north carolina writer, have lists of this magnitude been accumulated by a novelist.  like wolfe, paul auster is obsessed with the individual being situated in time passing within the singular body.  auster tallies his pains experienced through out the sixty-four years of his existence, sexual trysts with prostitutes, one who recites baudelaire, entries of the twenty-one addresses where  he's resided since birth, a repertoire of acts that can be done by the human hand, and everything else that he can recall. in an entry about a locale in france, of which he wrote a book, he informs us, much of what he experienced was omitted, so he rhapsodizes in a three page long sentence, all that he can recall from that time.  if you're thinking of marcel proust, then you're in the right territory, auster is a francophile, having lived several years in france, written a biography on the irishman who wrote in french, samuel beckett,  edited an anthology of french poetry, translated joubert and mallarmé and writes in a style which reminds me of english translations of several of sartre's works, including the philosopher's memoir Words.<br /><br />a journal, written on the east coast, in the borough of brooklyn, ny, in the winter of 2010-2011, the season those of us living on the east coast then, wondered if the snow would ever end, as we woke, expecting almost daily, a new snowfall--as good as any time to write a journal, snowbound, urban cabin fever, approaching sixty-four.<br /><br />writers tend to be squirrelly with their journals, preferring to let the novels, the essays, the memoirs, speak for them, unless journal writing is the preferred literary form.  even then it's a risky undertaking; among the published, few journals attract interest--Speak Memory by nabokov of course, though too stylized to be called a journal, the journals of andre gide are more respected than read, and i know of no one, other than renata adler, who has read any of  samuel pepys' diary.<br /><br />paul auster is a living author with a collection of likable books in most of the usual forms, the novel, the essay, the poem, and the biography. but i don't believe the scholars are yet after his marginalia and ephemera, as with hemingway or henry james.  maybe his fans have been waiting to read what he's been jotting down about his accidents and incidentals in raw form.<br /><br />well here it is.  at some point this book was intended and submitted for publication, subjected to the care of writer and editorial staffs, so it's not too raw.  actually, it's very finished.  his voice is second person, he addresses himself, instead of as the grammatically expected `I', as `You' a pronoun that does not manage to avoid his post-modern musing--satisfying our inner teacher plea for credibility, he shares a fragment of poetry by keats in which the poet refers to himself in the second person, and he recalls those narrators of tough guy hardboiled novels who followed leads and solved cases in the second person.<br /><br />half way through his journal he writes of the death of his mother and reconstructs what he can of her life, including his panic attacks for which he finds an analogy in a ten page synopsis of the 1950 film, D.O.A. (a remake of the film starring dennis quaid and meg ryan appeared in 1988).<br /><br />at sixty-three and sixty-four, mortality is much on his mind, the kinds of death, death by lightning, death by murder, death by accidents in the home, death by war, `absurd and nonsensical' deaths--the french writer, camus, another journal writer, wrote of absurdity and death.<br /><br />at sixty-three and sixty-four, the question is not what can one hold on to faced with the knowledge of the coming of death, but what has one held on to, and on goes auster's `catalogue of sensory data', of his impressions and the connections to events, activities, objects, and persons, a coda of anecdotes, each one inspired by the previous piece, a veritable scheme of variations on a theme: memory.<br /><br />how he met his wife, siri hustvedt, intellectual and author, her books are more at home among the academies of france and germany, than here in the usa, his remarks about her read like information for a curriculum vitae.  writing of her family and their roots and life style and their traditional christmas dinner reminds him of the food he's consumed during a lifetime, which he approaches with the exuberance of the hungry henry miller in paris.<br /><br />journals are a personal undertaking.  paul auster has allowed us to read his.  you might say, he insists.  what more is expected of us, what more can we do, but to  read it and thank him.<br /><br />a rating between 4 and 5 stars.

B0009AM5I6|5.0|This is the recording that turned Angela Gheorghiu into a star virtually overnight and successfully launched her career. It captured the debut performance of La Traviata, not only of the young singer, but also that of the veteran conductor Georg Solti.<br /><br />Combined with a totally traditional production of the opera by Richard Eyre, sumptuous costumes and sets and a fine recording by the experienced Decca team, this 1994 presentation has long been a benchmark recording and one that is still hard to match, let alone beat.<br /><br />One could enlarge upon additional features that add to the merits of this recording. Certainly one should mention the quality of the supporting lead roles. Those of Lopardo as Alfredo and Nucci as his father are outstanding with strong characterisation, sure technique and firm voices. The remaining supporting roles are all done very well indeed and the whole opera is conveyed with tremendous dramatic sweep and certainty progressing remorselessly from light to dark.<br /><br />Not least of all, the production is believable because everyone is of the right age for their parts. This is by no means always true of operas in general, a feature which can crucially undermine the vital `suspension of disbelief' so necessary in all drama.<br /><br />The recording still remains acceptable within the context of its date. The DTS is good re-processed stereo. The image is 4:3 rather than widescreen. The use of spotlighting in the production, especially in the increasingly dark settings in the second half of the opera, can create harsh lighting and burn-out on light details such as light coloured clothing. This is most apparent on long shots which also lack the sharp definition of today's HD cameras. It is best, therefore, to consider this nowadays as an historic recording in terms of technology. This allows for a great deal more latitude than that which would apply to a new recording.<br /><br />So as an historic issue this remains justifiably famous because of all its unique and special qualities which conspire to make this a truly memorable occasion. The recording is fully up to the task on those terms. So on those terms again, I am sure that most people would be happy with a 5 star rating for this very special event.<br /><br />........................................<br /><br />Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:<br /><br />Ian, Ian:<br />Your Reviews are becoming incrementally Better and Better, and this could well be your best ever!<br />Frankly, I find it an Intellectual and Musical delight to read them, even if I have no intention of ever buying another DVD, or 4:3 Aspect Ratio Production.<br />Thank you.

B006UM051Q|4.0|Prequel: Dear reader,<br />Please note that this review has been posted by Amazon in two places - the correct place featuring the singers as in the review and the wrong place under a performance including Domingo. Please show a little understanding of this problem that is beyond reviewers' control. At the very least, by having by mistake, two reviews of two very different versions to read, it might prove to be worth reading both anyway. Best wishes, Ian Giles<br /><br />...........................................<br />The version starring Elmira Vida now continues!<br /><br />Madama Butterfly was Puccini's own favourite opera and is a firm favourite with audiences worldwide. This popularity has created strong views and there are as many opinions held about this opera as there are enthusiasts! The following description therefore is simply intended to be more of a guide to aid personal choice rather than a review leading to a firm conclusion.<br /><br />In this performance, there is a particularly fine balance maintained between the two contrasting characters of Pinkerton and Butterfly which enables them to establish a believable relationship in Act 1. Later in the opera, in Act 3, the impact of Pinkerton's actions seem to finally strike home which enhances the dramatic impact of the opera's conclusion.<br /><br />In this performance Butterfly (Elmira Vida) portrays her unswerving devotion to both Pinkerton (Carlo Barricelli) and her child totally convincingly. In this she is helped by the show-stealing part played by the little boy who is both wonderful in his role and about the right age - I guess 3 years as it should be. Butterfly is not 15-18 years old as in the story of course, but in this performance she is still able to make it credible that Pinkerton would be smitten by her charms. The roles of Butterfly and Pinkerton are both convincingly acted as well as well sung.<br /><br />The supporting roles of Suzuki (Annamaria Popescu) and Sharpless (Luca Salsi) are also equally well portrayed and believable with good communication and acting constantly maintained. The remaining solo parts and chorus are all completely satisfactory.<br /><br />The outdoor set is simple but totally effective. This is a revolving stage showing interior and exterior sides of a Japanese style house with use made of the sliding and translucent panels. These panels enable telling use to be made of shadowy figures such as the arriving and fleeing relatives. Most tellingly it enables an unbending and uncommunicative Kate (Sally Wilson) to be shown in silhouette in contrast to the compliant Suzuki. This totally unyielding posture is maintained to the very end of her part and it makes one fear for the future life of the child in her care.<br /><br />All the parts are well sung and acted with sustained communication with the intended exception of Kate as above. The outdoor nature of the event is overcome by the use of radio mikes which enable every word to be heard clearly. The translation of the subtitles in English is good and there are detailed booklet descriptions. The camera work is revealing without being invasive and the colours are rendered richly. The sound is presented in DTS-HD, Dolby Digital and stereo and is of good quality.<br /><br />In summary therefore, the elements of communication and allied acting in this performance and production combine to achieve a dramatically strong and believable presentation. It is unlikely that it will be considered definitive by many but nevertheless, in my opinion, it would be unreasonable to rate it as worth less than 4 stars. It should be able to give many purchasers plenty of satisfaction while still leaving plenty of scope for alternative versions to be appreciated.lso equally well portrayed and believable with good communication and acting constantly maintained.

B006CAXPSQ|5.0|Prequel: Amazon has correctly listed this review of Gades Carmen (flamenco dance drama) under Gades but also wrongly under Bizet's Carmen with Alagna.<br />Unfortunately this sort of double listing is quite common as Amazon's listing software seems to get confused by similar titles.<br />Reviewers are unable to do anything about this so please be patient and scroll to the performance that you are interested in.<br />Thanks, Ian Giles.<br /><br />.................................................<br />Carmen flamenco styled dance drama by Gades review<br /><br />This is probably a good place to start investigating the work of Gades as it is such a well-known plot and well told by Bizet in his opera. However this example of the flamenco art combined with more traditional ballet skills as envisioned by Gades is able to extend the rawness of the emotional impact to an almost frightening degree.<br /><br />Some background explaining how this fusion of ballet and flamenco came about may be of help at this stage: Gades, as a young man, studied classical dance as well as all the Spanish popular dance idioms. This dual interest and skill enabled him, uniquely, to fuse together the two art forms of ballet and flamenco. He believed that flamenco must also be shorn of all extraneous distractions in order to bring the essence of the dance to light. At this early stage he was also providing the choreography for classical ballet such as Bolero, Carmen and El Amor Brujo for companies such as La Scala. From 1981 he formed the collaboration with Carlos Saura, the film director, which resulted in some of his flamenco-based creations being filmed. These films had an enormous effect on ballet companies around the world and Gades became very influential in this way while continuing as a ballet dancer in Giselle for example.<br /><br />This production brings the 1983 Carmen to our screens in an amazingly effective performance. The music includes specially pre-recorded Bizet extracts played by the Suisse Romande orchestra with considerable brio. The majority of the music however is pure flamenco - two guitars, solo singers and clapping. Precision ensemble dance to massed multi-rhythmic clapping has to be seen to be believed! The scenarios presented crackle with sexual tensions and competitiveness and an unmistakable underlying and ever-present threat of violence. This is not just between men but also between women and between the sexes. This is an artistic statement beyond any of my previous experiences and I found it gripping. This is not the same as comforting. There is not a moment of tenderness to be seen - not even in the highly disciplined acknowledgement of the final applause.<br /><br />It is likely that non-specialists of this art form will fail to pick up or begin to understand many of the underlying meanings in all of this - subtitles would have been invaluable in the frequent sung parts, but this is not a good reason to deny this full acknowledgement. The recording is all that could be wished for and there is a bonus in the form of interviews with members of the team. The sleeve notes are particularly informative. This issue delivers an unforgettable experience and essential guide to a dramatic art form.le brio. The majority of the music however is pure flamenco - two guitars, solo singers and clapping.

They refer to each other as Mr. Cross or Miss. Tramell. No young couple actually does that, even to be sexy...it's weird.<br />2. Gideon has his ex-fiance lingering around who still loves him and is drop dead gorgeous. Christian Grey had Elena (\\"Mrs. Robinson\\")<br />3. Probably the most obvious point, Gideon is young, hot and super rich. He's charitable on top of owning various clubs, gyms, hotels, etc.<br />4. Eva has a fiesty & beautiful best friend - Cary. Ana had Kate.<br />The list goes on...<br /><br />But the thing that really left me annoyed after reading this book was the way the author left out so much about Gideon's past JUST to keep you reading the sequels. After Gideon attacked Eva in the middle of the night there should have been something said about his past explaining why he has such violent, sexual nightmares. Instead, they just tip toed around the fact that his family's house was not a safe place for him, anal freaked him out, etc. but never actually explained his actions. The end of the book, which would have made sense for him to reveal SOMETHING, only added more complications to their relationship by introducing his ex-fiance. Didn't see why it was necessary to introduce her and it only made him look like a secretive bastard by omitting telling Eva he talks to her everyday. WTF?!
B007FH9GA6|1.0|The story is solid. Do not expect a normal movie, this movies should be rated XXX for violence and graphic torture. We only watch a man get suffocated, a guy get tortured with a can and a girl get raped while being handcuffed, gagged and blindfolded. A sweet movie.
B00633W614|5.0|This is the second book of at least a trilogy, possibly more, about the English Clifton family's adventures beginning in 1920, and in this book going through the second world war. The book, like almost all other Archer books is extremely engrossing and fleshes out the large list of characters very well. The biggest fault is that it is a continuation of the first book in the series \\"Only Time Will Tell\\". The reader will not be able to follow the nuances of the events and reactions without having read the first book. This said, those that read the first book have most assuredly been awaiting the second one and experienced the same pull to read it at one sitting.<br /><br />Harry Clifton, introduced in book one continues his adventures in resolving an issue preventing his marriage to Emma Barrington. These issues were delineated in book one and continue to prevent the union of the two characters. In the course of resolving the problem Harry joins the British Merchant Marine, has his ship sunk, lands in the U.S and via his use of a false identity lands in prison there. Other characters in both books do require reading of the first one in order to continue to understand them. The events are riveting and keep the reader mesmerized by the story. Without the knowledge it is still a good read and some allusions to book one will help, but Sins of the Father is really the next chapter in this series. All in all with Archer's writing skills it is worth while to pick up the first book, read it and than continue with the series.
1475143389|5.0|This book is excellent for beginners but even more so for intermediates who have lost focus or have failed to see progress.<br />I myself have been training for years with only slight muscle mass gains. This book has painted a very clear picture as to why I have been unsuccessful with my training and why I haven't achieved my weightlifting goals. More importantly, however, it has provided me with the knowledge to personally structure my nutrition plan and workouts to make progress. The book is very easy to follow and the best part is the live support that comes with the book. I e-mailed the author and received a response within 40 minutes!!!!!! Not only has he personally answered my questions but he demonstrates a genuine interest in helping his readers transform their bodies.
0802473156|4.0|As of the time I am writing this review 368 out of 398 reviewers gave this book a 4 or 5 star rating - that's 92% \\"I liked it\\" and \\"I loved it\\" ratings. With these many positive reviews there are some critical reviews as well that are worth reading to get a balanced overall review - there may actually be more (and likely are more) than 5 love languages or categories.  The author has a significant amount of knowledge and experience regarding married couples and it is certainly worth considering his input.  What will make the information in this book the most beneficial is incorporating it with personal experience, and this subject will likely be a \\"work in progress\\" project with a focus on getting better everyday to result in a lasting, happy, and fulfilling marital arrangement.<br /><br />My favorite review is \\"Learning to Speak, December 23, 2010\\" where the reviewer's review could have been a superb foreword for this book.  May I suggest reading it as in my opinion it is brief, clear, and simple.  If you have time consider reading the other reviews and comments too.<br /><br />Of course, some may not agree or totally agree with this book's author; however, the subject of marriage is simple, yet complexed - and even compounding at times.<br /><br />In my opinion this is one of the better books on this subject.  There is some good material here making it worth considering reading it.<br /><br />This book did stimulate my thinking on the different viewpoints in marriage and if  you'd like to read my comments on this marriage subject contine, if not please feel free to move on.  I am just hoping that some of these thoughts may help some considering marriage or who are already married.<br /><br />Some believe that men and women basically use different parts of their brains. Often heard are: \\"The left brain thinks, the right brain feels.\\" \\"The left brain analyzes, the right brain intuits.\\" \\"The left brain is logical, the right brain is emotional.\\" Likely, our thinking, feeling, and loving are more complex than these simple statements; yet, at least on occasion (likely more often) men and women think and feel differently and express themselves differently - the author of this book identifies, categorizes, and classifies love into five languages. I would add one additional language, which is the ability to sincerely and promptly say \\"I'm sorry\\" from one's heart. From my 45+ years of marriage and from what I have learned from many others, a successful, lasting, and happy marriage involves two great forgivers and apologizers. In my three and a half decades of managing people I have found that those who never or almost never say \\"I'm sorry\\" have difficulties with their working and personal relationships.<br /><br />A husband and a wife differ to varying degrees about how they both think and feel about things, and this is in harmony with how the Creator said regarding Adam that He was going to make a helper for him, as a complement of him (not an identical twin of him - she was made different in a good way). A complement completes, perhaps making something just right. A husband and wife will benefit from loving each other, especially as the other person wants and needs to be loved.<br /><br />Couple this with deep respect and you hold the two keys to a successful, lasting, and happy marriage and family life - Love and Respect.<br /><br />Hopefully adding this thought will help your loving and respectful marriage grow more each and every day: \\"I love you more today than yesterday, but only half as much as tomorrow.\\"<br /><br />And one additional thought: \\"It is more beneficial for me to be respectful and loving in all that I do, than for me to be loved (something I very much want).\\"<br /><br />Every marriage has the potential to be successful, lasting, and happy, especially using the two keys of \\"Love\\" and \\"Respect.\\" Your marriage can be a most precious, valuable, and wonderful gift by using these two keys with sincerity and heartfelt caring; and, never let pride, the childish silent treatment, or other unloving disrespectful traits mar your treasured marriage!<br /><br />A good \\"PRIDE\\" antidote expressed before the end of the day: \\"I'm sorry - I was mistaken - How can I make it up to you? - I'll do my best to be better - Will you please forgive me?\\"<br /><br />A good \\"CHILDISH SILENT TREATMENT\\" antidote as soon as possible: Rescue the loving, caring, and respect adult within you. \\"Whining\\" and \\"I won't talk to you\\" are childish - they rarely worked in childhood and have no place among true adults. \\"Scolding\\" and \\"Lecturing\\" is easily blocked out. The best communications are loving, caring, and respectful adult expressions coupled with a big dose of attentive listening and understanding.<br /><br />In ballroom dancing it has been said that \\"it takes two to tango,\\" and \\"it takes one to lead.\\" Many have found a successful, permanent, and happy marriage includes three - the loving husband, the respectful wife, and the Creator and Author of marriage (who perfectly knows what's best).<br /><br />A good question to ask yourself at the beginning of each day: \\"What will I do today that shows I both love and respect my spouse?\\" TIP: While certainly one positive act or action daily is a good start, many are even better and will bring more benefits.<br /><br />ADDITIONAL BENEFICIAL READING: \\"One Minute for Myself [Yourself]: How to Manage Your Most Valuable Asset\\" by Spencer Johnson, MD - while it is good to have a great relationship with your spouse; it is essential to have a good relationship with yourself, especially if your goal is to love your neighbor as yourself. Keep in mind if this is one of your goals that your closest neighbor is your spouse. Good relationships with ourselves and others I believe is what our true success in life is all about. My thought is that one needs a good relationship with oneself first in order to have good relationships with others - and it is wise to pursue \\"self-respect\\" by being respectful of yourself and all others. I like the thought of \\"self-respect\\" rather than \\"self-esteem\\" because it is easily possible to think too much of oneself; better to just focus on being respectful, caring, loving, and having proper self-respect.<br /><br />ADDENDUM:  One of best ways to tell your spouse \\"I Love You\\" is to say \\"I love you just the way you are.\\"  The principle here is if you want to be accepted in any relationship you should give your acceptance first.  How many of us really want someone to relentlessly badger us to change this or change that about ourselves.  Change in itself can be difficult, but that is another subject to consider.

B006KX3GXO|4.0|I have PicsArt on my KindleFire. I'd read reviews saying it wouldn't work, but gave it a chance anyway, and I haven't had any problems at all. The app has a lot of editing options, unlike Instagram which everyone seems to be using nowadays. The only reason I won't rate it a 5 is because the Artistic group of edits can take a lot of time to load, which makes it difficult to advancely edit those modes to your desired specifications. However, other than that, this app is great for photo editing aand collages. I'm greatly pleased to find a free app that does so much without slowing down on my kindle like a browser editing site would.<br />However, since the recent app upgrade, it's gotten a couple bugs. Easily remedied, but disappointed that an \\"upgrade\\" would really be a downgrade.
B007Y1ARLA|2.0|I was hoping for more. It's not as good as the first three. There are a few songs that are \\"good,\\" or at least are approaching that level, but as one reviewer noted, a lot of it seems forced. The lyrics are also a little sappy and contrived. Decent for background music but not something I'd choose to listen to on a regular basis - especially if I'm paying attention to the words.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an excellent way to study the Bible.  There are several versions that will enable one to read a verse or chapter in a different way to perhaps learn the message more easily.  It is quick to find a chapter or verse number in the index and with just a touch.....it is opened.  Some versions have an oral option in addition to the written.  Most have a built in dictionary and highlight and notes available.  Last but not the least...one only has to carry a small e machine instead of several large Bibles and all the other things.
B001OBT3FC|5.0|This memorial concert has such close links with Karajan that it is worthwhile explaining why it meant so much to both Ozawa and Mutter. The connection between both of them and between themselves and Karajan is that they were both Karajan's prot&eacute;g&eacute;es and had been considerably supported by Karajan in establishing their respective careers. They therefore make an especially appropriate pair of artistes to fulfil their roles in this concert.<br /><br />The bonus feature is in the form of a post-concert interview with both Mutter and Ozawa separately in which they are asked what effect Karajan had on their lives and also why they had chosen their particular pieces to play/conduct.<br /><br />In the case of Anne-Sophie Mutter she made very clear her admiration for Karajan outlining his many special contributions to music and to music making. In particular she emphasised his abilities to work tirelessly with the orchestra, up to 50 hours for a single piece, to achieve such a level of understanding that the orchestral members were then free to express themselves within the concept being worked on.<br /><br />Ozawa stressed the contribution that Karajan had made to the advance of recording techniques which we all benefit from today. His choice of the Tchaikovsky was made because of the enormous identification he felt with Karajan's interpretation. Likewise with Mutter, who explained that she had played the Beethoven with Karajan more often than any other piece. Her encore was her audition piece with Karajan when she was only 13 years of age.<br /><br />The concert recorded on this disc fully fulfilled these retrospective comments. The Beethoven was given a steady but spellbinding interpretation progressing from darkness into light as Mutter explains. This, not surprisingly, was met with a prolonged ovation which was then followed by a simply sublime performance of the Bach Sarabande from the 2nd Partita. This is not a performance in the 'authentic' manner but is altogether more generous in its expression of romantic warmth. This is achieved without heaviness although it could never be accused of being speedy. In my opinion this is a performance that Karajan would have identified with and approved of.<br /><br />`Tonight this orchestra played amazingly' said Ozawa when concluding his interview held just after the concert. Both artists stressed Karajan's modesty and warmth - important recollections frequently unspoken of and therefore largely unknown.<br /><br />Ozawa was on inspirational form and his above acknowledgement of the orchestra's contribution modestly fails to fully explain why. From this viewers point of view I would suggest that they were inspired, not only by the debt that they felt towards Karajan in this series of concerts, but also by Ozawa's deeply committed, exciting and ultimately moving interpretation. Once more this is a performance that would have earned praise from Karajan himself being meticulously prepared with a strong sense of direction leading to a satisfying emotional conclusion.<br /><br />This is a remarkable memorial tribute to Karajan's 100th birthday and is given a superb recording to match with crisp, detailed and non-invasive camera work coupled with excellent sound in stereo and surround format presented in PCM 5.1 format. In my opinion this is outstanding throughout and worth every one of 5 stars.more generous in its expression of romantic warmth.

B0043H9VTM|5.0|If there was ever a such a thing as an atheist saint, Hypatia would be it.  This movie is a dramatization of historical events. The city of Alexandria was a center for learning. It was said that the philosophical and religious discourse among the merchants and general population in the agora were on a very educated level, that which rivaled the scholars. With the onset of Christianity, the religious discussion changed. Religion was primarily based upon cosmic myths, most of which had lost their original meaning due to the Pythagorean concepts which fused with the old religion creating multiple paradoxes as to generate such debate. Is God anthropomorphic or is God light?<br /><br />Hypatia was a scientist and philosopher, she is portrayed as an atheist in this film, although her religious belief is uncertain. She may very well had been a pagan. The menstrual cloth she presented to a would-be suitor is recorded in history. The movie is long and at times doesn't move along fast enough.  I thought it needed better editing.<br /><br />Apart from the dramatization, the movie sticks to history. The documentary commentary writing on the screen is white on a predominately white background which made it difficult for me to read with old eyes and an analog TV. I had to pause it.<br /><br />In spite of some of the films shortcomings, I absolutely loved it.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|As fans of Edgar Rice Burroughs, we looked forward to the release of John Carter with excitement and apprehension.  Would the film successfully translate Barsoom to the big screen?  We weren't able to catch the film in theatres until later in its run, but we were so glad we did!<br /><br />This was the first film I've seen where the CGI doesn't distract the moviegoer from the film.  We were enthralled with the movie, not once breaking out of our spell to say to ourselves, \\"yeah, that was CGI.\\" We were able just to enjoy the film.<br /><br />There are powerful moments in the film, with very effective direction/editing.  The actors all performed well.  We had no complaints.<br /><br />We could not wait to pick up the film on DVD.  We loved it so much that we bought the four-disc set, despite our not owning a Blu-Ray player, in anticipation of some day enjoying the other discs in the set.  We shared the movie with our children, who are in various stages of reading the books.  All were equally blown away by the movie; to them, it compares to other not-named-here sci-fi epics we've shared with them in the past.

140053271X|4.0|I received my first nook almost a year ago. Right out of the box the power button jiggled back and forth and it very rarely turned on and off for me via the button. Then 2 months in my Nook stopped responding to me. It was just frozen on the screensaver and no matter whether I plugged it into the computer or the wall, it didn't respond. I called the company and was told to bring it into my nearest story (which is about an hour and half away). She got it to charge and boot up for me saying that the battery was dead even though I had fully charged it the previous day. FFWD 9 months and my nook still kept freezing. It would freeze while reading a book, or browsing the B&N store or wouldn't load up from the screen saver. The only way to reboot it was to plug it into the wall and it would reboot. My final straw was when I could no longer unplug my Nook due to it freezing. The second I unplugged it, it would freeze on me and I'd have to repeat the process of plugging it in and waiting for it to start up for me. I called the company, they arranged for me to pick up a new Nook at the closest store and I drove down to get my new Nook. Apparently, as you might have guessed, my Nook had a faulty battery. There was no hassle returning the Nook and the guy even let me test drive the new one before walking out of the store to make sure I was happy with it. The first thing I noticed besides the fact that it didn't immediately freeze up on me was the fact that the power button was secure and didn't jiggle at all.<br /><br />So since I've gone through two separate Nooks, the latest showing minimal signs of problem, I'd say this is a decent product. Maybe I just happened to get the lemon of the lot? I still enjoy reading from my nook. It's a light weight device and small enough that it fits in my purse with ease. The e-ink screen makes it easier to read for extended periods of time without having to take a break due to a headache. The long life battery (when not a dud) lasts long enough for my 20 hr flight and a week without needing to be charged or turned off. Since I've gotten the replacement Nook a month ago, I've only needed to plug it in once. I also like that when I take it outside to read, there is no glare on the screen. It really is as if you are reading a book, except less bulky. I like being able to highlight and make notes in the book, it makes going back for references much easier. With a book, I would take a strip of paper and put it between the two pages, to later go back and reread them to figure out why I put the paper there. Even though I had a less than ideal experience with being a Nook owner I do enjoy the device. I always carry my Nook with me everywhere I go.ugh for my 20 hr flight and a week without needing to be charged or turned off.

B003OK2GX2|4.0|I came into this show expecting there to be elements of Doctor Who, and there are, which is great, but it also doesn't just limit itself to a family audience, it goes into more adult themes, which is something that is definitely interesting. This second episode sealed the deal for me on watching the rest of the series on Amazon Prime, it's definitely worth your time if you enjoy Doctor Who and want something a little more adult. The beginning sequence says \\"The 21st century is where it all changes\\" and it doesn't lie, taking place in the 21st century you better believe that we're becoming more accustomed to the thought that sex does, in fact, exist, and it sometimes happens out of marriage!(GASP!SHOCK!) When the hard rule for most is  \\"3 dates means sex\\" I have no qualm with a show diving a little bit into our obsession with the subject to make us question how much we really need that hit. That's exactly what this episode does if you look at it beyond the sex that is used on-screen. I'm excited to see where the show goes from these first two episodes.

034580404X|4.0|Fifty Shades of Grey-The Trilogy<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed make up the trilogy written by E L James.  At this point, the reviews are numerous, merciless, angry and seductive.  I had planned to write a review based on the storyline, but I think I shall divert down a different path.  But I must say that without a doubt, the media hype and categorization of the trilogy as `mommy porn' is what brought these books to the forefront of reader curiosity and at the time, I hadn't thought about reading any or all of the books.  But a couple of emails from a marketing director, and an agent (requesting my thoughts) brought me up short. Maybe I should read the books and see what all the fuss is about? So $30 and 3 nights later, I had completed the trilogy and now I offer my opinion-because yes-everything I have read about the series is strictly an opinion based on personal views. Descriptions from erotica, erotic romance, soft to hard core porn and BDSM have been used to categorize the genre, but in my opinion, the truth may very well lie somewhere in between or in a combination of descriptive titles and subjects.<br /><br />Many reviewers opposed to the storyline content have attacked the quality of the writing comparing it to fan fiction and drivel.  I will not address quality, as many other books I have read and reviewed, have been of a much poorer quality than this particular series, and yet the storylines have been interesting.<br /><br />Erotic Adult Fiction:  Erotic adult fiction is now a female driven genre both as a reader and an author.  Once the domain of me, women writer's usually under author pseudonyms or initials only are pushing the envelope of erotic fiction.  Once considered written porn, the genre of erotic fiction is fast becoming main-stream adult literature.<br /><br />Why the rise in popularity?  Several reasons.<br /><br />The popularity has increased with the advent of ebooks.  The anonymity for the reader, hidden behind the electronic age of virtual books, allows for anyone to purchase a book, without the fear of retribution, side-long glances from the 18 year old store clerk or 60 year old librarian, and instant gratification (so to speak) for availability. Similar to the days of Playboy and Hustler wrapped in brown paper on the upper shelves in the magazine section at the local corner store.  Women and men no longer have to fear being judged by a stranger for their choices in reading material.<br /><br />Society's Moral Values<br /><br />Over the years, society has eased up on what they perceive to be a `more'.  What was once considered `deviant' are quite diverse and can range from murder to rape, too fat to too thin, etiquette faux pas, and fetishes to perversions. Fetishes are usually harmless-an odd attraction -voyeurism  e.g..  Many people believe as long as no one is hurt or being forced, and everyone is over 18, who are we to judge. But there is always the fine line.<br /><br />But if a fetish escalates into perversions or something illegal e.g. whereby voyeurism leads to sexual assault, rape or murder, then society has laws and treatments for people with this kind of deviant behavior. Once thought as deviant behavior, especially for women.....reading erotic literature was  considered immoral and in some cases, a sin (for those who follow religious dictates)....they  would have hidden an erotic novel, tucked the book away in a sock drawer. But many of society's mores have become the norm. What was once unacceptable as reading material, is now a main stream best seller.<br /><br />Many erotic storylines involve explicit sexual descriptive narration.  The language is graphic and there is virtually nothing off limits except children and familial relations.  Many women are now reading novels or series of novels featuring homosexual storylines.  And of course, many of today's erotic fantasy novels involve MMF storylines-with multiple partners at one time.  Again...fantasy is the operative word. Some of the Harlequin Romance novels are considered tame with their `suggestive or implied' sex as compared to most of the romantic/erotic adult storylines released today.<br /><br />Television and the film industry have long had a rating system for what is perceived as appropriate for different age groups.  Now the `rating system' has been applied to many of the different books and novels, due to the `graphic nature' of the content.  And saying that....the ebook revolution does not discriminate against the virtual shopper.  Identification is not required when ordering a book online from most of the websites.....all that is required is a valid charge card and an email address (for ebooks)<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy<br /><br />Yes, there is some BDSM (BDSM is a term that stands for such patterns in sexual behavior as Bondage and Discipline, Domination and Submission, Sadism and Masochism. -bdsmguide.org).  Like everything in life, there are degrees and valuations, and varying shades of grey (pun intended).  Like a sliding color wheel, the BDSM content is revealed in shades and degrees. But the author never crosses the imaginary `hard-line' into true hard-core savagery.  The `heroine' is never forced or coerced, she is aware at all times and enters into the relationship wholly aware. The storyline Dom/Sub relationship is never carried over into a public social context and the practice is always safe and consensual.  Yes, there are times when a soft-line is pushed, but it is addressed throughout the story.<br /><br />Now to backtrack slightly-this series is NOT about BDSM. This story is about addressing the truth, acknowledging responsibility, the loss of power and control, and the fight to gain it all back.  This story is also about finding love, losing and  making steps towards recovery. The BDSM content is minimal, but has apparently caught the interest of the public, as does anything that goes against the `norm'.  The practice of BDSM is wide ranging and is often misinterpreted by the lay-people not involved in the practice.  BDSM has been labeled everything from a fetish to a perversion, but when the people involved are consenting adults, wholly aware of the circumstances and the situation, the behavior or role-playing is acted out according to a specific script of behaviors and actions. There are rules, agreements, safety words, consequences and varying degrees of pleasure (all safe and legal)-to which a question must be addressed-Who are we to judge a lifestyle that is different from our own?<br /><br />The Fifty Shades series is about a man with demons buried so deep he turns to BDSM for control.  But the underlying current of BDSM becomes blurred when the title character of Christian Grey, at 15years old, becomes the submissive to a woman several years older.  As a sexual predator, the woman holds power and control of the teenage boy, shaping him into the man who would one day run a billion dollar enterprise.  And it is this relationship that directs and controls all of his future endeavors and needs.  Even in the world of high finance and business, power and control is the ultimate aim.<br /><br />The series is written from the `heroine's' point of view.  We are privy to Anastasia Steele's intimate thoughts and ideas, as well as her fears and worries about the man she has fallen in love (with). And she is NOT without some power of her own.  As the story progresses, the lines of control slowly blur, until it is Ana who has the ultimate control - of a man's heart and his soul.<br /><br />see all of my reviews at : thereadingcafe.comin...fantasy is the operative word.

Yes, there are times when a soft-line is pushed, but it is addressed throughout the story.<br /><br />Now to backtrack slightly-this series is NOT about BDSM. This story is about addressing the truth, acknowledging responsibility, the loss of power and control, and the fight to gain it all back.  This story is also about finding love, losing and  making steps towards recovery. The BDSM content is minimal, but has apparently caught the interest of the public, as does anything that goes against the `norm'.  The practice of BDSM is wide ranging and is often misinterpreted by the lay-people not involved in the practice.  BDSM has been labeled everything from a fetish to a perversion, but when the people involved are consenting adults, wholly aware of the circumstances and the situation, the behavior or role-playing is acted out according to a specific script of behaviors and actions. There are rules, agreements, safety words, consequences and varying degrees of pleasure (all safe and legal)-to which a question must be addressed-Who are we to judge a lifestyle that is different from our own?<br /><br />The Fifty Shades series is about a man with demons buried so deep he turns to BDSM for control.  But the underlying current of BDSM becomes blurred when the title character of Christian Grey, at 15years old, becomes the submissive to a woman several years older.  As a sexual predator, the woman holds power and control of the teenage boy, shaping him into the man who would one day run a billion dollar enterprise.  And it is this relationship that directs and controls all of his future endeavors and needs.  Even in the world of high finance and business, power and control is the ultimate aim.<br /><br />The series is written from the `heroine's' point of view.  We are privy to Anastasia Steele's intimate thoughts and ideas, as well as her fears and worries about the man she has fallen in love (with). And she is NOT without some power of her own.  As the story progresses, the lines of control slowly blur, until it is Ana who has the ultimate control - of a man's heart and his soul.<br /><br />see all of my reviews at : thereadingcafe.com
0345803507|5.0|This was the last of a three book series. Had to wait a little longer than I'd hoped for the book to arrive and now I'm just sad that I already finished it. Anticipating more from this author, best books I've read in years.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is asome. I love it. please.  make another. one it is cool fun asome I love it a lot
B006RUJST6|5.0|I truely do not understand how anyone could give this less than a five star review. This book made me feel soooo many emotions and feelings. Laughter, excitement, heartbreak, and hope were many of the ones I had experience. It made me cry or tear up more than once. Most amazing book I have read, nothing like the predictible books I have been reading.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i enjoyed the game it is a very fun game to pass time but also hard at the same time.
0307951529|4.0|Full disclosure:  I received a gift copy of this book from the author and as a follower of his blog, I was super excited for this book to finally be released.  Chris inspires me because he is truly living life on his terms.  This book provides a road map of how to live on your own terms if that's what you want, too.  Make no mistake, all the examples and stories in the book are not meant to provide you with turn-key solutions.  You will already need some skills in some area (not necessarily book-learnin' skills, but any kind of skill) that people will pay for.  He tells you how to discern between two paths before striking out on your own: how you can tell if your passion will pay the bills, and how you can tell if it won't.  That's worth knowing, especially nowadays when it's all too common to drive by empty storefronts of businesses that were built on passion and enthusiasm, but had no one willing to buy from them.  What I like about the book is that there are a ton of examples of people from all walks of life and all kinds of financial backgrounds who were successful in striking out on their own.  There really are examples of attainable dreams in this tome.  Not all the examples will apply to you, and some actually sound more expensive to start than the title would have you believe, but I feel that the author probably interviewed the business owners after they had been comfortably established in their business after several years of building it.  However, don't let that turn you away from the book.  At no point does Guillebeau try to make you believe that success is going to be easy, but he's lowering the bar for entry with the $100 figure, and saying that the rest is up to your own hard work and willingness to persevere.  I like that message.  The message tells you not to be too afraid if you don't have the money to start (pretty encouraging), and gives you a little push and inspiration to turn a small business into one that can comfortably sustain you if you make some good (I didn't say all of them had to be good, sometimes you will fail) decisions along the way.  He provides realistic bounce-back tales of businesses whose lives where threatened after some horrible botch up in their early stages, only to come back again and thrive.  What I like about this book is that it's plenty accessible.  But like another reviewer, I wish it was a little heavier in providing more how-to's than on copious amounts of inspirational examples.  More how-to's would make this the perfect guide for how to get over the inertia of starting your first micro-business.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I've used this to touch up many of my drawings and photos. its great in many ways. it could however use more stickers and a greater of variety of effects. other then that I love it
B00004YTIQ|3.0|As said in a lot of other reviews, the cover is too big.. much bigger than shown in the picture. So, it doesn't fit snugly as it should but I was just looking for something to keep the pool cleaner so I didn't have to change the water quite so often, esp in a pool that hold 132 gallons. So, I am happy with it. It is a lot thinner than I expected too and a light clear-blue so it lets a lot of sunlight in and makes the pool even hotter.. also not a great thing. But like I said, just looking for something to keep the water cleaner and it does a good enough job for me.
0061777269|5.0|This is a serious study of the science of the consciousness.  Anyone interested in the study of Near Death Experiences, intuition, premonition, and all other types of consciousness should read this book.  It is not really a book but a detailed study of all the research surrounding these phenomenon, and Dr. Pim Van Lommel, MD has done his homework.  The book's detail is exhaustive, and the facts, figures, and discussions are very well documents and supported.  Dr. van Lommel may be the world's expert on this type of phenomenon, though he does not make such a claim, it is simply hard to believe anyone else has done such extensive work on this subject.  He has developed a hypothesis of consciousness that is extremely interesting, and compelling, and he supports his theory with scientific analysis and study throughout.  Some of that study is even done by the US Cia, Stanford, and Princeton, and he uses all of it to promote his idea that much of consciousness is 'non-local'.  That essentially means that much of the brain acts as a receiver, along with cellular DNA, and consciousness resides outside of the physical material of the brain.  Information is stored as wave particles in a dimension that is space-less, and timeless, and has the ability to communicate with other intelligent creatures who live in the present, or in the past or perhaps even the future.  This is a compelling book, not a bunch of psychobabble.  This book will change the way to see life and death, and if you are religious, will strengthen your faith in a way you could not have imagined.  I do not know if van Lommel is religious, but one suspects he may have started this study as a typical atheist Dutch doctor, but is a much more spiritual person now.  Get the book, read it, it will take you some place you have not been, and it will take you there on solid ground.
B0086700CM|5.0|pretty cool. I almost rated this a 4 because once I get to 4000 miles it starts getting slow on my kindle fire. so I recommend you to get it. just don't get to mad if ot gets slow. works best on kindle.
B008B3F38C|4.0|Now I knew Delain was releasing a new album, and had been for months. But I also knew that it would be a while because of them getting purchased by a new record company or something like that. So I stopped following the album's release.<br /><br />Well on the third of this month, I was driving with my friend and listening to April Rain, and mentioned to him that they were releasing a new album soon. But that I had no idea when.<br /><br />Well imagine my surprise when I looked them up the very next day only to see this album had released the exact day I said that too my friend.<br /><br />Well, this album is amazing. I don't know how, but they managed to surpass their debut album. Its that good. I wont get into the songs since everyone else has, but this album is amazing. Its right up there with their debut album and somehow much much better, and leagues aove their mediocre second album.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Delain or music of this genre, purchase immediately.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best Bible app I've found. Many different versions if that's your thing, you can make notes, and bookmarks verses too. Nice and easy to use too. The only thing I don't like is that youbmust be connected to the web use certain things, and some of my bookmarks haven't transferred to my phone. Other than that, it's great!
B00846REIS|2.0|did author read 50 shades and just changeed names of characters and the location??? made me laugh how cheap it was
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a cool game. I was not sure how to play some but it is fun any way. It keeps me busy.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I thought this was a great book! Not only did it keep me attached but it also taught me a lot about Greek mythology! It was a one of a kind book and I suggest you read it!
1607885719|5.0|Received audio book on time and in condition described.  My husband enjoyed the book very much.  DAvid Baldacci is a good writer.<br />Thank You!
B0086700CM|5.0|I was show this from a friend and she said not to download it cause you'll be addicted to it.....dang it she was right....you just want to make it a little farther...I play it on my kindle fire deception for a couple times it doesn't see the swipe it works great.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|I love this movie. The action is great! The comedy is fall of your seat laughing. Definitely the best Sherlock Holmes!
B00846REIS|1.0|There was no charm or appeal to this erotic tale like there was with 50 Shades of Grey.  The characters with cold and shallow.  There was nothing to make the reader like them.  Stick with 50 Shades if you want to read this type of book.  It was much more fun and entertaining.  I really did not like this book!  It was a bad rip off of 50 Shades.
B007SGM084|5.0|Christian, showed you dominant differect shades of gray,from dark to light.  Ana showed you how to love and be submissive.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wonderful app...and free! Great reference tool! Love the reading plans to tailor your Bible study experience. Reminders keep you on track.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is so cool it has so many games. I do wish that you do not have to wait to play all the games
B0039208JE|5.0|Sometimes the first is still the best, and this Batman is my favorite. Jack Nicholson is the greatest Joker ever; his shenanigans make this movie. And the creepy mimes on the courthouse steps! Terrific! Keith Ledger may be hot, and I liked him, too; but Nicholson is still the classic!
0525478817|4.0|I really liked this book.  The love story was cute and believable and had a tragic element to it.  (Curse you, cancer!)  My only issue with this book is that the writing/dialogue seemed a bit sophisticated.  The characters are supposed to be teenagers but they do not sound like teenagers.  Their dialogue often sounds odd because of this.  However, other than this I enjoyed it.  It is one of those books that you can't put down.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game (ops I meant games) is soo much fun and easy to play! I can share it with my brother and my sister! the best game just got better!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Awesome app!  Has great reading plans with reminders and It's  great for a busy person on the go. This app also has a wide variety of translations to choose from. The layout is very easy to use and makes quick look ups a snap. I'm very happy with it and would highly recommend to anyone with a busy lifestyle who do not want to sacrifice time in the word.
B003VOUGV0|5.0|This album is reminiscent of early \\"Hole\\" before Courtney Love went completely off the deep end, although it's far less harsh.<br /><br />The songs flash back to a time when coherent concept albums were made for enjoyment as a whole.  If some songs sound similar in parts, it is because they have a \\"vibe\\" that connects each track.  The tracks are unique when isolated on their own, but the album works best when listened to from start to finish, (when was the last time you actually WANTED to do that?)<br /><br />Desperate longing, delirious contentment, fun in the California summer sun, it's all here.<br /><br />(60's Phil Spector girl group sound + surf music + early Hole ====> BEST COAST!!!)<br /><br />This is easily one of my favorite albums of the last 2 years and I'm glad I took a chance on this new group.<br />Sadly, there is a paucity of musical talent these days but Best Coast gives me hope that there are still a few bright lights out there.
034580404X|5.0|The series is addictive and in my opinion a very good (albeit racy) read. The plot does get a little repetitive at times, but I haven't been able to put it down. I would only recommend this series to adults due to the content. Also, I would recommend readers to not read it at work :)
B0085BHHOS|5.0|Well i have A LOT to say about Britney's newest greatest hits album ... well to say came in the mail very slowly but woRth the wait <3 this album is a bit odd , because the track listing was very different well you have the four singles EVERYONE know's released worldwide, ...baby one more time, oops...! i did it again , born to make you happy , and i'm a slave for you , then ... you have the singles only released in center parts of places , like anticipating , and out from under , and the fantastic , that's where you take me only exclusively  released in the Philippians in the summer of 03, then you have bonus tracks like , ... you got it all released on many versions of oops...! i did it again , not including US , and the Japanese bonus track , don't hang up , plus other great other album songs like , my baby Cinderella , the hook up , the showdown , and brave new girl ... ect<br />overall this album is great , wonderful and a MUST HAVE for die hard or just regular fans of Mr's Britney Spears.
0439023513|5.0|dont know what to read next_ what a great series... read all 3 in no time. I cannot wait to see the films!
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Great Back Pack! Awesome quality construction and it has great protection for my new laptop. It looks like it will hold a lot of textbooks, so that is a plus.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|any spider man fan who's out there and trying to think if the want this app get my opinion cause this app rocks!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm glad I read this story.  It delivered everything that I expected.  Entertainment.  I understand that everyone has an opinion.  I don't begrudge anyone for their likes and dislikes.  That is what makes this world a wonderful place to live.  Having said that, I always wonder why some people read?  Is it to be a critic or is to find some enjoyment?  Why?<br />I personally do not read to be a critic.  I read because I love it!  I love taking trips places I've never been.  I love seeing into the hearts and souls of others.  I love the emotions that can be pulled from me by words that have been painstakingly put to paper.<br />I am not an editor.  I have no claims to be an excellent writer.  I just love to be transported somewhere I'm not or where I may never have the opportunity to go.  Was there repetition?  Yes.  Was I trying to keep track of it?  No.  Were there errors in grammar?  I've yet to read a book that was perfectly executed.  I read for fun, and this book was fun for me to read.<br />Will E.L. James when a Pulitzer Prize?  No.  Was that her goal?  Probably not.  I read an article yesterday and the author talked about 'Magic'.  Some have it some don't.  This had magic.  If it didn't, so many people would not have read it.  I read this book because I wanted to.  Because I had to know.  No one forced me.  If it hadn't been on the news or in all the blogs I may have never picked it up.<br />I enjoyed the angst and the relationship.  I wanted to know what had occurred in Christian's past that messed him up so bad.  I loved that there was someone who could heal his wounds.  I enjoyed the awesome sex.  Yes it was vanilla.  He said he would give her that.  I definitely was expecting a lot more `crazy' sex.  I've read books with a lot more `crazy' sex, but I think the hype in the news made the expectations of the reader change.<br />\\"Mommy Porn\\"?  I say not.  All relationships have a basis in sex and I wish someone could give me an orgasm on every other page.  Thank God for fantasies!<br />So whatever made E.L. James write this book, mid-life crisis, whatever, Thanks!  You made me want, you made me need, you made me love the idea of a 26 year old billionaire who was `Freakin' Hot\\".  Who was philanthropic.  Who didn't have to really work super hard for all that he had.  Who when asked for `hearts and flowers', he damn well delivered!<br />Now I must go back to my vanilla world.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is one of the best for the kindle fire. if you love Sim city with its complicated city builds and want to take that on the go. this is the game for you.
B0083VFEMW|4.0|In stand-up, they say you're only as good as your last joke. Are musicians only as good as their last song? Judging by all the haters here, one might think so. \\"Night Work\\" was so good that it was inevitable that \\"Magic Hour\\" would be disappointing, but I think it is really unfair to give the album a low-star rating. It is still a good album.<br /><br />This is a Scissor Sisters album with an African influence. The first indication of this comes with the zebras on the cover of the album. Songs like \\"Let's Have a Kiki\\", \\"Shady Love\\" and \\"Keep Your Shoes\\" have a sound heavily influenced by tribal beats.<br /><br />There are plenty of songs that are classic Scissor Sisters. \\"Only the Horses\\" is now my favorite Scissor Sisters song from any album. \\"Inevitable\\" could have been a Bee Gees song. \\"Shady Love\\" is fun.<br /><br />I'm not sure what they were thinking with \\"Let's Have a Kiki\\". That's really the only song I don't like on the core album. I really didn't like any of the extra songs appearing on the deluxe version (they're mostly remixes of songs appearing earlier on the album).<br /><br />All musicians have to evolve their sound as they progress. I think a lot of people are just upset that the album doesn't sound like their previous album. Get over it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The acting, costumes, sets, and writing are all simply superb. This is the best tv show I've seen in years.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|i have rea the entire series in the last three days. i want more...preferably in Christians point of view. i look forward to the next book written by the author. no matter if its about the greys or any one else.
0425263908|5.0|I bought this book and had it finished within 2 days. If you like 50 shades of Grey then you will like this book. I find that this book has a more realistic view then 50 shades of Grey but the book was great. I would recommend this book to anyone!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|The author keeps you interested, great twists, very well written.  Great action ending and very well tied up afterwards.  I would definitely reccomend for action readers.
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|I don't know what happend, it is not working on my kindle fire. May be it works well for others, but the company still should make it simple and let it works for us, not only for computer guys.
0345803485|1.0|All I can say; read Anais Nin.  That's well written erotica.  The Fifty Shades books hit the American market at a time when people are feeling low due to the economy.  These simpleton books are aimed at a typical under-educated, television spoon fed American.  Like I said before, don't even bother with this book.  If you must read it, take it out of the library.  Money is better spent tossing it down the toilet.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I don't normally read but after several people recommending this book.  I gave in and I could not put it down!!  I would highly recommend.
1609611543|5.0|I heard about the book \\"Wheat Belly\\" from  a friend three weeks ago when I was complaining about my stomach and how big and bloated I felt.  She said \\"read, wheat belly\\".  I noted she never eats bread, pizza, cookies, cake, all the things I do at least 3 times a week.  I exercise every day and eat healthy, you could really say \\"wheat free\\" except for the three times a week when I eat bread, pizza, subs.  I don't overheat but do eat these things.  Well, last week I had been trying really hard, exercising longer, and still could not even notice a change in my stomach area.  I have lost weight on my legs, arms, face but cannot budge my stomach.  So I gave in and bought the book. The following day after reading the entire book I began my \\"wheat free program\\".  After just 2 days, I want to honestly say that I did not feel that heavy bloating feeling like I was stuffed into my pants. It has been a little more than a week and for me the most wonderful feeling is a lighter feeling in my stomach.  The heaviness is gone.  It is to soon for any weight loss but I will say this:  After four days on this wheat free program I was feeling very light around my stomach and I thought well \\" for today I can cheat and just have one biscotti with my coffee\\".  HOW WRONG I WAS.  Just that one biscotti and I felt like I had cement in my stomach.  Never again.  I never realized what wheat can do to you.  Back on track I went.  I will update this when I begin to lose weight.  I am so glad I READ THE BOOK.  It is hard to believe but true what wheat can do to your body.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Swing the candy through obstacles to collect 3 stars, before allowing the monster to eat the candy. Many challenging levels, but fun for all ages and skill levels. Every new box contains new features to contend with such as anti-gravity abilities, magic transporting hats, DJ turntables, etc. I've killed many of hours playing this game. Wish the developer released new levels more often! (Roughly 1 new complete box every ~3 months)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a really good game. Unlike most games like this you can actually earn the in-game currency instead of having to buy it. That single aspect alone made me really happy with this one. They have a theater you can buy to view clips of the new Ice Age: Continental Drift. They also have Scrats mini game where you slice fish that are trying to eat Scrat. Overall it's a really cute game with lots of perks.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is one of the best! It is easy to use and has many good features. The multiple translations are helpful.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|I have been waiting for Frank Ocean to release a full album ever since hearing Novacane. The wait was not in vain, this album is mellow, thought provoking and I am sure it will be on The Best of 2012 list. Every song and interlude is amazing. The wait was sooooo worth it.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love the game.  it runs well with little to no glitches and is a great way to pass time
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Lightweight but sturdy.  Allows my kindle to fit into my white coat or my back scrub pant pocket perfectly.  Stand works great.  Only complaint is the microfiber lining on the cover is an attractant for dog hair.  But that's more of a me-problem, for having a dog that sheds, I guess.
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|This is actually a replacement for the current one I have.  Over a period of time, the casing starts to crumble and the bare wires show.  It then works intermittently depending on how you hold the wire--unsafe to say the least.  It makes you wonder where this thing is manufactured.<br /><br />I certainly hope the new one I am currently buying is an \\"improved\\" version from the last.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have not read very many books of this nature but, when a friend suggested I should read this and I would not be bored..........holy cow........I finished then entire trilogy and the other two \\"mini-chapters\\" in less than a week!<br /><br />I could not put it down.  All I can say is thank goodness my Kindle comes with the voice reader!  I have an hour commute each way everyday so instead of the radio, I was being read to.  I loved, loved, loved the book to the point I am now reading it again........and yes, I love my Kindle.![[ASIN:B0051QVESA Kindle, Wi-Fi, 6\\" E Ink Display - includes Special Offers & Sponsored Screensavers]]

B003TGMFG4|4.0|Although Chris made some crucial errors in preparing for his Alaskan odyssey I wholeheartedly understand what he was trying to do. I found his story interesting and inspiring in a way because he had a desire and was willing to go all the way to fulfill it. Many of us would be reluctant to leave our comforts of material things in search of a greater truth in life but he was not. I find that very admirable.<br /><br />Give it a read, it's worth checking out.
B001Q94TQA|5.0|This was my favorite film from 2007.  I just purchased this Blu ray version.  It is a European product that I will discuss later in the review.  While \\"Once\\" is not a traditional musical, about 60% of the film is made up of music.  What makes this movie so special is the way the music is developed.  The Guy and the Girl (that's how the characters are identified) meet in Dublin, Ireland.  The Guy is a native and the Girl is from the Czech Republic.  They are both struggling musicians and begin a friendship that produces some of the best original music from a movie in years (won an Oscar for best song).<br /><br />Naturally they are attracted to each other but both carry relationship baggage of the recent past.  Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova are rookie actors in the lead roles but are real musicians that became real lovers off-screen.  The Guy and the Girl are obviously meant for each other yet remain committed to others so their relationship doesn't go much beyond great friendship.  But the final scene where the Girl is looking forlornly out her window lets you know she may have just lost more than a musical partner.<br /><br />When I first saw this film, I was mesmerized by the development of the music.  It was so real it felt almost like a documentary.  Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova are perfect in their roles and show a different side of acting.  Both are terrific musicians and the music is some of the best I've heard in a film.  The songs are poignant and just gorgeous.  Three great scenes to watch for:  1. When the Guy and the Girl finish the standout \\"Falling Slowly\\" that the Guy had begun to write.  This is done in a music store.  2.  When the Girl, listening on headphones, sings the words she had written to the Guy's song while walking home from the store where she had purchased batteries for the CD player.  Done in one take!  3.  When the Girl struggles through a very sad song she had written and finally breaks down before she can finish.  Just great direction and great emotion from the actors.  There are many other great scenes in this simple but effective and heartbreakingly beautiful story completed on a miniscule budget.<br /><br />I had purchased this upgrade to a DVD I owned based on improved video quality as well as an uncompressed audio track.  The Blu ray video is excellent and is definitely better than the original DVD.  The audio is not what was advertised by the seller's (not Amazon) website or even on the Blu ray jacket.  Here is the wording on the jacket label: \\"Feature audio:  Dolby Digital 5.1/DTS Surround DTS-HD Master Audio.\\"  Here's what you get:  DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0.  There are 2 additional commentary channels both in DTS-HD MA 2.0.  While I admit I was disappointed and clearly this is a labeling error, I have to assume the filmmakers wanted it this way.  The sound is clear and strong, but is not the surround generally expected.  I suspect the idea was to keep the sound in its basic format as it was made at the time.rection and great emotion from the actors.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|Doesn't take a lot of time to play, with a good story line.  Just started playing today and really enjoy it.  Sort of like a Sim city game.
B0086700CM|5.0|This awesome game offers addictive  fun- endless challenges - and seamless graphics. Temple. Run will have you running for your life!
B004SBQGHS|4.0|How do ya review a classic ?  This game has amazed so many folks with its challenging physics, visuals and clever characters.  Played it for days even weeks at a time - but honestly - eventually lost interest before beatng it completely.  Seems I'm challenged to out smart the same-o-same-o game puzzle designs rather than buff up my puzzle beating accuracy, speed or skills.  But I still play it and find it to be tons of fun.  So... 4 stars not 5.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|I'm a big katy fan, i add two have this cd, i did't have the teenage dream ablum . but now that it came back out, i add to order it. i usey only buy cds i have to have. i downLOAD FORM ITUNES. BUT THIS IS ONE I ADD TO HAVE... GREat cd.... my fav song is. part of me.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|Fun game. New amzaing physics designs to master - but - after playing several times it became Ho-Hum Here We Go Again and MOTS (More Of The Same).
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is fun because it is challenging and it flexs out our brain to a maximum lenght. It is also fun because the games really push your ability.
1439127700|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for my dad.  He LOVED it and has shared it with friends.  Great &#34;inside stories&#34; you would never learn about.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|This is such a great season. Not sure I was going to like it after seeing David play the doctor for so long. But it's wonderful. However the inner packaging of this box set was crap. Basically plastic CDs cases taped together to resemble a book. The same way with six too.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|The Innocent by David Baldacci was a very accurate introduction to the field of product litigation and defense.  The initial case described by Baldacci accurately portrays the benefits of an aggressive defense of class action law suits.<br /><br />Very interesting fiction reading.<br /><br />John Withers, Jr.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|The brightness of the flashlight is good and it covers a decent sized area.  However, it also causes the phone to freeze up intermittently requiring the removal of the phone battery to disable the app.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A gripping and serious story. I was completely wrung-out by the end.I will look for additional work by William Landay.
0345803485|1.0|Juvenile - so poorly written that my husband even commented on things that creeped him out about this book (most notably, Christian's long index finger)
B005NPCUC8|5.0|This album is the story of mankind<br />Syd knew what he was meant to do<br />It was so real - it drove him mad<br />My All Time Favorite Album<br />I have probably listened to it 20,000 times!<br /><br />Nepo
B002MQYOFW|4.0|To be honest, the only reason I read this book was because of all the hoopla surrounding it. I wanted to see the movie but I usually like to read a book before I see the movie. So I downloaded it. It sat on my Kindle, unread for a while before I finally broke down and read it. Before I finished the first chapter I had decided that it just wasnt my kind of book and had decided to put it down. Then I reached the end of the chapter and I had become hooked. It was not the best book I had ever read, because like I said, it is really not my type of book. But it was very interesting. There were a couple of times that I was disturbed by the content but other than that, I would say that I did enjoy it, and it's quite possible that I may end up reading the other 2. Luckily the other 2 I can read free because of the Prime membership deal. I did purchase this one at a discount price but I dont believe I would spend money on the other 2. I am not saying they are bad books, not at all. But like I said, not my type. I could see where this would make a good movie and the author does have a very vivid imagination.
0345529057|5.0|Awesome, page turner.  Could not put the books down! The series on HBO only scratches the surface of the characters.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|first it looks cool but it is cool aswell. large buttons and memory so you can remember numbers that just came up I love it. plus its FREE do I need to say more?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|From the start it captures you.  As you read you walk, hide,and identify with Katniss through the game. What would I do, could I kill someone to survive, could I survive?
B00785P2QC|5.0|it is a very great game can't. stop playing it ...,......hfchf....love it vary well what else could I say everyone needs to try it
B00006AG5N|5.0|In terms of history, sound, chart might, and value, this is the single greatest value in CD music of all time. So carefully produced, each historic blast from the King sounds like it was meant to. The mono originals sparkle and the stereo songs are at their most dynamic. This is THE Elvis CD to buy if you only buy one by Mr. Presley for your collection of CD's. It is actually THE CD you should purchase if you only buy one CD ever! Simply the best.
0553801473|2.0|If you are a fan of the books you know you will read this regardless of the reviews. This book moves at a snails pace and the characters are less interesting. Tyrion has lost his mojo and the dragon mother is a waffling bore. The plot moves forward somewhat but I was disapointed overall.You don't have to rush out and buy right away because it may be years before the next installment.
B004UID2LC|4.0|keep it updated and you'll never have any issues with it . I would have given it 5 stars but the constant updating is a bit annoying.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This book is so poorly written! There is NO plot.  It is hyped up for the steamy sex but even those parts are ridiculus and unbelieveable! I struggled through the first book, then bought the 2nd, thinking it would get better. It didn't.  I did not waste any more time or money on the third book.  The characters are not well deveoped nor is there any sort of story line!  If you are reading for the \\"steam\\" factor that's great... just be aware that is pretty much all there is to speak about in this series!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so many carotids for me to chose from I love it so much I play atleast one hour of it daily.
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|I love ALL of the Underworld movies, BUT, the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I think it's too short..... needs to be longer!!! This is a GREAT movie!!  Order it!!
B0079TQHDO|5.0|I had already read the The Sins of the Father and had found it a real page turner and hoped that there would be a sequel.<br />I was thrilled when I discovered the sequel, both books are fantastic, Jeffrey Archer is a master story teller.<br />The characters are either loved or hated.<br />Both books are cliff hangers and I can't wait for the next book in the series.<br />Melvene Tamplin
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Really a good book keeps you reading till done .Only took a few days to get thur it . The ending will amaze you!!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|this movie was amazing, Ridley Scott did an amazing job. i'm not sure why people are complaining. i am a huge alien fan since it started in 87. the alien movies are legendary. Prometheus did raise some questions but it also answered many questions as well. why the aliens were created, whats their purpose. and the whole conspiracy behind Wayland corp. Prometheus also had a lot of H.R. Gigers'( the artist of the alien movies) art elements in it, even more than the original alien movies. the acting was perfectly done, especially David the android.<br />in my opinion they did a fantastic job in bringing the art of h.r. Giger on cinema and to give the whole alien series an actual beginning.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is free and really fun to play. I love these types of games and was really excited to find it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This Book was so intriguing.  A good follow-up to Fifty Shades of Grey!  It made me go out and by a Kindle because it was cheaper to order the second and third book for a kindle than to purchase the books.  James is the most interesting writer I have came across in a very long time and believe me I have read some good books, Danielle Steel, Nora Roberts, Murder She Wrote, Hollywood Wives, Sheldon Leonard, etc.  But James' writing is different, she leaves you wanting more and more!  She make love so interesting and lustfully good! It's like you're involved with the main characters, they're part of you. You hurt for Ana and Christian, for what he went through as a child.  For what she was trying to do because of her love for him!  The lustful sex was extra.  In the end I actually felt sorry for Jack because of his jealousy that he didn't get picked to go live with the Grey family.  It was a beautiful family, I mean even Christian didn't feel he deserved that family.  Great Trilogy.  Hury up Mrs. James, you have a lot of writing to do!
B00079FUI6|5.0|I loved it, it was like new and works great! It was just as advertised with no hidden surprises or mistakes. Thanks again!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great for passing time and it's hard to stop playing I like the car game on the second page it's very fun!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so freaken fun I love it so much :) and people who hates this game are stupid in the head lol :XD and you should get this game cause it really fun and well TEMPLE RUN ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;3
0345803485|1.0|Pop culture? Soccer Mom's preferred summer reading? Perhaps - I counted a half dozen women reading one or another of the three volumes Sunday afternoon on Narragansett Beach. Overheard a number of conversations - women would stop in their tracks to ask a hefty maven within ear shot who was sitting in her beach chair engrossed in #2, \\"I'm on #3 what do you think?\\" \\"Outrageously kinky, No?\\" \\"What plot? It's just sex without real characters!\\"  Aging spouses with ball caps shading their eyes, barrel chests, and gray hairs spouting from their ears laughed nervously and quickly switched their conversations with the guys to the Red Sox - Yankees series.<br /><br />Perhaps I just don't get what is so \\"hot\\" about a post adolescent girl chewing her lower lip between orgasms, an egotist control freak forbidding his sexual partners to make eye contact, or signing a contract that binds a woman (for a whole month at least! Gleeps!) to subservient sex. This sums it up, my husband of 41 years asked me what all the hoopla was about. I looked up from Book #1 on my Kindle and said, \\"I just got the definition of Vanilla Sex and probably read the last scene of it for the trilogy.\\" He looked confused, never having heard the term, which I didn't explain. He ran to the kitchen and returned moments later, \\"Hey, I'm game - but we're out of Vanilla - will A1 Sauce work?\\"<br /><br />I said, \\"yes\\", as long as he bought a couple of thick steaks to put it on and a good bottle of wine for dinner. Then I closed my Kindle.<br /><br />As the leading female character would say, while chewing her lip and having an orgasm because someone said Gray, \\"Oh, crap!\\" You can't tell a book by its cover - it is far more provocative than the pages that follow. May the author gasp all the way to Hollywood Hills. I'll skip the rest of the series.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Seller was great, and movie is wonderful. The music and plot are entertaining enough for both child and adult. I recommend this film.
1439153663|5.0|this is not my typical kind of book but I loved it. I thought it was going to be \\"teachy\\" about the period and slavery but I was wrong.
B006Y9BVRM|4.0|Great watch!  Very sharp and sporty looking dial.  The Bezel is extremely smooth, and the overall quality is top notch for a watch in this price range.  The bad, the band is very thin, especially at the buckle, and rigid.  The lugs are only 20 MM, so hard to upgrade to a wider  rubber dive strap.  I have ~ 20 watches (most of which are much more expensive)  and this would probably be one of my favorites, if it had a more masculine band.
B005HJWWW8|2.0|I used this amp on a Motorola Droid X and it worked and sounded wonderful. I liekd the blue setting. I then upgraded to a Motorola Razr Maxx and it's now worthless. I get a constant hissing and static unless you turn it over to airplane mode. I've tried a longer cord and that doesn't work. Would like to know a good amp to work with the razr.
B005SDMDRW|3.0|I usually love the stories about Dectective Bosh but I was disappointed in this book.  Perhaps because it was a book of short stories that couldn't be expanded as well as a full length novel.  It won't stop me purchasing other Michael Connelly books.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I really love this app the only downside is the voice versions will not read post the first min and forty seconds especially when online or in the plans if that could be rectified this app would be truly fabulous I'm on pins and needles awaiting upgrades thank you for this app o really love it
B0052VUNHC|1.0|How in the world did this book get such stellar reviews? This is quite baffling, since it plays out like a bad John Hughes film. Forget the reviews about the bad editting, that's the least of its problems. At times, I found this book actually comical. One could actually play a drinking game with this book; taking a shot everytime the word \\"babe,\\" \\"baby,\\" \\"swanky,\\" or \\"glowered\\" was used, but you'd be out like a light after the first chapter. The pathetic stereotypes were humorous.  The main character, Abby, a.k.a. Abs or Pigeon, is a hot, poker playing, whiskey drinking, co-ed virgin, running away from her Vegas card sharking past.  She meets, Travis, a.k.a. Trav, the also whisky drinking, tattooed, smoking, motorcycling, leather clad, cage-fighter champion, that even the football team is afraid of.  Spoiler coming...She tries to stay away from him, but can't and she loses her virginity...The End.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Loved this book a lot. Be prepared to be in it for the long haul once picking up this book- you won't be able to put it down, and you will rush to finish the others. Enjoy!
0439023513|5.0|I love when I read a book that makes me think about how great it was days, months, years later.  I love when I finish reading a series of books and I already know I will reread them.  Thank you, Suzanne Collins for writing The Hunger Games and I wish I would have read it 4 years ago when I put it on my to read list.  It wasn't what I thought it was going to be but so thankful for an ending I didn't expect. I have become so jaded with knowing how a book or movie will end it was refreshing.<br /><br />I do wish there was more to the pearl or it made it back to her for a keepsake.<br />I have to admit when I finished I was sad and hopeless. After reading some of the other reviews and thinking about the series for a couple of days, I get it. I reread some of the things I initially missed. I needed to get more of the sense of Peeta and Katniss getting together.  Thinking and rereading really helped resolve the wanting of more. I read the last few pages very carefully. It doesn't leave the reader with warm fuzzies, but now I feel better about the ending.<br />Peeta is the true kick start of her recovery and getting to a sane person when he woke her with the planting of the primroses.  Peeta is the only one that Katniss can't survive without(mentioned by Gale to Peeta on who she will choose, while Katniss eavesdrops). The future must be better because she knew he would be a good father (stated in CF) even if it took her fifteen years to be comfortable with the idea.<br />I have reread and reconsidered conversations with the various characters i.e. Gale and Katniss and it becomes clear that she can never separate Prim's death and Gale.<br />Plutarch talking about how people being 'fickle, stupid beings with poor memories and a great gift for self-destruction.' This may be why when she gets home all she does is sit in the kitchen and go to the bathroom for who knows how long. Although I don't believe it's that long. She was in solitary confinement for months and it was winter, she gets home and Greasy Sae mentions it's early spring.<br /><br />It speaks volumes about war and the aftereffects.  I could probably go on forever about how it isn't a terrible ending and why I believe that Katniss and Peeta lead a relatively normal existence. All she ever wanted to do was take care of her family and lead a quiet life. All Peeta wanted was to take care of Katniss. So there is your warm and fuzzy ending.<br />They live like so many of us do with baggage and hard times but with someone who knows them and accepts them for who they are.<br />Maybe I rambled too long and no one will read this because let's face it, there are a lot of reviews.  However, I believe in some way this has helped me appreciate the book that much more, by explaining why I loved it so much.
B000002G89|4.0|The fantastic cover design sets the tone for an interesting album which covers several styles with good quality music.<br />Bob Marley's I Shot The Sheriff introduced many mainstream listerners to reggae, but the best by far is Let It Grow, a powerfully understated song.<br />I also recommend the follow up One In Every Crowd from 1975.
B000VMBXNA|5.0|Light comedy that's smart and provocative. It would be too easy to poke fun at the Queen...and he doesn't. She's an amazing example of focused application, and this book asks, What if that focus hit a prism?
B006BDHAX0|5.0|this really keeps my mind flowing in the evenings!!! Love it! I would recommend this game even for a small child
B00881VLCE|3.0|You guys wanted a review?  Here it is.  I like all the puzzles, but it was kinda laggy and that's annoying.  Anyways, hopefully the constant asking for a review will go away now.
0345803485|1.0|I just finished reading 'Fifty Shades of Gray' which would have been more appropriately entitled 'Fifty Shades of Smut' - hard-core sex. Didn't know what to expect from this novel, didn't read any reviews before reading it (should have), knew absolutely nothing about it.  Just knew it was a mega best-seller.<br /><br />First, I'll say that I don't see how this book can be adapted to a film, as it supposedly is in the process of being, without it being labeled porno - XXX rated, as boring as porno can be. Second, I can't imagine a legitimate cast of top actors offering their services in this film. Porno stars, maybe, if it will be portrayed same as the novel. However I don't see much left to film if the sex scenes are eliminated.  It would be a 30-minute movie at the most, without all those pages of repetitive BDSM (see Wikipedia as Gray sez).<br /><br />Third, the premise bothers me somewhat ... a young 20s, alluring, handsome billionaire deep into BDSM with signs of dark dark emotional damage entices a young 20s, innocent, virgin college graduate into his world of submission and dominance.  Not believable! Juvenile to say the least.<br /><br />I must say the author (or conglomerate of authors) writes in a way that holds the reader at the beginning, sort of keeps you wanting to read against your better judgement to see which one wins, if anybody does win.  But it's hard to continue reading through the same ol' sex scenes as the story unfolds, it really is. I found myself skimming quite a bit. And I certainly would never recommend this novel to any of my friends or family.<br /><br />I'm surprised that Kathy Lee and Hoda are so gun-ho about it, as they were today on their TV show.  It's the hype that surrounds the book that is making it a best-seller, in my opinion, and it's the first one in the trilogy.  I am curious about what happens to the young couple, but I don't want to read all that SM.  I suppose I could skim through the next two books, for I'm sure it will be more of the same. But then, it really isn't all that important to me. Why would I bother?  I'd rather not waste my time, I'd rather read some good books.<br /><br />What happens is, this first book of the trilogy ends on a note that requires the reader to buy the next book and then the next to see what happens.  It probably was one huge book and the publisher split it into three books to increase revenue.<br /><br />Now I don't have a problem with serial formats at all, if it was intended to be, I write my romantic suspense novels that way (so far five of them with a continued story of the character Rachel O'Neill), as do other authors, using the same primary character going from one adventure to another in each novel.  Don't have a problem with that at all.<br /><br />But this 'Fifty Shades of Gray' is something else.  It seems now we're into exploiting painful, cruel sex instead of lovemaking in romantic bestsellers.  The last group of mega-sellers were vampire novels. Before that it was Harry Potter.  Amazing, the rapid progression, isn't it?<br /><br />A bunch of sick puppies, if you ask me.be more of the same. But then, it really isn't all that important to me. Why would I bother?

B0080YGZ20|4.0|This is a great album that I have been waiting for a long time to hit the states. It didn't completely live up to the hype but it came close and that says a lot because most albums don't and if this is any indicator of her talent the best is yet to come.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun but the ads can be annoying at times. its also kind of a challenge. to get enough coins to buy the games.
B0055S348W|1.0|I've had this app installed on my Android phone for two years, and it's phenomenal on that platform. HOWEVER - and it's a big one - it doesn't work on the Fire. The end. I've contacted Amazon support, which was useless, and the app support can't help Fire users either. It's an OS issue.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Loved this movie! It was as good as the original and Tom Cruise did not dissapoint:) Our whole family ages 11 - 47 enjoyed the action and the humor.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Loved it! Could not put it down! Don't let all the controversy sway you from reading this. Good story line about a relationship. Yes, its got some erotic parts in it but its no different than seeing sex scenes in a movie or any other smut novel out there. Devoured all three books in 3 weeks. The ending of the 3rd book is very fairy tale happy- ever -after .
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this game because it is free and can unlock new games by playing more instead of spending money on it
B000000993|5.0|After their first album Opiate which was good but it was only the beginning and Undertow shows some maturity and has more structured songs. Not that it's extremely complex and technical but the songs on Opiate were very raw and stripped down, very simple compared to the rest of their later offerings. The lyrics are a bit darker and more serious here also and the band really got going with and took a step up, only a little over a year later. Prison Sex and Sober are classic hits and are still popular today. However the album has better songs like 4°, Intolerance, Crawl Away and the title track.
B007EC6FIS|3.0|This album does have an obvious change in style from recent albums, thank goodness, reminiscent to hopes and fears. Unlike thier first album this one has no edge. The melodies, while at first pleasant, are nothing catchy or new and almost cliche. The lyrics are quite bad. Again there is no creativity involved and the singing becomes very cheesy and melodramatic. One chorus breaks into la,la,la,la,la yeah! A move in the right direction but not quite.
0385343175|5.0|Just discovered Ms. Steel late in life.  How wonderful she is blessed with such a writing gift.  Only problem is I stay up too late reading since I can't put her books down.  No exception for Hotel Vendome (I live in NYC).  You can study writing technique all you want -- without a natural talent, you can't do what Danielle Steel does.  Book was in a great condition.  Bravo to all.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I love a good science fiction movie and as long as Hollywood doesn't screw it up by cutting it up to badly or skimp on the production the movie is usually satisfying. To cut it to the quick this movie was destine to be a classic and if you listen to the critics all you will get is a boxed up commercialized substitute for real scfi. I do have to say that Disney has been making the best movies when they choose to make them. My worry with Disney is that it looks like they have fallen into the trap of having to make a lot of money in order to keep the cogs of corporate profits rolling in. I think when a company gets as large as Disney it is very hard to know topical art/culture from cash cows....<br />Back to John Carter, remember this was about that movie ;)<br />I have to say I never read the books (sorry) but I am a avid Scifi/Fantasy enthusiast and this movie shines with new ideas. Ideas like presenting alien forms an cultures that are truly alien from the way we view how things should be done (ie Birthing and raising youth). Basically if you are a true scifi fan you will enjoy this movie and the critics, well they have to think they know what they are talking about even when the true fans know they haven't a clue. Enjoy.....
0099579936|1.0|I am shocked that this book actually got published.  I was an English lit major drop-out and have better writing skills than demonstrated in this book.  If I read the word \\"hitches\\" (or any other variation of the word) or \\"murmurs\\" one more time, I think I'll throw up. This author needs to learn how to use a thesaurus and expand her vocabulary!  It's predictable and I found myself much more disgusted with Ana's low self-esteem and poor decisions than I did with Christian's unconventional lifestyle. If the storyline were a little more believable and written better, I think I could have overlooked the characters - but it isn't and I couldn't.  Save yourself some time and money.  If you are looking for something to jump start your libedo, just go to the toy store or read Penthouse Forum.

B007X4N0DU|5.0|Eyez-Features guest vocals from Jamey Jasta of HateBreed. This song has to be their heaviest song on the album.<br />Murdered Love-Features guest vocals from Sic Jacken.<br />Higher-Reminds me alot of Alive from Satellite.<br />Lost in Forever-Reminds me alot of the song Satellite from the album Satellite.<br />West Coast RockSteady-Party trick similar to Rock The Party Off The Hook.<br />Beautiful-Reminds me of alot of It Can't Rain Everyday from WAASD.<br />Babylon The Murderer-If you listened to Breathe Babylon from Brown, it's pretty much like a sequel to it.<br />On Fire-Has a RATM vibe to it.<br />Bad Boy-A different kinda track for POD. Love how the track has a ska vibe to it.<br />Panic and Run-Punk track similar to Without Jah from Satellite.<br />I Am-Really powerful song that shows that the band ain't afraid to be real.
B0083EW97W|5.0|This album is nothing short of a masterpiece. John Mayer has once again amazed me with his wonderful talent in crafting another deep album. I've been attached to his past albums and what I love about Mayer is that his style changes in every album but his music is always true to him.<br /><br />In a music world of shallow pop hits, this album is refreshing. It brings a big spectrum of emotions from the deep lyrics of \\"Born and Raised\\" to the carefree feelings of \\"Age of Worry\\".<br /><br />I admit I was weary about the new style; I thought it might be country but it surely is not. If anything it incorporates some folk which is a nice transition in Mayer's career. The more you listen to the album, the more attached you become to Mayer's eloquent lyrics and overall true talent.<br /><br />If you are a John Mayer fan, this is the album for you!!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I often feel like an amateur reader. I find that more often than not I am unable to look at a work critically because I have become thoroughly immersed in the contents of said \\"work\\".<br /><br />The Night Circus is a perfect example of this. Perhaps is because the word magic is used so often or perhaps it is truly magical but I found that I felt like I was walking through this circus in every chapter. I was able to enjoy all the parts of the circus along with the other characters. Perhaps one of the best parts came in the last third person vignette. The story comes full circle. At the beginning and the end these vignettes were my favorite parts. In the middle though I found that they only unnecessarily broke of the fluidity of Marco and Celia's story.<br /><br />These were the few moments I was pulled out of the circus, which at their heart served to make me a part of it, as well as the frequency of the use of 'a shock of bright color' though overall the experience was, dare I say it, magical.

0385342063|5.0|I liken Kinsella books to candy... They are sweet, you finish them too quickly and are left wanting more!<br />I've Got Your Number was no exception. I breezed through it in three days, not able to put it down.<br />Kinsella knows how to write a compelling story that keeps you intrigued and your heart wrenched!<br />By then end, I didn't want to finish it because I had grown to so love the characters. Kinsella has a knack for character development to the likes of which I've never seen. She writes the most lovable leading ladies. I don't think I've read one of her books and not thought, is she reading my mind? Did she base this character on me? I thinks it's the element of honesty that is so striking and  comical, but mostly - relatable.<br />I have not found another author that I enjoy reading as much as her.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|rented this movie on a whim and I am so glad I did.The story was great and it never slowed down for me.If you want action and love Mark Wahlberg you don't have to look anymore.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Problem: When one speaks of \\"beauty\\", people tend to forget that \\"beauty\\" is both external and \\"internal\\". Perhaps Snow White's purity created her overall beauty. Charlize is one of those rare women who seem to \\"glow\\" with little or no effort. There was one movie, she played a roadside pro, (maybe \\"Beast\\") in love with another woman... they had to go to great lengths to make her (Charlize) look that bad. Beauty is not skin deep.<br />Perhaps Chalize's character realized that she did indeed, need both.<br /><br />Overall, anyone can pick at the little things \\"that annoyed them\\" about the film. And some insist on writng disertations. I wish people would only review the overall \\"quality\\" of the entire movie. Don't spoil it for others who have not seen it, by critiquing nearly all of the important (or not) scenes.<br /><br />It was an adventure and it managed to pull the more important emotions from me. That and it's quality, overall, made for an entertaining film. I would heartily recommend it to any adult. Enough so, that I will add it to my movie library.<br />Opal
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app.  I had previously purchased it for iphone,  when I received a kindle fire for Christmas. I like the app much more in the kindle version but both are great. I would have to say my favorite features are the &quot;plans &quot; and the wide variety of translations. I am 21 and very much enjoy being able to switch between NIV and The Message.

B00170MYIS|1.0|This is NOT a genuine Sony battery. The package I received was cut wide open on 2 of the 4 sides and the sticker on the battery is a cheap knock-off of the original one.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't know which was worse: the subject matter or the writing of this trashy bit of voyeurism.<br />Anastasia Steele is studying for her final exams in the last semester of her senior year, when her best friend, who is the editor of the school paper, is taken ill and implores her to conduct an interview for her with a leading business man who will be speaking at their graduation, Christian Grey.  Grey is a stunning, arrogant, emotionally distant billionaire, with a secret or two.<br />Steele is an awkward, but reasonably bright young lady who meets Grey tripping over her own feet and falling head first into his office.  There is an instantaneous palpable attraction between them.  Grey pursues her and they have a torrid affair.<br />Despite constantly alluding to her GPA, Steele falls in love with Grey (could the last names be any cheesier)knowing he wants to be involved in an S & M relationship with her, and that he desperately wants to punish her while controlling her.  Oh, and he wants to satisfy her and buy her expensive toys all the while keeping her from touching him.<br />The love making scenes are repetitive as is their banter.  He constantly tells her how clever she is, yet were we to read what she says, without his saying she's clever, we'd never think she was.  Somehow, she morphs into a rather elegant lady who never falls after they start sleeping together, even when she's wearing stilettos.<br />Steele has parents and step parents who love her.  She has many good friends.  Why she would fall for a shell of a man merely because of his looks, never made any sense.  It wasn't his power that was an aphrodisiac as she constantly attempted to refuse his lavish gifts.<br />And why this woman, who was a virgin, valued herself, and was supposedly intelligent would consent to being beaten by a sadistic, emotionally withholding man is beyond me.<br />I used to think that whatever occurred between consenting adults was fine and no one's business.  But the depravity of this world was so abhorrent that I have to rethink my laissez-faire attitude.<br />I had several friends tell me that this book is a rage in my town.  It is beyond me why.y of this world was so abhorrent that I have to rethink my laissez-faire attitude.<br />I had several friends tell me that this book is a rage in my town.  It is beyond me why.

B0068MNO4S|4.0|The film 'Anonymous' was filmed using the latest in digital camera, the Arri Alexa (and not a Red One as has been suggested elsewhere).  I read that the Red One just didn't render the light practicals (the lights that are used in a scene rather than placed out of the scene) well; at least the candles which apparently were the main source of light for much of the film (as well, of course, exterior lighting).<br /><br />The story has been related elsewhere completely and in detail, so I won't re-invent the wheel.  I will say that the story won't make as much sense to the person (like me) who has a poor understanding of the royal politics of the time (Queen Elizabeth and that time period of much intrigue).  I was more interested in the question of whether Shakespeare could have or did write the plays and sonnets he's credited with writing.<br /><br />The set design and artistic interpretation is top-notch, making for a sumptuous film-going experience.  The acting was excellent as well, and features Rhys Ifans as the Earl of Oxford (the supposed author of the plays) and Vanessa Redgrave as Queen Elizabeth.<br /><br />Over-all, the film would appeal more to the history buff, especially someone who is familiar with the English history of the time.  I know there is much criticism of the historical accuracy of the film, which I share.  Like Oswald being the single killer of Kennedy, I believe that Shakespeare did write all of the plays in question; as they say, extraordinary claims need extraordinary proof, which is lacking in this instance.<br /><br />However, the look of the film and the beauty of the set design makes it worth seeing (twice? To understand the royal intrigue?).  I rate this film three-and-one-half stars, based primarily on the look of the film.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love the game. I can play it for hours. The controles can be iffy sometimes but otherwise this is a fun game.

1596680180|5.0|When this book arrived, I glanced at it and tossed it aside, thinking it was no more than a collection of pretty pictures. I didn't like the spiral binding or the size. However, when I had time to take a closer look, I don't know when I've been more pleasantly surprised. The instructions are simple but complete--all you need to create the braid. A small, easy-to-find picture in the corner shows you a section of the completed project. The instructions are clear and concise. And the spiral binding allows you to open the book to the page of instructions for each project without wrestling with the book in the process. It also travels well. I've already located and completed one braid for a bag I had made. That one, and presumably many others, can be transported to the Kumihimo disk, but if you don't use one, the work is designed to be held in the hand. I love the book and recommend it highly.
0985114606|5.0|OMG! I was not expecting much when I bought this book. I only decided to go ahead and the pull the trigger when I saw how many times it came up as a similar read to Fifty Shades Of Grey. When I first started reading I was still reeling from finishing Fifty Shades, so I was thinking nothing could top that but boy was I wrong. This book is so much more real. Both characters have a past and the sex scenes are so graphic and amazing. None of that \\"he touched my sex with his expanding growth\\" from Fifty shades business. This is the real deal. I am so disappointed that I have to wait until October for the next one. I happen to think this book is even better than Fifty Shades of Grey. I would say FSOG is the teeny bopper version to this series. The whole time I was reading I kept picturing Amanda Seyfried as Eva and Ian Somerhalder as Gideon. I am so sad I have read it but I am thinking about re-reading it. It was just that good.
B0063IH60K|4.0|very fun game to play to pass the time. I love the way the cards spin and dazzle your mind.
B0086DBE62|4.0|I loved it! I think it is more than worth 3.99 to watch on your computer...really fun...Julia is charming...prince of Valencia is adorable...the dialogue is witty and fun. Very good time.
0606259090|1.0|As an English major, I am appalled at the juvenile writing. This is simply a more poorly written \\"Twilight\\" with a little porn thrown in. Even as erotica, it's not very good.  I truly can't understand the appeal.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I fell in love instantly with the book and the characters so easily. I didn't want the book to end but I seriously recommend this book to everyone. STOP READING REVIEWS AND BUY THE BOOK!
B00846REIS|5.0|I immediately adored the characters in the book! Definitely will not regret reading this book! It was romantic and erotic.
B006RUJST6|3.0|I read some of the reviews, though the long ones with obvious spoilers, I did not. I also did not realize that it was a young adult romance book....I enjoyed it, but this type of book is not my cup of tea. I didn't like the slamming stuff, that's just too way out of my comfort zone even though I write poetry. Having never read a book where the main characters are young adults, I have nothing to compare it to. However, if someone WAS interested in that genre, they would enjoy this book.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Having never read the original books, I came to The Vampire Diaries without any knowledge of the characters or the plot. Within ten minutes of viewing I was hooked and I am embarrassed to say I watched the entire season one box set in three days. AMAZING :)

B001AQO3QA|5.0|Amazon has this collectors set for 28 bucks right now. You get all of the Alien movies and hours of special features and commentaries with Ridley Scott and the cast. You have the option of watching the theatrical 1979 cut of Alien or the 2003 directors cut I watched both right after each other. The picture quality is hard to grade because it's an old movie but holds up well. Good value and don't wait until the price goes up. Must have for your blu-ray collection.

B001RNO7D0|5.0|I am 54 yrs. old male and in fairly good shape. In case you're wondering, \\"Ter\\" is my beloved wife. In June of 2012 I went to Oregon, both in the woods east of Eugene and all along the coast, trekking a variety of trails. On avg. we hiked 2 to 5 miles per day. What a GREAT light weight shoe! My impression is that these shoes could have easily handled more. I didn't jog in them, but most likely could have with no problem. I wore them almost right out of the box, excluding a few trips to and from my workplace parking lot, just prior to leaving on our trip. They needed absolutely no breaking in, which is unusual for my feet..normally a 11D. In fact, they felt better than my Nike cross train sneaks, so I wore them 90% of the time on this trip. As others have noted in their reviews on this shoe, definitely order them in a half size bigger.  The 11.5 were perfect with one pair of athletic socks and plenty wide enough too. Hope this helps.
B00884GR0W|3.0|I really want to love this game, I do! It's just that I can't get past the terrible controls. The game uses a \\"virtual stick\\" to move around, but it doesn't pull it off as smoothly as Minecraft PE. If they could make this work better, it'd be fantastic.<br /><br />I also think it'd be nice if it were Sixaxis Compatible.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I am the best. Just watch me. Haha. I'm almost done. The last Level is awesome!!!!!!! I AM THE BEST!

B0018QQQK8|5.0|It was great story line. Nice romance novel. Saw the movie first and the book was much better. Very entertaining.A good book to read before bed not that it was boring,but just gave you that dreamy feel. Something to relax you. A very good read!
0439023521|5.0|Bought the trilogy after hearing so much about it this year. It is a totally engaging read. Author paints a great picture and I could see it all in my mind, just how a book should play out as you read. I'm over 40 and really liked it.<br /><br />I also twisted my son's arm and nagged and pushed this book on him to try and get him to just READ....and as soon as he started, he read it all in 2 days. That was like the 2nd book he ever read that wasn't assigned to him from school and he truly liked it a lot.<br /><br />Definitely a BUY recommendation.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This was a great movie!! It almost made me want to reenlist. The packaging was good as was the shipping time! I am glad I bought this movie and recommended it to everyone!
B005HJWWW8|5.0|This thing is great! I used to have to boost the volumes of my songs on iTunes but now I don't have to. It also helped because my iPod touch's headphone jack was damaged and it was annoying to have wiggle the headphone cable around, now that I have a LOD and this I don't have to worry about that anymore! I wasn't expecting it to be so small though, might be a little easy to lose. Overall this amp met my expectations. I ordered this along with [[ASIN:B000R2PC2M Sennheiser PXC 450 NoiseGard Active Noise-Canceling Headphones]]

B000TERDNO|5.0|I bought a couple of tracks off this album after thinking about a couple of Bill Idols songs that I enjoyed back in the day.  They still kick as much today as when I was listening to them back in the hazy lazy 80(s)...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The product is well put together and is a great time killer. However, some particular games have poor controls and the ads are highly overbearing. Overall, worth the purchase!
0857680986|5.0|I have a 1947 vintage edition of this book that used to be my mother's  (she was a talented commercial illustrator who died from cancer when I was a teenager). So I've had this book for 40yrs, and in all that time of adding to my library of artistic books, I've never found a better general reference for learning to draw figures (though Willy Pogany's 'Drawing Lessons' book of 1946 comes pretty close). It has excellent sections on the basics of perspective, light and shade, anatomy, proportion and composition, and the examples of Loomis's pencil craft and penmanship are superb.<br /><br />Now granted, this is an old book, entirely in black and white, stylistically mannered and from the point of view of a realist illustrator of a bygone era, rather than a of a fine artist (for whom the drawings might lack some degree of artistic expressionism or abstraction), but it is nevertheless, one of the finest books available on the subject of figurative drawing; even after all this time.<br /><br />I value it so highly, I've just bought a second copy so that when I eventually disappear, my two artistically oriented kids won't have to fight over this particular part of my library.
B0052VUNHC|2.0|i m not sure what i was expecting when i began reading this book but 3/4 of the way through i finally had to give up. i simply could not believe that any girl who was supposed to possess a modicum of common sense would have anything to do with a manipulating jerk like travis. i sure hope this is not representative of what women think.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was simply fantastic. The story is so unique and original, its hard to even explain the plot without it sounding too strange. I picked this book up through my kindle just simply trusting its high star rating and I am so glad I did. I just finished this book and am really eager to read another by this author. Take a chance on this book- you will NOT be disappointed. This is easily the best book I've read in a long time. I'm sad that it ended! ;-(
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have used many different on screen keyboards but this is the best. It's a must download if you don't have a physical keyboard.
B0035WTE2U|5.0|So I was a HUGE fan of the Iron Man movies and I'm also a huge fan of AC/DC, I've been listening to them since the late 90's when I was in college and I've loved them ever since.<br /><br />I was in Best Buy and I saw this and flipped it over to see all the songs on it.  I'll admit that not all the songs on this CD were in the movie, Iron Man 2, but it was still a good CD and I was able to listen to some awesome music thanks to it.<br /><br />True there is a DVD in it which I didn't bother to watch cuz I just wanted a good CD.  If you're a fan of AC/DC you should really check it out!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is a great thing to read if you want to have a great read. Every page comes with new things. You never know what is going to happen.
0385534639|2.0|I had pretty high expectations for this book based on the \\"hype\\" surrounding it. I read it about 3/4 through in a few days and then took a break from it. WEEKS passed and I thought, \\"Do I REALLY need to finish that book??\\" I just did not really CARE about the characters or the plot that had developed. I finished it, though, because I hate to not finish a book. And I truly felt let down.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Would give it a 5 if it didn't freeze or shut down so often. Please fix! Love to play the game
0679809015|5.0|My 1 1/2 year old loves this book! She didn't want to put it down, every time I would try to go to another book she would just pick this one up again!
1416914307|4.0|This is my favorite so far in the series. The pacing of this book was quicker than the last which was a relief. I enjoyed all of the revelations exposed...one after the next. The ample face time with Valentine was awesome. Sebastian was deliciously wicked.  The setting was cool in the City of Glass with Shadowhunters. I think Jace loses more of his sarcastic edge with each book however. Maybe it will come back sooner rather than later hopefully. Clary's ability to create new runes is fascinating. I am anxious to see what develops further in the series with her powers.
B005F0BFOA|4.0|Album arrived quickly, and was in fair condition. But there was no song lyric sheet, as stated there was in the description of this item.
0765316994|2.0|To my astonishment I've been reading Science Fiction and Fantasy now for well over fifty years, and I've read a lot of it, and it seems as if, as I get older, I have less patience with books that don't immediately interest me and draw me in, and \\"Redshirts\\" was one such book.<br /><br />I've read several of Scalazi's other books and liked them. But, I don't really know quite how to classify this book--a screwball comedy/parody/comedic look at SF series, a niche book for Star Trek fanatics, some sort of rumination on writers and their characters?  But, whatever it is, it just didn't interest me.<br /><br />People obviously have very different senses of humor.  Some of the SF I have really liked has had a good deal of humor in it--a book in the Cinnabar Navy, Lt. O'Leary series I reviewed here recently, David Drake's \\"The Road  of Danger,\\" is one example, and the often droll humor in the books by Miller and Lee set in their Liaden Universe is another--but Redshirt's  nonstop wisecracks and parody/comedy or whatever the hell it was just fell flat for me, as did the \\"Three Codas\\" at the end of the book.
B005LAIH54|5.0|After watching the dissappointing Clash of the Titans, I was a bit worried about watching Wrath, yet decided to give it a shot, good thing too. The story has some typical ancient Greek mythos- some hero/demigod decides to take a break from action and be \\"normal\\" and have  a family... until an offer comes up to help out with war, between gods and titans.<br />Said hero, Perseus, the son of Zeus, doesn't want to. At all. Yet when his village is attacked after a disturbing vision, it seems that he'll have to join the cause. Along the way, he meets beautiful Sergeant Andromeda who has plenty of brains to go with her beauty, and together, with the son of Poseidon, Agenor, they journey to stop the father of Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades, Chronos, from fulfilling his wrath upon the world.<br />Throughout the journey, the effects have been massively improved from the first to be much better, along with a more interesting story, full of more intriguing characters from Greek mythology, as well as settings, such as the living labyrinth. The story, itself, has more intelligence and personal pathos than Clash, as well as heartbreaking moments. The people and gods are more fleshed out than before, less cardboard cutouts.<br />All this to say Wrath of the Titans has been a massive improvement over its very dissappointing predecessor.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this is such a great game it is so addictive it keeps you coming back because you want to earn more points and feed your customers. it has really cute animation and you can build it how ever you want
034580404X|5.0|I can truely say I am hooked on these books. I tell everyone that it is the story line that had me hooked. I think all women want a man that will care for them the way Chriatian cares for Ana. I can't wait for her next books. Fifty Shades of Grey left me with a good feeling and I have already read it twice all the though. I can't bring myself to loan them out.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|As the author of [[ASIN:B007STDY8G Day Of Reckoning]] my debut novel, I was interested to find out how a fellow debut writer becomes such a success. While the book won't win any awards for literature, I found it very entertaining and finished it in two days.I've noticed in other reviews, printed above, criticism of the repeation in the novel. I agree with this criticism and it's true that the repeation can be annoying.I'm sure the book's author E.L.James won't worry too much as the book is destined to become the bestseller paperback of all time!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|PLEASE, before spending any money on this garbage, read the amazon review by 'DS from LA': hilarious [more entertaining than the book], and absolutely on point!<br />Sort reviews by all 1-star reviews and you'll find it...
B006DDO1D0|5.0|I was a senior in high school when JFK was assassinated so the event is very clearly etched in my brain.  I was looking so forward to this book by Steven King and can say without a doubt that I have not been disappointed.  It is an excellent story, so many of the details I can remember from growing up.  The description of the late 1950's and into the '60's are so clear.<br /><br />I don't like reviews that tell the story, and I won't be doing that here.  What I will say is that the characters are written with such clarity it is as if I got to know them personally.  The details and the events are scripted to perfection.  The story flowed and never did I lose interest or feel that I wanted to skip ahead.<br /><br />I listened to this on CD, and my friend, who read the book, thought I might lose some of the story by listening to it; however, I didn't, if anything I think it made the story even more interesting.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book...in capital letters YES!
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Really enjoy the four difficulty levels. Each with over forty puzzles. Nice relaxing way to end the day.<br />Can repeat puzzles to improve completion times.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is a book that you just not put down. Great book, reading it a second time.<br />Best book I have read in awhile, it is a great romance.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I saw the newer version and I like it. when I went to get it, it wasn't there. :( get the update and get a better rating
B005LAIHR2|5.0|Loved the film ... it is so much fun and so campy it is a blast!! It truly showed the life of a rock star and their life. I use to work stage crew for a lot of rock stars and rock and roll bands and this movie nailed it as far as their life on the road. This movie was a lot of fun for me. Russell Brand was a perfect fit for his roll and the times!! Loved the newcomer (Diego Boneta) he is hot.
0061692042|3.0|Canada - and the moral of the story is: there are two kinds of people - those who are able to digest loss and not get heartburn and those who get ulcers. I found our Dell to react to life as if he had had a frontal lobotomy. A figure who never becomes vulnerable as a result of negative life experiences. Nothing phases this kid who continues to desire a chessmate and to learn about beekeeping thoughout most of the novel and who ends up living a sound and uneventful life as a result of his lack of emotional connections to his fate. His sister on the otherhand, dies of cancer. The twin sister, who has an opposite reaction to her fate. One that seems more valid and normal to me. This is a tricky novel. I guess I liked it although, it seemed to be missing something which might possibly be passion. Yes - I believe this novel lacks passion. There are many crazy things that happen within the story line but I am left with a stale taste in my mouth. I do not relish this novel as a classic work of literature.

B007CKNX28|5.0|The Amazon reviews already capture the greatness that is Jack White's \\"Blunderbuss\\". It seems he's grown out of his punk rebelliousness with the white stripes and accepted his growth and talent in the prime of life. \\"Love Interruption\\" has become one of my motivational songs. Even as a forever alone redditor without a girlfriend, the chant \\"I won't let love disrupt, corrupt or interrupt me\\" applies true to any element of your life that stands in the way of accomplishing your goals. Love of parties, drinking, online procrastinations, memes.<br /><br />I've been trying to juggle five for a while now, and finally had a run of ten repetitions without dropping in the middle of \\"Weep themselves to sleep\\". I proceeded to do 100 sit-ups and 30 push-ups, more than I've done at once in two years. This music has inspired me to push beyond my personal limits. Push when my brain and body are ready to retire. Gives me strength when I have lost it.<br /><br />You've outdid yourself Jack White. And you've outdid me.

B006RUJST6|5.0|Colleen Hoover has written one fabulous story! It is indescribably amazing. Like wow! You need to check this out. One of the best chick lit/romance books I have read! They need to get on making this into a movie! It would sure be a hit!
1451648537|4.0|This is a well written but perhaps a bit uneven book that brings us closer to the enigmatic guy in the black turtleneck we got to see  selling us the snappy new widget at Mac conventions. I must confess that during the first 1/3 of the book  I developed a visceral dislike for Jobs, his mannerisms &  narcissism that bordered on mild psychopathy. Bill Gates had him figured out from the outset when he said that there was something less than human in Jobs' tantrums.Stealing other people's ideas and selling them as his own; habitual & casual rudeness; pathological and irrational stinginess; weird hygiene; above all, the casual abandonment of people who had ceased to be useful as exemplified glaringly in the case of his daughter Lisa and her mother Crisann. Jobs was a sensitive and he used his ability to read people's emotions and desires to hurt them where it hurt most. How could one, even remotely, find a guy like this sympatico baffles me - the glib charm offensives when Jobs needed other people's money or ideas, or simply wanted to ingratiate himself, were a clear danger signal. The &#34;reality distortion field&#34; we hear about throughout the book is essentially a synonym for &#34;lying&#34; and mind control.<br /><br />Jobs' zen was more an affected show than the real thing, he clearly did not get anything at all beyond the superficial aesthetics. I was more intrigued by the strange diets, which must have kept him in a perpetual altered state. Reminded me of indigenous tribes, where &#34;shamans&#34; etc use this very method to stay on their toes in the face of danger. Some examples would be the  Jivaro (who subsist on tobacco juice), Mekeo &#34;men of sorrow&#34; who eat almost nothing to keep their 'powers', the Kogi, fasting Native Americans etc. Curious, that.<br /><br />The best thing that happened to Jobs was to be fired from Apple and to get married to a woman who would stand by his side despite the idiosyncrasies. This , one gets the sense, is where things started to shift. Suddenly he meets and has to deal with, guys with egos bigger than his own - Eisner, Katzenberg, Ellison. And pulls off, with Pixar, one of the more amazing feats in the media business. Here, unfortunately, is where the detailed psychological portrait painted by I. starts to dim and we get to hear more about the business deals; the story gets weaker the more it moves towards the present day...  in contrast to the gripping, detailed portraits of the early Apple II-Mac days, I. blithely zips through the iGadgets without letting us into the picture. I guess this may be because the real work (microprocessor chips etc) was actually created by other people whereas Jobs was fixated on the design process.<br /><br />The older Jobs gets, the more he starts to resemble a human being. He still rips people off, sells his employees' ideas as his own etc...  but his priorities start to shift. He is still unable, despite all the billions, to do a grand gesture that would come even remotely close to commitments and effort made by Buffet and Gates to better the condition of his fellow man - when it comes to money Jobs is basically a bazaar merchant. Psychologically, he is never far away from Beirut - his first impulse is always to cheat those without power to hit back and he does it just for the sake of it. Jobs is different from, say, Ellison in that he does not seem to be motivated by greed for the sake of money - his refusal to properly compensate the people who did the real work behind the glamorous exterior seems rather an obvious of psychopathology that was never resolved and disconnected the men from other human beings. Jobs was fine with the Orwellian Foxconn factories; paid minimum wage to Apple store employees who individually sold equipment worth millions while he, Steve, sat on tens of $ billions of cash in the bank. Real weirdness here.<br /><br />As he fights cancer, Jobs  starts to contemplate improving education and even chides Murdoch about the destruction that Fox &#34;news&#34; daily wreaks upon this country. That's quite an evolution for the apolitical guy who always saw himself first. But - alas - all it was, was words.<br /><br />In summary, this is a good book. At its best, the story reminded me of the Electric Koolaid Acid Test; we hear about LSD and even get to meet Dylan and Baez (Jobs' girlfriend for a time). The book slowly loses steam, as the author was clearly under some time pressure there. Yet it is well worth reading - to see how the Silicon Valley and VC operate, to see how the IP game is played, to get an insight into some of the key players in (tech) history, and to crawl under the skin of a cantankerous, selfish, intuitive, brilliant, one-of-a-kind person who created beautiful things by using his gut, and guts. He would have hated it and he would have admired it.wreaks upon this country. That's quite an evolution for the apolitical guy who always saw himself first. But - alas - all it was, was words.

B00000099Y|1.0|If you went back into the late 90's/early 00's and asked me what my favorite bands were, I would have gladly answered Tool and Rage Against the Machine.  Back then, I thought both bands were such musically-brilliant, insightful bands because of the fact that they were marketed as bands that were heavy metal yet were insightful and thought-provoking, and being the gullable kid I was due to my lack of knowledge of underground music at the time, I ate them both up like hotcakes.  For the last seven years or so, I've been neck-deep in underground metal and industrial bands, and to say that I've burned my bridges to Tool and RATM would be an understatement.  Rather, it would be more appropriate to say that I hijacked a TOS-1 Buratino flamethrower tank and not only decimated said bridges with the tank's massive thermobaric rocket payload, but also decimated any nearby engineering firms that could have rebuilt those bridges to said alt-metal bands. Okay, enough of my rambling, on to reviewing Tool's \\"Aenima.\\"<br /><br />Listening to this album as an adult, I can't help but get infuriated by it.  This album infuriates me because aside from sounding so drab for being a \\"heavy\\" rock band, it totally reeks of dishonesty for the fact that it's marketed as an intelligent slab of music yet it tightly-clings to such juvenille aesthetics that don't gel at all with aesthetics that are supposed to be \\"higher class.\\"  Even if the juvenille lyrics in some songs are supposed to be ironic humor, it didn't work because I'm not laughing.<br /><br />MUSICIANS/MUSICIANSHIP<br /><br />While many of the musicians here have some instrumental talent by themselves, they don't win much points from me because they don't craft much music on this album that I actually like.<br /><br />Maynard James Keenan is an extremely overrated singer.  His vocalwork is one of the main reasons why I hate this album, since his vocals usually are either really bad \\"anguished\\" singing or pseudo-aggressive yelling, in which both styles would be right at home with your run-of-the-mill 90's nu-metal (or alternative metal for those who demand euphamisms) or Nine Inch Nails album (yuck).<br /><br />His songwriting isn't impressive at all, either.  So much of his lyrics on this album are like what you'd read from an angry high schooler's notebook who's in an introductory philosophy class, so it's like a mix of bad, angsty poetry and pseudo-intellectual ramblings.  Some songs like \\"Fourty Six and Two\\" and \\"Third Eye\\" exemplify the pseudo-intellectual lyrics, while songs like \\"Hooker With a Penis\\" (brilliant song title) have lyrics as if they were yanked straight out of an angry 15 year-old's mouth.<br /><br />Adam Jones is a guitarist that has skill (though is inferior to the likes of Chuck Schuldiner and Ron Jarzombek), but a lot of what he's made on this album is really flat and uninspired.  The only song where any of his riffs and solos sound like there's some energy in them are in \\"Third Eye,\\" while it seems like the rest are just grunge/nu-metal riffs played in an \\"artsy\\" manner or flat, simplified progressive rock riffs with an occasional polyrhythm.  Most of the solos aren't that good, either, since so many of them sound like half-baked, goofy \\"feedback\\" solos you'd hear from Tom Morello (another painfully overrated guitarist).<br /><br />Justin Chancellor's bass is interesting in areas, though nothing that really grabbed my attention.  If it counts for anything, at least his bass is more audible in this album than most rock albums out there.<br /><br />Danny Carey is a drummer that's been showered with tons of praise.  Now he is a skilled drummer, but skill with an instrument doesn't mean they automatically can make interesting songs.  True, in a lot of the songs on this album, Carey does some neat, technical stuff with his skins, but they can't save the songs for the fact that so many of them are either boring or downright irritating.<br /><br />SONGS<br /><br />The only songon this album I'd say is promising is \\"Third Eye.\\"  In fact, I'd say that for the most part, it shows that when pressed, Tool's rhythm section can come up with dynamic, interesting music (especially since this one clocks in at 14 minutes).  However, it gets ruined with Maynard's lousy vocalwork, especially when he screams out \\"Prying open my third eye!!\\".<br /><br />The \\"hit\\" songs like \\"Stinkfist\\" and \\"Aenima\\" are examples of the grunge/nu-metal songs with an \\"artsy\\" glaze applied to them, and boy do they sound annoying. They honestly don't sound much different (or much better) than the typical grunge/nu-metal gunk infesting the mainstream at the time this album came out.<br /><br />Other songs like \\"Push1t\\" and \\"Eulogy\\" are examples of trying-too-hard-yet-flat progressive-rock with the occasional \\"heavy\\" moments on this album, and when I'm not chuckling at Maynard's attempts to come off as a deep thinker, I'm usually wallowing in boredom over how bloodless most of them feel.<br /><br />There's filler tracks like \\"Message to Harry Manback,\\" \\"Intermission,\\" and \\"Die Eeir Von Satan\\" that add next to nothing in terms of musical quality, in that they only pad out the running length of the album.<br /><br />PRODUCTION<br /><br />The production quality on this album isn't bad, since all the vocals, guitars, bass, and drums come in rather clear.  However, like with all music, good sound quality can't save lousy music.<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br /><br />Despite all the heavy marketing and hype from the likes of MTV and Tool fans, this album is NOT a progressive metal masterpiece that will stretch your mind and change your life.<br /><br />If you're looking for some actual metal albums that have brilliant musicianship, innovative ideas, creativity, or thoughtful lyrics (or a combination of any), I strongly suggest you invest your time and money on these albums instead (and yes, I've listened to and own all of these):<br /><br />Death: \\"Human\\"<br />Cynic:  \\"Focus\\"<br />Pestilence:  \\"Spheres\\"<br />Phantasmagory:  \\"Odd Sounds\\"<br /> Atheist:  \\"Piece of Time\\"<br /> Spastic Ink:  \\"Ink Complete\\"<br />Blotted Science:  \\"The Machinations of Dementia\\"<br /> Gordian Knot:  \\"S/T\\"<br /> Bunkur:  \\"Bludgeon\\"<br /> Neurosis:  \\"Souls at Zero\\"<br /> Godflesh:  \\"Pure\\"<br /> Blut Aus Nord:  \\"MoRT\\"<br /> Pan.Thy.Monium:  \\"Khaooohs\\"<br /> Meshuggah:  \\"Destroy Erase Improve\\"<br /><br />Don't be surprised that if you get engrossed in any of the above albums and own a copy of Tool's \\"Aenima,\\" that you find yourself getting rid of said Tool album.on this album I'd say is promising is \\"Third Eye.\\"  In fact, I'd say that for the most part, it shows that when pressed, Tool's rhythm section can come up with dynamic, interesting music (especially since this one clocks in at 14 minutes).

0060558121|5.0|A teacher recommended this to me and made it out to be literary genius. She went on about how it was so /amazing/ because of how Gaiman points out the spiritual flaws of Americans. So, naturally, I came in expecting this mind blowing, epiphany causing masterpiece.<br /><br />All Gaiman does is point out the obvious: Americans are not very spiritual people. We create this idea of a god or gods to serve some kind of purpose, then when our purposes change we leave the gods behind and find new ones. Then he says, \\"Well wait. Is it the people, or is it that the land just can't hold the gods?\\" It wasn't really that mind blowing or life changing. I just sort of nodded my head and read on.<br /><br />That's not to say this book isn't great. I still loved it.<br /><br />Gaiman's writing is practically dripping with sarcasm and dark humor, and if you can pick up on that and read it with a grain of salt, you can see the brilliance behind it all. The book is very episodeish, and gets very topsy turvy in places, but you just need to embrace the weirdness and have fun while he takes you through this strange cross county god hunt.<br /><br />Speaking of the gods, Gaiman's twist on mythology is amusing, and makes the characters interesting. Shadow is also entertaining, merely because of the nonchalant way he handles everything.<br /><br />In the end, the book wasn't what I thought it would be, but it was still far from disappointing.<br /><br />If all Gaiman's books are written like this, I may just have a new favorite author.

B0073O8BOS|5.0|Something has been missing all these years and its Band Of Skulls. Having enjoyed a few tracks from their debut release Baby Darling Doll Face Honey, I heavily underestimated what this English band would become. Now on my third listen of the day, and sixth overall, I can't stay away from this recording. The first three tracks have hooks that brand themselves in your head, so stimulating, my seven-month old was keeping up with the hooks.<br /><br />Some of the most prestine moments of this release are the breaks, bridges and cuts. So phenomenal, track two, \\"Bruises\\", has an exquisitely sharp and hard edge. \\"Lay My Head Down\\" slices up a warm slice of their sound and feeds it gently. \\"The Devil Takes Care Of His Own\\" has a groove-laden funk and grunge about it. Fits well for those fans of White Stripes. Then of course, there's the lead single. That signature BOS confidence and energy peels through each bar. \\"Sweet-Sour/Sour by the minute/But you're sweeter by the hour\\". Top it off with a full session of five-star guitar solo mirroring that of Zep or Floyd. \\"You're Not Pretty But You Got It Goin' On\\" has this massive bees buzzing backbone and a near Muse/Radiohead feel as the song nears it's finality.<br /><br />Songs like \\"Navigate\\" nail down the softer-side of Band Of Skulls. At the same time, very up-tempo, melodramatic, nearly Americana-like Emma Richardson at a sultry pace. \\"Hometowns\\" picks up where \\"Navigate\\" left off, but \\"Lies\\" revisits the funk of \\"Sweet Sour\\", the lead single. Quite truthfully, what surprised me is just how clean and tactfully slow these cats can be. A carefulness that is not common, nearly like a Radiohead-type patience in the closer \\"Close to Nowhere\\".<br /><br />Punk-flavor, progressive tempo's and a consistent song structure flowing from melodic Acoustica to grungy Metal in clean production. To call the last BOS album diverse, is an understatement. To say the Band Of Skulls have matured onto an unbeaten path of hybrid rock is now a foregone conclusion. This is the first 5 out of 5 that I've handed out in quite some time. Simply put, I am refreshed.... And I want everyone else to feel the same. My only regret, is not having waited longer to write this review, because I'm certain I'll be back with more \\"Wanderluster\\".one conclusion.

B006T3RM08|5.0|I had purchased the \\"Magic Wand\\" for my computer at work and was happy with how it connected my keyboard to my trackpad.  I was about to buy another one for my home computer and this product was suggested to me so I bought it instead.  It was a little tight snapping the two devices in but once I had them in right, it worked great.  At first it was wobbly and then I realized they were not completely snapped in.  The buttons on the trackpad work well (I noticed others had problems).  Perhaps they didn't have them seated correctly into the clique.  This looks really nice and sleek and the advantage over the \\"magic wand\\" is that you can hold this clique with the keyboard and trackpad in your lap and have full functionality with the trackpad buttons.  I think it is a great design!

1594744769|4.0|Girls who can levitate, invisible boys, a girl with the ability to summon fire in her hands or a boy that has bees living in his mouth.  These are the fantastical stories and photographs Jacob's grandfather shares with him from the time he's very young. Most people, including Jacob, think they're just that - stories illustrated by doctored and altered photographs.  But Jacob reconsiders when he finds his grandfather dying in a forest behind his house and spies the hideous monster who killed him hiding in the trees.  Jacob travels to a small island called Cairnholm where his grandfather grew up in a children's home searching for answers to his grandfather's death.  It's on this island, hidden in the bogs and swamps, that he finds information not only about his grandfather, but about himself as well.<br /><br />Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children was truly different from other teen paranormal fiction out there, and I don't want to ruin any part of it, which is why I left my synopsis so vague.  The novel is told in first person from Jacob's point of view and I have to say, being privy to Jacob's inner monologue is really entertaining.  He's snarky and intelligent and brave, and I loved seeing this world through his eyes.  I also liked the advantage of experiencing a blossoming romance through the heart of a teenage boy, since many of the paranormal books tell romantic stories from a girl's point of view.  It was refreshing to get a guy's perspective on love for a change.<br /><br />What also made the book really intriguing and unique was the inclusion of actual authentic vintage photographs.  There are pictures strewn throughout of photos with a very circus-like feel of a boy lifting an enormous boulder, a man with a mouth on the back of his head, a contortionist, and a boy with the body of a dog.  I was absolutely amazed that these came from actual collectors who had found many of the photographs from garage and antique sales, and are, with the exception of some minor enhancements, undoctored.  They gave a very unique flavor to the book, and we are allowed to experience the same conflict as the main character as to whether or not we can believe the photographs as evidence of his grandfather's stories.<br /><br />Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children has a little bit of something for everyone - mystery, romance, adventure, action - all with a unique storyline and perspective.  It's worth delving into if you need to spice up your reading list with something out of the ordinary.<br /><br />from blog Adults Reading YA on Blogger

It was even better the second time around. Enzo is such a beautiful character- a dog who is sure he will be reincarnated as a human next lifetime, and he is learning all he can to insure that. I can't recommend it highly enough. You won't be sorry if you buy the audio version or read the book.

B006CC0YB0|5.0|This is the best Mark Lanegan album since Whiskey for the Holy Ghost! I don't need to add to the cacophany of praise, so let me just say you will not regret this purchase, even if you were not thrilled with Scraps or Field Songs or Bubblegum, as I wasn't. I will buy anything he puts out, but I have not truly loved an album like this by any artist, let alone Lanegan, in years. My only hope is that I don't ruin it for myself by playing it too many times in a row. Fortunately I can mix it up a bit with two other recent Lanegan albums I purchased at the same time[[ASIN:B000E6GBVW Ballad of the Broken Seas]]: Ballad of the Broken Seas, with Isobell Campbell, which I discovered on Pandora via my Screaming Trees radio station, and a new Screaming Trees album--yes, new (2011 release)!--called Last Words: The Final Recordings.[[ASIN:B005LF86C8 Last Words:  The Final Recordings]]

B004XGN8W4|5.0|I bought the G155 so that my boys could play video games on our cross country trip (about 17 hours each way).  Using this along with a power inverter and an xbox in our van, the boys stayed entertained for most of the trip (though there were a few arguments about what to play).<br /><br />The screen is excellent.  Halo 3 looks awesome on it.  We also watched a few movies like Avatar and we were not disappointed in the visuals.  The sound seemed okay.  For some reason they had to have the volume up to 100 with the headphones in and even at that level it could at times be hard to hear.  It could be the cheap headphones we bought and not the G155.<br /><br />It is easy to set up and go.  Now that we are back home from our trip, it has even freed up my living room big screen because the boys now prefer to play on the G155.  No complaints here and overall this is a great little device that is perfect for traveling.
B007UXTG8M|5.0|We are all a bit nutty in our own way.  Michael Fassbender's character lives the life that many modern men would think is spectacular.  He is free from emotional attachments.  He has no wife, nor does he want one.  This is the story of a man who leads a solitary existence in New York City.  He should be very, very happy.  He's good looking, has a high paying job, and a nice apartment.  His free time and work time is mainly spent watching pornography on the internet, having prostitutes over, and chasing down women in bars.  He is very good at meeting and seducing women, but it usually doesn't go beyond a tryst in an alleyway.  It becomes painfully obvious that he has a sexual addiction.<br /><br />His sister, who is a very flawed character in her own way, comes to stay with him because she has nowhere else to go.  She's an aspiring singer.  Fassbender's character loves his sister, but cannot communicate with her and blames her for infringing upon his sterile, emotionless existence.  Watching this man, is like watching a tiger in a cage.  He is very intense, but also trapped in the same patterns.  He wants desperately to connect with his sister, but only ends up raging on her.  In a sense, he sees in his sister all of the women he has used and tossed away, because during the course of the film it is apparent that she has been used by men and tossed by the wayside.  He sees the effect this has on her, but never talks to her about it.  He is a perfect individual in his own eyes.  From the outside looking in, you see that he is terribly lonely, depressed, speeding towards some sort of doom.  The only time he feels an emotional connection with a woman, he cannot perform sexually.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to men especially, who think that womanizing is a fine way to spend your time.  It has forced me to think about my own behaviors.  Anything that makes you think like that, without preaching or telling a morality tale in an obvious manner, constitutes art.
0547569653|5.0|It may be a little early to be writing a review since I am only a quarter of the way through, but Scott Jurek has already had a huge impact on me as a new runner. I was convinced that I needed to embrace the barefoot running style in order to prevent injuries over the long term and at 60 years old, my out-of-shape lower legs were already starting to scream. Scott's perspective that \\"Beginners run ... Out-of-shape people run ... And for them forefoot striking might increase the risk of tendonitis or other soft tissue injury\\" turned out to be just the advice I needed. As a result, I changed my running style and bought some shoes that were better for the condition I am in now. (Haven't given up the barefoot idea - maybe next year!) The recipes Scott includes are also amazing! My husband loves the Apple Cinnamon granola [...]) and now agrees that maybe going vegetarian 2 or 3 days a week is not a bad idea! Best of all, Scott writes about himself with a humility and a sense of story that makes this a great read! I am savoring every page.

Although you do not need to purchase anything, it seems like it would make the game better, I did not buy anything as I am willing to pay a one time fee for a game but not constant. payments for game play.  Also frustrated with the need to post on Facebook to get some goals off list. You should be able to deactivate goals you do not want to do due to not wanting to share or post on FB or purchse game tokens.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Season 2 takes off where season 1 ends and just as you would expect the Season 2 gets even more intense!.<br />This TV series has got a lot of attention and praise from everyone.

One of the very best! I hate to give out details and spoil the viewing pleasure of others but I can assure you that there is good chemistry!, Good Acting, Good Sound effects, Technically perfect piece of work! - Get the whole series!

B006LQQ1GE|4.0|Like most people, I came across this album via \\"Somebody\\" which I saw on YouTube as performed by a different group.  Fortunately, I have a friend who turned me on to the best tracks from MAKING MIRRORS and LIKE DRAWING BLOOD and I've been hooked ever since.<br /><br />The things that some music critics have been dissing are the very things that I love about this album: nary two tracks have the same style, and he has a great sense of humor.  On DRAWING BLOOD it was on \\"Thanks For Your Time,\\" a great number about telephone operators and on this one it's \\"State of the Art,\\" an obviously (well, not to some critics) sarcastic joke about an old-timey organ synthesizer and the nuclear family that owns it.<br /><br />And really, I don't have to say anything about it, but \\"Somebody\\" is a genius song.  Super annoying by now, but genius.<br /><br />But it's the throwback Motown track \\"I Feel Better,\\" the 80's Wham!-like \\"In Your Light,\\" the Sting-evoking \\"Eyes Wide Open,\\" uber-catchy \\"Save Me\\" and creep-tastic \\"Don't Worry\\" (which somebody really has to remix using as much of the final beat section as possible) that really make this album.<br /><br />My only complaint is that MAKING MIRRORS is such a recent album that I'll probably have to wait another two years or so before Gotye releases anything else.<br /><br />Highly suggested listening.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|This TV series amazes me on every single episode I just cannot stop watching. There is always a dark surprise in every move. Complex relationships and very well connected and laid out plots. Acting is superb. Love the time lapses, Love the flash forwards, Flash Backwards. As experienced so far in these series nothing can be ignored as everything is connected to something or the other later in the show. Technically perfect! Excellent Screenplay, Excellent Direction, Excellence is all the areas! Kudos to cast and crew. Superb Show!<br /><br />Full Five Stars! for Season 3 as well.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|Breaking Bad TV series is an outstanding piece of work from the cast and crew. Kudos to the director for making this one of the very best TV series that I have ever watched in my life. I rarely praise any TV drama but honestly this TV series is one of the most addicting series ever. The work is technically perfect! Everything is well done from acting to sound effects to storytelling. There is something for everyone in the household to watch and enjoy.<br /><br />Warning! After watching this series, you will find most other popular TV series dull and boring! I am confident that within less than 10 mins into the season 1 episode 1 show you will get addicted and cannot stop watching the series.<br /><br />Excellent! 5 Stars!

0345803485|1.0|With everyone talking about this book, I decided to pick it up from Amazon and read it.  After finishing the entire series, I was left wondering what is wrong with this world.  These books are without the doubt some of the worst written books I've ever read in my life, and that's saying a lot because I've read some really terrible stuff.<br /><br />I hope that the author is thanking the powers that be every single day that she's hit a gold mine, because it's really not deserved.  The characters are extremely one dimensional, the plot wanders without any real pay off at the end, the scenes aren't set very well and, at the end, I'm wondering why this story even exists, other than to repeat the same sex scene over and over again.  The only area she did succeed was in creating truly unlikable characters.  She also introduces various characters that don't have any point in existing.  You keep expecting something to happen with them, but it never does.<br /><br />It's just not right that these books are selling millions upon millions of copies while the work of legitimately talented writers is going unnoticed.
B0071T5PN0|5.0|Like everyone else, I was skeptical when I heard of this \\"reunion.\\"  I must say, I was pleasantly surprised.  Dave's voice and wit are intact and instruments sound as good as ever.  Thankfully the production is much better than the Sammy years as Eddie has cut WAY back on the chorus and other effects which really made him sound horrible.  Having said all of that, the real stroke of genius was going back and rebooting the unused songs from the 70's as that is what everyone wanted...simply cock-rock akin to \\"Van Halen I.\\"  Even \\"Tattoo\\" starts to grow on you if you listen to it enough.  Worth buying.
0345803493|1.0|I read these after hearing about them nonstop.  Man, am I irritated I wasted my time and money.  These are, without a doubt, the worst books I've ever read in my life, and that's saying quite a bit.  The author is, without exaggeration, the worst writer I've ever read.  I am completely boggled that these books have become the phenomenon that they have and it seriously makes me worry about the state of this world.  There are far more talented writers out there that deserve this sort of recognition but will never get it because they don't blatantly pander to the desperate housewives sector.<br /><br />There is no plot, there is no character development and there is no purpose to these books.  The author only succeeds in writing characters that are so thoroughly unlikable that you actually wish harm on them.  Complete garbage.  I wish I could get my time and money back!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Well, all the bad rap that this book(s) has received is indeed making me upset.  Firstly, most persons who read the Twilight are simply using it to determine its worth (thank God I did not read it and will not read it). Sure the book had some low points, but even the most interesting things suffer from this.  I read all three books and I am satisfied to the hilt and biting my lips in anticipation of seeing the movie.  Secondly, if you are an \\"editor\\", perhaps your skills will not allow you to read casually and let bad grammar and typos be (ignored)- read the book and stop grading it.  The story centres around an obviously naive, unexposed, young woman, why did you all expect more out of her?  Ana was a delight to read about as she acted her age, thank God, and she was allowed to mature and be woman.  Christian is rich, he has people who work for him and obviously they did a fine job, therefore, he had loads a time to give to his new found life, why is it so strange that he had so much time for his young, inexperienced and obviously intriguing lover turned wife?  Fantasy always makes for good reading and I can bet that some of you are being plain old hypocrites that the book did not make you flush at some point. The writer is British and I can bet that most of the criticisms are coming from Americans - stop it, it is not always about you guys.  Waiting to watch the movie and to continue to watch E.L. James' sales grow.

B002RHL8DC|1.0|Worst Stargate show ever! I had mixed feelings about the fact that it got a second season. I was glad to know it was being canceled, but sad to hear that they were wasting their money on such a poor show. But that is what you get when Sci-Fi becomes Syfy.<br /><br />After 10 amazing seasons of SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis that ended before its time (only 5 seasons), I had high hopes for this series. By episode 2 I was disappointed, but thought \\"maybe it will get better.\\" It didn't. To much WB channel like drama and not enough of the excitement that made Stargate such a great franchise. To top that off, they tried to shoot this like Battle Star Galactica (which I didn't like).<br /><br />SG:U was a sad ending to a fantastic franchise. I wish MGM and Syfy had never made this show.

B007UQ5Z1G|2.0|Well, unfortunately this album is ALL filler.  I really like probably about half of LP's songs, but none of them are in Living Things.  This album really feels like they are just going through the motions now.  I read an article about this album that talked about the producer mentioning that the band was putting these songs together at a much faster rate than previous albums.  It shows.  It feels a bit rushed.  I hope LP can pull it together for their next batch of songs.

B007V508CC|3.0|The irony of titling their new album \\"Overexposed\\" must have been lost on Adam Levine and Maroon 5. The album is overproduced, over-compressed and over-just-about-everything. Like so many bands in the current pop zeitgeist, they decided that they needed to conform to current popular production memes, which means having a guest rapper-of-the-moment (Wiz Khalifa, adding bonus profanities to \\"Payphone\\"), auto-tune, writer/producers of the now (Max Martin, Ryan Tedder) and multiple other steps that rob the band of any of their previous individual qualities. Take Adam out of the equation, and this would be another generic, over-compressed/produced pop-album.<br /><br />The saving grace is Adam, who's white-boy soul is on a par with Daryl Hall at this point. Given the material he has to work with, he milks every hook and croon he can. Good numbers like \\"Lucky Strike,\\" \\"Lady Killer\\" and even the obscenity laced \\"Payphone\\" stick like rubber cement. I'll make a quick point to say that I'm not a prude, but for a band that seemingly prides itself on their pop craftsmanship, the swearing in \\"Payphone\\" and \\"Tickets\\" just seems more gratuitous than effective, like the band has to prove how hard they are. But when you're capable of making really good light funk that hits its groove like \\"Fortune Teller\\" and \\"Doin' Dirt,\\" you don't need to prove you're anything but a great pop band.<br /><br />Which is what, ultimately, Maroon 5 is. \\"Overexposed\\" hits all its marks seemingly without effort, with craftsmanship that most any other band would sell their bubblegum machines for. Adam's unique voice gives the band enough identity to cut through the generic sounding production here, and when they horn-pump Prince's slinky \\"Kiss\\" (a bonus track on the deluxe version), they demonstrate that they're above the cookie-cutter sound that plagues this album.
0811875040|4.0|This is such a great book with wonderful recipes. I have made several items from it and they have all come out perfect! The aesthetics of the book are also great and it makes a perfect gift!

B007VTVGAQ|5.0|If you LOVED Extraordinary Machine and consider it one of the best albums in recent memory, you might want to skip this record. This record has no polish, no hip-hop beats, no fun/silly/dancy hooks, and almost nothing light-hearted. Almost.<br /><br />Alternatively, if you're a fan of Janis Joplin, Animal Collective, and more complicated - and yes, more difficult - art, then this is your dream come true.<br /><br />I fall in the latter camp.<br /><br />This album is WAY more art than luster. It's more honest that way.<br /><br />Upon the first listen, I was slightly put off by the transition between what one might initially consider \\"cute\\" and \\"interesting\\" in the opening track \\"Every Single Night\\" (which recalls 2005's \\"Extraordinary Machine\\") and \\"Daredevil,\\" a song which seems totally unpredictable and wild by contrast. The percussion, including the percussive piano chords, are driving and maddening! Her vocal performance is top-notch, and when she gets to the jazzy, Janis-esque bridge, you're having a \\"wow\\" moment. It may take a few spins, this isn't the kind of song (or album!) that's immediately gratifying for everybody. This song is indicative of the album as a whole in that it's challenging, rewarding, off-putting, and gripping all at the same time.<br /><br />\\"Valentine\\" is a welcome respite from the madness of the second track, reminiscent of Fiona's earlier albums, especially When The Pawn.... The stand-up bass is positively delicious. She injects some humor and sweetness into a rather melancholy song. It feels like an instant classic.<br /><br />The next song \\"Jonathan\\" brings us back into challenging territory. It begins with extremely unpleasant sounds that remind me of Nine Inch Nails. Very industrial, mechanical sounds. It's a meandering piece, and the conflict of the relationship is stunningly apparent in the music, in the lyrics, in the vocals. It's actually quite a feat. I've heard complaints that this song runs too long, which is fair, but beingthat this song is about an awkward, bumpy train ride, lasting too long in discomfort is kind of the point.<br /><br />I had to revisit the next track, \\"Left Alone,\\" a few times to believe it. In fact, I still can't believe it. It's an unambiguously ugly, mean, self-loathing, self-pitying cluster-mess! She verges on so much musical potential - you think for a moment she might take you there, to some place soaring and heavenly. But her voice taunts. It contorts. She starts groaning and squealing sometimes in the same word. It's very jarring. Again Fiona has put a very uncomfortable emotion into songform. Absolutely brilliant. Has to be heard to be believed. Multiple times. \\"My ills are reticulate, my woes are granular/The ants weigh more than the eleph-ants.\\" No one is making music like this nowadays folks, NO ONE.<br /><br />\\"Werewolf\\" is the \\"Paper Bag\\" (from 1999's When The Pawn...) of The Idler Wheel.... It's plaintive and pretty. Rare on this record. It's reminiscent of older music, Kurt Weill? Carole King? Probably not. The song is gorgeous heard out of the context of the album, but it shines particularly brightly among the other songs. It's so gentle, so humble. It's another respite after the density and difficulty of the last song. A good thing too, because the next song, \\"Periphery\\" is not an easy listen. Even in a simple and gorgeous tune, Fiona manages to have some fun: at one point, a banjo makes a cameo for 4 notes, and then bows out. Another fantastic detail to this song is the sample from the playground. It somehow captures nostalgia, innocence, sadness, happiness and terror all together. I love her spontaneity on this record, it is beyond refreshing. \\"Nothing wrong when/a song ends in a minor key.\\" You can say that again, Fi. Your entire album is in a minor key.<br /><br />\\"Periphery\\" is discordant and unpleasant. Deliberately. It opens up with ripping sounds. Again, Apple hints at harmony once in a while, with backup vocals popping up right in the middle of the song for a few bars, sounding almost - almost! - harmonious. But then the piano goes bonkers and she sings \\"I don't appreciate/people who/don't appreciate...You let me down/I don't even like you anymore at all!\\" Absolutely bizarrely delicious. And then it sounds like she's ripping up something again. I heard a pillow was one of the instruments in the liner notes, and this could easily be a pillow getting shredded and it's easy to imagine feathers floating around when the song ends.<br /><br />The next song snuck up on me. It's a real stunner. \\"Regret\\" starts out with mechanical beats, like an unhappy machine with missing pieces. Again: immediate tension. The piano is also displaying a longing: chord. pause. chord. pause. chord. pause. After being so off-kilter in \\"Periphery,\\" \\"Regret\\" feels measured and sure-footed, even when she sings the ridiculous/hilarious highlight lyric: \\"I ran out of white doves' feathers/to soak up the hot piss that comes from your mouth/every time you address me.\\"<br /><br />But finally, it's on \\"Anything We Want\\" that Fiona finally reveals her secret garden. The toys are all in full effect, bangs and taps and clings and clangs, with Fiona's grounding piano leading the way. In the middle there's a sort-of crescendo chord change that seems to finally peel back the ivies and let the sun shine in on you (and her). It's a unique and wonderful listening experience.<br /><br />The album closer, \\"Hot Knife\\" is indeed hot and sharp, a perfect upbeat finish that helps alleviate some of the emotional exhaustion one may feel at the end of such laundry airing. It's infectious and warm and yummy the way \\"The First Taste\\" (on 1996's Tidal) was, except in a much more nuanced execution. \\"You can relax around me.\\"<br /><br />It's easy to think The Idler Wheel... is almost under-produced, until you realize that the vocals are well-layered and the sampling is perfect - and then you realize that these complex and difficult emotions are perfectly framed by this production. It's a strange sound taken as a whole, but a sound Fiona is comfortable with. Not that she didn't previously have full artistic control over her music, but she was kind of wandering around looking for a sound on her first 3 records - and that was a beautiful and wonderful journey to follow her on - but THIS is how Fiona Apple wants to sound. This is an artist at her peak, honestly showcasing her talents, her toys, her thoughts, her turmoil, her artwork, her ideas.<br /><br />And it's astounding, nothing less.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|First, I want to point out that the 4 stars I give this album represent my view of its standing in comparison to other Rush albums, not how good I think it is in general.  Since, in 40+ years Rush hasn't put out a bad album, or even a bad song, the 4 stars here would surpass mostg other album's 5 stars.  I would also like to point out that I am not a rabid Rush fan.  If you ARE a rabid, or perhaps even a moderately afflicted, Rush fan, you may not, initially, be suitably impressed.  You mostly likely will not feel let down, but you may not be inclined to sing its praises, either.  BUT, give it time.  The reason a rabid Rush fan may not fully embrace the album initially is the same reason non Rush fans, or non rabid Rush fans will enjoy it more than other Rush albums:  It sounds more basic than anything Rush has previously done, although that's kind of like saying the new Ferrari isn't as fast as the previous version.  On this album, the songs are not of epic length, the time changes and polyphonic rhythms of Neil's drumming, the pedal work of Alex's playing and the frenetic lead-like bass playing of Geddy are not so in your face as earlier Rush albums.  So, if you give this ablum a once-through or a casual listen, you may find it less inspired than what you would expect from Rush.  If that's the case, don't stop there. Listen again and again. Each listen reveals a greater complexity, a greater maturity, than the last listen.  Once you do that, you will realize it is infused with all the elements that make Rush great.  This isn't pop music, after all. It demands your attention and will reward you nicely for your efforts.  One other point:  Most reviews refer to the album as a concept album.  Alex, however, has reportedly been adamant in insisting it isn't.  The divergence is understandable.  Lyrically, the album clearly is telling a story (in fact, a book will be coming out based on the story on the album).  And, there is some reprises, too.  But, unlike, say Tommy, each song also stands alone. Each song is a story in itself, like each episode of MASH was a complete story, but MASH, taken as a whole, was also the story of the experiences of a medical unit during the Korean War.<br /><br />Okay, one more thing:  Am I the only one who sees a hand carressing a breast on the album artwork?  (A right hand, thumb up, along the bottom part of the picture. The thumb is resting on the nipple.  The shadows along the right side suggest a left breast and outstretched left arm leading off the picture in the upper right corner. The symbols are circling the top of the breast).each song also stands alone.

B004SBX112|5.0|My daughter and husband love Angry Birds. I can not play the game. For some reason everytime I play I make the birds fall to the ground or they shoot way over the intended target. I wish I did know how to play because it is a fun game. This is a really cool game and my daughter could spend hours playing if I let her. Every time my daughter gets to a new level she gets so excited. Each new version that comes out she has to have it! I would recommend this product.
B005LAIGZU|4.0|I bought this as a source of inspiration because I also shoot video with a DSLR. Granted, the production crew had much finer lenses and stabilizing kits than I do, so it's not as if I will be shooting the sequel, but nevertheless it's flatout amazing what the crew accomplished with these cameras. One couldn't tell that no Arri's or RED's were used to shoot this movie. From a reference material perspective, this is a great buy. Yeah, I'm a geek.<br /><br />I took down one star in the rating because the extra features felt dumbed down and forced. The interviews didn't have enough cut scenes and ended up being dry one-on-one chats with the soldiers. Enlightening? Sure. Entertaining? Not for me. The \\"making of\\" didn't go into any technical discussion about the actual production. In fact, all the extras were basically modified versions of trailers and promotions. So boo to the production team for this.<br /><br />The plot is forgettable, and you could certainly find better action movies elsewhere. For a DSLR video shooter like me, it was something that had to be bought as much as a Bruce Willis fan has to buy the Die Hard series or a Harrison Ford fan buying the Indy Jones series.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I was skeptical about this book, even after the first chapter. I thought \\"This is just another teeny bopper melodramatic love story.\\" And in a way, it is. But for some reason I felt my heart going out to these characters. Especially Travis (the bad boy hottie) even when he is the kind of guy every girl should hate! When he cried, I cried. Its a must read! I only wish there were more

1439153663|5.0|I was completely caught up in this story of a white girl, who was essentially raised black and then expected to live in the white world.  The author did a wonderful job conveying the conflict and emotions that Lavinia lived with as a young woman.  Great characters too!
0757302661|4.0|I loved the author's philosophy on fear contributing to pain during labor. She explains a lot about the labor process that you won't learn about in other childbirth classes. After watching videos online with women who used this method, I was really excited to use it, and the relaxation seemed perfect for me because I do tend to suffer from anxiety.<br /><br />As I continued with the book though, I noticed a few things that disappointed me. The worst part is that there are no hypnobirthing instructors in my area, and there is no home study course. Which means that I would have to learn all of the relaxation methods through a book. I have never been good at learning exercises from a book only. A home study course or even just a DVD from the company explaining the techniques would have made the difference between me using the method or not. I also would really like to integrate both a childbirth class and the hypnobirthing class together, and the book alone is simply not enough. Because of this, I am going to order the Hypnobabies home study course, which I have heard good things about as well. If a hypnobirthing home study course was available, I would have bought it. I am disappointed that the company doesn't seem to realize that not all of us live near a hypnobirthing class.<br /><br />The author can be a little preachy at times, and she also does not believe in any kind of pushing, only \\"breathing\\" the baby down. She even claims that pushing is harmful. I don't believe in the hard doctor directed pushing that most women are taught to do, but when a woman feels the natural urge to push, I believe she should follow her body's signals.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the book and the method, but I am going to end up ordering the hypnobabies set. If anyone has any comments on their experiences with either hypnobabies or hypnobirthing, I would love to hear them, since I still have a while to go in my pregnancy and appreciate any advice.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I really didn't think I'd enjoy this game as much as I did! The concept is simple enough --- you pick two elements from a menu, mix them together and produce something new. It starts prosaically with elements like earth, wind, and fire to make steam or lava. But as the game progresses you are rewarded with more esoteric elements, like energy and life; you also get to whip up zombies, wizards, and thunderbirds. Perhaps the niftiest aspect of the gameplay is the quirky little quote that accompanies each discovered element. I definitely would recommend thous game as a charming way to pass an afternoon or just bust out while you're stuck in line.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series of books (a couple are really short stories) are great. Picked up on a whim, and I couldn't stop reading to find out what happened next. If you enjoy sci-fi with good character development and interesting socio-political plot lines, you'll be up all night reading this one.
0718158113|5.0|I watched her series on TV and it was a feast for the eyes!  What she can cook in that tiny Parisian kitchen is amazing.  The recipes are well written, easy to follow and if she can cook them in her little oven and cooktop, then there's no excuse for anyone! Love the originality of the recipes and suggested substitutions of ingredients.  The frites de legumes are a genius alternative to your standard french fries, and much healthier too.  Well worth the purchase, a really beautiful book that you can lose yourself in!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love this game! I very rarely have any problems that anyone else is talking about! Great to pass time in waiting rooms or just relax. I'm pretty much addicted!
1468161660|5.0|This book was amazing could not stop reading it Will and Lake are a great couple everything they go thur just makes them love each other more.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was not sure if i would enjoy a Sci Fi book, since i generally find action packed investigative dramas to be my best reads. Yet i am glad i took the leap! What a book :) Card manages to captivate our imagination and lets us become genius children that experience what it is to be lonely, in despair, isolated yet in control of the situations at hand, This book peaks into the realms of discipline and what it means to \\"do what u must in spite of what u feel\\" i thought i would be bored with futuristic mumbo jumbo... but i am  so glad i was not. Even a genius kid like Ender when it s all said and done is simply a kid,who hero as he maybe has lived life and saved lives through the great deception. One of the best books i have come across.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is fun and additive......but now that I am at level 50 I can't advance which sucks because I like this game.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|This book comes in 4 parts: the novel(la) RedShirts, and the 3 codas.<br /><br />Redshirts is sci-fi comedy in the style of Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams: Sardonic dialogue, zany situations and cleverly written characters pull a ridiculous plot together in a way that's genius rather than camp. Redshirts is insightful comedy, heartstring-tugging tragedy and some pretty awesome action scenes all wrapped up in an obvious love of the sci-fi genre. By itself, the novel is worth the 12 bucks.<br /><br />The codas, however, are what blew my mind.  The first coda continues the tongue in cheek tone of the novel, but contrasts that with a deep sense of worry.  The tone of the 2nd two codas are not humourous.  They are decidely somber and touching.  They left me with questions about my own place in the multiverse.<br /><br />Ultimately, the true question of any novel is \\"Would you recommend it to a friend?\\"  Yes, I already have.  Four times.  If you love sci-fi, or humor, or philosophical dilemmas or bad acting or great writing or finishing a book and immediately wanting to re-read it, BUY THIS ONE!
030758836X|5.0|I am not even finished with this book, and I am startled by how great it is.  And yesterday I was complaining to my husband that this was an unsurprising story - basically the Scott and Lacey Peterson story, really.  But today - I was blindsided and am so completely happy about it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|could load a little faster though. everything else is pretty amazing.  its a game I could play for hours, literally
0470876417|5.0|How can you plan without this book?<br />Ask yourself this question: \\"Do I want to increase the quality of my plannings?\\"<br />If the answer is YES, whatever are the tools you are using now, READ this book and TRY the tools it presents.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Really love it! Works great on my Droid. Easy to play. Makes time go by quickly when waiting for appts. Could play for hours!
076790592X|5.0|Thought provoking<br />Reminds us of what is important in life<br />Inspirational<br />Uplifting<br />Will make you get in touch with old friends
B006L9B6TI|5.0|The Best of the whole Series of \\"The Secret\\"...more into detail on a daily basis, especially on the topic you need help! I Do recommend it!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is a page turner from the very beginning.  But honestly, got a little bored with the story line, too much of the risque and not enough story!  I heard the 2nd book has a much better storyline, looking forward to reading it.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Because of the extreme popularity of these books I was compelled to read them even though the description didn't entice me at all. I must say, I have absolutely no idea what the buzz is all about except that women are finally exploring their hidden sexual desires (which some of us have long since embraced). I found it hard to even find this book remotely sexy with all the references to blushing, gasping, and biting her lips, it became so redundant. Plus who refers to their intimate parts as \\"down there\\" in an attempt to be erotic?? I find myself wondering whether the author has ever even had sex because the grittiness of real sex was left behind and was replaced with a land of endless orgasms. Not to mention how unrealistic this was: a young, handsome, intelligent, talented billionaire (he couldn't just be a millionaire??) finds himself enamored with a blushing, flushing, college aged virgin with no personality? Sounds like something dreamed up by a horny 13 year old girl. And the fact that they get all hot and bothered by exchanging steamy e-mails but she gets mad every time he mentions something controlling even though she knew what he wanted makes NO sense. The way the book ends was supposed to create some epic cliff hanger that enticed the readers to find out, what could he be hiding? I found myself rolling my eyes and throwing it down, glad to finally be done. How is it possible for this book to be so popular with absolutely no plot at all?
B0086700CM|4.0|i think that this app is amazing , but it is so addicting i have like totally played it every day. i love it!!!!!!!
0143106333|5.0|This is a book that can make even the most stern adult become nostalgic.<br /><br />Charlie is a poor kid who loves chocolate but unfortunately, his family can only afford to buy him chocolate once a year on his birthday. On this birthday though something even more exciting has happened because Willy Wonka, owner of the most famous and secretive candy factory in the whole world is offering a prize, whoever finds 1 of 5 golden tickets hidden in their chocolate bars will get the chance to visit the factory which hasn't been open to the public in years.<br /><br />The world of the chocolate factory is quite astounding with little worker men known as Oompa Loompas that sing and dance, a giant chocolate waterfall (untouched by human hands), and tons of candy. Willy Wonka escorts Charlie and several ungrateful little brats around the factory and introduces them to all of his strange candy inventions with several mishaps along the way (that the Oompa Loompas sing about). Best of all, one lucky kid gets an extra special prize at the end.<br /><br />The descriptions of some of these candies was heartbreaking to me as a child because I had to come to terms with the fact that they didn't actually exist. Regardless, this is about as good as a children's book can possibly get and I can't imagine a single child not dreaming of visiting Willy Wonka's themselves someday!
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a great learning game. I reccomend this game for kids learning about building and the economy. It's very productive.
B000001DU5|5.0|I have owned this CD for some time but never fail to enjoy its excellence. Each title melds into the next and the music/melody/lyrics/voices are wonderful, especially Woman in Chains where Oleta Adams assists in taking it over the top! What a finely crafted CD. It will always be considered one of the TOP 50 CDs in my music library. It's very difficult to be original in the music world or anywhere, but Tears for Fears has indeed put out an original piece of work here.
B007WFQZI2|5.0|If you bother to trace my product reviews, they are mostly centered around music-related topics. However, my preference for the analog format is rooted in my long-time obsession with music and especially hard rock and metal. In the late '80s I was a long haired thrasher, and I was introduced to Kreator and other German groups such as Sodom, Assassin, and Destruction through friends and metal magazines. Among my first purchases included \\"Terrible Certainty\\" and Extreme Aggression\\" upon the latter's release in 1989. At that time most of my collection was on CD or cassette as I used my roommate's turntable for the limited vinyl in my collection. I made mix tapes constantly so my Walkman would keep me isolated, and also for the stereo at work. Boy did the waitresses hate my music, they were in fear of me too, sporting \\"Metal Up Your Ass\\" t-shirts and such. Anyhow, Kreator stood out for Mille's coarse vocals, and the sometimes too fast to stay tight tunes. Nevertheless, like many groups at the time (Sacred Reich amongst others), they 'grew' into their musical abilities and in time they became masters of a style that was, until recently, on the fringe of society-- accused of being Satanic, violent, misogynistic, etc... (like rap almost...). To this day their covers follow the devilish imagery of old... but<br /><br />This new album, literally, on vinyl, truly is exceptional. I have it on CD too, pre-ordered it on Amazon, and it struck my fancy immediately with its maturity, at least in the melodic sense, but Kreator is not getting soft with age either. Indeed, they are still kicking butt, and I plan to see them on tour with Accept in LA this coming September. Now for the vinyl review: Because my ears were accustomed to the CD 'tone' if you will, I immediately noticed the fuller sound in all frequencies, top to bottom, and especially the bottom. Furthermore, Mille's vocals are better presented in the mix- center and audible, even at very high volume (as you know already, the only way to listen to thrash). I played both dics (by the way, they are red vinyl with black spatters, not yellow as depicted in the product image. The sleeves are high quality paper, but I still recommend a good wash and using Mofi anti-static sleeves afterward to preserve the originals. Washing also removes the inherent static that nearly all new and used LPs arrive with. I think the only thing that sucks is having to get up and flip the records, but the superior sound is worth the extra output of energy. I think you owe it to yourself to get acquainted with how much better sounds on vinyl. While my original collection is scattered to the winds, I can rebuild it with vinyl versions of the old CDs (whenever possible) and collect new LPs too. Look for the release programs by Back On Black from the UK who reissue 180 gram pressings of legendary hard rock by Motorhead, Dark Angel, UFO, THin Lizzy, and many other gems. In the meantime, I will play this Kreator slab of heavy vinyl for days and weeks to come- naturally, I will take care of my investment. Rock on!!he only way to listen to thrash).

B006AZZPCM|4.0|Works well on the Kindle.  I've not seen any porn ads.  The only negative is that you have to use their green button to view or download--you can't simply click on the video itself.
B0063IH60K|5.0|ENJOYING IT EMENSELY!!!  Very easy to use!  The graphics are great and I have had a lot of fun playing it!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Fun. Just plain Fun. Let me get the one negative out of the way first...Why does every villain have to take over the world? Apart from the overly familiar villain's scheme, everything was flat out fantastic.<br /><br />The characters that had real depth. The truly standout character was the Hulk. In the first 2 Hulk movies, you couldn't wait for Banner to turn into the Hulk. Here, Banner was so well written, empathetic and likable that you felt his fear about turning into the other guy and rooted for him not to turn into the monster. Stark was back to his fun, lovable, egotistical self that made him great in the first one. Black Widow became a real person. You felt Cap's fish out of water-ness. Coulson was just great. Dialog was witty, clever and fun. Lot's of humor, not just humor thrown in. The humor completely fit the characters and the situation. Marvel took it's time and carefully crafted a terrific movie. This wasn't a thrown together cash grab as you would expect a sequel combing several successful franchises.<br /><br />Marvel did this movie right. So Marvel please bring back the writers, cast and crew right down to the grips for Avenger 2, because you made magic, struck gold, bottled lightning with The Avengers.

B00005K424|3.0|The game concept is great as described in the other reviews.  However, the version I received is not metal anywhere, and it is NOT magnetized, making it VERY difficult to play while traveling.  Thus the \\"travel version\\" is a bit of a misnomer, and should probably be called: \\"small, cheap version\\" instead.  I had international house guests who enjoyed our game and so I bought the travel version as a \\"bon voyage\\" gift.  It was only $7 less than the regular version.  If I had known that it was NOT magnetized, I would have paid the extra for the nicer, heavier, regular version. I was disappointed, but there was no time to exchange it for the full version. Later I checked the comments on A. Skinner's review and found one that noted the same problem (not magnetized).  However, that comment is not seen with the other reviews so I decided to write a review to save someone else from the same mistake I made. Really great game, but save yourself some disappointment and order the regular version.

1416955070|5.0|Originally posted on my blog: [...]<br />I have SO many favorite quotes this time over, you guys, I just HAD to share some :D<br /><br />  Simon grinned, \\"You've never heard of Dungeons and Dragons?\\" \\"I've heard of dungeons,\\" Jace said. \\"Also dragons. Although they're mostly extinct.\\" Simon looked disappointed. \\"You've never killed a dragon?\\" \\"He's probably never met a six-foot-tall hot elf-woman in a fur bikini, either,\\" Clary said irritably. \\"Lay off, Simon.\\"<br /><br />  He squinted at her. \\"Do you remember back at the hotel when you promised that if we lived, you'd get dressed up in a nurse's and give me a sponge bath?\\"\\"Actually, I think you misheard\\", Clary said. \\"It was Simon who promised you the sponge bath.\\" Jace looked involuntarily over at Simon, who smiled at him widely. \\"As soon as I'm back on my feet, handsome!\\" \\"I knew we should have left you a rat.\\"<br /><br />  \\"That's why when major badasses greet each other in movies, they donn't say anything, they just nod. The nod means, 'I am a badass, and I recognize that you, too, are a badass.'\\"<br /><br />  \\"Have you fallen in love with the wrong person yet?'<br />  Jace said, \\"Unfortunately, Lady of the Haven, my one true love remains myself.\\"<br />  ...\\"At least,\\" she said, \\"you don't have to worry about rejection, Jace Wayland.\\"<br />  \\"Not necessarily. I turn myself down occasionally, just to keep it interesting.\\"<br /><br />  Don't.\\" Clary raised a warning hand. \\"I'm not really in the mood right now.\\"<br />  \\"That's got to be the first time a girl's ever said that to me,\\" Jace mused.\\"<br /><br />Plot: Quite amazing. Fast-paced, thrilling with enough romance and mystery to keep anyone and everyone in its grip. And what an iron-fast grip it is! You are entranced from page 2 and you don't want to let go for the world. I started reading this the day before my final exams (yes, I know that was the stupidest thing ever) and I just couldn't stop. I finished my tests fast just so I could keep reading. Lol<br /><br />Characters: All of the characters in City of Bones are really well-written and easily lovable. Isabelle is such a strong person and I would personally love to meet her and Alec, well it's awesome Clare gave the gay population some voice! I just wish that Clary (I'm guessing that's a twist on Clare) was a little less dependent on Jace and the others; hopefully she'll learn more by the next book - I'd like to see her as a stronger female lead. My favorite character was definitely Simon. You can see why in my favorite quotes lol. I know you're wondering why I left Jace for last. Well, it's because I don't much care for him. (Don't hit me!) I was really liking him until the end. To be so credulous to blindly throw away all his beliefs just because his \\"father\\" turns out to be alive and well shows how undependable he isI find it slightly disappointing and I pity him. Well, I'm sure he'll have plenty of time to redeem himself in the next few books, but so far, that's how I feel.<br /><br />World: Ah, Clare creates such a crazy yet believable world! She's like Rowling that way (yes, I'm comparing her to Rowling). Both writers have the ability to create amazing worlds that invite you to step right in and make yourself at home.<br /><br />Romanciness: I loved Jace and Clary until...well, if you've read the book you know what I mean and if you haven't...no spoilers for you! I have no doubt that this *ahem obstacle* will turn out to be not true because that just ruins the chances for these two and I kind of doubt any author would do that in the first book. On the other hand, I do NOT like Simon and Clary. To be honest, I feel like that was just thrown in and there's really nothing there. Please, Cassandra, don't turn this into a Twilight-y love triangle! Isn't one person enough for you? And Please please please tell me Alec and Magnus Bane have a chance!! That's something I'm rooting for even more than the others. I know there's probably a huge age difference, but it's not insurmountable right?<br /><br />So overall, I'm just beating myself up for not reading this sooner! City of Ashes, where are you???<br /><br />More About the Series: All you Clare fans probably know more about this than I do, but with some research, I have found that after City of Bones comes City of Ashes, City of Glass and City of Fallen Angels. The 5th book, called 'City of Lost Souls', will be published May 8, 2012 and the last book entitled 'City of Heavenly Fire' comes out Sept 2014. Yeah, you have to gnaw your nails that long, hard-core fans.<br />But not to worry. There is a spin-off series called The Infernal Devices with Clockwork Angel and Clockwork Prince out already, and Clockwork Princess out Sept 2013.<br />Question for you,<br /><br />Recommended for: OMG Everyone!!<br /><br />I borrowed this from my local library to read and post an honest review.er!

B004LWZW42|4.0|It was a pretty good movie. It was worlds better than X-Men: Origins Wolverines, but I don't think it was as good as the first two movies. Also, they created a few plotholes.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert!<br />At the end, Xavier was crippled and into his wheel chair, yet in The Last Stand when he goes to visit Jean as a kid, he's walking.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger Games is fast moving and hard to stop reading. Suzanne Collins not only draws for us a future that seems possible but one that at times also seems likely.
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|Pretend for just a second that the first 3 songs don't exist (unless you're into clubbing music, in which case, you'll really love the first 3 songs). I won't deny that I wanted Demi to pour her emotions into her music and was kind of disappointed when she only really did that with 1 song (For The Love Of A Daughter) but I understand that she had JUST gotten out of treatment so she probably didn't want to talk about it.<br /><br />\\"Together\\" features one of her idols (Jason Derulo). She sings about how she wants for everybody to just be together in harmony 'again'.<br /><br />\\"Lightweight\\" talks about how someone has her heart in their hands and that they can make or break her.<br /><br />\\"Unbroken\\" - The title kind of was kind of misleading to me. I thought it was going to be a song about her struggle and how she's still getting through some things, but it's actually about someone she loves and how she's gonna \\"love them like she's never been broken\\". At first I was kind of disappointed about it, but the more I listened to it, the more I loved it.<br /><br />\\"Fix A Heart\\" is my favorite non-single on the album. I can really relate to it. You can't really fix a heart if someone broke it hard enough. One of her most amazing songs to date.<br /><br />\\"Hold Up\\" and \\"Mistake\\" are probably 2 of my least favorite songs on the album, but I still love them. \\"Hold Up\\" is one of the few songs Demi wrote on the album. It's about how she doesn't want someone to leave her alone and how \\"the weapon is their love\\". \\"Mistake\\" is about how someone finally made their biggest mistake and there's nothing that can make up for it.<br /><br />\\"Give Your Heart A Break\\" - The 2nd single on the album. It's about how Demi tries to prove to this person that she's \\"not like the rest\\" and asks them to give her a chance.<br /><br />\\"Skyscraper\\" - The 1st single on the album. Demi tells people that no matter how much they try to tear her down, she will \\"be rising from the ground like a skyscraper\\".<br /><br />\\"In Real Life\\" is another one of my favorites. It's about how Demi dreams of getting this person to date her, but in real life, it's never gonna happen.<br /><br />I love \\"My Love Is Like A Star\\" because it fits Demi's personality so much. She constantly tells her fans that no matter how much she may not actually be right in front of us for us to see, her love for us will always be there.<br /><br />\\"For The Love Of A Daughter\\" was a song that Demi wanted to be on one of the other albums, but it just now got accepted to be on this album. It makes me sad how many people can relate to this song. It's about an abusive father who won't show his love for his daughter, only his love for alcohol.<br /><br />The album ends with a remix of Skyscraper which is pretty good, but not as good as the original.<br /><br />I love this album. I know some people are disappointed in it because it is R&B and not Pop Rock like her past albums, but she said that the Pop Rock stuff was just a phase. I love this album and think it's her best one yet..<br /><br />\\"In Real Life\\" is another one of my favorites.

0738711500|5.0|This book/tarot cards set deserves every bit of the hype surrounding its release.  First and most important, the tarot cards are GORGEOUS & they feel just wonderful in your hands.  Second, I LOVE the book -- it's well written, fantastically organized, and explains everything really well.  Third, the packaging & layout chart are wonderful too -- they're beautifully designed & make the whole presentation look very cohesive and appealing.  They're the kind of extra touches that would make this set a fantastic gift for somebody who's just becoming interested in the tarot.
B004XWMXX8|5.0|When Selena & The Scene first came out with \\"Kiss & Tell\\" (their first album), I loved it but after a while \\"I Got U\\" was the only song that really stuck with me. \\"A Year Without Rain\\" was better, but still felt like it was missing something. \\"When The Sun Goes Down\\" delivers that missing something.<br /><br />\\"Who Says\\", \\"Love You Like A Love Song\\" and \\"Hit The Lights\\" are the singles from the album. \\"Who Says\\" is another \\"love yourself\\" song, telling you you're perfect. Even though it's a little cliche, it's still a good song. With \\"Love You Like A Love Song\\", the title pretty much describes the song. It's about how much Selena loves someone like a love song and she \\"keeps hitting repeat-peat-peat\\". \\"Hit The Lights\\" is a really good dance track, telling you to just forget all your problems and focus on the music. Definitely my favorite out of all the singles.<br /><br />Other love songs on the album include \\"Bang Bang Bang\\", \\"Whiplash\\" (my personal favorite on the album), and \\"My Dilemma\\".<br /><br />\\"That's More Like It\\" is about how originally Selena's partner was pretty controlling, but she taught him a lesson. \\"Middle Of Nowhere\\" is probably the saddest song on the album, where Selena falls in love with someone and then they leave her out of nowhere.<br /><br />\\"When The Sun Goes Down\\" and \\"We Own The Night\\" are two other dance tracks about just letting go and having fun.<br /><br />Overall, my favorite album of theirs. I highly recommend it.

0345803485|1.0|For only the second time in my life, I failed to finish a book.  By the time I reached the middle, I just couldn't read one more page....it was physically painful.  It is depressing to me that something so horribly written could become so hugely popular.  I  usually do my best to finish every book that I start, but after reading \\"holy crap\\" for the hundredth time, I decided that I would not waste one more minute reading this trash.  Life is too short to read a bad book, especially when there are so many other good ones waiting!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|usually I don't review but this was an awesome game. really don't find a lot of good games but this is one of the few games ive downloaded that I like.
0307744434|1.0|Well what can I say, I have just finished listening to an interview with two psychic twins Terry and linda Jamison who are the world's best psychic twins on 'It's rainmaking time' radio show, and they have been saying how the author has plagiarised many paragraphs, metaphors, quotes, story-lines and happenings that they wrote in their book \\"Separated at Earth\\" which is based on their life stories. 'The Night Circus' they say was based on their life in the 80's who invented the night circus with the acts. The actual twins have gone to 13 different lawyers to see if they can win a case against this author, but have been told it will be too difficult as the laws are sided towards the infringers. Apparently this author had a month to knock out this book for a special website/prize you can win and it makes sense she may have used the fanstic happenings from the Jamison twins' lives to spice up her book. I have the book and have yet to read it, and this will leave a sour taste on my mouth if I find similarities to the twins book.
B00526ZKYS|2.0|Delirium has some potential, I'm willing to admit that. However, if you've read one book about a future distopian ociety where the government makes all decisions for you, you've read them all. The plot is so overused, it's not even worth picking this book up. A waste of my money (I bought it at Barnes and Noble right when it came out). I ended up gutting the book and using it for craft material.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I'll be honest, after the first half of fifty shades I was pretty certain I would not like the book.  However, it then really developed a great story line (for erotica)and I ended up enjoying the entire series, and had a hard time putting the books down!
B007I2BZIE|2.0|While I think CS deserves more than 2-stars from a song review standpoint, I can't give it more than 2-stars due to the extremely poor mastering.  The level of compression used to master this recording exceeds anything I've heard.  This may be suitable for the MP3 format listened to on stock earbuds, but it is sad to hear it on home audio gear of any quality.  I love to listen to music loud, and I love to listen to RUSH loud.  But I found this album fatiquing after just a couple songs. Maybe if enough of us complain about the mastering they will take stock and issue a less-compressed version that audio enthusiasts can enjoy.

0345803485|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book and it made me want to read the rest of the trilogy.  I think this is either a love it or hate it type book.  I can't say it's the best book I've ever read (far from it) but I did enjoy it.
B0063GORYU|4.0|this game is great. I love it. passes time without boring you. fun for most ages. my teens even like this game.
0307951529|5.0|I loved this book! I've read it three times already. The best part for me was the variety of businesses that he profiled. So many biz/freelancing books that I've read tend to only or mostly have examples from businesses which mirror the authors' business - coaches write a business book that ends up mostly to be about how to start a coaching business, or copywriters write a book marketed as a general book on freelancing but only profiles other copywriters.<br /><br />In The $100 Startup, there's such a wide variety of businesses (dressmakers, programmers, coaches, brick-and-mortar, designers, infoproducts, horse ranch owners etc.) and it helped me to see how the principles he's talking about really do have a wide application that can be utilized in any business.<br /><br />My one complaint is that in some chapters he includes quotes or lessons from business owners but he doesn't tell you right there what kind of business they're in. Instead, it's \\"read more about so-and-so's business in Chapter 3\\". I would have preferred to not have to hunt for that information.<br /><br />This book is incredibly inspiring! It will motivate you to get off your ass and turn that \\"someday\\" passion into something that you can build a living around.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The app works well until you're ready to play another game and an ad pops up. Ugh its really irratating to keep closing it. Some of the controls aren't that good either.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good app. lots of variety so it takes awhile to get bored and it is very easy to get points so you can get new games for it
B0054JZC6E|4.0|ok so my child wanted me to download this app. most of the games he likes.. however there are a few thst are tough to finish but all in all we like it cuz it has variety.
0307887448|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in awhile. If you love video games 80's movie references and generallly nerdy stuff this is the book for you
0064431622|5.0|We all usually worry about how we look. We want to try to be more likeable, more trendy and be just like each other, and suddenly we feel that we are perfect just the way we are. That is the message we find in Eric Carle's book \\"The Mixed-Up Chameleon\\", which was one of my favorite books by him as a child.<br /><br />We follow a green chameleon in the yellow dry desert and how he changes colors wherever he lays he upon. However, he feels that his life is not exciting and then goes to a zoo. After he meets a few animals, he wishes to be like them, hoping to make his like more exciting. He then has his wishes come trueand then has the parts of many animals like a polar bear, flamingo, orange fish, deer, fox, giraffe, elephant, seal and even people. But he then feels unhappy and wishes to be back to normal, but will that happen?<br /><br />This book is truly worth the read to toddlers and will definitely get them ready to read. I just loved the illustrations and the lesson of the book is to learn to always be yourself and not to be others at all. So matter what, everyone's perfect just the way they are, even for a color-changing chameleon.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Well what an eye opening book. understand why so many middle aged ladies are enjoying it. Glad I was able to read it anonomously on my kindle!Enjoyed an entertaining book with quite a story line.
B001DF68MA|5.0|We love the WeeRide!  Our 20 month old loves sitting up front and seeing the view instead of daddys back.  She's sits comfy in it and doesn't fuss at all.  We purchased it last summer and it took a couple times for her to get used to sitting in it (it would have been an adjustment for her no matter what bike seat we choose).  Daddy loves her being up front as he can look at her often and whenever he wants.  We had to choose the WeeRide because of the type of shocks the hubby has on his bike, none of the regular bike carriers would fit.  We're so glad this was available.  Hubby has to ride with his legs spread a tiny bit further apart, but doesn't complain and says it doesn't make it that much more difficult to ride.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|A good read. Not a literary masterpiece by any means but compelling reading. Enjoyed it a lot. Characters get you in
B0086700CM|4.0|Its addicting. what I don't like is that once you buy something you didnt gave chance to cancel if you accidentally touch it.
0062082353|1.0|So poorly written that I could almost not finish it. THE book on the exploits of a US Sniper is the classic:  http://www.amazon.com/Marine-Sniper-Charles-Henderson/dp/1596072288

0345803507|5.0|I loved this book as well as the other two in this trilogy.  Easy reading with good character development - held my attention throughout.  This is truly a modern love story with a less than perfect man, but what a man.  Definitely the man of my dreams!<br /><br />I hope there are more books to come.
0345803485|4.0|The sex scenes were just ok and I do agree that the writing was a bit repetitive and immature. I did, however, get lost in the story and wanted to know what happened to this guy to make him behave the way he does. I never like movies better than the books but I do think this series will make a better movie provided they find the right leading man!
0143038419|5.0|At the age of thirty-one, Gilbert realizes that she does not want to stay married or have a child. Instead, she decides to embark on a journey of self-discovery.<br />This book is a self help book, a travel memoir and a biography. Gilbert documents her travels in Italy, India and Bali and writes about her thoughts, actions and the people she meets.<br />The work is well-written and entertaining.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|i hate that u run out of energy so quickly.  it would be helpful if the other peopleninnthe townncould help and you could control them too
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I would love to meet Jack Reacher, even though he would break my heart! Action packed and a page-turning (though sometimes gruesome) read. I'm currently reading #3 in the series and will continue to the end. Keep writing, Lee Child.
B001IF277K|5.0|Great price and it is still plugging away (a few weeks in so far) Some batteries can be sketchy but this seems to be legit.

034580404X|5.0|These books have been highly recommended to me by several people.  So glad I was able to purchase the entire editions from Amazon.  Arrived in excellent shape and really like the way they are placed in a boxed set.  If anyone is looking to purchase the books; receive in excellent condition; YOU ARE THE ONE!
0793518326|5.0|This book is incredible and is most likely the closest you will ever come to the exact sound. I have used this book for about 5 years now and have been very impressed by it. There are a few errors in the chords on the top of the transcriptions, but these are minimal from what I can tell. Overall, a really great book. I have never seen a closer transcription.
030758836X|5.0|One of the most original and compelling thrillers I have ever read.  The twists and turns had me totally off balance for the entire read.  The characters changed spots as often as the plot lines did and by the end I was panting.  Unbelievable!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|AWESOME!!! I could not put down all three of the books while I was away on vacation. A must read!
1612130283|5.0|I am only writing this review because I saw so many people leaving negative reviews for this book.  Ok, wake up people!  This book is meant to entertain you.  It is not Shakespeare for heaven's sake!  I enjoyed the book and could not put it down.  I went into it just wanting to relax and enjoy some mindless reading entertainment.  I was not disappointed.  The book had an interesting storyline (if you have an imagination).  I also read the 2nd and 3rd books.  I enjoyed the 2nd more than than the 3rd as it was a bit more predictable.  There is something for everyone in this series - love, romance, drama, crime, action, dark themes,and last but not least some very erotic passages.  I can't wait for the movie - \\"laters baby\\"
B0027MJU00|3.0|I love this author. I think she's a great writer and her other two books are wonderful. I found this one more difficult to read. I wasn't as captured as I was with her other two novels. The main character was totally unsympathetic. In addition, I even found her family in general, to be irritating. A lot of the characters are whiners, irresponsible, and generally unlikeable. I will say that about 50% of the way through this book I was more interested and couldn't put it down. I read the second half in a day because I couldn't wait to find out what happened. The main character became less hateful as the novel progressed, in my opinion. While I found parts of the ending to be interesting, it was too predictable, and the main part of the ending seemed very implausible to me. I am not one to think that all fiction should be like real life, but this was just too much so I was a little disappointed with the ending.<br /><br />For the review that said the author hates animals, I think that's ridiculous. Don't let that review stop you from buying this book. It's fiction. She writes about it as a way to tell a story like any author. It's like saying Stephen King is a racist because of the way he speaks about other races through the voices of his characters. You have to distinguish between the two, otherwise you have boring, simple characters with no real or interesting qualities to write about. Not to mention, she's never telling the story like the cruelty to the animals is a good thing. If anything it's just the opposite. Her first novel, Sharp Objects, told horrible tales of a pig slaughter house that made me never want to eat bacon again! I don't know if that was the point, but if so, it worked on me!<br /><br />Overall, I think Gillian Flynn is a great author and I can't wait to read her fourth novel when it comes out!
B005LAIH2W|4.0|I read the Barsoom series avidly as a young man.  I liked what Disney did with the story.  Read the books if you haven't.  The movie will make more sense that way.
B007KUFDBY|5.0|And I don't call it \\"My Favorite Movie\\" lightly. I've seen the movie about 273 times... not to say that I have enough time to watch it that many times, but I've owned the movie since it came out, and I used to watch it every night when I was a teenager. This is the kind of movie that you might be steered away from because it's not very well known, or because of its bad rep. If you give this movie a chance, you will love it. And that's a promise. Go watch \\"I'm Still Here\\" on Youtube. It's the song that plays during the movie to display a key emotional point in the life of Jim Hawkins. That will just be a taste. But this movie is very worthy of your Disney collection. It's got adventure, humor, a little love, and tons of heart (which is what makes a Disney movie). The only reason anybody will say \\"this movie is a dishonor to the Disney name\\", or \\"it's not worth the hour and a half it takes to watch it\\" is because they saw the movie once, with some previous speculation, and never gave it a 2nd glance. You really honestly have to be heartless to hate this movie. I mean, I understand if you don't enjoy animated movies, or it's lack of action, or maybe you didn't take the movie seriously at all and made fun of it the whole time (out loud, or in your mind), but this movie is definitely in the ranks of the Disney Classics. It's got everything the rest of the Disney classics have: adventure, humor, love, heart. That's all it takes to have a Disney Classic. Watch it at least 3 times, and I promise you it will be one of your favorite movies.
1585104205|4.0|Para el que busque introducirse en el estudio del latín, es una buena opción. Las lecciones (cortas, para menos de 1 hra. cada una) son bastante didácticas; siendo aplicado se podría prescindir de un profesor, al menos para lograr un primer acercamiento.<br />Algo que quizás se echa de menos es contenido para ejercitar. Se ha establecido la mala costumbre de vender por separado edición para estudiante, profesor y de ejercicios. También sería útil si incluyera un poster u hoja resumen con las declinaciones... pero en fin, se entiende que los editores explotan al máximo sus ganancias vendiendo todo por separado.

B0087YYHZU|5.0|I should probably start this review by admitting that I'm not really a fan of the old-fashioned movie musical.  (There, I said it; now I just gotta hope that my dance school lets me finish out my lessons.) Films like 'Oklahoma,' 'An American in Paris,' and 'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers' just don't cut my mustard.<br /><br />To be fair, there have been exceptions to this (`The Wizard of Oz,' `Mary Poppins,' 'My Fair Lady,' `Fiddler on the Roof,' and `Singin' in the Rain'), but as the saying goes, these tend to prove my rule.  Each of the aforementioned exceptions has some ineffable quality besides their nice tunes that distinguishes them as cinematic gems - an infectious energy, an epic scope, or an emphasis on story and character that I'd always felt evaded the standard old-Hollywood musical.<br /><br />`Singin' in the Rain' works so well for me, I think, because it's actually about something beyond its admittedly great musical numbers. It locks onto a very specific moment in film history - the transition from silents to `talkies' - and miraculously develops a very funny, fully realized story with genuine character development that still allows for some wonderful song and dance numbers. (As an added bonus, these numbers usually seem to grow organically out of the plot. Except, perhaps, for the scene with Kelly and Cyd Charisse, but I digress...)  And those dance numbers *are* wonderfully done, and are often astonishingly choreographed.  How Donald O'Connor wasn't carried off set on a stretcher after the final take of `Make `em Laugh' I will never know, but his work led to lead to one of the (if not *the*) greatest movie musical scenes ever filmed.<br /><br />The film is rightly considered a classic, and one of the best films of all time.  But more than that, it is quite simply one of the most fun.<br /><br />*Please Note: at the time of this review's publication, the Blu Ray hasn't yet been released.  I may add more commentary at the time of release.  Until then, though, I figured another glowing review of the movie itself couldn't hurt the disc's chances of selling.though, I figured another glowing review of the movie itself couldn't hurt the disc's chances of selling.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It's okay for a solitaire; but kinda lame compared to others.  It works for a distraction; but not a frequent one.
1612680011|5.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki is a highly successful book that criticizes the status quo and calls for a change in how we organize our lives. It calls for us to challenge some things that our parents have taught us concerning success. In the book, the author shows us the old school teachings of the poor dad and the innovative thinking of the rich dad who succeeded even without following the conventional path.<br /><br />If you are deeply steeped in the old school thinking of `go to college, study hard and get a good job,' this book may challenge you. In the ever-changing economy, this kind of thinking is becoming obsolete as we see more and more people become successful in business without even having completed college. The book is not cancelling out the need for school; it is proposing that education does not guarantee success in life unless you are able to think innovatively and competitively. Today, there are no guarantees that a large company will hire you just because you worked hard in school.<br /><br />This is a recommended read for teachers, parents, students and anyone who may be looking for an alternative way of accumulating wealth other than the conventional, rote approach.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I've been using this blade primarily to baton fire wood.  It is a force to be wreckoned with.  The blade needs to be maintained with oil to prevent the edge from rusting, but it holds a great edge.<br /><br />Every camping buddy who tries it out wants to get one too, because after holding 16 oz of pry-bar thick sharpened steel in your hand, no other survival utility knife compares to the BK2.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|Am 50-yr old female, saw this movie with my 22-yr old nephew and his friend - all 3 of us enjoyed it.<br /><br />Plenty of funny/gross alien moments (where you find yourself cringing and saying \\"eww!\\" and laughing at the same time) - the usual MIB routine, with maybe a little more \\"eww\\" to the aliens then in the previous movies.<br /><br />Josh Brolin was an excellent casting choice to play the younger version of Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones).<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: I would not say it was better or worse than the other MIB movies, to me they are pretty similar. Not a \\"must see\\" movie - but certainly fun/enjoyable.

I ordered it, thinking it would be a \\"who dun it\\" with a twist.

0525423281|5.0|Oh. My. Golly.<br />This book made me want to squee and laugh and jump up and down and hug myself. So I did. Mutiple times. One cannot contain the joy and happiness and emotions that Lola and the Boy Next Door holds.<br /><br />If I'm not careful this will just be one long, gushy review, so let's start with a list of things I loved:<br />1) Lola's parents and her relationship with them. When I'd seen people saying how much they liked this I figured they would be the \\"best friend\\" type of parents, but they weren't. Her dads are very protective of her, but you can tell how much they love her too. They yell at her and ground her and do normal parenty things which is awesome.<br />2) Max and Lola's relationship. Going in, I figured I was going to hate Max since he sounded kind of douchey. I didn't, though. No matter how much I wanted to hate him I just couldn't. It was interesting to watch Max and Lola's relationship deteriorate knowing that theirs wasn't the most important relationship of the story.<br />3) Cricket Bell. I mean, really, do I even have to say it? He's kind, funny, sweet and fantastic, but he's more like a real boy than almost any other I've read. I love that he's transparent about his feelings which means, yeah, he does yell at Lola (not in an abusive way, promise) once or twice because he's so dig darn frustrated. In more ways than one. He gets angry and sad and we see it all. Plus, he's super nice to his sister and little niece. Oh gosh, I've got to stop now before this turns into an all out \\"gush about Cricket\\" fest.<br />4) ANNA AND ST. CLAIR! They aren't just a small part of the story, they're Lola's friends! How cool is that?<br />5) Lola. She's so colorful and lively and real. She yells at her parents, storms out of the house, cries on her bed, agonizes over guys, makes impulsive decisions, gets gooey-eyed over her neighbor, and makes mistakes. I could go on and on, but what I'm trying to say is that Lola is someone most girls will be able to relate to. She's always second guessing herself and wondering what she's supposed to do which basically describes the being a teen.<br />6) All the clothes talk. You might think that it would get to be too show-and-telly, but it didn't. It was fun reading about everyone's clothes from Lola's costumes to Cricket's pin-striped pants.<br /><br />And then the review was getting long and gushy so let's wrap this up!<br /><br />The Nutshell: Lola and the Boy Next Door will make you laugh, break your heart a little, and have you swooning all over the place. This is definitely not your typical girl-meets-girl-long-journey-to-love-happily-ever-after story. I mean, there is a happily ever after, but it's not all about Lola getting the boy next door. In fact, she's still with Max for over half the story which I thought was really interesting. This is one book you do not want to miss. Even if contemporary isn't your thing, you should give this one a chance!<br /><br />Direct Hitate to.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|Enjoyed reading the book.  Ended where you have to read book 2.  Can't decide weather to love or hate Christian Grey.
B00884GR0W|2.0|this app is more advanced and  has a better concept than minecraft p.e. but it is so hard to use. crafting is hard and building is PAINFUL. in a block game building should not be PAINFUL. Im a huge minecraft fan and ill tell you my honest opinion. dont bother with this. just getminecraft for the pc at minecraft.net. because even if you dont think that its good enough as it is you can mod in practically anything. I simply got sick of the building being PAINFUL.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|Its the best. One of my favorite web browsers to use on my phone. It runs flag when needed and of you ate on slow 3g you can use opera turbo to speed up your browsing and let their servers computed data before sending it on to your device.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Paranormal Agency is a \\"hidden object\\" game. In this game, they give you the outline of objects you're supposed to find in a very cluttered scene. It's not really my type of game but I can see its merits.<br /><br />It's great game that doesn't require too much investment. You can pick it up for a stage or two and move on to something else. The game runs great. Very easy to interact with. No glitches yet.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Very pleased have limited time at home product arrived earlier than projected very pleased with the overall service will definitely use again
B000SXLL8O|5.0|I love the acoustic guitar tracks on the album. It's a pretty mellow album and the singer's voice can be a bit thin or drab but he can still really emote his longing, passion through the songs.<br /><br />A great listen!
B000002ITM|5.0|TESTAMENT is a incredible thrash metal band...RITUAL is another thrash metal masterpiece...Chuck Billy´s voice is amazing and all the band shine high!!!! It´s way more polished and slow than previous classics like PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH and THE NEW ORDER...songs like DEADLINE, THE SERMON, LET GO OF MY WORLD, ELECTRIC CROWN and AS THE SEASONS GREY are metal gems...just don´t expect raw fast tunes like DISCIPLES OF THE WATCH or THE PREACHER...RITUAL got a more PANTERA / ALICE IN CHAINS vibe...AMAZING!!!! A MASTERPIECE!!!
B003Q6BQPS|5.0|This is my second Winter Village set. I previously bought the Toy Shop. In my opinion, the Holiday Bakery isn't as good as the Toy Shop but the Toy Shop is now discontinued.<br /><br />LEGO does a great job creating a fun winter, holiday environment with this set. There's a lot of detail in the set that bring that vibe like the snow, holiday lights and the skate rink. LEGO tries to add humor by depicting one of the minifigures as stuck head-first in the snow.<br /><br />This set is intended more for adults and older children. Younger children who are pretty passionate and patient with building will also appreciate this set. The building process isn't as simple as with other sets like LEGO City or Ninjago. A lot more detail is pushed into the design which sometimes mean a little more difficult or tedium.<br /><br />Well worth the MSRP and a great addition if you collect the Winter Village sets. Makes a nice display for the holiday season.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love how many translations it gives and it reads to you!  I can take it every where and have my armor ready when I am
B001230JXC|5.0|I'm a bit too young to have experience these songs the first time these songs were released. Having only heard some of these songs on the radio, it's great to experience the album in all it's glory.<br /><br />The sound quality is great and the music is deep, dark and raw. A great listen!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book. For me it was truly magical. The description are captivating. The circus itself is one that I would love to explore. All of the characters are interesting different, and complex. I found myself reading it for hours and not realizing how much time had passed. On a more negative note it is a little dense. This book jumps back and forth between times and places constantly. It can get to be hard to follow. There are many characters and it takes a little while to get acquainted with everyone. All in all it is suspenseful and unique and although they don't like to call it magic it is magical. You will fall in love with the circus.
B000002J1Y|4.0|This is an ambitious live set with some impressive artwork by Roger Dean (I remember the quadruple gatefold sleeve and opening it up and not knowing how to fold it back properly, I nearly ruined a friend's older brother's LP's inside- sorry for that!). Aside from that, it's Alan White's debut with Yes (he's one of the few members of Yes, whom though not an original member, stayed in Yes after he joined as long as the Yes band name existed). Still, Bill Bruford plays on 3 songs (Long Distance Runaround, The Fish and Perpetual Change), as he left the band in the middle of their 1972 Close To The Edge tour. The album features exclusively songs from their Yes Album, Fragile and Close To The Edge albums. It all begins with a recorded version of the finale of Stravinsky's The Firebird Suite (if you'll pardon the digression, I find it hard not to think of Yes whenever I hear this- I often think Jon Anderson's voice would've been appropriate at the finale of Fantasia 2000). Then after the final bars sound, Yes rips into Siberian Khatru. Rick Wakeman plays his harpsichord piece on a Hammond organ (not bad, just different). This would be the opening track for many of their tours. Following, you have Heart Of The Sunrise (Alan plays a tempo faster than the original). Going back to the earlier moments of the tour, Bill takes the drumkit and includes an impressive drum solo on Perpetual Change. And You And I features a different intro from the album and Steve Howe's echoing feedback at the end is more pronounced than on the studio version. Steve plays Mood For A Day on a steel string acoustic and the appreciative crowd is faded out. Later, we fade back in as Jon sings a few bars of the finale of Stravinsky's The Rite Of Spring before he introduces Rick on keyboards. Rick plays selections of the then-upcoming The Six Wives Of Henry VIII (featuring a few of the movements in addition to some old school melodrama which would make Charlie Chaplin proud, the Hallelujah Chorus and a finale of some synthesized fireworks). Steve introduces the opening riff of Roundabout on electric guitar. Jon sings the chorus slightly differently and Chris and Steve join in after Steve's opening guitar solo is reprised. The coda ends more rocking and Jon says goodnight to the audience. I've Seen All Good People features some acoustic guitar work from Steve (the \\"Your Move\\" sequence) and the ending differs with some singalong chorus at the end of \\"All Good People.\\" Then, Rick and Steve play their parts on the intro of Long Distance Runaround, at a slightly faster tempo. Steve plays the bridge between that song and \\"The Fish,\\" Chris's bass playing tour de force, in which he plays most of the multi-tracked parts individually. Close To The Edge features the pre-recorded birds and Steve's guitar solo at the beginning differs due to probably not getting the same pedals. Also, the finale which on the record has the Bb, Gm, F, Dm structure is changed to Ab, Fm, Eb, Cm so Jon can more easily hit the high notes. Yours Is No Disgrace gets 4 extra minutes due to some jamming. Rick adds some impressive piano at the beginning before the majestic opening bars and Steve plays some fast and furious riffs before Rick plays the organ leading to \\"Deaf-defying, mutilating...\\" Jon for some reason starts out in Dm before going into the key of D. Appropriately, the set closes with Starship Trooper. Jon's voice cracks a tad at the line \\"Shining wings.\\" Steve substitutes the acoustic guitar of the Disillusion segment with electric guitar and the band breaks before singing \\"Folloooooooow.\\" Finally, at the Wurm segment, Steve jams away at the G/Eb/C segment, with some fine improvisation from Rick on keyboards. Jon closes with a high B note and then thanks the audience and bids them goodnight. Though the recording of this may sound a bit sloppy (I have heard some CDs have improved on the sound quality), this album features some very spirited performances from Jon Anderson, Steve Howe, Chris Squire, Rick Wakeman, Alan White and Bill Bruford.
B007VLHP9K|5.0|The people reviewing this set are those who have already accepted Celibidache's way with Bruckner, and I am among them.  Like some of the other reviewers, I had these videos on Laserdisc (better quality than VHS) which were clearly identified as high definition video. The Laserdiscs looked better than these DVDs.  I transferred the LDs to DVD myself and I think I got a better picture than these DVDs. I don't know what source Sony started with, but they could have done better by starting with the LDs. I have to believe that Sony could have produced a very good Blu-ray edition of these videos.<br /><br />Each of the three videos on Laserdisc contained a 2-3 minute introduction that talked about Bruckner and showed pictures of St. Florian Abbey where Bruckner was the organist and where he is buried. The background music for that short video was a Bruckner organ piece and was very effective. I wish Sony had included this short video on at least one of the DVDs.<br /><br />Furthermore, I would have appreciated an attempt at a surround sound audio track.<br /><br />By way of comparison, I just received a Blu-ray [[ASIN:B0084AW9KC Symphony No. 7 [Blu-ray]]] of the Bruckner 7th with Celibidache conducting the Berlin Philharmonic in 1992, his first concert with them since 1954. This was very well done and includes a documentary about Celibidache's early work with the Berlin Philharmonic and showing rehearsal for the Bruckner 7th.<br /><br />All that said, I am grateful that these have finally appeared on retail DVD.
B0086700CM|3.0|at first its a fun game and then you start buying stuff from the store and then it lessons the fun. eventually the game starts to lag and about 70% of the swipes you do don't work. you get killed off of stupid little things like bareley swiping you screen to jump or turn. the controls get twisted around and  when you go to jump you slide or when you go to turn he goes the other way. I recommend for only ancestor days of gameplay other than that this game is not worth your time.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is challenging but relaxing; frustrating but fun. I can't put it down! If you're looking for a mind boggling puzzle that is simple yet entertaining, this is your game! PS I've been know to use the hint button :0)
1118109791|1.0|When you register for the GMAT you get a couple practice tests and 90 practice questions with explanations.  This book doesn't appear to give any unique information.  If 90 problems isn't enough you can get more 400 more for $25.  That's the same price as the book and the computerized practice is is a lot easier to use than flipping around in the book.<br /><br />This book isn't much to help breaking down the way you should attack each type of problem.  It's all practice problems and then explains (not in the best detail) why the incorrect answers are wrong.  The unofficial books might give you some better information as far as what to look for when solving different problems. (?)<br /><br />I would strongly recommend not spending money on this book because it doesn't contain anything that the GMAT folks won't give you (included with your $250 registration fee) once you sign up to take the test.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|After about 15 minutes of play- you have to put in real money to keep your character from dying.  Horrible trick.
B006B9REH6|4.0|Very nice momentum of this tour if you were there. She plays all the great hits. The sets are spectacular. She is truly a musical prodigy.
B005J4ASDG|5.0|Originally my daughter was the one who introduced me to this symphony (courtesy of YouTube).  While I saw the movies in the theater and own the DVD's....I had never considered getting this collection before.  I'm not sure why either since I really loved the music. What I found (and my daughter as well) is that it is very peaceful and stimulates the mind (which makes for great studying).  Although at times the music builds, I do not find it to be unwieldly nor overly distracting.  Having it in MP3 format allows me to transfer the music to my MP3 player and listen to it wherever I am.
B004UID2LC|5.0|this app is pretty sick! I like it because its really easy to use and fun. you can download videos and music.  plus it makes a cool sound when you download stuff :-)
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I thought it would be a useful idea to have this app and I was right. It tells you when to charge and how long it will take. Its nice to know.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game. hard to beat... to many ads though... interrupt ur game sometimes and also freezes a lot. its a pretty addicting game. I like the yarn game lol
0439023521|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. When I first looked it over I didn't think I would like it, thinking this was more of a teens book. Well my teen talked me into reading this one and I was hooked!
B002G1YPH0|3.0|Not sure how to rate this product.  It was recommended by a lot of people as one of the best heat sink/fan coolers.  I personally idle around 32-35C (using a i7 2600k @3.8GHz).  Other people say it should idle around 26-28C.  Maybe it's my old case or maybe I suck at applying thermal paste.<br /><br />I \\"should\\" be able to overclock to 4.5ghz easily with this baby, but when I do that and run Prime95, it explodes over 90C (which of course isn't good.)<br /><br />So, others say it's great.  It might be.  It does it's job for me though, although I wish I could overclock without worrying about burning my CPU to a crisp.  Oh well.  Good luck!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|sk many different games to choose from that if you don't like 1 there are 10 others you would like.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is not to easy but not too hard I must say the makers of this game did an excellent job.
B004ZJZQ5G|4.0|This version is very far from the book and I can't really see Keira Knightley in the role of Elizabeth Bennett after Jennifer Ehle and Greer Garson.  Of course, I love period drama, so even this version of Pride and Prejudice works for me.  I ordered the Blu-Ray just for the scenes of British countryside and they are beautiful.
034580404X|5.0|What a fantastic story! Look beyond the BDSM which is very light. This story will captivate you and make you feel very much a part of Anastasia and Christian's relationship. You will be laughing and crying with this story. And feeling every part warm and fuzzy in all the right places. A perfect combination of mystery, humor, love & oh lets not forget SEXY! This is no Twilight. Very much for us big girls all grown up. I loved it!! You will find yourself reading this story over and over again.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was written differently than any book I have read before, with one persons view and then the next chapter being the other persons view.  And it continues that way.  I wasn't sure about how I would like it or if I would continue to read it but it did capture me.  I haven't finished yet but I can say you won't be dissappointed, this book gets a big WOW from me.  Incredible twists.
1594744769|5.0|Absolutely beautiful concept and story. I was riveted from the first page and couldn't put the book down until I had finished it. Each of the characters are vividly constructed with distinct personalities and quirks. Photographs were blended seamlessly into the pages to help personify the highly fantastic characters the author had created. I would and have recommended this book to all my friends and family.
1607885719|4.0|Pretty fast paced book that kept my attention during a long roadtrip.  My husband and I decided some parts could have been rewritten, but for the most part I would recommend it to anyone who likes action/mystery.<br /><br />I enjoyed having a male voice for the male parts and a female voice for the female parts.  This helped versus the usual man having to elevate his voice to fit a female part.
B00170GXQ2|5.0|Each time I watch this movie (which must be 100+ times by now) I find something new in the visuals or production.  Full of beautiful details and very close to the original story, albeit some directorial license has been taken as to the order of the storyline.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so amazing!!! I am so happy with it. I have not experienced any glitches at all.  Yea!!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I cannot say anything negative about this app so far. It has not crashed my kindle or slowed it down like oyher users have said. I use this every single day and view community notes all the time. These help me with quiet times. The only recommendation (not negative thing) is that the NASB be made available for offline use. YouVersion has done amazing things with this app.
B00846REIS|1.0|I just wanted to say congrats to whoever is marketing this book series- you did a great job positioning this as the next 50 shades of grey. HOWEVER, you will probably lose all the money you make off the quick sales of this book bc it SUCKS. I read the first 20 pages and couldn't FORCE myself to continue. I have no idea how this book isn't considered plagiarism. WTH!?!??!?!
0345803485|4.0|Like others I wanted to see what all the fuss was about! Not the best book I've read, but not the worst. The writing is repetitive- as are the sex scenes- it became predictable but for some reason I couldn't put it down. I read all 3 books in 4 or 5 days- I needed closure...lol - not quite sure if I got it, but close!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|this is a very reliable app. its really easy to look up scripture. only drawback is the you have to be online to read it
B007LYB0PC|5.0|Have listened over and over. Just wanted to get my +1 in here. Highly recommended if you dig any of JW's other stuff with White Stripes/Raconteurs/Dead Weather...
B000068TPN|4.0|The Vietnam-era movies are fairly hit and miss, but this movie is the former IMO. I couldn't say how much of this story is historically accurate but the action was decent and Sam Elliot is the man! I wasn't impressed with many of the actors, or parts of the score, but overall it was an enjoyable war movie that delivered on most counts.
0670034711|5.0|Great book. I highly recommend it to anyone, whether you are going through a rough time in your life or not. Touches on the importance of mind, body and spirit. Gives you important points to reflect on in your own life.
B0056WODZ0|3.0|This is a romance and adventure story.<br />Not the best, but yet fun and light. Is easy to enjoy and has one laughing in the right places.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I thought it would be  cheesy games but actually great game lie within. Great for children too. ages seven and older. awesome.
B0055Q5F36|5.0|This is the best case I have ever had for any phone I have owned! I have dropped my S2 so many times, and work in a hard industrial job with my phone in my pocket. No matter what punishment I put this case through, at the end of the day my S2 is always in mint condition. If you buy an S2, the otterbx is a must.
B00782O7IY|2.0|The Artist is a seriously disappointing movie and I do not understand how it won even one Oscar. A silent movie star is eclipsed by the advent of talking films and sinks into a drunken slovenly depression and is finally rescued by another star, a woman whose career he helped to launch. That's it. There are no subplots, nothing else, no surprises, no messing with our minds, no dark corners where we might not want to be taken. The story line is flat and linear and just boring. Who cares if the cinematography is excellent? This is a lazy film.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|it takes to long to buy land or anything you need.. things are priced way to expensive. makes playing the game unenjoyable.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love it an adicting game that u cant help but love it is a game for all ages u should definetly get it
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|awesome game to play! the one my phone is much better, newer designs and more options for words. please update asap!!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is a 5 star game I love it best running game ever real hard makes stuff extra cool. and this is what people are looking for
B000093BDX|1.0|The sound quality, or lack thereof, is very irritating. I should have paid more attention to the reviews. Don't buy this album. The sound is muted and the bass buzzes in the speakers. Some tracks are barely acceptable, others are weak and just pitiful. We have a Camry and I don't expect the sound to be superb, just listenable.
0345803485|1.0|This book was absolutely terrible. I honestly don't think I've ever read a worse one.  The characters are thin and unbelievable, the main character always blushing, flushing, biting her lip or thinking things like \\"oh crap!\\" or \\"jeez.\\" I could hardly finish it, but I mustered my way through sex scene after sex scene, hoping for some kind of redeeming ending. Nope, just a pathetic girl in tears over an equally pathetic breakup.  Terrible.  Will not be reading the sequels.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I love these headphones, very hard to find.  I finally found them on Amazon and they are very inexpensive.  They weigh next to nothing, do not put pressure on the head or ears, the wire from the component to your mp3, speakers or whatever is not super long or short perfect so you don't get tangled up in things.  I have very small ears and cannot wear the ear buds so this is perfect for me.  absolutely love them.
B002UHTTWQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, the way it was written made the characters come to life as you are reading the book. Can't wait to eard the other books that follow
B000XR4OC0|5.0|My 6 year old daughter has two pairs and I have one pair.  Her first pair we bought a week before kindergarten in the white paisley, about a year ago.  Other than being filthy - they are still in excellent condition.  Her second pair the navy with white polka dots were bought in March - Still in great condition as well.  She wears them every day and plays just as hard as every other little kid on the play ground.  We just ordered her first grade pair in natural and are having an artist paint star wars characters on them, she is recently obsessed with star wars and there are no cute star wars shoes for girls.<br /><br />I personally love that they don't make her feet smell hideous like her other shoes that she wears without socks - ie stinky sperrys!!  And they are way cuter than her clunky crocs!!<br /><br />I bought the silver crocheted pair.  At first I wasn't impressed with the quality, they feel cheap and light when compared with her classic pairs.  But I'm light on shoes and they have held up fine.  I don't run marathons in them, but they are cute for the office.<br /><br />In my opinion, you will be buying tons of shoes for your kids growth spurts - why not buy the pair that gives a free pair to a child in need?
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Once I began reading this series it became almost an obsession. Very vivid and emotionally involving characters and a fantastic story kept me constantly engaged. It's difficult sometimes to find a story that doesn't throw itself back into an old framework but this is one that blazes it's own trail. I have no problems giving WOOL five stars. Thank you Hugh!
B007XNAQ6A|5.0|I was really impressed with this tough performance. Simon LeBon's voice has really developed into a boombastic force and the players are tighter than ever. Compares favorably to their 1984 live \\"epic\\" ARENA, more imminent than nostalgic. Mark Ronson lit a fire under my childhood heroes' asses while earning his place in rock history. RESPECT
B004MC8CA2|5.0|best Bible app I have found! I love it!!!!! I highly recommend this app to others.  I have even taken my kindle ti church so I could use this during the service.
B005FITIDC|5.0|This movie makes made me realize how selfish I can be. There are far more worst things out there going on in Africa and made me realize that I should be grateful. This movie is based on a true story and Sam Childers is a modern day saint. I strongly recommend this movie
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I instantly got hooked as soon as I started reading. I haven't read a book this good in awhile and stayed up til 3am it finish it in one night. I did not want the story to end I am really hoping for a sequel. I have been recommending this book to everyone I know. Amazing good with this one!!!
0345803485|2.0|A Critique:<br />REVISING YOUR FIRST DRAFT BEFORE SENDING IT TO YOUR PUBLISHER IS A GOOD HABIT TO DEVELOP<br /><br />DOPE COVER ART THOUGH
1468161660|5.0|I just picked this booked because it was recommended because it was similar to other books I have read. I started reading and was instantly hooked and couldn't put it down. I finished within a day and bought the second one instantly. I want more I didn't want it to end. Great job!!!!
B000002UCO|5.0|When I ordered this album on cassette 4 years ago, I was blown away! I keep it in my car so I can listen to it on my way to work when i'm in a bad mood. This tape puts me in a good mood! I listen to side 1 on the way to my work and side 2 on the way home! I strongly recommend this album!
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run has been a great experience on my Kindle Fire. It keeps me wondering what I'm going to do next. Question. Have you ever had the same run twice? I haven't either. If you want an app to play when you're bored or just an app. This is the game for you.
B007P06DJK|5.0|I had seen the A&E presentation of the 25 year anniversary of Graceland.  It took me back to when it all was happening.  Being a \\"boomer\\" (age 63), I consider myself fortunate enough to have experienced and lived while many of our younger people can only read about what makes up our histories.<br /><br />The music and songs on Graceland are as endearing, magical and relevant as they were while they were happening.  This CD-DVD was well done and wonderful!!  I love it as much now as I did when I first heard it.
034580404X|2.0|I wanna start by saying I LOVE AMAZON !!!! everything i order - and i order A LOT from here is fine , more than fine... the few times there has been an issue the seller has replaced items without even askin for me to return even!!! now with the fifty shades trilogy i just ordered i recieved quickly , finished book one on to book 2 on page 230 and all the pages just fall out and keep falling out, i tried to contact seller , but it will not prompt me to do so :( so review is all i have!!!! i keep and save all books i read especially one's i LOVE!!! and unfortunately book two fifty shades darker is falling apart , very sad!!!!!<br /><br />sincerely and upset/disappointed<br />Jena Iachetta
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Before I read this book I thought it was just another book people just had to hype up about but after reading it myself it certainly deserved it. I look forward to reading the other two books from this trilogy.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This a great game with just enough difficulty to keep you challenged but not so much that it becomes another one of life's frustrations. The creator doesn't make you purchase help it's all on youtube. This is definitely one of my favorite games!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I helps a lot with my old Kindle Fire.  Old one charger didn't work well so this helped how long I could play for x amount of time! USE THIS APP!!!
B007MLDC2I|5.0|When I first heard that Hollywood was going to do \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" and that Daniel Craig was going to play the lead role as Mikael Blomkviwz my first reastion was 'Great! Hollywood is going to ruin another perfectly good story just to make a few bucks'. I couldn't see Daniel Craig as Blomvkiwtz frankly. I thought he did not make a good Bond so how in the world could he pull off Blomvkiwtz!!<br />Hollywood tends to take stories and change them to appeal to a targeted audience who likes to see the plot and its characters fit into a narrowly defined category.<br />I was wrong, wrong, wrong.<br />Daniel Craigs portrayal of Blomvkiwz was amazing, on Par with the Michael Nygvists portral and in many respects the script written for Craig was truer to the nature and personality of Blomkvist than the Swedish film.<br />Hollywood was also more faithful too the Novel. Staying very close to the book and responsibly makikng minor changes to the plot and characters to avoid having to film a mini series. Bravo<br />I need to mention only one minor exception that was easily overcome by the acting of Rooney Mara (Lizbeth). In the first novel and the second novel a great deal of attention is drawn to the size of Lizbeths breast, which were abnormally small. Rooney Mara has very nice breast, well shaped and natural looking. They did not fit the character of the withdrawn Lizbeth, but Rooney made up for it by nailing the portrayal of Lizbeth as if she was Lizbeth. Startlingly I thought she did a better job of it than Noomi Rapace who played Lizbeth in the Swedish version. Rapace's breast were unusually small and she had the stature and facial structure similar to the character described by Stieg Larson. But in the Girl that played with fire her breast did not change as they did in the Novel due to plastic surgery.<br />I would highly recommend seeing this movie if you are a fan of the novels and the Swedish films of the novel.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|omg..... i was obsessed with this book! i could not put it down... being a teen that loves books with the perfect amount of action and romance this was the most perfect book! this series of books has to be my all time favorite... my hands down to suzanne collins who also wrote my second favorite series... the under land trilogies! i amstill freaking out that that was the end... i dont want to say goodbye! : ` (
B0086700CM|5.0|Fun game. It is simple, but very addictive. Of course they try to sell additional credits but it is not necessary to spend any money.
1451629192|5.0|Honest, revealing, emotional, triumphant and so incredible that this strong, vibrant woman would allow us to view the secret world from the depths of her soul. A story I have thought about since that day in 1991 when I was pregnant for my first child, and always wondered what happened to jaycee.<br />You are a real, and very inspiring human being! Your girls and the rest of the world should be proud.
0553573411|5.0|Royal Assassin is the second book of the Farseer trilogy, which tells the story of FitzChivalry Farseer, a royal bastard and assassin. Fitz's last mission went awry, and he is resting and recovering at the beginning of this book. However, he's a King's Man and can't afford to take any time for himself, so he has to get back to his duties as the royal assassin soon.<br /><br />Royal Assassin is just as compelling as the previous book, Assassin's Apprentice. Fitz has grown up a little, although he's also become quite melancholy because of his failures and his perceived weaknesses. However, he's still intensely loyal to the Farseer kingdom and family, especially Prince Verity, and will do anything in his power to keep him and the Six Duchies safe.<br /><br />The Red Ship Raiders are continuing to plunder and destroy the Coastal Duchies, and there seems to be no stopping them. Worse still, the foppish and ambitious Prince Regal is gaining more and more influence, and he doesn't seem to care about the threat posed by the Raiders - in fact, all he cares about is living in luxury and attaining as much power as possible. Burrich has tried his best to keep Fitz from using the Wit to bond to an animal, but Fitz meets and bonds with Nighteyes, a young wolf. Fitz is already in danger - Regal hates him, and if he's caught using the Wit, it'll be certain death for him.<br /><br />Everything good about the last book continues in this book - every character gets even more depth and backstory, there's a lot of complex political intrigue and plotting, and it's fascinating to see Fitz make mistakes and grow as a person. Fitz is often morose, which can get annoying, but not too much. I also really liked the character of Queen-in-Waiting Kettricken and her evolving relationship with Verity.<br /><br />The end was a bit shocking, but I can't wait to read the conclusion!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|What a neat little app!  It has such a variety of mini games, it surely has something for everyone. My only issue is the cost of the games. There are only so many times you can play your favorite before it gets boring. But then I'm sure that what the game makers count on to entice you to spend your real money.  With a little patience the games get better, and you will eventually find one you don't mind playing repeatedly in order to gain more points which you spend to get better mini games. You are sure to find a favorite here, especially if you find yourself with time to kill.
0765348276|5.0|I've been reading John Scalzi's blog, Whatever, for a few years now, but I haven't gotten around to reading one of his books until now. I think Old Man's War is one of his most famous books, and I was able to get it for a bargain at Half Price Books, so that's the one I chose to start with.<br /><br />From reading his blog, I expected Scalzi to be a good writer, but he exceeded my expectations by far! Old Man's War is set in a future where humans are colonising the stars, but livable space is at a minimum, so there are constant battles. The Colonial Union, an entity entirely separate from Earth's government, controls all human space efforts. The only way to get off-world is either to get picked by them to colonise, or join the Colonial Defense Forces (CDF) on your 75th birthday. John Perry is doing the latter.<br /><br />The world of Old Man's War is fascinating, although it seems like it's about to come crumbling down. Given the mystery of the CDF, I expected a grand conspiracy or a secret plot, but Scalzi plays it totally straight. The book was obviously inspired by Starship Troopers (which I actually like a lot), but has better writing and an author that's not crazy. I haven't read a good adventure story in a while, and this book definitely filled a craving I didn't even know I had.<br /><br />I loved the idea of the CDF recruiting old people to fight, since they have the life experience necessary to be wise and understand the importance of their fight. It's a very sensible idea. John Perry is a great protagonist, and every character in the book, no matter how minor, is full of life. Scalzi has a great sense of humour, and it shows!<br /><br />I can't wait to read the next book, [[ASIN:0765354063 The Ghost Brigades]].
B0083GQKQG|4.0|I read the book and could not wait to see the movie.<br />I will tell you this, if I had not read the book, I would have no idea what was really going on.
0756405890|5.0|The Name of the Wind is THE fantasy book I've been wanting to read. I've seen great reviews of it almost everywhere, and I was really excited to get a chance to read it.<br /><br />We're introduced to the protagonist Kvothe (Kote), who owns a bar in a village in the middle of nowhere. However, he's actually a great hero of the times who's hiding from the world. When one of the most influential scribes in the world, Chronicler, comes to his inn seeking him, Kvothe agrees to tell him the story of his life, but insists that it would take three days to tell. This book covers Day One.<br /><br />This is an epic book, not because of what happens, but because of the way it's told. Kvothe tells of his childhood, how he made his way into the university, and his adventures at the university. The world is rich and the pacing of the story is spot on. A lot of things look like they're going to be predictable, but get unexpectedly overturned. (Kvothe is quite genre savvy.) I don't really want go into details, since I don't want to spoil the story.<br /><br />The framing story is also exciting (and building up slowly.) There is a war on, and evil creatures are making their way to Kvothe's village, sooner than expected. Meanwhile, Bast, Kvothe's apprentice, is very worried about his master, since he just appears to be waiting to die.<br /><br />The characters are terrific - Kvothe makes an extremely believable protagonist, and the supporting cast is (mostly) just as wonderful - Ambrose seemed a bit over the top, but still plausibly so.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this story is that not that much epic fantasy happened. I'm not even sure if it's a problem, since it was well paced and well written, and a good change from other typical fantasy. I can't wait for [[ASIN:0756407125 The Wise Man's Fear: The Kingkiller Chronicle: Day Two (Kingkiller Chronicles)]]!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator.  It is easy to use and great on the eyes.  It looks like a real calculator and is the size of the screen.  Great for any budget... you will definantly use it often!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Definitely a 5-star read. I would love an alternate ending to #5 - the ending was really good, but could have gone another way very easily and also finished great.
B003CBTVNG|2.0|I didn't find this movie particularly funny.  But, this is the type of comedy that I don't really enjoy.  If you enjoy silly movies (like \\"Dumb and Dumber\\"), then you will enjoy this movie.  If not, then steer clear of this movie.
0547258305|5.0|I loved this book! As an adult, I am big on the fantasy world books and this book was perfect for me! I agree with some of the concerns of strong female character who rejects the idea of marriage or children, but it never bothered me. There is also some rather discreet sex scenes, as someone else stated, so maybe keep both of those in mind before suggesting the book for younger audiences. The female character is a strong, independent young woman, which is a great change from what we see sometimes. I'm not going to bother writing a plot summary or anything over analytical, because a lot of the reviews touch on the key points of the novel already... I thought it was a fun read that kept my attention. It wasn't until I started telling my friend about it that she pointed out a weird similarity between Hunger Games Katnis and Peeta and Katsa and Po, but besides being a interesting and unique read, the two book's similarities stop there.

OMG from the beginning I had a massive crush on Alexis Bledel, she is SUCH a mega hottie. I got so jealous when she would hang around Miss Patty, Alexis was mine. I haven't gotten to watch this box set yet, I duck taped it to my ceiling so I could stare at it as I fall asleep. I bought each season individually as well. I must say the box set dissapoints me, it does not stand up to saliva at all! Rory's face is now just a wet smudge. Now I'll do Pros and Cons<br /><br />Pros; ALEXIS BLEDEL<br />  RORY<br />  THE MAIN CHARACTER<br />  THE YOUNGEST GILMORE GIRL<br />  RORY'S OLDER SISTERS' SISTER<br /><br />Cons; Poor Quality<br />  Fell on my face from above, doesn't resist gravity<br />  Miss Patty gettin all up in my woman!

B007KAJG3K|2.0|Aside from the issue that Ultraviolet is not a digital copy and that the studios should be ashamed about using this marketing tool to fool the public, this sequel is a perfect example of what is wrong with Hollywood productions (and perhaps mass audience taste). Dull and uninspired, Game of Shadows is an exercise in fast cuts and pacing to fool the audience into believing that they are watching something truly exciting. Instead we get extensive use of special effects, an insipid plot, some good one-liners, and confusing use of the Guy Richie action foreshadowing technique that was more understandable and surprising in the first film. Downey and Law surely had some fun making this film but the most interesting role here was 'Mad Men's' Jared Harris' take on Moriarty. Too bad the producers did not think that audiences might actually want a real Sherlock Holmes film and not this one aimed at the 6 year olds in all of us. If you really want to see a great re-interpretation of Sherlock Holmes, you will be better served by watching the recent BBC series reboot. Use this one for background noise while you cook dinner.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I liked the movie. Prometheus is not as good as the original Alien movie, but good enough. My question: is it going to be an extended version released on bluray or the original theatrical release? I've heard rumors that extended version was what Ridley Scott wanted, but theaters wanted a shorter version (about 20 - 30 min shorter).
B00008CLOA|2.0|I have both the original LP and the first issued cd, both sound much better than this remastered POS, don´t buy it I just wasted my money on it !!!  I have an Ayon Triton II, Sonus Faber speakers and an Accuphase CD, a good enough system and a good ear to be able to tell apart a good well mastered cd or lp from crap, this is crap.  Too many sounds effects, sounds dull and compressed.  This is bordering on heresy, taking one of the better LP´s in the history of music and killing it is simply unacceptable.
B000Q76K24|5.0|Everybody does an excellent job and provides a credible story and 2 hours and 48 minutes of beautiful attention to every detail and characters who, while being caricatures of the psychopaths who are taken into S&B, provide a sense that this is how it works. De Niro put his heart into this project and should be very proud of the product. One of the final lines regarding use of the article \\"the\\" says everything we need to know about the psychopathic mindset operant in our country today. Read the negative reviews and see the kind of minds that didn't like this movie and for what reasons and, if you be such, stay away. Otherwise, enjoy yourself with a well made and entertaining production.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book is about sex. I read it because several friends recommended it to me and said any Twilight fans would like this. Nothing like Twilight.<br /><br />The biggest issue I have with this book is the main character lacks a lot of self-worth. She is constantly viewing herself as not good enough, etc, and allows herself to be totally captivated by a billionaire who is a control freak and abusive. The sex scenes are long-- addictive at first, but after awhile it just gets to be too much.<br /><br /> As many reviewers have already stated, there are too many repetetive words.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT (don't read on if you don't want to know the ending of the first book!)<br />-----------------<br /><br />The reason I stopped after the first book is because they break up at the end. I was happy with this, as I am a college girl myself and thought \\"yay, now she can have a real HEALTHY relationship and get her self-confidence back instead of being dragged down a dark hole\\". I didn't want to read the next book because based on other reviewers I realized she just gets dragged into it all over again, and they even get married. I don't think it is realistic and it is definitely not a book meant for teenagers. I feel it gives the wrong idea to women to put sex before self-worth.<br /><br />That's all I will say. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because it was an addicting book and I found myself reading the whole thing even though I was disgusted by so many of the ideas.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. In my opinion well worth a read. Recommended this book to friends and family, they also enjoyed reading.

B00479SVBU|4.0|I have tried three other fm players and this was by far the best made. It has a nice solid case, easy to access controls, and a fair sized screen that shows pertinent information. Look on the Satechi web site to get a rundown on all the included features, I couldn't find any other players that compared. Unique features include an OFF button, a bookmark button, and folder navigation. I had no problem with the fm connection, worked right out of the box at the station that was preset. Sound was clear as any CD I've ever listened to in my car.<br /><br />That's what I liked, now for what I didn't like.<br /><br />The software model was confusing to me. I'm a Linux person so maybe non-Linux people won't even notice anything as being wrong. When I first played my usb stick I figured the folders and songs would play in alphabetical order. However, that was not the case. The Soundfly is also capable of playing 5 levels of folders deep. At first I couldn't see any subfolders at all. The songs and folders are played in the order that they are written to the device (usb stick). Coping whole folders to the stick didn't copy the song order (even when I used Windows), I had to copy one file at a time. The subfolders are accessible, but they are sorted so that they show at the end of the main folder list. So if you have a Beatles folder with The White Album as a subfolder, The White Album will show up after your ZZ Top folder (at the end of the main folder list). I expected it to show up after the Beatles folder.<br /><br />It's a keeper none the less, just a little disappointing.

B0053KWDES|5.0|I purchased the HiFiMan RE262, and love it! I found it to be pretty much perfect driven by my 6.1 Receiver, and pretty good on my FiiO E6 despite the obvious power limitations. For those of you that don't know, the RE262 is a 150 Ohm IEM. This means that it takes considerable drive from an amp to perform at its best. The FiiO E6 just didn't feel powerful enough for it, although it had been more than sufficient for my other low-impedance earphones. Also the RE262 is a mid-to-high frequency emphasizing IEM. The E6 could boost the bass, but it sounded like it had been modified and kind of trashed.<br /><br />I knew I needed more power. After some shopping around at the sub-$100 portable amp level, I decided on the E11 as it was supposed to have a better amp than the E7 DAC/Amp and I didn't need the DAC, so it was pretty simple. Honestly there are not many competitive amps outside of FiiO when it comes to portable amps under $100.<br /><br />I have to say, I'm very impressed with the E11. It manages to power the RE262, and it is probably one of the most hungry portable audio devices you'll have to drive. Not many portables go higher than 150 Ohms. More impressive though, in my opinion, is the equalizer/bass boost feature. While the E6 could increase the volume of the bass, the E11 manages to preserve the tight nature of the bass, increasing volume while remaining clean. I can feel the rumble now. That's just something that the RE262 just isn't known for, either. I'm not a bass head by any means, but the bass boost is surely powerful and clean enough to make the tamest low end sound tight, and give it *plenty* more body.<br /><br />If you need more power on the go, try this amp out. I doubt you will be disappointed.<br /><br />Note: If you would like some more headroom and dynamic range, I suggest you give your low-impedance headphones the gift of an in line resistor and boost them. You should be able to find a quality resistor adapter for around $12 on the big auction site that everyone knows. The resistors are cheap enough that you should be able to get a few in 75, 150, and 225 or 300 Ohms.
B007QWF26C|1.0|Blade II was 2.35 on DVD but this version is the 1.85:1 TV version. The same as the ALLIANCE version from CANADA last year. The new BLADE and BLADE 3 are in the correct format.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved this book.  I especially loved that I could download and read it free as an Amazon Prime selection.
B005LAII1C|1.0|Hollywood keeps on producing sellout rubbish.<br /><br />The teddy bear CGI was really well done but the only remotely funny scene in the film was the punchup between MW and TED.<br /><br />Plot was lame and cliche and the humour was was unoriginal, juvenille and moronic. Most of the characters were obnoxious and stupid, and most of the humour revolved around sticking fingers into a55holes, farts, d1cks, bongs, dry humping, and that freaky looking Flash gordon guy.  Even Mark Walburgs GF wasnt that hot.
0061743526|5.0|I lived 4 years in America and have heard so much about the book. It is a classic and I decided to read it. As a European I find it a bit difficult to understand the writing style from the author. But slowly I get there.<br />The book meets my expectations!!!!<br />It brings a smile on my face, sometimes I roar with laughter:)<br />I'm still reading the book, I take the time to understand it and got to the chapter in which the colored man is accused for raping a white woman.<br /><br />But so far, I think it's a great book!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome book. Finished in one day. Once you get passed the S&M, the book is quite hilarious with the incorporation with personal thoughts from the main character and the emails...hilarious. Made it all worth it.
B0043WHUGS|4.0|I read some of the reviews.  To the people who were lost or didn't get it....definitly DO NOT see Rock of Ages then.  You wouldn't get that either.  Both movies are similar in that a story is created using old hit songs and their lyrics.  Like Moulin Rouge.  Across the Universe was good for the great music.  Most of the songs were performed in the same style or version as the original.  Very nice movie worth buying because it's worth seeing again from time to time.  Weren't The Beatles great?

030758836X|5.0|All I can say about this book is that it was absolutely wonderful, twisted, and kept me guessing. I had three different theories for the reason of Amy's disapperance, but Flynn just kept me guessing. Real, developed characters that I actually believed to be people. Just a fantastic read.
B0034G4P94|5.0|Whoever was in charge of promotion of this movie should have been fired. It's a shame it didn't get more attention. I am happy that Nick Nolte got an Oscar nomination, he deserved it. Warrior is a story of two brothers and a recovering alcoholic father who have to find a way to forgive each other as well as themselves. The title is bad, and the premise has been done many times before, but it's still very much worth watching as the characters are very real. What I love most about this movie is that even when it seems so easy to cast blame, the truth of the matter is that people are people. They are flawed and messy and foolish and scared and can still be worthy of love and forgiveness.<br /><br />Most people in America don't know who Tom (Tommy, the younger brother) Hardy is (even if they did see Inception), but they will soon (he plays Bane in the upcoming The Dark Knight Rises). I've been following his work and his talent is pretty remarkable. I can only hope that his career will be steady and consistent and incredibly long lasting. I also hope he doesn't become some over exposed, weird, untouchable uber star that people get sick of once they discover how talented and \\"hot\\" he is. It's for my own selfish reasons, as soon as Hollywood decides someone is \\"the next big thing\\", it seems they work to destroy him/her as soon as the novelty wears off (even though he's been acting for at least ten years). I hope he's around for a long time. After you watch him in this movie and a few others (Stuart, a life told backwards, Wuthering Heights, Rock n Rolla, The Take) you'll hope so, too.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is riveting! Could not put it down. Finished the series in 3 days. I am glad the book ended the way it did. Loved seeing the main characters evolve. I enjoyed the epilogue, Christian's first Christmas, and the beginning of the book from Christian's perspective...<br /><br />E.L. James needs to write a book in his perspective to provide a well-rounded view as to what is going through his mind throughout the book like she started at the end. Those few pages were definitely a tease. I can say the same about the epilogue and Christian's first christmas. Makes you want more! Even a book from Kate and Elliot's perspective would be great. Maybe any of the character's perspective that were involved in the main character's lives.<br /><br />UGH I hope E.L. James write more! Love the series!<br /><br />Highly recommend the book. It is funny and sexy and \\"real\\" at the same time. Two thumbs up!

030758836X|1.0|This book was fabulous until the last page.  It just seemed like the author gave up and didn't really care about the ending.  With all of the twists and turns throughout the book, I felt she had a lot of opportunities to draft an amazing ending.  Very disappointing.
B006RUJST6|4.0|I enjoyed this book on many levels.  The plot, strong real-life hurdles intertwined with a complicated romance, was well written.  It's probably a Young Adult focus but I was surprised by the depth.  I laughed and cried while reading it.  That is rare for me.  I think this author has a very promising future.  I'm very glad I stumbled upon this.
067144901X|5.0|My younger kids enjoy this wonderful book by Sandra Boyton. It has a rhythmic quality that helps young children learn language. Really great for bedtime. For older kids, I recommend another bedtime story by Emma Ward - Our First Race. [[ASIN:B007VGOGA6 Bob and Joe in Our First Race (The Adventures of Bob and Joe)]] It's destined to be a classic as well. Both books are wonderful and kids seem to like all the books published by these two authors.

B004LUS390|5.0|I use this on a 7\\" Polaroid tablet, which I got primarily for a digital sketch/art pad.<br /><br />This is the best program I have found so far for drawing/painting on my tablet.  It takes awhile to get used to zooming in and out to get finer details, but, I think that might be for any program on a tablet, as I'm having to adjust from the touch of dsi screen to a tablet screen.<br /><br />There is a color selector that has basic colors AND a color wheel that allows you to choose many many different colors/shades/tints.<br /><br />The pen/brushes begin with simple tools, but when you open up the tool selector, there are then 3 pages of various pens/paintbrushes AND you can further vary these with a screen that you can pull up, with opacity/transparency, angle, \\"soft\\" \\"solid\\" \\"hard\\", etc.  (You can spend a lot of time just playing around with the pen/brush editor, add to that the colors and, well, it can distract you from your actual drawing/painting!)<br /><br />It doesn't change orientation (is set in portrait) BUT I turned my tablet to do some images in \\"landscape\\", save them, put them in a simple photo program on my computer, rotated it (it saves as \\"portrait\\") and there didn't seem to be any quality loss, if there was, I couldn't tell it, as the image was large enough to display well on my computer screen.  It also printed well, at least in a smaller size, (5x7 I think I used, maybe 4x6).<br /><br />As far as I can tell, there is NOT \\"cut & paste\\" or selection of image to manipulate, but, that's ok as I usually want to have the feeling that I am working on a drawing board or at an easel, (with the convenience of being able to erase/save a copy/try different variations).<br /><br />Yes, to improve your experience,you do have to quit out of the program every so often, about a little over an hour or so, to keep the zooming from jumping around, but, actually, it forces you to take breaks from all the drawing/painting you are doing!  Just \\"save a copy\\", get up & stretch, etc., select your image, and continue.<br /><br />Good quality of completed images.  One more thing:  The images do not seem to save to the actual SD card, it saves in a file that says sd card on it.  I am able to get to them from my computer (older one, so it should work on most anyone's computer) through the USB cable, looking up in \\"My Computer\\".
143911000X|5.0|This book is a great choice for pretty much any person that isn't uptight... Overall, it is relatively short and can be read in 30 mins or so depending on how fast you read, but you'll probably be spending a fair bit of time laughing.

B002JTHFUS|4.0|My wife is fan of U2 and she loved this gift. The book and pictures included are of very good quality. I just had one complaint. The cardboard frame that holds the CDs and DVD at the bottom of the box was torn.

B0074VTHKM|1.0|Grisham may have intended this book to be for young adults, and if he did, that's fine.  However, the characters are thinly drawn, the plot is not the least bit intriguing, and all of the elements with which Grisham has made his reputation are absent from this effort.  I was/have been a fan.  I read Grisham for pleasure.  His characters are generally compelling, and the plots unfold in such a way as to invitie the reader to hope for justice, fairness, and faith in the American Way.  This book fails on all counts.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it keeps me entertained for 20 -30 minutes I really really love it. its awesome. everyone should get it. its a great app
B002RHGYOA|5.0|First time reading a book on my Kindle App and it was a great book to read. Loads of Twists to keep you entertained, I couldn't put it down. I love the character Salander and feel like I know her well and understand her. Stieg Larsson was a great writter and I really love this triology.<br />The book ends on a scene that makes you want the 3rd book straight away to find out what happens next. I'm now half way through the next book
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This concept album by the immortal trio RUSH is an amazing comeback from the last two studio albums. I was looking for a song or two from this album to keep me connected  to one of my favorite bands ever, and was blown away! It is heavier, which was not something I was looking for, but technically, it is astounding. For me, Geddy Lee stands out like the virtuoso I know him to be, with fills everywhere, and a frenetic pace that belies his age. Alex and Neil are the standard awesome as well, of course. The concept itself, the story of a young man's adventures and woes, is interesting, but the music is catchy, riff-driven, and addictive. There should be at least two radio hits out of this, but we all know that RUSH doesn't get radio play. Sad. Anyway, I have listened to nothing but this album for three weeks, and I live it more every time I hear it. Standout songs are the title track \\"Clockwork Angels\\", and \\"Headlong Flight\\". Wow. Buy it immediately if you haven't already.
B0088WFZQG|5.0|It was a great movie!!  I have read other reviews that state the acting was not great, I did not even notice it. After I rented the movie, I purchased it.  It was that good.  Everyone who watches this movie will have more respect about the threats that are out there, I know I did.
0553386794|1.0|I was wondering why I dislike the Game of Thrones, and it was not totally because of 1000 characters that are impossible to remember and keep track. Within these four books you won't be able to find any shred of love, affection, or loyalty. These books are full, and I mean FULL, of cruelty, betrayal, and violence against women and children. Brothers kill brothers and sisters, sons kill fathers and mothers. Everyone can be bought or be fooled for power. I really don't understand what HBO saw in these books to make a series.
B004UID2LC|2.0|well, this app is kinda in between good and bad... it crashes ALOT on my kindle fire.... also your probably just as good to go through youtube.com with this app... I give it 2 stars cause it crashes during a video, even just searching through them it crashes every ten minutes...
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it soooooo much<br />it ia the best game ever<br />better than any other game<br />it is the balmb<br />it is beast
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Great game. The question is fun. I love Mahjong. Cool graphics and like the ability to choose from different tiles.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This was exactly what I was hoping for. Light weight, yet durable. I love the stand capability and that the soft cover cleans my screen while it's closed.
B007VGXS8M|2.0|My 5yr old daughter and I had so much fun with this game. We played a little every day for a week and played certain parts over and over until we got the 3 coins and found all of the books....well we can not find the last book in Japan at all. At this point I don't believe it exists. We can not go any further in the game and open the last level. We put in so much time and effort into this game and it really s*cks that we cant finish. Ive read other reviews mention this about the book but I figured that since I am a huge fan of more advanced hidden object games Id find it....WRONG! Seriously Gameloft if you're making a family friendly game with Waldo make sure that people are able to find the items!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is fun and easy for my little kids to play.  They have been unable to put it down since we have loaded the app.
B0085KGHI6|2.0|This could of have been a stellar event. Instead it is merely a satisfactory superstar blues jam. I would rather they edited it down to 20 minutes because as soon as a STINKING drunk and OBNOXIOUS Lefty Dizz walks onstage, ALL momentum stops and all the good vibes are killed instantly. His presence on this disc is a blot that cannot be overcome. The few songs with Mick and Muddy, Keef and Woody are fun, not spectacular..its a loose blues jam...and Buddy Guy steals the show despite his seriously out of tune guitar. A must have I suppose, for Stones completists and HARDCORE blues fans but not for the casual fan or the un-initiated. Again BE WARNED....When LEFTY DIZZ walks onstage, he RUINS the show.
B0086700CM|5.0|Thank you for bringing this to my kindle fire! Love it on my android phone too! Too fun and addictive! My kids are hooked too!
0345803485|1.0|So.. it all started very innocently- I knew 50 Shades had been on the top bestsellers list for a while, and thought \\"what the hay, let's give it a shot!\\". Worst piece of literature I've ever read in my life, mind you this was inspired by the Twilight series, which I unfortunately read and didn't care for either, but this novel is the holy grail of crap. Anna is introduced as being a young naive college graduate, who is majoring in Literature but has never used a computer in her entire college career, or sent an e-mail for that matter. Give me a break! This story is set in 2011, it is obvious this EL James person personified herself as this Anna character, because someone please tell me what college student - or high school student for that matter doesn't know how to turn on a computer and send an e-mail?? Anna calling her computer the \\"mean machine\\". I wanted to vomit right there.<br /><br />But I digress, the character development in these novels are atrocious, and in fact I kept waiting for something to happen to Anna- Is she going to get killed off? Is something going to happen to make me think this book is not just a bunch of crap?? but no, no twists, no give-aways, just a really SUPER annoying whiny virgin who is always second guessing herself because a bazillionaire-super-gorgeous-french-speaking-athletic-hung-pianist-singer-a**hole is interested in her (no sh*t). Give. Me. A. Break. The ONLY thing that kept me reading this terrible novel was so that I could say I read it. Unfortunately, now I will have to live with the fact that every time I hear someone say \\"Holy Cow\\" or \\"Jeez\\" I have the uncontrollable urge to strangle them. Save yourself the money and just rent a scripted porno, I promise you the acting will probably be better played out than what you will read in this book. The repetitive sex scenes, catch phrases, and talks of inner-goddesses were enough to make me want to rip my own eyes out to keep from reading.<br /><br />Lastly, someone needs to giveE. L. James the definition of the word \\"submissive\\", constantly in the book Anna is described as \\"strong\\" and always pushing buttons, where in reality she is always doubting herself and trying to \\"please her man\\"- it really pissed off my inner-feminist. Bottom Line- don't give E. L. James anymore money or buy into her series- God forbid she gains the confidence to write something else.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|love this game! the creatures are adorable and I love  completing the families.  would be nice to have more ways to earn acorns.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What an outstanding story! The story got me wrapped up into right from the very first page. I'm hoping that the story will continue so I can find out what happens to all of the other silos. I also like the fact that the author kept the price of the book low. I find that refreshing.
B002ZG9940|4.0|Though this movie is very dark in its content I have enjoyed watching it more than once. You have never seen Clooney in this kind of role and he is excellent as a frustrated, hunted and desperate man. As good as Clooney is, the scenery gives him a run for his money. The Abruzzo region of Italy is featured and it is simply breathtaking. I highly recommend this movie, just be prepared for the dark content.
0061438294|5.0|This book was so good it's the first time I ever left feedback!  It's easy to understand and there are examples and drawings of the postures as well.  I bought two best sellers on body language but this one was by far the best!  I highly recommend it!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Loved the first three movies and so excited for the new one.  This game is so fun I love it.
140053271X|5.0|My NOOK 1st Generation got run over.  It was covered under the damage warrantee,  but 1st Gen is not available any longer.  So I could have my choice of either NOOK color, or the simple touch.  I am so glad I chose the simple touch.  It does not do music,  audiobooks or videos.  No games.  Just your basic, no frills, dedicated reader.  That is all I need.  I expected the transition from the old NOOK to the new one to be difficult,  but it was actually seamless and quite painless.<br /><br />Several reviews I've read complained that transferring reading material from one to the other was difficult and time consuming.  However, I found it to be very easy.  All I had to do was register the Simple Touch in my account,  and my books appeared as if by magic.  I did have to \\"help\\" some of them,  but that was easy too, requiring just a touch on the download prompt.<br /><br />The touch keypad is larger and easier to use than on the 1st Gen, although with \\"fat fingers\\" or poor hand control,  a stylus makes a nice aid.<br /><br />Someone in another review forum said that the Simple Touch lacks the ability to highlight and make notes.  This is absolutely not so.  In fact,  these functions are actually easier than with the older device. Bookmarking has also been improved.  You get not only the page number,  but also a partial quote from the first line on the page.<br /><br />Another review stated that there is no provision made for preventing unauthorized purchases.  This also is untrue.  The owner may enable a password if desired.<br /><br />Navigating within a given book is much easier.  I have several devotionals,  Bibles and resource books and accessing various sections and chapters is incredibly simple.<br /><br />I would definitely buy the Simple Touch again.  I would give it as a gift.  I have already recommended it to friends.<br /><br />I did not care for any of the Barnes & Noble covers for the Simple Touch.  So I bought this one [[ASIN:B005EMQ8IW rooCASE Executive Leather Portfolio (Magenta) Case Cover with Stand for Barnes and Noble Nook Simple Touch / Nook Simple Touch with Glow Light]] It is absolutely fantastic, and inexpensive but not in any way cheap!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is cool sometimes it lags but when its done. it works great after that.I have almost beat the game I like
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Janelle Monae is a phenomenally talented singer and writer, and this effort, \\"The ArchAndroid\\" proves it multiple times. Though it's not for everybody's taste, I find this album to be fascinating, funky, imaginative and incredibly well-produced. Lyrically most of the songs are quite deep though there are a couple I am still struggling with. It did take me a couple of listens before I got comfortable with the album as a whole. Musically there are so many catchy hooks, which nonetheless remain intricately structured, that I find myself singing them over and over in my head. Certain songs such as \\"Tightrope\\" are so accessible that they grab you immediately. You have to understand, I am a 58-yr-old woman. I am not a fan of rap, but this girl can rap so well that even I like it!<br /><br />If you are open to more experimental sounds and ideas, enjoy new approaches to music themes, and just know a good set of pipes when you hear them, then you will enjoy this album. I highly recommend it!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i like watching my village grow. it has been a lot of  fun playing the  game. I like ice age village.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|so far. so good only thing is the stupid energy that u have to wait for other then that I like it
0451196716|5.0|I will admit to having mixed feelings about Mr. King's writing. Some I love, like the dark tower series (especially wizard and glass) others not so much (Tommyknockers). But the Long Walk easily falls into one of my favorite stories, not just from him, but overall. The premise sounds boring but by the end of the journey you have gone through the whole range of human emotion and felt real tangible fear of the machine that controls us all. The story is completely relevant with the now ended war in Iraq, the continuing war in Afghanistan and the \\"War\\" on terror in general, and how we view the service of our children towards our nation. I seriously can't encourage people to view this one enough, I normally don't write reviews but had to put in my .02 when I saw this book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love playing this game!<br />can't. wait for more to do each day. also love the movie franchise!<br />totally recommend this game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|like it its an fun game for their kids. and of course me to. it does freeze a lot tho
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I strongly disagree with the two previous comments. First of all, maybe you should learn to READ random things that you agree to, second of all no one is forcing you to buy things. It even tells you in the description BEFORE YOU BUY IT it clearly states that there will be optional IN- APP PURCHASE of stuff. otherwise, I think this is a very good game that I would reccomend as long as if you choose not to buy in app content, you should read many things that come up on what you click on
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it so much. Plus its freeeeeee!  Plus its better then temple run brave that game is sucky never buy it buy this instead. You friend Jessica.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great game. Addicting and fun. Can play while watching TV or doing other activities.  Fun to see what configuration the pigs will come up with next. Highly recommended.
B007BZM30M|4.0|This song is very good quality. It is a little low sounding but still very enjoyable. It is as good quality as itunes. I couldn't have expected more from Amazon.
B004SKJTY6|2.0|This is a mini-documentary about the making of the movie, not the movie itself. I did not realize that when I purchased it, and was greatly disappointed. Be careful what you are getting when you place any order here.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|My husband and I both found the movie entertaining.  We both found it to be better than expected based on movie reviews we had read while it was out in theaters.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I have got to say, this book is great. I read the entire thing in 2 1/2 days.  I was hooked from the beginning.  It is a great departure from other books in this genre that are cookie cutter plot lines and ever popular today.  I liked that the lead female had an edge to her that made her a strong female in her own right, she did try and do the right thing, but sometimes, even in real life we are drawn to things at are wonderfully uncomfortable.  Travis, the lead male was shattered and broken, but not for any deep rooted psychotic reason, he lost his mother at a young age and never had a strong female presence in his life, he didn't know how to treat women...that is pretty direct.  It had twists and turns and concepts that were fresh and exciting, and it was nice to know that the \\"romantic\\" scenes didn't dominate this story.  They weren't graphic and they weren't every other page.  This book is mostly story...is you are looking for a 50 Shades/Bared to You type read, sorry this isn't for you.  But I still HIGHLY recommend it!
0385335997|5.0|After the near-pointless 600-page flashback that was [[ASIN:0385335970 Dragonfly in Amber (Outlander, Book 2)]], I was reluctant to start Voyager. But like the whispers and hums through the stones of Craigh na Dun, it pulled me back in.<br /><br />It's a good quarter of the novel before Clarie returns to 18th-century Scotland, but a lot happens before that point. We get a quick glimpse of Jamie's return to Lallybroch after the Battle of Culloden and his subsequent imprisoning at Ardsmuir prison. There he meets Lord John Grey, who is another character out of time--gay in the 18th-century English military. I'm glad he turned out to be an honorable man, and a good friend to Jamie, unlike the other despicable gay characters we've met during the course of this series.<br /><br />Anyway, we also see Claire in the 60s, trying to figure out what happened to Jamie by pouring over historical documents. Gabaldon is good at tying things together like this. Claire's deceased husband, Frank, was a researcher, and the skills Clarie picked up during their troubled marriage come to good use.<br /><br />One thing I really appreciated Gabaldon doing is making Frank a sympathetic character. It would have been easy for him to just leave Claire, but he tried to love her, even though she couldn't love him back.<br /><br />The narrative returns to its usual first-person POV once Claire travels back through the stones. Ooh boy, are things really rolling in the 18th-century. Her and Jamie's journey takes them all over the place, way beyond Scotland and France, in pursuit of treasure and pirates. These are real pirates of the Caribbean, and it's fascinating to see how they lived. Never before has reading a book made me seasick.<br /><br />When magic rears its head in this series, it's always riveting and shocking, and a bizarre ritual at the end of Voyager is one of the strangest, most vivid things I've ever read. I had to go back and re-read it to make sure I hadn't just dreamed it the next day.<br /><br />I am normally averse to long books because with my short attention span, my eyes wander to my TBR pile. What's next, what's next? But with Voyager, I wanted to go back and read it again from the beginning. That is exceptionally rare, and I will treasure this book for a long time. I can hear the [[ASIN:044022425X Drums of Autumn (Outlander)]] calling...<br /><br />--chancelee.comday.<br /><br />I am normally averse to long books because with my short attention span, my eyes wander to my TBR pile.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Folks, I've read a lot of books on our elite SEAL teams.  By far, this is #1 of all.  Adam Brown is my new hero and I cried like a baby at the end.  (which is very unusual for me.<br />I can't recommend it any higher than to say it is a 10.<br />JP
B00406TRU4|5.0|The Merlin series is a fun way to escape into the world of kings, wizards and dragons without leaving your comfort of your home.  It has some humor, romance and magic for all ages to enjoy.  It was very interesting to find out that the shots and some of the scenes were filmed at Pierrefond, an existing castle in France.  I can't wait for the season to start again on the SYFY channel.
B0055J7F40|5.0|I rented Paul one night when I was bored. I laughed so hard that I had to buy it! I've watched it two more times and I'm still catching things I missed previously. Still laughing as hard as the first time I watched it.
B008IBR88K|5.0|It is always a concern to start a second season when the first was so brilliant.  I'm three episodes into Season 2 so far and quite pleased with the evolution of the show and the characters.  I will avoid spoilers but so far there have been a variety of new characters to add spice.  Some old characters continue their wicked ways though there are spots of nuance.  Meanwhile, some of the characters I did not like have begun to redeem themselves as they search for meaning in the new world of Downton Abbey of WWI.  The scheming and plots and twists of fate are all still there and the writing is still crisp and acting still lovely.  Highly recommended.
B007SGM084|1.0|This book is absolutely terrible! I cannot believe all of the followers it has gotten and I truly do not understand the love people feel towards Christian Grey! If you are a reader (as in not just a once in awhile book reader) this is NOT the book for you. You will wish for your time and money back. If you must see what the hype is all about as I did then please do yourself a favor and borrow it.
B0011E9LBI|5.0|M.I.B. is a movie I saw when it first came out and enjoyed. Years later I decided to buy it to add to my collection. In my opinion. It's a really decent movie.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Good story line, lots of sex, not great sex but just sex...Okay read for the beach. Author did a good job with making sure you understood the role of all the characters. All in all, just okay, for all the hype!
B007NZDES0|5.0|As always, Sade did an oustanding performance.  This live cd/dvd of the tour was great. I'm very happy she decided to capture her world tour. Thank you Sade and looking forward to the next.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|The more I listen to this cd the better it gets.  I'm blown away by the combination of excellent production values, the emotion coming from not only Tedeschi's voice but every player on this cd and that (with perhaps one exception) every song is incredible.  This is truly one of those magical efforts where the end result is way more than the sum of the parts.  I can see this becoming one of my favorite cd's of all time - and I'm 60!<br /><br />Hey TTB, if you're checking these reviews, please get another cd out there ASAP!!
0788832182|1.0|The dvd did not work and I was not happy with that at all. The screen was distorted and unwatchable... The disk was not scratched so I was surprised by this, i was very disappointed.
B007V508CC|4.0|I won't say this is my favorite CD that I own.  I don't think I'd say it's my favorite Maroon 5 CD.  However, it's an overall enjoyable CD.  There's really only 1 song that I don't particularly care for on the whole album.  I do kind of like that they didn't really do any ballads on this album.  If you're worried you won't like it just sample the songs online before buying it.  I'm glad I made the purchase.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is fun although its hard to get as many points as you need to unlock the other games
0307949486|5.0|Great book- elucidating, well-crafted, and exciting.  This is clearly the work of a master writer who doesn't need to use flashy action to tell a story.  Each of his characters feels like a living, breathing person whom we could meet on the street.  I gobbled up this book as well as the second one, and felt as is there was not enough time in the day for me to stay with the author as he told his tale.
B006RUJST6|5.0|was very surprised with this read. so emotional. i bought the sequel as soon as i was done. i loved this book. you will be cheering for this couple right from the start. made me thimk of my first love and how pure it is when you are young  could read this over and over again.
B006Y9BULE|5.0|As usual amazon is  great.<br />Seller did an excellent job too.<br />Watch is interesting.<br />Solar powered.<br />Good size.<br />Solid feeling bezel.<br />Very well priced.<br />Very water resistant with screw down chrono pushers often seen on pricier watches.<br />Doesn't get as much wrist time as the seiko monster.But it's a completely different beast.<br />I took off bracelet and put on a nylon strap.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|Its a great game overall. The Kindle Fire version is way too far behind the other versions. And the cost of items in Glu Coins are unrealistically high like most every other micro-transaction game.
034580404X|5.0|Hi,<br />In short, the entire experience is great.....ordering is simple, price it nice, and I received the books in no time....and, WHAT A GREAT READ!!!! Thanks!!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|I thought this book was way better than Fifty Shades. I loved Fifty Shades and the love story in it, and was looking for something to fill thevoid once I finished the trilogy. This book was perfect and I felt was a little more realistic and had more depth to the story.<br /><br />There are MANY similarities in this book that resemble Fifty Shades but I loved this one much more. This one had more shock factor I think with the main conflict between Eva and Gideon over Ana and Christian. I just wish the names in this series had more appeal. I loved Eva's best friend, he was one of my favorite characters.<br /><br />I CANNOT WAIT until the next one comes out in the fall!!!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This game relaxes me :)<br />I love this game.<br />Its a game everyone should try. it is challenging and so fun to try to beat your own score.
1469984202|1.0|The reviews are overwhelmingly positive about his work, but I had trouble getting through much. I did finish it, but considered it a PWOT. The simplistic writing and continual dependence on emotional string tugging instead of story development was bad enough, but the implausibility of the silo environment and all the myriad points of just wrong science is the killer. I am a scientist by training and know many things about this kind of autarky and closed loop environment, especially heat transfer, air exchange, and hydroponics.  What was used as &#34;normal&#34; is totally unlikely in this story, especially as it alludes to hundreds of years in existence. Nothing is going to function for so long, even with frequent repairs and tons of spares. The tech level is clearly not sustainable without a corresponding mountain of spare parts for all the advanced machinery and consumables. For example, looking at the data processing capabilities and the grow lights depicted in this would not mean much to most. However, grow lights certainly do not last centuries, and even considering a minor miracle such as microwave powered calcium/sulfur dust lamps providing photosynthetic active radiation, the microwave magnetron would be junk after a decade. CPUs, DRAM, and hard drives are flaky even now, not to even consider centuries of use and repair. Current grow lamp technology such as sodium vapor and metal halide lamps would last a few years at most. LEDs are even shorter lived.  In addition, much is made of crops such as oats and fruit juice grown under hydroponics; that is simply not even remotely probable due to space limitations and the carbon fixing nature of the species used and maximum yield per unit of energy limitations, even imagining outlandish bio-engineering for productivity. The energy does not balance at all, and without incredible heat sinks, everyone in an enclosed silo would bake in short order, especially considering the apparently highly toxic outside air and the obvious lack of filtration to remove contaminants/absorb high energy radiation from particles.  If you didn't know, the huge Mall of the Americas in frigid Minneapolis is heated solely by the activity of electrical fixtures and the inhabitants walking around shopping.Imagine the energy using and  squandering depicted in this story and you realize with a tiny bit of physics and thermodynamics that it simply doesn't work out. This is not a science fiction novel; it may be a romantic relationship tale and if poorly cataloged by Amazon, then I apologize for being a pedant. I do not apologize for the infantile writing and boring nature of the story. Even if one ignores the technical impossibilities, the lame unskilled writing and boring nature of the story would not justify spending even a penny on this tripe.  UPDATE - Any moron reading this is obviously not graduating grammar school. This is terrible writing.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|All I can say is  blush  blush blush. This book was sultry and romantic. The author really knew how to keep its readers on the edge of their seat. A must read
B006RUJST6|5.0|I read this book in one sitting. I had my reserves about the book I feel like the first chapter started out slowly, but after those first few pages it picked up so fast I couldn't stop!<br /><br />I liked that this story was different. There is a few twists that I don't feel were predictable and loved the poetry in it. You really felt like you were there with the characters. I usually do not love poetry but this was entertaining. I felt the characters pain with the turn of events that happened. I cried 3 times in the book.<br /><br />You won't regret buying this one.
B005QUQRE2|5.0|Great price great movie; 'Another Earth' won the Alfred P. Sloan Prize at that 2011 Sundance Film Festival and received a standing ovation at the first screening. Positive thought-provoking science fiction at it's best, and  another hopeful ray of light for mankind's salvation in the fight for good -- 'against that day'.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love it!!! Was a great book. I could not put it down once I started.It's hard to find a great read and this was one .
B004T2QZL8|5.0|If you like spending money and poking things. Im over halfway done and i cant put it down, also reviews need to be at least 20 words or more. Baby diapers are awful
0345803507|1.0|If I tore out every page that had the word \\"mercurial\\" on it, I'd have a book with no pages. How could this have ever been published? It's insulting. There are actual entire phrases and sentence combos just copied and pasted throughout the book. Ex: \\"I look pale. But then again, I always look pale.\\". Is there really NO other way to have said that when trying to get the sentiment across. Even the sex became stale.<br /><br />My list of complaints of the series is endless. I did enjoy certain aspects of the book but overall I found the utter lack of talent, style or intelligence to be .... Kind of offensive. I'm just glad it's over and I can move on to something better.
1878424505|5.0|This item shipped quite quickly and arrived in excellent condition. This is a great book and well worth reading if you have not read it yet.I always have a good expierence when i use Amazon.
0345803485|1.0|Please don't waste your money on this book. After hearing many people go on about how wonderful this book was I finally gave in and read it, most of it anyway. I don't understand what everyone loves about the book,  I found it to be a really poorly written, depressing story. There is vitually no plot from beginning to 3/4 into the book where I finally gave up reading it completly disgusted. The story is about a naieve virgin who gets herself into an abusive, unhealthy relationship with a rich, oppresive, overbearing, stalker sadist, who won't even let her touch him, or have any normal semblance of a loving healthy relationship. Instead of realizing it as an unhealthy relationship this poor woman is so infatuated she lets him do anything to her, with her not gaining anything but heartbreak, loss, and a stalker in return. Most of the book is this woman thinking over her decision to stay with this guy, and sign a contract giving herself to him. It is the poster story for high school health class when you are warned about unhealthy relationships. There is a tedious amount of repition, plot wise, and with wording used. The \\"erotica\\" is just very depressing. overall a really horrible book that I wish I could un-read.
0345803507|1.0|DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!  After the novelty of the first or second time of sex in the first book, the rest of the story is lame, tedious, childish. I wanted to hit both characters, she for putting up with such nonsense (no orgasm is worth being treated like that), he for being an idiot out of another century. Finishing the series was kind of like watching a terrible accident-  you did not want to do it but could not stop yourself.  Thank goodness it was a nice sunny day to sit outside.  The suntan I got was the only decent thing I enjoyed in the last 100 pages.
0525425764|5.0|John Grisham is noted for legal thrillers such as \\"The Firm\\", \\"A Time To Kill\\", etc.  These books are geared towards adults.<br /><br />The last installment of the trilogy of the adventures of Theodore Boone is the book, \\"The Accused\\".  It reminds me a bit of Encyclopedia Brown but in a more contemporary sense.<br /><br />Theodore Boone's adventures are a thrilling and interesting story line.  It is geared towards kids but is just as compelling for adults.<br /><br />The hard cover version is reasonably priced at Amazon.<br /><br />JR Felisilda<br />Author of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\"
B007O4XX6S|4.0|The album has a fine combination of some classic Joe work with a more mature message. While it does not have the sound of his Barnstorm days, it is much stronger throughout than his last two solo albums. I have all of his work and this is a fine addition to that collection.
B004S49YEM|5.0|I read this book whilst on holidays in 2 days, it was so hard to put down.  It keeps you guessing until the end.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I love these puzzles and never knew where to find them other than puzzle books. Pleasantly surprised when this popped up as a FAOTD months ago and have played daily since!
B0034G4P80|5.0|I am happy I found this dvd.  I have been looking for it for a while. It came on time and it worked.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this app to take notes for sermons, at meetings, when I hear about something interesting, or whenever I need to remember something.  Simple to use,  simple to edit.  I like the color option ; it lets me easily group my memos.  2 thumbs way up.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Awesome calc app. I love it! Awesome calc app. I love it!<br /> Awesome calc app. I love it!  Awesome calc app. I love it!
B007RKPO84|5.0|Kreator has put three good albums lately, but this last one tops all three of them. The riffs, drums and vocals are outstanding. This is an awesome album. It has been in my car playing the moment I set foot in my car. So buy it, you wont be dissapointed.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I downloaded this game and I played it with the kids at my lunch table, the simple tap moves are wonderful, and if you are a beginner, it tells you if your move is invalid, by simply denying your piece movement. It automatically switches to your opponent when you are done, and it has the best graphics I've seen for a kindle Chess Game.<br /><br />Download it.
B0015AARJI|1.0|Save your money and buy official.  Bought from Wireovia and this piece of garbage broke inside of 1 hour of play.  I knew something was hinky so I opened it up and bam...all the signs are pointing to a counterfit.  Fake green battery, stickem to hold battery in place, controller actions were stiff, screw under the back sticker.<br /><br />IF YOU WANT TO SEE IF ITS FAKE, A QUICK LOOK UNDER THE STICKER WILL DO IT.  Official controllers don't have one, Fakes ones do.  Don't buy ANY controllers from them!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|These books kept popping up in my recommended list.  I finally caved and bought the series, and I'm very glad I did.  I throughly enjoyed the stories and the characters the author created.  I can still picture some of the scenes in my mind.  I will probably go back and read them again in the future.
B004GNFSO0|2.0|After reading the Book, I was anxious to see the movie.  The casting was not very good, and the movie did not have the same kind of excitment the book had. If I had not read the book I would not have known what was going on in the movie.  The product from my kindle however is what amazon was responsible for and the delivery was seemless.  Never have problems with the downloading.  Not amazon nor Kindles fault, but it was not a very good movie.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I got this for my kindle fire and it is light and fits great. Most of the time it stands in place when I'm watching a movie but once in a great while it does fall over.  But all in all I'm very happy with it.
B00005K3O4|4.0|When a college town falls under attack from a group of hideous, blood-sucking, Killer Klowns from Outer Space, a young couple team up with a steadfast cop and two goofball brothers to save the world from their deadly popcorn, pies, and cotton candy cocoons! This oddball cult-classic from MGM and the Chiodo Brothers does a great job balancing dark humor with general creepiness, and gotta love all the creative, practical effects! The movie has its cheese factor, I'd guess both intended and not, as it is a send-up to those classic monster movies of the 50's on what was probably an equally modest budget. Perhaps if it had been all-out comedy or all-out horror, it could have been even better, but considering the subject matter, the middle ground seems very appropriate and is very successful. Definitely a fun way to spend an evening, and some of these scenes you'll never forget (like the creepy scene in the burger place where one klown tries to lure off a little girl)! This is a movie you've gotta see at least once in your life!<br /><br />The Midnite Movies DVD release is great! There's an audio commentary with the chiodo brothers, deleted scenes, bloopers, a bunch of featurettes, galleries, the theatrical trailer... This is DVD the way it was meant to be! Great quality with a ton of bonus features! You'll be amazed at the detail that went into this film's many clever ideas! Definitely worth the purchase if you love this film, and if you've never seen it, you need to check it out!
B0074EIQUG|4.0|The Doctor is a living legend so I had high hopes for this album and was not disappointed. The influence of The Black Keys' Dan Auerbach (who produced and plays on all tracks) is heavy at times but positive overall and enough of Dr John's signature sound comes through. All songs are collaborations. The opening title track sets the rocky tone but there are spells in here too (as in \\"Eleggua\\"), swampy blues (\\"Ice Age\\") and even some gospel overtones (\\"God's Sure Good\\"). It's a triumphant return for the man and his mojo.
B004XXIHS2|5.0|This was a great book! It has all the elements of a classic.  I want to read more by this author.
0307592731|3.0|I enjoyed this book from a solo traveler's point of view. However, I didn't have very much respect for the author. Based on her drug use, promiscuity, adultery, unprotected sex, and an abortion to boot. She comes across to me as selfish and immature. In her defense, she does make acknowledgements of her transgressions but that is no excuse. Otherwise, it is a good read if you like the outdoors.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|The Lamberts are a typical young couple with three small children who have just moved into a beautiful new home. However, one of their little boys immediately becomes injured and falls into an apparent coma. Soon after, the family finds itself suffering from strange and terrifying occurrences. After the family moves in search of some peace, the events continue to occur. Mother-in-law is consulted and help is brought in, revealing a dark and insidious secret from Mr. Lambert's childhood that could be the key to saving his family today.<br /><br />Wow, what can I say about this movie?! When I saw it in theaters last year, I was blown away. It was EXCELLENT, and I don't say that lightly. A throwback to the great, supernatural horror films like Amityville, Poltergeist, The Exorcist, The Entity, Rosemary's Baby, and The Shining, \\"Insidious\\" is a truly fascinating and scary film! In fact, it instantly and easily became one of my favorite horror films from the first time I saw it. If you're looking for proof that recent horror films aren't all bad, I've got three masterpieces for you, and this is one of them. The other two are \\"Cabin in the Woods\\" and \\"The Mist\\", but I digress.<br /><br />A fine cast (including \\"The Entity\\" star Barbara Hershey) , some plot qualities we've never seen before, and some truly scary music and imagery make this film a cut above the rest, and I highly recommend it. Don't listen to nay-sayers who  describe the ending as too open or the film's demon as too Darth Maul-esque. There is nothing but win here. The demon is freaky and the Tip Toe Through the Tulips scene, ugh! Try getting that song and its creepiness out of your head after seeing this for the first time! I only hope the upcoming \\"Sinister\\" is this good!<br /><br />Now, the Blu-Ray bonus features are a bit underwhelming. There are 3 behind the scenes featurettes, that's pretty much it. They are good, but this film deserved so much more. However, if you love horror films, this movie belongs on your shelf, so I guess they get away with it this time. \\"Insidious\\" is a film you'll love introducing new people to all the time! Just don't watch it alone!s on your shelf, so I guess they get away with it this time. \\"Insidious\\" is a film you'll love introducing new people to all the time! Just don't watch it alone!

0062011847|5.0|Another fantastic novel from Sir Terry. I've heard some complain that it is too political, too dogmatic. Snuff portrays Vimes's character well, his beliefs are what makes the story. Discworld is no more free of prejudice than we are here and there's no reason to have to ignore it. Vimes has always and will always be against innocents suffering at the hands of others, if you don't understand that maybe you should go back and re-read the watch books before you start this one.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is the best of all the free games by far!!  no energy bar just continuous play! 5 out of 5!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is great! I played it for about an hour, although it has a slight lag when turning, the app is a great game.<br />I would, however, advise that you do the tutorial before playing, that should fix some problems.<br />I greatly appreciate Amazon putting this in the App Store for Kindle Fire, I have this on my Iphone and I love it, THANK YOU!<br />~AV

0062206281|5.0|At once a sequel to The Angel's Game and both a sequel and prequel to The Shadow of the Wind, The Prisoner of Heaven continues to tie together the twisting and melancholy narratives of David Mart&iacute;n and Daniel Sempere. This time, Zaf&oacute;n uses the unlikeliest of sources to accomplish this intertwining of narratives: at the heart of The Prisoner of Heaven, though not the titular prisoner itself, is Ferm&iacute;n Romero de Torres, and his story, from his first steps through the gates at Castle Montjuïc, to his eventual meeting with Daniel Sempere, is surprisingly heartbreaking and and important to the overall narrative of the series' overall story.<br /><br />In The Shadow of the Wind, Ferm&iacute;n's role as sidekick often fell into the role of comedic relief, allowing Zaf&oacute;n to break the tension with a well-timed joke about flatulence or an off-beat observation about the world, or those who people it. His place in the novel is important for helping to maintain tone, and showcasing Zaf&oacute;n's sly humour, but the reader always had the sense the Ferm&iacute;m's past held secrets as dark and interesting as anyone else in the novel. The Prisoner of Heaven explores some of those secrets, but not all. In response to Ferm&iacute;n's upcoming nuptiuals, Daniel sets out to ensure that his friend can be legally wed under his nom de plume, Ferm&iacute;n Romero de Torres, and in doing so discovers secrets about his own past and his connection with David Mart&iacute;n, lightly touched upon in The Angel's Game. It's a thrilling ride for anyone who has closely followed the labyrinth of relationships that Zaf&oacute;n has woven through his novels.<br /><br />One aspect that surprised me is how The Prisoner of Heaven makes The Angel's Game a stronger novel, by exploring David Mart&iacute;n from the perspective of an outsider. It's difficult to go into without digging deep into spoiler territory, which is not my objective for this review, but it sheds a lot of light on Mart&iacute;n's actions in The Angel's Game and explicitly explains the origins of his delusions, suggesting that the confusing narrative of The Angel's Game, often considered one of its flaws when considering it as a stand-alone novel, might serve a greater role in the series as a whole. I have one prediction for the final novel that, if it comes true, will be incredibly bold and perfectly executed by Zaf&oacute;n. Time will tell if I'm correct, but it will make subsequent re-reads of the entire series take on a new perspective.<br /><br />There are the familiar characters that we all met and grew to love in The Shadow of the Wind. Ferm&iacute;n, of course, plays an important role, as does Daniel, though his next time to truly shine will be in the following novel, but it was pleasent and nostalgic to again be re-introduced to Bea and Daniel's father, and Issac at the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, all of whom have grown up a bit, matured and evolved since we last saw them. Except Isaac; he never seems to change. And that's just fine.<br /><br />Barcelona, too, has changed since readers last visited, slowly crawling out from under the shadow of World War II and the civil war that wracked much of Spain through the latter-half of the '30s. Gone is the baroque and ethereal Barcelona, ripe for the lingering ghosts and haunted dreams that formed much of the core tale in The Shadow of the Wind, replaced with a more contemporary Barcelona, snow falling over the city, instead of sunshine bleaching its streets. Due to the dual-timeline structure of the narrative, Zaf&oacute;n is able to press these two visions of Barcelona together, illustrating the cities transformation through the intervening years between the `beginning' of Ferm&iacute;n's tale (1939) to the opening pages of this tale (1957). It's another touching love letter from Zaf&oacute;n to the City of Counts.<br /><br />The Prisoner of Heaven is a worthy follow-up to The Shadow of the Wind and everything I hoped The Angel's Game would be. It is not as deep or labyrinthine as The Shadow of the Wind, by virtue of its length, and it does not play tricks on the reader through a twisted, unreliable narrator like The Angel's Game (or does it?), but stands between the two of them as a strong novel that, while it doesn't stand entirely on its own, as the previous two novels did, appears to be the keystone novel in Zaf&oacute;n's series. Many questions are raised in The Prisoner of Heaven, pondering the relationship between the tales of Daniel Sempere and David Mart&iacute;n, and the final volume of the quartet, along with those answers, cannot come soon enough. The Prisoner of Heaven is a near pitch-perfect novel, and fans of The Shadow of the Wind have much to look forward to.ength, and it does not play tricks on the reader through a twisted, unreliable narrator like The Angel's Game (or does it?), but stands between the two of them as a strong novel that, while it doesn't stand entirely on its own, as the previous two novels did, appears to be the keystone novel in Zafón's series.

B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is cool and very addicting.  ive never had it tweek out either.  so the mechanics must be good.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This coming from a progressive fan, I find this album to have great song writing, variety, and the classic Chris Cornell sound. Great stuff.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is amazing. I loved it on the ipad and I love it on the kindle. I reccomend this game to anyone who liked fun.
B007X4ECMI|5.0|Do not judge this movie off \\"reviews\\" that you read from others. Judge it off your own experience. As all movies should be. Give it a chance. I typically laugh when other people talk \\"shit\\" on a movie that they themselves do not like. This is not like any action movie. A guy (Guy Pierce) must save the pres. daughter from a prison in space that all dirt bags got loose on and now the prison is falling out of space.... epic. epic story line in deed.
B007SGM084|4.0|I was told about this book by a couple of my friends. I am in my early 30s, so when I heard about this I instantly thought about the paper back books my grandmother reads with the busty woman and the outlaw type man on the cover. No way is this going to be any good. SO that night I downloaded it to my ipad kindle reader. I read all 3 books in a week and a half. The first book was done in 2 days. I will admit, the sex parts got a little old after a while but I found my self wanting to learn more about Christian and how he became the way he was. I was not impressed at all with the end and I believe it could have been written a little better. The writer uses the same words over and over.<br /><br />I have recommended this book to several coworkers. Would be a book I will read again one day
B002SG8A56|5.0|Love the show, love the deal. Got this deal for less than the new package their selling of the complete collection with seasons 1 and 2 combined. It's a great show, meant for music lovers with a dry sense of humor! Gotta love it.
B007XHWROK|4.0|Can't say I'm disappointed either! This album is pretty hip. I've actually grown to like Bieber a lot but this album makes me love him and his music a lot more. This disc is a mix of pop, dance pop and R&B with an occasional urban edge. If you had doubts before, I would check this one out this time around. Might surprise you!<br /><br />I'm glad when I first saw Usher's album at Wal-Mart that I didn't get it quite yet. Because I'm sure this album is better. It's extremely solid-sounding and none of the tracks are bad filler (although \\"Die In Your Arms\\" and its back up singers may be too cutesy for some).<br /><br />Bieber has put out quality music before this with great pop, R&B and hip-hop beats but those songs generally had a cutesy tinge. Most of that is gone here. His voice has deepened too. More mature. And it makes a difference. Don't get me wrong though--I like old and new Justin Bieber. But if I was asked on what I prefer, I prefer that his music sound like this. \\"Boyfriend\\" was the first song that featured a hip new sound and deeper vocals, \\"Catching Feelings\\" is very R&B and has writing credits from the legendary Babyface who also wrote on Beyonc&eacute;'s \\"Best Thing I Never Had\\" single, \\"Right Here\\" with Drake is another excellent R&B song that features one of the hottest beats on the album and \\"Believe\\" is an ode to love and how it can be inspiring, backed with a gospel choir and all. Excelente!<br /><br />4.4 stars.<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />\\"Catching Feelings\\"<br />\\"Right Here\\"<br />\\"Die In Your Arms\\" &<br />\\"Beauty And A Beat\\"
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|_better than the original. I wish all app games were this much fun. I could play all day if it was feasible.
B0071LLHGC|5.0|well no i do not think this is as good as fillmore east. i do however think it is a first class recording of the band. kinda like being front row and catching it all. you can hear dickie has a bit of a problem w/ his guitar on\\"hot lanta\\" and comes in a little late. also the bass line on that song is not like the fillmore version (one of my all time favorite live bass runs). no way am i knocking it. if fillmore east did not exist, this might be the one to step up and take its place.
B008578PRK|1.0|this movie totally SUCKED big time...it's a waste of time and money. I couldn't stay awake to save my life.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Very addictive. Now that my kitchen is growing, I find myself cooking first thing in the morning so food will be ready by the time I get home from work. Sometimes this is very thought provoking, as I come up with strategies to keep customers happy while making money. Just simply a really cool app.
B007Y1ARLA|5.0|I have really enjoyed this album.  I have listened to it multiple times at work and played it for other people to hear.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Here's a product that is worthy of the work it represents. Excellent packaging, production and quantity of the available material inside. Only high quality productions like this anthology, can do justice to the series that have marked the late 20th century Sci-Fi in such powerful way that no other attempt in this field has yet matched it. If you like suspense, monsters and chill of the Space, this anthology will be more than you need. If you don't, just watch Sigourney Weaver - I myself cannot get enough of her beauty and presence.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The story was amazing.  I went through all the emotions while reading it!  I didn't want the story to end.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|was cool just kinda hard getting the coins but all in all it was a cool game me and my girl play it a lot.
B007QNRMUU|5.0|I have always enjoyed Jason Mraz's music.  He never seems to let me down and he hasn't with this album either.  XOXOXo

0439023483|5.0| it! amazing book, action, adventure, i enjoyed every minute of it, haven't seen the movie yet, but heard both r good, all my friends told me to read this
B007X4N0DU|5.0|This CD is the essence of P.O.D. Heavy, melodic, and pretty much something for everyone. For me, the best songs on the album are Murdered Love, West Coast Rock Steady, Babylon the Murderer, Eyez, and I Am.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Amazing Game! I play it constantly just to pass the time. Me and my brother even play it keeps me busy
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found this book via the Kindle store after hearing Robb Wolf mention it on his podcast.<br /><br />I'm not going to write a lengthy review. Suffice to say that I've never written an Amazon review before, and I've been reading science fiction avidly since I was a kid (I'm 33). My all-time favorite series is Dan Simmons' \\"Hyperion Cantos\\". If this series continues to develop in such a great fashion, this will sit comfortably at #2.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I've enjoyed reading all of Mr. Baldacci's novels, and this is the best yet.  It was my first Kindle purchase.  With the advanced \\"page turning,\\" I was able to read this riveting novel in no time.  The plot is different; the action is non-stop; and the characters are mesmerizing. Can't wait for the next one.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|ok I have a kindle fire and the flashlight and it  doesn't work you guy r wrong sorryy I love the flashlight on the kindle fire
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have a good time playing the game but the ads get loud &amp; annoying after a while. I haven't won a game on random deal yet but that might just be a skill error.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|really fun but you have to either wait a really long time between turns or pay real money. no way am i paying a penny for this. so I can only play for 5 minutes at a time :(
B0086700CM|1.0|Oh my God. These app creators are idiots. When I downloaded this, my kindle fire was fully charged. after download, when I started to play this app, all of a sudden, 13% of battery is left. What the heck???!!! And I stilled played, constustnly 13% BATTERY LEFT 13% BATTERY LEFT, everytime clicked dismiss, it came back up. UNISTALL!! Also I saw the. comment saying don't belive the people with 5 stars. Yes, you can belive them. they probaly just have better connection or a better phone cause I downloaded this on my Andriod and it was fine. nothing wrong with it. then,  my Aneroid crashed. Idk if it was my 2 yr old brother who broke it b/c he was playing with it all morning long or it was this game. best guess it was my brother but its posible that it was this game. I hate this game. I wish before I downloaded this,  I checked the reviews cause I didn't check them, next time for a game I'm checking the reviews!!
B005DD7H50|5.0|An unsuccessful writer takes a smart pill that lets him access the unused corners of his brain. The drug leads to all sorts of problems, including addiction, lost time, withdrawal, involvement with thuggish criminals and rogue corporate elements, not to mention the issues the drug creates with the writer's girlfriend. Fortunately, being super-smart helps the writer navigate his way through these perils.<br /><br />Limitless is stylish, smart, cynical, twisted, and engrossing, filled with energetic action and gore that works seamlessly into a well-conceived story. Some spectacular visuals kept my eyes glued to the screen. The performances are all strong, but it's great to see DeNiro give a surprisingly subtle performance in a supporting role. There was nothing about this movie I didn't like. 4 1/2 stars.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This is a great Movie! I have NO complaints about it.  I actually gave it<br />as a gift to a family member for Christmas.

B000002HH9|3.0|Over the years this album has received a lot of flack. Overall, it's underrated despite its shortcomings. The music scene had changed in four years, the time between \\"Wish\\" and \\"Wild Mood Swings\\", as did the Cure. The line up was in limbo, as Smith had just recovered from a legal battle with former member Lol Tolhurst. Grunge had eaten its way through the mainstream conscience, and subsequently killed off many of the great acts of the previous decade.....or significantly decreased their relevance in the then new musical landscape. This was already the Post Grunge era, 1996. Siouxsie and the Banshees disbanded, but ironically the Sex Pistols reunited. And in the midst of all this the Cure were about to defy the odds and not go under after losing key members Porl Thompson and Boris Williams....Hence the birth of \\"Wild Mood Swings\\"; The controversial rebirth of the Cure.<br /><br />  The first misconception of \\"WMS\\" is that it is a happy album; It is not entirely. Like many Cure releases it is eclectic in mood, hence the title. \\"Want\\" is a very epic and dark opener, and one of the best Cure songs ever written. With this intro you would think The Cure had reawakened like a sleeping giant until the pointless misfire of \\"Club America\\" so soon leads the album astray. And then \\"This Is A Lie\\" makes a remarkable recovery and gets the album back on track. \\"The 13th\\" is a silly affair, but I still find it an intriguing and fun track. The Latin flavor is seldom used in the Cure, and the last time I can recall that spice was \\"The Blood\\" from 1985's \\"Head On The Door\\".<br /><br />  \\"Strange Attraction\\" is their poppiest moment, both lyrically clever and colorful. \\"Mint Car\\" begins to tip the scale in terms of the \\"happy\\" element because it is so blatant. This is where those misconceptions start. I also always disagreed this song being released as a single. It's not terrible by any means, but it's also not challenging like their previous pop outings such as \\"Lovecats\\" and \\"Close To Me\\". The somber \\"Jupiter Crash\\" takes the record on another detour, followed by another course correction, \\"Round & Round & Round\\", lyrics that remind me of the club life social rut and its shallow tendencies. \\"Gone\\" drags its feet out of bed, but is somehow playful and endearing.<br /><br />  \\"Numb\\" is thoughtful yet dreary, but by no means a bad song either. Again the erratic \\"WMS\\" rollercoaster spirals into yet another loop as \\"Return\\" picks it back up, but it's not until \\"Trap\\" that Robert snaps into an angst not heard since the beginning of the album, and it is a fine Rock number indeed. \\"Treasure\\" is a beautiful and bittersweet come down as \\"WMS\\" is about to close shop with the final track \\"Bare\\". At this point the listener is left exhausted by all the twists, turns, and detours laid down on its course, and I'd say at moments nearing derailment. The closer (\\"Bare\\") is not one of the strongest Cure songs. It almost feels like Robert and company are straining to find any real ounce of emotion left as they are running out of steam....The melancholy words and such seem almost contrived. The album's conclusion is anti-climatic. Although variety is always welcomed, the album lacks focus. It's also not as adventurous as the delirious \\"Top\\" album despite the common thread of both being mixed bags.<br /><br />  \\"WMS\\" is a departure from any previous era of the band. The album was recorded in a house as opposed to a regular studio. This situation introduced an intimacy that is yet to be found before or after this release. The recording quality and production is unique for a Cure album, I'll admit. The use of horns and orchestral arrangements are reminiscent of \\"Kiss Me Kiss Kiss Me\\", yet both characteristics still lend a distinctiveness of their own to this album. If anything, the use of these elements, only add to the degree of intimacy that helps define \\"WMS\\". It's one of the album's strengths, intentional or not. It's almost enough to counteract some of the weakersongs.<br /><br />  Many uncertainties within the band seem to have been the backdrop of the making of this record. It was the longest gap between Cure albums. When the skies were finally clear again for the group something different took shape. This is drummer Jason Cooper's debut, and the return of keyboardist Roger O'Donnell who had not been present in the line up since \\"Disintegration\\". \\"WMS\\" marks the beginning of not only a new line up for the Cure, but a new era. The Cure had returned, however taken a slight fall from the success of \\"Wish\\". \\"WMS\\" is nowhere near a perfect Cure album, but it is probably their most misunderstood body of work. Given the circumstances surrounding the album, I'd say they could've done much much worse. When the epitaph for the band is written, \\"WMS\\" should be remembered  as a transitional marquee for the group; One that was struggling to find its place again in a music scene that is constantly changing, erratic and unpredictable.......Much like the record itself.

B005EGXTL2|4.0|I was a bit disappointed in Catching Fire, which I felt was far too much of a retread of the original Hunger Games novel.  This third instalment, Mockingjay, was much more interesting.  It seemed more serious and was definitely more political than the previous instalments.  It's also pretty gruesome in parts, which makes me wonder how they will manage to film this one. It benefitted from new locations. I suspect the ending won't be to everyone's taste, but I liked it - I felt it was quite a 'real' way to tie things up

B0053JJLLC|2.0|I was so excited to get the latest Michael Crichton book and what I can only assume will be his last.  I knew that it was written in party by Crichton and in part by someone who finished an unfinished manuscript but the James Rollins review convinced me to get it.  I think Mr. Rollins must have read another book.  This is nothing like Congo aside from sticking a handful of people in a \\"jungle\\" and having a one word title, that's where the similarities end.  It was terrible.  The dialog was terrible.  The narration made me want to drive a pencil into my brain.  I'm not sure if it's OK to actually type out sentences from the book but let me just say that there was a sentence that began and ended with the word \\"generally\\".  Yeah, sad but true.  It was just painful to read. I can't count the number of times I actually said out loud \\"Are you freaking kidding me?\\" while reading this book.<br /><br />Sadly I read the reader reviews after I got halfway into the book.  I wish I had read them before but I jumped on this purchase almost as soon as it was available so there really weren't any reader reviews to read.  One of the reviews said they wondered if Crichton started writing it, realized how bad it was and then stopped and locked it in a trunk hoping no one would ever find it.  Others said they wondered if he had written anything more than the title on a cocktail napkin.  It breaks my heart thinking that this book is going to be part of his legacy.  His estate really did him a disservice when they allowed this to be published.  Even after realizing how bad it was and reading the reviews that indicated it would not get better, I forged on and refused to give up.  It only got worse.<br /><br />I think the final indication of how bad this book was came when I reached the end.  Ordinarily I care about the characters in the books I read, I wonder what happens next, I wish that the book would continue on.  When I got to the end of this book I couldn't have cared less about theremaining characters.

0307352145|5.0|This is a very well researched and well written book. It's got great anecdotes about people who are introverts and also shy people. It includes lots of research from psychology, sociology and other social and medical sciences about introversion and associated personality types such as shyness, sensitivity and so forth.<br /><br />The author has a very good grasp of the many aspects of introversion from a scientific point of view (draws on a huge body of studies) and also a more personal perspective too. Cain has suffered through societies marginalization of introverts because she herself is introverted and because she is also extremely observant (a trait common in introverts) her insights into the experiences of people like her are highly valuable. Her understanding of the research is impeccable as far as I could tell (which is a testament to her skills, intelligence and care as a researcher because her formal area of expertise is the law, not social science).<br /><br />The greatest contribution I think this thorough book will do for introverts will be the acceptance from introverts of their own personality trait and see it as a value instead of a burden. Society will also benefit immensely from acceptance in seeing introverts not as having a disorder and in need to be treated but as people that are part of the beautiful mosaic that make up human personalities. By ignoring introverts or marginalizing them, society does itself a huge disfavor because introverts are some of the greatest human capital we have with their creativity, open-mindedness, sensitivity and compassion. She painstakingly describes the areas in which introverts have made massive positive impacts on society and also describes many salient instances of how when their voices are drowned out by the din of extrovert-biased society, significant detriment to the world results (the recent global financial collapse is one such example).<br /><br />I think this book has a good chance to be a paradigm changer in how society treats introverts. It took 5 years to write it but I think readers will clearly see the effort, care and thoroughness Cain has invested. The rest of the world need to stop blabbering and be silent for a moment and listen to introverts. They can start by reading this book.<br /><br />However, just a quick note: I have the kindle version and unfortunately, most of the notes (and citations) have not been linked to the body of the text. There's a note section in the back but I cannot get to it from the body of the text because the hypertext links has not been added. This is a problem with kindle, however, not with the content of the book and I hope kindle will fix this problem ASAP.
B00846REIS|4.0|After just finishing Bared to You, I found myself jonesing to write down my thoughts on the \\"provocative\\" read.  Typically drawn to more academic books/classics, I decided to spice up my summer with jumping on the 50 Shades bandwagon and read the whole trilogy.  And Bared to You, from the characters to the cover, is obviously a 50 Shades piggy back ride.  With that in mind, I have to address a few elements of 50 in order to justly review Day's latest. While the actual writing of 50 Shades was appalling in many spots (seriously, how many times can one \\"clamber?\\", did James forget that people don't \\"fetch\\" the phone in America, and don't get me started on Ana's underdeveloped eating disorder...), but with that being said, I FELT the characters.  I felt Christian's trauma and understood his need for control.  I felt Ana's naivete and willingness to make allowances because of her need for Christian.  I felt their attraction/need/desire for each other.  All their romping and various other bedroom/red room of pain/hotel acts made sense to me.  They added to the story.  Heck, I even understood Kate's character change throughout the series, and she was merely a supporting character.  Despite all of the flaws in James's virgin novel (pun intended), I still think she did a better job at creating a raw story line than seasoned author Sylvia Day, though Day's story is not to be discarded.<br /><br />***Note, MINOR spoilers ahead.  Nothing that should detract from your reading, but a few casual mentions of plot throughout***<br />Let's start with some positives...<br />Writing style:<br />Day is a veteran and professional author.  One look at the sheer number of books she's written and one can see she churns books out like butter.  She knows what she is doing...no doubt about that.  Bared to You vastly benefits from the professional writing.  The description in on point.  The action is well fleshed out.  The dialogue is realistic.  And repetition is minimal.  I didn't find myself cringing over amateur writing or rolling my eyes as a new word was used and then used again, and then again, as I did in James's novels.  Kudos to Day for excellent command of the written word.<br /><br />Setting:<br />Day obviously knows/understands New York City.  She doesn't spend pages and pages devoted to describing every detail of everything around (yawn), but she does give enough glimmers to make us believe she's familiar.  Night clubs, lounges, restaurants, even penthouse buildings all fit the bill for upscale Manhattan.<br /><br />Character development through dialogue:<br />I thought that the communication between Eva and Gideon was impeccable.  The characters seemed so REAL in the moments when they were going back and forth between their various issues and discussing strategies to attempt to move on.  I thought Day captured the real ebb and flow of relationship discussion in these pages.  Eva came across as someone who had obviously sought and used therapy and understood her issues to a tee, while Gideon was effectively painted as the character not quite as familiar with his own trauma.  Despite Eva's understanding of her triggers, etc., she didn't always do the \\"right\\" or \\"logical\\" thing, adding to the realism of the situation.  How many times do we think, \\"This is not a good idea\\" before making a decision, but do it anyway?  I definitely connected with the characters during their conversations more than any other time in the book.<br /><br />Possession:<br />Some reviewers have complained that Gideon's behavior is \\"stalker\\" and way unacceptable.  I didn't so much have a problem with that.  Yes, 21 missed calls in a 30 minute time span is a lot.  But, it's frantic, as was he.  Checking into someone's life without their permission might seem invasive, but come on, we live in a world of facebook, twitter, linkedin, google, etc.  With so many ways to gain information, cyber-stalking has become almost par for the 20-something crowd.  I know I've been guilty... As far as the flowers (if you haven't read, you'll understand if you do) I thought they were sweet.  She was trying to achieve an emotion in Gideon that she thought would help him and she went for it.  I didn't have a problem with this.<br /><br />Side characters:<br />While one reviewer criticized Day for providing a cast of physically perfect characters, I didn't have a problem with this.  We are in the socialite, upscale world of Manhattan after all.  One need only turn on Real Housewives of ___________ to determine that with a lot of wealth comes a lot of \\"beauty.\\"  I thought Day did a great job of capturing the selfish/caring vision of Eva's mom by realistically painting her as feeling like the \\"victim\\" in a situation even though she didn't suffer the actual trauma.  I thought Eva's reactions to her hyper-protective tendencies further enhanced the mother daughter dynamic.  I also felt like Cary is a character with quite a bit of intrigue left.  I hope Day shares with us more about his past.<br /><br />Some Issues...<br />Gideon and Eva:<br />While the dialogue of these two is excellent, I somehow missed their magnetic connection.  I felt like Day skipped over a few key parts of any relationship development (even jaw-dropping, love-at-first-sight ones.)  It seems to me like E and G went from electric chance meeting in the lobby to indecent proposal to total, intimate love-making in a limo.  I'm not sure I believed it.  As their relationship went on, I just decided to forego my doubts of the timeline and immediate falling in love and pretend they had developed more realistically as a couple.  This allowed me to better \\"get\\" their relationship throughout.<br /><br />Sexual Abuse Pasts:<br />I thought Day painted Eva in a mature and realistic way, as I've already said.  I believed her past.  I believed her internal dialogue as she clinically recognized triggers and appropriate/inappropriate responses, and I thought Day did a service to women by creating an abuse survivor who had a strong handle on herself and her surroundings.  There are very few times when Eva acts victimized, and even in those moments, she shows strength.  Gideon, on the other hand, is another story.  I didn't feel like his trauma was developed at all!  Now I know that we haven't even gotten the tip of the iceberg with his past, but it seemed like his \\"need\\" for control, his preference for brunettes, and his aversion to his childhood home are all said to be there, but I didn't see Day adhering to the writer's mantra of \\"show don't tell.\\"  Other than a few poignant night traumas, I didn't believe Gideon's issues like I did Eva's.  I hope that Day will improve this throughout the series.  For all of James's faults, I definitely believed Christian as a flawed character.<br /><br />Sex:<br />The sex scenes were fine.  I didn't think they did a whole lot to add to the story, but they also weren't gross or overly repetitive.  I mean, it's not normal for someone to have \\"a handful of orgasms,\\" but again, we don't want to read stories about people who have nice, average, loving sex 1-2 times a week as many/most married couples do.  This is, afterall, an escape from reality.<br /><br />Over-the-top:<br />This is a bit nitpicky, but the last issue I want to throw out there is the sheer over-the-topness of Gideon.  He is CONSTANTLY described as the most perfect, hot, sexy, fit, blah blah blah man EVER, but we don't really see him using his power in the business world like we did with Christian.  Finally, I thought Day could have better made us believe that he's a billionaire.  We don't really know how he made his money.  If he were 40 years old, then fine, we can assume he developed into a financier over time and there wouldn't be as big of a need to understand his success.  But he is 28 years old.  That means that in 6 years (assuming he was 22 when he graduated from Columbia) he has made $12 BILLION.  Oh, and in that time he's managed to buy a hotel, a chain ofgyms, at least one high end apartment building, at least two nightclubs, a majority party of a record company, oh and a huge luxury office building that is well over 20 stories high.  This is where his character somewhat fell apart for me.  I get the fantasy of the rich playboy.  I get that this is a romance novel and that no one wants to read the story of two average, middle-class people who fall in love and do average, middle-class things.  BUT, Day could have at least tried to let us believe Gideon's wealth by either toning it down a bit, or giving us more insight to his success.  Knowing he came from money, even giving some background that maybe he inherited a trust that got him started, etc. etc. would have been better than, \\"he has a really strong work ethic and as consequently bought half of Manhattan.\\"  This definitely caused some eye rolling on my end.  While Christian's wealth is no less over-the-top, James at least attempted to give us some clarity on how it was accumulated.<br /><br />Overall:<br />I like this book.  I will probably read the next two and hope that some of the issues resolve.  I just didn't have the same WOWSA, Best Book Ever! reactions that many reviewers did, and while I thought the writing was better, I still found myself thinking Eva and Gideon's relationship is a poor man's substitute to Ana and Christian's relationship.  Yes Eva is a better female lead.  Yes Christian is a better male lead.  Now, I just wonder what would happen if the two of them got together...

Never have I read a book with such awful trash for characters; they were all impulsive, irrational, and disrespectful.  The plot jumped around with little explanation and the book was unnecessarily long. i cannot believe this piece of garbage has such good reviews.  Number 8 best seller?? I am angry I wasted $3.

0307592731|4.0|What appealed to me is the expressiveness of this author regarding the death of her mother.  My mother, too, died when I was in my early twenties.  I still can not find words to express my sorrow and grief.  It hits me every single day in a million ways.<br /><br />Cheryl Strayed managed to say what is in my heart about that experience.  More than half of the novel is devoted to this death and its aftermath.  If my own voice was as strong as Strayed, then I would probably be so much more emotionally healthy.<br /><br />I can see how certain readers might became frustrated with Strayed's life reflections, which dominate the wilderness survival adventure story.  Yet, despite the trips down memory lane, the heroin use, and the horrible death of pet horse, I was affected by this novel.  It will make me think and evaluate my life experiences.

B006LSZECO|3.0|This was a great story but the ending was a huge, huge disappointment.  I felt like I wasted my time and that the author should have given readers some definitive type of closure by seeing justice done.  Like I said, it was a great story and I was riveted, but the one thing I absolutely hated about the writing was the author's gross overuse of parenthetical phrases.  I don't mind them in little doses, but practically every paragraph had something in parenthesis, which was so, so distracting.  I ending up skipping over every one of them, which just goes to show they weren't needed.  This book would have been half as many pages if the parentheticals had been eliminated.

B0041KKYGU|3.0|As a comedy the movie does contain some genuine laugh-out-loud moments. However, anyone who was not terribly impressed with the commercials should be forewarned that the film is equally unimpressive. We begin with Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz,) a beauty who is beginning to feel her youth slipping away, and who attempts to fill the void in her life through drugs and shopping. Teaching was a profession which she fell into more so than anything, and consequently her attitude toward education is one of apathy. After a rocky beginning (her husband and his mother kick Elizabeth out of the house) she finds herself trading a sports car for a rice burner, as she drive drives back to JAMS (John Adams Middle School,) where, ironically enough, she had quit teaching three months before, having only been there for a year. Needless to say, her return to JAMS is not exactly thrilling to Elizabeth. She begins showing random movies which have class room scenes but which contain no educational qualities; all the while she is slumped on the side of her desk sleeping or using marijuana, or gazing with lusty eyes at the enlarged breasts of a supermodel. She herself, by the way, is squeezing every penny in the hopes having the operation done on her, which includes almost embezzling money from the middle school car wash.<br /><br />It doesn't take long for a zany teacher named Amy Squirrel to get on Elizabeth's bad side, with superficially cutesy but threatening comments like \\"I know that last year you skated by doing the who 'bare minimum thing...' but this year I just know we'll be more than across-the-hall-mates.\\" One the one hand, Amy is a stereotypical Hollywood portrayed educator who uses touchy-freely talk to work out problems and help students. Being somewhat eccentric, however, she treats faculty in much the same way that she treats her students, a fact which Elizabeth, who is brisk and businesslike, quickly comes to resent. What's more, Amy has a dark side, and underneath her I-feel-your-pain sympathies is a fiercely competitive and somewhat mentally unhinged teacher. Curiously enough, despite their very different world views, the two have in common their strong will and ruthless, Machiavellian methods of making each other miserable and using every one else as pones to undermine each other. So when a substitute math teacher Scott Delacourte (Justin Timberlake) who also happens to come from a well-to-do family in the watch making business, a classic romance triangle forms and the two women try everything to win him over. Scott himself is an offbeat character, embodying certain feminine features which, when played by Timberlake, are both  amusing and down right disturbing. Additionally Scott is weak and easily swayed, thus allowing for plenty of manipulation by both Amy and Elizabeth. On the outside of the triangle is Russel Gettis (Jason Segel,) a gym teacher at JAMS who, despite his crude comments and stalker-esque behavior, actually has feelings for Elizabeth, as is later shown by the fact that he thinks her body is just fine and that she doesn't need the operation to make her look beautiful.<br /><br />Elizabeth gets into plenty of sticky situations throughout the school year which will give the audience something to laugh about, including stealing Amy's theater class Little Orphan Annie wig and pretending to be a reporter to gain access to the forthcoming state scholastic tests (and getting a state official drunk,) speeding out of the school parking lot while blaring Black Sabbath, rubbing poison oak on an apple as a \\"gift\\" for Amy, and much more. Additionally, she wears, as Amy says \\"provacative beach ware,\\" to the middle car wash, looking like one of the beauties posing for Sports Illustrated more than a teacher at a car wash. We also meet an assortment of other characters, including Elizabeth's odd roommate who she later uses to blackmail the aforementioned state official. There is also the JAMS principal, who has a special place inhis heart (and office!) for all things dolphin, thus playing on the stereotype of the progressive, bleeding heart principal.<br /><br />Yet, as with all somewhat substantive comedies, the movie has its heartfelt moments, too, echoing the same limited substance of the American Pie franchise in its both tender and serious moments. We see that there are times when Elizabeth feels a connection with some of her students, particularly near the end of the movie, in which we see that she isn't a bad apple after all, despite her shortcomings and bad choices in so many areas. In her own way, she brings her own brand of realism to the table, helping some of the kids re-assess themselves. One of her students, Sasha, is a people-pleaser whose parents pressure her and desire that she aspire to high political office. Though Elizabeth's advice that Sasha should look into massage therapy instead is a bit heavy-handed, uncalled for, and cynical, the scene demonstrates Elizabeth's sense regarding the differences between hopes and dreams on the one hand, and real prospects on the other. Another example in which demonstrates she is not altogether apathetic about her students is seen in her lecture to one of the boys who has had an unrequited and hopeless crush on a classmate, Chance. It is here, perhaps for the first time, that Elizabeth demonstrates a disgust for her own superficial attempts to land marriage and money with Scott. She sees in herself the egoism of Chance, and she admonishes the male student to look for someone who can really appreciate his sensitive soul and interest in poetry. Additionally, about halfway through the school year she learns of a scheme to make her breast augmentation dreams a reality, via the teacher's bonus competition which comes from student's getting the highest scores on the annual state test. In one of the more touching elements about this film, we see an ever so subtle shift in Elizabeth's priorities as her interest becomes one of actually educating students rather than merely going through the motions.A final showdown with Amy occurs, and there are plenty of laughs to be had with that alone.<br /><br />But all and all the movie was not successful. The acting was a up to par as one can expect from comedies, and Cameron Diaz really played her role well. But as a whole, while the movie did contain some redeeming elements, most viewers will find the unorthodox behavior and pervasive foul language use of the teachers in front of their students, simply too much. There is a scene in which Elizabeth writes \\"stupid\\" on some papers, and while this will arouse laughter from some quarters, others will not be so amused. One final interesting aspect of the movie is that it is a parody in some ways of the American school system. Pperhaps well apart from the intentions of its creators, it shows that despite the cliche idea of teachers as nurturing, progressive, and altruistic, they are often regular people who gripe about going to the office, are self-interested, and look to break up the monotony in life by resorting to the very juvenile behavior they are thought to be above.<br /><br />Bad Teacher gets a C+ from me.

B007WFR1MQ|3.0|My first douse was 'Obsolete' before that i had never experienced anything like it. What really got me into Fear Factory was their cerebral concepts and their way of presenting it. 2005 was a sad year for Fear Factory, they released (in my opinion) by far their least inspiring piece of work to date \\"Transgression'.<br /><br />Fear Factory fans had to wait 5 years to see the return of their favorite Cyber/Industrial Metal band and the wait was not in vein. They came back and wanted everyone to know that they were back! 'Mechanize' (2010) was such an amazing record, it was without the contributions of Raymond (Drums) & Chris (Guitars) and to be honest with you, i let out the loudest cry ever when i read that Raymond was out of the group! His drumwork had always been inspiring and powerful, not that Genes work went unoticed or ignored. I just loved Raymond's sound/style.<br /><br />Two years later 'The Industrialist' is upon us! According to Burton C. Bell (Vocals) This record was going to be more 'Cerebral' then that of 'Mechanize'. In my Strong Opinion, your concept album is only half as good, half as 'Cerebral' if it can deliver some Heart Pounding music. 'The Industrialist' lacks Focus and a constant Flow of Energy! YES! there are some 'HOLY S#$T!' tracks on here: The Industrialist, Recharger, Virus of Faith, Depraved Mind Murder & Lanfill (Bonus Track)<br /><br />The Samples/Effects are still here, but there not as LOUD as they were in the past (Demanufacture - Digimortal). Burton has been Blessed with his Vocals. That was truly the selling point for me when i got into this band. I know for a fact that he is easily capable of much, much more! The Production on the record has a tighter sound and I LOVE how i can make out every instrument on 'The Industrialist'<br /><br />Overall no big complaints, i still feel that Fear Factory can deliver a true Cyber/Industrial Masterpiece! Oh well, maybe next time Right? 'The Industrialist' 3 / 5. A solid release, but in the end it feels like you just want more from the band that created: Demanufacture & Obsolete ..... :(it feels like you just want more from the band that created: Demanufacture & Obsolete ..... :(

B002N2K328|5.0|Starts off with Booth back to work, and a whimsical Cindi Lauper telling Brenn's fortune.  Lots of focus on romance and Booth is a hero again saving Bren with guns blazing. Its got everything and ties up the series to date. One of my top 3 favorite  episodes, along with Booth and Brens real first case, and virus in a blizzard. Highly recommended.

0060558121|4.0|sometime you come upon a story that strums all the right strings in your soul.<br />I guess this is one such story for me.<br />Admittedly just about every story by Neil Gaiman that I've read has had this similar effect on me.<br />The American Gods stands out even among his works.<br />There is something familiar about all the characters, something everyday. God or demigod or mythical creature. We do see them on the commute, and at the store, or live next door to them. Their story is both glorious and sad, terrifying and comical, and rings true even if it's just a modern day fairy tale.
B007V80WUC|4.0|So with such a title, what is this album lacking (a bit) compared to the 2 previous installments? An epic song of 15-20 min (like the first chapter and Mouth of Madness) and an instrumental where they would really go bonkers (like Biosfear and Sane No More).<br /><br />I also regret that some of the songs are really too much on the pop side (Game of Life / Reach within / I am), and not more prog, but that's personal. And trust me, it is still good pop, and they serve you fantastic solos on the side. To be picky, I also don't dig the saturated vocals on the beginning of Namaste, but it did not spoil the song for me so that's fine.<br /><br />Other than that, it's still Circus Maximus, so expect to find fantastic vocals, blow-your-mind musicianship and crazy solos. 4 stars to me, it's still above many prog. bands and they have a sense of melody that I just love. Thank you CM for this really good 3rd album, and I hope the 4th one will follow soon!
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book reads quickly and the mysteries are well-contrived. But I didn't care one bit for the characters and I didn't enjoy feeling manipulated by the author as the characters' voices shift back and forth so in one chapter you are being urged to like someone and in the next urged to dislike them. And I really didn't care about what happened to them in the end. Actually reading this book made me wnat to go and write reviews of the Tana French novels I have been reading that create much more believable, complex and ultimately sympathetic characters.
0345803485|1.0|When I finished this book I was angry.  I could not believe that my book club chose this book.  Apparently there are people who loved this book.  I can imagine some spouses benefitted from this book.  You can open the book to any page and find a sex scene.<br /><br />I have to agree that is book seems to have been written by a teenager from England.  The repetition was obnoxious.  The story was boring.<br /><br /> I was angry because I would not want my daughters growing up thinking its normal to allow some strange man demean you because you think he's hot and rich.  She goes to a strange man's home and signs a contract regarding his alternative lifestyle.  She chooses to have sex with this stranger after seeing \\"the red room of torture\\".  Really?<br /><br />I hated this book!
030758836X|5.0|GONE GIRL by Gillian Flynn is easily one of the best books I've read in a long time. The opening act is awesome. It delivers a compelling, dramatic, suspenseful scenario that will have you taking time out of your busy day to read the novel.<br /><br />Up front, you should know the chapter titles give away some of the story. However, the overall structure of the book is what makes this book great. Each chapter alternates point of view, first from husband Nick, then from his wife Amy. This is a novel about a wife going missing. Chapter one begins with Nick telling about the day of. Then chapter two is Amy's diary beginning back when she first met Nick seven years ago. As we read, Flynn hooks the reader into Nick's plight as he is investigated, implicated and scorned for his suspected involvement in his wife's disappearance. But, did Nick actually have anything to do with Amy's disappearance? This is where the great writing comes through. The evidence certainly points to Nick, but enough clues are given to where we don't think he did it, yet through Amy's diary entries, we know NIck isn't that great of a guy because Amy felt threatened by him.<br /><br />The set up for this novel is great. The thing about a husband and wife conflict is that it really could happen to anyone. So, it's easy to imagine yourself in a relationship gone bad. Also, Flynn writes as to make the possibilities of what happened to Amy endless. Was she murdered? Did Nick do it? Was she alive? Where was she? Why did the evidence point to NIck? What was he hiding? Will they even get back together.<br /><br />Ultimately, once the second half of the book begins, many questions get answered. I have to give Flynn credit for the surprising twists and turns she inserts into this cat and mouse game between husband and wife. Considering the great set up in the first part of the novel, I believe the second half really holds up, and is just as good. Flynn is a really good writer and I can't wait to read her previous two novels.vious two novels.

B003YUOFHM|4.0|I wear a normal Womens shoe size 7 to 7.5. I wear a size 9 Womens in these Crocs! I had to return 2 pairs until I found the right size. Amazon returns were super easy, fast and convenient. I would suggest buying 2 sizes bigger than your regular shoe size when buying these shoes. As for the look of the shoes, the grey ones I bought go well with pretty much any outfit that I wear, and I even had people as where I got them. They get dirty easily, and since I am very anal about clean shoes, I am always cleaning these shoes. They have held up to many washings with stain remover and when I go after them with a toothbrush, they always come out looking new. Bottom line, beware of your shoe size when ordering these. Go 2 sizes BIGGER, seriously.

B0035JJJE6|5.0|The Revoltech SciFi 001 ALIEN. This is an insanely detailed, marvelously sculpted figure. It features wonderful articulation and is beautiful to look at. This little figure is very loyal to H. R. Giger's original design. The figure is durable and fun to play around with, although it is difficult to stand up without the base. I highly recommend the Alien Revoltech!

031603441X|5.0|One of the vestiges of the previous generation which bled over to mine was that you had to be either a Beatles guy or a Stones guy. Much as I like the Beatles, I've always been a Stones guy. I love blues, country, rock and roll - all the Stones' influences, and it was always clear to me that the heart and soul of the band was Keith Richards.<br /><br />How I managed to overlook his memoir, Life, for three years I do not know. But I just finished reading it, and I have to tell you, it is a really interesting, entertaining and funny book.<br /><br />If you are musical, his discussions of his signature, open five-string tuning, and his personal influences and idols are great. If you like surprises, you'll love that he was both a choirboy (literally) and a Boy Scout (literally.)<br /><br />I mostly enjoyed his explanation of the songwriting process they went through (he and Mick.) Really interesting stuff. Keith would normally write up the riffs and give it a title or idea, then hand it off. Mick could scrawl out a song per hour sometimes. Keith wrote some songs in his sleep. And the songs are almost never really about what you might think they were about. \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" was inspired by a stomping gardener named Jack who once woke up the \\"Glimmer Twins\\" who were sleeping late at Keith's house. \\"Flash\\" was just a word Mick thought sounded cool when he sang it.<br /><br />One of my favorite lines from the book comes when he is visiting his childhood neighborhood, and the local girls ask him, \\"Did you ever imagine...?\\"<br /><br />He replies, \\"I imagined everything. I never thought it would happen.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend it.
B005J4TLN4|4.0|Some have said this is like \\"Goonies\\" meets \\"Gremlins\\" and that is true only in the broadest sense.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. A young woman lives in a part of London peppered with low income housing. She is robbed at the hands of a local, teenage gang. Suddenly, the neighborhood is set upon by some mean aliens plummeting down from the skies. The boys manage to kill one which ticks the other aliens off to no end. So they are going to wreck some major havoc and try to kill pretty much anything that moves. Our female victim tags along with her tormentors to hopefully survive the situation and maybe even make things square. The authorities enter the fray to get pretty much everything wrong.<br /><br />Unlike the above mentioned films, this has no cute kids as heroes. These guys, though maybe not as tough as they think they are, have much more street savvy. They aren't out to survive the situation. They're out to prevail. Moses (played by John Boyega) is the leader of the gang. Yes he's tough, but you come to realize he's in a struggle to exist in a tough society. Sam (played by Jodie Whittaker) gets to see that Moses is not the one-dimensional evil-doer he he makes himself out to be. The rest of the crew are cool and funny, but not the cutesy funny of \\"Goonies\\" or \\"Gremlins.\\" They display street humor born of poor education and misinformation. It's satisfying to see Moses live up to his name as he goes through a transformation that gives him a reason to feel good about himself.<br /><br />The aliens are cool. The situations are cool. The music is fitting and you like the characters. I do wish the authorities weren't so constantly wrong. I mean, at some point, you have to believe your eyes and leave denial behind, but it's a minor quibble compared to the overall enjoyment of watching this film.<br /><br />I was worried that this might be a one time view, but I can easily see sitting through it again (and probably again). Is it a great film? No. But it's better entertainment than many of its kind.
B002DQLGHU|3.0|I recently viewed this, the first in the Harry Potter series of movies - it had been years since I'd first watched it and wondered how has it held up since its release and the subsequent movies have been released?  Overall the movie holds up well - the effects were well done so no issues of \\"that just looks so limited compared to today\\" like you might see with other effects-laden movies after a number of years.  And it struck me again how closely it followed the book.<br /><br />What limited me to 3 stars (I would give it 3-1/2 if Amazon allowed half-stars) was the fact that, especially compared to the later movies, the movement of the storyline was not as smooth.  I think that was due largely to having so much of Rowling's imaginative world to present and at the same time keeping the movie length to something the younger set could sit through.  Yes, the story is there and follows the book closely, but at times it does have somewhat of a \\"oh here's another aspect of life with magic and at Hogwarts we need to present...\\" jumpiness to it.<br /><br />So overall, 3 stars, definitely worth viewing.  I'm sure in a few years I'll watch it (and the other HP movies) again.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Kurt is a God. He was amazing on the Sheild, and now with Sons of Anarchy, well i dont think he can get anything better. My old man rides with a 1 percent club and so much of what the show is about is true life of a biker. The jail lock downs, and the club looking out for you till he is out again, the violence. It is not a way a life for the weak. I really hated the Clay and Gemma violence this 4th season only because they always played off each other so well and you really could beleive their love for each other. The only thing I would love for Kurt to change is to let Opie find some kind of happiness. Every season he gets crapped on from donna dieing then finding out that clay and tig betrayed him, to his new marraige is going down the toilet, and clay kills piney. Enough of Bobby getting locked down every season. That poor guy spends more time locked down then riding with the club. I honestly look fo clay to sorta move into the retired role that piney was in. i love piney though and not sure how next season will go without him. This is not a series you can really start watching from seaso 4 or the beginning of season5. You really have to follow the entire story from the season 1 on to really understand the whole situations going on. I also think we will see the end of Otto this next season. Poor Otto has pretty much gave everything he has and even his life because he is on death row now for getting back on the attack that left him blind, and the attack on jackson while he was in prison. This is an awsome show. and it only get better each season. I think Kurt picked the right people for each role. You will not be disappointed in this show
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good book that kept pulling me along.  Wish the end could have wrapped things up a bit more, but it is the first in a series so that was not an option.

B008D19WBQ|4.0|While I thoroughly enjoyed the extended cuts on the DVD versions, this collection will give you a chance to watch the episodes in the manner in which they were intended to be watched, and in high definition!<br /><br />And it's completely understandable why these HD versions must be the broadcast versions and I think, in the long run, the quality of the picture and audio, as well as some nifty packaging, far outweighs the need for an additional 2-3 minutes of bonus jokes per episode.

B005I6EU7U|5.0|If you're looking for a special cover that you won't just find anywhere, this is the one.  I own this one in Tan and Red, and the Tan one is the way to go.  It looks so natural and so authentic.  The red one looks a little on the cheap side, and I don't particularly  like it other than the color matches my living area.<br /><br /> But, the Tan one blends in with everything and has a muted color not to stand out, but to look very sophisticated.  I use the  Tan color one on my kindle keyboard which I keep in my purse, and it fits just fine, and I use the red one on my regular kindle I keep on my coffee table.  If the prices drop on these covers I plan to purchase another tan one for my kindle fire too.<br /><br />These covers have to be the best looking covers I've seen.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|After much researching, I found the perfect baby pool gift for my best friends sons 1st birthday. Although her son takes swim lessons, this pool is awesome to fill up 1/2 way & let your young child enjoy the summer.  The sprinklers shooting up are a nice touch...they're very light so no one gets shot in the eyeball LOL.  You'll certainly need some kind of a compressor to blow it up...but it's really quick!.  This pool is not only colorful, safe, and easy to use....it will be a huge hit with your little one!
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|If your mind processed my review title as a play on The Four Tops' \\"Standing in the Shadows of Love,\\" congratulations. That is precisely how I hoped they would be received. And, indeed, this album is nothing short but sensational love.It is a beautiful experience, from start to finish.<br /><br />The standout tracks are \\"Bad Religion,\\" \\"Pink Matter\\" and \\"Sierra Leone.\\" \\"Thinkin' Bout You,\\" arguably Frank's most recognizable song is on the album as well and this is understandable. However -- and I know my bias in bleeding through here -- I wish \\"Songs for Women\\" and \\"Whip Appeal\\" were included as well. The former is my favorite F.O. song.<br /><br />Hopefully, he and Nas will hit the studio again record the lost track, \\"No Such Thing As White Jesus\\" again. The lyrics to this cut indicate that it would have been another standout, if not for that bloody technological error. This album is one of the best--of any genre--I have heard in a long time. It is my sincere hope that the Grammys reward his talent and his effort with \\"Best New Artist\\" and \\"Best R&B Album\\" nods.<br /><br />So proud to have been a fan for years!

B007SGM084|2.0|Please pay attention to the negative reviews for this one. I'm sorry I purchased the series and I wish I could get a refund. I know people who love this story and I fail to grasp the reason why. Everything from character development to the story arc feels shallow and tasteless. I actually found myself skipping the sex scenes since I can only take so much descriptive penetration in one sitting. I usually like a lot of detail, but the author takes me a few steps beyond where I wanted to go. I would suggest downloading a sample and seeing if the work moves you to buy the full series.
B007B8EX9I|5.0|I watched seasons 1&2 in a weeks time. I'm watching it again with my wife. Just an amazing ending to season 2 :) Season 3 has a lot to live up to. The story lines are gripping.

0307730697|5.0|Biographies have been a solid staple of my reading diet for the past few months.  Looking deep into the lives of great people is educational, inspiring, and helps me become more of the person that I'm created to be.  For most of my life, I dreaded reading the biographies that was assigned to read, or given by friends and families.  But recently, I have discovered that learning from the lives of others has incredible benefits for my life.<br /><br />Last night, in tears, I finished [[ASIN:0307730697 Fearless: The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown]], a biographical work on the life of Navy SEAL Adam Brown.  But the term \\"biographical\\" doesn't describe what this book really is.  Fearless is a book about a man, displaying his failures as well as his successes, his patriotism, his courage, his love for his family and for his God.  Fearless is better described as \\"inspirational\\", \\"motivational\\", and \\"life-changing\\".<br /><br />Fearless is the story of Adam Brown, a home-grown boy from Hot Springs, Arkansas.  The story details his life and activities as a child and teenager, his descent into drug abuse after high school, and his climb out of that pit into the elite world of specialized Navy warfare as a member of Navy SEAL Team SIX.<br /><br />Fearless is inspirational.  Reading this story will encourage you to higher levels of love and service, for your family, your friends, your country.  The life of Adam Brown will inspire you to love more, like Christ did.<br /><br />Fearless is motivational.  As you read of the injuries, the challenges, the setbacks, that Adam Brown overcame, you'll quickly feel the confidence that you can achieve your dreams as well.<br /><br />Fearless is life-changing.  Very rarely do I tear up when I read a good story.  Even more rarely do I cry.  Fearless brought me to that point.  In the life of Adam Brown, we see a man who loved everyone.  His passion for his wife and children was overwhelming.  His comradeship with his fellow teammates was deep and enduring.  His compassion for the poor and oppressed Afghan children was incredible.  And his desire to live for his Savior was awe-inspiring.<br /><br />Adam Brown was living proof that \\"with God, all things are possible.\\"  He lived his faith for all to see.<br /><br />Fearless was so captivating that it was difficult to put it down, even though I knew how it had to end.  In the act of protecting his fellow Navy SEALs, and American freedom, Adam Brown gave the ultimate sacrifice.  And his story is well worth reading.<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection:<br />I received this book free from Multnomah Books as part of their Blogger Review Program.

0547569653|4.0|Just finished reading this fantastic book!  Scott took me on a journey that allowed me to take a peak into his life and what made him the runner he is today.  I've read several biographies recently about famous ultra-runners, however this one took the cake.  He was able to weave in subtle item that gave him a real \\"human\\" feel without giving away too much.  I lost respect with another ultra runner in her story where she laid out too much of her life story, but Scott left me with the Solid respect that is due.<br /><br />This book gave a birds eye look at the front of the pack racing and wove into the story how food is as important as the training we do.  I'm not disciplined enough to follow such advice, yet I enjoyed reading how it changed/improved his life and his running.<br /><br />This is a must read for all ultra runners.

While they definitely encourage you to make IAP's in this game, the fact of the matter is that you can earn plenty of GLU currency in-game to make necessary item/unit upgrades as the game gets tougher.<br /><br />As far as the fun factor goes, it is definitely a 5-star game through and through.  The only drawback has to be the occasional slow framerates during the game.  When there is a lot of action on the screen, lag incurred has definitely resulted in a death or two.  Framerate issues also happen all the time while playing pachinko; you have to shoot the balls quickly to keep the prize multiplier maxed out at 5x.  Overall, these problems are slight, and don't severely detract from the quality of the game.  I highly recommend checking this out, and will gladly award an additional star if and when the framerate problems are remedied in the future.
0061730327|3.0|A really interesting book about courage, inventiveness and drive. One of the things it brought home to me is how much we are cheating our kids out of solid educations. The boy in this book is 14, doesn't go to school and can't read English yet he gets electricity for his entire village on an outdated textbook. He's 14! Obviously it is a case of \\"necessity is the mother of invention\\" to some extent but it is quite remarkable to realize how much this young man accomplishes. Great book club book. Would be good for YAs, too.

B00466HN6S|1.0|How on Earth did the people behind the brilliant [[ASIN:B002ZG97E2 Despicable Me]] also produce this excruciating bomb?  Instead of signaling (as I'd hoped) the rise of another great animation studio, Hop makes me fear for the upcoming Despicable Me sequel. Perhaps these people AREN'T that brilliant after all; perhaps they merely got lucky.<br /><br />Somewhat surprisingly, this movie begins by giving away a big part of the ending, that slacker Fred becomes the first human Easter Bunny, but after you've suffered through it the reason becomes obvious: to keep the audience from hating E.B. even more as we watch him callously and selfishly ruining Fred's life.<br /><br />By far the best part of the movie follows as viewers along with a young E.B. are taken upon an extensive tour of the amazing factory that makes all the goodies that go into Easter baskets; enjoy it while it lasts because it is all downhill from here.<br /><br />Many years later, the once adorably cute young E.B. is now grown, though far from grownup.  Faced with a father who refuses to listen to his last minute announcement that he wants to be a drummer not the Easter Bunny, E.B. does what any selfish and useless slacker would do;<br /><br />he bails for Hollywood two weeks before Easter, leaving chaos in his wake and bringing a lot of chaos with him into the human world, specifically into the life of another useless slacker, Fred O'Hare whose family is shown engaging in a desperate and unfunny parody of an \\"intervention\\" in order to get his lazy rear end off the couch and back into the working world.  Despite ham-handed attempts to make his family into the bad guys, it is hard not to despise callous and selfish Fred...<br /><br />until even more despicable E.B. shows up and does the impossible: make the audience occasionally sympathize with Fred because he's finally met someone less likable than he is.  The absolute nadir has to be when while selfishly stowing away with Fred (after promising not to) E.B. pops out and pushes Fred into ruining his adopted baby sister's Easter pageant for no apparent reason other than his own selfish cruelty.  (I guess it's supposed to be \\"OK\\" because she's first shown singing very badly, but Fred's deliberately made to be loathsome father has it right when he sums it up as \\"upstaging grade schoolers\\".)  What makes it even worse is that we can see Alex O'Hare (Tiffany Espensen) in the background becoming increasingly upset as her brother (apparently quite deliberately) ruins her big day (she had the starring role).<br /><br />How sick do you have to be to even THINK this might be funny?<br /><br />E.B.'s last minute change of heart (from being totally heartless) isn't remotely believable, and not even Carlos' (Hank Azaria's) lunatic, vicious, borderline racist, and occasionally funny coup attempt can save this disaster or redeem its sociopath of a hero..B. pops out and pushes Fred into ruining his adopted baby sister's Easter pageant for no apparent reason other than his own selfish cruelty.

B005LAIIS0|3.0|Director Joe Carnahan made such a promising and exciting start in the feature film business with the 70's crime drama throwback NARC. It was strong, exciting and a shot in the arm to a tiring genre. He followed that up with the bizarre yet oddly entertaining ensemble actioner SMOKING ACES, but once locked into the Hollywood machine, he did the unnecessary but not-too-terrible film version of the 80's TV show THE A-TEAM, which teamed him for the first time with strong dramatic actor who became rebranded as action star Liam Neeson. This somehow led to THE GREY, a film that is not the survival adventure promised in the previews. THE GREY is an occasionally thoughtful, extremely existental, and ultimately predictible Man Versus Nature drama.<br /><br />We have John Ottway (Neeson, finally being allowed to speak in his natural accent), a gruff and suicidally depressed \\"exterminator\\" of sorts who works on an oil-drilling site in Alaska. His job essentially consists of picking off nasty man-eating wolves that look to use the workers as kibble with his rifle. He ponders poetically about his wife and how he misses her and how he knows he'll never be with her again. The other workers are, for the most part, societal outcasts; they're ex-cons, drifters, quick to anger and violence, meaning that Ottway is right at home with them. But it's time for them to go home, so they catch a plane back to Anchorage. There are warnings of a storm, or as co-writers Carnahan and Ian Mackenzie Jeffers (who wrote the short story this film is based on) call it, foreshadowing. The plane naturally crashes (in an uncomfortably effective set piece) and Ottway finds himself taking charge of a ragged and motley crew of survivors and look to stay alive amongst the harsh weather of the Alaska's snowy wastelands. Before too long, it seems that Ottway's work has followed him to the crash site as they soon find themselves surrounded by a pack of vicious ravening wolves. So instead of this being a story about men coming together and fighting the elements, it becomes something of a horror film as the men begin getting picked off one by one as Ottway tries to lead them to safety.<br /><br />Despite the film's massive leaps of logic and sense in order to manufacture forward momentum, it's an interesting film to watch. Carnahan does a commendable job of showing the brutal and unforgiving climate and also shows some beautiful vistas of the Alaskan wilderness. He's also pretty good at creating suspense, but it's really just enough to keep you watching despite knowing just about everything that's going to happen. You know that the film will become allegorical at one point for the behavior of the animals and the behavior of the men. You know there will be someone that will eventually challenge Ottway's \\"alpha\\" status, and that comes in the form of Diaz (the most interesting character of the film as played by a very volatile Frank Grillo, a great character actor). The whole cast of survivors, including Dallas Roberts and a very unrecognizable Dermot Mulroney, essentially seem to be analogues of the cast of John Carpenter's arctic existential horror masterpiece THE THING, but even that's not a terribly new idea. Survival thrillers often have the same archetypal characters. The film also delves into the nature of humanity's faith and the existence of a higher power, and this is where the film succeeds at being surprising yet unnecessarily ham-fisted as it becomes the love-child of Jack London and Samuel Beckett by way of Carnahan's profanity-and-gore-laden narrative. Neeson does nice work here and it further cements his current bad-ass status, but this is not even as interesting or as memorable of a role as Bryan Mills in TAKEN.<br /><br />Where I think the biggest disconnect is between audiences and this film is, exists in the realm of its marketing. This film promises certain things in the trailers and the commercials but doesn't live up to them, and the most glaring example of that is in the film's climax which is the very end of the film. While the moment promised to us is hardly the point of the film, it's something that everyone wanted to see, and when that was taken away from us, we felt cheated. There's truth to that. Most of the negative reviews specifically have to do with the film's ending and how it didn't live up to some very specific expectations, and that's more to do with the marketing than the film, because this is a film where the narrative isn't dependent on a climactic showdown between Ottway and the wolves; it's a more contemplative film than that. So I just don't think that we can blame Carnahan for the ending not meeting those expectations; Universal wanted to get butts in seats and what better way to do that with a film like this than the promise of Liam Neeson taping broken glass to his fists to do battle with a wolf?<br /><br />One way or the other, the biggest problem with THE GREY is that it attempts to be a thought-provoking piece of the existental crisis of Man Versus Nature, but because it's more structured like a survival horror film, it ends up not being terribly successful in either way.<br /><br />3/5 Stars.f that is in the film's climax which is the very end of the film.

This newest pair have a defect in the assembly where the plastic in the ear piece is not smoothly sealed so they scratch my ear ever so slightly. For the price, I'm satisfied but they are neither great quality or highly recommendable. Adequate for non-picky people.

0393317552|4.0|This book is an easy read.  The most interesting thing for me is that it contains a great summary of the human world to the 1500's.  If you want to know about anything from the development of metallurgy, to language, to domestication of plants and animals, this book talks about it.<br /><br />One con of this book is that it sometimes can feel repetitive.  There were many times that I thought \\"Oh, great, thanks for telling me again that 'guns, germs, and steel' are the end results of such and such.\\"  I would have much preferred that the title be something like \\"The Fates of Human Societies\\" and slowly work up to \\"Germs\\" in the first third, then \\"Steel\\" in the 2nd third, then \\"Guns\\" in the 3rd third.

0812993292|4.0|This book is a treat to read, and I imagined walking along with Harold and his ragtag crew of sometime fellow walkers. Harold is struggling to remake himself and emerge a new and improved man. His marriage is broken, he has not seen the son he loves in twenty years, and he betrayed Queenie, a co-worker, years ago.<br />Until he gets a short letter from the dying Queenie, his life was drab and utterly lacked purpose. Harold is 65, retired, and has nothing to do with his days, until he decides to walk 500 miles to see Queenie. His wife is infuriated and betrayed by Harold's sudden and unplanned departure. This book could get five stars for the author's skill and creativity but unpleasant plot twists toward the end caused me to rate this a four, which is still a high rating. I recommend this book, and a modern journey novel I like even more is \\"Harriet Beamer Takes the Bus\\" which is a bit more upbeat.
6304712936|5.0|There are AFI top 100 movies that I watch once because I feel I should. There are movies I watch several times because they're involving. And then there are movies I own because they are immensely powerful. Amadeus is definitely one that I own, and one that I highly encourage others to watch several times if not own.<br /><br />Nearly 3 hours long, Amadeus is a work of art. There are numerous of Mozart's works on display here, not only with the gorgeous music, but put into a context. You can see why Mozart created these works and how they were received. You see the sets, see the environments they were put on within. Yes, you can argue about whether Mozart had that kind of laugh or whether he behaved the way the movie claims he did. But that's all beside the point. We'll never really know. What we DO know is the fantastic works of art he created, and how they are experienced when put on by a high quality orchestra, presented in full sound and color.<br /><br />What's amazing is that the main actor here, F. Murray Abraham, isn't even playing Mozart. He's the antagonist, Salieri, whose only desire in life is to create beautiful music for God. When he sees how short his talents are compared with Mozart, and what a disappointment Mozart is in so many other ways, he makes it his quest in life to take Mozart down. What follows is heartbreaking.<br /><br />There are so many little touches in the story that catch at you. The way Mozart is oblivious to how he's hurting Salieri when he has fun embellishing the march. To him it's simple child's play to make the march more interesting. The way he has fun playing upside down and backwards. He enjoys his gift. He feels lonely that few understand him.<br /><br />On the down side, there were many important women involved in this situation who are barely touched on. Salieri's obsession is a talented opera singer. And then there's Mozart's wife. She keeps him afloat, takes action to save the family at several points, and yet the ONLY time in the entire movie that a woman talks with another woman is when Mozart's wife briefly asks her new maid (Cynthia Dixon of Sex in the City fame) to please step outside. That's it! It's 99% about men.<br /><br />Still, a minor point when the star of this movie is really the music. I could play this in the background and just absorb the gorgeous music being presented. Highly recommended as a movie to connect a wealth of people with music the might not have been drawn to otherwise.time in the entire movie that a woman talks with another woman is when Mozart's wife briefly asks her new maid (Cynthia Dixon of Sex in the City fame) to please step outside.

B0006GANN2|5.0|The French Connection is an amazing, true-life story which earned a #70 spot on the AFI Top 100 of movies for many reasons. One is that it features a car chase thought to be one of the best in cinema history. A car chases a subway trail through the streets of New York City, nearly getting destroyed along the way. The storyline is that of two NYC detectives who happen on a drug transaction involving a Frenchman. The detectives get grief from within the force, but with perseverence they are able to track down the perpetrators.<br /><br />Watching this in modern times is fascinating. First, there's a lot of throwing around of slurs about just about every ethnic group you can imagine. There is police brutality, slurs against women, against blacks, against Italians, against French, and it's all considered as normal. There's pretty much only one woman in the entire movie and I think she has two lines total. A cop shoots a suspect in the back and it's presented as typical. I do want to note that research shows that the police advisors to the movie complained about that scene and were overruled. But we definitely commented on that when watching it. And we do have NYC police in our family.<br /><br />It's interesting to watch how much life has changed in other ways. A guy goes to a ticket counter at an airline and buys a ticket with cash, and writes his own name on the ticket to take to the gate. In a subway, someone knocks on the driver's door and he simply opens it to see what they want. Nobody else seems to be able to stop the train - there were no emergency stop lines. And of course in modern times people would be tweeting and calling from the train, not completely cut off.<br /><br />I loved the scene where a drug dealer is being trailed and he's able to shake off the cop simply by getting on and off a subway. In modern times they'd be quite able to handle that situation. Here, it throws him completely off his game.<br /><br />I was vastly amused when Roy Scheider, also famous from Jaws, was tracking down one of his enemies, and they started to play Jaws-like music. Of course this movie here came first, so it's almost as if they saw how powerful it was here and then ramped it up even more a few years later for Jaws.<br /><br />Is the way citizens are treated a bit concerning? Certainly. Is the time-capsule look into the way things were run back in 1971 absolutely fascinating? Yes, yes, yes. Highly recommended as a glimpse into a world of not too long ago, to see how far we have come, and also how in some ways things have stayed quite the same.<br /><br />Rating: 5/5famous from Jaws, was tracking down one of his enemies, and they started to play Jaws-like music.

The characters grow on you and the sex is not nearly as \\"out there\\" as it was led to be.<br /><br />I was one who gave into the hype thinking it was going to be a shocking eye opening book about S&M and had to see what all the hype was about. In the end it is a decent story. I just wish it was edited better to cut out all the repetition.<br /><br />I am on the second book and the storyline is actually a bit better. If you do read the first I pretty much guarantee you will want to read the other two to see what happens.<br /><br />Oh - I do enjoy the email banter between the two main characters. They are very amusing!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I cant belive this album!  I bought it for Rolling In the Deep, but ended up listening to all the songs almost immediately.  This album is really heartfelt and I love all the emotion in it.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|Was excited to view the movies because this is Blu-ray and everything is better on Blu-ray. Right? Have seen them all previously but the treat for me was watching in Blu-ray. The original Alien is still one of the best in the sci-fi, horror genre.
B0073PPKNM|4.0|I give The Absence 4 out of 5 stars only because for me it would have been perfect if there were a few more uptempo Latin/Brazilian/African songs like Iemenja and Mira. I would suggest purchasing the mp3 as I have which comes with a 25 minute long track by track analysis by Melody herself as well as acoustic/'in-studio' versions of Mira and Iemenja....on the last track during the interview, she answers many of the questions that people have mentioned in their reviews here, including those about her entire journey abroad and the music itself.<br />I was sitting in Starbucks and I heard a song playing, I immediately knew it was Melody singing because I've been a fan for several years. In hindsight; the song that was playing was Mira and at that time I just thought it was brilliant and immediately purhased the album on itunes-no hesitation. I was completely thrilled and I continue to swoon over this album.<br />Melody infuses several different cultures and musical styles but stays true to herself with this album. Somehow she makes you feel connected to the world and all of your senses even more than usual...but I will say in order to enjoy this album even if you are a fan of her music- you must  have a certain level of musical sophistication and the need for your senses to be delighted.
0345803507|1.0|I wish that I had gone with my first instinct and not purchase the 3rd installment of this series!!!  I read many of the reviews for the book good and bad, I wish that I had listened to the bad reviews!  This was a complete waste of my time, patience and money!  There was no plot WHAT SO EVER in this book.  I hoped and prayed that I would eventually start to get involved in the book but I could not.  To say that this book fail short  is an understatement.  The series should have ended with the 2nd installment.  I have no idea how many pages I skipped just to get to the ending of the book, which by the way did not excite me there either.<br /><br />One of my main issues that I have with this author is the fact that she did not write not one single iota of how SORE Anastasia should have been after all the rounds of sex that she and Christian had.  I mean really, as a woman, you should know that your body needs a breather after several constant rounds of vigorous sex especially with Anastasia just losing her virginity!!!<br /><br />Another annoying item with this series is the fact that Anastasia is so weak its sickening.  How many times does someone have to apologize for something that they did not do just to make the other person feel good about themselves?  And why is it that good ole Dr. Flynn never told Christian that what Elena did to him was child abuse??? Am I the only one that has a problem with that fact?<br /><br />Please do not waste your money on this book!!!  Book one was a good read, book two was predictable but ok, this third book was a complete utter and useless waste!!
B003K9LZSO|4.0|Not your usual Dr. Who episode. One of the few where The Doctor does not save the world/spaceship/companion. And one that was as enjoyable as disturbing.  A brilliant story that seem non-episodic and taken out of . . .    . . . The Twilight Zone.    I just can't decide if it reminds me more of the season 1 or 4 monolouge.    1) There is a fifth dimension, beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition, and it lies between the pit of man's fears and the summit of his knowledge. This is the dimension of imagination. It is an area which we call the Twilight Zone.  --Rod Serling    4) You unlock this door with the key of imagination. Beyond it is another dimension: a dimension of sound, a dimension of sight, a dimension of mind. You're moving into a land of both shadow and substance, of things and ideas; you've just crossed over into the Twilight Zone.[11]  --Rod Serling    monologues copied from Wikipedia: [...]
B007PTJOV0|5.0|one of the best free apps available for the kindle. highly recommended. very much like Mario bros. fun for all ages
B00846REIS|1.0|I bought this based on the review that if you liked 50 Shades of Gray that you would love this book. NOT! Several times I caught myself thinking \\"is this plagiarism?\\" Don't get me wrong, the writing was better, but the storyline was almost exactly the same.  I felt like I was watching a rerun on tv.  I will not be buying the second novel.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was amazing! I don't usually read romance novels but after hearing all my friends talk about it I figured I'd gives it a try. I read these books nonstop! Love them. Wish there was more in this series!
B0052VUNHC|3.0|I have mixed emotions about this book.  I really wanted to love this book but just couldn't get into it.  It's based on a college life and it had me reminiscing about my own past college life.  That's about all the book did for me.  The story's just missing something.  Seemingly goody-good girl meets mr. bad boy, on again/off again relationship, fighting/making up, and sex.  Period.  Too bad.

B0055V6EZE|5.0|I´m an old boy from Old Germany and have listened to this music for over 50 years. For me that is the  New Orleans Music-album of the year! Laurie and the band are creating every tune new. When you like Dr. John, Willy DeVille, Fess Longhair, James Booker or The Neville Brothers, this is the music for you. No gimmick, no \\"just another version of\\", that`s Louisiana-Swamp- Boogaloo at it`s best. Everybody in the band plays from his heart, the voice and the pianoplaying of H. Laurie is fantastic. And the sound of the music is high standard. Let the good times roll again, Hugh! You`re on the right track!
034580404X|5.0|I love this trilogy!! I am almost finished with the second book and I cannot put it down! My friend who recommended the books to me read them all TWICE! I might be following in her footsteps!

1468161660|5.0|I read this book on a recent trip to India. I bought it having no idea what it was about except that it seemed to have great reviews. I started it on the plane ride and could not put it down. What I finally got to my final destination I only had one chapter left so I stayed up even though it was 7 AM and I had been traveling for 30 hours to finish it. When I met up with my sisters and friend in India they were desperate for something to read so I gave them this book. All three of them finished it in 24 hours or less and then they all read it a second time. It was that good! I highly recommend it is you like poetry and romance. It is well written and appropriate for a younger audience as well since there are no sex scenes. It is a truly romantic and passionate story. Do not be thrown off by the self publishing, the story is so much better then the printing!!
B0065UF2ZM|4.0|Just keeps getting better and better I look forward to receiving my next book with harry bosch as the main character. Fully recommend this book.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|The story plot thickens in the 2nd book of this trilogy.  As it does, we get a clearer more \\"humane\\" view of Mr. \\"FIFTY SHADES\\" Gray and of Ana herself.  I cannot wait to read the 3rd book of this trilogy
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Did anyone else get the feeling that Charlie was autistic?<br />The book itself was okay. But I couldn't help but wonder if he was on the spectrum for autism.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The characters were horrible. The worst is the girl. Very immature and stupid acting. If I had to read about her inner goddess one more time I would scream.  Sad I wasted my money.
0061969656|5.0|Bernard Cornwell continues to show he is an author to be reckoned with. His story line is solid and his characters bring life to tale. It takes someone with true talent to capture the reader up front and then hold them throughout the story, wanting to skip ahead to see what happens, but not wanting the story to end.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is a fun game and the only thing I don't like about is that the sound when you collect coins is different from the apple ipad and ipod rouch
B007R41E8O|4.0|I'm not sure what it is with these puzzle/hidden objects game, but I can do without all the story line stuff. As far this game goes, I'm enjoying it so far, only I find the only way to move forward is to use the &quot;?&quot; (hint)  feature quite a bit.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was a fun summer read.  I liked the ideas Mr. Cline had for the near-future \\"real world\\".  If he continues writing books in this setting I hope he spends more time in the real world instead of the virtual one fleshing out the ideas he began in this book. My only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that the constant pop-culture references started to wear on me as the story progressed.
B005FLX1HS|5.0|Don't quite know what to say.  I'm obsessed.  This album is a shot of pure adrenaline.  I don't even need coffee in the morning when I listen to this on my way to work. It's great for working out and dancing to.  It's probably an \\"acquired taste,\\" so to speak.  But if you like intense music and electronica, you will love this.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|I loved this story, I quite enjoy narratives aimed at the teen reader.  Of course, the plot is all surreal but the imaginative style of the story makes it all that more readable. I felt that at least with teens having to kill other teens -and hopefully that would never happen - that there was a lot of remorse and feeling that this was purely a matter of survival of the fittest-even if in the extreme....an enjoyable read.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I've never sweated so hard using an at home dvd workout.  I feel like I get more accomplished in 20 minutes than I do working out for an hour at the gym.  I definately feel that the workout is working.  I've been doing it for a week and have lost 7lbs.  I highly recommend this DVD!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series was very enjoyable. Great characters, and I wanted the saga to go on and on. It was nice to have a twist or two on this type of story. The path to our own destruction, and preservation is truly remarkable.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Toward the end of the New York battle scene, Captain America takes a laser blast to the gut.  Thor asks him \\"Are you ready for another round?\\".  Captain America responds,\\"what, are you getting sleepy?\\"  CAPTAIN AMERICA should have said, \\"Are you kidding, I could do this all day!\\" or \\"Are you kidding, I could do this.., well,  The rest of the afternoon anyway.\\"<br />  Love it!  Can't wait for \\"Iron Man 3\\" filming now...  Go Stark!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am absolutely in love with this trilogy. It can be repetitive but the story is so good that I can look past all of that. Christian Grey and Anatasia have a powerful love that is so passionate, with a naughty twist. I was completely captivated by this book and when it was over I felt heart broken and sad! I missed and still miss Grey. I have already started re reading it! Not to mention, its a good break from the typical teen love story!
1609611543|5.0|This book is filled with incredible research, knowledge, and even some humor.  Well worth the read.  In fact, it might should be required reading!
055338466X|3.0|I first read A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking in grade school, then later after garnering (to one degree or another) a decent understanding of the basic principles of physics and the universe. My level of understanding increased as I repeated my sojourn into the text as well as with age, experience, and studies. I was captivated and made physics, especially the quantum variety, something of an odd hobby. I rarely shared this passion with anyone...at least not until much later when \\"Bazinga\\" became a recognizable and more socially acceptable punch line.<br /><br />I only recently decided to dive into The Grand Design. My reading list is long, and not all hobbies and passions can be realized and explored at the same time (well, maybe they can in the multiverse concept). And what is time anyway? I will admit at the onset that this book did mess with my head. I remember upon completion (the same day I was becoming familiar with Krauss's new book about `nothing') I could barely sleep, and went to bed with complex ideas concerning how one really could divide by zero. I do have nerd issues.<br /><br />Conceptually, I liked reading The Grand Design. However, the authors could have had the same effect in achieving purpose by publishing this work in much shorter form, perhaps a long entry in an academic journal, or a more reachable even shorter piece in a magazine...something like Popular Science. I'd shorten the first chapter, then weld it right alongside Chapter 6, skipping most of the middle and only applying conceptual explanation where absolutely necessary for reader comprehension. As an effective piece of literature, I'm sure the authors lost readers around Chapter 3 in many cases. The material in the middle chapters is technical and easily beyond the scope of the average reader's abilities in understanding. Dumbing down the language and rhetoric is doubtfully helpful. I know lay people picked up A Brief History of Time and could immediately find value; I justdon't see that happening with this text, especially if it's prone to readers only getting through the first couple of chapters. Maybe the target audience is the hobbyist, like me.<br /><br />I guess it just wasn't what I expected, and there is nothing really wrong with that. But marketing for this book (at least what I've seen thus far), seems to equate this to Hawking's earlier works--a false comparison. Also, and more importantly, I really expected to learn something new and abrupt. This book was more of a rehash of ideas that have been around for a decade or more. Many authors have dealt with the something from nothing idea, M-theory, and more. I did enjoy the concept of the Game of Life, my sole `new' finding during my read. When I finished, I wanted more, but not in the literarily curious way, but in the way of answers. I didn't get many.<br /><br />If you do decide to read the book, I recommend the paper version as opposed to eBook. I read this on my Kindle, and it lacked what I saw in the store, beautiful glossy pictures to help along the way. Instead, I got miniatures in black and white. Perhaps it's time to update to the Fire.<br /><br />(3 out of 5 stars as I did get something out of the read and enjoy the authors as scientists...but, probably more of a 2 in terms of literary value)
0345803485|1.0|A common notion among writers is that all writing is autobiographical.  When I read a novel, I try to imagine what kind of person would write such a thing.<br /><br />When I was in school, there was a certain type of girl who was often invited to a certain type of party.  The boys hosting these parties were the popular set- athletes, rich kids, good lookers, etc.  Their problem was that their A-list girlfriends were saving it for marriage.  So they invited girls with noses a little too big, asses a little too wide, etc. to what were called \\"pig parties to work the squirt.\\"  I think our writer was one of these.<br /><br />The strange thing about the girls at these parties was that they either didn't know they were at a pig party or were hoping that this was their ticket to get someone cool to like them. Now, James wants you to fantasize being invited to a one girl pig party, put your hand in your pants and enjoy the fun.  Sorry to be so frank here but that's what I see here.

B0038P59A0|3.0|I must admit when I was a little boy my first taste of the Sherlock movies were with Basil Rathbone so no matter who plays the part I always in the back of my mind compare them with that version of Sherlock and to this day he's my favorite actor for that particular role.  I read most of the original Sherlock Holmes books years ago so Robert Downey Jr's version took a lot getting used to.  I think he plays a pretty good version of Holmes in his own way but it took some adjusting with how quickly he explained things throughout the film.
B0012UHSDO|5.0|I have always watched Breaking bad but I love watching all the behind the scenes and sneak peaks. There are always things aired that you dont see in the show. I have been hooked for a couple years now

0060005696|2.0|The evidence was as solid as a '1 out of 10 dentists' endorsement on a toothpaste commercial. I understand what he's getting at with his thesis but 56% of this book used 100% of its pages to use 95% out-of-the-air statistics. Not to mention, the opening just pretty much boiled down to a conversational tone akin to Andy Rooney where he was mad because he went to buy jeans and THERE WERE TOO MANY JEANS!!! There are other books by writers touching on this subject that do a better job addressing the topic. C. Ryan's review says it best with regards to the nitty gritty about why this book has issues and I couldn't have phrased it better. Buy this if you CHOOSE to but don't have a cow about having to choose a book.
B0085776BG|1.0|Though I have to admit to enjoying the aerial fight scenes (always have been a sucker for aerial dogfight footage), this story has been done to death. There has never been a group of airmen that have been given the amount of filmstock as have the black pilots that made up this squadron. One would think that they alone defeated the Luftwaffe. For goodness sake anyone in that theater of war flying the later model P51 would have met with great success against the relatively obsolete aircraft that the Luftwaffe fielded in the latter part of the war (with the rare exception of the Germans superb jet aircraft that simply arrived too late and in too few numbers to \\"turn the tide\\" toward the Germans in the air.<br />The Germans also suffered from the massive loss of experienced pilots during the last couple of years of the Great War because of idiotic war policies created by politicians rather than military men, much like the United States has done in every conflict we have been engaged in since 1945. Politicians cannot even master politics much less handle the complexities of warfare and the results always prove that fact.<br />This movie is just another PC rehash of a tired story of one group of pilots. It seems that roughly every 5 years someone gets together enough funding to tell the same story about the same group again and again and always with the same result. Dismal box office figures because nobody wants to watch essentially re-runs.<br />I remain a sucker for dogfight footage though and could care less about the color of the pilots, it's all about \\"action\\".
0062103377|4.0|It just is what it says it is, hence it implements the first rule of hunting according to Bobby Singer: \\"It is what it looks like.\\" But that is maybe slightly superficial. But that may be satisfactory for people who are only trying to get lists and in front of each name the method to kill it. No other explanation except the fifth and last rule (a beautiful diabolic or satanic, and what's more double, pentacle): \\"It ain't dead till it's in five pieces.\\"<br /><br />In other words it is in no way a tool for the curious minds who would like to understand the appeal of this series, particularly to the gay or gay-friendly community. Especially since there is no index, which makes the use of the book difficult.<br /><br />The second characteristic of the book is that it is in the first person, as if Bobby Singer himself was telling us the story, was speaking to us. That makes it intimate and that makes Bobby Singer appear as what he is, the surrogate father of the two brothers. Bobby-Sam-Dean, BSD, or is it Bobby-Dean-Sam, BDS? On one side the Berkeley Software Distribution, free software, free weapons, free hunting, or on the other side the British Deer Society and this time hunting again but under control. Poor dear deer, you will never survive this BDS band of hunters.<br /><br />It is easy reading but it will not explain why Bobby is playing father to the two brothers, and why this fatherly situation is appealing to the audience, and why the original father was eliminated twice in the series, once symbolically and a second time really by killing and dying. Why wouldn't a real father be appealing in such a situation? Because a real father is real authority and real limitations, whereas a surrogate father is a source of information, great help when needed, but no authority except practical. There is no real intimacy between the surrogate father and the brothers, at least not beyond the business at hand. No love wasted on either side. And look at the grandfather Samuel how treacherous he is and how he has to be dealt with in the most violent and expedient way.<br /><br />But once again you will not understand why that situation is appealing to the audience whereas the real father situation would not be. What makes a real father sacred and untouchable? What makes a surrogate father nothing but a prop on the road and not a sentimental character, a character you could and should not love more than just friendly love, and what's more a character you can betray or you can refuse to follow. A surrogate father is good enough when you need him. A real father is always there, good or bad, love or hate, always there.<br /><br />The archetype of a father and two sons or brothers is that of Steinbeck's \\"East of Eden\\", but here it is carefully avoided. And it is not explained at all why. So you will not understand the widower position of Bobby and his subsequent celibacy and the failure of all occasional opportunities to get out of it. Too bad. Use your mind and try to understand yourself. There is so much to be said about this series.<br /><br />There is also another element which is irritating. Rufus is quoted three times. As a hunting comrade in a first chapter entitled \\"Rufus\\", as the father whose daughter is killed in Omaha because Bobby had more or less invited her to witness a kill and she witnessed it slightly too close, and finally in the last meeting of theirs in a hunt in which Bobby kills Rufus (which by the way is not said that blundtly), and the book forgets to tell us how Rufus was buried which is all the more important since he was not incinerated like all hunters are but buried following the Jewish rite because he was Jewish. And that is pushed under the carpet. Too bad for those who do not remember some details.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUw treacherous he is and how he has to be dealt with in the most violent and expedient way.<br /><br />But once again you will not understand why that situation is appealing to the audience whereas the real father situation would not be.

B008133MDK|4.0|Though I watched the first year for free via Netflix I had to look to see if there were any more episodes to be found. There were and they were at Amazon and though they werent \\"free\\" they were worth the price of purchase. I only wish I could have had the option of renting them however as I don't really think I will re-watch the series, at least for a couple of years.<br />I had sworn off any remakes of Sherlock Holmes following the superb performance by the late Jeremy Britt. This series is a modern day remake of the series however and completely different from the period piece that Mr. Britt portrayed Holmes in. The actor whose name escapes me that plays the current day Dr. Watson also does a tremendous job and teamed with the actor that portrays Holmes makes for a great team effort and a very enjoyable series.<br />I highly recommend this second season and the first and look forward to future episodes when they become available.
0061367036|4.0|Apart from a few pictures of some of these monsters as realized in the series, the book is of great interest because it gives a rather exhaustive list of these monsters and their descriptions. They are presented in chapters that differentiate spirits from monsters; ghouls, revenants etc from witches, familiars, and black dogs (the page of these is not specified in the table of contents) and from demons. Two appendixes give alphabetical indexes of herbs, oils and hoodoo hands on one hand, and the names and attributes of European demons on the other hand.<br /><br />We can wonder why non-European demons are not also treated in an appendix. We can wonder why the beings are not treated in alphabetical order in the various chapters. But those are details, aren't they? Just like the fact there is no index.<br /><br />But don't be surprised if the book only looks at the demonic sides of things. Indians are reduced to curses only connected with burying grounds, though in the series when an Indian curse is used it is not to protect a burying ground but to get some kind of vengeance for a massacre of Indians by white settlers who wanted to take their land. You could be justified in thinking this book is biased.<br /><br />The Woman in White is universal, says the book. Is she really universal? The haunting woman who is walking the earth, crying and at times avenging herself for some kind of injustice is very common, but we could consider it as a mythological archetype that has vastly survived in our modern consciousness that makes us believe a woman, particularly a crying mother with babe is innocent. In the miniseries \\"The Pacific\\" an example is given in the last episodes of a civilian Japanese woman with a baby, trying to give the baby to the American soldiers around her and attracting them, at the same time diverting their attention, with this situation and when enough of them are around her she detonates the explosives she was carrying around her waist. Innocent you said?<br /><br />And it is the same thing in \\"Supernatural\\". The woman in white, or Bloody Mary, or whatever other woman who was the victim of some injustice, or who had committed some crime, in both cases we have injustice or crime followed by the death of the woman, these women are looking for justice in blind vengeance on some people who get caught in their haunting traps. It is effective as for suspense and horror and also as for our sense of justice being fulfilled, the liberation of the haunting spirit being achieved.<br /><br />But the archetype is not caught. This goes back to the emergence of Homo Sapiens from the primates before him. The premature state of the human baby requires two years of breast feeding and three to five years of very close care. That determined a clear division of labor along a sexual line: women looked after the children and carried them. They were either carrying a baby or infant that they breast-fed, or carrying a future baby in their womb. That's where this archetype of the victimized mother and of our pity for a mother with babe comes from. It is as old as Homo Sapiens. This book does not go into such consideration.<br /><br />That makes the book a useful tool but for people who are just accumulating direct and superficial knowledge on the series, not a tool to go beyond and analyse why it speaks so deeply to us. But that's the limitation of the genre: a book for aficionados and not a book for intellectuals. Some will tell me this is only an entertaining series. Of course. The Iliad was also just plain entertainment. That does not prevent us, human beings and human minds, from asking the silly question: \\"But what is the meaning of all that gore, horror and terror?\\"<br /><br />That question is not answered by this book.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU<br /><br />And it is the same thing in \\"Supernatural\\".

B007X15GRQ|4.0|It does seem that everything Mark Wahlburg touches turns to gold. The only movie in which he appeared that I didn't thoroughly enjoy was the Planet of the Apes redux. The man is always a sure thing in an action/adventure role and I wish there were some way that I could thank him for supplying me with hours of entertainment.<br />The strangest thing is that his brother is probably the better actor and I enjoy just about everything he appears in as well. The two of them have come a LONG way since they first came to public attention.<br />I highly recommend this movie as a pure action and adventure vehicle. Screw the awards and just enjoy the movie!!
B007SGM084|5.0|VERY WELL WRITTEN STORY THAT PULLS THE READER IN RIGHT FROM THE START.  INSIGHTS THROUGHOUT THE STORY GIVE LITTLE CLUES THAT THERE IS MORE GOING ON WITH CHRISTIAN THAN WHAT IS ON THE SURFACE. LOVE THE CHARACTERS, LOVE THE WHOLE STORY!  I LOVED THE ENDING, BUT HATED TO SEE IT END.
0345803485|5.0|I usually hate to read but like the Janet Evanovich series of books, I could not put this one down either. I stayed up till 3am on some days and although it felt like the story would never end, it only took me two days to read it only for my jaw to fall to the floor at the end. I still can't get that book out of my thoughts. You can feel the excitement and pain, the ups and downs all throughout the chapters of this book. I highly recommend it for those looking to spice up their life...

B002LLE3Q8|5.0|I first heard this album when I was a senior in high school in 1970. Since then I have bought this album many, many times; original released album, Mobile Fidelity half-speed master, Japanese vinyl, CD, and every anniversary CD edition. This 40th anniversary CD is a must have for any Crimso fan with a high end stereo. The audio quality is excellent. The most improved track IMO is Epitaph. The kettle drum in the introduction and cymbal crescendos are fantastic! Highly recommended!

0307341577|4.0|Gillian Flynn has quickly become one of those writers I have personally categorized as \\"special\\"--and that places her among Stephen King, John Irving, Margaret Atwood, and Wally Lamb in my highly idiosyncratic pantheon of favorite authors. I follow these writers' careers closely, and I read their works strictly in the order in which they're published--which is why I had to read this novel now, before I read \\"Gone Girl,\\" her latest, the one that has garnered widespread praise that I'm pretty sure has blown the lid off the secret that Flynn is one of the best at the craft of writing engrossing, non-supernatural thrillers.<br /><br />\\"Dark Places\\" is a fictional account of what can happen to a down-on-its-luck Midwestern family that gets trapped in the net of cultural paranoia. In this case, that paranoia involves suspected pedophilia and Satanism. Flynn very wisely chooses not to discredit these cultural mania that seemed to spread like wildfire in the 1980s, but she does exploit (and I mean that in the very best sense of the word) their power to propel persecution and create misfortune is those \\"dark places\\" that are especially susceptible to them.<br /><br />Libby Day, the not-very-likeable protagonist, survived the brutal mass slaying of her two older sisters and her mother in 1985. In 2008, Libby, now a screwed-up adult with an empty life, must confront her past and her role in the aftermath of the slayings, which led to her brother's imprisonment. Forced into the unlikely role of detective, she digs through her history to uncover a number of unsettling facts that eventually lead her to the sad and painful truth of what happened on that fateful night 23 years ago. In weaving this compelling tale, Flynn demonstrates that, as William Faulkner said, \\"The past is never dead. It's not even past.\\"

This book will creep into your thoughts long after you finish the last page.

0307454568|4.0|The final book in this series was by no means poor, but it was somewhat disappointing. The pace is lacking, the last chapter was not satisfying and Salander doesn't do nearly as much a**-kicking as I would like!<br /><br />Larsson also seems to get distracted by his great lists of things and lengthy descriptions. Much of it simply isn't necessary. Niederman's finale was awesome, but I felt that it was overshadowed by all the prior padding.

0062197258|5.0|I'm always looking for something to read and found this on the New shelf at the local library. I wasn't too sure when I was reading the trial transcript (which begins the book) but was quickly sucked in. The book goes from past to present every few pages but it isn't difficult to tell where she is in time even if you don't keep track of the time stamps. I always thought (like she mentioned in the book) that if a woman is being beaten that she should just leave. BUT reading this book and feeling her fear, I see how naive I was. Unbelievable that this is her first book - it's gripping
B007I2BZIE|3.0|I grew up with Rush in the 80's and cut my teeth on Power Windows, which came out while I was in high school.  I would have to say strong melodies and catchy riffs are what has been missing from Rush lately, especially on Snakes and Arrows and Vapor Trails.  They came back this time around and did a much better job, although it is just a little short of the older stuff.  The closest things I've seen on this to rekindling that old flame is \\"The Wreckers\\".  I also like \\"The Anarchist\\" and \\"Carnies\\".  \\"The Wreckers\\" would be my favorite in terms of having a very catchy chorus and it starts out with a real purpose from the beginning.  What's unique about \\"The Wreckers\\" is it doesn't sound like a typical Rush song, but that's why I like it.  A lot of the songs on here just sound like jams just put to lyrics.  Don't get me wrong I still buy anything that Rush puts out.  Every Rush fan has songs and albums that are very close and dear to their heart.  This is probably the most easily listenable/likable Rush release since Counterparts for me.  Again, I just miss the catchy melodies and unique riffs that happened in the 70's and 80's.  Intro's like Limelight, Spirit of Radio, Kid Gloves, Time Stand Still, Freewill all have those purposeful and unique intro's and riffs that I just love.  There are a few songs on here that I will grow to love as well.<br /><br />Favorite releases: Power Windows (followed very closely by everything else from the 80's and late 70's...and yes, I even love Hold Your Fire).<br />Least Favorite releases: Roll the Bones, Vapor Trails, Snakes and Arrows
B007X4N0DU|5.0|In an interview, Sonny talked about why he used the F-word.  [...] is the link.  but for those who don't feel like clicking it, he uses it for a good purpose.  Maybe you do not agree with it, but he is trying to reach out to the broken world outside of Christian circles.  he says the following in the interview:  \\"You've got to understand. We're not a band that plays youth groups and rallies. This is the real world. When some kid out there hears these verses, he doesn't think, Oh my god, you said the f-word. He says, \\"This guy's talking to me. Everything he says is relating to my soul.\\" The f-word is irrelevant; that's how some people talk. I'm not saying what's wrong and what's right; I don't talk like that. But when I'm talking to these kids, they're like, \\"Hey, man, I'm so f---ed up, dude. But I love f---ing God, man.\\"\\"    When will we as a church let go of petty things like this and give everything to sharing the good news of Jesus?  That is all P.O.D. is trying to do and all you people who criticize them are only hurting this precious opportunity for God to speak to the unsaved, hurting people of this world.    Also, this album is very good.  It is P.O.D.'s Style and sounds like their best stuff.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Excellent movie, and a tribute to those who go in harms way for all of us. Plenty of action that in my mind is believable. I can only say that because I haven't been there. It has made me think that we need to keep in mind those dedicated people who serve our country, and unfortunately give the supreme sacrifice,but also defeat our enemies. In the end, we can't support them enough, not unless we could be there.

B005LAIGW8|4.0|After viewing the original film i was left very disappointed and felt it was too goofy and lacked any good solid action this new installment I saw in the theater and when it was over I was very pleased with it David Saradys Score really sets the tone the look and feel of the movie is dark and gritty which is exactlty how the comics are the effects are much better and the Rider has a more Menacing Apperance this time round not perfect but for me a better film then its predcessor .

B008FBMLRQ|4.0|Good live record. Some songs sound better than others, but in general I can say that you can feel the energy flowing from the stage to the audience and vice-versa. It gets better as it approaches to the end.<br />I'm not sure if I like the Wild Boys/Reflex medley; it's not bad, but I loooove orginal Wild Boys so much that I would have prefered to listen to the original song. Nice View to a Kill play, less electronic and more guitar.<br />Sound is live; I guess they will have made some arrangements, but it sounds like a gig. Not like the previous arena, that sounded great, but more like an studio record.<br />Wrapping up, if you a DD fun, you'll enjoy this record.

0553801473|1.0|SPOILER ALERT - although by this point in time that is certainly moot and they are \\"spoilers\\" no longer:<br /><br />Much and more has been written regarding Gorge R R Martin's epic saga \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\".  The masses waited with baited breath for years on end for the publication of A Feast for Crows.  Many were more than generous to Martin for that installment with hope that it was a fluke, that Dance with Dragons would set things right.  After all, Feast MUST be mere world building, focusing on \\"secondary\\" characters, intro of a seemingly endless array of new POV's, there must be some point right?  A big payday to come?  Well, sad to say that is not the case.  A least not in Dance w/o Dragons.<br /><br />I originally read Dance over a year ago - being one of the many leal followers of the Great Ser - who had to have this massive tome in hand upon its release.  I read.  I became confused.  I pondered.  Something was wrong.  Obviously I missed something.  I reread the previous books - then reread Dance - NO NO something was still not right.<br /><br />Let us journey back in time ..... back to July 2011 ..... the \\"fantasy nerd\\" in me is excited.  The mere weight of the book is exhilarating, thumbing through the pages my excitement builds as I see my beloved characters are finally back:  Tyrion, Daenerys, Jon ......I begin to read ........<br /><br />Warging -  ok not sure but I know this must be a key plot device.<br /><br />Finally a Tyrion chapter, water after a long dry spell,  OMG did I say water .... Ok, ok don't panic yet, drunk, dealing with guilt over killing his father, anxiety over Tysha, wait, wait, he is stuffed into a barrel (we all know Gorge is the American Tolkien so maybe this is his homage to The Hobbit/LoTR????) ...ends up in Pentos with Illyrio<br /><br />Daeny next:  why do I feel like I am watching GOT on HOB.  Obligatory/unnecessary sex act entertainment, Daeny with her breast bared, looks like ruling in Meereen is not smooth sailing after all (no reference to Tyrion's boat trip intended at this point I didn't know what was in store on that front), a bunch of new names (Shahaz, Reznak, Hizhadr)..oh my, I am already confused and rereading.....<br /><br />Jon POV next and not a total mess yet, but still early in the game.<br /><br />Bran:  will he finally find/meet the three eyed crow?<br /><br />Sad to say but in IMHO this book just never gets going or gives us much in the way of plot/character progression.  As has been stated brilliantly by many other reviewers for every step forward, it seems we take two back.  Tyrion never gets to Meereen to join forces with Daeny.  Daeny accomplishes nothing in Meereen and is actually weaker at the end of the book as she finds herself back on the Dothraki Sea where she has flown on Drogon (yes, Daeny finally rides her dragon but only after they had been imprisoned or MIA for much of the book).  Jon does not cement leadership at the Wall in preparation for a confrontation with The Others (who also are MIA) and is actually \\"killed\\" by his own men.<br /><br />All in all a very sad disappointment for me.  For years I looked forward to a continuation of the epic fantasy story that Martin introduced so brilliantly in GOT and continued in COK and SOS.  I believed that FFC was an aberration or possibly a labor of love for characters Martin cared for more than I  (Brianna, the Martells, the Greyjoys etc.) but no, we received much and more of the same in DWD.  How long must we eat cold, watered down  neep soup.  We need a hearty meal, Mr. Martin.<br /><br />Many positive reviews have expressed their opinions that these are middle/set up books, that Martin is still \\"world building\\".  I must take a different stand here.  While Martin has always been descriptive in his story telling, he was still able to advance the plot and move the story and characters along.  He did not do that in Feast or Dance.  In my opinion as a humble reader, I think the books should never have been split.  It should have been one book with appropriate editing.  Yes, this is Martin's story but we are his customers and he would be nothing without us.  We are within our rights as purchases to critique what we have bought.  If Martin were giving his books away, publishing the story free of charge on his website, then to be critical of his work would be disingenuous but this is not the case.<br /><br />In conclusion this book just left me feeling sad.  Characters I was once excited to read about now have no interest to me.  They have been dumbed down to the point that they are now cartoonish.  After my reread of Dance I tried to go back to read GOT again to see if any of the magic could be recaptured.  It was not possible.  After about 100 pages I stopped reading, boxed up my hardcover editions and donated them to Goodwill which seemed kind of ironic as I no longer have any goodwill for Ser Martin.plit.

B0063IH60K|1.0|Used to be a great app., but with the recent adds the app. has become almost unusable. The adds take over the screen.
0345803507|3.0|I loved the first two books, but this one just wasn't as good so I stopped reading half way. Will finish it eventually. But the series is very good.
0345803485|1.0|Disclaimer: I know this was a fan fiction of Twilight.  I know this was supposed to be a mindless read, hence why I picked it up.  I know this woman has never written a book in her life.  I know.  I also have never voluntarily not finished a book.<br /><br />I'm not going to summarize the book because if you're reading this review you've either read the book or know about the book and wanting another person's opinion.  It's not the S&M that bothered me... although actually I didn't even get to the S&M part before I decided enough was enough, this \\"book\\" is wasting my time.<br /><br />I'm not even going to make fun of E.L. James for repeating words over and over, especially since I heard that she made fun of herself about it on the Today show.  However, I will make fun of the publisher.  WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?  There is no plot, this is not even remotely realistic (the only thing the main characters have in common is their sexual desire for each other and you're telling me this will keep them going for the rest of their lives, err... for 2 more books? Please!), and the writing is complete and utter crap.  Quite simply, E.L. James makes Stephanie Meyer look like a Pulitzer Prize winner. I thought surely the negative reviews of this book on Amazon were being a tad over dramatic. Now I find myself days later wishing I hadn't spent the $10.<br /><br />Also, most of the people I've talked to or have heard that like these books are ones that generally (I emphasize generally because this doesn't apply to everyone) are not big readers.  This does not surprise me.

B0000019PA|1.0|I get it. This stuff is emotional, rich in its lyrical content. Anne Frank. Yada yada. I've read numerous analyses about the songs on this album.<br />But lyrics are only half of the music, right?<br /><br />In case you're new to this band and this whole genre, don't expect any pleasing harmonies or nice riffs or earwormy suspensions or pleasant ambience or catchy beats. Just forget everything you know about music.<br /><br />Welcome to the world where people who can't sing sing anyway and rub it in your face. And it's not even \\"I'm singing off-key because I'm trying to be emotional\\". No, it's \\"I'm singing off key because I can.\\" Yes, if you were wondering, the same goes for the guitarist, the bagpipist, even the freaking singing-saw player. Yes, a singing saw.<br /><br />I admit - the \\"lo-fi\\" sound produces a terrifying effect. Which I believe was intentional. But boy, could there be better ways of producing terror through sound. This is not just terrifying - this is horrifying. It literally makes you cringe and poke at your ears as you try to figure out what the eff is tickling your eardrums, and when you find out that the answer is literally \\"everything about the music you're listening to\\" you just get angry and angry and angrier.<br /><br />I get that this stuff is significant. I get that it's emotional. But only the lyrics are emotional, not the music. Truly emotional music makes good use of both elements. This is only half of what music is.

B0052VUNHC|1.0|I don't like giving out negative reviews. I really don't. Obviously, I was hoping I'd like this book, or I wouldn't have read it. Even now, I tried to think of a reason to give it more than one star, but I just couldn't do it. This book was a disaster alright, but there wasn't anything beautiful about it. This book DISTURBED me. And not in a good way. I can't even say for sure why I finished, except that it was one of those train wreck books. I wanted to put it down, but I just had to see what happened in the end. Seriously. The best words I have to describe this book are TRAIN and WRECK.<br /><br />The whole story revolves around the relationship between the main character, Abby, and the resident man-whore on her university campus, Travis. It starts off very cliche: he wants her, she tries to resist, etc, etc. And THEN ***SPOILER ALERT*** when they finally do get together, it's this tumultuous, roller coaster of unprotected sex and fighting. Travis' whole world revolves around Abby and Abby is constantly trying to save him from his inner demons. And the whole time they justify their behavior with these four little words: I F***ING LOVE YOU!! Yeah, cuz nothing says \\"love\\" like selfish, destructive behavior. NOTHING about this relationship was healthy. This was a case study in co-dependence and unhealthy relationships. The thing that KILLS me about this...is that the author even labeled their relationship co-dependent in the book!! If you know it's such an unhealthy relationship, why promote it like it's this amazing romance? ***SPOILER ALERT*** Big whoop, so they get married at the end....when she's 19 and they've known each other less than a year. After she's compromised all of her convictions and done all the things she'd swore she'd never do earlier in the story. Getting married doesn't make their relationship any healthier. And don't even get me started on how the book ended by implying that Abby was pregnant. Ugh.<br /><br />I haven't been this disturbed by a relationship between characters since Bella and Edward.<br /><br />Oh, and did I mention that Abby is an expert poker player with mob ties who once dated an aspiring youth pastor? And Travis is a UFC-style frat boy fighter with anger issues the size of Russia? Occasionally, I come across a novel in which the main character gets on my nerves, or sometimes it's the love interest. But in this book...they both annoyed the crap outta me. Case in point: In what universe is it smart to have unprotected sex with the guy who has slept with most of the female population in your school? I mean, really?
030758836X|5.0|I am a Gillian Flynn fan and have loved the other books.  I didn't think that they could be topped, but this one is the best book I have read all year. I couldn't wait to get to the end...and I hated to get to the end because I didn't want to not have this book to read.  This is a complicated story of a marriage (more complicated than most I assume since it involves crimes) that has really gone off track.  Amy and Nick have serious problems and just when you think that one of them is more screwed up than the other, they surprise you.  There are more twists and turns in this book than you can imagine and the things that Amy is capable of will never cease to amaze you.  This book is so well written and the story so compelling that you will be entirely engrossed.  I just loved it.
0345803485|5.0|This book is a very addicting.  Once you start reading you can't put it down.  I thought I'd give it a try and order the others in the trilogy after I read a little-- save yourself the waiting- order all three at once!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is simple to play In the beginning, but gets pretty complex.  Beware, you will get addicted to this game.
0316287059|5.0|Not only does this book explain step by step for several different makeup effects and illusions, but the photos are amazing. I have it on my coffee table and all my girlfriends love to look through it. So its also great for those people who love pictures.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This is a very fun game to play and it is casual, too. The big problem is that each task costs energy, so it isn't long before you are waiting a few hours before you can continue playing. My biggest complaint is that the iPad and Android versions of the game have free cash buttons, but the kindle/amazon version does not. This is frustrating because a lot of items cost 'cash' to purchase them. I do not want to have to use real money to buy cash, when I could get free cash on other devices. I'd really appreciate an update.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|this is kid friendly i think it is funny.  you do not see much of the smurf town because they go to new york.  through a portal this is just like the T.V. show.  but this is real life only difference.  check this out.

B005YVSIZ4|4.0|Good story line.  Walking Dead is about more than just killing zombies.  It's more about the human will to survive and just how far one would go to protect the ones you love.  Would we sacrifice our humanity.  Good episode.  Looking forward to season 2.
B005WTR4ZI|1.0|The ideas are all right. But I read it in under an hour. It's hardly a book; a pamphlet is more like it. My review is 1-star because it's not worth the price. Free, or at most 99 cents would be more appropriate.
1439157383|5.0|I read the book first and then went for the movie and what a letdown the movie was - COMPLETELY different ending. WHY? I was so annoyed. The book was awesome.
034580404X|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy is tantilizing and captivating read.  Once you start reading it is difficult to put down.  It is an unusual love story bordering on the dark side.  It is definately worth reading more than once.

0740748475|5.0|My young daughter has, literally, worn out eight of the individual Calvin & Hobbes comic books.  The pages curled, the covers came off and... well, we're talking about a child using them.. and using them well.  I nearly purchased this set used from eBay several times before I decided on buying a brand new set instead.  I'm glad I did.  She has, surprisingly, taken very good care of it.<br /><br />She has read and re-read them all several times and they are still in excellent condition.  I chalk it up to the hardback binding and the heavy stock paper used in the printing.  If my avid little reader hasn't destroyed it in the nearly two years that she's had it, then I can say without a doubt that it is VERY durable.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book!! I could not put it down... I read it at home, at work... everywhere I could! Sure some things are repetitive but its still very intriguing!! Buying next two books as we speak!
1932100660|5.0|The China Study is referenced in another book I am reading... Eat for life. Although I am older and mostly set in my ways; I look forward to making the changes necessary to living a more healthful life. Thank you to Dr. Campbell for his study and findings. I am grateful for the education I have received reading this MUST READ book.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Received the disc a few days ago and have already listened to it about 10 times. This Album is AWESOME. Sure there are some songs i like better than others, but name me one album where that is not the case. Overall I would highly recommend this CD, even if your just a little bit skeptical from other reviews, at least give it a chance.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|Disclaimer: I loved Mamma Mia!<br /><br />I was excited about this movie based on the music/era alone. I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />It's silly, funny, ridiculous, over-the-top, and goofy. And it's an absolute blast.<br /><br />I was incredibly skeptical of Tom Cruise in this movie. But you know what? He.Was.Awesome. Made the movie for me (along with Hey Man LOL)<br /><br />Can you believe I didn't know Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand were in it? Both of them were terrific as well, and did not disappoint.<br /><br />I'm not overly familiar with Julianne Hough, outside of the Footloose remake, and I've never heard of Diego Boneta, but he was cute and I thought he did a good job.<br /><br />I really liked this movie, so much so that I went back a week+ later and saw it again. I can't wait to buy it, so hurry up and release it, New Line Cinema!<br /><br />Don't go into this expecting Oscar-worthy performances; you'll be disappointed. But if you go expecting fun and laughs? You're good. People need to chill out and not think every movie should be some life-changing experience. Sometimes stuff can be so bad it's great, and this is one of those things. Love it!
B006XBSAP2|4.0|The product was received very fast even before the dates it specified I would get it. The CD was sealed and new. I would buy again from this vender.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Absolutely LOVE this game! No problems with it so far! NEED to try Doodle Farm and Doodle Devil! All so amazing! LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this game!
B007MDB71O|5.0|Great story line and special effects.  The more I watch it the better I like it..  but I'm not a movie critic, I just like to be entertained by wayout fiction.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|I have not been able to get this album out of my ears since I bought it. It begins quietly and catches you immediately. I'm recommending it to everyone I speak to about music. Apple goes from soft to hard and everywhere in between with marvelous fluidity. Everyone who loves music should hear this album.
1594203059|1.0|Friends studying political sciences recommended the book, so I bought it.  I am a European, born in Africa, educated in Poland and Germany, have worked and lived in the East and living now in Brazil. I am very much interested in history and West East relationship. But I must say I was deeply disappointed. The writer of the book knows quite a lot and had done a fine research work. But the book is bitterly des-organized. As an example: in one paragraph of, let's say, 12 lines, he approaches three items, very often not co-related.  This confusion goes on and on. Ferguson should have given the book to one of his students for academic structuring. This negative claim addresses itself to Penguin Press.  I read the whole book, but was not pleased. I don't recommend the book. There must be better publication on the market.
030758836X|5.0|Downloaded this to my Kindle less than a week ago, and finished it today! Such fun to read! The story is delivered from the voices of the two main characters, Nick, the husband, and Amy, the wife. A woman, Amy, is missing. Where is she? The clues  seem to lead to murder, and who is the prime suspect? Nick, of course. Where's the body? Nick writes from the day his wife disappears claims innocence. We read Amy's diary which starts with the beginning of her relationship with Nick. A true love match. The reader gets hooked and that why it is so difficult to put the book down. It is best not say much about the book. You need to read it and have the fun of following this convoluted relationship and the mystery yourself. I don't think you will be disappointed. Love books that take place in the immediate present.

B000UU4NE4|5.0|There are very few films that everyone in my family can enjoy, and a film that my father isn't complaining at the end of is one of the rarest things I can think of. Spider-Man 3 was one of the very VERY few films my father not only isn't complaining about, but actually praises and will watch again and again and recommend it to other people. Even I loved it, and I am beginning to get tired of most of these monotonous effects-driven sci fi movies. Spider-Man 3 was anything but monotonous and effects-driven, having an original plot and a look unique to it's own self. I could actually point this movie out in a crowd, which is more than I can say about many other sci fi movies these days. The special effects were not the only decent things in this film, and even with the INCREDIBLY HIGH EXPECTATIONS everyone in our family has, every single one of us loved it. One of the most remarkable effects in my opinion was the large robot that the villain controlled. It was absolutely frightening. Tobey Maguire may not be the handsomest guy, but he's a good actor, I think, in this film. My father especially loves that \\"I knew you'd say that\\" line that Tobey Maguire keeps letting out with-and it is, in fact, one of our little family sayings. I would recommend anyone to watch this, if they craved a visually stupendous, action-packed film with an smart and original storyline-and had the intelligence to appreciate it.
B007NUP6GS|5.0|The great BWV catalog of Bach's music groups six shorter vocal pieces together as \\"the motets,\\" though scholars debate whether there may have been more of them, now lost. Unlike his major choral works and cantatas, there is no accompaniment provided for most of these, so there's no consensus about the use of instruments in their performance, either. All agree, however, that these brief pieces--apparently written for funeral or memorial services--display Bach's art in miniature. I always enjoy listening to the Monteverdi Choir, but I had to marvel at the lightness of some of the singing in this recording. (They make it sound so easy!) Although the music often seems to fly by, and there's a very dance-like feel to it, tempi are actually slower than Harnoncourt employs with a larger chorus. In addition to the canonical Six, Gardiner also includes \\"Ich lasse dich nicht,\\" a less intricate work. This comes in the usual SDG hardcover album with texts and essays.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|The only thing I ask is to PLEASE add a method to download a remote file to the mobile device, and also to upload one back to the desktop.
0099579936|5.0|I liked the book. Think all the people who do not like it should try to write there own books and stop putting down others. Not every story is going to be liked by everyone. I think there great.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I have tried alot of office apps with this being the best and most compatible so far.  Access to Google drive and my box.net files is a huge plus, and its the only mobile suite so far that let me access a password protected excel xlsx file.

034580404X|5.0|These books are great, the story line in them is so romantic and passionate, well written cannot wait for more of the same from this writer.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Forgetting anyone's opinion of the movie, or of anyone's opinion of the actors in it (*cough Tom Cruise cough*), plain and simple, this album is awesome.<br /><br />If you left the theater wishing you could magically get the songs from the movie exactly as they were, but on a disc, this is IT! All songs are complete, amazing, and one one disk (perfect to keep in your car on repeat forever).<br /><br />Pros:<br />--There is no dialogue from the movie in any of the songs. Examples being: no Russell Brand talking during \\"I Can't Fight This Feeling\\", no Mary J. Blige spouting dancer's names in \\"Any Way You Want It\\", etc.  There's no mumbling of Malin Akerman untying laces with her teeth during \\"I Want to Know What Love Is\\", either, a plus because of how weird that would be to hear every single time.<br /><br />--Audio is great, not flat like some soundtracks are. There is depth, a MUST in an album 100% rock and roll.<br /><br />Semi-Cons:<br />--For die-hard fans who wanted every single snippet of music placed on a disk, there are only two songs missing (that I noticed). Diego Boneta singing the beginning of \\"Don't Stop Believing\\" under the Hollywood sign is absent, as well as the Scorpions' \\"No One Like You\\", playing in the background when Tom Cruise finds Malin Akerman at the bar. Not a deal-breaker for me at all, just something a little sad to miss.<br /><br />Overall, I love this CD to DEATH!!! If you liked the movie's songs, this soundtrack is great. One of the best soundtracks I own, and one of the easiest musicals to get friends to listen to in the car. I WANNA ROCK!
B002Z7FWBI|5.0|As a clint eastwood fan you can't go wrong with this box set of all dirty harry's films. One of the great things about this set is you see the evolution of the character & the changes in styles of action as harry takes on not just crimimals but the politics of being a cop.

0345803485|1.0|Christian has a surprise for me.<br /><br />We'd been making love - oops, that's not what he'd call it - for hours, and I'm ravenous. Christian normally wouldn't be caught dead in a kitchen, but he makes me wait in his chamber while he goes to get something special - a hot dog.<br /><br />When he comes back in, I stare in astonishment at the glistening wiener, it's skin crispy from the Foreman grill, my salivary glands answering instantly to the tantalizing aroma. The six-inch-long dog nestles within the creamy white folds of a roll, peeking out from beneath shiny curls of pungent sauerkraut. Despite Christian's obvious efforts to please me with this suggestive culinary display, I gently extract the dog, wipe away the mustard, and hold it up, admiring its length.<br /><br />\\"I wonder if you can guess what I'd like you to do with that wiener,\\" Christian says, huskily, as I feel myself respond, yet again, down there. I blush.<br /><br />Smiling mischievously, I part my luscious lips and painstakingly push in the hot dog. In and in and in it goes.<br /><br />\\"That's it baby, take it all, you can do it!\\" Christian cheers me on. He's often commented on my apparent lack of a gag reflex. I flush crimson.<br /><br />But I fear the full length dog will lodge itself in my pharynx, so I slowly withdraw it, pausing to bite my lower lip, drawing it away from its supportive frenulum, for I know this drives Christian mad with desire.<br /><br />I actually am quite hungry. I tilt my head slightly back, my eyes rolling back in anticipation, my mouth slackening as I moan in pleasure and take the tiniest nibble from the dog, slipping the slightly dented end of the fragrant frankfurter between my swollen lips.<br /><br />Christian watches, mesmerized. I then take several tantalizing bites, using my tongue to fashion the macerated pink flesh into a swallowable bolus.<br /><br />I gulp.<br /><br />\\"Here, let me feed it to you,\\" says Christian helpfully, as he locks my head in place withone hand and immobilizes my arms with the other, while using his feet to imprison my lower half.<br /><br />Down it goes, as my soft palate and larynx rise, my epiglottis closing like a trapdoor to keep the slick, gummy mass out of my lungs. Without my awareness, the longitudinal muscles in the wall of my alimentary canal contract, elevating my pharynx to embrace my meal. Finally, the muscles in my laryngopharynx relax, sending the food plummeting down the 6 inches of my distended pharynx into my waiting esophagus. It all takes just 10 seconds.<br /><br />The act of swallowing is so intense that my breath hitches. I turn magenta. Crap! I'm sweating. Christian backs off in apparent disgust. Double crap!<br /><br />I listen to my inner peristalsis propelling the food to the sphincter guarding the entrance to my stomach. And as that virgin bolus splashes into the vat of churning acid, I venture yet another bite.<br /><br />Fascinated, Christian comes towards me again and holds my hands, twisting my forearms, firmly behind my back. He then pulls up my tank top and places his ear above my umbilicus, trying to hear the distinctive sounds of mechanical digestion.<br /><br />Unsatisfied, he pulls away, a frown on his gorgeous face. I've displeased him. I bite my lip in distress.<br /><br />\\"Why don't you have something to drink?\\" he asks as I try to stifle a stinky belch and hold in a fart. \\"It might help your digestion.\\"<br /><br />\\"Can I have my hands back?\\" I ask, and he lets me go, walking over to the table to pour me some ice water. Good, I haven't angered him.<br /><br />\\"Here, wash it down. Then brush your teeth again and you can sleep.\\" Christian, of course, never sleeps with me, not since that first night, before I signed the contract to be his Submissive.<br /><br />I drink, and I sense the food and tea distending the pleated rugae of my stomach wall. I can only imagine the intricate activities transpiring beneath my taut and tanned abdominal muscles.<br /><br />Christian playfully slaps my rear, and I head off to bed. I'm asleep in seconds. But my gastrointestinal tract is just getting started.<br /><br />Sphincters close off my stomach, entrapping the hot dog remnants in an acidic brew, as my contracting muscles slosh it back and forth. I recall from my long-ago biology textbook: \\"Waves of peristalsis push food against the stomach bottom, churning it backwards, breaking it into pieces, and mixing it with gastric juice to produce a semifluid mass called chyme.\\"<br /><br />Aware that chyme expelled from my stomach, should my inner peristalsis reverse herself, would be barf, I recall again from biology class that the protein will stay there for about 3 hours, but the fat - damn Christian, he didn't give me a fat-free dog - will stay there for 6. I'm not even aware of the gastric juice pouring from 40 million or so cells lining my inner stomach wall, rich in water, mucus, salts, hydrochloric acid, and digestive enzymes. What's more, when the hot dog first hit my stomach, endocrine cells in the lining cleverly released the hormone gastrin, stimulating even more gastric juice to flow.<br /><br />Isn't the body just amazing? Jeez.<br /><br />Eventually, the gastrin triggers nerves to relax my lower stomach sphincter, and my meal squirts into my small intestine, where all the action is. Once the chyme's all in, the exit from my stomach snaps shut. Holy shit, what control!<br /><br />As my quasi-digested hot dog makes its way through my duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, splashing back and forth as painless contractions riddle my gut, secretions from my liver and pancreas pour in, dismantling the dog further so that it's nutrients can be absorbed through my velvety villi.<br /><br />By the time I wake up mid-morning and Christian forces me to eat - he has a thing about food - last night's hot dog has made it's way to my large intestine, where it'll hang around most of the day. Since it's the weekend, I remain at Christian's, available and eager for whatever he has in mind.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the hot dog, minus its absorbed nutrients, sits in the 5 feet of my large intestine, which encircles the twisty 23 feet of my small intestine like a man spooning a woman following sex, although Christian would never do that. But I've read about it.<br /><br />Whilst in the large intestine, water, minerals, and electrolytes are leached from the hot dog, leaving behind the makings of a bowel movement: cellulose, bile, intestinal cells, and the 500 bacterial species of my personal inner microbiome. The bugs crank out a few vitamins, break down any remaining nutrients, and demolish remnants of the xanax I took yesterday.<br /><br />As I go about my day as a sex slave and slacker, the BM builds surreptitiously, collecting in the 6-inch tube (why is everything important 6 inches long?) that is my rectum, pushed by my inner peristalsis, operating now at both ends of the alimentary canal.<br /><br />A day comes and goes, and by Sunday morning, the entity formerly known as a hot dog enters my anal canal, guarded by dual sphincters. The outer one, which is voluntary, awakens me.<br /><br />\\"I have to shit!\\" I say aloud, to no one in particular.<br /><br />Off I go to the palatial bathroom and sit on the throne. Instantly, much to my relief, the inner, involuntary sphincter lets go, and I explode, to a cacophony of farts. It seems an awful lot of biomass for one measly hot dog, so I wipe myself, stand, and turn around. I peer into the bowl as I flush.<br /><br />And there it is. I watch, entranced, as the tapered turd that represents the wonder that is my digestive system, having absorbed all that is valuable and neatly packaged up what is not, spirals elegantly down the drain. A satisfied smile on my face, I gently lower the lid, turn to the mirror, and see, in abject horror, that Christian Grey has been watching me the entire time.<br /><br />Crap!
B008B1W3V4|4.0|Yes, it's a different sound.  Listening to this initially made me think of U2's \\"Pop\\" album.  It was a radical change and was pretty much universally hated at the time it came out, as well.  But, many of the songs from \\"Pop\\" are memorable.  Will that happen to Maroon 5?  Enough of the broken heart songs, though.  Can't these guys find happiness?  Do they want to turn into the Black Eyed Peas?<br /><br />The songs are synth-heavy, and short in length, which make them very radio-friendly, but ulimately lose a lot of the funk and swagger Maroon 5 USED to have.  It's been a slow transformation since \\"This Love,\\" but this new direction shouldn't be a surprise after their last album, \\"Hands All Over,\\" (especially Moves Like Jagger) and the Success of The Voice.  Adam seems to like being popular and relevant, instead of bad-ass, rock and roll.  I can't fault the band for that, their experiences have changed drastically since the early days.<br /><br />All in all, I do recommend the album, especially for the $4.99 I paid, but it's tough to listen to it straight through, as many of the songs sound similar.  I plan on making CDs with songs from all of their albums, to combat the pop overload.  Hopefully, they've gotten this out of their system and can get back to the funk that was evident in \\"Songs About Jane.\\"
1901464253|5.0|This book provides an excellent review of the history of the Brompton, plus it offers tips on using and maintaining the Brompton, and it provides details on how the Brompton is made.  Therein lies the difference between 'any-old' mass-manufactured folder, and the Brompton.<br /><br />The Brompton is hand-manufactured to customer specifications.  I like that.  In addition, the book also provides pictures to back up the details.<br /><br />If you are a collector of folders, this book provides Brompton Frame Serial Numbers in the Appendix, providing a range of frame numbers, and approximate date of manufacture -- very very helpful.  In another portion of the Appendix, it gives you Profit and Sales Figures from 1987 forward.<br /><br />Given our global economy, and the deterioration of our environment, added to increased fuel costs, I'm betting Brompton's sales  begin to sky-rocket shortly.  Too bad it isn't listed on the New York Stock Exchange -- because it would probably be another  winner like Amazon.com<br /><br />Owning a Brompton, and having tried other, lesser folders, I speak from experience when I say this is a luxury machine, well worth its price.<br /><br />Through reading this book, you come to understand why that quality  IS  STILL  IN  the Brompton -- and it is nice to know that the term 'quality workmanship' and 'repeat customer business' and 'ethical treatment of customers'  are terms that still mean something, to some companies.  (See page 107, 2nd edition).<br /><br />Nice work on the author's part.  An excellent topic -- Bromptons!

B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I did enjoy this book very much for the most part, but as many readers said, I felt that the ending was a bit less than satisfying.  Oddly, the parts I enjoyed the least were the courtroom scenes. I love murder mystery usually, but, as much as these parts were condensed, I still found myself wanting to skim some of them.<br /><br />I was guessing up to the end what would happen with the verdict and the characters and I felt that the biggest tragedy of the book was between the parents and the loss of the relationships between them; not the death of Emily and the trial of Chris.<br /><br />The detail, as with any of Picoult's books, were astounding. She is a phenomenal writer. You can see the entire situation from each of the parents' perspectives, which is an amazing accomplishment in writing. This book's subject was definitely an area that very few authors would have ventured into, so I applaud the risk that was taken in writing this one.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend it to a friend. At the very least, it will probably suck you in like it did me and you'll read as fast as you can to the end. And let's face it, it's better than what's on TV these days.
B00151G08Y|5.0|I got this album before but it had no booklet in it. The cd case was also crackerd & that's not good. I decided to buy a new cd with eveything in it. It was perfect & I enjoy the songs on this album. For those who love Pendulum, I recommend you buy this album!

1401923127|5.0|Dr Bruce Lipton is an absolute master in his field and his devotion to helping humanity better their lives is something that we cannot dismiss.  His message is clear and easy to comprehend and I thank him so much because had I not discovered Dr Bruce Lipton, I could never have changed the course of my life.  Because of his remarkable content, he inspired me to write my books [[ASIN:B0084589HY The Poison of Self]]and [[ASIN:B008JA869U A Story of Love - The Power of Stepping Into Your Vulnerability]]- both books are driven by my interpretation of the teachings from Dr.Bruce Lipton and the power of understanding who we are at a cellular level.

B004132HZS|5.0|Best money I ever spent on a t.v. series.  The plots are rich and detailed and run seamlessly from one to the next.  The actors and actresses are outstanding and compelling.  It makes me want to nominate it for an academey award or award at the Cannes film festival.  When you are done you feel like you watched a brilliant movie at the movie theatre.  I can't recommend it highly enough.  It's better than the Holmes movies.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was on the edge of my seat and could not put this book down.  I was worried that it was not my kind of book, but the events were handled so well, they did not bother me.  I am not a fan of science fiction, but I felt this book was not \\"far out\\" and the events were very probable.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|This is money well spent.  Truly funny and facinating shows.  Don't step out of the room for food or relief, because you will miss something important later on. Please keep in mind that this series is not appropriate for children under the age of 13.
