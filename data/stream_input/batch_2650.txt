B000005RXH|4.0|Looking at the cover, I was hoping for something making it worth leaving the cover where parents could see it.  I found myself putting the album away however without any acknowledgement that it was in my collection.

B004VMVTNU|5.0|I am the type of person who sleeps through alarms constantly or just turns them off and falls back asleep.<br /><br />This alarm offers much customization which allows you to create the perfect alarm for yourself.<br /><br />Personally, I set the alarm to a song that gradually gets louder until it reaches 100% in 10 minutes, I don't allow snoozes, and I have to do math problems to disable the alarm. The math problems make me focus enough that I am actually awake, rather than just smashing at the screen randomly.<br /><br />I have never had the app fail to go off for any reason.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Once you get going, it's a challenge to figure out how to find the items which unlock how you move on to the next floor.  Fun!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I could not put down the book once I reached the second half, there are so many plot twists, even in some of my least favorite POVs. And within all these new developments, the author is able to fill in some of the answers we had since the first book. But what make this book so good is that nobody is safe!
B000000OAC|3.0|I was looking for some charming songs like 'I'm in love with my car' or such, but after the chart-topping opening there is little to recommend this album.  The remix of 'We Will Rock You' could have definitely been left off.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|even with facebook's many issues i love i because allows me to connect with friends and family when ever i choose
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Great tool for passing news about my blog literally around the world.  It is convenient means of communicating.  I do wish there were 160 characters rather than 140

B0072OFM28|5.0|Wonted to finish out his collection. Has watch it from the being and just love this movie and can't wait for the last one.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|This book was pretty long.  I really enjoyed it though. But Sanderson is an excellent author.  He finished the Jordan series of books for the Wheel of Time series and did a very good job.  The same goes for this book.  I'm looking forward to the next in this series.  The only issue I have is the length of time Sanderson has between books.
B008645YXA|3.0|I have the other Cooper albums, and they will rock with their raw power.  This one however tends to lose its strength as the tempo tends to be dulled and what could be serious songs are mushed into soft things.  The only song of worth is 'Only Women Bleed,' and that is because it IS a slow song, so whoever produced it left it alone.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It relieves stress and anger in a positive way and plus the birds are cute. Hope I an access offline.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|i really love this movie... not only is it a charming space adventure love story futuristic fantasy, but it contains a surprising amount of biting social commentary softened by wonderful graphics and humor.<br /><br />regarding the 3-disc special edition, i just want to tell prospective buyers:  be careful when you first try to get at the discs.  the 3-disc set uses an environmentally friendly plastic-free package, but when i first tried to open it, it wasn't immediately clear how it works and i came close to accidentally ripping one of the pull-out flaps where the discs are located, because i thought i had to pull harder to get at the discs.<br /><br />now that i know how it works, i appreciate the plastic-free design, so i thought i might help eager viewers avoid damaging their new acquisition.
B00B886412|5.0|A very well made video.  The concert itself was excellent - great effects.  Had no idea where or what<br />Ancient Kourion was.  Now I know.<br /><br />I was surprised at how quickly the video got here.  Shipper did very well.  No issues there either.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Love this game. Challenging yet not too much. Makes you think, but still lets you have relaxing fun.  Simple but good graphics.
B009POHHPS|5.0|Seriously one of the greatest comics I've ever read. Geoff Johns has outdone himself with this one. I don't want to give too much away but time is everything in this novel. Everything happens for a reason. Also loved Thomas Wayne.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|easy to use and it shows each step along the way. Kindle Fire screen makes numbers large and easy to read
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is great book in the series of three. My kids have read this more than few times and all of us have enjoyed it.
B00BUCW54Q|3.0|This was presented as an action movie where the action was very weak IMHO.  Some people may like this film but it was to slow for me.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was recommend to me after the movie was release on direct tv.  I watched the movie and like the story but put off reading the book until a couple of weeks ago.  Of course, the book was so much better than the movie.  There  are a lot of difference between the the book and the movie. This is a must read!  Great book and one of my favorites this year.
1451648537|5.0|There is nothing more I can add that has not already been said about this book.  I found it interesting from start to finish even though some reviewers suggested that there is some repetition.  I never felt that.  Isaacson did a wonderful job tying together personal experiences with his vision and products.
B007ZYK3CE|5.0|While watching this intense movie I came to understand some of the negative reviews posted online here, even as I wholeheartedly disagreed with them. Yes, the movie starts out with the central, widowed character kicking his dog, carrying it home, and watching it die, as the animal stares reproachfully at his drunken master. And yes, a woman is pissed on, as she feigns sleep on the family sofa. Letting us know from the outset what her life is like at the hands of her abusive husband (not the same guy). The scenes are brutal, yet altogether honest. Bleak to be sure, yet somehow it all works out in the end. Not in some nice, tidy Hollywood manifestation, mind you. But certainly in how the real world works. Sure, the main character is hard to watch at times, as he rages against the world, but if you stick it out until the end you'll be rewarded for the effort. He does indeed feel remorse for his terrible deed, and tries to mend his ways, but in the end the story comes full circle. Can't tell you more without ruining the startling ending. Amazing performances by the two lead actors. I can't recommend this one highly enough. Loved it so much I went ahead and purchased the dvd.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have read most of Tom Clancy and Threat Vector is the most balanced, most engrossing, totally fun, completely thorough and satisfying story to date.  He can't top this one, I only hope the next is as good.

B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Starts out very good.But just when you get interested in the game It's  over. You have to Buy Full Version. If I had known the game was so short I would not have wasted my valuable  space on kindle.
B00DIXEZTI|5.0|Note: I saw every episode in HD via XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />Not a sequel to the motion picture Hannibal, but a prequel to it, the classic chiller Silence Of The Lambs and the terrifying Red Dragon & a satisfying sequel to Hannibal Rising, this television series is perfectly cast, and well-written. The singular way our culinary expert of a psychiatrist is introduced will literally send chills up your spine, and perhaps a smirk to your face. Each episode is full of surprises. It's a shame, though, that the fourth episode was unaired here in the U.S.A., due to a request by the series' creator. I don't see anyone complaining about the season finale of PERSON OF INTEREST (a very brilliant show created, written produced & directed by Jonathan Nolan, the younger brother of screenwriter, producer & director Christopher Nolan, and co-writer of THE PRESTIGE, The Dark Knight & The Dark Knight Rises), which was thrilling, and featured an explosion at a ferry. So, why Mr. Fuller decided to pull the fourth episode, for fear of the associations of recent events the episode might have triggered is baloney, in my opinion. I'm not making light of the tragedie, I'm just saying, to use it as an excuse to pull an episode of a successful television program is stupid. The final minute of the season finale will undoubtedly cause a smile to come over your face. I personally think it was an homage to Hannibal Rising, Silence Of The Lambs & the motion picture Hannibal.<br /><br />God Forbid We Become Friendly. I Don't Find You That Interesting. You Will.<br /><br />HANNIBAL returns next year.<br /><br />Ta-ta,<br /><br />H.

B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|true story  good writing  good acting  great effects.vert good movie.only not so good was Naomi watts. would see it again
B00000G3PL|5.0|In the first film, they couldn't stand each other. In the second go-round, they didn't take any crap. The third time around, it was all out war. By the fourth and final installment, they were a family. Yes, I'm talking about Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover). Each installment in the series is full of surprises, and they are all helmed by the man who made us believe a man could fly in SUPERMAN; THE MOVIE (and he was unfortunately fired in the middle of filming Superman II), Richard Donner.<br /><br />I shan't say more than what I've teased above, but I will add that the Director's Cut of LETHAL WEAPON is pretty good, adding a scene that establishes Riggs' persona a little earlier than in the theatrical cut when he's with some drug dealers, and a scene that shows how lonely he is. The Director's Cut, though, is worth seeing On Demand. LETHAL WEAPON 2 adds a few minutes of footage, which were completely unneccessary, in contrast to the first film, and LETHAL WEAPON 3 adds two brief, but key, scenes that fill in gaps (but whether you think those scenes should have been kept in is a matter of opinion, and personally, I think Mr. Donner made the right call). I saw the Director's Cut of each film via XFinity On Demand Monday, Tuesday and today for the first time, and that is why I'm writing this review now. Personally, my favourite film in the series is the fourth one, but each movie is very very very good. Top-notch acting, great action, side-splitting comedy and stellar production values.<br /><br />Each film is rated R (the first two contain violence, language & brief sexuality/nudity, and the last two contain violence & language).

B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is fun and addicting. It takes a while to get going but overall this game is awesome. I highly recommend it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is a masterly written book that defies you to figure out where in the world you are headed now!<br /><br />As soon as I was sure of what was happening the writer would throw me a curve ball and I would start second guessing everything I had just been so sure of!<br />Well written, this story will turn you upside down and inside out but it won't turn you loose until you are spent and left gasping for air.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|This is a great album.  It is not clear how I am to review the seller since he wasn't singing or playing an instrument.  He got it to me fast and in good condition.

B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|The ability to change the color on the lighted logo is a nice touch, but it's only useful when not actually using the mouse, because your hand covers it and all the other lights stay blue.

0767817486|5.0|I watched this movie many many yrs ago & it left a significant impression on me.  My opinion is that all schools should make it obligatory to watch in class to give kids which are considering smuggling drugs a serious inside about serious repercussions to expect.  Watch this movie and it will make you think twice about doing anything like the young man in the movie did, which is based on a real story !!!!!

B00CQGU9GG|5.0|All ten CDs from the beginning of their career. Even as a huge fan I missed some of these albums . I was fortunate to see them in Rapid City, SD. One of the best concerts ever. It was held during the Sturgis bike rally. Everyone had a great time including all those wild bikers. I loved the touch of a group of sexy ladies dancing to Legs and other songs. Great touch . Lot of wonderful memories on those CDs. The price is exceptional. Highly recommend

B0059WTMLW|5.0|April 23, 2014 -- I have UPDATED this REVIEW in order to increase my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars<br />I have used this app regularly since I first rated it on July 2, 2013 - and I like this app even more now than I did when I first reviewed it!<br /><br />My compliments to the developers of this app for the app's spectacular appearance and reliable performance on my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />This app is easier to use than any of the other digital Sudoku apps and games that I have used in past years.<br />Since I have problems holding paper and pencil, I definitely prefer a digital version to a hard copy.<br /><br />I enjoy doing Sudoku puzzles most often as a way to distract myself and let my mind refresh itself.  I'm pleased with the \\"Very Easy\\" level of \\"Classic Sudoku\\" for that purpose.  When I want more of a challenge, I can go up to one of the higher levels (of Classic Sudoku).<br /><br />I enjoy the novelty of Sudoku varieties I've never seen before, such as the color and jigsaw layouts.

B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I think I was put off by the movie with Tom Cruise which I did not see.  Tom Cruise is two feet tall while Jack Reacher repeatedly said how large he was.<br /><br />Not a bad story, pretty predictable.
B0079J28NW|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie in years and was pleasantly surprised at the excellent quality of it on my television. Great price, too!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the nicest surprise I have stumbled across in a LONG time. Spread the word on this one! If you enjoyed The Passage, The 12, The Hunger Games or anything in those genres, this one will blow you away! I would put it up there with 1984, given how well-written it is and engaging the characters are. The only warning I have is to READ this one. I am an avid audiobook fan and there are 2 audio versions out there, but they are both fairly poor in narration. The 2nd set of books (Shift Series) has a much better narration.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Vince didn't make many recommendations by title; he recommended the author Eric Blehm as a good read. Absolutely a great book; don't leave home without it; and when your reading it, take notes on how to live a good life!!!
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Who knew that the person or persons chasing after Bin Laden was a woman, dead set on catching him. She did. I thought Jessica Chastain turned in a superlative performance and I was very impressed with the acting in this movie.

B00CF34B2I|3.0|The game is very good, but has 2 major drawbacks.<br /><br />1. The game seems to eat my battery on the kindle fire HD.<br />2. The multiplayer is just over Bluetooth.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Well written melodrama in the English tradition. Truthfully follows English heritage through WWI and the inner workings of a manor house.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|So much fun!!  I love this game.  Chomp all the swimmers and sharks you see.  Don't starve and grow big.
0143034901|4.0|Intriguing and complicated overlapping stories with many characters, this book is well written and translated, though it sometimes stretches credulity to the point of being science fiction.  The characters are well developed and have entertaining personalities.  It is too long to read in one sitting, and threads have to be connected each time one resumes.  Because stories overlap, the protagonist varies from one section of the book to another, but each reappears, though the evil character participates in everyone's story. It may require a future reread to feel comfortable with a thorough appreciation of the interlacing histories.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|So glad I could get my email from my kindle without any hassle. If you have gmail definitley get this app.

B00BRUYQFC|5.0|I enjoy listening to Justin Timberlake but this album is fantastic!  Every song has its own rhythm.  I especially love Suit & Tie and Let the Grove Get In.  These two are great!  Blue Ocean Floor is also another of my favorites.  I hope you try this album, you won't reqret it.  JT just keeps getting better and better.
B009NY43NY|1.0|This book is horrible. What an awful way to end the Sookie series. Ms. Harris must have wrote this one while asleep. Very disappointing. Thank goodness the show TrueBlood veered away from the books after book 4. Love the show!

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good wrap up to everything in the trilogy.  I only wish a couple of the characters who didn't survive had.
B001J2WNE4|5.0|I enjoy listening to John Legend, but this album is even better than his first!  I love to hear him sing and the music is fantastic!  If you have not heard him sing before, you must listen to this one to understand what you are missing.
0399224459|5.0|My pre-k students love this book!  Simple vocabulary and great illustrations lead to lots of conversation in the classroom and help students make predictions.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I enjoy history so this book was wonderful for me. I learned so much more about the Russian front than I have from reading previous historical fiction books. Most of the main characters were well developed so it was easy to follow their stories woven throughout the book. I think I enjoyed the first book of the trilogy more due to the fact that there was more violence in this book, which of course was due to the violent nature of the Nazis and Russian armies. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves historical fiction or books about the era around WW2. I am waiting for the third book to come out now!
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|its a nicholas spraks adaptation so you have to go into this with that in mind.<br /><br />typical chick flick and predictable but enjoyed it for what it was

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Love is a choice and very intentional. Falling in love implies that it happened by mistake. Standing in love describes a form of will an  intent. Understanding that relationships are work and must be reciprocal helps keep love alive. The 5 Love Languages are an invaluable asset to any and all relationships.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|The game tells you everything and its fun and enjoyable for anyone with a this game if u don't have it then you need to get it right away
B00AEFXV3E|5.0|This is the most understated (and best) performance of Anthony Hopkins.  He is convincing as a doctor who always craved success but increasingly desires to provide comfort and protection to this sad and mistreated victim of nature.  It could have gone over the top, but David Lynch was the perfect director to look beyond the surface into the urgency and immediacy of true alienation.  If you have a heart, you will feel sympathy for this character.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|As long as you don't go for historical relevence in this than it was pretty good.<br /><br />I liked the twist on the story but the whole thing just seemed silly and a bit predicable.<br /><br />The action was good but that was about it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Probably one of the best Horse games out there. You can earn Gems instead of buying them and that is not a feature on many other apps. If you are a horse lover, then I highly recommend this to you.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Very good game. I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Good puzzles without straining my brain too much. Fairly quick yet do have to look for stuff.<br />I do recommend it.
1451695195|5.0|I avoid religiously driven stories.  Too much desire to preach and convince the reader to believe as they do.  So when I saw this book and that it was written by a physician who was basically a scientist and skeptic , I thought  that I could relate to his point of view.  I considered that the book could be written primarily for financial gain, but then I thought, well, he is a Neurosurgeon and his income has to be in the upper stratosphere, so money would not be a number one reason .  His story is fascinating and his recovery equally fascinating.  I believe that I was just hearing that in August 2013 , a skeptical story is going to be published that questions the good doctor.  That will be interesting to read .  Questioning anything is always good.  But the story is riveting and the circumstances of his health at the time were dire.  He has changed his life to tell his story.  He believes that what happened is true. The reader can decide !
B00CWY76CC|5.0|haven't worked my brain like that for a while. kept me going. not too hard to where you got stuck or frustrated. can't wait for more levels!
B00377E5SG|5.0|**Spoilers below**<br /><br />I've always liked this movie, and repeated watchings only make me like it more. I like it so much that even though I already own it on DVD, I plan to purchase it for my Kindle Fire so I can watch it whenever/wherever I want. It's my second favorite romantic comedy of all time. (I guess I should disclaim here that I hated the original \\"Sabrina\\" pretty much from the outset. I couldn't find the humor in watching Sabrina try to kill herself and Bogey just seemed unsympathetic throughout. Worse, I watched it after I saw this one and by that time I was already pretty much in love with Ford's Linus so Bogey didn't stand a chance.)<br /><br />This movie is very well put together - lots of comedy, including plenty of perfectly delivered one-liners from Ford, and beautifully realistic romance scenes. The story scrutinizes both of the main characters in equal measure as Sabrina rethinks her assumptions about Linus and Linus sheds a lifetime's worth of emotional armor. Julia Ormond does a great job with a character that's often tough to sympathize with, naive and superficial as Sabrina can sometimes be. To Ormond's credit, Sabrina's romantic revelation sheds an entirely new light on the character (making Linus's ensuing confession all the more brutal).<br /><br />To my mind, though, the movie belongs to Harrison Ford. I had no idea the actor who played Han and Indy (!) could imbue Linus with such subtle, varied emotions. With only a look or vocal inflection, Ford telegraphs Linus's entire unspoken backstory along with the feelings he's locked away from the world for decades. Sure, Linus shouldn't have kissed Sabrina in the solarium - but boy, does Ford make us understand why he did it: not only was Linus attracted to Sabrina, he wanted, for once, to be the guy who gets the girl instead of the hard-charging, workaholic dealmaker. The quiet anger Ford shows during Linus's talk with his mother in the office makes us feel how hard it's been for him tobe the bad guy over the years - and how much he resents what it will cost him this time. Ford perfectly captures a man who, after years of accurately reading everyone else's emotions, is forced into an emotional crossroads of his own. By the end of the movie it's easy to root for the world's only living heart donor to step outside his purgatory and discover what he never thought possible. Ford's Linus is such an interesting, attractive, intelligent, perceptive, complex character that I found myself reproaching Sabrina for ever wasting one minute of her time on silly, boring David.<br /><br />A few more highlights and I'll have done:<br /><br />- The way Linus says \\"hello\\" when Sabrina drops off the pictures. His eyes light up and his voice softens, as though in that brief moment he couldn't hide his newfound feelings if he wanted to.<br /><br />- The looks he and Sabrina exchange right after he asks her \\"What will you tell him?\\" Her eyes beg Linus to understand what she can't say aloud. His answering look acknowledges her feelings and confesses his own - with no small degree of sadness that his plan has worked so well. It's a heartwrenching combination of desire and despair as Linus recognizes the next moment will bring him exactly what he's been wanting - and the moment after that will force him to throw it all away.<br /><br />- Linus's look of utter devastation after he makes his initial confession, his whole body sagging under the weight of it. He doesn't just tell the truth, he drags every last bit of his ugliness into the light so Sabrina can start hating him - and thereby getting over him - as soon as possible. To him, penance is as serious as any business deal he's ever done.<br /><br />Love it, love it, love it. Cannot recommend this movie highly enough.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is fun I have a small cabin and a lot of arrows for my bow.and I like how they have things come out at night.cant wait for more updates.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|This movie kept you interested, It was packed with mystery and intense romance while one really had to search within themselves to discover who they really were.  I have to say the ending blew me a way in a great way!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I appreciate being able to keep track of weather at many locations at my fingertips.  I have family in several locations and it is convenient to know if they are facing weather challenges.  Great for traveling as well.
B004LQEYAG|5.0|I love this movie. It is a classic, Teaming Redford and Newman in a Western that has everything. A must have in my collection of Westerns.
B0045I3EJC|5.0|I bought the film because it has Jared Leto in it but I also heard about how the movie was complex. I enjoyed it so much. It had great depth to it. Jared did a wonderful acting job as well.
1439102813|5.0|I will recommend this book to my friends also... I do not like the way I have to add more words to rate these books..
0375842209|4.0|I am long past being a young adult and I value good books.  This is one.  Don't be put off by that part of the description.  it is well worth the read.
087033039X|5.0|If there is a leather braiding technique out there, it is in this book. It is packed full of information and more braiding techniques than you can imagine.
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|This movie never gets old. If you haven't seen it lately, watch it again. If you've never seen it, this is must.  Cary Grant is timeless!
B003VR5PPY|5.0|Didn't have a single problem. Would deal with again. Game is AMAZING. You've never played a game like this on the DS before.
1781162646|4.0|Well-written with a plot that drew me in right away, I found this to be a perfect summer read. As many other reviewers have said, I found it difficult to put down.  My enjoyment of it recalled the first time I read my favorite King book of the 80s, Christine.  My advice?  If you like King, you'll like this. Find a beach somewhere, carve out a few hours (*g*) and take a trip to Joyland.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael Buble does it again!  This is an incredible Spring season music collection, and will most likely be my go to album as the weather begins to change again next year!  Great music, great sound.  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and the author.<br />I will be watching the movie soon. But I'm sure the book is way better, it always is.
1571200851|5.0|An interesting orgami folded fabric book with several flower styles and kimono patterns. Most patterns are wall quilt in size.
0515153656|4.0|Wow!  what a great first book for this author.  Superb plotting and excellent pace.  Sure hope that this continues through the other books.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved this game, very addictive.  My husband and I played it together, trying to get to the next step first.  We thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I love this album.  In their first major release, Alabama Shakes has struck gold.  It is a relatively short album, but every second is worth hearing.  They have a great 'fresh' sound and you can really feel the emotions that she sings with.  If you're into southern/blues rock, this is more than worth the purchase.  If you aren't, I would still recommend a listen to see if it is something you can get into.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|The scene where the plane is falling out of control is awesome but might make some people not want to fly again.  The rest of the story is entertaining as well.  Good drama.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved the previous books and this one didn't disappoint. I loved the storyline and would recommend. I would love for these characters to have another sequel!
B008OOYALE|4.0|It's to hard to Hard to get money and good dragon's so DragonVale is so much beater<br />But still a good game and stuff
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is very fun I'm 10 and it teaches my 2 year old sister how to take of horses because we really have them and she always asked to play this game though when I got more gems I clicked on the game to play it and it never let me load them it just said loadind gems for 2 days and I had to redonload it and lost everything but I recomment this game its fun for all ages
0307474259|5.0|This book takes apart the omnipresent world view that you lose weight by burning more calories than you consume.  His argument is that carbs make you fat.  Simple carbs make us produce insulin, which makes us store fat.  stay away from carbs and your body knows how to regulate your calorie consumption just fine by itself.  It worked for me.  I've been stuck in the 175 to 180 range with a big gut for years.  No matter how hard I work out I just can't get below that.  Since going low carb and high protein/fat the weight has melted off.  In two or three weeks I'm at 161 and my waist line is where most of that weight seems to have come from.  And I feel great.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|If you didn't like &#34;Inception&#34; you might not like this movie either.  The story seems to jump around a lot at the beginning so if you don't pay attention you will get lost rather quickly.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its great for a horse lover its entertaining and cool. if ya ask me I think its the best horse game Eva ; hey heard about the fireworks. yet
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Actually, I got this for my friend, who LOVES horses! she loves all sorts of games,<br />but especially horses, so I hope she likes it. actually, it isn't all that bad!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Cool game. Can be addicting. Doesn't require in app purchases to continue. My son's play it too. Doesn't have an annoying soundtrack and isn't one of those frenzied pace games.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is a great movie. I was really happy with the quality of the movie and the content of it.
B00CFQMVLS|3.0|Who knew that John McLane (sp) had kids? Who cares? This didn't show the usually charming side of Bruce Willis, like the rest of the franchise has. I don't know if the story is played out or if I just don't buy into the story line anymore. Not my favorite, but the action sequences were amazing and the location shots were great.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|best game EVA its the best you can do hair and design it you have you have to get this app its amazing. try it plz!
B000F8O2OM|4.0|At first I was not a Stargate fan, but when I started watching the series after the second season I started getting into it. Of course I didn't understand what was going on in some of the series, for instance double jeopardy until I watched seasons 1&2. Than everything started making sense. Love Stargate, the humor, seriousness, and the scientific approach to the show. I only wished the show expanded the idea of the retu alien instead of the orei.
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|Rented this for free from redbox.  Movie was as bad as Cold Light of Day.  Cheesy on top of bad acting.  Time to retire from acting Bruce.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|awesome games fun hard but not so hard that I you're stuck for ever it was quite enjoyable the puzzles for fun to figure out
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|An unbelievable true story, to show that life can turn on a dime, but what we all  have the capacity to do is survive and show compassion to others by helping them and we help ourselves in the process to fuel our spirit and feel good inside.
B0034G4P94|5.0|A fine film, breaking the usual martial arts film genre with a warm human interest story stresing forgiveness and reconciliation.<br />I would almost say it's a religious movie in the highest sense of the word.  Nolte's performance as the estranged father of the<br />two fighting brothers is superb.  My only fault with the DVD is the sound is too low on the film (okay on the supplements).<br />I had to turn on the cutlines to &#34;hear&#34; it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love how you have to care for the horse...to earn the right to show your pony.<br />Great lesson to learn.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I never thought about a calculator while using a Kindle until I need to complete some mathematical concepts. I decided to see if there was an app for a Kindle. This is the best app I have downloaded in a while.<br /><br />I love it!
B0028RXXFC|5.0|i am so enjoying this series, The box set is absolutely beautiful.....thank you so much will be looking for more<br />t
B002CPD5LC|5.0|This concert features a great tribute to a great and talented man.I didn't realize what a great career Quincy Jones had until I listened to this dvd. Besides great music there are some great musicians who pay tribute to him as well.A nice addition to my music collection.

B004IPPINW|4.0|Well written and interesting story line. A little surprising it parts, it comes to a rather abrupt end. I would recommend this book.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just a<br /> Fun game. I like finding the different way  the pieces fit together, here an  there. Great for many age levels.
0515142247|5.0|Lee Childs has become one of my favorite authors I start reading a Jack Reacher novel and it's hard to put down. I just bought the last three books and now have seventeen books in the series.Great reading !!!!!!!!!!
0307730700|5.0|I loved this book and could hardly put it down. So sad yet very uplifting too. We owe it too all troopers to buy and enjoy these types of true story books.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|My grandson insisted I download this app. I need lots of help in making any points. It's an old lady thing I guess, really for kids but I'll learn.
0143120530|5.0|The author's journey from reporter to participant in the World Memory Championships is full of funny anecdotes and fascinating characters.  The writing is tight, compelling and brilliant.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!
B001VS46DC|5.0|One of the great jazz artists of our generation.I have a large collection of Diana Kralls cds and this dvd concert disc makes my collection complete. Go out and buy it,you won't be sorry !!!!!!
B0097PW7H8|5.0|I own the granddaddy of battery eaters.  The HTC Thunderbolt eats batteries for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  My run time with usage is anywhere from 2 to 3 hours of solid workload.  I installed this and noticed an increase right away.  It isnt a miracle by any stretch but it is nice to be able to use my phone a little longer before it dies.  This thing is easy to use and is a solid device.  It has a one click check and you are optimized.  You can also mess with stuff on your own.  It is free which makes it even better.  It even warns you when you are using to much power and that you need to check up on some of your apps.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|Nothing to get the Red White and Blue juices flowing like this big over the top production.  Summer blockbuster at it's best.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so fun and challenges you search and think about the clues. Would definitely tell others to play.
B00064VR0W|5.0|A great concert dvd. I've been a fan of Rod Stewart ever since I can remember.What's so great about this dvd ,is that he sings his early hits then goes into his Great American Songbook playlist.There's something here for everyone. A nice addition to my collection.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is great for all ages! You can actually learn about the ocean! It is so fun, and I love getting new fish! Good background music! The only thing I didn't like was I usually wasted the pearls, so I had to buy more with real money because you need them for the quests.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|my 6 year old daughter got me hooked on this game.  I love it how it starts you slow and gets a little harder with each<br />puzzle
B007HC3LHS|4.0|This book was riveting; I read the whole thing in about 4 hours. Catherine Bailey meets Lee, who's gorgeous, charming, attentive, and seems to fall in love with her quickly. Everything is great at first, but Lee's behavior slowly changes, becoming increasingly erratic and violent, until Catherine is scared for her life. This book is told in alternating times, Cathy's life post-Lee, and her life with Lee, which made it a little hard to follow at the very beginning. Once I realized what was going on, though, it wasn't an issue.<br /><br />The sections that dealt with Catherine and Lee's life together were so creepy. You didn't have to read the synopsis of the book to know that there was something wrong with this guy. But Lee isn't just a bully, he's a sociopath. He manages to endear all of Cathy's friends, (they are the worst bunch of women I've read about in a long time. Absolutely awful.) and her co-workers into being completely on her side, all the while terrorizing her and beating her. Her parents died years ago, and she doesn't have any siblings, so she's on her own with Lee's abuse. Based on the OCD Cathy is dealing with in the present-day chapters, you know that there had to be some kind of final showdown between the two of them, and as you're reading, you can feel it coming like a freight train.<br /><br />The present-day chapters are almost heartbreaking. You just feel so much for Catherine and her constant checking and re-checking and re-checking and re-checking of the doors and the windows. Even the bathroom window, which she has to climb onto the toilet to check multiple times a night, regardless of the fact that it's been painted shut. Once she finds out that Lee has been released from prison, again, you have that freight-train feeling. You know he's coming for her, she knows he's coming for her, but you're still not ready for it.<br /><br />This is Haynes's first novel, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it, and any more that she has written.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|It was interesting reading about a white girl treated as a slave. I enjoyed the different take and how the character of the white girl never changed.
B009UMTMKS|5.0|Great book by Steve Blank. Answered most of my question and doubts of running my Startup.<br /><br />I expected a book focused only on customer development, but, instead, it was a pleasant surprise to see other topics as well.<br />One think that I disliked is the repetition of some phrases throughout the entire book, but I understand why it was made this way.
B005K17RU0|1.0|The update is terrible! They must change the layout and make navigation smooth!<br />Gonna switch to My Weather Channel if they won't
0143057375|5.0|Give yourself the gift of anything Eckhart Tolle.  He is a wonderful author and speaker that adds quality to everyone's life.
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|I wanted to get the app because other people liked it... VERY bad choice... I should have listened to the people who said no.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of my favorite games that I have. I like that they have new updates every month. character and other stuff can be very expensive. they have daily challenges, missions, mystery boxes, and much more. I would recommend you getting this.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very entertaining to work through. My only comment would be that it did not last long enough. Needs more levels.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love how the two main characters were always connected somehow. How their lives came together. This is a perfect story, a true romance!!!  It's a must read.
B00CKJTOHO|1.0|This series way dark.  It is not necessary to use such foul language.  Too sexually explicit.  Too graphic. Too twisted and sick.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Watched Man of Steel 3 times in the theater in my hometown.  The music that Hans Zimmer did was incredible.  Hope he comes back to compose for the sequel.
B007ZB06OW|5.0|This kit is incredible detailed for a kit of its size. The design and engineering of the parts, and the layout of the manual make this kit fairly easy and very enjoyable to assemble.  Almost 70% requires no glue.  One warning though. There are many tiny parts when it comes to the anti-aircraft guns.  Tweezers and careful handling required for the small parts, but don't let that deter you from buying and assembling this kit.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|GREAT, IVE  SEEN IT 4 TIMES SO FAR. NEVER GETS OLD. DON'T EVEN BOTHER LOOKING FOR THE OPRAH WINFREY VERSION, SHE KNOWS NOTHING ON THE SUBJECT.

B005HS4CUY|5.0|GREAT DEAL,  A MUST BUY, MOVIES YOU ENJOY TIME AND TIME AGAIN. I BOUGHT THEM IN ANTICIPATION OF HAVING A 3D TV LATER THIS YEAR.
0385472951|3.0|I considered the book a good John Grisham novel but I was not happy about the ending.  If you want someone to keep their expectations about a storyline, don't wait till the ending to throw them off.
B00A0HQ9GM|5.0|Buy it. You need it. Like a \\"Ride\\" in your favorite \\"Blue Jeans\\" off to play a \\"Video Game\\" while sipping \\"Cola\\"... we're \\"Off to the Races\\".
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I am not a big gamer-I am just trying to slow down the brain aging process!  This game really makes your brain think!
B009IAIBAE|5.0|CLASSIC, A MUST FOR TRUE MAIDEN FANS. THE BEST WAY TO LISTEN TO METAL. NEED THE ENTIRE COLLECTION ON VINYL ,THIS WAS MY FIRST MAIDEN ALBUM I LISTENED TO AND GLAD IT WAS. WORDS CANT EXPLAIN HOW GREAT THIS ALBUM REALLY IS, BUY IT NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The plot in Baldacci's stories always requires attention to the material so that one can catch or watch for possible clues as to the resolution of the story. It's never possible to find everything but it maintains the reader in suspense throughout. This particular story is fascinating, full of scenarios that could lead to answers but keep you guessing. The ending is, as always, surprising.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is awesome though I have been noticing that the game is weird and the jet pack is shorter than usual time period a few days ago I noticed that.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great adult game with light challenges to keep you thinking and on your toes. Very fun! Would not recomend for children.  It takes some time and critical thinking to link the clues.  Small details count!
B009IAIC5I|5.0|CLASSIC, A MUST FOR TRUE MAIDEN FANS. THE BEST WAY TO LISTEN TO METAL. NEED THE ENTIRE COLLECTION ON VINYL
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|You need to start with season 1 and watch them all.  It's hard to imagine that kind of lifestyle and living that way.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|this app is is so awesome and its way better than prom salon and wedeing salon.you should really get this app. if you like to create outfits than you would love this. the girls in it are so pretty. i just wish most of the things weren't  locked. anyway you should get this app it is sooooooo awesome.
B008220BP2|5.0|Not going to review the movie.  Since you are here reading this, you've seen the movie and are trying to understand what this bundle has to offer over the others.  This is a Blu-ray package with two digital copies: 1 iTunes download and 1 Ultraviolet copy.  Good already.<br /><br />The iTunes download is the HD version which is itself $19.99.  It comes with another 700+MB of extras that are still downloading.  Overall movie file size is 3.21 GB. Great.<br />The UltraViolet copy can be redeemed at multiple vendors but I chose vudu.com.  Vudu has three levels of quality: SD, HD and HDX.  This bundle comes with HDX.  Fantastic.<br /><br />This is the bundling that studios should be emulating...HD disc for home and HD portable version for on the go.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun free app!  This game isn't too difficult, but challenging enough to keep you coming back for more :) I definitely recommend to anyone looking for a fun way to pass the time.
0812550706|4.0|Definitely an interesting plot and characters.  The last chapter or two was way too long with little reward.  It could have ended much much sooner.  Don't think it's &#34;will definitely see the movie&#34; good, but an easy read that kept my attention and excited about what else would unfold.
B00AWJYJVA|4.0|Well written although a bit shallow is content. Also still clinging a bit to the Cold War days of Brit MI5
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Awesome game! A lot of fun. Not to hard and not to easy. It's very addicting. The game definitely needs more levels.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is cool and alsome have a graet time and so on so on shin Hebe a great time cool
B0009SOFFY|4.0|What can I say ? Another Good re-package by the Rhino Folks<br />Iggy's 2nd Album in it's glory.<br />I remember picking up my vinyl copy in a cut-out Bin for 1.50 sealed back in 72'<br />True talent stands the test of time.
B00322PK2G|2.0|The wristband had scratches on it and the watch was already ticking when I opened the case.  When I bought my other Swatch watch at the store, the wristband was not scratch and the watch was not set to tick yet, so I don't think this is a &#34;new&#34; Swatch watch.
B00594XOZU|5.0|So this app is awesome all u can text on it and guess what it has a word choice thing u can pick any smile face u want and take pics to send to your friend so fun and u can have a big conversation with all of your friends I just think this app is awesome so that's it I hope u guys buy this'd app for F R E E
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I never thought I'd say I liked a zombie romance movie, but this one is very fun and true to the spirit of the novel.  Thumbs up!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a perfect challenge to stimulate your brain without frying it. Great especially in the summer months for students to make their brains think and some fun challenges. Putting together clues to lead to the final unlocking of the elevator. It's an entertaining challenge :)
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I sew a lot and I alter,  adapt and resize patterns. This makes it so much easier to calculate new measurements because most sewing measurements are done in eighths. I don 't have to remember or calculate decimal equivalents in order to foible check my figures - I can just tap the numbers quickly into this calculator and I have an answer in the form I work with, and in decimal, too.  A memory function would be nice sometimes but I write everything down for future reference anyway.
B00DF0POXA|1.0|Anyone who gave this a positive rating, clearly has absolutely no taste in music. Not only are his lyrics completely uninspired, but every single beat he produced is monotonous, unoriginal and doesn't go anywhere. This is an embarrassment to Kanye and the genre.
B0081336FO|5.0|Moffet does it again with season 2 of Sherlock.  I cannot tell you how amazingly well done this series is.  A must watch!
B00004X10B|3.0|I just got this bag.. It looks well made.. I am not a fan of the overlap cover..cause you can't unzip fast with that system..but it seems well made and lots of small pockets etc..However: It I s Too Small for BIG Lenses and Big Bodies..You need to re adjust more than you should need to for a big camera bag.<br />My original Lowepro Pro bag was stolen..Miss that bag.. (yes with gear inside)..That bag in now discontinued.. So this one looked half decent..<br />This bag shows a whole lot of potential when looking at the photo on Amazon.. but in reality..it is just too small for the following..<br />Two dslr with battery packs..and two large zooms mounted will not fit.. I just tried with 2 Canon 5D's with battery packs-one with a 24-70 the other with a 70-300..and NO WAY NO HOW..and there's barely room for these big lenses to sit alone...This bag needs to be a little bit larger on all dimensions.<br /><br />The new Lowepro Pro that replaced the one I had is also too small and costs over 200 bucks..not worth it...I guess this Tam will do for now..
B00CL6HGIK|2.0|Story goes out of control.....wahlberg is always believable BUT russel crowe is bad as is Zeta-Jones.  The story has a couple good twists BUT you gotta be kinda desperate to choose this movie.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I like it but it needs to be updated for kindle fire,like it is for all the popular apple products.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this app so much!I think its really fun to play. you get to decorate your own princess and choose her dress ext... GET THIS APP!!:) :)!!!!
B00CS74W0C|4.0|I enjoyed this book, BUT when will the next book be ready I'm ready to keep reading with all that has taken place I have to read at least the last chapter of this book to be able to move forward with the next, What name should I look for with the next book and when can I purchase it
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Even in the tragedy of war compassion can be given.  If you like reading stories about the greatest heroes of our past, then you will enjoy this book.
B00005JMAH|5.0|This is a first, I actually had a DVD fail that could not be recovered.  There was not a single scratch on it to justify the failure.  I went to WB to ask for a replacement and quickly discovered that it would be more hassle and cost me more then just replacing the DVD through Amazon - so I did.  The Harry Potter series is great for all ages and I couldn't have a missing/bad disk ruin it.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this game. I normally don't like games like this, but this game I like...its greaat fun. just needs to work on the reaction time with the flight.
B009R659L8|5.0|Always enjoy her books and this one did not disappoint and had a great story line for easy summer reading.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Cool game but in the campaign the update for me seems to make the ai for the enemies stupid they are not smart I stand in front of them an  they don't even notice me
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If only people had &#34;got it&#34; with the original series &#34;Firefly&#34; and allowed it too succeed.  I guess this program was ahead of its time.  Anyhow, Serenity if the tie off and does a great job bring the series to a conclusion.  Perhaps (as others have suggested) they will bring back Firefly as a computer game using the original actors for voice work...
B003O86FMW|3.0|This second book is OK but I feel is not written as well as the first book.  I feel the author rushed the storyline.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I spend hours playing.  Love this game.  To set the scene, you get to choose your  hero, allies, weapons and your villain.  And the fight begins.
B001MSMULG|2.0|I have read most of Daniel Silvas books and have always felt them to be exciting and interesting, enter the Kill Artist.  This entire book had Gabriel as a meek, frightened man and if was Silvas way of getting rid of Gabriel and bringing a new star into the picture it was a poor way of doing so.<br />I read the book hoping it would get better.  It didn't.<br />Disappointed in Denver

1400052181|5.0|The book is well written.  I expect Skloot will in the future turn out other good works.  The story is riveting and the chapters are short and keep your attention.  It's almost like a good novel but you feel that the author tells it like it is.  I have close relatives in the medical research field and I am sure they have used HeLa in their work.

B002RZZIXU|4.0|Boyd's technique of interspersing chapters from past and present is an engaging way to both hold the attention of the reader and weave a plot of second world war spying intrigue involving a mother and daughter.<br />He is thoughtful in the way he develops his story and the final twist is delivered with artistic skill.<br />Boyd writes well and in this novel he holds the attention of the reader from the beginning to the end.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I used to play Magic a lot. But as I got older and busier, it's become harder and harder to find people to play against. So I get my fix nowadays with this game. Many play styles are included in this new offering. If you're a fan of Magic or have always wanted to give it a shot, you owe it to yourself to grab this game.

B00CSKQ5IG|1.0|Welcome to this, this is going to be a rant as part of my 2003 in film series & this rant is for Terminator 3 Rise Of The Machines. This is 1 of those movies that don't hold up well for me I saw it way back during the holidays in 2003 thought it was ok but then throught repeated viewings it's just gotten worse. That didn't happen with Terminator 1&2 in fact when I saw extended edition of T2 on DVD I thought it was better than the 1st. I think this is an awful movie. I feel that End Of Days & Collateral Damage were better Arnold Schwarzenegger movies. Last Action Hero which I reviewed last month for my 20 years ago series was better than Terminator 3 even recently with The Last Stand that was better than this movie. Back in 1996 when I saw both Terminator 1 & Terminator 2 on VHS I wanted them to do a Terminator 3. As the old saying goes becareful what you wish for you just might get it. There was no need for a Terminator 3 looking at it Terminator 2 Judgement Day ended everything on a high note. If they needed to do a 3rd movie then set it in the future during the war with the machines like Terminator Salvation did only make it more violent. I can admit Terminator Salvation wasn't perfect it's no where near as good as the 1st 2 movies but I was entertained by it. Ok let's get to this rant made on a budget of $170 to $200 million made $433 million. Directed by Jonathon Mostow the only movie I liked that he's directed was Breakdown. He also directed U 571. I don't blame Michael Ferriss or John D Brancato as much as Mostow but still they wrote some really bad dialouge. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator, Nick Stahl as John Connor, Claire Danes as Kate Brewster they originally wanted Sophia Bush for the role talk about lose lose & Kristanna Loken as The TX. Story is Judgment Day didn't happen John Connor lives off the grid Sarah Connor died but given Linda Hamilton's reasons for not wanting to do it it's nobody's fault. John Connor is homeless. 1st things 1st Nick Stahl is a terrible actor he belongs in some kind of chick flick. He gets hurt riding a motorcycle he breaks into a Veterinaran Office to get some pain killers your intorduced to Kate Brewster who works as a Veterinaran she finds out that someone broke into the office she tells John that the medicane he took is used to neuter Dogs ha ha ha this movies lame attempt at humor is annoying. Your introduced to the bad Terminator The TX guess what she has the ability to do expand her b  o  o  b  s & turn her arm into various  weapons like a plasma cannon circular saw & a flamethrower. Yep what we have is a cliche summer blockbuster movie now that's not a bad thing it just didn't work for a Terminator movie. The TX kills this lady takes her convertible & you know what song should've been playing when she was going around killing people that would be John's officer's in the future Barbie Girl cause Kristanna Loken is good looking in all but she isn't a good actor. Seriously this is the best you could get to play a villain Terminator when you could've got Jean Cluade Van Damme, The Rock, Vin Diesel or Wesley Snipes. If you had to go only for women you know you couuld've gotten Cynthia Rothrock, Kate Beckinsale or Bridgette Wilson. Then The Terminator comes into the picture they try to recreate the humor of The Bar Scene in Terminator 2 when The Terminator goes to a strip bar takes a stripper's clothes & when he goes outside he puts on these Elton John sunglasses like he wore in the 70's or 80's. The TX goes to The Vet Clinic & you know how how she finds out John Connor is there by tasting  his blood. Ther Terminator shows up & pwns supposed more advanced Terminator John & Kate get out of there. The TX shoots The Terminator with a plasma blast which he eventually gets up from that I mean The T 1,000 did more damage to The Terminator in T2. You have a decent chase scene pluse some cool stunt work with the crane. The TX kills Kate Brewster's Fiancee. The Terminator tellsJohn & Kate they're married in the future as well that he is The Terminator that killed him in 2032. WOW way to spoil stuff plus this BS about John & Kate being married never did they tell us that John Connor was married in the future. John & Kate talk about this party when they were in the the 8th grade you know stuff I didn't care about. You have The Terminator go into this gas station he tells he tells the clerck to talk to the hand if that was meant to be funny it was fail. There was a wtf scene where The Terminator grabs John Connor's head was he trying to grøú  pè him. Then they go to this Funeral Home where they  find a casket & it has a bunch of weapons in it. The Terminator guns down bunch of cop cars it's an ok action scene. Basically they have to get to CRS they took over from Cyberdine after it was trashed in T2. The Terminator tells John & Kate Judgment Day can't be stopped. I was thinking well T2 didn't mean much. BTW at the beginning John isn't sure Judgment Day was prevented so why didn't Sarah start preparing John just in case you know. Or he getsx himself prepared by joining The Army or The Marines. Oh & thanks that pretty much spoiled the ending in a way. The TX kills Kate's Brewster's Father who is a General in The Air Force. Before he dies he tells John & Kate to go to Crystal Peak to use the centeral computer. You have a few ok action scenes where the machines start attacking. Claire Danes isn't believeable when she's trying to be like Sarah Connor. Basically there trying to get out of there John's a push over & a wimp. There is an ok fight scene with The Terminator & TX. Here is the scene I call BS on when The TX kicks The Terminator's head why doesn't she just finish the job. I mean The T 1,000 messed up The Terminator bad. The TX kicks The Terminator in the head & the head is still hanging on by wires & she just reprograms him to kill John Connor. They manage to not even do that right with the help of John The Terminator fights it off. John & Kate go off to Crystal Peak The TX follows them. You get to the finish The Terminator comes in crashes a helicopter into The TX she isn't finished she has been burnt down to an Endoskelton it's not more advanced than The T 1,000. Cause The T 1,000 was made of entirely liquid metal. The only thing different is that The TX has an Endoskelton & can turn her hand into different weapons. The Terminator kills The TX by shoving a power cell into her mouth not much of an ending fight. John & Kate find out there is no centeral computer. Judgment Day couldn't be stopped like what was said in the middle of the movie. However the scene where Judgment Day happens has a wonderful piece of music by Marco Beltrami called Radio. Final thoughts is the movie shouledn't have been made unless they went for the future war  humans vs the machines. I thought the humor was all fail. They canceled out T2 by basically making Judgment Day happen. It was a cliche summer movie that's not a bad thing just that it didn't work for a Terminator movie. So was Terminator Salvation a cliche summer blockbuster but I didn't have the expectations for Terminator Salvation that I did for T3. In fact Robocop 3 is better than this movie cause Robocop 3 didn't have a 12 year wait that Terminator 3 had. I have heard some of the ideas for Termminator 5 & from what I have heard I am not looking forward to it. Maybe 1 day I'll review all 4 Terminator movies  Acting that wasn't any good with a John Connor that was annoying & a push over I know that in T2 & The Sarah Connor Chronicles that John wasn't ready either but this is an older John Connor. A girl that was thrown in there & I didn't believe at all. I didn't really care for any of the characters especially for John when they guy they put in that position is a terrible actor  along with a Terminator that isn't not all that advanced. Especiallly when you see how much it took to destroy The Terminator in the 1st & The T 1,000 in the  2nd movie. I can see why Jonathon Mostow didn't direct a movie for 6 years & even then he hasn't directed anything since 09. Arnold Schwarzenegger looked like he didn't want to be there. It felt like he was just campaigning for Governor Of California. Nick Stahl was horrible. Clarie Danes was s*  *  t I mean the only movie she was any good in was Brokedown Palace. But Kristanna Loken takes the cake for being the worst actress. Basically it's a sequel I could've done without.

B005HSG3U6|4.0|While I was very hesitant to buy this case when I was reading some of the views I went ahead and bought it anyways. A lot of people are complaining about discoloration. With any white case you are risking a chance of disocloration. Maybe if that is what you are worried about you should pick one of their other color options. This case stands up very well and it protects my Kindle Fire. My only complaint is that the inside of the front cover is a fabric that attracts hair.. in my case dog hair... But honestly this one tiny thing does not affect how much I love this case.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book seems so real compared to 50 shades of grey. You defiantly want to read this book and the whole series

0375842209|5.0|How can a novel narrated by Death and set in Nazi Germany be uplifting?<br /><br />It's a question I've been pondering since I finished THE BOOK THIEF several days ago, and while I can point to Death's macabre humor and unique sensory experience of the world, I can name the feisty adolescents and silly swearing housewives, I think what most strikes me is the care given to souls through this unusual narrator, whether or not those souls are worthy.<br /><br />Human worth is explored in great depth in this novel, and the protagonist, a young German girl named Liesel, her foster parents, the Jewish man they hide, and Liesel's best friend, Rudy, are all terribly human and dazzlingly worthy. Zusak has created an intricately connected world of characters real enough to step out of the pages of the book. This is a novel of courage, pain, sin, and redemption, and as my friend who recommended THE BOOK THIEF said to me, \\"You will never see the world quite the same once you've read it.\\"<br /><br />I must agree with this statement, and I highly recommend THE BOOK THIEF to anyone interested in fiction that transcends style and genre to create a story that touches the core of what it means to be human. THE BOOK THIEF is one of those novels that lingers with the reader, and makes one's heart feel larger for having read it.

B00BW0QC8G|4.0|I will cut to the chase and briefly summarize right off the bat - I have a Targus Legend IQ backpack-style laptop bag that I prefer to this bag. This is not a bad bag at all and I think it suits the need nicely, but I think there are equivalent bags available for less money.<br /><br />The most important feature of any laptop bag, whether it's a backpack-style bag or an attache case bag, is protection for the laptop it carries. This particular bag does provide reasonable padding, though this padding is a little thin on the bottom which is an area where I think most of the padding is actually needed. I would be very wary of dropping this bag from all but the shortest distances from the ground as there just isn't the kind of cushion needed. This is, in my eyes, the biggest flaw in this bag, though to be fair most backpack-style bags have less padding on the bottom than required so I can't really single this out as making this bag any worse off than any other I have used.<br /><br />Pockets - storage compartments are important when transporting computer equipment and this bag has a lot of them. Including the divider in the main compartment there are no less than nine compartments in this bag, each of varying utility. I especially appreciate the small zippered compartments on the sides of the bag which are perfect for small flashlights and USB sticks. The main compartment is suitable for a laptop and a tablet or even two smaller laptops. The front zippered compartment, though spacious, gets a little cramped when storing a power cord and a trackball together.<br /><br />This is a well-constructed bag that appears to be very sturdy and rugged. One weak spot I have seen in several other bags of this type is the top handle strap that has a bad tendency to rip loose. I do not think this is going to be a problem for this bag - the stitching is high quality and the tight-weave nylon should make this bag's handle hold for a long time.<br /><br />So, what is my main complaint with this bag? It's the price. As I write this, this bag sells for ~$90 full-price. My Targus bag which is roughly equivalent in quality and utility sells for about half that price. When I can get the same usefulness from a product that costs so much less, I have trouble justifying the expense.<br /><br />The bag itself is a good bag and I think it will serve well for anyone looking for a good, rugged and spacious laptop bag. The price, however, gives me pause when there are less expensive options readily available.th this bag? It's the price. As I write this, this bag sells for ~$90 full-price.

B00CMYRVAO|5.0|JOE, has out done himself. Since receiving an early copy last Thursday, that's all I've been listening to. Upon it's official release 7/2/13, I made my way to Target first thing in the morning when the opened and purchased three (3)three copies... that's right, 3 copies!!! I need one for my car (even though I burned to my car CD system), one for home and one for work. And since I'm feeling generous, I got an extra copy for my friend.  If you are on the fence about this album, take a leap of faith and jump over. THIS ALBUM IS EXCELLENT from start to finish! Joe, if by some strange reason your curious about how your fans are receiving Doubleback Evolution of R&B and decide to read your reviews; let me tell you that it's incredible. Signature was and is still dope, but this right here is off the charts. You are R&B. Ten stars from me.<br /><br />Your Heavenly Father has truly blessed you with the gift of music. May He continue to richly bless your talent and may the great music keep coming until the end of time.<br /><br />A JOE FAN FOR LIFE!!!
B00DIMXTBO|5.0|Love, the first and second books. After finishing the first book I immediately bought the second book with no hesitation. I am a bargain hunter and believe me I seek  bargained priced books. However to the pleasure of reading this wonderful series, I am all praise for this wonderful author. The first book was a free download from Amazon, the second was even a better read. The book I believe was intended for late teen or young adults, however it was so beautifully written that it can be read for adults as well, I love sci-fi books and books that challenges your perception of what reality is all about and that kept me glued to my kindle fire to finish both amazing books.<br />It has everything, lots of action, suspense, and most of all how the hero goes to all stages of life. Emotions such as love,hate,rage,betrayals all part of becoming adult, the responsibilities,the tragedies,the friendships,the society as a whole. I cannot wait for the third book, to see how Nate will take on the challenges,trials and overcome the insurmountable obstacles that faces his path becoming the leader the movement needs. Enough said read the first book and decide if it does not make you read the second  book and try to find out what happens to beloved characters of this amazing series.

B00AZL3PBK|3.0|I have noticed with this game that the main player Lep gets stuck in a weird dying cycle. If you are playing and he dies the game will start you back at the halfwAy point if you made it that far. On some levels however as soon as the game starts lep falls to his doom. I am trying to begin level 3 but I can't because the game placed him to far off to one side and as soon as it starts Lep falls and dies and there is nothing to be done about it. The game is extremely addicting though. It is like Mario in the way the game plays but more fun because you get to throw things at the enemies.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse is everything you could ask for in a $80 mouse for half the price.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+For the most part, comfortable<br />+Bundled software easy to use<br />+Profile button switch (can be disabled)<br />+Mouse wheel (Mouse 3 'button') isn't a pain in the butt to click<br />+The rubbery material for the thumb rest is awesome! I almost wish it was on the other side (pinky-side) of the mouse as well.<br />+I was able to fine-tune my mouse to emulate the mouse I used for more than 10 years, but now with 5000 dpi!<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The 3 side buttons seem kind of cumbersome, but that may be because I have large hands. Only the large raised one is really any bit of comfortable to use<br />-The macro recording software left some room for desire, but otherwise it did alright. I simply made an advanced macro in a 3rd party package and then bound the key pattern to the button on my mouse.<br />-Extremely minor, superficial thing: The color toggle only changes the Anker logo color, but leaves the profile and mouse wheel blue. Regardless, still a good looking mouse.

0465011047|5.0|This is a great book, a clean, linear narrative, written simply but effectively, with solid emotional and intellectual content.<br /><br />The book's key takeaway for me is the global community should be focused on regime change in North Korea.  The Kim dynasty is truly cancerous, having systematically stripped the populace of all fundamental rights - free speech, and expression; freedom of movement, freedom of association.  Individual live under a daily threat of being whisked away to a concentration camp for a signel negative comment about the political leadership.  The country has been silenced through institutionalized fear, intimidation and a collapsed economic system that is collective in name but is grounded in fact in bribery and a highly capitalist black market.<br /><br />What's barely mentioned in this book is North Korea's militarization and nuclear capability.  That's good because that may be the problem from the outside looking in, but Chol-Hwan's account is from the inside looking out, and from that perspective the problem is a leadership that has enslaved the populace.<br /><br />Kang Chol-Hwan showed admirable perseverance surviving the Yodok Gulag, and great courage risking his life escaping to China and ultimately South Korea. This compelling book is an important story of individual accomplishment and, so very importantly, a testament to the sad plight of an enslaved populace who need the support of a global community.  This book illustrates that the North Korean people have no means to overthrow its leadership.  Change must come from the outside.<br /><br />A must read!

B00BN1QV1M|5.0|Santa Fe Listener, the first reviewer of this set, has got it absolutely right -- this is a splendid box in very good analogue sound, and while one might quibble at the margins, it contains sterling performances of a lot of different stuff.  To take Abbado's measure, just try the Mendelssohn disc and the Prokofiev disc.  It's hard to imagine more different sound worlds than those of these two composers, and yet clearly Abbado is alive to both.  Prokofiev's Third Symphony  (which I didn't know) receives a gripping performance -- all the sound and clatter, with an undertone of Russian melancholy (it was 1939) which is as un-Tchaikovskian as you can get.  And the high spirits of his First Symphony, the \\"Classical,\\" which has fun with the very idea of \\"Classical,\\" is well-worth comparing to Mendelssohn's very different appropriation of classical manners in his Third and Fourth symphonies.  Abbado recorded the Mendelssohn again later, for DG, and these later performances are very good, but I actually prefer the sound in the earlier ones -- Decca's 1960's analogue sound was something special in the Culshaw era.  Other items worth hearing are a Bruckner First and some Janacek and Hindemith -- adventurous programming in the '60's, and very well done.  The Beethoven is OK -- Eighth better than the Seventh, which lacks the first-movement repeat -- and the Verdi disc with Ghiaurov in extended scenes from some operas is good to have too.  To my ears, the \\"Nabucco\\" scenes don't come off as well as they should -- it's as if the chorus, the orchestra, and the singer aren't quite in the same \\"space,\\"  with the chorus not sufficiently foregrounded and Ghiaurov  sounding firm but not warm.  A pity, because the playing is good.  The \\"Macbeth\\" and \\"Boccanegra\\" scenes sound much better balanced, and Ghiaurov sounds marvelous.  A final impression -- after the voices stop in the \\"Boccanegra\\" scene, there's an orchestral passage that Abbado has the orchestra play with such beauty and with such aptness to the dramatic situation that it's almost worth the price of the box.  I recommend this box -- excellent value for money, and a fine tribute to a great conductor.such aptness to the dramatic situation that it's almost worth the price of the box.

B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This was a cute movie that I figured I would have to watch before I went to see the second. The best part of watching the movie was to listen to my boyfriend laugh hysterically!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this app because I never have trouble opening it and it's just fun. It lets you take pictures of the house and that's a cool feature.
B004AFFZNI|5.0|Great way to lighten the gopro and get better audio (not 100% sealed like the standard case)<br /><br />I use it with my Quadcopter to save weight and let me connect my FPV gear to it. Works great.<br /><br />Obviously it is NOT waterproof- so that could be an issue for some.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved the romance about this book. Their love for each other was so unique. So amazing. I want more. It shows how teenagers can have an amazing love for each other. To show either when sick or healthy you are still able to love and care for each other. I really hope they make a movie for this book. I hate how Augustus died though. But that's what makes it a book. The disappointments and the good things are what makes the book so fantastic and makes you want to read more. This is my favorite book now. It was the greatest book I have ever read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|ok so all these people are saying &quot; it doesnt work on my kimdle fire&quot; or &quot;  im stuck&quot; well suck it up because its not like there going to help you so just stop its really stupid.I do recomend this to whoevers reading this. oh and HATERS GONNA HATE!
B004478AS4|2.0|This is not captivating, I have not finish it yet. Does not hold my attention.This book is very boring, slow.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|While no one who hasn't personally experienced the horrors of life in North Korea can honestly attest to how it really is -- as Adam Johnson readily admits -- the reader walks away from &#34;The Orphan Master's Son&#34; with the impression that the author nailed it. The story chronicles the bizarre and horrid life of Jun Do, who suffers one life trauma after another, guilty only of the crime of being born in North Korea. Johnson brings to life the dehumanizing effects of North Korea's autocracy, where everything is a lie and life depends on your complicity with the falsehoods. While the depravity described is shocking at times, we're consoled by the triumph of the human spirit. Jun Do grew up unloved in an orphanage, surrounded by death and despair. He was trained to fight in the pitch black darkness of the tunnels the North Koreans burrowed into South Korea, and he was forced to use those skills to murder and kidnap. Yet, through it all, he maintains basic human decency, shows kindness at every turn and puts others before himself. Jun Do's unexplained imprisonment in a labor camp leads to a whacky turn of events, so strange, so bizarre that the plot line would never work in another novel. But in a context where everything is a lie, Jun Do's later life as Commander Ga makes perfect sense. If you have an interest in North Korea with all of its fascinating story lines, this is a must-read, but I'd also recommend it to anyone who enjoys a great read. There's a reason it won the Pulitzer Prize.
B00ABLJ5NQ|3.0|Like so many others, I'd been waiting for something a bit more substantial than the recent young adult fare that Gaiman has been writing and was eager to pick this one up, pre-purchased months in advance. Little did I know that I would, indeed, be getting another young adult fantasy novelette.<br /><br />The characters are poorly fleshed out for the novel I was expecting, again, like others, bigger, deeper, juicier, character origins and motivations not described, references to darkness behind reality, semi-immortal wise women and monsters that are denizens but without any particular purpose. It all seems a bit...done before. You can pick up almost any speculative fiction book these days and you'll get something like this. Briarpatch by Tim Pratt. The biggest echo as far as writing weight and quality was with the Thief of Always, a Clive Barker young adult book.<br /><br />Taken as a young adult or youth novel, it's fine. Taken as an adult-targeted novel, I suspect it will leave you unimpressed.
1556347308|5.0|A must buy with the GURPS Basic Set: Characters: It was easy to understand and helped me with my GMing a lot. Overall just like with the characters book, this book was well worth its value in money.
B005SEKMH4|5.0|This book is a great way to change the way you think naturally. you don't need drugs, just exercise, you'll loose weight, be more relax and enhance your capacity to learn. I read this book in one day.  I needed natural ideas to improve my teens' memory, focus and attitude.  Exercising on a daily basis helps to work on all of these issues.  This summer our task is to develop an exercise routine, this will continue when school reopens.  I will recommend this to adults and students, studying or stressed out.  I know and vouched to the benefits of exercising I just never saw how exercise improved the brains functionality Spark points out how studies exist to proves the effect of exercise on the brain.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I wasn't expecting to truly like this. It is hard to live up to the original Wizard of Oz but this takes such a different direction that you aren't left comparing it to the original at all.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Planned to read only up to the point  where Season 3 ended on HBO but could not stop until I finished the entire book
B004XUMMFE|4.0|This series was intelligent science fiction.  I didn't watch it when it was on the regular schedule, but noted Sheldon's favorable comment on Big Bang Theory, so decided to give it a shot.
B0068THAGY|5.0|This show *PROPELLED* me back to my 1970's childhood.  Abrams and Spielberg's retentive commitment to detail nearly brought tears to my eyes; the RELEVANCE of every element, the nuance, wow... just WOW.  Its SciFi element dragged me into the theater to watch this film, everything else kept me riveted and hoping it would run hours longer than its 112 minutes.<br />This was a major sleeper flim:  I only went to see it because I was out of town and couldn't sleep... I walked out of the theater just blown away.  The last time that happened was in the 1980's: After bailing out of a movie we paid to see (Working Girl; it was terrible!) and ducking into another theater to see a then little known flick named Die Hard...<br /><br />I highly recommend this flick..on a LARGE screen, with a great sound system...especially appropriate to those having grown up in the 70's... in Middle America...<br /><br />Cheers.
159668139X|5.0|I'm brand new to weaving and acquired a (free) floor loom. Well, not entirely free, I had to buy some parts to get it working, then some equipment, then some books, etc...<br /><br />A local teacher, when we determined her class schedule didn't fit with my schedule, recommended this book, as it is the one she uses as a text in her classes. It is indeed very informative and clearly written for the beginner, with some bits of humor added in.
0060935464|4.0|It was for my son to read for school. We've never read it before so it was a hard read for both my son and I. But all in all it was in decent condition and all the pages were there. It came in great time. Thank you!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game<br />Its the way your always playing it and its amazing!<br />I love playing it when I have nothing to do and to just relax most of the time
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Jumped around and had many characters to keep up with. Tied it all up in the end but not as good as the other two Afghanistan books. Tragic story but rewarding outcome.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great challenges for the whole family. My 5 and 6 year old loved this as much as I did. We want more!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this game is very fun and occupying.<br />I love it a lot . u should get this game.<br />it is worth it
B00BW5K5DO|3.0|Greater game but needs better instructions &amp; bugs you for review &amp; to purchase full game. Those. Who do not want or can not afford  or who hate writing reviews -- do not bother...
B00DGN51O8|3.0|I didn't manage to see this in the theatre where I think it would be more fun. 3D viewing would likely increase the entertainment value. The movie is definitely a popcorn flick, and enjoyable if you don't mind the middle school humor (nose picking, etc.). It kind of reminded me of a violent Shrek with no donkey and/or Puss-n-Boots to add levity and true humor. I can easily imagine if this had come out when my son was between 9-11, he would have watched it over and over for weeks. So, don't go into it with the idea that it will be for small children or adults, because its really for the *non-sheltered* pre-teen set. I didn't want to turn it off and run away, but not was I riveted.
B008M721MS|5.0|loads quickly and always works well. never interferes with any other functions I use the Kindle Fire for on a daily basis.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|These are the exact manufacturer replacement eartip for the product.  They work perfectly, fit comfortably in your ears.  Definitely recommend these.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved every part of this book! Only thing I didn't like is the fact that it has ended! I'm waiting to see it on the big screen! Hope they choose a great Christian and Ana!<br /><br />EVERY MARRIED COUPLE SHOULD READ THIS...
B0089LOG02|5.0|About half way in and it is really good!  Very well written.  Will post again when I am done with it.
B001G8XON0|5.0|I love this movie. I sing along to EVERY song. It's so fun and I am stoked they made it on blu ray finally!
B000001FK3|5.0|Treat yourself and get this if you like any of the more famous versions of these tunes. JJ is a great songwriter, soulful singer and guitarist.  The CD sounds low tech , but its very refreshing to hear.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I enjoy reading Historical Fiction, and this book was very informative. My ancestors came from Ireland, just like Vivian's.  They didn't ride the Orphan Train, but this story still seemed to speak to me. Thank you for writing this novel!
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I cant quit doodling. Have told all my kindle friends about it. Let your imagination run wild as you create your own Color combinations . Save your works of art or share them with friends,  or erase your mistakes.  Recommend if you have extra time or look out you might be making extra time!
B009LDXQGC|5.0|Who doesn't love three doors down!? How could you not?? Greatest hits is the tits! Bought as a stocking stuffer for my fiancé along with a bunch of other 90s alternative CDs!
B00000JNJ1|5.0|These guys were as good as the Stones at one point, then one of them joined the Stones!!<br /><br />A great intro to Faces, and also to the great Ronnie Lane.  Standout tracks for me are OOh La La, Debris, and Stay with Me.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|The author has done a fabulous job laying out expansive research in a clear and relatable manner. I am an ambivert myself and it was great to better understand both sides of my personality. My husband is an introvert as is my five year old daughter and the insights on relating and teaching introverts was incredible. I will be a better wife and mother having read this!<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this show!!  In fact, Hannibal has ruined all other tv shows for me.  I can't wait for it to come back next year.  It has hardly been a month since the season finale and I am already going through heavy withdrawals!!!
B005OP2928|5.0|I saw this after 4 days of family Disneyland...12 in all ages 16 months-62 years, and a combo of multi-age brothers and sisters nieces, nephews, cousins, grandparents, adult and young children, uncles and aunts.....it hit every chord...my husband and were doubled over laughing after our Disney days ended.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I have been playing a little and having fun.  Seems like it doesn't always go in the direction I swipe.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The only problem is once you get the hang of how to solve things its over. challenging but not enough to throw my kindle
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I'm not even joking. That's quite a feat for an author! The Daily Practice is interesting, quirky and perfect for the modern wage slave with higher ambitions or the entrepreneur. Altucher is quickly becoming a dependable voice for either.
B005K15XR4|5.0|I wasn't even aware of the &#34;epic/trailer&#34; music genre until I heard some samples from this CD and I was immediately hooked. There's a lot of wonderful melodies and intricate vocal bits crammed into 2-3 minute pieces and these guys really deliver the goods. I will undoubtedly purchase more of their work in the future.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this is a cute game, but I have to admit it gets kinda boring after a while....same old same old
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This is a wonderful movie for all ages, and I love it's clever interpretation of established mythical figures. I mean who doesn't love a Russian Santa Claus?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so fun and it is so enteresting game u don't want to quit the game so fun. I love this game and. It is. So like adicting u need to get this game
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|Not a bad plot, acting was ok but the audio was bad.  Russell Crowe mumbled half his lines so I had to turn the volume up to hear him, then of course the next scene would start with some obnoxiously loud noise like sirens and I couldn't turn the volume down fast enough.  I don't understand why in this modern day the film industry won't do volume leveling so as not to totally frustrate their audience.  Louder isn't better, and straining to hear an actor mumble is ridiculous since in a theater I can't rewind and turn up the volume to understand what was said.  3 stars for average plot and bad sound editing.  Mind you, this had nothing to do with the quality of the sound delivered by Amazon, this was a problem with the actual sound editing when the film was made.  Just want to be clear on that.
B00AEUU4LQ|3.0|Not particularly spell biinding. Story jumped around and characters hard to keep track of ot one of his best novels. Depressing at times--would not recommend as summer reading.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is an awesome game. I also like the new features on it. It's way better than the original temple run.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is awesome and very addicting. It should only be played when you don't have anything else to do. I highly recommend this game!!!!!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Very entertaining, funny, great story line and a world of SuperHero's we normally<br />never see in any storyline like the &#34;Black Widow&#34; and &#34;Hawk-Eye&#34;
B0083DJWGO|4.0|Great thought, proven out many ways with many examples.<br />Only objection is it's the same idea driven home over and over...
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Good adult story.  Certainly earned its &#34;R&#34; rating.  Not one I was comfortable allowing even the 15 & 16-year olds watch.  Story line is compelling and the cinematography is really good.  There are some great lessons to be learned from this story;  but I strongly recommend it for mature Adults only.
B000I9U9A4|5.0|Patrick O'Brian's genius captured in this fitting tribute by Peter Weir. Had they been  paintings, six or seven of the scenes in this film would be hung as masterpieces.<br />From the first frame to the last, suspension of disbelief is complete; you're \\"transported\\" to another place and time by a benign press gang.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|I honestly could not see why there was such a big hype about this movie. Once you meet and learn a bit more about each of the characters and slowly begin to understand about their past. It was quite frankly just sad, kind of dull really. Not to mention both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence characters were just so horribly written. Pretty much the whole time I was watching the movie, kept thinking was gonna turn around and it didn't. Was very anti-climatic.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is  a great game that makes you pay attention to the surroundings. Once I started I could not put  it away.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|i am not a cartoon fan, but this one was fun and clever.  I recommend to my friends and I am getting ready for the sequel.
B00004U2G1|5.0|I had hoped for a 5.1 channel mix on this album because it cries out for it but in keeping with the original format this is excellent.<br />Its so clear, you can hear nuances you couldn't hear when it came out on vinyl, even though the vinyl was as about as clean a recording for the time as you could get. This remastering gave this disc the punch of solid clean bass and mid-range and topped it off with crystal clear high end, all together this disc is reborn and absolutely exciting to listen to. If you have even a half way decent sound system, your going to love listening to this disc. It will give you the first time experience you got when you listened to it upon its original release. Worth every penny!!! Its MORE THAN A FEELING!
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|I have another live album called Good Timin live Kneborth but this CD puts the other one to shame cuz this one has 2 CDs i like that Because i go on long car rides or shorts ones i sit in the car while my dad goes shopping or whatever I preorder this CD on May 8th 2013 and it was Delievered on May 23rd it came quick I want to look for this 2 CD set for my friend thats having a Graduation party this month but don't know which store carries it i want my friend to experince the same thing i did although she wasn't at the 50th anniversary tour last year this CD would make a great gift for any occasion I have some of the songs on my Ipod i go for walks this CD is my favorite my favorite songs are Catch A Wave Don't Back Down and the car songs and last but not least Barbara Ann<br />the sound quality is great when i listen to it in the car or when i even put it on my headphones when i take a walk
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Huge fan!!! Buy this.. No one has ever done a zombie series and &#34;broken the rules&#34; with involving children as zombies and action violence. The best show on TV... Warning... If you start this show you will not be able to stop...
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Loved Sheryl's outlook on women in the workplace. As a 20-something working in NYC, there were many points she made in the book that made me truly think about my demeanor at work and re-evaluate where I'm headed professionally. I'd highly recommend it.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|Blu Ray would not play in my laptop, which I have never had issues with. Watched the standard DVD which does not include the additional footage.
B008J34466|5.0|My first Pink CD and love it!! Every song is great and most songs will pump you up. Get the unedited version for the best results.<br />Pink is HOT HOT HOT!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very user friendly. Images were clear and colorful. Directions were easy to understand. Would definitely tell my friends about this game.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Must see! Entertaining and informative, this show provides a historical look about England's class consciousness and how it affected their daily living.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|July 2013 update now requires real money for user to become or remain competitive.  Too bad as I really enjoyed this game - will now delete.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I really enjoyed this one. It is a new twist on making magic from a practical perspective - through study rather than inate and it has great adventure and human folly mixed in. I immediately ordered the next book.
B006K1IIAC|5.0|I got this for my girlfriend cause she really loves the actors and the show. When we got the package she was really excited and happy about recieving this. So yes, it's an amazing product.
B001DJLD1M|3.0|This set of The Matrix movies contained all three films plus \\"Animatrix\\" as advertised.  It contains four discs, not the two double-sided discs from the product description or the ten discs mentioned in some customer reviews.  The discs for The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions are labeled \\"Disc One\\" as if there were another accompanying disc but they are not to be found.  Also there are no special features for The Matrix Revolutions or for The Matrix Reloaded. The Animatrix makes up for that omission somewhat.  It is still a bargain but it seems unfair to separate the films from their special features on the missing discs.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|it's Led Zeppelin with Bonzo's little boy! the greatest rock and roll band of all time with the son of the the best drummer to ever live! if you like led zeppelin and you don't buy this,you are only cheating yourself!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I am hanging on the life story of Kvothe the arcanist and will be sorely disappointed when the book is over and I can't hear more of his life until the next one comes out!! The author has skill fully raised this very human but very talented arcanist from a bumbling teen to more and more maturity through fabulous adventures and learning.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lots of options with these games and a lot of fun. love that I can enjoy the games and so can my 5 year old.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|this app is very helpful. one way it helps is to let me know for how long I have charge my kindle.<br />very happy with this app.<br />very good.
8866137634|5.0|My job requires attendance at a lot of meetings.  Despite the usefulness of a smartphone it's still strange to see someone typing away at a phone during a meeting, and most people assume I'm texting or something similarly rude.  With this notebook I can both take notes and then have a digital record of the meeting without having to keep the notebook close at hand all the time.  Nice quality and the 3-month Evernote Premium membership offsets the already-discounted cost as well.  Highly recommended for people who need to take written notes in a digital world.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|These are super to keep gunk off counters!! I purchased an additional set for our vacation home after finding the first set.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Enjoyed, actors fit the characters, and look forward to another one. Only negative was the low volume which I haven't experience when streaming other shows.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|I've been a fan of Whitney since I heard her on the radio as a young child. I absolutely loved the collection of her best songs on this CD. I have found myself playing it over and over again while often times singing at the top of my lungs. Whitney Houston is definitely missed.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I really liked this book. It was filled with action. Rick Riordan books are so much fun to read. I cannot wait to read the next book in the series.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I agree that the game has just the right amount of challenge but doesn't make it so difficult that you want to quit. Eagerly waiting for more levels!
B000HEWEE4|5.0|Though the ending could have been more dramatic or bigger, the story was outstanding and really pulled at the heart strings of the audience.  I would recommend to anyone interested in purchasing.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|Vampire Weekend is a New York Rock/Indie outfit and members are as follows Ezra Koeng, Rostam Batmanglij, Chris Tomson, and Chris Baio. Having found this group from the Needle Drop i went and listened to their and first and second album. My favorite album out of those two is Contra their second album. Then i went and listened to their third album Modern Vampires Of The City i was blown away. In my honest opinion i though that this album was better than Contra. Each song has its own unique city feel, the songs on this album can be fun,sad,dramatic and colorful. Each song has this certain foggy and free environment about it and VW makes me fell like i am watching them live in the city.  Each song has also this experimental feeling to, VW don't just stick to one genre they explore the city of New York.  Fav Tracks:  Obvious Bicycle Step Diane Young Don't Lie Ya Hey  What are you waiting for go get you copy now.
B00B97SNJI|5.0|No wonder they open for Jackson Browne.  The first cut on this album could have come off one of his softer early albums.  Very tuneful and original songwriting.  I'll buy this band again.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Excelent, recommend this product. Special features in spanish is good for latin consumers, thanks for included spanish in this pack.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like it because it is hard I can't wait for the rest of the levels because I am on level eleven
B0042X9L6A|5.0|This flash is just what I was looking for. I was having issues with my built in flash with my longer lenses. This one shows right over them. :-)
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|My step daughter had me watch it with her. I laughed so hard, and I REALLY enjoyed all the sining.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|The story keeps you riveted, we watched it twice. Action and an engaging story, we couldn't ask for more from a movie.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|This is an excellent film and it was not at all what I expected.  The outcome was worth watching the film.
B000641ZA4|5.0|Amazing recopilation of videoclips of this great band, good quality in every aspect, more than 30 videos!.<br />Buy it you won't regret it!!<br /><br />Tracklist:<br />1  No Son Of Mine<br />2  I Can't Dance<br />3  Hold On My Heart<br />4  Jesus He Knows Me<br />5  Tell Me Why<br />6  Invisible Touch<br />7  Throwing It All Away<br />8  Land Of Confusion<br />9  Tonight, Tonight, Tonight (New Edit)<br />10  Anything She Does<br />11  In Too Deep<br />12  That's All<br />13  Mama (Edit)<br />14  Illegal Alien<br />15  Home By The Sea / Second Home By The Sea<br />16  Paperlate<br />17  Abacab (Edit)<br />18  Keep It Dark<br />19  No Reply At All (Edit)<br />20  Man On The Corner<br />21  Turn It On Again<br />22  Duchess<br />23  Misunderstanding<br />24  Follow You, Follow Me<br />25  Many Too Many<br />26  A Trick Of The Tail<br />27  Ripples<br />28  Robbery, Assault, And Battery<br />29  Congo<br />30  Shipwrecked<br />31  Not About Us<br />32  The Carpet Crawlers 1999
B008602KQI|5.0|It's a good movie, different  from  other story lines. It Inspired me to read the books, which by the way were all fabulous reads. I'm definitely looking forward to the release of the second  movie.
B00CS65JS2|3.0|I've been a fan of Daft Punk for a long time, and sadly this has to be one of their worst and slow tempo albums i've had/heard.  Daft Punk Alive 2007 was their last best one for me...well, besides the Tron soundtrack.
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|Do not buy the HD version. The quality was horrible.  And I know they say \\" picture quality depends on my Internet connection\\". Well of that's the case I can can wait while it loads a bit longer so that I can enjoy the nice picture quality.
B00845MRKE|5.0|I think this my fifth purchase of a Blade Runner release. Every one of them has offered something new over the previous releases, not always something major, but something that makes adding to the Blade Runner collection appealing. The films are the films, and are presented with amazing quality on Blu-ray. The collectibles are the draw for me at this point. As collectibles go, these are among the nicer offered by such Collector's Editions. Having a second spinner (the first from the Briefcase Edition) is a nice touch, and the additional artwork is revelatory. For fans of the film, including those who already have previous editions, this 30th Anniversary Edition is a worthy addition to your collection, especially at its currently reduced price. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00C7JGDBW|1.0|This film was very poorly made. Very rushed and very long and tedious. I wish I wouldn't have spent on this.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Considering this was the writer's first book (I think), it's got a great concept. I thought the tone of the writing could have been better, but the concept and the twist made up for it. No wonder it's a classic.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|I was born 29 days after Michael Jackson released Bad - an album I associate with dancing around the house as a little boy. We still have that worn down CD somewhere around here. Since I personally haven't bought the album since, this was the perfect box set to pick up. It's an absolute treasure, and I'm not saying that just because of how incredible the box and the contents are. Bad may not be as \\"epic\\" as Thriller, it never made it quite as big, but I think it's an even sharper and more well produced album from an artist at the very top of his game. Michael had a vision for this album, and he wrote almost every single song himself. The most powerful rock-pop songs, the most beautiful ballads and some of the most catchy beats in all of pop music can all be found in these 48 minutes. For me it's a rush of nostalgia but to this very day it still makes me tap my foot and snap my fingers. The King of Pop was never bested, and I think he's outdone himself here. No collection is complete without Thriller either, but as a whole, I think Bad is even more enjoyable and infectious. It's not as extremely overplayed by radio stations either. The second disc is no little mishmash of so-so demos - it's a rare collection of fully produced songs that would all evolve into the Bad we know and love. And they all sound absolutely fantastic, every song is easily worthy of the album itself in my opinion! If this is what Michael didn't think met his standard of quality, what other amazing songs are sure to be located in his old archives? I shudder to think, but I'm glad we finally get to hear all these great tracks. Phenomenal. There are also three modern remixes with an electro/dubstep vibe on them. Most people may skip these, but I enjoyed them. They're far better than Fergie and company's \\"interpretations\\" on [[ASIN:B000WS4QJG Thriller 25]].<br /><br />This box set is a virtual goldmine - packaged in a sleek, soft black box with the logo emblazoned at the top, you're met with a refurbished silver sticker when you open it up of Michael rocking his tough guy jacket. Two very thick and stylish booklets can be found underneath - one for the album itself, with fantastic photos and information on all the \\"demo\\" tracks. The photos bring back the time period and give the songs their very own identity and feeling, and the cover has a photograph of Michael's face under a black veil (supposedly based on a famous art photo). The second booklet is shinier, but no less packed - it chronicles the entire Bad touring era, with dozens of great photographs and every single tour date and location covered within. Then the album and live concert from Wembley 1988 come packaged in two solid cardboard packages (with two discs in each). The seminal album Bad, a full album of \\"demo\\" tracks, a great DVD concert from Wembley, and the same concert on CD as well. Indispensible. Finally you get a two-sided foldout poster of Michael from the era. It isn't huge but big enough to throw up on the wall of any room and gaze at like a longing teenager.<br /><br />Could I think of things I would've improved on in this box set? Sure. The cardboard packaging could've been real digipaks, the concert from Wembley isn't exactly HD quality (it has however been remastered about as much as possible), and the fantastic Bad25 documentary from Spike Lee is not included. But none of that matters much when what you get is such an entertaining package. The music still rocks and will live on long after we've gone. If you haven't heard Bad, now is the time. If you know you like the album, it's hard to imagine a much better version of it. The King is gone. Long live The King.bished silver sticker when you open it up of Michael rocking his tough guy jacket.

B009AVCAJ4|4.0|One of my favorite anime titles. It pulls no punches. Its shock value may be too much for some viewers. Definitely NOT for kids. I'm surprised there hasn't been an attempt at a live-action interpretation of this yet. It has all of the elements of a major Hollywood blockbuster. Then again, even with a storyboard as thorough and complete as Ninja Scroll, in the wrong hands it would be horribly botched like Avatar: The Last Airbender was.<br /><br />Ninja Scroll is great anime! RECOMMENDED
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great storyline, graphics and puzzles. I can't wait for the second one! This game is worth the money. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did.
B000FVRABG|5.0|One of the best conductors conducting one of the best orchistra playing great music composed by one of the few greatest composers.
B00COMLLX2|5.0|I love this game between Zen pinball and the pinball arcade I give Zen a slight edge but both are five star games and play great on kindle fire hd
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Even with all its problems, I loved this series. Megan Hilty and Katherine McPhee are so incredibly talented. And I loved how it gave a glimpse into understanding how a play is staged for Broadway.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a must have for fans of the movie! Enjoyable for both kids and adults. My kids are having fun just watching me play! Can't beat such a great game for FREE! Everyone should download it and play it!!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is fun.  There are a good number of levels and as you move up each level, the game becomes more challenging.  The game also has great sound effects.
0316247545|5.0|As an adult MLP collector i was very excited when i saw this book available for pre order. When it arrived i couldn't have been happier., It is beautiful to look at and the artists and writers did an amazing job on the inside.<br /><br />The book has an in depth review on every character, comments from artists and writers getting their person opinions on who they like to write/draw best or what scene was most difficult to write, a overview of every episode in seasons 1-3 and a listing of all the songs performed in the episodes.<br /><br />For adults and kids and just MLP fans, this is a beautiful addition to your collection.
B008N1V11U|5.0|It's really cool!  I can ride the bat pod and the bat. I can dodge missiles as batman. I can fly around Gotham like a boss. - per our son :)
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl is an awesome book! Get ready to go on the roller coaster ride of your life. At first I could not get into this book, but as I kept reading it, I just couldn't put it down. The author is such a brilliant lady.
1439148813|5.0|This is an inspiring insider account of America's manned-space program from the early discouraging days when rockets frequently blew up during lift-off to the glorious Apollo moon missions.  Gene Kranz covers the major events, but also mentions each unmanned and manned mission of the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs; explaining the mission objectives, what, if anything, went wrong, any on-the-spot solutions developed by the NASA team, and the results of the mission.<br /><br />It's more than a thrilling space history; it illustrates the importance of organization.  While America's manned-space program is grounded today, in Kranz's era, with much less technology, NASA put astronauts on the Moon.  Exceptional organization was the critical element as Kranz discusses the careful planning, detailed preparation, hard work, and dedication needed for success.  Frequently, unexpected problems came up during the space flight (most notably Apollo 13, but there were others) and the well-prepared NASA team was able to save an endangered mission with a quickly developed solution by thoroughly knowing what their equipment was capable of doing, over-and-above what it was designed to do.<br /><br />It's a great book.  I particularly liked Chapter 15 \\"SimSup Wins the Final Round\\" regarding how Apollo 11's Moon landing was saved by a rigorous simulation preparation.  Thanks, Director Kranz.  Mission Control is very cool.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I'm not generally a reader of post-apocalyptic stuff-too much anxiety for me!  But all in all, I really liked this book.  I liked that it represented (fictionally of course) a full range of perspectives from around the globe rather than just the American experience.  I also found it to be very thought-provoking regarding so many issues such as warfare and its impact on current and future generations, what we value as society, and what it means to win or lose. The only downside of the book for me was that because it switched between so many perspectives, you didn't build a relationship with any characters. I am curious now to see the movie to see if they create a main character for the movie audience.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Need more info on how to battle vector and use gadgets.<br />Game does not work horizontally on my iphone, though.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is not good, it`s SUPER AWESOME. It is the real minecraft and not one of those fake ripoffs. If you want the real and AWESOME minecraft, this is your game.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|I was way more drawn to the story about Sarah than the story about the woman writing the story and searching for her.  She became a bit too obsessed.  All in all, a decent read.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|When I first downloaded this game, my daughter who's 5 years old and I both absolutely LOVED this game.  The only thing that I had a complaint about was that it took so much real money to purchase some of the animals.  The graphics and games were great.  I didn't have much trouble with it getting &#34;stuck&#34; and freezing as some did.  And we loved being able to help the animals and breeding.  The animal sounds are so realistic sounding also.<br /><br />Then about two/three weeks ago an update came and I absolutely HATE IT now.  You know have to be on WIFI in order to play the game.  Before it was good for traveling and especially at home due to not having WIFI at our home.  Now we need WIFI to even play the game.  My daughter used to love playing it in the truck while traveling but now she doesn't even play it anymore.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|My daughter loves this movie, it is funny and teaches the difference between good and bad..she is 5 and her 2 year old sister love it alike...us parents get a chuckle out of it too!
B0067TQQI8|5.0|The Anker Astro2 charger I purchased has worked flawlessly.  When I am sitting out side in the evening and want to run my Kindle Fire HD I plug the charger into the port on the Kindle and play games, listen to music or watch movies for hours on end.  The longest I ran the Kindle with the charger attached was about 5 hours.  When I disconnected the charger, the Kindle was at full charge and the Anker Astro2 was about 3/4 drained.  This is also very handy if you are in the middle on nowhere and your cell phone starts dying.  I highly recommend this charger.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I bought this original sweeper when it first came out. I was always happy with it but gave it to my son for his college dorm when the new one with the hands free dirt release cup came out. It no way performed as well as the original one and after a year or so finally quit working. I recently made this purchase and am happy again with my sweeper.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|It took a while to load the video you wanted to watch. But it worked ok for me. Very slow.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|My children, both 2 and 5 enjoyed the movie very much! The colors are awesome, and being dr Seuss, the book to read after viewing always makes the kids enjoy it even more...
B0034G4OUO|5.0|The service was very prompt and exactly as promised. The movie plays very well and has been a great addition to my library. Thank you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Can't beat get all applications that go with it . Minecraft is a lot of fun for me and my family and friends.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is addicting, and I love it. But . Put it back on the kindles please. Fix it or I'll rate this a 0 cause that's messed up.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book, I felt so much alike, two people knowing each other, the truthful, sincerity and loving care is amazing,  the connection.<br />Is breathtaking I lost the time reading it. Just love it.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is fun and action packed. I would deeply recommend this awesome game for you. Get this game right now!!!!It is so awesome. I wish I could give it infinity star's.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I gave this series to my husband for Father's Day and he was absolutely thrilled. We have been watching the series on and off for days ever since he got them. I couldn't be more pleased with his reaction to his present.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|Without even seeing the film, Pacific Rim is a labor of love to a genre of cinema that has never been fully realized in the Western World. Mecha/Kaiju Films have only until now been animated, or poorly adapted in live action films, and what little exposure to anything of this caliber in the United States has been underwhelming, and poorly executed because of a general lack of substance.<br /><br />The soundtrack to the film is a bombastic blast to the genre in all of the right ways. Each track carries with it a sense of the film's style and respect for its source. For example, track 1 &#34;Pacific Rim&#34; carries the weight of a theme song if the film as a series, and track 2 &#34;Gipsy Danger&#34; resonates with the sound of the hero-mecha's main anthem. When you hear those first cords of the track, you can't help but feel the Mecha's presence.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I'm enjoying it. It's challenging on a way other games aren't, so it's useful for the summed break away from school.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Just \\"The Garden\\" alone, is worth the purchase. The<br />best song they have ever made, in my humble opinion.<br />Would love to hear a full album of songs in this style.<br />Would rival the best album's of all time.
B008MA83HC|5.0|ok
B00DGN51O8|4.0|The movie was alot better than I thought it was going to be. Alot of movies based off fairy tales tend to suck. But this one was a good movie.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book is easy to read and super funny. I love how Tina actually paves the way for other female comics.  I would definitely recommend it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Its addicting yet challenging. Its good for time when your idle rather than doing nothing. It will keep yourself busy in a heavy traffic
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|what I really liked about this movie is the way the witches looked and plus it had an great cast great movie
B009FB3W9G|4.0|As a fan of Ms. Streisand, I was not overly impressed, however, the performances from Barbra are excellent.  The performers paying tribute to her, well, perhaps they could have selected others.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The game is great. I barely got it and I am already addicted to it. It is a great game for when you a little of time.
006224454X|3.0|If it seems to good to be true, it is. This book has perfect prose and a great premise. It's the author's first book.<br /><br />Things come apart at the 100 page mark when the action bogs down in repetition. After figuring out the story's structure I realized the book should've been a hundred pages shorter. I gave up and read a spoiler.<br /><br />I have a conspiracy theory about publishers wanting books to be a certain length so they can charge a certain price. This is a mistake. Stories are like jokes, if it doesn't advance the punchline, cut it out.<br /><br />If you can tough it out til the end you'll find the book rewarding. The movie should sweep the Oscars.
B003XQM2YU|5.0|i really enjoyed this movie the cast was great and I think he played a real good Robin hood I would watch it again
B003TTMFCK|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows. Since I have children it was diffcult to keep up. So it was great that Amazon has it available.
0451196716|5.0|I have read most of Stephen King's books and this is my favorite of all of his books.  It's like a better version of the hunger games.  It reminds me of what it was like growing up as a teenage boy.  It deals with life and death, love and loss.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|thanks for all the help. They sent this to me when I told them my old one was not working.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|It use to be a truly wonderful app, but recently at some point it randomly deleted my videos and on it never lets me download Vevo videos in HD .
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game Is fun and difficult but still free I love having to find the clues and items in many mind challenging levels
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Well im not quite sure that I can rate this particular app I downloaded it to my kindle and it never successfully installed so I havent been able to use it
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|what a neat way to learn regardless of age! now I have a better understanding of something that interests me.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I got it free. I only use it for checking how much time I have left on my kindle, but it works for what I use it for.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app does everything i needed it to! Plus the factor of using my music clearly for a wake-up? Perfect
B009NOVCTM|5.0|Rolling Stones latest compilation is their best yet and it covers everything from their first singles to their latest tracks. Which also makes them one of the longest music careers of all-time. It left out a number of hits like Shattered, She's So Cold, She Said Yeah, Mother's Little Helper and Play With Fire which was a letdown but it's worth having if you can get past that. I'd recommend it for casual fans mostly, I found it for $3.00 used so it was more than worth it and great having some of my favorite songs on CD. This covers everything throughout the years of many different genres like r&b, psychedelic, baroque pop, blues, disco, new wave, punk and of course their signature rock and roll.<br /><br />Track Listing On The Standard 3-disc version:<br /><br />Disc one<br /><br />  \\"Come On\\" (Chuck Berry)<br />  \\"Not Fade Away\\" (Charles Hardin/Norman Petty)<br />  \\"It's All Over Now\\" (Bobby Womack/Shirley Jean Womack)<br />  \\"Little Red Rooster\\" (Willie Dixon)<br />  \\"The Last Time\\"<br />  \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\"<br />  \\"Time Is on My Side\\" (Jerry Ragovoy)<br />  \\"Get Off of My Cloud\\"<br />  \\"Heart of Stone\\"<br />  \\"19th Nervous Breakdown\\"<br />  \\"As Tears Go By\\" (Jagger/Richards/Andrew Loog Oldham)<br />  \\"Paint It, Black\\"<br />  \\"Under My Thumb\\"<br />  \\"Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?\\"<br />  \\"Ruby Tuesday\\"<br />  \\"Let's Spend the Night Together\\"<br />  \\"We Love You\\"<br /><br />Disc two<br /><br />  \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\"<br />  \\"Honky Tonk Women\\"<br />  \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\"<br />  \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\"<br />  \\"Gimme Shelter\\"<br />  \\"Street Fighting Man\\"<br />  \\"Wild Horses\\"<br />  \\"She's a Rainbow\\"<br />  \\"Brown Sugar\\"<br />  \\"Happy\\"<br />  \\"Tumbling Dice\\"<br />  \\"Angie\\"<br />  \\"Rocks Off\\"<br />  \\"Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker)\\"<br />  \\"It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)\\"<br />  \\"Fool to Cry\\"<br /><br />Disc three<br /><br />  \\"Miss You\\"<br />  \\"Respectable\\"<br />  \\"Beast of Burden\\"<br />  \\"Emotional Rescue\\"<br />  \\"Start Me Up\\"<br />  \\"Waiting on a Friend\\"<br />  \\"Undercover of the Night\\"<br />  \\"She Was Hot\\"<br />  \\"Streets of Love\\"<br />  \\"Harlem Shuffle\\" (Earnest Nelson/Robert Relf)<br />  \\"Mixed Emotions\\"<br />  \\"Highwire\\"<br />  \\"Love Is Strong\\"<br />  \\"Anybody Seen My Baby?\\" (Jagger/Richards/k.d. lang/Ben Mink)<br />  \\"Don't Stop\\"<br />  \\"Doom and Gloom\\"<br />  \\"One More Shotue\\"<br />  \\"Start Me Up\\"<br />  \\"Waiting on a Friend\\"<br />  \\"Undercover of the Night\\"<br />  \\"She Was Hot\\"<br />  \\"Streets of Love\\"<br />  \\"Harlem Shuffle\\" (Earnest Nelson/Robert Relf)<br />  \\"Mixed Emotions\\"<br />  \\"Highwire\\"<br />  \\"Love Is Strong\\"<br />  \\"Anybody Seen My Baby?\\" (Jagger/Richards/k.d. lang/Ben Mink)<br />  \\"Don't Stop\\"<br />  \\"Doom and Gloom\\"<br />  \\"One More Shot
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Requires too many permissions. Update won't install, making app unusable.<br /><br />The only permissions this app should require are internet and file system.
B00BSBUZPK|4.0|Great history of a great band!  Concert footage of a 1978 show is like going back to the good 'old days.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|A story that illustrates how IT aligned with business needs to reverse the undervalued view of IT by the business.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is a must read for everybody. You will not be able to stop reading till the very end.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|I always enjoy the complete series.  Escapism is great and welcomed.  I will continue to watch them over and over.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I have been waiting forever for this...a Magic app! If you are a fan, you will love this, plays exactly like you would expect. Newcomers, this is the standard for collectible card games, worth a try. Cons: it is huge. The graphics are great, the gameplay is awesome, but the price is size. You'll need at least 2 gigs free for the installation and update. It took a lot of work to get it running on my Nexus, and some time, but it runs fine now. If you want the full of thing, it will cost 10 bucks, but it is worth it. You can do a lot with the free version, so give it a shot. They did a great job with this app, I can't recommend it enough.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|It was a lot of fun.I have a gun time playing and making my reef special and cool. I love it
B008OOYALE|3.0|Dragon story is fun, but compared to the other village games, such as dragonvale, and dragon city, it isn't that great. Also, gems are freaking hard to get.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|Considering how much this preamp costs, it is great for starting out. It's a great little box, good quality and really easy to set up. I'd recommend it.
B009CF7GRY|4.0|Mindless movie for a relaxing evening.  I wasn't disappointed.  Lots of fun and energy in the movie.  Very Good flick.
B009HEMW4W|4.0|Just like MIB 2, I thought this was a fun movie to watch....very silly stuff...creepy aliens but nothing scary so suitable for kids over 10 years old.  My favorite character was the time traveler guy....could be real....gives you something to think about and that's what I like about these kinds of films.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was not too difficult, but challenging in a fun way. I Can't wait for an update for more rooms.
B000HEVALC|5.0|The recording is a little hard to hear, you really have to turn up the volume, but it's not bad considering when this was recorded, and what equipment they were using back then. I think it's definitely worth it to get a copy for yourself and listen to this jam session by 4 of the all-time greats!
B000I8G5NA|4.0|I thought this was a fun movie to watch....very silly stuff...creepy aliens but nothing scary so suitable for kids over 10 years old.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I gave my wife a packag deal for our anniversary and she is still excited about her leather case. This is a must to protect the kindle fire HD
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|LOved this version. Got to see it in the theater the day after christmas, and knew right away that I wanted the DVD. Hugh Jackman maked a wonderful Jean Valjean. Sasha Baron Cohen is a delightfully evil villan, con man and crook. Reccomended for anyone over 13 because of necessary thematic material.
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|For this 20 year veteran Joe has exemplified what it is to still be relevant in the game and how to stay at the top of it. I love this CD, especially the duet with Fantasia. Buy it you will love it from beginning to the end.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The ending was pretty disappointing to be honest. For me the best book in the series was the first and from there they just went downhill.  SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />I get that after Katniss went through that war and the death of her sister that of course she was going to be depressed for AWHILE. But she basically went through the rest of her life unhappy even after she had kids and married Peeta. I can think of SO many ways the last couple chapters of the book could be made a lot better.<br /><br />First of all, Collin's could have written another 50, 100 pages just about katniss' life with Peeta and her kids. I need more information!!!!! I want to know how her and Peeta grew close again. I want to know about her children. And I think it's so disappointing how the only reason she had kids was because Peeta wanted them. It makes it seem like Katniss doesn't even love her daughter and her son.<br /><br />I hate what happened to Peeta! How could Suzanne Collin's do that!?  He hated katniss because of what Snow did to him. How could he ever love katniss the same again after that? HE CAN'T AND THAT SUCKS! And there we go back to the other subject of needing more info on how they grew back together again. I don't get how Peeta can go from strangling katniss to marrying her!<br /><br />Katniss had ZERO closure with Gale. She went back to district 12 and they never talked again. At least she could have had a goodbye to Gale or told him she loved him but just not the same as Peeta. Katniss and Gale could have continued there friendship and visited each other sometimes but nope. He was basically ditched out of the story!<br /><br />The rest of the book was good and I really liked it but as you can see, I have a lot of problems with the end. I'm hoping that in the movie they will add some more to the ending with katniss, Peeta, Gale and katniss' kids. I would have rated five stars but with that bad ending, I don't think so. I mean, it was really good and if you read the firsttwo then duh, read this one too! But it had a pretty depressing ending and I think a lot of people agree. Just read the other comments.....
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|BEST GAME EVER if you like scaryness best game I got 7/8 pages then he killed me I RAGED but who cares GET THE GAME
B00CW665VI|4.0|It was fun and some of the lines were pretty funny because the man is the narrator. It's a relaxing book.
B00AEBEQW8|4.0|Sweet story, clever, and very relatable to children and adults. It is wonderfully supported by full-page, charming, child-like illustrations. As a former ES media specialist, i think it is a perfect read-aloud that could be adapted to other situations or to start discussions. I immediately wanted to buy it for my art teacher friends. My only quibble is the title. The crayons never say they are going to quit in the story. The illustration of them holding picket signs is unnecessary. If I was still teaching, I would probably have the children pick a better title. Please note that the Kindle version is not as successful as the hardback because the print is hard to read. It seems you can only enlarge parts of text at a time which ruins the flow of the story. I purchased both even so, I liked it so much.
0689835604|5.0|My son gets distracted for a good amount of time while we go through this book. We go through it four or five times in one sitting and he's still interested.
0316223239|1.0|The story told in the voice of the child is \\"fingernails on the black board\\" irritating. Much time was spent wading through the daily routine in \\"Room\\". Boring! The plot itself left a whole lot to be desired and you knew prety much where the story was going. I couldn't believe I actually stuck with it to the end. I thought surely this is going somewhere......well, not so much. I certainly don't get all the stellar reviews. Pass this one up unless you want to be bored and frustrated. I read this book in the form of a borrowed paperback. Boy am I glad I didn't spend money on it.
B000PKX2KA|3.0|We bought this for our boat. Unfortunately, we were in pretty rough seas and our computer fell off of the navigation station.  The unit that plugs into the computer broke, so now the thing is useless.  :(
B000LXQVA4|5.0|Ordered this for my 7-month old son. This jumper takes a lot of abuse from him. He jumps like a madman but the jumper still hasn't fallen apart--been a couple of weeks. Only downside is that his thunder thighs are a little bit of a tight fit.
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|Outstanding, in-depth study of a 'god' of sushi; his dedication, mastery, and advancement of the art - yet simplicity - of perfection in task.  Very interesting story of Jiro, his sons, and the staff; and all the work that's required in selection, preparation, and delivery of a 15-minute, $400 suchi dinner that is rated as a life-experience by many.  Personally, I'd like to visit his son's shop for a more relaxed experience.
0316044938|4.0|I loved this book. The story was sad and heart wrenching but gave an overture of hope that there is more beyond this world. I saw the movie and was disappointed. The book did not disappoint.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really neat game like it a lot. It's a lot of fun. Horses seem real. Competitions seem more real. Good prizes. Easy to make friends.
B005LAIH2M|3.0|Entertaining variation on the theme / adult witch hunters.  Fair to vary-good action sequences.  Hampered by weak script and lack of character development; it is still good summertime DVD to pop in and watch with friends.
0316096199|4.0|I read this after reading 'The Lovely Bones' and was unable to put it down until finished. It's not a long book so it didnt tie me up for days, but it was compelling.  The emotion with which it was written was certainly felt. A very very thought provoking book.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|***may contain spoilers***<br /><br />from looking at the reviews on this book it seems people either love it or hate it. The first time I read this was when it first came out in paper back and I loved it, so much so that between books now, i decided to re-read and just settle into a well known book aimed at adults.<br /><br />Now that I know the books were originally designed for fan-fic for Twilight, the 'young style' characters<br />make a bit more sense. But also because I'm a bit older now, they felt a bit hollow.<br /><br />I still really enjoyed Christian and Ana's relationship, it's firey and passionate, but I feel that Ana loses herself because she doesn't want to tread on someone elses toes. Which makes me think this relationship is damaging to her. But She'll work through it and find herself, which is the main thing.<br /><br />Sex scenes were steamy and Ana's innocence to the sexual world makes everything just a little bit hotter. The only thing that drags it down is her \\"oh my\\"s which make me think PRUDE rather than innocent and then she'll drop the F bomb and next sentance is 'oh my' again, so it's not consistant.<br /><br />Most of the characters aren't consistant. Christian will allow Ana to touch him one minute on the shoulders and biceps and the next he's tensing. Ana wants him to hurt her then acts like a child when he does. After all her research, she should have known what it would intail.<br /><br />He buys her imac, ipad, ipod and a Blackberry phone..... If you're imac-person that much you're imac-person through and through.<br /><br />I understand somepeoples reservations on this book- especially if you live in the BDSM scene, I don't think there was much research involved, as it seems a little like Chrsistian is only in the scene because he was abused. I know many people would be angry at this, as they live the BDSM scene without being abused as a child. I think if I were into BDSM hardcore like Christian seems, this book would make me feelas if I were being portrayed as a horrible person, or an abuser.<br /><br />The characters felt quite 'young' both in their language, attitude and behaviour. But I think if I read this book in my late teens it would have been perfect, but coming up to 30- I need more depth and less \\"he loves me, he loves me not\\" mantras. She's always gasping and eye rolling and he's always smouldering. He's always being secretive and she's always suprised at his 'admissions' (which are always the same)<br /><br />Overall, Good start to a new series, and I can't wait to see the characters grow a little bit more in 50 shades darker.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I liked it.  Made you think and try different things.  Just wish there were more levels.  Worth playing.  This is a fun game!  Give us more.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works great! I can setup a specific time and days(s)  and just click the box if I want to turn it off. very simple and convenient!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|As if the second book wasn't bad enough! This one took it to another level of blahhhhh. The book was so monotone I'll be surprised if I waste my time on the next
B008VBYN80|1.0|Had two heroes and had been playing for long time  and with multiple friends and woke up to starting over.  no more and maybe no more any from this company....Had just purchased diamonds with real money.  Will get no more.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This was a very enjoyable read, a little predictable, but a lovely story, good characters and I enjoyed the dialect.  Glad I read it.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|challenging but not too difficult.<br />fun for all ages. passes the time with variety of interesting rooms. i recommend.<br />great idea.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|It was a good movie. Screenplay seemed low budget while the actors tried to hard to be &#34;southern&#34; which was more of an annoyance thru the whole movie. It was a good movie to pass the time.<br /><br />Certain things/actions in the movie didn't make sense. One scene had the teenager witch reach towards the moon as to be grabbing it. Nothing happened. But the other witches said she is strong. N one else can do that... What..... Reach in the air and pretend to grab something? They should have pretended the moon shook or something to give the movie/scene some sort of an effect as to something really happened.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Very predictable movie and not as good as some of the originals. Acting was stiff and dialogue was all over the place. Not a good sequel.
B007FH9GA6|5.0|the way this movie is put together, flows so much better than the Swedish version. The Swedish version seems rushed compared to this, and the flash backs add so much to it.
B008602KQI|5.0|By far this is the Best movie I watched this year. Excellent casting and adaptation from the original books. Watch it
B001O4XWJM|4.0|I have read all the Virgil Cole books and enjoyed them.  I wanted to see this movie, and rented it from Amazon.  The movie itself was very much Parker.  The actors/actresses were great matches with the book characters in my opinion.  I would recommend the book and the movie.  The experience in renting the movie through Amazon was simple... no problems, and I will probably do that again in the future.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I got this for my kids cause they like the guy flying around on his jetpack. Easy to control which is good for my five year old.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It was a good game and I enjoy playing  it. Good way to waste time and very interesting game to play.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I like this  game. Any one can play. I like to hear when he break  his neck. Lol great stuff.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like this game cause of the hidden objects which is my favorite game but the only problem is collecting diamonds which you can't collect and kind of expensive to purchase.
B007WULJ5G|1.0|I watch hardcore movies, nothing really shocks me so after waiting a few years for this, I jumped on it.  Big mistake -- for a movie with beautiful cinematography and an attractive and capable cast -- not to mention an extremely provocative plot -- this movie was huge, and I mean huge, let down.  I have heard it described as a masterpiece.  It is a masterpiece, a master piece of junk.  The gore, nudity, sex, and violence did not bother me at all, what bothered me was how it falls apart.  I do think that the gore/nudity/sex/violence was not used constructively and was used, instead, for the shock value that lesser movies employ to make up for other shortfalls.  I think that people who hail this as masterpiece may simply want to appear cool or more hip than people who are shocked and repulsed by the movie.  I know good from bad and this is the latter.  I would love to see this premise re-done into a quality production -- one that totally involves the audience; instead we are mere spectators to exploitive sex and violence that transcends into what it supposedly despises, it becomes a caricature of itself.  I understand what we may take away from the movie on a few different levels but I find it poorly executed.  The most controversial scenes may be distasteful to some but they are not what turned me off from the movie, the movie turned me off from the movie.  Do not waste your time.  One more thing, I have read this compared to MARTYRS -- this movie is nowhere in the league of MARTYRS.  MARTYRS is a brutal wonderful film, this is a wonderfully brutal film and that's all it is: brutal.  Check out CARGO on YouTube, a seven Australian short, that without dialogue, a big budget, and only seven minutes long that affected me more that A SERBIAN FILM.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Anything Michael does is always perfect; he is so entertaining and he chooses the best songs and I would buy any future albums even if he just hums.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I got this for my kid cause they like chomping on the fish. Easy game for my kid to control.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I like it because I like Disney and I haven't seen the movie so it is a<br />great game so I would like the movie better.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Robert Downey, Jr and Jude law worked well together.  The story plot was interesting.  Guy Ritchie is a good director.
B000089RV6|5.0|I have looked in several stores for this album.  My Grandson borrowed it and did not return it.  I appreciate that you had it at a very affordable price.  The sound quality is awesome and you got it to me very quickly.  I recommend Amazon to my friends when they are looking for hard to find albums.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This was a birthday gift for my wife who thinks this series is 5 star, all 3 years.I began in year 2 to watch it.

B000SEJHRA|5.0|Brilliant. I actually googled 'pass out from laughing' to see if it were actually possible. I came close several times.
B0042816YK|4.0|This is a good &#34;girly&#34; movie that I watched with my teen daughter. I just started reading the book so I can't say how it compares to that (usually movies fall short anyway) but this was an entertaining movie nonetheless. Inspired by true events - this makes you want to get out of the rut of daily &#34;life&#34; and encourages you to seek out adventure in your own way! I think it has a good storyline and I would purchase again.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|Very scary movies. I love it. It's the kind of movie on the scale of Godzilla, and<br />the story line is great as well. Thank you again.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Not my normal fare but it grabbed me from the beginning. It is full of real life experiences tragic and humorous.<br />Very well written.
B005DC68NI|5.0|For anyone that is going to self publish I would highly recommend this book. Tons of useful advice. Worth every cent!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|What can you say. It's the Beatles, and this compilation includes all of their<br />greatest hits. I play it all of the time. Thank you again.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|It is what it is and if you love Game of Thrones this is what you want.  Best on Blu-ray!
B006BAEQB2|5.0|After all, this is yet another wonderfully insightful historic novel authored by the incomparable Philippa Gregory! I have been an avid reader of this lady's writings for years, and I've yet to be even slightly disappointed by any of her works. She has an amazing ability to bring her readers directly into the Times, the People we have heard of and may think we know a bit about these fascinating individuals now cast in folklore and make us realize that they were indeed quite human - with genuine emotions and needs, and aids the Reader to be \\"of that moment\\" and in this book, casts a very intriguing light onto King Richard III & Queen Anne that supersedes that which many in present day even still revile and demonize. Especially King Richard III has been despised, ridiculed, and perceived as one of the most heinous, vile, and hated monarchs in the history of British monarchy. He has rarely been cast in a good light, despite the fact that he was a beloved brother and loyal to his brother King Edward and his brother George. To be quite honest, I'd never even heard any detail of his marriage to Anne aside from the fact she was indeed Warwick The Kingmaker's second daughter, and until this book I'd known nothing of her brief 1st marriage. As most write it, Richard was forced to marry the Warwick \\"spare\\" to \\"keep up appearances\\" & of course, a politic and political duty! I'm thankful Philippa Gregory does offer historic relevance to the unsung, and typically altogether ignored women of this time! These women were not deaf mutes who flitted here and yon doing needlework 24/7 while lying in bed scared stiff & nothing more than, forgive my crudeness,\\"sperm receptacles\\" &/or if much more than AKC registered \\"pedigreed bitch for breeding\\". Perhaps they were thought of that way, but I don't believe this was the case for the majority. I certainly believe, given the lack of the papal dispensation and the law regarding Anne's inheritance that IF Richard had not truly loved and respected Anne and the sanctity of marriage, . He could have and would have been rid of her easily and quickly if he didn't genuinely love and care for her. He never failed her in that respect.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|My wife loves this movie. She plays it all the time. The Blue-ray quality is amazing, and<br />cd works well. Thank you again.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Loved the book. It reads like Tolstoy with all the characters and their entwining relationships. The history comes alive. I will definitely read the whole trilogy.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Bought this case 6 months ago and there is nothing &#34;Life Proof&#34; about it. Water leaked into the case and broke my phone. To top it off when I got my replacement phone, I decided to use the case for protection only...... Yup as you expected, it  started to fall apart all over the place and pieces started to break off! Don't buy!
B00AGKH7K0|4.0|I grew up in the 1970s and I still have my vinyl LPs of Eric Burdon & Animals Greatest Hits and Eric Burdon's work with War but I haven't listened to Eric Burdon for years. I was not familiar with any of his solo releases over the last few decades.<br /><br />So when this album came up as an Amazon Recommendation while I was browsing Amazon recently I was initially hesitant about buying it. Frankly, I'd seen Eric Burdon recently on one of those PBS Pledge Drive shows which have 1950s and 60s acts performing their best known material in between segments of PBS asking for financial support from viewers. I wasn't very impressed with Eric Burdon's performance on PBS; it sounded like his voice was totally shot and worn out.<br /><br />So I was hesitant about buying this one. But after reading some of the five star reviews I decided to take a chance on it and check it out.<br /><br />As it turned out, I was quite impressed by this album. Burdon's voice isn't worn out after all. The material on the album is co-written by Burdon with the exception of a cover version of Bo Diddley's \\"Before You Accuse Me\\" (also covered by CCR back in the early 1970s) and it is of quite high quality. The band backing Burdon on this release is comprised of some very solid musicians.<br /><br />So while I don't rate this a 5 star album, I still rate it a very solid 4 stars. Anybody else who is initially hesitant about buying this one, as I was, might want to check it out.
1567184855|5.0|What does happen to us after we die? Wouldn't we all love to know? Proof of Heaven was a little bit scary when Eben Alexander described the worm world like dirty Jell-O that he sank into after death. Journey of Souls provides a more comforting scenario of the life between the earthly realm and that beyond. I gave this  book five stars because it is a read that I didn't want to put down.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This series is a real surprise.  The characters are that - real!  My husband and I sit and guess where the storyline is going - we are always pleasantly surprised!
B00C2IF9SQ|5.0|It is a great book. Once I started, I could not stop reading. Very few athletes have the courage to confront and make public their dark moments.<br />Beginning with her parents, Romanian coaches, 14 years old injured living the Olympic dream, emancipation, judges, court orders, humiliation by the press,<br />and discovering that she has one more sister, her life is full of events. Dominique is sharing with the world a side of the very famous Romanians coaches<br />that it was and is still dismissed. I applaud her for that.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|Not worth your money trust me. Glitches out too much. Bad story line. Terrible controls. Takes ages to install. And last but not least it freezes up my kindle way too much
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel. The writing was wonderful. I got lost in the story and involved with the characters.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Good graphics, interesting and challenging puzzles. Hints help if you are totally lost, but try to keep from using them if you really want a challenge. Worth the $2, for the few hours of fun. Much better than some I've played, zooming, buttons, leavers etc. all work well. Story interesting but not too hoakey. Will look forward to more from fireproof games.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|This book was wonderfully written, and highly informative. I love the way that this author writes.This book gives a lot of insight on human behavior, and is a joy to read. Throughout its entirety the author refers to stories of great conversations he's had in his life which offer great examples of implementing the techniques he describes. Robin Dreeke is highly insightful as well as humorous while explaining how to build quick rapport in this 5 star book. I recommend this to anyone who seeks great conversations.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|If you've been having issues with the kindle app for android instantly shutting down you might want to go here: [...] to get the older stable version so it'll work again (you might have to go back a few versions).<br /><br />*Be Advised, I had to go all the way back to 3.8.2.4 to get the app to work on my HTC one again.*  I don't necessarily need the most up to date version of something so long as I am still able to use it for its intended purpose.<br /><br />After acquiring the apk drop it somewhere on the device and use a program like astro or ES file explorer to locate and run the install.  It *should* let you open the app and work for you after that, provided it worked before you downloaded the app update to 4.1.  Getting an older version of an app for a particularly older device might take some guess and test to get one that works.<br /><br />The rating is for the app overall after all of my experience on multiple devices, one device acting the fool doesn't change my love for the app and the (in my experience) over all satisfaction I've had with the kindle app over the years.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|For the serious seeker, disturbed by headlines about the behavior of people that we do not understand, this book gives us an honest journey to the roots that produce this complex culture and, hopefully, understand how our own roots have also made us who we are.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This book is probably the best book I've ever read. The plot goes along nicely, but with huge twists in th  midst of it all. Great ending for the whole series!!
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot. At times the message of connecting with other people is not subtle, but it doesn't take away from the movie at all.<br /><br />Maybe we are monsters, but there is hope.<br /><br />Watch this movie!
B0028R3NCU|4.0|work as i expected it , can use up to 32gb card on the reader ( never tried 64gb) , it is small and easy to carry around..
B009R659L8|1.0|I have devoured every book by MHK and was looking forward to this one too, but oh, boy, was this one a mistake! It felt very juvenile, like it was a high school literature assignment and the student got a C-. It was long-winded and so boring, the characters had no \\"meat on their bones\\", just sort of haphazardly thrown together and hoping for a match. This was one the biggest disappointments for me and it took all my willpower to finish it. Read it at your own peril, but it seems that many (333, at the last count) loved the book. Each to its own?
1423140605|2.0|[NO SPOILERS]<br /><br />I was new to Rick Riordan until I picked up Book One and Two of the Heroes of Olympus Series.  First book about the Romans, second the Greeks, it was all new to me and very fascinating.<br /><br />This is a vague summery of the book:  Travel a bit, stop and kill monsters, travel, stop and kill monsters, travel, stop find out where to go next, travel, stop and kill monsters. Rinse and repeat.  There really isn't much story/character development as the first two books.  It just a monster killing adventure with a very thin plot to go with it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Talking to a co-worker one day, she mentioned her cousin, Gillian, had written a book.  I found the book at Amazon and couldn't put it down.  All three of her books are that way!!  Can't wait for number four!!

B005U9REU0|5.0|Because this was one of my favorite movies when I was young and was excited to find it and be able to share it with my 7 yr old who also seemed to enjoy it as well.
159562015X|1.0|I was unaware that this book is useless without a code that can only be used once. All used books will have an invalid code, so you can't actually find your strengths online.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|It is just too much fun to stop. If you are someone who reads 'comments' online, this community is just as funny
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|This was pretty good. I enjoyed the friendship between the characters. would like to watch it again later with my gal friends
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like this game,but having to get points to unlock more games is annoying. I understand why you have to get points, but I end up playing the same games over and over instead of advancing
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This is a very addictive game.  By far the best bingo game I've found however there is room for improvement like more daily credits and being able to turn your coins into bingo credits.
B003EV6DBM|4.0|I really appreciated this season as the plots went together very well and told a very cohesive story-line.  Naturally, it is episodic but there were elements that tied the whole season together.  I also thought the actor who played the new doctor did an excellent job.<br /><br />I had a couple issues with the DVD packaging.  There was no episode list except on the actual disks so if a disk was in the machine you couldn't see what was on it by looking on the box or inner packaging.  I had to go to the menu on the disk to know how many episodes were there.  I like having a list so I can see where I am in the season.  Also, the plastic DVD holders came unglued very quickly, there for making the packaging not stay together.<br /><br />Overall, amazing season, episodes and acting but the DVD packaging was slightly disappointing.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Picks up where book one left off and I have not yet watched the series on HBO.  I am waiting until I am done reading the books first.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Can't wait for more of the crossover the story's is so good need more about them love the book thanks
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Passionate writing with an incredible amount of detail. George R. R. Martin has constructed a world that is exciting and believable.
B008OOYALE|1.0|To me it seems really do similar to another game butbeithbworse graphics. Sorry to say but I would not recommend it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show n cast. Story line was awesome.  I cant wait for season 3 this month. Need to buy me some copies
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I bought this for another person but he seems to be fairly enthralled with this game and constantly asks to play it so it was worth the money.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game. It really gets your mind thinking.  Wonderfully made! Fun to play if you're bored, in a waiting room, or if you just want to test your skills.
B001IF252C|4.0|I use firmware v1.03 of this adapter with a 2012 Retina Macbook Pro hooked up to an Auria 27\\" 2560 x 1440 display and it works fine. Once in a blue moon it will incorrectly display static when resuming from a sleeping Mac, but sleeping/resuming again makes the problem go away. There are other times when the display appears to blank out and come back in a second or two for no apparent reason -- not related to the display sleep / energy saver settings. Despite these quirks, overall I'm happy with this setup.<br /><br />Others warn of problems with earlier firmware versions of this adapter. At the time I'm writing this (2013), chances are that the inventory of older firmware versions have already been sold out -- it's likely you'll get a v1.03 model if you buy a new one. Otherwise, according to Apple knowledge base article TS3232, one can get older firmware models replaced for free. To quote:<br />\\"Symptoms: Learn what to do if you encounter continuous flickering on your monitor or if you have issues when waking your Mac from sleep while using a Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter.<br /><br />Resolution: These issues may occasionally occur with some HP or Samsung LCD monitors connected by a Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter with version 1.01 or 1.02 firmware. If you experience these issues and your adapter firmware version is 1.01 or 1.02, you can exchange your adapter for one with firmware version 1.03.

B0063M22QO|5.0|Enjoyed the levels. The game was a quiet way to spend the evening. If you like may John you will enjoy this diversion
B008MEM24S|5.0|Challenging, and completely adorable. If you enjoy problem -solving and Perry, you'll love this game!  Includes the occasional adorable cameo by Heinz!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is the best game I have ever played .You get new places like Tokyo ,France and lots more. It didn't have anything wrong with it and I am glad it was free .
B008DVKTMW|5.0|This is a shockingly good sounding first album.<br /><br />Thank God - *finally* - for a new, young band that - although influenced by shoegazer/Krautrock bands of recent decades - sounds futuristic, sophisticated, powerful, atmospheric, rather than the recent dirge of pretend \\"indie-rock\\" groups that really just sound like a generic wave of \\"folk-revivalist\\" \\"neo-bluegrass\\" comedy bands. Thank God.
B0054SMID0|4.0|Thought it was a good movie. I think Mathew McConaughy and Marisa Tomei are both great actors. A must see if you like lawyer movies
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app reminds me of the logic needed for the game Myst.  I loved that it took some thought, but wasn't frustratingly difficult.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|I am very happy with my purchase. Before I bought I saw it in a store and I loved it.<br />Once I got it as a self gift, I knew my choice was the right one.<br />Everyone who notices it compliments on how nice it is. The advantage is that is elegant and is not a shiny watch.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|We loved Susan Boyle ever since she was on the talent show. She hasn't disappointed us yet!  Great musical voice!!!
B00CLZ4B4I|3.0|It was definitely worth watching, and I am not sorry we bought it, but it is not destined to be a watch over and over classic.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|I'm not a big Mickey Haller fan--his personality irritates me sometimes. Harry Bosch--well, I love Harry. Even when Harry irritates me, I like him and what he stands for.<br /><br />I enjoyed this novel immensely, although I must agree with another reviewer who felt that Jessup was vague. I would have liked to have a bit better background on him. That said, I liked the interactions between the characters--from Maggie to the two daughters to the SIS team. I felt like the book flowed very well and that Mickey & Harry took a step or two closer to really being half-brothers.<br /><br />The trial was interesting to me--the whole having a trial where you couldn't let on that there was a previous trial. The testimonies were intriguing. I really liked the sister--what a tough character!<br /><br />Another intriguing aspect of this novel is the way it was written--from Haller's chapters in the first person point of view and then from Harry's using the third person. It worked perfectly to differentiate the voices and observations of the characters.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked it and days later, it resounds.
B00CFOXBX2|4.0|This was a good, entertaining movie. It was a bit slow, but had enough twists and tuns to keep you intrigued.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I found out about it from my little sister who always plays it.  I started to watch her play and it looked very fun. Great game for anyone, not only children.

B00AZNEW5G|5.0|ZDT is a director Kathryn Bigelow's brilliant telling of the hunt for Osama bin Laden, starting in the sand-blown huts of various CIA dark sites and culminating in the raid on UBL's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Little is held back - depictions of torture and brutality, even the infamous practice of waterboarding - in the hunt for information about UBL's whereabouts. The section of the film that details the operation by Seal Team Six is riveting. Shot alternatively in near darkness and via night-vision goggles worn by the troops, the operation is shown second by second, with its missteps (killing the unarmed wife of a resident, the crash of one of the copters) and successes (killing bin Laden, ransacking his computers and files). But while the film depicts America's greatest success in the War on Terror, its mood is subdued -- not quite celebratory.<br /><br />The film's main character, Maya, a fictional female CIA agent played by Jessica Chastain (and who may represent a single person or the hundreds of analysts and agents who worked on the hunt) is a bit of a cipher. She is slight and freckled, is called a \\"killer,\\" and is inexplicably drawn to take down the Al Qaeda leader. Maya is hardened, or pretends to be, and unfazed by violence. But in spite of representing the desire of the American public for UBL's scalp, she's kind of hard to root for. She is taciturn, cold and driven by unknown motives. She unflinchingly watches a man beaten to provide evidence, then coolly tells him that the severity of his treatment is in his own hands. She has no backstory, though it would be easy (if clich&eacute;d) to give her one - say, that her Dad died in the Twin Towers or on Flight 93. But though the film begins with a series of desperate phone calls from 9/11, that attack seems almost beside the point to Maya -- as though her desire to take down UBL has taken on a life of its own, apart from any connection to the assault on the homeland.<br /><br />There are strange inklings throughout the movie that we are watching the intersection of physical reality and its underlying shadow of meaning, For instance, the search for bin Laden's courier and the raid on Abbottabad are told realistically and in detail. But the moment of UBL's death is curiously concealed, and is just-so-slightly inconsistent with written accounts. (Caution: spoilers ahead!) Two SEALS creep toward Osama's 3rd floor hideout via a narrow stairway. They hear a noise and shoot through a curtained door. When they enter, UBL is on his back, dead or nearly so, with two of his wives screaming nearby. The SEALs pump two more rounds into bin Laden to ensure his demise. An AK-47 is seen in the room, but mounted on the wall above UBL's bed, not even within arm's reach. Viewers who might want to see him die a slow and painful death - face to face with his lethal visitors, perhaps, or menacing them with an automatic weapon -- will be disappointed. His death seems anti-climactic- intricately planned and executed, to be sure -- but hardly the cinematic climax that such films promise. Does Bigelow show us what really happened? Is there a message in this her restraint at the moment of triumph? Or is she exercising poetic license to make a point? If so, what point? That exterminating this world-menacing terrorist leader was the equivalent of killing a fly with a sledgehammer?  Osama bin Laden, the most-wanted terrorist kingpin, murderer of thousands, ends up being an unarmed medieval in a robe and turban, hiding with his wives and kids in a ramshackle concrete \\"fortress,\\" tracked down over 10 years and the cost of how much treasure, and eliminated by the world's most disciplined, armed and technically advanced armed force of all time. If Kathryn Bigelow is trying to say something here, I can only wonder what it is.<br /><br />For all its realism, great writing and fine acting, ZDT is hard to applaud whole-heartedly. Maybe we have just become nuanced about our place in the world. Openlyhating a militant Muslim and cheering his death is perilously close to hating everyday Muslims - our workmates and neighbors. Better not to go there. Then there's the whole speculative depiction of Operation Neptune Spear, the raid on UBL's hideout. Given the secrecy of the raid, and the reluctance of most of the participants to talk about it, we aren't completely sure what happened. We do know that Bigelow made some possibly unhistorical choices. The depictions of UBL's nasty head wound are cleaned up here. Who knows what else was doctored to make the raid more palatable? Another issue with cheering for the film is the violence and self-propelling viciousness that we are asked to accept as the means for bringing bin Laden to justice. I am not naïve enough to think war and espionage are pretty. But I was unable to walk away from ZDT without a few thought about the morality of torture and \\"extraordinary rendition,\\" that sanitized term for sending suspects to countries where physical and mental abuse of prisoners is accepted.<br /><br />At the end of the film, Maya is bundled, alone, into a cargo plane. Asked where she'd like to go, she does not answer. Instead, she weeps softly. This scene brings her character closest to that of Americans reacting to the death of their number one enemy. Which is: not much at all. Whether due to war weariness or lack of confirming video, most of us did not rush into the streets when we heard the news. A decade of searching had turned UBL into a dangerous, but fairly contained evil - a devil in a glass jar. His death had little influence on those who took to heart his call for jihad against the West. As the recent Boston Marathon bombings show us, the enemies of the West do not need a living UBL to inspire them. Self-radicalization may be bin Laden's toxic legacy to the world.<br /><br />Why Maya's tears? Were they tears of relief at the end of a grueling, years-long effort to rid the world of an evildoer? Were they delayed tears of grief over friends who died trying to bring UBL to justice? Were they tears of lost innocence, mourning for a perhaps nonexistent time when Americans didn't torture and were not put in a position where they had to? Did the death of bin Laden, the man whose death had overtaken her entire career, leave her with a sense of lost purpose? Or did she see the death of Osama bin Laden, after so much effort and expenditure,  as insignificant in relation to her expectations? We don't know.<br /><br />This ambiguity - not the detailed reconstruction of bin Laden's hideout or the tactics of Seal Team 6 -- may be the film's greatest achievement, depicting events hyper-realistically, while allowing their multifaceted sorrows and joys play out in the viewer's mind long after the closing credits.a militant Muslim and cheering his death is perilously close to hating everyday Muslims - our workmates and neighbors.

B00ATDOVNK|3.0|This game was pretty good I had fun playing it...and then it was over way too soon.  There also weren't very many hidden object scenes. I like the mini games and everything but I thought I bought a HO game and it really wasn't.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Need more.  Wicked blast. this was so much fun I wanted to play non stop. it was more fun then writing this review.
B00A2H9P98|5.0|I don't usually go to the movies to watch \\"boys\\" movies but we went as a group and that was the flick... so I decided that worse in worse I get a little bored.<br /><br />Boy, what a ride it was. It was actually an amazing movie. Perfect cinematography, visual effects were stunning, action was fast and kept you guessing and wondering all the time and things were happening like click.. click.. click..<br /><br />It made you laugh, it made you cry, it made you bite your fingers, it made you cover your eyes and it made you push into your chair.<br /><br />The movie is a bit violent at times as you can imagine when you have a  terrorist type of situation and attempt to make it realistic.. plus modern effects result in this type of things. However if you can phase out yourself through those moments then you can really be for an amazing ride.<br /><br />The characters are very believable, very real and very likable or hate-able..<br />Someone compare this movie to Die Hard. I would say that it is a bit like that<br />but then it is way more action packed and faster and Die Hard movies are bit older type of school, this was really top notch movie.<br /><br />I think that having such a young crew of actors from the president through the saving hero and his daughter helped to keep it fresh as opposed old president and all that.. to me it was very up to date.<br /><br />The girls in our group would close their eyes now and then during the movie but no one of us wanted to leave, we all were like sucked into the action.<br /><br />I personally loved the full fledge visual effects shown in so many angles and so fast that you were like WOOOOOOOOOOW! You totally felt part of this.. and that is why most all of us, even guys got teary eyes in few moments because<br />this is not only the action movie, it gets you emotional thinking<br />what if.. because this is so real looking and it is touching real life<br />people and real life situations however fictionalized, still you had your<br />president of your country, your capitol and all inside and the White House staff<br />and tourists and you could emotionally relate to the whole suffering and trauma..<br />Luckily the director made sure to lighten up the movie with goofy tour guide who was just plain awesome, with a daughter of the hero who was very likeable teenage girl with bit of attitude yet still likeable.. there were many situations that would really make you laugh.<br /><br />My most favorite funniest moment (spoiler alert! - don't read if you don't want to know what happens :))  :<br />When a president and the Hero guy are trapped in the elevator shaft and they trying to get out, the president tells the guy - \\"you just show  me what to do and I will do it\\".. so the guy jumps spider-style here there and up he goes..<br />and president looks at him jaw dropped kind of and answers:<br />\\"I ain't doing that s*** :)<br /><br />Oh really funny at times... REALLY funny!<br /><br />So yes, all in all, very well spend money and time. Memorable movie and definitely something I am going to watch more then once. I hope they won't cut too many scenes when making DVD as they usually make movies shorter. Watch it in the theaters first and so you will know if they did that. Most of my movies I got on DVD that I saw on big screen were \\"brutally modified\\".<br /><br />So bottom line.. none of the gals who were at the movie theater complained and all looked totally amazed by it.<br /><br />Totally recommend, ten thumbs up.

B005TVYVI2|1.0|I was looking forward to using the Tempo Trainer. The problem is it's EXTREMELY difficult to hear. I hear it (if I'm lucky) about one out of 5 beeps. I've tried many things to make it work. I put an earplug in the ear that's not close to the tempo trainer to try and cut out the normal sounds of the water as I swim, I've put the tempo trainer under my cap-directly on top of my ear., etc. Nothing helps. It is only possible to hear it when the device is completely below the surface of the water with no &#34;wash&#34; of water passing by your ear. On top of that if you breathe on both sides (as you should) forget about it. If the trainer enits a beep while it is out of the water (which it is whenever you are turned to that side for air) it's completely impossible to hear it. Obviously it works for some people, but I really can't see how. I'm really sorry I wasted money on this gadget.

Somehow, she managed to mix hilarity with brilliant nuggets of life lessons that were inspiring. I cannot say how many times I laughed out loud in inappropriate situations while listening to this story and if you laugh half as hard as I did, I'd still say you'd definitely be having a great time.<br />I honestly believe this is something everyone (women and men) would enjoy.

0525478817|5.0|This book was absolutely wonderful. I did not want to put the book down the whole time I read it! You will become emotionally invested in each and every character in the book and it will make you laugh and cry. Sometime you will be laughing and crying at the same time. Don't pass up an opportunity to read this book.
1455121924|2.0|This book contained convincing evidence to eliminate modern wheat from today's diet, but it proved to be quite boring and repetitive. It also came across as dogmatic at times which I despise when it comes to diet regardless of how much scientific evidence a doctor/researcher/expert/etc. has in their arsenal. It's very obviously written by a physician (and maybe for physicians?), and not a journalist or science writer as portions of the book discussed all of the chemical reactions that occur throughout the digestive system when consuming wheat in extreme detail (read: snooze fest). There were certain chapters that did present interesting information in regards to the \\"perfect, chronic poison\\" (Davis' words) that is modern day wheat. However, I'd recommend \\"Why We Get Fat: And What to Do About It\\" over this book.
B000L53D4O|4.0|4 stars because I didnt see it myself.  But my friend who I gifted it to seems to love it.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|it makes you think its not to hard and it is not to easy for a free game it is pretty good
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|These books ARE good, although I'm not sure I was as crazy about them as everyone else seems to be. I was very interested in seeing what happened next and you do learn to really care about the characters, but it definitely wasn't the greatest series I've ever read. I will say that the last book was my least favorite and I felt that the author just kind of &#34;gave up&#34; telling the story at the end.
B007WFR1MQ|5.0|First and foremost, if you haven't gotten the deluxe edition of this album- get it! It's got a cool booklet and contains a story inter-playing with the lyrics similar to the liner notes of Obsolete. I could go into detail about the storyline of The Industrialist, but I'm sure someone's already explained that a lot better than I could, so why bother boring you? To me, the best Fear Factory is the first two records for very different reasons. Soul of The New Machine- is a very raw and heavy record with some industrial overtones- something of a hybrid between Napalm Death meets Godflesh. On Demanufacture, the band shed some of it's filthy grindcore leanings in favor for some thrashier- and at the same time a futuristic industrial approach. More emphasis was put on a staccato machine gun ridden guitar that molds perfectly with double bass of frenzied pace. It's basically taking the blue print of heavier thrash bands were already doing at this time but sorta putting it under a microscope...<br />Which leads us to the last two fear factory releases. Mechanize was a welcome return to some punishing industrial influenced metal. It's been a long time since the group sounded so visceral...<br />Then, there's The Industialist, which to me- is the counterpart to records like Demanufacture and even Obsolete. (Minus the<br />nu-metal nonsense) The pacing in the first 5 or 6 tracks is downright amazing! The title track perfectly segues into Recharger - then to \\"New Messiah\\"- (one of my favorites besides the next couple). Something really emphasized  on this record, industrial nuance. It feels like a record from the future sonic-ally. Although, that's always been the case with Fear Factory on their better albums. Some may say that this record doesn't take enough chances, and while I agree, it still is a damn good release, at least in the first 5 or 6 songs. Productionwise- this and the previous record hit it square out of the park. I can't emphasize the word heavy enough. It's a great to listen to on good speakers especially in your car! I've always been a fan of Burton C Bell's vocal approach from the yelling to the clean vocal since the band's conception. It's become more refined since it's infancy, and over the years, has lost some of it's gutteral quality. (Again, go back to the band's first album to the second) \\"God Eater\\" to me- is the album's most experimental, and possibly my favorite song on the album.<br />It evokes something cool that I've only heard in Godflesh records, a mantra, a creepy melody, and downright bludgeoning riffs! There's more than a couple of memorable mantras - \\"No Gods, no kings, only man\\" and \\"They are not one of us!\\" are phrases delievered with a sense of urgency...<br />Then something happens in the last couple of tracks on the record: boring soundscapes that seem aimless & go on for what seems like forever. Personally, much like this happens on even the best FF albums, (Ie. \\"A therapy for pain\\"'s long outro bit)these are moments that blemish the record and keep me from thinking 'this is flawless album'. Such a shame, really cause the rest of this album lives up to being right up their with their classics...<br />If you are blessed enough to own the deluxe edition, a bonus track of Pitch Shifter's \\"Landfill\\" can be heard. Pretty faithful to their version with some FF overtones. Cool cover. The original is still my favorite.<br />Overall, the drum machine didn't spoil my love for this record, I know some didn't. But for me, it's well programmed and to me only enhances the \\"industrial\\" element. Kudos.

B005GSVFBE|4.0|Great movie but I was disappointed that despite having a blue-ray player I could only view this in 2D. Maybe this is common knowledge and I'm just slow on the uptake but wish I had known that before buying. Oh well!

B008LFY6NI|5.0|This is a very easy to use little app, but the artwork you can produce is great...I have been using my spin art designs as avatars, and have gotten some rave reviews.  I remember creating spin art designs at carnivals when I was a kid, and I used to love making designs.  This app is almost as much fun as the real thing.  I bought the extra design sets, cheap at .99 each, and have used every design.  Worth the money and lots of fun!

B007BVOF8E|1.0|This movie lost me in the first fifteen. I gave it another half an hour and finally tuned out. If you are a spy movie fan, give it a go but for regular flick chicks, this was hard to follow.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Clever story and well told, however, not quite believable.  Amy had parents who were both psychologists who couldn't tell that there was something very wrong with their daughter.  Obviously they didn't want to believe that their perfect daughter was a sociopath.<br /><br />Most parts of the story held together very well, but I find it hard to believe that the detectives who appeared to be pretty professional could just easily fall for the story of her kidnap and rape.  For instance, if her wealthy kidnapper had treated her so luxuriously, would he have used twine to tie her wrists?  A silk cord would have been more in character.  Also, would he have used a large butcher knife to cut what was obviously a very expensive steak?  I think a small steak knife would do.  Nonetheless, I fould it an entertanig read.
B006IVBSBU|5.0|I really enjoy this film because of its fast paced story line and the way the story keeps to standardized outbreak processes. It is a great teaching tool for health or infectious disease classes and it is top notch entertainment.<br /><br />Excellent thriller that I continue to watch again and again.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Lots of fun. However a few more instructions or an example would help people like me who don't play games often. Would like to be able to keep sound off but have to do that each time.

B000001EGA|5.0|Excellent!  I have the vinyl album, with the booklets and all, and have been waiting for a good deal on the CD.  Found it!  It's a great album and I only wish he would perform some of the songs in concert more often.  Granted, he has a great and rather large catalogue to choose from, but, still...  Stands the test of time!

B00BI73CVI|5.0|Wonderfully done! I was afraid that it would lose something being translated from theater to silverscreen, but it is amazing!
B008C20TDG|3.0|I find myself skimming the first part of every chapter as if they're writing extra portions to make the book larger.  I like the overall instruction and information, but it seems to have a lot of 'fluff'.  Very interesting topic though...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun puzzle rooms. as you go farther into it you get a good picture of how the puzzles are constructed.  makes you use your power of observation. not too difficult.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I decided to purchase the books after watching the HBO series.  I would suggest watching Season 1 of Game of thrones and then buy the books.  Now for me being that I am not a big reader watching season 1, I got to meet the characters and that is what I think about as I read.  The book gives each character another level of detail and insight on how people are connected and why do they act like they do.<br /><br />I recommend this to everyone.  At least you have another year until season 4.  Get on it!
B00AFWEPVI|5.0|I have used this app for a few months now. The camera option works much like the KF built in camera app, but with a few more options for zooming and whatnot. I use it in place of the built in app. It shows previews of the recent photos on the side, and it does NOT close after one photo. It works just fine.<br /><br />The video camera also works. It has smooth quality... no stuttering, and the sound is pretty darn good. The files save pretty large though, so you'll want to hook your kindle to your computer via usb cable to put the videos on your computer so you won't run out of space. It's pretty easy... I navigated to my Kindle on the computer, and then the DCMI folder in it to find the videos from this app.<br /><br />Overall, great app. Works fine. Easy to use. :-)
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A small treasure, and a story that I think will still be whispering in my mind for weeks to come. Thanks for this one Neil. Thank you very much.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is really fun, but it is really expensive to get stuff on that game. All in all it is a very entertaining game to play.
B008NA2HMI|5.0|I loved this book completely unbelievable how someone can live the way he did and survive to tell the tale. I highly recommend this book so people can see how some people live.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a really good game to play. I would recommend it to all ages. The easy ones were fun to play but it got harder and had you thinking about them a lot more.  I give props to the creators for developing such a wonderful and mind challenging game and I am only 13 and like it. I was introduced to it by a friend and now I have an addiction to flow. Btw if you like flow you are going to love bridges. It is similar to flow. Keep up the good work. God bless.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I love James Bond. Like love. But I don't know what it is about these new ones, it's so hard to get into it. The visual effects are over the top and the bond babes are not as hot as they used to be.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Short but to the point. Excellent in pointing out the different facets of effective communication, speaking being only one of them...!!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I am a super nerd so I obviously love this movie. It is a different view on Star Trek than the show my father grew up on. It is wonderful and spectacular.
B009YMKL4A|5.0|I watched this fantastic movie in a theater after an exam in summer 2011. It left a deep impression in my mind about the technology used in the movie. Therefore, I bought this 1080p HD movie in instant video version to watch and keep forever on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9''.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|You would thing a big star packed cast would pull this off, or the amazing power of visual effects... Wrong. The cgi didn't match with the live action, the acting was aweful, it was like Disney said, &#34;let us just throw money at it and the people will pay!&#34; . I am just happy I didn't spend $20 in theaters to see it.
1423101499|4.0|This is the fourth book in the Percy Jackson series.  I did not enjoy this one as much as the other ones. Probably because of all the romance drama.... But the action and story were wonderful as always.<br /><br />Percy's mother has been dating a teacher a named Paul blophis, but everyone thinks its blowfish.  He is a teacher at Goode School and has managed to get Percy enrolled into this school. Percy is unsure of this because of all the bad things that has happened to him in the past years and he does not want anything bad to happen, meaning monsters, and since Paul does not know that Percy is a Demi God he would not understand these attacks.<br /><br />During orientation of this new school, he runs into Rachel Elizabeth Dare, the mortal girl who saved from the evil skeletons at the Hoover Dam.  Of course, she recognizes him and pulls him away from the orientation demanding some sort of explanation for what happened at the Hoover Dam. If you can't remember Rachel, she was the mortal who could see through the mist, meaning she can see monsters. Of course not very long into that conversation Percy is attacked by monster cheerleaders (empousas) who set the school on fire and also managing to bring up the fact about enslaving the campers at camp half blood. Percy and Rachel run away and run until Annabeth. Annabeth was supposed to be meeting Percy for a \\"date\\" to the movies, even though they both claim it is not a date. Therefore, you cannot be surprised that Annabeth is not happy to see Rachel with Percy and gets very jealous, and angry and of course, the girls get mad at each other. (Again, I hate romance drama)<br /><br />Percy wants to go back to the camp and tell them about the Empous.  At camp half-blood they find a new sword master, Quintas.  Percy starts having weird prophetic dreams and random iris messages sent to him. Demi gods and minor gods are joining Kronos' army.  The old sea gods are stirring and causing trouble with Percy's dad. Grover is in trouble with the Coven council for not finding Pan and he has 3 weeks to find him or his searcher's license is going to be revoked. We find out at Luke is in the Labyrinth looking for Daedalus.  Luke is looking for Ariadne's string, which will help him through the labyrinth and help him invade camp half blood. Something has to be done so Annabeth is sent to get a prophecy from the Oracle.  Yes she finally is going to have her own quest for once.<br /><br />Annabeth does not share with the camp the whole prophecy but chooses Percy, Tyson and Grover to accompany her. This is not good because you are only allowed 2 people to help with a quest but annabeth insists that she needs all three of them. (Let me say I am very happy to see Tyson back in the book!)<br />So the group heads underground into the labyrinth in search of Daedalus and Grover's search for Pan. The danger levels are sky rocketing. The action gets more intense. The plot twists with every turn of the Labyrinth and while Percy might be a little dense at times, he has the ability to read people's emotions around him and this help with the different battles and allows him to quickly strategize.with the Coven council for not finding Pan and he has 3 weeks to find him or his searcher's license is going to be revoked.

B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I was probably going to like this movie if it was good or not. Can Jeniffer Lawrence or Brad Cooper do any wrong? I think not. It touched on some hard subjects and was still funny.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not very difficult but an entertaining way to test your brain.  Possibilities for some very difficult escapes if the developer pushes the envelope on the next round of puzzles.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|The last twenty minutes of this season completely blew my mind! Wowie! The whole season was spectacular! I think that nothing else can compare to this.
B004GJYRG4|1.0|I'm only giving this one star as I bought this specifically because it was shown to be the blu-ray/dvd/digital copy edition and what I got in the package was just the blu-ray edition.  I wanted the version with the dvd because I wanted to surprise my kids with it for our road trip in a few days.  I could have gotten this blu-ray for half the price at Target or Best Buy but  I'm going to keep it because we still need it for our blu-ray collection and I don't feel like going through the hassle of sending it back while I'm trying to get ready for our vacation.  I'm just very upset that I didn't get what was advertised.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Even though it's darker than the Tim Burton Batman movies, this is still a good watch. Really they all are.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I don't fully understand it yet but I like it. it is fun. weird. but fun. play everyday for bonuses.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book heavily deals with cancer so it hit close to home, but this book is amazing at questioning life in any way a person can.  I think reading this book could make you a better person if only by making you want to enjoy life more for the people who no longer can.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|Olson is an excellent writer and researcher.  I have read many books on the Depression and World War II era and this one ranks as one of the best!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|This game is fun but as you level up the quests decreases. I'm at level 17 and I hardly have any quests to do, the only thing I have is the daily homework, which I complete in no time at all. I just wished I had as many quests to do as when I started the game!
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|The stupid app don't give enough time other than that it's good but needs more time but if it gets more time every one will like the app I'm mad it cut me off
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I recently discovered Downton Abby and love it and I am so grateful to Amazon for offering Season 3 to it's prime members.  Shows like this make prime really worthwhile.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this app. It is fun and interactive. I enjoy feeding the horse and like to play the different levels.
B00992CF6W|4.0|my friends told me about this game and how it has villages mods and the nether but when I downloaded this it didn't have everything on the computer and Xbox one! At least put villages
1402238843|5.0|This is my third copy of Venetia, since I've worn two out.  The first cost me all of fifty cents. which shows how long ago I bought it.  So I'm delighted with it, no credit to Amazon or the publisher.  I'm glad Sourcebooks Casablanca is publishing Georgette Heyer's books in a sturdier format, but I HATE the trashy, stupid covers.  Still, this is my favorite Georgette Heyer novel, although there are others I also read and re-read.  I just wish we could reincarnate her and get more of her wonderful novels!
B00594XOZU|2.0|Well, I had this for my kindle fire (HD) but then I deleted it. I re- downloaded it and I forgot my password, so I had to create a new account. Any username I pick is unavailable. I typed in @fjdkcjsjfj and it didn't even work.. I don't know whats up.. but fix it?
B003LXM1RS|5.0|I listen to it all the way through on car drives. Not the most eclectic Scissor Sister album out there, but still a lot of fun.
1401235417|5.0|From the moment I started reading this comic i couldn't put it down. It is one of my favorites now! The artwork is great and the story is amazing. I highly recommend this comic!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely LOVE Subway Surfers! Its one of the most addicting games u will play. I find myself playing it for hours without getting bored!! :)
1401216676|5.0|The killing joke deluxe edition looks awesome and the artwork is fantastic! Even though I knew everything about this story before I bought it, I still enjoyed the story just as much. I highly recommend this comic!
0452289963|5.0|If you're searching for a spiritual read that blends lessons from several of the world's great religions, look no further. Written in simple language and peppered with deep truths, &#34;A New Earth&#34; can change the way you look at your life in positive ways. Highly recommended.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|good story but hidden objects sometime too small to see.  could have used more puzzles.<br />graphics were good and moving around the game was easy and fun.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I'm not much for lengthy reviews full of spoilers. I am and have always been an avid reader of novels. This little book took me to that magical place a good read has always taken me to and left me feeling a little empty for it being over and fulfilled for what it gave me. Four stars for a thoroughly enjoyable read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have played this game and reset it four times now. I LOVE this game. Even on the fourth go round I kinda remember the puzzles but certainly can't memorize them all. Worth the download.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|Nice characters but poor storyline and ending!!  A teen may enjoy the movie better who likes teen romance and fantasy.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love the fast pace. It is a good brain work out. Would recommend it for everyone to jumpstart your brain!
B0076DELIG|4.0|I love this series of books and I wasn't disappointed this time either. This book kept me wanting to turn the page.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|After reading The Lion, was told that The Panther was also a good book to pick up. A little more playful then Lion, it was also hard to put down wanting to find out what was going to happen.
0449011917|4.0|Enjoyed #4 way better than #3! Good progress of the characters and ending on a cliffhanger. Can't wait to find out what happens to our ugly-spirited queen and sad Sam!!<br /><br />Borrowed from the library as an audiobook.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|The Jack Reacher books are some of the best books to read if you like fast,fun,exciting,action thrillers. I find that after reading any one book that I have to buy the next one. So far I have just read # 10, and # 11 is already in my kindle.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|A great book for both men and women to allow for observations, studies, and stories of how women are given the up hill battle to do it all, and given permission to stop.
0451418441|5.0|This is a wonderful book and a worthy sequel to &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34;  sadly the &#34;made for TV&#34; series corrupted the story and spoiled the historic significance.  Read and enjoy this great book AVOID the movie.
1781162646|4.0|Looking for horror? Look elsewhere. Joyland is more of a coming-of-age story with a sprinkle of Hardy Boys. Devin Jones starts off the typical college student looking for work and fun. But as the story goes along he becomes both a man and a humanitarian. All the while evil lurks about. I was satisfied with the climax and felt bittersweet by the end. This was my first, not my last, Stephen King novel. I do realize long time King fans have a problem with this book. Thankfully I listened to an NPR interview he did. I understood what he was going for. Joyland is not a five star sit-down restaurant, it's a tasty food truck off the beaten path.
B005LAIH2M|3.0|It's obvious that Jeremy Renner struck when the iron was hot; this odd little movie is cute and fun but don't expect any depth from either the acting or the storyline. It's action-adventure and nothing but.
0679805273|5.0|I love this book! It makes a great graduation gift. I consider it my bible when I am feeling down and don't where life will take me...
B003G4W49C|2.0|I have heard about Ender's Game for years, and finally sat down to read it one night.<br />I was completely caught up in the author's world, utterly taken in. It's beautifully written, pacing is perfect, characters engaging and interesting . . . and then there came the end. It took me completely by surprise. I can't say more without giving away the ending, which I won't do. I'm aware that the series has continued, but I won't be reading further.
0307352153|5.0|Wonderful book. Insightful for the introvert or the friend of an introvert. I learned so much about myself. I highly recommend it!
B0054PSY2W|5.0|O Brother, Where Art Thou?<br />106 min<br />Comedy/Adventure/Crime<br />December 22, 2000<br />USA<br />Director: Joel Coen<br />Writers: Based on Homer's Odyssey, Ethan Coen<br />Stars: George Clooney, John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson, John Goodman<br /><br />I have followed the Cohen's since \\"Raising Arizona\\" another dark comedy that was well done, but not quite at this level.  This is a rich movie on several levels.  The story is great, and the casting, acting, and directing are excellent. The camera work is amazing, and the sets and scenery are outstanding.  The visuals and music incredible and they make us feel we are truly there.  Although film is considered an Art, it usually isn't up to the task of being art.  This film is truly art.  It is difficult to find a movie that is firing on all cylinders of all those individual crafts that make up a movie.  This movie will transport you to the Depression era and tell you a story of a small time crook that gets caught up in the politics of the time and receives his final salvation to return home from singing ole timey music.  I may have not been alive at that time, but I have seen enough films and heard enough stories from my father, grandmother, and others to have a good idea what it was like.  I wish my dad had been alive to see this movie, I think he would have enjoyed it.<br /><br />Recommendations: [[ASIN:B001EBWIPY The Green Mile]], [[ASIN:B001EBV0OY The Shawshank Redemption]], [[ASIN:B000VHTTKY It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]<br /><br />CA Luster
B003YL4LYI|5.0|George Martin please finish, these books are amazing! If you haven't read them buy the first one immediately.<br /><br />That is all.

A nice addition to the fairytale genre.  Take a true life character then put a myth around him that vampires are real and living in the United States and you have an interesting premise for a story.

B0084670FU|5.0|a very well directed film with the best acting of Brad Pitt's career. The movie chronicles the consequences of individual decisions and their impact to humanity at large. I watched this film twice and found even more compelling the second time.
B004XVN1T4|5.0|Another Ken Follett successful suspense.  He's one of those novelists that can just pull you into the story and keep you focused for hours on end.  Ken Follett can really help you visualize the places where the stories take place and make the characters come to life.  I can't wait for his next book!  I think I've read all of Ken Follet's books now!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great book better than the movie but wished the movie glowed the book more accurately.  Overall a great read especially for anyone suffering from depression or another mental health problem.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|Love him and wish others had the drive to put out great albums like this instead of just covering music like so many do now.
B001AFF25W|5.0|It sounds so much easier to eat a frog than an elephant.  And the way to do it right makes so much sense. I completely agree with the insight.
0071766588|4.0|Good Explanation of the exam sections in this book but found the available exams in this book  easier than the real exam.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|King Arthur was hurt a little more than I expected he would when he found Merlin to be sorcerer. The actor playing, Arthur did<br />a very good job in the way he treated his Knight's and servant's.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Simple story line, really good acting. Good vs the Bad guy. Yes, Good always wins in this movie. Watched it multiple times, good clean family movie. Great CGI effects. Giants  really looked Giants. highly recommend. Amazon Digital instant video is my prefered go to movie watching. venue.
B00AF7Z44K|4.0|The story of Merlin's life was done very well with excellent actors. They all played there played their parts very well and<br />it looked like they worked together excellently.
B001MTENOC|5.0|Makes sense in a world filled with religious nonsense. Thought provoking  read.  I appreciate all the research and the view into what happens next.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I Think Sylvia is a wonderful writer. I don't care if it would end up to being  10 books series. I would much rather see her books made into a movie, then Fifty Shades Of Grey.How long have we been waiting for E.L. James next or even the movie.......
B000JZ68GG|2.0|I would give this movie one star but, Jane Fonda is in it. So maybe 2 stars.<br />Movie is interesting only in context with that time period.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|Love this flick.  It's action with a certain amount of sass.  Besides Rosamond Pike is beautiful.  More than a few plot twists, keep you from taking your eyes off the screen.
8866131385|5.0|This planner looks professional, I have gotten many compliments and it has plenty of room to write notes and lists.
0375830995|4.0|I couldn't help but to feel for all of the characters in this novel. Such a simple read yet has powerful meanings with each card the main character obtains. However, the ending left me unsatisfied. It's a good, quick read nonetheless.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is great. My kids love it.... both of them enjoy making their own family's. It is a family-friendly game recommend for all.
0385738781|2.0|After reading all of the books in the Maze Runner Trilogy including the prequel, it had a lot of potential but too many similar concepts.<br /><br />In addition, the main character had trouble with \\"killing\\" people even as he was being slashed/attacked in various ways.<br /><br />Really?  I thought that Thomas was supposed to be a survivor and be in survivor mode.  Any hesitation should have knocked him out of any survival competition.<br /><br />Maze Runner series Prequel, book 1,book 2 and book 3 are quite similar to each other.  If you have read 1 book, you've pretty much read them all because it was more of the same slice/dice/dead/escaping, hesitating to kill, and then repeat all of that some more.<br /><br />I was hoping the last book of the series would explain more of the unanswered questions in the rest of the books.  But nope.  The author invents some impractical answers that the readers are supposed to swallow, since this story occurs in the future, and then creates an ending that should have been the obvious choice from the beginning.  Very let down.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I love how this movie has a Anime Style feel to the movie and shifting it to a WW type of scene then a Dragons Castle, while not steering of course of how this is an action movie. At first the movie is confusing, but afterwards you start to understand and the shifting of the action from different time periods of 3 cultures is very creative. Its like watching a Live Game.

B000QCS8TW|4.0|Exciting and well written. George Martin breathes life into his characters, and he does not play favorites with them. Therefore, you never know what to expect.
B006ATJXQW|2.0|The Prequel started out well with interesting concepts.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I agree that this Prequel didn't really expand any explanations to the rest of the Maze Runner Trilogy books.<br /><br />In addition, none of the characters in this book made it into the Maze Runner Trilogy.<br /><br />Too bad, it could have been a great series
1619695944|4.0|The Casual Vacancy is a bit slow at the beginning as we learn the main characters of the book.  Sadly many of these people are unhappy with their lives and it is like a Dursley neighborhood from Harry Potter. It is painfully descriptive and tragic especially as people ignore the obvious in front of them.  It was very well written but I would rather read more fantasy than reality from Ms. Rowling.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|Kids love this movie. Great fx and killer soundtrack. Glad we added to the Classic Tron movie. Jeff Bridges is the man.
B0031R5K68|2.0|Sorry, but it was too verbose for me.  I tended to skip pages because they seemed too wordy.  If I was confused, I would always come back.  Sorry, but this book was boring.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|this game is great and game play is great..would love to see some air to ground missions..will surely tell about this to friends
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great suspense.  Addresses issues of trust, integrity, denial, social stigmas and how the love of a parent for a child can blind them and affect their ability to reason and respond appropriately.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is the best game ever. I don't know what to say because it is so awesome.<br />I suggest anyone who thinks this game is a waste of time ......  wrong. It's addicting, yes but it's soooo fun.<br />I think everyone should have this game!!
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|Although this is a very action packed movie with some great car chase and action scenes, it falls far short of the quality of the first 2 die hard movies do to the fact that some aspects of the plot and movie are highly unbelievable, not to mention the un-original storyline. A little disappointed
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|The book is so suspenseful and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It is enlightening and brings a new perspective to the masons, DC, and science. This was a great read and I would suggest this as a read to anyone w h o loves a great story.
B008383GE8|3.0|Not being a scientist, I think I would have to read this book a number of times to come to some real understanding of many points. And, anyway, even then, that may well not occur. As to religious belief, there is the apparent fact of Jesus and his story. Also Mohammed, and indeed others. I am happy to continue to believe in Jesus, and, through him, God.
1451627289|3.0|Stephen King can write wonderful novels like, &#34; The Shawshank Redemption&#34;. But mostly he writes very mediocre books. This novel has an interesting concept. It is to go back in time and change history so President Kennedy lives because the narrator kills Lee Harvey Oswald. It is a hefty book so I am about half way through. It is okay. But I wouldn't recommend it unless you are a Stephen King fan. In my town we have small wooden kiosks all over my city. You can take a book to read or put in a book you have already read in, I will be putting this book in the kiosk as soon as I finish.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|So good.  I watched it twice during the 3 day rental period  and it choked me up both even though I knew how it would play out the second time!  Will probably purchase outright in the near future.
B003Y74AZ2|1.0|Cheap product for the money! Not worth $10<br />I advise you not to buy!<br />I want my money back but that's even a problem through amazon
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|One of the best fantasy books I've read this year. Very good characterization and world building. I'm usually not a big fan of jumping back and forth between alternate timelines - but this book is an exception. The author manages to use different timelines to create suspense (especially towards the end) without causing unnecessary confusion. Can't wait for the next book in the series.
B000P0J09W|5.0|Great purchase.  Thank you very much I recommend it.  It was from childhood.  Great memories.  I appreciate it very much.

1623420148|5.0|This novel was one that actually made me laugh out loud.  Something that doesn't happen often for me with romance novels.  It made you see a guys point of view and thought process of a relationship.  Really great book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great and HIGHLY ADDICTIVE. I cant say anything bad about it apart from the characters are quite expensive.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great and easy leisure read, couldn't put it down! Its a mystery book, do not judge it by the synopsis!

B003WUYRGI|5.0|I'm going to go with 5 stars my cause the most is everything from the beginning to the end. I didn't dislike a thing. And for<br />who doesn't like it ********
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works wonderfully!! Very impressed with the product. For all of us who remember pencils, this is great!  As hightech as you need
B007QUUJMG|1.0|The entire book was written in notes to a 'friend'. I personally found that very confusing to follow and a strange way to write a book. It just didn't appeal to me
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a fun game for kids and teenagers like myself .... and  I love despicable me it's the best movie ...
B0031KE9C6|5.0|I'm so excited a movie is being made. The show was canceled years ago. It never had a proper finale. It's funny, great writing, mysteries are cool. The LoVe story is epic!
B009RH9FR6|4.0|Goods:  I really think this is leather, it came with that wonderful leather smell.  It feels good and is classy.  it is well padded.  My Kindle did fall out when I first installed, so make sure EVERY INCH clicks into place.  The Kindle actually stands up in portrait mode!  My last stand promised this but didn't deliver.  Several good viewing angles in landscape mode.  It rotates all the way around, so you can put the ports on the outside and charge with cover closed.  I don't really use that hand strap thing inside the cover, but it's not a hindrance when I'm holding the Kindle. Mostly I love that it's pretty.<br /><br />Bad: It is REALLY hard to rotate.  Maybe it would loosen up and be easier if I rotated it more, but that's a lot of effort.  I usually keep it rotated so the charging ports are on the outside.  I think that may be the cause of the only other problem I have.  The cover doesn't always put the Kindle to sleep or wake it like it's supposed to.  So I found myself straining to see if the light was still on while the cover's closed.  Now, I generally just manually put the Kindle to sleep, just in case.  It works better when the ports face the spine, but then I can't charge with the cover close, so I sacrifice the convenience of the sleep/awake (you still have to swipe to unlock anyway).  Overall, not a big issue for me, but could be for others.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Judy Dench and Maggie Smith at their very best. Dev Patel as the ambitious young hotel owner.  A star studded cast, and they deliver.<br /><br />Seven elderly Britishers, facing difficulties adjusting to retirement at home, decide to start a new life at a most wonderful hotel for senior citizens, located in Jaipur, India. The hotel is old and unusual by western standards.  Most of the room don't even have doors and the food is too spicy. The new guests have difficulties adjusting to their environment, but each copes in his or her own way.  Evelyn must take a job at a call center that caters to English businesses; Jean and Doug quarrel, Jean staying in the hotel and Doug exploring the sights of Jaipur; Graham has come to find the Indian boy who was his lover when they were in school together; Muriel overcomes her racism and becomes friends with her doctor and the hotel maid; Madge looks for a rich husband by trying to pass as Princess Margaret; Norman, trying to pick up well-to-do women, finds himself being introduced to 'Princess margaret.\\"  And the irrepressible Sunny attempts to save his hotel from his greedy brothers, who want to tear it down, and his love for a local girl from his mother, who wants an arranged marriage.<br /><br />The manner in which the characters explore their own lives while interacting with the others weaves a heartwarming tale of life and love, joy and despair.  They each struggle to find answers, and in the end they succeed.<br /><br />This is a movie that I will remember forever!
B009UNH0EM|5.0|Delivered as promised. Simple packing. Original plantronics charger cable. This is the same as the cable that comes with the original headset.
B00A8MGIZG|1.0|A complete and total waste of time and money. A hop scotch of fast forward, jump back baloney. I should have payed more attention to the other 1 star reviews.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I loved purchasing a season pass.  I don't have to worry about my DVR acting up and not recording and I don't have to watch commercials.  The video quality is very good and I am very pleased with my purchase.
B0083GQVOC|4.0|This is a \\"Thinking Person's Movie\\". It is not an easy movie to watch. My wife and I talked about this movie for two days.<br /><br />As you are watching it, you will probably find yourself frustrated, which I believe is part of the director's construct to make you have an almost visceral sense of the main character's (Eva) frustration. Then as the story unfolds, and your understanding of what is happening or has happened increases, your frustration turns to anger and fear, and finally to sympathy and empathy for Eva and even Kevin. You will be left with an epiphany or reinforcement of the fact that there are no easy answers because we don't even know all the questions.<br /><br />Btw, I only gave it four stars because it just seems inappropriate to say that \\"I love it.\\" My wife and I absolutely appreciate all the craftsmanship which is evident in the movie from the writing, the directing, the acting, the editing, all of it, but it just seems wrong to say \\"I love it\\". If five stars can mean POWERFUL, then it is five stars.
B008FRJ1IW|5.0|Great item, as described. easy to put together. A well made product, would buy other products that are made by Lego.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|This series was recommended to me by a good friend.  I purchased season 2 to check it out.  I was not disappointed.  Can not wait until amazon has season 3.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Awesome.  I don't know what else to say.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and could not put it down.  From the Daily Practice to this latest installment in the Life and Times of James Altucher he continues to provide valuable lessons through his sometimes &#34;hard to watch&#34; life experience.  He shows all the ugly inner workings of his life and mind, the same kind we all have, but he is brave enough to put his out there for everyone to see.  Thank you James for continuing to share these lessons.
B008Y589VU|5.0|I have watched this movie several times since my purchase.  Rachel Weisz was magnificent and so were the other cast members.  I have recommended it to all my family and friends as a must watch movie.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Addicting.  Love it. Very challenging.  I downloaded yesterday a/nd I just can't  stop playing the game definitely a must have download
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|It was a good series.  The storyline was great as well as the depiction of the dark ages.  Acting could have been a bit better.  I recommended it to my family and friends.
B005K17RU0|3.0|my Kindle Fire just updated this app. I prefer the original radar map for ease of access, the ability to zoom to street level and the ability to scroll to different areas within the US.
1479374121|1.0|This review is not about the work of literature by Fitzgerald, but about this particular printing. I'm not sure if this book is public domain or what, but this print is below amateur. There is no semblance of margin, spacing, or format. Paragraphs run to the very top of the page, there are NO page numbers, the table of contents is printed on the left before chapter one, and the title page shows other titles printed by this publisher, which just happen to be explicit, adult coloring books. This is the least classy publication I can possibly imagine for what should be a classic book. This looks like it was made in someone's dorm room.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and order a more trusted version of this, from a well-known publisher. The pricing is not very different, and if you care about the aesthetics or practicality of your books, you will NOT want this version.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app is great!  Was having trouble downloading to android tablet because I don't use the kindle as much.  Love it!
B00006GA4C|5.0|Your music collection is not complete without this album.You have got to buy this one! You will not be Sorry!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|pretty cool app. definitely keeps your mind working<br />like to play it before bed. level 8 threw me for a loop but I eventually worked it out.
0307891372|4.0|Wonderful guide. Very handy for playing the game. Has almost everything that you could want for Skyrim, which has a ton of content.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|Cooking Dash is great,but it has a lot of pop-up ads for diner dash, and you still have to pay to unlock every restaurant. Other than that, the game itself is pretty good.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|This app is beautiful. You ONLY HAVE to drag your finger around to make the most beautiful picture you've ever seen. P.S. If there was 10 stars avalible I would give it 10!!!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This is by far the best CPU compound in the market. This tube has enough to do at least 3-5 applications on a CPU. I have used Artic Silver on multiple builds and it never leaves me dissatisfied.<br /><br />If your considering the &#34;best&#34; compound for your motherboard and CPU look no further.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|The prequel. I thought it was good and I enjoyed the 3d a lot so did our 5 year old grandson
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|This book was so compelling I could hardly set it down.  A beautifully written book, truly sad that its over!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I absoultly love this game its awesome!  its so much fun and great for kids! It takes a little while to get the hang of it but its awesome!
B00AAI7B7W|3.0|I had high hopes for the movie but it turns out the movie wasn't all that. First the scary part starts too late, then the movie wasn't all that anyways.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I like these kind of movies...it's always good to have hero's at work and making things better in the world!
1781162646|5.0|Reminiscent of some of King's short stories from Different Seasons especially The Body. Sentimental and moving at times this book ranks up there for me along side What Dies in Summer by Tom Wright. Both books provide some suspense while also providing good character development.
B003HV0TN2|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Fantastic characters. I didn't want to put it down. Can't wait to buy the next one.
B005544V6A|5.0|This is a refreshing show! I enjoy the eye candy of Mike Ross.
B008OOYALE|2.0|I am so upset at the update for the kindle. Now it cost more in food to level up my dragons. Actually double to be exact. Why did they do that!?
B00CRS5HII|5.0|Great album.  True Darius Rucker music.  Saw this reviewed on Country Music Channel and had to get my own copy.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|this thing froze all day long. I had an excellent connection, this product slowed everything down.  I would not waste my time with it.  sorry...sounds so negative
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm thinking this is my favorite now in the series...I'm dying to know what happens with all the loose ends and I hope the next one doesn't take as  long to come out! Definitely recommend this one!
B00CB4ET0K|1.0|tried multiple times to get this to download on my larger kindle fire...no deal, I had to delete the avatar/icon for it as it was a waste
B005K17RU0|4.0|Love this app. It really helps us plan our days. It's usually pretty accurate, well as acurate as predicting the weather can be :).  Also the severe weather warnings are nice to have pop up. You can track weather in several places as well.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|loved this movie; a little better that what we normally get from Sparks (as in, they all don't HAVE to die in the end of EVERY movie he writes/book he writes.....<br />The best part of this is my ability to use prime to order for cheap/free...this is awesome.
B0034G4P26|5.0|Somehow I missed this when it came out, but it is a hoot.  Kids love it and get some historical facts too!  Grandkids all love it!
B00CGPPMKU|3.0|I would love to give it a five star rating but I can't get the save to work most of the time.
1451695195|5.0|This book is a must read for everyone, especially if you have lost a loved one or if there is any doubt there is a heaven. Finally, it has been proven not only from a faith based viewpoint, but from a scientific study of the brain and how it works that  there is truly a heaven. Dr. Alexander's book explains this is such detail that I never could have imagined. I have read several books on death, dying and the hereafter, but none of them can compare to Dr. Alexander's experience and ultimate book.  Thank you, Dr. Alexander, for this very compassionate and educational work.
B006TKP2B2|4.0|Creative and inspiring novel, with lots of clever ideas about the future. As a traveler there, I enjoyed the Thai color. The sexuality of windup girl is problematic. Not sorry I read, would read again
B009NY43NY|4.0|I was disappointed with this book.  I was good.... but after my true devotion to the 13 book series I feel I deserved a better ending.  I more firm and stable ending for each character...not wishy washy maybe's.  Probably why Charlaine Harris is writing a follow up to the characters due out in October 2013.  I was not the only disappointed person!
B0026KX5PO|5.0|I watched this movie again on a weekend when I needed to see some scary, creepy movies! (yea I know) I love this movie because it always manages to creep me out.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Eva and Gideon get closer--not just physically!  But was disappointed that it was not the end....to be continued to a fourth book.....
B0018M6J90|5.0|I saw this movie on TV and loved it.  Frances McDormand is a wonderful actress. I also loved the costuming and especially the music. I recommend it to those who loves funny, charming characters and a fast moving plot.  It does have some nudity in the beginning but it is not tasteless. I suppose the thing I liked best is the storyline and how well it was acted.  There are very few I want to watch over and over, this in one of them.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Why did I wait so long to see this movie? This was a fantastic movie, it was shot, written, and acted perfectly. It was incredibly suspenseful without being a &#34;shoot 'em up&#34; action movie. You feel like your the characters trapped in Iran during the entire film. Must see!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I had heard of this wonderful series and did a DA marathon season 1,2 and 3❗ did not disappoint. Characters are well developed and consistent. Historical references are correct as are the costumes and dialect of that time. Simply wonderful! Can't wait for the next season to start🎩
6305320802|5.0|I love all of the old musicals. The quality of the product was outstanding. My husband and I have enjoyed watching this musical.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I already loved this world and the story of America, but now I really see the secondary characters for who they are. In this book you really get to know Maxon and understand him better. You really feel for him while he tries to build a future around such a recklace and volatile individual, like America. This story has the perfect amount of action, mystery, and intrigue. I can't wait to read the conclusion!
B00ACP3OOM|4.0|I do a lot of swimming, at least three times a week and spend one to two hours at the pool and it can get a bit monotonous, so I have had a waterproof MP3 before and it was a bit lack lustre; this was because of the ear phones which did not always work whilst under water. If you are the type of person who swims with their head out of the water then the ear phone type will probably be better for you rather than this `Finis Neptune MP3'. This has head phones that are like sound pads that you attach to your goggles and they play through your cheekbone straight into your inner ear.<br /><br />The MP3 part attaches to the back strap of your goggles and can be easily operated once you get the hang of it. There is also a play/pause button on the left ear piece which is more accessible. It is pretty lightweight too so there are no adverse effects to your swimming. The sound does vary and that is down to how you swim. If both ears are under water you get a very good sound reproduction, but not comparable to dry air quality. If you are say, doing front crawl then by necessity your head is going from side to side and this causes fluctuations in the sound. The best way to get around this is to wear ear plugs; this then means that you are getting uniformity of sound to both ears all the time. I find using the gel ones that mould to your ear the best as they are waterproof and re usable.<br /><br />It holds its charge really well too but I did find when I first used them that I had put it on full volume and it could have still been louder. I adjusted the position to be around my jawbone axis and it was a lot better, also the addition of ear plugs made a marked improvement. It has a 4GB memory which is around 1000 songs unless you are into prog rock where you might get 3 albums on - only kidding. For me this means not having very much on it as I love music and buy loads. This means that adding and deleting needs to be easy. The instructions regarding downloading and synching are very straight forward and actually quite comprehensive. I did have an initial problem so phoned the European helpline number and it did not work, I tried 4 times. I eventually worked out where I was going wrong, but I was a bit miffed that the number did not respond. There is a US `toll free' number also which I did not try.<br /><br />One small point is that you can not remove the ear phones and put in ear plugs to use normally as one friend asked as that would affect the waterproof integrity of the device. All in all it is a great little MP3 and makes it a lot easier to swim for longer as I have found out, but you do get a few people asking `what is that on your head?' So it's a good way to meet strangers too and I look forward to a lot more use.ery straight forward and actually quite comprehensive.

B0073LWEXK|4.0|Wonderful game for the price with interesting puzzles. Not many of this quality for the kindle and am waiting for their next one
B008FSCNTK|2.0|If someone is going to undertake a quasi-history project for public consumption, the redux ought to be performed better than the original, or bring something new to the table. I don't find either of those in this album. The people originally responsible for this type of music were the musical innovators of their day, and it was the vehicle for their life force and pathos. I don't pick up those currents (or undercurrents) in this recording. Which leaves the \\"bringing something new\\" part. The singer has simply superimposed her smooth style onto that of a different time and place. In another situation, that may have been brilliant... a transcendent synergy. Just didn't happen here. Diana Krall can do some things KILLER well, as good as you'll ever find. Of course artists can and should branch out.  I'm not criticizing that idea.  I don't know who was most responsible for the essence of this album, but I think they should have found the missing ingredient before releasing it. Regardless, Diana Krall is still way up on the top shelf!<br />P.S. the Amazon editorial review is simply  bald faced propaganda. They should be ashamed of themselves.
B000VZSOI4|5.0|This book is very useful for those who wants to start playing real jazz repertoire.<br />I was really surprised by the number of songs from my country, Brazil.<br />I really loved it and would recommend for everyone.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I admit it. I was one of those people that gave up on the game the first time. I didn't really understand it. After trying it a second time I'm totally hooked. Give it a chance. Best 99&cent; I've spent on my kindle so far. It's especially satisfying to name a world ending virus after your old lady haha
B005HI4LMS|5.0|This is made of very good quality products. I'ts better than I even expected I'm very please with it and will probably purchase more than one<br />A++++
B00846REIS|1.0|I don't think I can continue this series, I just did not like the leading lady, Eva.<br /><br />1. Who leaves the office at 5PM in NYC - unmarried/no kids?<br />2. Eva loves sex, but was sexually abused.  I couldn't reconcile that fact while reading this.<br />3. The author lost me when Eva said, &#34;Just do me&#34; who says that?<br />4. Eva is into hardcore gym time, but only runs on the treadmill for 20 minutes.  And - why is that even in the book - running for 20 minutes.<br /><br />I had almost zero emotional connection to these characters, so when they hit the emotional peak of Gideon almost raping Eva - it didn't resonate with me, and I just skipped through to see what happened next.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The room will totally be a game you enjoy if you want a legit puzzle mystery game. It's good to see that at least one company can invest the time, energy, and creativity to create a great game of depth and mystery. Great job fire proof games keep it up!
B008KMHFJY|5.0|Loved it I hope that there will be more to come in this series - it's great and I couldn't put it down
B008MEM24S|4.0|This is a great game for kids and adults, in this game there are levels that causes thinking to get water and fill it up and help Perry
076781326X|5.0|Simply beautiful and truly a work of art.  Classic moving making at its best.  Entire cast with Ron Moody is stellar.
0763644765|5.0|My son loves this book!  Unfortunately it hasn't really helped him go potty, but he does love to read it, and gets very excited when the boy ends up going potty at the end.  (woops, spoiler! :)
1451695195|5.0|Eben Alexander's experience is unique in all the NDE literature I've come across over the years.  Read it for yourself and come to your own conclusions.  I found it intense and uplifting, a very positive spiritual confirmation of what I believe exists beyond that final door.
B002ZG99TA|1.0|This is a personal quirk of mine but if a cinematic technique is used repeatedly to the point of annoyance, it dilutes the enjoyment factor.<br /><br />The first technique is color filter overuse, which I first noticed in Man On Fire and had that same yellowish tint.  This can be overlooked and just accepted. What made this movie totally annoying to the point of anger was that every shot during the action sequences was handheld and all over the place.  A car gets crashed into and it's hard to see because the camera is purposely shakey (to make things look raw and real, perhaps?).  But even that I've seen in other movies before.<br /><br />But what I found particularly aggravating was that almost every other shot, no matter what the duration, had an unnecessary quick zoom in or quick zoom out or both.  It became such a distraction and annoyance that it took me totally out of the movie to the point where I was verbally tallying each one.  I'd seen quick zooms in the Death Race and Get Carter remakes (on the drivers in the cars) that looked ridiculous. In Unstoppable, it was all over the place.  If there was a reason for it, that's something else entirely.  But in this movie, there were zooms for absolutely no reason other than the director and director of photography wanted to establish a look and a feel.  To this particular viewer, that feeling was annoyance and anger.<br /><br />Anyway, I found the technique so distracting that it killed any enjoyment.  Minus these techniques, I would probably give this movie three stars because it is a decent action movie if one doesn't dissect implausabilities in the plot.  Movies featuring juggernauts are always impressive.<br /><br />But to those who think I'm off the mark, the next time you watch Unstoppable, verbally mark each time there is a short zoom in/out and I guarantee you will be surprised how many there are.  Obviously those who didn't notice had gotten so caught up in the story.  I guarantee that once you consciouslycall out the first three examples (which could well be seen in a span of ten seconds or less), you'll notice its abuse throughout the movie.
147674355X|5.0|Read this on lend - having to go a little on memory here, so forgive any mistakes.<br /><br />Short Review: I really liked the mystery plot behind this one. It was nice to get a different kind of story than just a boy meets girl, cue inevitable and predictable ending. And the ending wasn't predictable. The love story portion was sweet, if a smidge over the top and unrealistic, but that's what some people want out of a romance novel. Still, definitely worth a read. Be prepared, however, for a young story. This is a New Adult Romance. The characters are in high school. My main criticism is that this book really should have had older protagonists. I felt a bit dirty reading this about teenagers.<br /><br />Long Review:<br />The most important points are covered above. It was really nice to see a strong mystery bringing the protagonists together. And the story was sweet. I really enjoyed following these two on their journey to find the truth as they were getting to know one another.<br /><br />There are some criticisms to be made of Ms. Hoover's writing. The writing itself is sophomoric, but she is a relatively fresh author and she is writing in the New Adult Romance genre, so it isn't entirely unexpected. I am a little disappointed, however, that this book is written in the NA Romance genre. This would have been a great one for, say, protagonists meeting in grad school or early in their careers. Maybe they met at a therapy group. IDK, I'm just throwing out ideas. I think the romance aspect could have been more passionate. Like I said above, I felt a little dirty reading this about teenagers, and the book isn't just one meant for teenagers to read.<br /><br />Some of the plot points wouldn't have worked in a story with older protagnists. However, some of the plot points had serious holes in them, anyway. These holes were hard for me to look past as they went a bit beyond suspending my personal knowledge for the sake of a book and getting on the Fun Train. The need for abirth certificate and social security card, for example. How did Sky get an ID/license or into school without one? It's asking me to accept too much.<br /><br />And then the push and pull between the protagonists. I wish these types of novels were just a bit more real about the male and female being equally as upset by the other being a jerk or stubborn. I understand that these novels are written for young women, and so the male should be a Prince Charming and stick by her, but he should have a more realistic reaction to at least some of her bitchiness. Really.<br /><br />One other minor thing: &#34;Lesslie?&#34; I know you had to do it, but really?<br /><br />Still, in the end, it was sweet and a really nice job of working the romance into a true mystery. I enjoyed it, even with its shortcomings. As long as you are prepared for a young story, you should enjoy this. Nicely done Ms. Hoover.
0425263924|5.0|These 3 books are very interesting, I couldn't put any of them down.  There is plenty of sex scenes, seems they just don't run out of stamina.  The end of this book is just that, the end of the book, not the story, just leaves you asking questions knowing that there has to be another one.  If you like the 50 books you will like this also.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I had to wait a few days to read this after I purchased it because I've learned that Rollins doesn't give readers much time to come up for air during his books.<br />There are no good stopping places in Rollins' books- just nonstop action and a torrential flood of interesting information.<br />My only stopping points are when I head to Google to look things up. I'm a little embarrassed to admit that this happened a lot in his latest book.<br />I love the characters. I love the science. I even love the far-fetched theoretical and even supernatural aspects that some others seem uncomfortable with.<br /><br />Excellent installment. Highly recommend!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a great game. It is very addicting and hard to stop playing after you start. The game gets you thinking and is not too challenging.
1250007208|5.0|There is really nothing I can say that can express my love of Cinder. So many feels, not enough words. I recommend this book to everyone! It's a book that transcends all genres. It's got romance, science fiction, dystopian, fantasy, and the fairy-tale storyline (which it isn't defined by; Marissa Meyer takes a lot of great liberties with the original fairytale and just blows me away with her interpretation). You are deluding yourself if you think you won't enjoy this one.<br /><br />Cinder is extremely likeable. Her attitude towards the world is snarky, humourous, and thoughtful as she navigates judgements from her peers for being a cyborg, while questioning her past and her place in Kai's life. She's entirely believable, and sometimes I just want to shout at her through the pages to stop being so silly and admit she loves Kai! Grrr!! Her indecisiveness is totally reasonable, but as a reader you get so frustrated because all this bad stuff is happening to her and you just want the one good thing to actually, you know, work itself out?<br /><br />I love love love Cinder's android-friend Iko. She's definitely the comic relief, but she is adorable and hilarious. I want one. She's pretty much the voice of the reader as she voices her thoughts when it comes to what Cinder is dealing with. I love her quirky personality.<br /><br />Prince Kai...he's such an adolescent boy. He's good natured, nice, if a little pushy around Cinder sometimes, but then again, all characters need their faults to be realistic. I love his POV, especially when dealing with Queen Levana (shudder), the Lunar ruler who sets everyone's teeth on edge.<br /><br />At first when the book talked about the moon colonies I was like...ok, not sure if this is going to work. Is this just in the plot to make it more sci-fi? But then I started to see the connections...Queen Levana's stepdaughter Winter (Snow White anyone?) is mentioned, and Levana is obsessed with her beauty, which she creates with her Glamour, aLunar ability that allows the Lunar person to control the bioelectricity in other people to manipulate their thoughts.<br /><br />Over the course of the book there are more hints...Wing Commander Michelle Benoit is mentioned, who is Scarlet Benoit's grandmother in the next book. Winter is mentioned as well, and Cress (third book) makes an appearance near the end of the book (I won't give anything else away). I'm just so incredibly excited to see how Marissa Meyer ties everything together when she finishes up the series.<br /><br />The ending will probably kill you, just saying. I'm still trying to get over it, even after rereading it. Prepare to be frustrated, amazed, confused, just everything. Just read it. It's a stunning debut from Marissa Meyer.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Great movie for the whole family! Rented on Amazon instant video and the quality was great too!  Definitely recommend for movie night!

B000W7JWUA|5.0|From 8 to 38 everyone has a blast!  Only bummer is it really only a four player game, so being a family of 5, we have to team up.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love  this book!!! Have read it multiple times and is always.good! Would recommend this book to anyone who likes reading!
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading most of the reviews for this book I was worried that I would end up hating it and it would ruin the series for me. I ended up loving it. We see a whole other side of Katniss. She is someone everyone can relate too. A broken girl who is scared and wants to save her family, friends and the boy who saved her - Peeta. That was the other reason why I loved this book.<br />We get to see more of Peeta and how far he will go to save his one true love. It's amazing to read how much he loves Katniss. But the best thing about this book is it leads us into a different story then we thought. It's no longer a love story, but a war story.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It keeps you very entertained.  You don't want to stop playing until the rooms are solved. I can't wait until more rooms are added!
0609610570|4.0|Plenty of practical lessons and applications of leadership, organizational effectiveness and great management from proven expert leaders.

072325804X|5.0|I purchased this book for a friend to give to a young child and it is great that great books for children are still in print.<br />These are classic tales and great for young minds.<br />Jane Weston<br />gingerw2@comcast.net
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Not only did this movie contain plenty of action, dynamic special effects, and great acting, this movie has shown us what it takes for a starfleet crew to develop the characteristics necessary in order to become a crew ready to go on a five year mission into outer space.  This is something that has been missing in the 29 years of TV Star Trek and in the preceeding 11 movies.<br />  I love this movie and as a Star Trek fan, I place it as one of the best Star Trek movies.  Thank you J. J. and crew, thank you to the writers, thank you to the excellent cast, thank you to all of the special effects crew, and to the various 100 or so other persons who worked to bring us a very special, complex Star Trek movie that really felt like Star Trek to me!!!  Barb M.<br />  And thank you to the cute Bad Robot in the grass!!
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|Worth a watch, but it's definitely your typical, predictable movie. Cool special effects though. Good for watching on a lazy Sunday. Robert Downey, Jr. is the best part about this movie.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|this is the best online multiplayer game ever.<br />these are reasons why<br />1: AWESOME GRAPHICS!<br />2: the best gameplay<br />3:so many players to play with<br />4: lots of characters<br />those are reasons why you should get it too

B00CWV8TIU|5.0|The ending was very surprising! And I like the fact that it kept me guessing the motive for getting the good doctor in trouble. Highly recommend it!
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Challenging game, makes you really think before placing the bubbles to shoot.  I enjoy games that make me think about my next move in order to preserve/limit my limit supply of bubbles to obtain the best score.
B005OP2928|5.0|Great writing, funny situations, great actors, good chemistry between actors, easy to follow, lots going on in every episode, I can watch it with kids without worrying about the impact. In other words, one of the best comedy shows currently on TV.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is an awesome game. i love that every month we get a new world. i also love that every week we get a weekly hunt. a weekly hunt is an item that we have to find so many times in a week we also get a prize when u complete the weekly hunt. i recomend this game for all ages.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Good movie even though I am not a fan of Kristen Stewart. Perhaps casting should have chosen a better actress for this role and would have made the chemistry between other actors more appealing. Great special effects!
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|kids this game is fun but u have to buy everything with real money. i think that this game is a scam to make u spend all of your money on your acount. dont waste your time and money on this game.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|In his novel, World War Z, author Max Brooks, created a telling of a zombie infested, post-apocalyptic world. Rather than a traditional narrative, Brooks told his tale as a collection of individual recollections of the ten-year war against zombies. When the film adaptation of the bestselling book was announced, I was excited to see the book brought to life, but wondered if such an adaptation was even possible. How could the filmmakers adapt a book with so many characters and such a large scope.<br /><br />The answer . . . they don't. Rather than attempt to chorale Brooks's writing into the constraints of a film, the filmmakers use little more than the title and the idea of a zombie apocalypse in this \\"adaptation\\". With Brad Pitt playing a former UN employee who is called to jump back into his old lifestyle for the sake of his family, the filmmakers wisely choose to focus on a central character and his struggle to survive. I guess when you have Brad Pitt starring in your movie, you better use him!<br /><br />The film opens as Pitt, accompanied by his wife(Mireille Enos), prepares to drive his daughters to school. On this drive, the family witnesses the zombie outbreak firsthand, narrowly escaping the danger of the streets. Desperate to safeguard his family from the attacks, he calls upon his old friend at the United Nations, and agrees to help search for the origin of the outbreak in exchange for his family's asylum. They are then flown to an ocean based command center, where Pitt learns of the apparent virus that causes people to turn to zombies. As the film progresses, we follow Pitt as he visits numerous places around the world, each affected by the outbreak.<br /><br />World War Z is directed by Marc Forester (Finding Neverland, Quantum of Solace), who brings a fast pace and edgy tone to the story. It is very difficult to make a zombie seem threatening. Indeed, there were moments in this film where the zombies are almost laughable. But the filmmakers, deftly find a way around that. By allowing the actors to play their characters straight and develop genuine emotional stakes, the threat of zombies becomes more urgent and threatening.<br /><br />Before its release, World War Z was mired in production setbacks that included a massive rewrite and reshoot of it's third act. The result is an ending that foregoes the normal summer blockbuster conclusion of intense action and special effects. Rather, the film ends with a intimate, suspense laden scene that intelligently concludes the movie, while artfully and organically leaving the possibility for a sequel. Despite a complete departure from the source material, World War Z manages to remain smart, intriguing, and most importantly, entertaining.a way around that.

B00BHMETKC|3.0|The religious and political history, valor, ingenuity, bravery, self-sacrifice are the gifts of this movie.  The actual movie (i.e., writing, directing, acting) is just another movie.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Almost like an action move.<br />liked the plot.<br />I would recommend this to anyone that remembers the child hood stories..
B00CFSWMYM|4.0|This is so far away from a sophomore slump, as some have suggested by a few reviewers here. The album represents a step forward for Austra, a solid one at that. It is diverse in its approach and its range, and it is often experimental in nature. I loved it at first listen, just like the first album, and I'll continue to listen to it regularly, just like the first album.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Kinda lost me somewhere in the middle...<br />The story was good but could of played some of the parts in a different place.<br />not enough suspense or action.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|It is Call of Duty for mobile device without having to pay 60 dollars. It is a musthave for paid apps.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This is my new favorite series to watch!! I'm so happy I bought all the series. Sit back and enjoy the show!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Lots of fun, however there is a learning curve involved .<br />It takes time to figure things out, but the hints help.
B00AZQGZVM|4.0|The only bad thing I can say of this plush is that it can't stand correctly, it always falls... The materials are perfect, it's almost flawless, I really love it! &#60;3
B005EGXNLS|4.0|I have really enjoyed this series, and Death of Kings is absolutely no exception! The way that Cornwell tells the story through the eyes of the old man Uhtred, while detailing the exploits of the younger Uhtred makes for a very compelling story landscape. This novel finally finds some satisfaction for Uhtred in terms of Alfred's generosity, but we still see that there is much, much more to be told in this story. Again, a fantastic read!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was a great game. I wish it had more levels though, but other wise it was fun too play.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I I I I I I llllllllove the game.it is the best when I say the best I mean the best.  I beat your be in love with it when you play it for 1 mins.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I think that this game needs more content . The first time I played it I couldn't figure out what to do to get to a competition , yet now I am no better at this game .I'm always trying to figure out how to this or how to do that . I am asking my sister all the time to help me do stuff . So I give this game 3 stars .
B008IGP8QE|5.0|My son loves the show & loves listening to the music...it's very upbeat & catchy. I find myself singing along too.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Super cute graphics, nice storyline, contains voice acting by actual show cast, and although most of the prices for ponies/items seem out of reach and impossible, just be patient an d the game will be a fun experience. This game is great for My Little Pony fans, and should not be played by the impatient or children who have access to their parent's credit cards. Overall, my most used app. Thank you.
B000002JBG|5.0|My son loves basketball & is a big fan of the movie....he listens to this soundtrack just about everyday. He gets to re-enact his favorite scenes through the great music on this CD.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|The best battery app I've found. Very handy, user-friendly, easy to use. Also has stats data, like graphs, so you can check the times, when you used your device and how this usage affected battery.
B001AYENBM|5.0|I love any Will Smith movie, but the original ending of this one left me empty.  This alternate ending is much more satisfying.  Hooray!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Very funny game.<br /><br />But first levels are very hard. Your car is very bad, you need to upgrade it. Take a time to finish first levels, get money for upgrades and the game will become very good time spending.
B0066WJLU6|2.0|No really very good on kindle with no led. The screen dos not provide much light, probably better on a smart phone
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Classic escape game. A must, if you played and enjoyed other game from this developers - \\"[[ASIN:B00CWY76CC Can You Escape]]\\".<br /><br />First level has a tutorial, which makes it easier, if you never played \\"Escape\\" games.
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|Love the fact  Bruce always comes out ahead!  Great action, great humanity story showing the love between estranged Father and Son
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Echoes of the classic puzzle game Myst. To bad this one is fairly short, still worth every penny. Looking forward to the next installment

Don't even think about it. Order it today, and you will have a nice summer CD, to play! Love You, Joe!!! Fan for life!
B00CFA227C|4.0|Yes my 10yr old kept predicting what was going to happen next.<br /><br />Yes he was right most of the time, but didn't know how it would be portrayed on the screen.<br /><br />Yes the script introduces elements and never revisits them (i.e. Jack finding the treasure horde)<br /><br />Yes the movie starts off interesting in the telling of the history. Much better than normal narration of what came before. Nearly as good as the Princess Bride and catching us up with the story of the characters in that movie.<br /><br />Yes Ewan McGregor is clearly a likeable character and he did well in the role.<br /><br />Yes Nicholas Hout was a good, believable Jack, who's courage outweighs his fears and ineptitude.<br /><br />No, I'm not sure if I liked Eleanor Tomlinson as Isabelle. I think she was cast alright, but they made a point in the movie how she's not so \\"fragile\\" and can handle adventure but other than wearing armor she needs Jack's protection throughout. Character was inconsistent.<br /><br />OVERALL: Good clean family fun. All the \\"killing\\" is pretty much off-screen though you know it happens. Kids liked it and our visiting international exchange student was able to follow along with subtitles (can read English better than speak or understand spoken) and so the movie was better than okay for us.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I was left wondering what will happen next! Great story as well as extremely steamy! Can't wait for the 4th book!
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I play this game nightly.  Perhaps it isn't the same as the version that will come on a computer but it is still fun to play and very entertaining.
B00BF11UM0|5.0|Really Keeps Your Interest In And Brings You In To The Intensity Of The Situation. Well Done.  Does An Excellent Job Of Holding Your Attention And  Not Letting The Movie Drag.
B005VPRET4|1.0|One can't expect a young child to put this together.  There must be 100-200 mostly small pieces.  Very disappointed with the purchase.
B000NTPDSW|3.0|Well, all three movies are here, but I can see little or no advantage to pay for Blu-ray technology. It added nothing to the enjoyment of the trilogy especially in the first movie. To paraphrase Clemenza, &#34;take the movie, leave the Blu-ray.&#34;
B002W7J3SO|5.0|This movie has a little bit of everything.  It moves along with great acting, interesting plot and wonderful scenery.<br />I would recommend this movie to others.
B0000067L3|4.0|If you love the short lived but always remembered Cream, here it is. People that really grew up in the rock and roll era know how good they were.  Time less music will never die.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|This movie was great staring Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman , veteran British actor Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth and the late Heath Ledger as the Joker .  In this second film in the Dark Knight Trilogy, by director David Goyer. Batman must save Gotham City , from the one and only Clown Prince of Crime's rampage across the city. This movie has great action and visuals ,and not to mention Batman gets a new tool to fight crime.  The weird yet totally awesome Batpod, a experimental combat motorcycle, in addition the Batmobile , Batsuit ,and Utility Belt full of gadgets.  However his detective and martial arts skills , were a bit underused, in this franchise. A problem that I hope they will rectify in  newer DC Comics /Warner Bros films.
B0000067L4|4.0|If you are really a fan of rock, then Cream has the music, and the background to make it great. The greastest gutiar player in history, who could even sing also, as he found out.
B00006SFLV|5.0|I bought this box set a while back for my sister's birthday, and she loves it . And it was at a great price too, which was awesome, this television series . Which introduced a nation of Generation X-ers , to a young actress Claire Danes . As a suburban teen dealing with the everyday problems of life . When your at that age , and dealing with everything from high school , friends ,parents, teachers, relatives, classwork, homework, teenage angst , hormones, bullies etc. Being a teen can be tough, and this series proves it. Clearly one of the best  teen dramas of the 90's, My So Called Life is definitely welcome in my sister's dvd collection!!!
B003QO8TDC|5.0|I saw the movie years ago. i'm still thrilled by the songs, music and dancin. The plot has merit too.<br />Thanks for makind this dvd available. Louis.
B00821OX98|5.0|The viewing experience was a great one. The Picture and audio quality was excellent. I Enjoyed the streaming experience very much.
0316247545|5.0|This ponyriffic handbook (hoofbook?) comes with a short little sleeve around it, which is cool, but should probably be slid off for much easier holding. (It just lets you know that this is in fact The Official Guidebook and such, so you don't go thinking it's the actual Elements of Harmony book Twilight read. ;) The back of the sleeve features sparkling Alicorn Twilight, and one inner flap shows the three little chapter books (I'm assuming that Fluttershy, Applejack, and Rarity will eventually have their own, perhaps?)<br /><br />Anyway. This manual isn't merely a presentation of things we already know from watching the show; there are enough interesting exta tidbits, including glorious pre-production and concept art drawings (a few with notes made on them), to make this the MLP book for adult bronies, as opposed to only the children. There is a lot of wonderful focus on explaining what makes FiM as magical as it is, and why its appeal to people of all ages, genders, and walks of life is strong enough to generate such an explosive worldwide phenomenon.<br /><br />Various character quotes written in all directions and colors cover the front- and endpapers. It starts out just like the show (and just like the book that precipitated the ponies' first adventure), with the illustrated tale of Celestia and Luna, and the rise and banishment of Nightmare Moon. I absolutely love all of the wonderful, inspiring words of insight, wisdom, and humor from Lauren Faust, Jayson Thiessen, Meghan McCarthy, Amy Keating Rogers, and other folks responsible for bringing us this amazing show. The book is awesome for including so much of that (although I am still curious as to what they decided in regard to saddles...why were they developed in a human-less world? Kind of like how the \\"Cars\\" cars came to be designed the way they are...so ergonomic in a world without humans! I'm guessing that saddles may allow ponies to carry things, or possibly one another, on their backs, and also evolved to serve as a fashion accessory.)<br />As a matter of fact, the exclusive interview with Lauren Faust is one of the more revealing and interesting sections--although I'm not sure when it was conducted. Loved everything she had to say about the characters, the selection of their elements, and so forth (although now I'm extremely curious as to which three Elements were originally wielded by each of the two main Alicorns. Oh, and that's another thing--the book continuously calls Celestia and Luna unicorns, when it should be employing the term Alicorn.)<br />Hee, her favorite pets are Angel and Opal. :3 Mine are Winona, Tank, and Owloysius (oh, and Philomena as well.) Anyhow, not to say too much more...once again...good stuff!<br /><br />Pursuant to the \\"mane\\" cast members, various other significant and semi-significant characters are also pictured, identified, and introduced, or merely labeled. Some of the more important speaking ones are provided with the episode(s) which feature(s) them. I found a few worthy of note, including the \\"garden trio\\" of Daisy, Lily Valley, and Rose--I like the name Roseluck, but apparently they decided to drop the \\"luck.\\" Lotus Blossom is pictured without Aloe--GASPETH! \\"Colgate,\\" \\"Bon Bon,\\" and \\"Carrot Top\\" are, of course, Minuette, Sweetie Drops, and Golden Harvest...but the former fan names are still excellent nicknames for them. They simply didn't merge as well as \\"Lyra Heartstrings,\\" which I'm so glad is her officially perfect name.<br />You've got DJ PON-3 (no mention of her non-stage name, but we can assume) and Octavia...and speaking of musical ponies, I'd like to hear some from \\"The Pony of Pop\\" (Sapphire Shores!) I was disappointed not to see Fleur de Lis among the Canterlot residents. Derpy Hooves is depicted on the \\"Cloudsdale Ponies\\" page, adorably asleep on a cloud...and unlabeled. Again, they may have been forced to censor her name, but they kindly have not replaced it; Derpy is Derpy, whether or not we ever hear a characterrefer to her by name again. I love the Wonderbolts' names, especially Fleetfoot, Rapidfire, and Silver Lining. The only two shown, unfortunately, are Spitfire and Soarin (spelled without an apostrophe, which I tend to use, but either way's good.) Other characters remain unnamed (e.g., \\"boy bullies,\\" \\"bowler ponies\\"--not the Lebowski trio, alas!!, \\"Muscle pony\\"...Roid Rage to me, lol!)<br />Curiously, the lavender Pegasus with the cool sky blue-and-white mane who's been referred to as Cloudchaser is identified as Stormwalker. Not gonna lie, Stormwalker is an awesome and very fitting name...but it's a bit tough to rename somepony after they've had another name in your headcanon for a while. Oh, well. I can go with it. They must either not have been aware of her having a fandom name, or just really wanted to keep their own idea. Her sister/cousin/BFF or whomever she is, is still Flitter.<br />It amuses me to no end that Steven Magnet is the sea serpent's official name. It's so odd, random, and seemingly kind of senseless unless you know the reason for it.<br />I was hoping that Twist's full name would be given as Peppermint Twist here, but oh well. (As long as we see more of her in the future, I'll be happy.) \\"Owlowicious\\" is spelled thusly by the creators, which I knew--although I will continue to use Owloysius, just to keep it more similar to Aloysius. I've actually always liked that name.<br /><br />The chapter on villains/antagonists is very good, and I found myself very much agreeing with and appeciating what the makers had to say with regard to the \\"dark forces\\" and the more dangerous creatures of Equestria.<br />The bulk of the book consists of the episode guide, color-coded by season--plot summaries and friendship lessons of the first three seasons, sprinkled with lots of fun images and scenes (just like the entire book.)<br /><br />Following that are song lyrics--whoot! Every song, from shorter Pinkie ditties to the full-blown showstopping musical numbers, is included. (Even Pinkie's \\"I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala\\" cheer sung to the tune of \\"Jolly Good Fellow.\\")<br />I now realize I'd been under the impression that Daniel Ingram was pretty much solely responsible for the music. In actuality, the lyrics were often done in collaboration or by a writer, when s/he needed to tell part of the story through song. Sometimes they wanted them to have the feelings of existing songs which do similar things in other stories--as a theater fanatic myself, I have instantly recognized the inspiration taken from various musicals and Disney films. (The fact that some favorite TV shows of mine have also definitely or apparently been referenced multiple times delights me even further.) I've said it before and I'll say it again: FiM HAS everything it takes to become a smash hit on Broadway. Um, if any staff members or theatrical producers ever happen to read this...give it some thought, and let me know...I'd love the chance to audition. ;}<br />Ingram is, naturally, the genius composer for the series' music. I love all of the great staff quotes in this chapter. Many of the song titles, somewhat unfortunately, are still only given as the original working names that initially designated their purpose in the story (e.g., \\"Laughter Song\\" instead of \\"Giggle at the Ghostly,\\" \\"Winter Wrap Up Song\\" instead of just \\"Winter Wrap-Up,\\" \\"Fluttershy Fantasy Song\\" as opposed to \\"So Many Wonders,\\" etc.) The song I have always called \\"Art of the Dress\\" is titled \\"Stitching It Together\\" in recognition of the fact that it's based upon \\"Putting It Together,\\" from \\"Sunday in the Park With George.\\"<br />Another thing that I'm not going to call an outright error, but do want to call into question, is the lyric \\"For I oh-so love the groom\\" from \\"This Day Aria.\\" I have gone with Cadence saying \\"For I also love the groom.\\" She's in Twilight's presence then, Twi obviously loves Shining Armor because he's her BBBFF, and she needs some reassurance that her intended sister-in-law loves him too! \\"Oh-so love\\" just sounds kind of awkward to me, and would be better as \\"do so love\\" if that were the case. That's probably the only \\"a little off\\" (perhaps) lyric worth mentioning here. There are other, somewhat (or very much) less significant discrepancies between lyrics as printed in the book and what I sing (e.g., \\"face has made a frown\\" vs. \\"face is made of frown,\\" \\"bust it out\\" vs. \\"bustin' out,\\" etc.) Not big deals because they all sound similar when sung, and sometimes it honestly is tough to tell which they were actually singing. On the whole, the lyric chapter is awesome, and I'm very happy that it's in here.<br /><br />The final chapter focuses on the show's fandom--its real impact on people's lives. That's a plain beautiful section.<br /><br />Among the fascinating facts gleaned:<br />Luna's original name was Selena--another one referring to the moon. Not that Luna doesn't suit her perfectly, but \\"Celestia and Selena\\" does have a nice ring to it. I wonder what spurred the change.<br /><br />I'm still a little cheesed off that they misspell the name/word Cadence with an `a' so that \\"Princess Cadance\\"'s name can be copyrighted, but it was a one-letter business decision...not a huge deal, so long as kids realize that that's not actually the correct spelling. And everypony knows whom I mean when I use the `e.' I spell a few names slightly differently than they're written in this book, but that's okay.<br /><br />We also get Faust's original intention for Zecora, the name of the library which is Twilight's home, a few intriguing points regarding the lands and history of Equestria, the princesses, the Elements, and more! There is a fantastic map of Equestria, which I only wish were larger and easier to read (say, a foldout!) It doesn't have *every* cleverly-named locale of which we've heard but not yet seen (seems we can expect to in the future, however!)...but so far, not TOO much appears missing. Everyplace we have been thus far is summarized in the chapter headed up with the map.<br /><br />All in all, the book is not thorough or extensive enough to be an encyclopedia of the show. Perhaps after it's finally over, we'll get a gigantic compendium of every last minor detail and background character ever to exist. For now, though, this is some darned good stuff. It's to be expected that there are a few typos and small errors here or there, or things that could have been written/edited better, but overall it's high-quality, well-written, and seems carefully compiled. The specificity varies from \\"Oh, cool, those are their names\\" or \\"So that's what that place is called,\\" to \\"Gee, I wish the descriptions could be more in-depth and go into the mythology behind these,\\" or \\"I wish the other characters in that group were pictured and named.\\" But I knew better than to expect overmuch of this guidebook. They couldn't have included everypony and everything at this point. It's still excellent for seasoned fans, as well as a fabulous intro--and hey, the covers are more than cool-looking enough that you just might be able to share it with someone who's skeptical of the whole pony/brony thing.included. (Even Pinkie's \\"I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala\\" cheer sung to the tune of \\"Jolly Good Fellow.\\")<br />I now realize I'd been under the impression that Daniel Ingram was pretty much solely responsible for the music. In actuality, the lyrics were often done in collaboration or by a writer, when s/he needed to tell part of the story through song. Sometimes they wanted them to have the feelings of existing songs which do similar things in other stories--as a theater fanatic myself, I have instantly recognized the inspiration taken from various musicals and Disney films. (The fact that some favorite TV shows of mine have also definitely or apparently been referenced multiple times delights me even further.) I've said it before and I'll say it again: FiM HAS everything it takes to become a smash hit on Broadway. Um, if any staff members or theatrical producers ever happen to read this...give it some thought, and let me know...I'd love the chance to audition. ;}<br />Ingram is, naturally, the genius composer for the series' music. I love all of the great staff quotes in this chapter. Many of the song titles, somewhat unfortunately, are still only given as the original working names that initially designated their purpose in the story (e.g., \\"Laughter Song\\" instead of \\"Giggle at the Ghostly,\\" \\"Winter Wrap Up Song\\" instead of just \\"Winter Wrap-Up,\\" \\"Fluttershy Fantasy Song\\" as opposed to \\"So Many Wonders,\\" etc.) The song I have always called \\"Art of the Dress\\" is titled \\"Stitching It Together\\" in recognition of the fact that it's based upon \\"Putting It Together,\\" from \\"Sunday in the Park With George.\\"<br />Another thing that I'm not going to call an outright error, but do want to call into question, is the lyric \\"For I oh-so love the groom\\" from \\"This Day Aria.\\" I have gone with Cadence saying \\"For I also love the groom.\\" She's in Twilight's presence then, Twi obviously loves Shining Armor because he's her BBBFF, and she needs some reassurance that her intended sister-in-law loves him too! \\"Oh-so love\\" just sounds kind of awkward to me, and would be better as \\"do so love\\" if that were the case. That's probably the only \\"a little off\\" (perhaps) lyric worth mentioning here. There are other, somewhat (or very much) less significant discrepancies between lyrics as printed in the book and what I sing (e.g., \\"face has made a frown\\" vs. \\"face is made of frown,\\" \\"bust it out\\" vs. \\"bustin' out,\\" etc.) Not big deals because they all sound similar when sung, and sometimes it honestly is tough to tell which they were actually singing. On the whole, the lyric chapter is awesome, and I'm very happy that it's in here.<br /><br />The final chapter focuses on the show's fandom--its real impact on people's lives. That's a plain beautiful section.<br /><br />Among the fascinating facts gleaned:<br />Luna's original name was Selena--another one referring to the moon. Not that Luna doesn't suit her perfectly, but \\"Celestia and Selena\\" does have a nice ring to it. I wonder what spurred the change.<br /><br />I'm still a little cheesed off that they misspell the name/word Cadence with an `a' so that \\"Princess Cadance\\"'s name can be copyrighted, but it was a one-letter business decision...not a huge deal, so long as kids realize that that's not actually the correct spelling. And everypony knows whom I mean when I use the `e.' I spell a few names slightly differently than they're written in this book, but that's okay.<br /><br />We also get Faust's original intention for Zecora, the name of the library which is Twilight's home, a few intriguing points regarding the lands and history of Equestria, the princesses, the Elements, and more! There is a fantastic map of Equestria, which I only wish were larger and easier to read (say, a foldout!) It doesn't have *every* cleverly-named locale of which we've heard but not yet seen (seems we can expect to in the future, however!)...but so far, not TOO much appears missing. Everyplace we have been thus far is summarized in the chapter headed up with the map.<br /><br />All in all, the book is not thorough or extensive enough to be an encyclopedia of the show. Perhaps after it's finally over, we'll get a gigantic compendium of every last minor detail and background character ever to exist. For now, though, this is some darned good stuff. It's to be expected that there are a few typos and small errors here or there, or things that could have been written/edited better, but overall it's high-quality, well-written, and seems carefully compiled. The specificity varies from \\"Oh, cool, those are their names\\" or \\"So that's what that place is called,\\" to \\"Gee, I wish the descriptions could be more in-depth and go into the mythology behind these,\\" or \\"I wish the other characters in that group were pictured and named.\\" But I knew better than to expect overmuch of this guidebook. They couldn't have included everypony and everything at this point. It's still excellent for seasoned fans, as well as a fabulous intro--and hey, the covers are more than cool-looking enough that you just might be able to share it with someone who's skeptical of the whole pony/brony thing.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I think this is a good movie, it was refreshing , no profanity or nudity, just good entertainment<br />Good for the family
B0054SMID0|5.0|Great movie!!  Full of adventure and excitement.<br /><br />I've watched it twice!!<br /><br />So good!<br /><br />Matthew is fabulous!!<br /><br />Enjoyed from beginning to end!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I would recomend this book to people who like to see generations face poverty, history and love of family. I thoroughly enjoyed this book . I have read two others of his which are equally good.
B005MLP8E0|5.0|Excellent acting and amazing photography. A bit over the top at some points, but for a film from this time it is exceptional.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Astonishing and lovely. Beautifully written. One of the best books I've ever read. Visit this circus. You won't want to leave in the morning.
B002ZM74Y6|4.0|If you like blood and guts, combined with a can do attitude and bombastic egos, that serves as a role model for bankers and serial killers then this is the movie for you.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|I heard from others how wonderful the movie Lincoln is, and I agree. We bought the DVD so we would have it to watch<br />over and over!
B000ICXQU6|5.0|The items in the box were as I expected them to be. The box was easy to open and the contents readily reachable. The packing material was just the correct amount. I have a certain fascination about extra terrestrial and if there is any such entity that exists.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|I put off watch Dexter for years even though people were raving about it because I assumed watching a show about a serial killer indicated an all-time low in American entertainment. Then I found out my brother liked Dexter and I trust his judgement so I ordered an episode which turned into two episodes.<br /><br />It is not gruesome at all. In fact, the &#34;killer&#34; parts in it are more alluded to rather than fully demonstrated. The part about him actually killing someone--like he is in the room with them about to kill them--is like a minute long but you don't see any gore. The rest of the show is just super interesting, fairly unpredictable and quite creative.<br /><br />I was trying to figure out a way to get around buying each episode on Amazon because for seven seasons with 12 or so episodes per season, my Amazon bill would be wicked high. Netflix doesn't offering it streaming and neither does Hulu but it turns out that if I add Showtime on my cable ($10 more a month) I can watch every episode from every season on Comcast On Demand. I'm glad I waited so long to start watching this because now I have tons of episodes I can watch back-to-back--I hate having to wait a week to watch the next episode of any series.<br /><br />Definitely get season 1, episode 1 so you can get the background and a taste of the show. I'm sure you'll love it.
B008XX6J4C|3.0|These guys are great and I love their music, especially with the wonderful nature scenery.<br />BUT I do wonder if they got permission to use the copyrighted songs. (ex. One Direction's<br />and Taylor Swift's songs, etc.) I know for hymns you don't need it, of course, but, well,<br />it just makes me wonder...
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I liked this story every much and I thought it was much better than the movie.<br />Also, for the light stomachs, do not read this book.<br />It is very grosom but if you look past that you will find it very enjouable
006178480X|3.0|I must agree with an earlier review, this IS NOT Rollins' best work. If you enjoy science fiction and, of course, Gray Pierce and Sigma, then you may enjoy this work. It seems like character development and interaction take a back seat to Rollins' story line which is somewhat far fetched. Bottom line - if you enjoy Pierce, Monk, Painter, Seichan, etc., then read the book simply because it is better than no book at all! But if you have read all, or most, of his earlier works you may be disappointed.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Downloaded to see weather radar. Shows map of the Hawaiian islands but no radar picture. Worthless for my purposes.<br />Didn't check maps for other areas since I don't live anywhere else.<br />Using Kindle Fire HD.
B005PK56TA|5.0|this series is great! You won't want to stop watching! Keeps you  on the edge of your seat! GREAT !!
B003Q97D48|5.0|This show is so addicting i watched the first seven episoded in one night omg i cant wait to find out who A is
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is the best! Loved season one, but  I think that season 2  is even going to be better!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Entertaining without being too easy or hard. Let's you relax while keeping your mind busy. Can't wait for additional levels.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|A lot of fun. Great way too pass the time. Easy and intriguing. Wish there was more than one level without having to purchase.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Look,<br />Lets be honest you have read the first two books already.  You have to find out what is next for each of the characters, and the only way to do so lies between these pages.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I thought this app would be cool because I love minions. Turns out it took forever to load plus it didn't let me get out of the game.Very dissapointed
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app doesn't work on either my Kindle Fire or Kindle Fire HD even though the Amazon store says it is compatible.  I am having the same issue as the other reviewer.  It plays an introduction then shows me a tip and says \\"downloading\\".  It locks up at that point and I cannot access any controls.  I have to shut the kindle down to get out of the app and regain control of my device.  I now have one very disappointed boy on my hands.<br /><br />UPDATE:  About a month ago an update was pushed out and now it works great on both my kindle fire and kindle fire HD.  My son and his friends (10 years old) really love playing it.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|this is the best game ever I want. to be a star this is helping hopefully I get discoverd . thank ya! !!!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|If you've liked Neil Gaiman in the past, you will like this too.  I like the ending, which I can't say I always do with Gaiman.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I have been using this app for a few months months now and it has not crashed or locked up once yet. It does what the developer claims it would do and is very easy to use, and presents the battery information in a well thought out UI. After the calibration has been performed it is very accurate and I have yet to see it be off by more then 10 minutes for either the charge or discharge estimates. I started out with free version and very quickly decided that this developer has earned their expectation to be paid for their hard work put into the making of this product. The option to have verbal notifications, which are independently setable for both charge and discharge cycles is very handy and informs you of the charge remaining while reading a book, playing a game,surfing the web, watching movies, etc so you never get surprised by running out of power while immersed in any activity you are doing on your device and can't see the power level indicator. Go Pro they earned it as well as the 5 star rating.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love this game.  Very challenging . Hope they come up with more levels soon.  Great puzzles and makes your mind have to really work.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is amazing its like you have your own horse and it real and everyone can see it well lets just say BEST APP EVER
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love puzzles and this game is full of non stop puzzle mania.  Each level adds a step or two and increase in difficulty.  Definitely recommend it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|To anyone who felt moved, inspired, or at all emotionally invested in the world that George R. R. Martin has masterfully created by watching the epic Game of Thrones TV series on HBO: it is worth your time and money to read the words with which Martin first told A Song of Ice and Fire. Martin's use of changing perspectives adds many more layers of depth to the characters and settings within the series, layers that will bring further appreciation of the world within Martin's brilliant mind.
B000VUCIZO|3.0|Woz's book is an enjoyable, easy read, but...the writing is a bit rough and ego-centric, and the story is outdated.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire was a very good book. It kept my attention from start to finish. Loved it!!  Now I'm off to buy the third book.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|great game I am supper happy that is was free keep it up guys. verry cool. i am completely intertained.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a good app that me and my cousin love to play with during our free time and all
B009KEN87O|5.0|The title says it all.  Its a fun, simple game.  I tend to play it when my wife is trying on clothes in the dressing room of our favorite dept store.
B008Y5FNL4|5.0|I have watched this movie so many times and never tire of it.  The directing, photography and music are great.  This movie is timeless and can be enjoyed for many more years.  If you haven't watched it, give it a try.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|I am a fan of musicals.<br />I had all original cds.<br />This cd is great.<br />but I have on of Oliver recorded in London 2 years ago...live...much better.<br />The presentation of wicked at the Tony awards is better than the defying gravity in the cd
1781162646|4.0|Do you really need to be told that Stephen King tells a good story? Yes, this is a good one.
B00AQ71FLK|2.0|Heroes of order and chaos is a great game but when the update came me and my friends were not able to play or get the update. once the bug is fixed i will give it 5 stars
B0035LJF2U|5.0|U2 fanatics and those that just like their music will enjoy this documentary that follows the band across America during their Joshua Tree tour. More than just clips from concert performances, the viewer is given some insight into the personalities of the members. There is a sense of discovery as the Irish rockers explore the roots of American music and its influence on rock in general. From San Francisco to Harlem to Memphis, the viewer is treated to all the members of U2 creating with a gospel choir and later legend BB King.
B003VPWX6K|5.0|People always say that reading is essential if one desires to improve his/her writings skills. Remains of the Day offers an excellent example of how language can be handled. Despite despite being an extremely depressing novel, &#34;it's not about the destination, but the journey.&#34; The story is definitely not plot driven. Rather, the purpose of the novel seems more to be experienced than to be followed. Nonetheless, one never seems to be lost by Stevens' habit to drift from memory to memory while narrating events in the present. Throughout the narrative, the author constantly demonstrates his ability to control language, and to suck the reader into the mind of Mr. Stevens without using explicit forms of communication. Although Mr. Stevens, the narrator of the novel, always uses stiff and reserved language to mask or describe his feelings, the actual struggling feelings of the butler are always evident to the reader.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The movement is so smooth and clear.  So addicted to this game.  Download this for my Kindle Fire and it looks and works great.
0515141429|4.0|The introduction of Jack Reacher is well done. You find out about him as the story progresses. You begin to care about the outcome and it has a satisfying ending while making you wonder what's next. As usual, I go with the story and I liked the book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My husband is kind if a scaredy cat (I know, right?!) so I was forced to watch this by myself. After having done so, I wouldn't have had it any other way! I loved this season. I enjoyed the storyline and development of the characters. I think the last episode was by far the best so keep watching until the end! Well worth it!
0887081770|2.0|I ordered this book as a gift for a little boy who loves the moon.<br />When the book came in the mail I was very disappointed with the size.<br />The description said it was hard bound, but not that it was mini.<br />It was exactly like the original with all the special pages,  I know because I had read it many times as an elementary school librarian, but just so very small.<br />When reading to small children it is so much more better to read from a larger book and to have the pictures large and easy to see for young and old alike.<br />It was just not worth it to send the book back.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Went hunting , came in handy when my knifes and saw need a new edge ,going to order a couple more for my tool box in my truck and my garage.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This a great series and this has been a very enjoyable set of DVDs with no problems. Highly recommended for all
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this app! I play it all the time. I especially like that there is a shop, and you don't have to pay with real money. you pay with coins you earn while playing.Get this app!&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|I'll keep this short but I think overall it's pretty good and certainly better than most of their modern material.  The first 4 or 5 songs are really strong and the vocal style reminds me of the stand-in singer for Saga on their Human Condition album.  Great performances through and through.  Best album since Tribe ( I like Tribe, I know a lot of people don't).  Give it a whirl!!!!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The story doesn't really go anywhere... I will not be reading the next one.<br />I think the author wanted to get another book out asap, and put the book out without having a great story to go along with the characters. It's unfortunate, I wont waste my time or money on #4.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|One of PIXAR's finest movies. Not only is it fun for both adults and children (my parents were laughing the whole time), it's a great movie to help little ones with the normal bed time fears of monsters in the dark. I wish I'd had this movie when I was little! When buying this movie, remember that there are different regions for DVD players. Make sure you buy the right region. Almost all the 1 star ratings are due to people not bothering to make sure they bought the right region and then complaining about their \\"defective product.\\"
B00CW665VI|5.0|Brilliant.... this story has to be the most unique I've read this year. Not so much the story line of girl meeting guy and falling in love but the way the story is told is just awesome.  How Emma Chase gets into the mind of a man and brings that to life on the pages of Tangled is incredible!!!  I loved this romance story and I especially love that as the story progresses from Drew's perspective that he turns and talks to the reader as he's telling the story... INGENIOUS!!!  I love the play between Drew and Kate throughout the entire book, I love Drew's family and the side stories they bring, and I love how Emma can really know what men think and make Drew say it (hahaha some of them so funny)  One of my favorites of the year.  Can't wait for more of Drew and Kate's story to continue....<br /><br />Do I recommend... Absolutely.  Don't miss this one.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play solitaire every day, either on my computer or on my kindle fire.  I usually play the randome version because it is more challenging.  Reading and games are my favorite pastimes, much better than tv.  I can also play this game if I don't have access to the internet.  Great fun
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Two amazing characters, Rick and the Governor. The governor hides his sadistic self very well and plays on the peoples feelings for survival. I do like the fact that he was able to organize a town and its amenities. I could really see Rick doing something like that.
B004SBX112|5.0|I had the original version and finished that , so I got the above version and play it all the time.  It is great fun trying to obtain a three in all categories, and I don't get interrupted when I am about to score.  Playing these games is one of my favorite pastimes
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|The product is made with cheap materials. Because of the cheap washers and wing-nuts, the top bar with the fixture that fits into the spout of the bottle slips mid-cut, therefore, making the cut uneven and ruining the project. While I was able to get a handful of successful scores in, the cheap metal wore out and now it just frustratingly slips away. Instead of wasting time and money with this product, I would recommend purchasing the materials necessary for making your own jig. I regret not making my own jig, since there are an abundance of videos and instructables explaining how to build one.
B005ES12S2|5.0|I have plantar fasciaitis on both heels.  Crocs are cushy and really help my heel condition.  These two-tone crocs are very stylish.  I am very comfortable wearing them.  Highly recommended.
B008Y768XO|4.0|If you love animals particularly dogs this is a great movie. Bring the tissues. The topper was at the end you find out its a true story. Gotta love dog loyalty.
160459201X|5.0|while there is nothing new in this book that you havent already read, the approach and decriptions are great.  A difificult read due to all the excellent content
B00BXRFCFM|3.0|If you have followed BMTH from the beginning you won't love this. It's not terrible but it certainly doesn't evoke the powerful emotions I'm used to when listening to this band.
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|My Dad loves Star Trek, so this came in the mail just in time for Father's Day. He hasn't had a chance to listen yet, but I liked that they're not all instrumentals or theme music, which can get boring.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I first watched this traveling to Europe and like it so well and rented and watched with my husband when I got home.
B009NY43NY|1.0|This series has just been going downhill the last couple of books. I believe the last great book was Dead and Gone and that is it. For those who have been devoted to the series are going to be disappointed. It's not the outcome that bothers me though, I expected it as much and as an author she did the right thing because it does make sense for Sookie's character to be with this person in the end. The problem is the lack of emotion with each relationship she has! Nothing is resolved like it should be. We are reintroduced so to some characters which is sort of nice but nothing major happens.  It pretty much gives readers a short sweet. Goodbye to them and that is it.<br /><br />Spoilers from here read no further if you haven't read it.<br /><br />I just don't get why Charlene Harris didn't try harder to end the series better then she did.  I almost gave a two but she doesn't even deserve that! Her books were once well written and she had great character  development. It seems she lost it since Sookie starts dating Eric.<br /><br />I think we all know that Eric our favorite vampire wasn't meant for Sookie.  His lifestyle never suited her needs and his position never allowed him to spend any time with her. Eric however doesn't act like the Eric we've all come to love!  Where is his fun cocky attitude? Where is his fight and possessive behavior?  Sure he makes threats to Sookie about keeping her but never does anything.  We have the same stupid pattern in this book where we have a murder mystery in which Sookie is the intended victim and everyone tries to protect her.<br />Considering its the last book of the series though, would have been nice to have something more thrilling and exciting. The only unexpected thing was Arlene getting killed which threw me off for a couple of minutes, but that is it.<br />There was no resolved feelings with Eric. Sookie just gets mad, and Eric gets mad and leaves. I would have liked to have seen her back with Bill at some point. But sheclaims to not love him, yet admits his betrayal hurts the most? Why does it though? It's not just her first love betrayal and she had real feelings for him. Bill was an idiot but he was also kind and sweet to her unlike Eric. Sookie could have resolved her feelings in that department but no nothing. No emotion at all when she realizes she loves Sam, just sex. It was thanks to Bill she was able to control her thoughts and realize she didn't have to be with a vampire to be happy. Sookie deserved to be with a guy who can have a family with her and have breakfast in the morning with her. Least Harris could have done is shown more love with Sookie and Sam instead of just letting it be this way, just because.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|I found the book hard to read because of the different time periods portrayed and even some of the made up dialects were hard to understand.  The characters from the distant past (the composer and bookkeeper) used words and phrases that went over my head and I had to look up constantly.  It ruined the story for me.  My favorite story in the book was about the server.  I really thought the movie help me understand how the different stories came together better.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|i could not think of a better book to recommend to someone who loves extreme detail, suspense and just sheer awe at how the two worlds connect to our own. wonderful, just wonderful.
B005SAP45I|4.0|My grandson enjoyed the movie very much. He loves Cars 1 and had seen Cars 2 before but it still kept his interest.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2PM4JLDDKOUBW]]Gina from Haunted Flower reviews \\"World War Z\\" starring Brad Pitt....which is supposed to be based on the book by Max Brooks. Pardon the large monster flies buzzing through the picture.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|A friend had just finished reading the book and we rented the movie afterward. I had read the book and watched the movie a couple years ago and had forgotten how good it was until I watched it again. The book is always better than the movie version because it offers so much detail but the movie is well worth watching!
B00007KWHP|5.0|Product was exactly as described, brand new, fast shipping. I was happy to find this album on CD, I am try to reconstruct my vinyl collection which was stolen.
B005K17RU0|4.0|It works better than my HTC Phones weather app...eleven, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. stupid to ask for a set amount of words...this is not the 4th grade...
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|A fun film ...one mistake observed is when Gretel in the beginning scene calls the townpeople - HILLBillies?  I don't think that term was around back then.<br /><br />Loved the action scenes.  Acting is very good.  A good story twist for H&G. Kudos to the writers for this one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. I really like the escape games. And this one does not disappoint. Can't wait for more levels.
147674355X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book more so in the first half than the second. I loved the teasing back and forth between Sky and Holder and watching their relationship progress. Things moved along quickly and I didn't want to put the book down. I can say though that I was able to predict what was was going to happen very early on in the book and was hoping things could have been made a little less obvious to keep the suspense going. The second half of the book kind of slowed me down a bit just because of the dramatics of it. At times I felt like I was reading the same lines over and over and was kind of disappointed the entire last half of the book was all about \\"what happened\\" to Sky and we lost Holder and Sky's playful relationship. I don't want to spoil anything so I can't say much more on the subject, but the sex scene thrown in where it was, after \\"what\\" happened seemed pretty ridiculous to me and made me think \\"who does that?\\" All in all it was a great read but gave it four stars for the reasons I have listed above.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|I liked it a lot but its not the best thing in the world.They could make it more interesting for kids.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game If you love puzzle games that you have to figure out with no help this is the game for you.  it is not easy but very addictive and gives your brain a workout.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Keeps getting stuck in load page. I can't even get to my hone screen on my Kindle. I end up having to restart the tablet.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My little pony is one of my favorite shows. When I found this game I played it non-stop!! Its super easy and you can get money easy.
B006RE76KA|1.0|My ears hurt half way through the first song, but I figured I should give it a try, as it I understood it was praise music. I got a little skeptical when after the first three songs were heard and none contained the Lord's name. I bought this for my youth group and sure am glad I didn't play it without listening! This is false advertisement Lamb of God, and you should feel bad!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this well-priced sci-fi book after hearing a glowing reference to it in a radio broadcast. I was not disappointed. It was engrossing with memorable, vivid characters and careful plot lines: I could pick up the story and put it down without needing a flowchart of the characters and action. The writing is natural and moves the plot along expeditiously. The underlying theme develops to a reveal at the end that is satisfying and thought provoking. I highly recommend this book.

B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I heard this was a good movie. I thought it was a little too long and drawn out. It was a little difficult to catch on to it until it was about half over. It's not a movie I'd want to re-watch.
B00A993UWM|5.0|She's crazy but I like the album. Very upbeat and vulgar. Would it be Kesha if it were anything less...
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|The story is set in a medieval Venice-like town, where a group of thieves steal from the rich, but don't give to the poor. There's just a touch of magic and the story moves at a rapid pace. It was a fun and quick read.

B00280LYIC|5.0|Lots of fun. Quick read. My 4th grader loved it!  Amanda and i look forward to the next Percy Jackson quest.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I liked both but really enjoyed the book much more. I like zombies but wouldn't say I am a huge fan of the genre. This book is a completely different take and comes from a very unique perspective.<br />It is written post apocalypse, and is really more of a historical reference from every corner of the world and explains what different cultures did to combat the living dead. It gives you a glimpse of how humanity prevails and to what lengths people will go to try and preserve mankind. It strips everyone down into mission essential categories. So who once was the gardener on some rich trust fund persons estate, now is highly regarded as a farmer, and  the trust fund baby works menial labor because they have no criticle skills.  I enjoyed reading this book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I LOVE THESE BOOKS.  I COULDN'T PUT THEM DOWN.  I BOUGHT EXTRA SETS FOR MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW AND ONE FOR MY HOUSEKEEPER.  I HOPE THE AUTHOR WRITES MORE OF THESE CHARACTERS.  LOVE THEM, LOVE IT!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is such  a good and fun game! I enjoy it so much and my 10 year old loves it too!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was recommended by trusted friends that read a lot.  It's supposedly a 'young adult' book, but should not be overlooked by 'mature adults'.  A very compelling read.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is a good challenge for my 7 year old.  He feels like a detective.  I like it too!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|good game .. it's. hard but good it was also kind of challenging but I like. that.. you should make more games like this!(:
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I'm still reading this book and I will be buying more of this author.  It is keeping me interested in the story.
B00C9U9YLA|5.0|Awesome songs? Check<br />Awesome musicians? Check<br />Groovier than a dance club in the 70s? Check.<br />What more do you need?...
B008Y768XO|5.0|This movie brought our family to tears.  A touching story that is worth watching.  I would recommend this movie as family-friendly, however because it is rated &#34;G&#34; (as with any movie) it is always a good idea to preview first.
B004EPZ034|3.0|I understand that the item was used, but it should still play all the way through. I was pleased with the timely manner that I received the video, but when my children showed me a frozen image of the movie less than 30 minutes into it, I wasn't happy. The disc does not appear to be scratched, so I can only assume that the vender just eye-balled it and called it good. Wish I could give this vendor a 5, but they really should be sure that their product works.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This book was a pleasant surprise. So many twists and turns and you could never guess what was coming next! A good introduction to Gillian Flynn novels.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I wanted to write a review on this book after the first 50 pages and not finish reading it but after reading reviews by people condescendingly declaring that they actually read the whole book before writing, I decided to gag it down and eventually write one. If I can spare just one person this distracted and ill-conceived tome, it will be worth it.<br /><br />I love and adore the Harry Potter series. I believed that Ms Rowling showed a true gift for story-telling for young people in a way that also entertained older people, as well, but they were most definitely geared toward kids. I read and re-read them to my son. I edit books for a friend and am very alert to typos and misspellings that are easy for an author to make and the Harry Potter was so clean and free of those. Not so for Vacancy. It was undertaken so carelessly, as if Ms Rowling felt she must churn out something to placate her reading public, turning her back on the audience she was so suited for and targeting adults, for whom her writing is not suited, causing her editor to fail to find the mistakes, as that would require reading all of that book.<br /><br />The book was dreary, depressing, and focused on the nasty, back-biting traits of small-minded, petty people to a huge degree. I was starting to wonder if that is just how the British generally behave as a whole. That is certainly not my experience as an American, and it was depressing and disheartening through and through. Where people in many communities here rise up to help those in need in their communities, and to help those in other countries as well, the characters in this book treat people with disdain, disrespect, unkindness, or indifference, and this kind of behavior was the norm, not the exception. It painted a picture of whole communities of snobby, petty people always looking for weakness in others to exploit in some way, whether for gain, entertainment, or comparison to bolster some kind of pride, even when in the act of so-called helping them. It was sickening to live for any length of time with those people.<br /><br />Ms Rowling's portrayal of the sexuality of the young people in this book seemed, to me, to be inappropriate, graphic, and disgusting. Her omniscient writing style - which bounced us unmercifully, sometimes confusingly, and often randomly, through the minds of all of her characters - gave the expression TMI (too much information) new meaning. It seemed over the top, disgusting, and inappropriate to be focusing so deeply and graphically on what those teens were doing and why. As one who works with abused and neglected teenagers, I found it disturbing for an adult to be so focused in such a graphic and disgusting way on this aspect of those teenagers, both on their actions and their thoughts. I also kept thinking that this was just another book written for kids disguised as a book for adults, as the main characters focused on were the teens, with the adult dramas related to the teens secondary in importance; In fact, it was as if the adults were only there to prop up the appearance that this is a novel for adults. I guess if you are an adult who wishes to be forever a teenager then maybe?<br /><br />Overall, I simply could not believe this is the same person who wrote the Harry Potter series. It's so foreign to her former work that I have to wonder who actually wrote either Harry Potter or this book. I do not recognize her style at all and I believe she utterly failed in her attempt to transition as a writer for adults. If she wants to write for adults, she needs to write about adults. If she has such disturbing fantasies about teenagers and this was, in her mind, the only socially acceptable way to write about it, then that explains this work a bit better. Personally, as an adult I have no interest whatsoever in the private thoughts and behavior of random teenagers. I had enough of it with my own passage through those challenging times, which were in no way remotely like Ms Rowling's teens' experiences.<br /><br />If you like depressing, poorly written, confusing, random writing that offers no redeeming hope, value, or goodness and ends badly for all involved, then this is the book for you. I never read books like this and it was only because of my love for this author's previous books that I slogged and suffered through this mess. I will not bother with reading her work ever again unless she returns to writing for kids and makes sure she has the same quality editing that the Harry Potter books had. I have learned from reading reviews here that I can't trust the reviews, either, as there were several who highly praised this garbage. All I can say is it is people like that who allow bad writers to thrive.<br /><br />Don't waste your money or your time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Not your typical drama.  It has good character developmentand each episode draws you in.  You feel part of their lives.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Not as good as the first book. I'd like to read more about Gideon's family. We've gotten tidbits & now it's time to find out more about them.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I thought that this book would not meet expectations. How good can a ghost writer be? I was way wrong. Very well paced and a great \\"who done it\\". Since I've watched Castle from the beginning I found all the characters voices in my head matching the voices from the show. A plus. Try it, you'll like the book a lot.
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|Classic. One of the greatest movies of all time, it's fun and thrilling. I would recommend to anyone who hasn't seen it and enjoys science fiction thrillers.
B001NLL93W|5.0|The best version of love story possible! A story for all... a romance, a mystery, an action adventure, and of course a drama as well. A little of something for everyone!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app has a many sounds and I love that you can mix them to create your own relaxing combination. I have tried a few &quot;noise&quot; apps and by far this is my favorite.  Samsung GS3
B00992CF6W|5.0|This had to be the best game ever I am so obsessed with it!!!! So worth the money, buy now. IT IS SUPER FUN!!! :D
B003ASLJK4|5.0|I enjoyed the book and had seen the movie before. I am happy to have it<br />in my collection.  A good story performed by talented actors!
B009GXHOW4|5.0|U can change creative back to survival and stuff. It helped me so much, I love it! Now I have diamond and gold, and big houses!!!!! :D
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|True fans are not to be disappointed.  All of the traits of Alice in Chains; the blending harmonies of vocals, aggressive guitar riffs,  raw acoustic hit songs, and of course the beloved death and decay elements in the mysterious yet brilliant lyrics.  Written mostly by Jerry Cantrell,  it is good in an interesting way that the band seems to be dealing with some sort of catharsis.  Indeed pain and hardship does many time help create the most interesting songs.  Also more broad topics are addressed such as on the title track the band tackles common issues of the Christian institutions.<br /><br /> I would say with these 12 new songs does allow them to avoid the so-called sophmore jinx once again.  To the seasoned fans, I would say just let it ride
0793563836|4.0|My one/only gripe is that this teaches with upright/string bass think (4 fingers cover 3 frets instead of 4 frets), & because students have different size hands, what I do is either run with it with &#34;traditional&#34; fingering for small hands or get my pencil out & change the fingering for larger hands or if I see that the student is okay with a 4 fingers/4 frets finger positioning.  Other than that, this is a great book & makes the chore of learning to read fun because the exercises are more &#34;real world&#34; & useful down the pike.  Definitely good enough for me to continue to get it for my students.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|Great songs on this CD.  Had just seen Paul McCartney in concert, reminded me of how wonderful the Beatle's music is.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This journey I started 23 years ago is finally at an end. This book completed the story perfectly. Robert Jordan would be proud of the work that Brandon Sanderson put into completing this story.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run 2 is a great sequel to the original game. It is a fun, hilarious,<br />and entertaining game. I will play temple run 2 for a long time you should too!!!!!!!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|What a  wonderful treat to see such quality entertainment on your site; I would give this program series 10 stars if I could! Keep up the good choices!
0061978078|4.0|I stayed up until 3am finishing this one and can't wait to grab the third in this trilogy.<br /><br />When we left Lena in Delirium, she had just made it over the fence into the Wilds only to see her love, Alex shot and captured thinking he must have died (because it's torture living with the hope that he is alive), she stumbles on through the night. Pandemonium picks up right where Delirium left off, with poor Lena alone in the Wilds trying to find her way to Alex's camp. She is thankfully rescued by some \\"Invalids\\" and discovers that she had traveled quite a way in her delirious state. Slowly, Lena picks up the pieces of herself and finds the strength to keep living as Alex would have wanted. She joins the rebellion and starts surveillance of Julian, the poster child for the DFA, in New York. After a riot at a DFA ally, Lena is captured with Julian and held prisoner. She must fight her way to freedom and finds herself fighting her feelings for Julian as well.<br /><br />There were plenty of plot twists that left me breathless and flipping forward for more. I love the way Lauren Oliver writes...some of it is like pure poetry. The ending...holy cow...wasn't expecting a couple of those twists at all. Unfortunately, nothing seems to be easy for poor Lena at all and the journey her life takes had me sobbing along with her at some times, and hoping for happiness at others. I can't wait to grab the final installment and see where the new love triangle takes Lena.
B000YABS8E|4.0|I have not recieved my copy yet, but i saw this movie several years ago and it is one of the funniest ever. I do not know if Brandon Frazier was actually doing the dancing in it  or not... but whoever was was fantastic!

0525478817|4.0|I'm sure all the other reviewers have said it, but this book is a real tear-jerker. Both from the heartbreaking plot line and from the honesty of the narration. Hazel has a distinct voice infused with wisdom that only comes from close contact with death.
B004M3GDI4|5.0|Best head torch EVER and I have been getting longer out of the battery than specs so very very happy
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Worth getting really good game just get it I play hours in this so get playing really good price ( free ) but if I was to pay £1 I would have !!!!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This app is great for all ages but I couldn't figure out how to unlock everything so I just paid 99 cents to unlock everything wich is actually a pretty good deal.
B007XC9BSK|2.0|its too small, and it hasn´t got wheels.<br />i don´t like it so much it colud be better.<br />thank you
B003IKMR0U|4.0|This is a fun, quick and easy game. I played it with my nine year old for the first time, and he immediately understood the rules and strategy. His four year old kid sister likes to &#34;help&#34; by rolling the dice and saying, &#34;Braaaaaaaaaaaains.&#34;  The dice are well made, and the dice cup (just a cut down poster tube) is sturdy and well sized. The rules are also clearly written and easy to keep with the game.<br /><br />We usually play for half an hour before the kids are ready for something else, so it makes for a nice short activity any time. My wife loves Zombie Dice as well, and we recently purchased a copy for her brother. Highly recommended.
B00280LYIM|5.0|i think that this book was amazing i loved it soooooooo much. i would advise this book to any one i know but you have to read the first 4 before reading this one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just keep going and see what is next. Gotta move this and that to find everything. Bigger rooms more spaces
B00280LYHS|5.0|this book has a nice twist at the end and it is an amazing book i couldnt put it down and when i did i was at the point where my eyes wouldnt stay open.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Ok, first of all, this thing is HUGE. But that is how it dissipates heat. Lots of surface area. Im using a Rosewill Challenger case and AMD 5800k APU. I couldn't even benchmark the computer with the factory supplied heatsink. Temps would crawl into the 70+ range D:. You couldn't even stay in the BIOS for too long without it overheating. Not acceptable. That is just asking for a case of CCS(Chernobyl Computer Syndrome)<br /><br />Ok, so some numbers for y'all. With the stock heatsink, system idle never got below 43. Averaged around 45. Now system idle is a frosty 33 degrees. And I CANNOT get the temp above 45c without OC'ing. I benchmarked the system, pegging the CPU out at 100% for around half an hour. Also did some really heavy high-res HDR editing in Photoshop. Temps didn't exceed 45c. Pretty good improvement.<br /><br />Not sure if I will OC it at all, but now I certainly have the headroom to do so if I want to. I think this will make a huge difference in the lifespan of my processor.<br /><br />Overall, this is the best 25 bucks I've spent on my build thus far. Highly recommended.
B0015UKX7E|4.0|.... Great 2 B able 2 watch @ my leisure.  I'm glad I bought it. ;)) wish there were more like this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is amazing I am completely. addicted. it shows what responsibilities you have when owning a horse. I love this game and would recommend. it to anyone
B000ICZD5M|1.0|I read the book years ago and really enjoyed it.  The video was vaguely comprehensible with a distant memory of the book, and would have been worse if I hadn't read it.<br /><br />Poorly acted.  Stiff, with none of the intricacies of the book.  Or perhaps the modern special effects make these older science fictions film look cheap.
B007704HO6|5.0|I loved this real life story which turned two lives around in a most positive way. I was ill when I read it and it made me better.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoy it fit sure. Good for break time at work when I've got a bit of time to kill.
B008BM9L72|3.0|It is all too good to be true, too much repetition esp. on the sex aspect, actually gets boring. I battled to finish the last two books. On the other hand, a feel good story if you manage to read it to the end.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is is really helpful.  Very clear graphics, extremely useful data...so I know exactly how much battery life is available for each type of use, and it also tells me exactly how far along I am in the charging process.  Love it.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game is definitely one of the better mysteries games I've played, slightly thrilling it puts you in edge and leaves you in a cliff hanger.
B002P4JKFA|1.0|When I ordered this I was happy because, although I already had the DVD of the film, I wanted the Blu-Ray version.  Imagine my surprise when what I received was the same old DVD I had bought some years before.  At least Amazon is good about accepting returns, but the bad part of that is I have to print out a shipping label, re-package the thing and then drive down to my local post office to mail it.  NOT good, and something I hope I can avoid in the future.  I should probably add that Amazon seems to be doing a bad job of this kind of thing lately, as I've had to deal with Blu-Rays that can not be shown in America, more DVDs instead of the Blu-Rays I wanted and so on and so on.  Hopefully whatever problems they are having will quickly be corrected.  I think part of the problem is that when you report a problem or call them by phone, you have to deal with someone in India or wherever.  As a Prime member, I don't want this to happen, but it seems to be happening with alarming frequency!
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|I watch a lot of TV and this is the best new show since Game of Thrones. Like Game of Thrones, it is a show best enjoyed without spoilers. Great writing & pacing make this an addicting show, but it's the brilliant acting by Tatiana Maslany that pulls it all together into one of the best shows I've ever seen. She pulls off playing multiple characters to the point where you forget they're all played by one actor. This show can't be placed into a single genre. You could call it sci-fi, but it's grounded in reality, where it seems very plausible in the near future. It's mystery thriller, drama, & even comedy at it's funniest moments, which there are many. So, if you love TV and great storytelling, you have to check out this show. The first season is only 10 episodes, so there is no &#34;filler.&#34; Just start from the beginning and enjoy the ride.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I have played MtG for years, both as physical cards and on the PC. The app version is great and it is a lot of fun to test my skill against the various theme decks in the campaign.  I also love the single player sealed deck games.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Enjoyed every minute.  The story line keeps you guessing and makes you feel you are involved in the characters lives.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|I watched this 2 days in a row.  Don't watch if you've had anything to drink or are otherwise inebriated!  It is complicated and you need to be sober!  lol...  I loved it, if there are any other movies out there people can suggest like it, I want to know!  It made my head spin.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read the hunger games and I loved it. I'm currently reading Catching Fire. I'm dying to see Catching Fire ( the movie ).
0425263908|1.0|I'm surprised at how many people think this book is better than the \\"Fifty Shades\\" books.  I can't say it's better written or that the character development was better.  I actually had to put it down, and could care less about finishing it at chapter 10.  NOT because of the sex scenes, but because it was so lame & contrived.  I totally didn't buy into this romance between the lead characters....there was like zero suspense in them actually \\"getting together\\" & dialogue was not clever, charming or witty - it was mostly cheesy, implausible or just gross.<br /><br />And this Mr. Cross?  OK, hardly think this counts as a \\"Spoiler Alert\\", but for me:  Use of the \\"C\\" word in ANY context (and ESCPECIALLY during sex) is not just a deal breaker, but I'd add \\"Attraction breaker\\".....it's just gross & after reading those \\"romance\\" scenes - I just couldn't think of the Cross character with any amount of attraction.  I kept picturing him as some cheesy lounge lizard.....wearing a black shirt, black jacket & white tie (as described in the book)?  Ugh, either bad taste or a cheesy Vegas type gangster.<br /><br />\\"The Fifty Shades\\" books might have been criticized as \\"fan fiction\\" - but I found the characters more likeable, the attraction between the characters believeable and the writing (especially the text/emails) more interesting & charming.  Can't write any of that about \\"Bared to you\\".
B004XQYBA2|5.0|Hey, I love Sudoku! I know, spelled it with a &#34;Z&#34; in review of &#34;Unolingo&#34;...life goes on. Different rank levels, checking the hint it will let you know where the error(s), is/are, IF you want to complete it, it will tell you where the error is and if you want it to correct it for you, suggestions where a box needs a number, etc. I enjoy the relaxation before I turn in...keep the mind going.  ;)  Enjoy with MANY days and evening, or whenever, playing this.<br />Paula
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|Only had this for a few days and although the report is quite restricted at the moment, it is very accurate.  I am glad I bought it.
6305511055|4.0|I liked the movie, but there was something that bothered me.<br /><br />I thought that the movie was a very accurate prediction of what has actually happened in the middle east, about thirty years later.  In the ending, Redford raised the question about whether we would invade the middle east over oil, and that is exactly what happened.  Even Cliff Robertson's argument that the plan would work and that the people won't care, they will just want our government to \\"get oil\\" was eerily predictive of what what this country did.<br /><br />The part that bothered me was, whatever happened to the mail man that Redford killed in Dunaway's apartment?  how did she explain to her boyfriend (when they returned from heir skiing trip) what that body was doing in her living room and what were all those bullet hole in her apartment all about?
B00992CF6W|5.0|My boys love this game. They will spend hours if allowed playing this game and building all kinds of things. They say it is awesome. There have been no problems with the app. It always comes up and works.
B00ADGSIRS|5.0|All I heard was Karl Bartos has a new album and ordered it.  If the album lives up to the cool aesthetic of album cover we may have a winner, if not at least the collection remains complete.  What luck.  After several listenings a day for half a week, well lets just say you deserve a nod and a firm hand-shake sir.  I know it can be tough to put out quality product on demand, but I hope Karl hops to it.  If he puts more material out before Kraftwerk, he really might have a point to prove!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was an awesome book to read. The characters were likable. This book kept me on the edge when it showed little glimpses of the abuse she had to go through and then when she ran.
0099547953|4.0|I bought this book for my 11 year old who is a MJ fan.  Recently we went on vacation and he took with him so I decided to read it so that we could discuss.  Took me no time to get half way.  It is interesting to read about MJ's life as he tells it.  We bought two more books for his teachers who are also MJ fans.<br /><br />AJ in North Carolina
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|..or this movie will bug you.  Jack Reacher is 6'4''.  Cruise was good, but this character doesn't do chase scenes, or drive much at all.  If you don't read the book first, you'll like it just fine.  I did, but my husband couldn't bare to see his well-liked character, cut down to size; do stunts, just to satisfy the Hollywood standard for an action film.  Picky, picky.  I liked the thinking Jack does in this film --and the ending isn't predictable, until very near the end.  Good villians, but the female lead (a defense atty)  was weak.  Her fawning looks at Jack, were a bit smarmy, and the actress didn't deliver her lines like she felt them.  Other than that, I enjoyed this film.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome I love  it so much<br />It is very addictive to. I rate it 10 out of 10 because it is a very good game and set out well.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|Every time my daughter tried to play this on my Kindle fire it would freeze my kindle. Had to delete it!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a good way to learn how to take care of a horse. I love how you can enter contests.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Steve Jobs was a complex person and his life a complex story. This book does a great job of balancing all that. It is well written and easy to follow. There were times I did not want to put it down - very engaging.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|After you upgrade your shark and become ready for the next one you should not have to pay so many coins.
B00CABLXU8|5.0|It's very rare that one can purchase an album by a group and say that EVERY song on that album is a winner. This album is simply fantastic! The songs are addicting, the vocals are first rate, and the harmony is \\"world class\\". All of the songs have catchy melodies with uplifting melodic hooks. The arrangements are brimming with attitude and energy, and will have you moving to the beat of the music. This album is LOADED with \\"hit single potential\\".<br /><br />There are a few different editions of this album depending on what country it was released in. I recommend that you try to track down the Italian edition of the album as it contains 20 tracks. But no matter what edition you purchase, you are in for a real treat if you buy this album.<br /><br />DNA is the perfect title for this album. D for dynamic, N for noteworthy, and A for amazing.<br />Definitely 5 stars all the way.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Loved it!!!  The pain in Jamie's life was so vivid, cruel and real.  McKenna is a great story teller.  One of the best books I've read in along time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is just like temple run and subway surfed at the same time<br />you tilt and slide using your finger<br />once you get to vector battle it is really hard to make it<br />also when they show the tutorial on the second one click the robot<br />put a new comment under &quot;lovestephsadvice&quot; or tell me that I need to add more stuff!
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I certainly wouldn't say this was the best movie I ever saw but I really enjoyed watching it. As someone currently expecting I found a lot of it to be pretty accurate and enjoyed all the perspectives.
B004Z7AHZC|4.0|Was looking for a video selection that was tied to a popular book.  This video fits the bill.  Highly recommended.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am so happy that I have this game.I&lt;3 this game. The first time I have ever played this game I was very happy.
B0050N8N0Q|5.0|The track \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" is not a track to be taken lightly. This is definitely real club stuff. So ya'll better run better run faster than my bullet. Real suburbia stuff happening in our modern reality.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Great graphics for a arcade style game.<br />. Evolving sharks and unlocking New sharks is Fun and addictive<br />. Can't wait for the next one.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I actually quit this game b4 bc it froze alot and was too expensive to advance in.  Trying it again, glad it saved my stuff from before!  Nice to see some things are on sale and more affordable now but the clothes for the peeps needs a lot of help!!!
B0091REZMW|5.0|this is a great game!! it much better on a kindle then a cellphone cant wait to continue playinn!! best picture find game yet
B0082RHRHC|3.0|I don't necessarily read these kinds of novels but I heard someone say that it was a good read. I gave it a three star because the story as a whole was good. I could do without all the arguments between the two main characters. I don't know if I would read another Brontë novel.
B007MCTTHY|5.0|This is a pretty fun game. It really gets your mind working sometimes. Hope they update with more levels soon.
0553288105|5.0|This is a great book for people who love science.  Asimov knows his physics, and you can almost believe that some of futuristic inventions are almost plausible in today's world!
