1439199388|5.0|I have read several different books and essays about the human microbiome and the 'hygiene hypothesis', but never one that as clearly and concisely summarized all of the different breakthroughs and research. I love that the author illuminates the potential of possible therapies while still cautioning against jumping headfirst into (self infection, among other things). I have recommended this book to many friends.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read bar none. Hard to put down once you start reading. Make you stop & thank those that scrafice their life for our freedom.
0671449028|5.0|My baby has loved this book since he was born.  Now that he is 15 months we are buying our second one after he tore apart the first one by first chewing on it when he was younger, then now by turning the pages so much lol.  It lasted well over a year though, I will keep the first one in his baby book as a cherished memory, all the nights spent reading this, and his favorite part is turn the page... &#34;TO EXERCISE&#34; :)
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|App does not work only video. Thankful didn't havevto pay for it cuz it doesn't work once you download. .
B00AL6SLQS|5.0|This set is self-commending, to the fan of Leon Fleisher, the aficionado of piano playing, the music-lover, and there is not much to add to the previous reviews. Nonetheless, I want to add this:<br /><br />FINALLY!!!! WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG, Sony????<br /><br />I mean, we are THIRTY years into the CD era!!!! Some of Fleisher's early recordings, those made before he lost the use of his right hand, and originally published on Epic or Columbia, had been made widely available by Sony, and first and foremost his unsurpassed Brahms Piano Concertos with Szell (1958 & 1962), paired with his Waltzes and Haendel Variations (1957), on Sony's marvelous collection Masterworks Heritage, [[ASIN:B0000029YK Brahms: Piano Concertos Nos. 1 & 2 / Handel Variations, Op. 24 / Waltzes, Op. 39]], his Beethoven Piano Concertos with the same forces, [[ASIN:B0000026GM Beethoven: The 5 Piano Concertos / Mozart: Concerto No. 25 ~ Fleisher]] (1959 & 1961), and his Grieg/Schumann Concertos from 1960, [[ASIN:B000BDGWFI Piano Concertos]]. Sony had also reissued the 1963 Schubert Sonata D664 and Wanderer Fantasy (Epic LC 3874 / BC 1274) on one of their budget labels, [[ASIN:B0000027P5 Wanderer Fantasie]], and the Brahms Liebeslieder Walzes with Serkin, Benita Valente, Marlena Kleinman, Wayne Connor & Martial Singher ([[ASIN:B0000027VP Schubert: Auf Dem Strom; Der Hirt auf dem Felsen / Brahms: Liebeslieder Waltzes; 4 Last Songs]]). In 1999 Phillips made available some of it on their Fleisher-Great Pianists of the Century series, [[ASIN:B00000HY8D Great Pianists of the 20th Century, Vol. 27]], but, frustratingly (as often with that collection), excerpts from LPs that the collector longed to see reissued complete: the Rach Paganini Rhapsody with Szell (Epic 1957) that came with Franck's Variations Symphoniques, never reissued, Ravel's Alborada del Gracioso and Sonatine but not the companion Valses nobles et sentimentales and Debussy's Suite Bergamasque (Epic LC 3554, 1959), Mozart's K 330 but not the companions K282 & Rondo K 485 (Epic LC 3584, 1959), Copland's Sonata and Rorem's Three Barcarolles, but not Leon Kirchner's Sonata and Roger Sessions' From My Diary (Epic LC 3862 / BC 1262, 1963). For Kirchner you had to go to CRI, [[ASIN:B00000JIPD Leon Kirchner Historic Recordings]], and for Sessions, just wait for better days. At least they gave you Liszt's Sonata AND Weber's 4th, both published on Epic LC 3675 / BC 1066 in 1960.<br /><br />OK, but (other than those already mentioned here above), what about:<br /><br />Schubert Sonata No. 21, D. 960 (Fleisher's very first recording, and NOT his late remake when he had recovered the use of his right hand, [[ASIN:B0002IQHHK Leon Fleisher: Two Hands]] - but how symbolic that he chose precisely that piece for his return, thus closing the circle) & German Dances D. 790 (Columbia ML 5061 1956)<br /><br />Hindemith The four temperaments, Netherlands Chamber Orchestra, Szymon Goldberg, conductor (Epic LC 3356, 1956)<br /><br />and Brahms' Piano Quintet with the Juilliard Quartet, from 1963 (Epic LC 3865 / BC 1265). Now this one! Such a long absence really baffles me. That Sony chose not to reissue Hindemith or Sessions, well, ok, I can see a rationale for that, those companies want to sell more than three copies. But Brahms' Piano Quintet with Juilliard????? And not an old scratching 78rpm mind you (and so what? EMI reissued on CD all their Busch Quartet, didn't they?), but a 1963 recording in full stereo???? I was so desperate at not seeing it back on CD that I even bought an LP copy some years ago (I haven't yet come around to hearing it, but that's another story). In fact, I was vaguely aware, and now see confirmation that there was an CD reissue by Arkivmusic a few years ago, listed here [[ASIN:B002A0E9TG BRAHMS: Piano Quintet in F Minor, Op. 34 - Juilliard String Quartet / Leon Fleisher, piano]] and available also on their website, but I don't know if they licensed it from Sony and remastered it from the original tapes, or just transfered the LP. The sound samples on Arkivmusic's website seem to sound ok, but then the CD (which may be a CD-R, in fact, although Arkivmusic is unspecific about it) sells at a price.<br /><br />Great to celebrate Fleisher's 85th birthday, Sony, but why didn't you celebrate his 75th, or 65th birthday? Why didn't you celebrate the recovery of his right hand?<br /><br />So, after all these years of patient waiting and impatient despairing, THEY ARE BACK! I usually object to the principle of the \\"original jacket collection\\", whereby, under pretense of reissuing the LPs as they originally appeared and stimulating the glands of nostalgia, you get far LESS music per CD, here it has the advantaged of bringing back with the recordings of Fleisher a few bonuses, like the complementary Hindemith program (Five Pieces op. 44/4 and Funeral Music), the Delius Irmelin Prelude. Schubert's Shepherd on the rock BTW is performed by Valente and Serkin, not Fleisher. And, to boot, we get the four recordings \\"late\\" Fleisher did for Sony, either for the left hand alone (3 CDs) and the three Mozart Concertos after his recovery.<br /><br />And with all that, you're going to think I'm grumping for no reason, since all this is back. NO. First, this is the outlet for years of \\"in petto\\" grumping and waiting. Under what entry was I going to write a review to lament at the absence on CD of Fleisher-Juilliard's Brahms? Second, I'm grumping in the sad memory of all those music lovers and Fleisher admirers who DIED between, say, 1990 (when Sony COULD have reissued all of this) and now. How many Fleisher admirers would you reckon died in the last 20 years? It could have been me, it could have been you! A silent prayer in their memory please while listening to these 23 discs.<br /><br />I am indebted to the online Fleisher discography on the website of the Library of Congress for my discographic information... and my years of frustration.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Love, love, love this series! Watched for the 2nd time, and saw many things I had missed on the first go-round. The characters are wonderfully developed, the story line is fantastic, the soundtrack awesome, and there is absolutely nothing negative I can say, except that after season 5, it's over.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I've used this analyzer to identify Wi-Fi signals and hotspots, interference on channels from multiple devices with different SSIDs. This is a great utility.
B007EC27QM|5.0|It does what it should, no problems, a good app for the Kindle. I would recommend it for anyone who has a Kindle.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The first book was really cool, but I got bored after it. Overall a good read, but I like faster paced books.
B00124PXW8|5.0|a groundbreaking film. no bad performances. audience shocking flash cuts that horrify on a subliminal level. Blatty did his homework for the novel and Friedkin brought it to life. highly recommended!
B003U4UPHG|5.0|my wife and I got interested in this show very quickly and now we can't stop watching it. Great action and mystery show.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|I have been a coach for 10 years, and this book is terrific.  I love the emphasis on effort over talent.  I have had players that have come to me with little ability and have seen then over a season transform into good players because they had the right attitude, and put in the work.  Does it mean everyone can be a superstar, no.  However, if anyone works through failure and puts in the time they most will improve.  I some of the kids I have worked with today don't seem to understand that effort and perservance pays.  Please read this book if you work with todays youth. There are powerful message that can be passed on.
B00EB6ENXO|4.0|Unless you've been under a rock for the last 5 years, you know that Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of Tony Stark in 2008's Iron-Man singularly brought Marvel Studios to recent prominence. It is hard to remember that Marvel Comics almost went bankrupt in the late 90's, and that Marvel Studios' last round of success came from licensing its properties to other studios - beginning with 1998's \\"Blade\\", starring Wesley Snipes as the titular Vampire Hunter. So yeah, no Robert Downey Jr, no Avengers... and no Wesley Snipes, no Spider-Man or X-Men franchises as we know them.<br /><br />Iron-Man 3 is a good movie but it is not a standalone story. A major plot thread of the movie references the Avengers so much, that this film essentially serves as a spin-off/sequel to that movie. But this makes sense, because Marvel has been deliberately trying to interweave all their movies into a coherent, persistent universe. And they have done such a good job at it that the latest movies using licensed characters (Sony's \\"Spider-Man\\", Fox's \\"The Wolverine\\") seem odd and weird for existing in a world without S.H.I.E.L.D. or the Avengers.<br /><br />If you somehow missed this in theaters, and you've seen the Avengers, then I can wholeheartedly recommend this movie. I would have given it 5 stars, but I took a star away for their portrayal of the Iron-Man armor's durability in the film. If you watched Avengers, you know that Iron-Man's armor stands up to Thor and aliens. In this movie, watch how it fares against both the bad guys, and even normal traffic. However, this actually works for the sake of the story and helps to explains Tony Stark's overall mental state after his last Super Hero escapades.<br /><br />Those are the only spoilers I'm giving you.<br /><br />Yes, the Amazon Unbox DRM doesn't always work, but there are \\"work-around's\\" if you have technical issues with installing the movie on more mobile devices than Amazon allows, or if the DRM file on your PC is corrupted and won't allowyou to download your purchased movies at all. None of this should factor into your opinion of the movie. Don't read reviews were people tell you the story. See it for yourself, watch the awesome extra features, and I believe you will be satisfied with your purchase.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! It is one of my favorite games and I love it even more because it was free it is worth getting this game I think everyone should have  it !!!!!  :-)
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Words can't describe the intrigue and the intensity of this book.  Just when you think Gideon and Eva are going to settle into wedded bliss another curve ball is thrown.  OMG!!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|You cannot get HULU on this device.  I should have read some reviews on it, but the way it was selling I thought there were many more choices.  The set up initially was easy, but every time I tried to use it, I have to set it up again and hold my breath to see if it will see my home wifi network.  I cannot get it to keep my network settings so I gave up on it.  It's gathering dust in the living room now.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Great stuff i like games like this they rock my socks hate being told what to do though anyhoo thumb up
B000H4TX9I|5.0|We watch this show everyday!! Can't understand why they cancelled it after the first season :( I would recommend this show to anybody who likes sci-fi type.
B004T0E2S8|5.0|Great tab app! I can find tons of Metallica bass tabs on here, plus everything from Pink Floyd to Led Zeppelin. I think this is an A+ app.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Winner of the Hugo for best novel for 2012. Funny ,thought provoking, serious and then funny again. Scalzi is one of the brightest stars in the writing world today!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|This is a movie with an interesting premise, good acting and lots of action. You get plenty of exciting chase scenes, shooting and running from Mr. Cruise, and pithy comments from Morgan Freeman. The special effects are excellent. It was not original or edgy enough to be a really great movie, but it is a solid, well-made sci-fi escape.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Amazing show! Gets you hooked from the beginning. Just good ole' enjoyable tv with a good story line. Hard to find on tv these days! Highly recommended!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The last book I read was just 'ok' and seemed to take me forever to finish it. I was so happy to this book brought back that &#34;I can't wait to go to bed!&#34; feeling again. (Just in case it needs to be said, I read when I go to bed.) Such a serious subject could easily have made this a 'heavy' read but the everyday humor had me laughing throughout. The author nailed every relationship - parent/child, friends, in-laws and, of course, the most complex of all, husband and wife. Cannot recommend it enough.
B008JFUR10|4.0|For director Guillermo del Toro, who grew up with Japanese pop culture, they are not just monsters and robots. They are \\"kaiju\\" (literally meaning \\"strange beasts\\") and \\"mecha\\" or giant piloted walking machine. You may expect from something subversive from the director of \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\" and \\"The Devil's Backbone,\\" but his latest effort \\"Pacific Rim\\" is surprisingly straightforward in telling the heroic story of kaiju-fighting robots.<br /><br />To me the best part of \\"Pacific Rim\\" is the pre-title sequence where we get to see the world of near future. Because of an inter-dimensional breach deep in the Pacific Ocean, kaiju attack coastal cities, with the first monster wrecking havoc in San Francisco in 2013. To combat these monsters, humans create their own \\"monsters\\": massive warrior robots called \\"jaeger.\\"<br /><br />The real stars are these giant robots and monsters, and their designs. Each jaeger is given a name (like Gipsy Danger, Crimson Typhoon and Cherno Alpha) and a back story that is more interesting that of the pilot. The way these huge robots move, operated from inside, is one of the most visually impressive parts of the film. Compared with them, all human characters are pretty flat except scene-stealing Ron Perlman's \\"Hannibal Chau,\\" though stars including Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba and Rinko Kikuchi are doing their best.<br /><br />With thrilling action sequences that does not rely on dark lighting and shaky camerawork, \\"Pacific Rim\\" delivers what it sets out to do: exciting battles of monsters and mechanical monsters.
B007FROH4G|5.0|Still Alice helped me greatly to appreciate and understand some of what it must be like for my sibling, diagnosed aged sixty and for the family, all in different roles in their own lives.  For the spouse, losing your loved one and becoming carer/parent.  The fact thst it was based in and around Harvard, Boston made it even more real.  Reading about the consultations and cognitive testing, so very exposing and revealing and so real.  Quotations from factual statistics of medics from their research and findings makes all the more believable.  I felt very very moved reading about Alice, so real. I made a pledge when I finished the book that in my future spare time I would like to offer to help to families of Alzheimer patients, by even just sitting with their loved one, to allow them some time out.  Lisa Genova tells the story in such a believable heartfelt way.  Thank you Lisa Genova.
B00E978FGQ|5.0|Watching the trailer in theaters I thought it would be generic movie. However to my surprise it was a great movie. I like movies that I can't predict,  beside it was done nicely. I regret not watching in the movie theater.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This is my favorite book of the series. I am completely invested in all of the characters. I do not consider myself a fan of fantasy books but I am hooked. Mr. Martin I can not wait for the next book.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|Unlike any Stephen King book I've read before. Touched my heart! Highly recommend to anyone, old or young. Read it!
B007BLCGNU|4.0|Love to watchj this to remind me how people in power can be weirdos. this guy sure was. boy did he get away with crap. blackmail everyone. while he was at home playing dress up. now he has a building named after him God bless America

B009Y6231U|4.0|I was bored so since I have enjoyed some of Kurt Russell's other movies I decided to watch<br />Soldier using my Kindle Fire HD. It starts out slow and it begins by showing how these soldiers are taken right from the hospital after they are born. They take you into the future and the odd thing about it was there was very little said by any of the soldiers except to say yes sir no sir and they followed orders even if it meant certain death. He (Russell) was old school and put up against a genetically superior soldier in a fight where he was killed. They dumped Russell into a garbage scow of sorts and while the ship was going to the planet where it would be dumped he became aware of his surroundings and before he knew it he was dumped on what seemed like a planet that was void of life. He was injured yet after reaching the surface he managed to find shelter and his military training kicked in. He began the process of healing his wounds so that he could get strong enough to learn more about his surroundings. He gets caught in a violent wind storm and some stranded humans found him and one of their women helped nurse him back to full strength. The entire time he said absolutely nothing though they used close up shots of his eyes and face that gave you an idea of what and how he was feeling.<br /><br />As he got used to being among this stranded group of humans he became less violent though you could see just how battle hardened he was when he did his daily workouts. He didn't say much of anything but kept watching one of the women who was married that had nursed him back to health. As time passed he was teaching children some pretty violent behavior so they had a town hall type of meeting and they banished him outside their compound. He went not saying a single word and found safe haven not far from the other humans. Then things begin to pick up, they are training the super soldiers by going to planets where they were most likely not going to find any kind of resistance. Once their commander realized there as a large number of settlers on the planet he gave his soldiers orders to wipe them from the planet not knowing that there was one lone soldier who he thought was dead was alive and well on that planet. As you might have guessed he crossed paths with these new super soldiers including the one that had supposedly killed Russell. He did go unnoticed by these soldiers and manages to warn the humans who had saved him that they were in danger. On his own with no real weapons he started taking out these so called super soldiers which made their commander think there was an organized fighting force on that planet.<br /><br />Russell then got help from the men that had banished him and as he took out these soldiers and then the armed vehicles they were driving until he got to the one that had the soldier that had killed or thought he had was in command of. It didn't take Russell long to disable it forcing a one on one fight between the two of them again. You might be able to guess what happened this time around but there was a twist where the husband of the woman that had nursed Russell back to health came to help him and ended up being killed but as he was dying he told Russell to take care of his wife and son. This is where you see signs of human emotions as Russell had a tear on his cheek and then several more but by the look on his face he had no idea what they were. It did seem that the man's death spurred him on with even more anger as he ripped his way through what was left of the newer soldiers until he caught up with their commander and...you can see what happens without me telling you.<br /><br />It must have been an extremely difficult part to play for Russell but one he managed to pull off quite well. I don't remember having seen this film in theaters, if it was it was for a very short period of time and many missed seeing what can easily called a diamond in the rough. I enjoyed it completely, start to finish..

B009UX2YAC|4.0|As far as a lot of the rail races go this one is fun and oddly addictive. I advise skipping new characters and focus on buffs for your runner instead.
B00D8HNQZI|5.0|If you are a NIN fan, this is one of their best albums ever! The more I listen to it, the better it gets. The sound quality is also excellent! I have the Vinyl & CD combo and they both sound great on my system with super deep bass and explosive dynamics! This album will give your speakers a real workout and you will enjoy every minute of it.<br />I was surprised when this album was announced since I thought they weren't making anymore albums. Man am I glad that wasn't the case. Seriously, a great album! I hope he continues making great music like this. BTW, if you haven't seen the video for \\"Came Back Haunted\\", it's easily the best NIN video since \\"Closer.\\"<br />Highly recommended!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Like everything about the production. Well worth time and cost . One of the finest works from public broadcasting. ( which are many).
B00CE0ZY46|5.0|My boys love Shaun! They could watch it all day & I wouldn't be driven crazy like I would with some of the other cartoons out there.
B006S01GH2|3.0|it was fun to watch but it was slow to evolve in the plot and where the story was going
B00992CF6W|5.0|I asked my mom for minecraft (pc) i got and love it but i dont play as much cus i got pc both price worth
140006922X|5.0|Historical content and references reveal the intensity of the author's research. It certainly made a lot of sense, giving the multitude of accounts of the time of Jesus of Nazareth, and the time lapses involved in those accounts.  I ill certainly read it again.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Really like the ad-free versions. Also this is different because not all about pigs!! Haven't tried the space one yet
B001GUXJQA|5.0|This book like his other titles is a lesson in patience and details.  Connelly is the antithesis to \\"don't sweat the small stuff\\" as that is where most of his stories get their momentum. I loved the lesson in Geography as well.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I love the game but a while back it updated and I lost all my stuff of which were things I played real money and are now gone I love the game but refuse to play it out of anger
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|The graphics are surprisingly good.  The game actually looks a little better than the pictures I think. The controls can be a bit difficult especially when &quot;drifting&quot; around a sharp turn.  The responsiveness to turns makes it difficult to slide around the big turns and stay on the track but I was able to figure it out in time to win the race on my second attempt. Probably worth the $1 asking price for a racing fan and absolutely worth a look while still a free app of the day. No sneaky permissions.
B000VWIBOO|5.0|This album includes &#34;Rocket man&#34;, and &#34;Honky Cat&#34; as well as the sometimes-radio song &#34;Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters&#34;. The songs here are catchy and creative, there is no room for anything syrupy. I wish Elton -and anyone else- still sounded half this good today.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Good read with multidimensional characters. Will definitely read more Harry Hole novels. Story took unexpected turns, turned into a kind of maze.
B00E0MCYPS|3.0|I think that this game is really hard because when my 12 year old plays it she can't get pass the drifting part so that s what I think
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|This album is true to the Fall Out Boy sound.  I enjoy listenting to it every time I play it.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|Demi did an excellent job on this album, her other albums were a little to disney for me and on this one she sounds so mature and the lyrics have so much meaning to them!<br /><br />Fav Songs -<br />Warrior<br />Heart Attack<br />Incase<br />Made in the USA<br />Really Don't Care
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|It is just the thing to relax with and clear your mind with a fun puzzle. I recommend it to anyone looking to zone out.
0812550706|5.0|I loved it!<br />Great for anyone who enjoys sci fi military books. This book is my new favorite of all my books.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This story shows the horrors of a restrictive, repressive culture  and the goodness that manages to shine through.  It is a beautifully crafted story that can't be put down.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I use this Anker battery almost everyday and would recommend it to everyone! It works great in the car on long road trips or even short car rides. And the best thing i discovered it good during is thunderstorms! You can't risk getting expensive electronics fried so buy this and if your power ever goes out you have it on hand to charge everything too!
0399159347|5.0|like this transaction and book was delivered and received as described. the cover jacket is nice and I am anxious to finish the book.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Great case! Its lightweight, doesn't make my kindle look or feel bulky. Its a classic simple design that gets its job done and it does it well. The price is great too, I'm a manager in an retail store and similar cases we sell were $20-$40.
B00E38KGF4|5.0|Works good and glad they have a virus protection for the kindle fire and would recommend this one I've try a few others and they aren't as good as this one
1885167776|5.0|This book was recommended to me after I commented that I was having trouble making time for my priorities.  This book is wonderful!  Such a simple concept - focus on the one thing, always make time for your one thing, do your one thing first.  Yet, it takes work to commit to it - a reason why so many people fail.  I got this book from the library, but I just may have to buy it.  It's the kind of book that makes me want to take notes so I remember the information for later and be able to go back through it and reread parts.  A great motivational book!
B000HVHM5S|5.0|This movie has both action and content. This is the perfect movie. For a brief moment, let go of your reserves, be open minded and watch this movie.
0451228375|1.0|Based on a friend's glowing description, I purchased both Pillars of The Earth and World Without End without reading any of the reviews posted to Amazon. What a mistake.<br /><br />I struggled through &#34;Pillars&#34; and gave it a 2-star review. World Without End is a rehash of the themes from Pillars without any of the former's few redeeming qualities. Follett went to the well once too often.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|It's a typical Tom cruise movie he must be desperately needing money to be making movies like this it's average so dont expect it to be great but still entertaining
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best app ever I play all the time it is great for teens ever one should get Mc pe it is amazing
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Fantastic.  Dredd is a two dimensional not conflicted character and that is exactly what he is supposed to be.  But the story isn't really about Dredd in my opinion.  It is about everyone else that Dredd interacts with in this messed up city and how they react to an unstoppable and incorruptible force.
B007THA4FI|2.0|While the writing is lovely, the characters and the plot are not.  The village is full of mean spirited and bitter people doing mean spirited and bitter things.  I could not find anyone to root for as the story unfolded.  Too bad because the prose itself is nice.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|I enjoy superhero movies and I enjoyed this one and gladly added to my collection would recommend to other people to watch
B008Y6XUTU|5.0|This is a feel good movie for us &#34;OLDER&#34; folks.  The chemistry between Nicholson and Keaton is good, the dialogue and story line are well done and if you have ever lived in the Hamptons and are familiar with the area it is like going home.<br />This movie proves that the we, not just the Brits, can make a movie that is enjoyable without special effects, rough language and blood.
B004XE0P5E|5.0|This is such a wonderful album, and I'll give my personal song review.<br /><br />Perth: 9/10<br /><br />Minnesota, WI: 10/10 One of my favorite songs of the album, soft and melodic and just great.<br /><br />Holocene: 10/10 Hands down THE best song of the album. Gorgeous.<br /><br />Towers: 9/10 Wish it were longer, its a cute happy song.<br /><br />Michicant: 9/10 Soft, slow, and sad but beautiful to sing and to listen to when you're sleepy<br /><br />Hinnom, TX: 8/10<br /><br />Wash.: 9/10 Soft piano song<br /><br />Calgary: 10/10 Upbeat type song, Its always on repeat on my playlist<br /><br />Lisbon, OH: 8/10 Nice instrumental song<br /><br />Beth/Rest: 6/10 Personally, y least favorite song from the band. Sounds like an 80's song, and the autotune sounds kinda funky in this song.<br /><br />But overall, this album is a MUST-BUY. Hands down, one of my favorites of all time.<br />Bon iver is amazing and so are the rest of their albums'.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The YouVersion of the bible is put out by Crossroads and is what I call a safe bible interpretation with studies, videos and much much more.  The whole package is free and gets the Word to everyone.  Well done Crossroads.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I love the rocky movies and now on blu ray I had to have it and have to say it's a great set on blu ray would recommend to anyone who wants the rocky movies on blu ray
0738737909|5.0|This deck follows the Rider-Waite tradition of imagery and meaning. The packaging is superb, a heavy and well made box that closes with a magnetic stay. The cards have gilt edges and are also made of heavy cardboard - they should last a long time.<br /><br />The cards are each a work of art. I bought the cards for that reason, the beautiful colors and imagery. I do find that my aging eyes see them as a bit busy. I pull just one card for a personal daily reading and still use Hanson-Roberts for reading cards for others.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's pretty cool and realistic, I would recommend it to a kid who wants a pet. It has a zebra for sale too I think
B00BESCJII|3.0|Not exactly what I thought it was going to be like, but still was a good movie overall and entertained me for 2 hours.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|It's really good in using with English. However, to use with the other languages it doesn't always predict the right one.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I was compelled by the characters and their circumstances. It is based on actual events and made you  The writing transported you to caring about the children. We all know some of them in modern day
B000OXHRRC|3.0|The movie had its cute moments but tended to drag on some in parts. The characters were not linked together well so it was a little disjointed to me.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|We LOVE this movie, and adore when my son sings &#34;How Bad Can I Be?&#34;  The message is easy for kids to relate to, and the music is catchy and fun.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|It is a great app. The way it displays the event easy to follow. I would recommend my friends about it
B000X2H8G4|5.0|Bought this device to aid in communication with a person in a nursing home who has had his hearing aid misplaced.  It is amazing, we now get answers to our questions!  Conversations are two sided now!  He was missing everything we said and now he hears us again.  Really changes things for the better.
B003VANOFY|5.0|The best headphones one can own! It is amazingly light and the sound is amazing. It is a must have!
1616550414|5.0|Ever since Windwaker was released I've always wondered how the Zelda universe got to be covered in water. This book explains all the chronology questions I've had for the series so far. Although half of the pages are dedicated to Skyward Sword development material and drawings. The other half is the chonology and then more images from past game development. I would have loved to hear personal stories from Miyamoto and Kondo and the likes, but this is great.
1935597760|5.0|Yes, I would call this work \\"exquisite\\". From the beginning, I was captivated by Christina McKenna's use of the English language and the Irish dialect. Her character development is second to none and the story riveting. I borrowed it on my Kindle via Amazon Prime and now will seek to purchase a hard copy: I like it that much and want it in my library.<br /><br />I am American of British Isles extraction and cannot judge how exact her replication of Northern Ireland country speech of that time may be, but from my travel experience it rings true. I would not criticize it as other reviewers have.<br /><br />Ms. McKenna has written about some very typical lives; some parts are excruciating and some are lovely. She has a knack for injecting humor into the mundane. I find her writing to be both descriptive and spare. I would definitely not accuse her of overwriting.<br /><br />Now I strongly suspect that literary critics, those writing about literature and teaching it at the university level, are lemmings for the most part, choosing certain (mostly male) authors to lionize - and that once one is \\"chosen\\" everyone else in the tribe, uh, jumps on the bandwagon. Despite that, I am hoping that this author will receive the recognition she deserves, as students could learn a great deal from her skill with words and in portrayal of time and place.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My wife is an Angry Bird addict now.  This one is a lot of fun, only I can't get her away from the tablet now.  She's always in a fowl mood.  Get it?  &#34;Fowl&#34; mood!  HAHAHAHA!<br /><br />I'm sorry for that.  We really do love these games, though.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Good Story, well-plotted, intelligently written.  But the characters!!!  The are developed so well and so human.  You find yourself caring about them, almost as friends.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|A new story every episode but also a ongoing story line that is fun to try and predict. We enjoy the series very much.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I have had several big fish games and like them all..I'd an okay puzzle. Nice puzzle structure. Not much to say other than i want a sandwich
B0034DGPEU|5.0|From page one, the emotional journey was fast, furious and very believable.  can't wait for her next believable fiction to hold my interest.
B009AMANBA|5.0|A great account of the nation's loss of a President, and the evil of slavery that continues to this day in the Democrat Party with their Welfare State. This tyranny is not just for blacks! This party's demand is for full control over We the People. This is the same issue that drove the Civil War, States rights, and a demand for slavery. Today the government expects slavery of the populace.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This app is a function no alarm clock should lack. I use it to help plan my day, week, or weekend. Outstanding.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|Steinbeck was a genius in letting us see through the eyes of the migrant how life was affected by the dust bowl and the greed of the land owners.  The story is alive.! and by the way very pertinent today.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|verry challenging but fun. It is zoo hard sometimes u need to use an online cheat video which I used for about. 3 of them please buy this app it rocks
B00008J2PG|5.0|This is a great version of the story of the struggle between the Church and a ruthless tyranny.<br /><br />It reminds me so much of Schindler's List.
B009CG25JM|5.0|Great music, a great story, and terrific acting.  It really puts you right into the late 50's.  It is surprising that Paul LeMat (John) did not have much of an acting career after this.  He was one of the best.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|One of the best shows on tv.  Season 2 was a total roller coaster of emotions. Cannot wait for the next season.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|The reason this book is so compelling,along with the rest of the series,is because of the world(For me),and because it has an excellent writer and writing style.The plot is dynamic,and if something would be pursued for to long it jumps to a different POV.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I saw this title on a high school reading list.  It sounded interesting.  It contained history, mystery & adventure.  The way the story switched from the present to the past and back again made it very enjoyable.  I  am looking forward to reading the sequel.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Finally broke down and bought all 3 seasons for my design studio. I can just start the DVD's and it feels like I have old friends chatting in the background while I am working. Love it!!! So glad I purchased the set!
B00000DHR0|5.0|i have seen celion dion 3 times in las vegas. she was great every time and different.i love this cd.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|This app plays videos that you can find on youtube from lohanthony to glozell,  but it stops like every twenty five seconds in the video and has to load.  Its kind of annoying when it pauses.  If this gets fixed that would be awesome.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It was an interesting overlapping time line journey. It makes you think how your own interactions can ripple through other lives.
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|Every song is wonderful...smooth R&B music.  Not only is the beat/music good but the lyrics tell a story.  Glad Joe is back.
B005H9B44A|5.0|This is one my fav super hero movies! i Loved this movie! Entertaining from beginning to end! Two thumbs up!
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|This emoji game is good and very addictive I love playing it. It's also challenging in a way. Everyone that uses emojis should get it.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Rose was quirky and very relatable. I loved her progress from repressed to free spirit. The only downer was that I had read the description for the next book first so some of Joe's mystery was revealed. I think it would have been much more suspenseful if I didn't already know Joe's role in the story.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I grew up with this movie, and I've been in love with it since I first saw it way back when. Just about everything was done exactly right; the casting was perfect, the acting was great, the comedy was hilarious but not overdone, the script and directing and even the music choices were all spot on. I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it, and all kids. Yes, there are a few swear words used and some typical young teen \\"boy\\" humor, but I wouldn't consider that a problem for child viewers. Believe me, they hear way worse listening to the real life teens and adults in this world.<br /><br />This movie is about friendship and hope in the face of disaster. It's about optimism and the power of determination and courage, regardless of age. It encourages us to believe that nothing is impossible, the miracles can happen, and that fortune favors the bold. An all around feel-good family friendly and funny movie that still, after all these years, counts among my top 5 favorite movies ever. Want to remember what it was like to be a kid? This is the movie.
B000HKYOK0|4.0|Most of them are great the sound quality is lacking in number 13 and 21 but generally fair. The picture looks good and the stories speak for themselves. I watched them on my Prime time promo and now I am debating buying the whole first series it is that good. Worth it is  a classic.
1416972250|5.0|This serious of books are so good. My Grand Daughter told me to read them and I could not put down the first book. Had to order all five. These books pull you right in and you can't wait to see what is going to happen next.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Enjoyed playing! I look forward to checking out more games by G5. Only complaint is that some of the items to find are tiny and very difficult to see on a kindle screen.
B00E0MCYPS|1.0|I just picked up the game while it was on Amazon's free app of the day and unloaded it a few mins later.  The steering is terrible at best.  The game doesn't register slight tilts to just correct the car so giving it a little more of a tilt the car tries to do donuts. At one point I was following one of the cars and the game told me wrong way.  Huh?!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Good story... good production. I rarely buy movies, but this one was too intriguing. Well spent. I have enjoyed every episode.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|These guys are always on tour and I've seen them countless times. They have a great overall sound with some awesome harmonies and a good solid punch where needed.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Amazing I Love The Book! I Can't Wait To See The Second Movie It Was Just Amazing! I Love It!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|how do i get the string cut so that the pill can go down?<br /><br />when the goo gets close to the pill they pop.<br /><br />plz give answers
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This calendar does everything I. need it to do and wirelessly connects with my computer with changes.  I do wish it had the option of tasks for each month rather than one task section.  (This is how I used to keep track of birthdays, etc.  I can make it work for me, though.  I just have to remember to check it at the beginning of each month. The repeating events works well with several widgets to choose from.  This is definitely my new planner.
B005DJREJS|4.0|This is a bit amusing. Its like watching a trainwreck, you cant turn away. The main character takes all the mishaps in stride with an acceptance that i sure dont remember having as a child!
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|There are weird plot holes throughout this flick. Sure, it's a move about magic and some suspension of disbelief is required here - but, it just didn't work very well. All of the leads were totally typecast. The twist ending was a bit of a let down with no real pay off. I didn't buy it at all.  I loved the set design - especially the stuff shot in New Orleans. Overall, it was OK.
B000CNE092|5.0|I loved this movie so much when I was a kid, and when I got it, I literally watched it every day for about a week straight. Amazing movie!! And it's 20th Century Fox, people, not Disney!
B004P8A7J2|5.0|Amazing film that shows the horrors of drug abuse and makes me feel real gut hurting emotions for the main characters
B00EEN7CAK|5.0|I so enjoy the tone of Sofia Coppala's movies. It's difficult to describe, but it's sort of like being in a dream - detached, but present. This story is told with no judgment or in-depth look as to what motivates these vacuous, celeb-obsessed teenagers. I found that delightfully ironic, considering its director and star are in a incredibly unique position to criticize consumerism, celebrity culture, social media, fame and fashion. Speaking of the star, Emma Watson was so much fun to watch - she really nailed this part to the wall.  I loved it.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I have watched this over and over again! if you don't mind the blood and violence, a must see! andy was great in this role.
1582701709|3.0|I found this book informative and certainly could have potentiality when applied, so far I haven't been able to make the information and steps personal. I'm open to it's possibility.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|Dear Baz: If the choice to use bloated, wealthy, bored, self-important pop stars on the soundtrack was to draw a parallel to the same traits found in the film's characters, then bravo! You are a genius.  If, like I suspect,  it was a gimmick to play on some ill-conceived post-modern juxtaposition, then you failed supremely. Sorry dude, it sucked.
B001VU1NJ0|3.0|I had heard of this movie years ago and since I grew up in the Boston area I thought I would watch it.  I couldn't get into it, it is really a guy movie, I didn't finish it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Everyone wants a Christen and Ana... Be one have one or just experience one!!!! Loved it.. Puts spark where it should be!!!
B009AY04A8|4.0|I love hidden object games,,I would have given it 5 stars but when you enlarge the scene on my kindle and you are trying to move the lantern around it sometimes gives you a penalty for random tapping when you are not doing this.,you are only trying to move the light around..I have not finished the game yet but so far I do like it.
B000HZHBIM|4.0|I am a Star Trek fan of the TV version.  I enjoyed this movie and have seen it a few times.  It is entertaining and makes you wonder what might be possible in the future.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Put off reading any of them for a long time.. Was thinking it was just high class porn.. How wrong.. Beautifully done..I would read anything EL James wrote because of her style. She can take you places you have never been.. Might not want to stay be really nice to visit!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE OTHER RUNNING GAMES 5 Stars!!!! A++++ Get the Game And You'll love it to!!!!!! GET IT!!!!
B0026Q8EWW|4.0|This movie was not familiar to me so I decided to watch it to see what it was about.  I ended up enjoying it very much.  It is about a young lawyer who takes on an insurance company to get benefits for one of their insured people who was denied coverage.  It is a learning experience about insurance companies and their practices.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Keep an open mind with any book you read.. It takes all kinds to make the world and we each make our own...
B002TLSSXO|5.0|I really love these utensils. They are great sizes, easy to clean, and best of all - keep the mess off the counter!
B007L5LD9O|2.0|It didn't grab my attention so I didn't watch it.  It didn't seem to be something that I would like to watch.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Awesome game.  Very addicting.  Highly recommended to anyone.  Many levels that make it a constant challenge and a lot of fun to play.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|I do not understand it. There are not enough people on this yet to make it fun. It didn't have the same effect as the traditional game.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is game with beautiful graphics. My granddaughter loves it too. She was convinced that in the future she wants to be a veterinarian.Poo
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Highly recommended...if you're reading reviews about this movie...then this one is for you...I liked this better then the Stallone version...Karl Urban is excellent in any project he is cast in...has all the attributes of truly good entertainment, violence, gore and suttle whit...jo'c
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|It is Addicting and there is variety within the game. The music that plays is soothing to listen to.  :)
B009LDMJBU|5.0|I absolutely loved this CD by Eros and have thoroughly enjoyed his CDs for years even though I don't speak much Italian.  I especially liked his duet with Nichole Scherzinger.  I think that is the best of the best.  Keep it coming Eros...
B004DM0UII|5.0|I am sure there are a million apps like this,  but this one stands with distinction. I got it for free from Amazon, but think it was worth paying for. Enjoying it now as I write this<br />post.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|After watching it many times throughout the years, I still think this movie is awesome. The depiction of the gladiators and Rome back then is pretty good as well. Love the acting, and the movie was well made.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|This is sort of a  version of &#34;Upstairs,Downstairs&#34; taking place in a latter time period.  This show is a great reflection of higher quality programming that the British television truly excels at.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Great epic fantasy. I did not want it to end and I will read it once more before the. 2nd installment comes out.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This was the first &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; I've read and am now on number 4 after reading 2 and 3.  And, yes, I plan to read them all.
0425263924|5.0|This is an amazing series by Sylvia Day, and I'm looking forward to purchasing her next book in the Crossfire Series!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app.  I use it often to sleep or meditate. The sounds are varied enough for anyone's taste. I love the fact I can layer sounds and change volume levels for each individual sound as well as the volume for the entire ensemble. There is something for everyone here. Whether you are looking for white noise, nighttime sounds or children laughing and playing, this app has it.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|One of those books you will have in your mind forever.  Difficult to follow at times, but that only added to the intrigue.  Appalling and frightening to think people may actually live this way. A masterful story.  Rather depressing but highly recommend.
B0035JNTA6|1.0|I cannot believe how dumb this movie was. The great cast had no plot, no writing, no movie, to work with.
B008602KQI|3.0|The Hunger Games is pretty much a remake of The Running Man (1987) which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger. It would've been better if the rich cast did not wear those horrible 1700's costumes. I give it a three because it did keep me watching it somewhat. I only fast forwarded to the good parts.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonderful story for all ages! Happy, but heartbreaking at times. My middle school son enjoyed it just as much as I, the mother of a child with some special needs. An easy read and well worth the time!
B00005JSGK|5.0|I love safaris and John Wayne so this was a natural love movie for me.  The cast was great together.  The humor added also to a great story line.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|A classic collection of the classic!  If you follow it, or want a n intro to the series, this is where to start.
B007SGM084|5.0|Whew!!!  This first book was . . . . wow!  The second book was a tad tamer and the third one was expected.  Loved it!
B0021L8V0M|5.0|I like Angelina Jolie and I love action movies.  This one had a lot of mystery to it as well which kept me on my seat trying to figure it out
B00499NHLC|5.0|A new interpretation of the original. Each episode refers back to original story. Cumberbatch is great! So is the reset of the cast.
B009LQKHIO|3.0|This author has problems with tenses, leaving out words, and using the correct word at times (ie 'shuttered' for 'shuddered').  If you are willing to wade through that and read slowly to figure out some sentences, she does develop her characters well and you can easily visusalize people and places from her writing.  She desperately needs a very English-literate editor for her written word.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I love all the actors in this movie.  It was great to be able to see them all in ONE movie together.  The action is great.  And they make the out of the ordinary seem as ordinary and nothing special in ones life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like that they change the location every month. It is fun to play and is a great stress reliever.  My daughter and I compete against each other.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I never tire of watching the antics of Sheldon and the rest of the big bang crew.. They are a laugh a minute and buying this 3rd season of their show has not been a waste of money.. I highly recommend purchasing this  3rd season of their show. You willl not be disappointed.
B000MXPE7O|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater and decided I wanted to have it to watch later to try to figure some of it out, but I have not had time to do so yet
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Shopping at your fingertips has never been so easy and convenient. I like Amazon for it's in depth reviews on products. Also, being able to read other customer's reviews provides an unbiased opinion of products sold on Amazon.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I never tire of watching the antics of Sheldon and the rest of the big bang crew.. They are a laugh a minute and buying this 2nd season of their show has not been a waste of money.. I highly recommend purchasing this 2nd season of their show. You will not be disappointed.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|I love Morgan Freeman. He did a great job in portraying Mandela.  It helped to bring to life all the hardships that he endured and the fact that all he endured did bring about change in his country for the good.  Matt Damon was great as well.  It is hard to believe all that was accomplished was done thru soccer.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|This show is great! I'm a fan of, &#34;The Vampire Diaries,&#34; and came across this show over the Summer, and glad that I did. It's definitely worth checking out if you think you'd be interested in it by just reading the title!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|A very realistic accounting of  staying alive in prison.... Very interesting and a real page turner....I felt like this would help anyone who was thinking about getting into illegal activities.
B001PA0FFO|4.0|The acting was great and I like both the main character actors.  However, it does show how suspicions can destroy ones life and this movie never gives a hint if the Nun's doubts about the priest were actually true.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I'm surprised by the good reviews! I installed the application and it crashed 4 times. Re installed, the application wouldn't open. Now, thus may be nectar I have the Samsung Galaxy S3, but I've not had many problems with applications.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book so much! COULDN'T  stop reading,so I finished it in like three days. Now I'm sad it's over.
B002VECM6S|5.0|The acting of Sandra Bullock was  exceptional and you know it really had an impact on her life as she adopted a little AfricanAmerican boy after this movie.  I had racisim and this real life story offers hope and Christian love as it should be.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good from beginning to end. You won't want to put it down. A great series. You must read them all
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I play this game to relax.  It is a fun way to kill time and to put me to sleep at night.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|I loved the movie as I saw it in the theater and just wanted to have one to watch sometime in the future.
B00A285OOW|5.0|This book is easy to read - I found it hard to put down..  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction.
B0019IIPXQ|4.0|I had not heard of this movie.  Always am alerted by friends, etc. about &#34;Alien&#34; type movies and I think another reason it slipped by me, is that I have never seen a Vin Diesel movie.  I'm just not into fast cars, etc..  Totally loved this movie and he just might be my new movie hero.  I ended up buying both movies.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I liked this greatly as it showed royalty as regular people.  However, of course they did age to becoming snobs.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game cause it rules...lol<br />Also my daughter and nephew love it and wont stay off this game.
B0034GK7DM|5.0|Music is great but the jewel case was broken when I received it.<br />I had to replace it with another one.
B00006FM77|5.0|The energy of this great band in it's original lineup leaves one gasping for air!  Robert Lamm said in their Behind the Music episode that Chicago lost it's soul when Terry Kath passed in Jan. 1978.  Lamm, Kath and Cetera vocals are not overdubbed, so this project is live and untouched.  Keep in mind the technology available in 1971 for multi-track recording.  This is a must have for any Chicago fan.
B004X80QNG|1.0|I am rather disappointed with this app. A nice, simple and working way is to put everything you planned on that day and then if lasting tell what day it ends. But no all they do is make this list that takes so much longer to plan. Summary; RIP OFF
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Since they reset my entire game. Lost everything...items in room, coins, upgrades. I would've given it a 0, but I had to give it a 1.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|The Facebook app works great,  except it doesn't have a nice view on the Kindle Fire tablet. On the Kindle Fire the text and images are too small.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|How do you get coins? I have been wondering because I have been trying to do it but I can't. Is it even possible to get more  coins?????
B007XNAQL0|5.0|I've always like Peter. The video is a edited mix of concerts apparently because a lot of video did not match the audio. It is a great work of art nonetheless.
B008X9Z37A|3.0|This cheap and utilitarian and is good for my way of thinking. I do not want anything flashy and call attention to the device.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|DAVID Tennant is brilliant.The supporting cast is amazing.This is in every aspect a great show. I wish there were more like this
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The last show of season three without giving it away for some was such a shock. I only hope it is not what it seems as this character was one of my favorites.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I liked this movie a lot more than I thought I would. I wanted to see it in theaters, but didn't get a chance to. Kind of reminds me of an 80s movie but with better special effects. If you like fright night and weird science youll probably like this.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Reminiscent of &#34;The Help&#34; - this is an excellent book!  The various voices, and the capacity to look at the experience of the slave and the Southern aristocracy with shared empathy made it very real.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam's book came at a time in my life when I was already entertaining suicidal thoughts. That was 2 days ago. Today I've lost count on the dozens of miracles that have  happened since I began doing the experiments in her book that I could hardly remember how my depression had almost choked me to death. It feels like I've received a new set of eyes and my spiritual relationship with myself and the Almighty has never been better. I'm teaching the paradigm shifts in this book to my 14-year old so he doesn't have to suffer the same delusions I've  been convincing myself of all these years! Also sharing my experiences with the solo parent support group I'm facilitating and ask them to buy your book. Thank you so much Pam!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love this series and I wish I had caught it on tv when it was first broadcasted and now I am dreading the end.  I love a story with continuous characters but several plots.  No gore, no bloody corpses.  Yeah.
B00B52F278|5.0|Came as soon as it was made available. They gave me the lower rate since price went down. this is great series too bad it had to end.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Father and Son take on the world.  Got to love the McClain family, but don't mess with them unless you have a death wish.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I usually don't like &#34;period&#34; pieces but this show is awesome. The characters are interesting, funny and engaging. This show could run on non PBS networks and be amazingly successful. The addition of Shirley McClaine this season was a great choice.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|I was sad to see it end but the ending at least wrapped it all up.  Well worth the watch.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|I was fascinated by this movie when I first saw it in the early sixties and amazed how well it still holds up today. It inspired many SiFi movies and series including Star Trek.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|It is only the beginning of journey but it draws you in for more.  Much like the Lord of the Rings nothing is lacking in story or visuals.
0385523394|3.0|I watched the series on Netflix, and I absolutely loved it. I was thrilled to learn that there was a memoir that the series was based on. I found the memoir to be extremely different from the TV show. Maybe if I had read this first I might have been more impressed. But while there are some similar characters, the TV show is a lot more interesting and dramatic. This is a rare instance of a TV series/film trumping the book. Overall, I was underwhelmed.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The story keeps unfolding and more and more twists and turns can't wait for the next book.  I am very invested to this series of books.
1439156816|5.0|While I like Stephen King's fiction, my favorite of his books is On Writing. As a writer, I appreciate reading about the struggle that such a superstar writer had to face in his early career. When he hit the jackpot with Carrie, I cried.<br /><br />His advice for young writers is top notch. My writing completely changed after reading this book for the first time (back in 2002). I use a lot less adverbs -- that's for sure! If you're a writer and you haven't read this book, what are you waiting for? It's fantastic.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|Not Bruce Campbell but it will work.  I still prefer the originals but they did switch it up a bit.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|This book taught me so much about myself.  After each chapter I was excited to test out the ideas.  Highly recommended this book!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Was very well done.  Story, action and special effects.  The trailers do not give away near as much as you would think worth the watch.
B000HZCZZ6|5.0|Star Trek is always a treat! I actually took the opportunity to watch the entire series and enjoyed every moment of it :-)
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love this game but wish u could earn more bingo chips. Some games cost a lot of chips so you can only play a few games
B000I3UMLQ|5.0|Star Trek is always a treat! I actually took the opportunity to watch the entire series and enjoyed every moment of it :-)
B004X75RK4|5.0|Funny, sassy, sweet, well-cast and acted. This one is a  classic for date night/anytime you're in the mood for a rom-com. Ryan Reynolds's snarky sarcasm should really be mentioned in the credits, because it is the third costar for the first half of the movie.
B000HZGNDG|5.0|Star Trek is always a treat! I actually took the opportunity to watch the entire series and enjoyed every moment of it :-)
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great game. Can't wait for more like it. My favourite type of game is hidden object and every day this game has something new.
B000HZGNEU|5.0|Star Trek is always a treat! I actually took the opportunity to watch the entire series and enjoyed every moment of it :-)
B004EPZ08O|5.0|The complete series was great to have, just have to pace yourself so you don't watch them all at once! Wish there were more.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is fun &amp; addictive - building animal families and designing your own village. The only problem I've had is accidentally buying animals or landscape with nuts when only &quot;window shopping.&quot;
B004EPZ070|5.0|How many times have I watched this? ---  Over and over and over.<br />The entire cast is great, -- a terrific love story between Colin Egglesfield and Jennifer Goodwin.<br />You hate to see it end.  A great Movie!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Mainly it's based on a couple of lies that undermine the whole. This writer was in an induced pharmacologically controlled coma. Period.
0525478817|5.0|So, I'm late to the party on this one, having known about this amazing book for a while, but not getting to it. Until now. And, I'm glad that I did because it is - as others, including the critics and award-givers have said - an amazing portrait of illness. It is truly amazing to me how Mr. Green is able to inhabit the mind and body of a young woman, a woman who has foresight and consciousness about herself, and yet one who - for all her wisdom and remarks - is still very young. I was most taken by the banter between Hazel and Gus, and it reminded me of what it was like to be a teenager (albeit, perhaps not as clever or wise as either of them).<br /><br />But, the portrait that Mr. Green has painted of the two of them, their relationship with each other, and Hazel's with her parents is really great. Typing this, I can still hear the characters, and most of them are telling me that I'm being far to trite, but I'll leave the wonderful dialog to Mr. Green.<br /><br />I only hope that unlike the sad author Van Houten, Mr. Green finds a way to continue with his writing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Of course I love it it's the original minecraft so of course I'm putting 5 STARS would put 1,000,000,000 stars<br /> if I could another awesome game picked<br /> by Bella by Bella  EPIC GAME GET<br /> YOUR MINE ON
B008JFUPK8|4.0|I enjoyed the film.  Great visuals, decent storyline.  Cavill doesn't have much to say, Crowe steals the film and Zod is off the chain awesome as the nutjob villain.  SUPERMAN is tricky to get right, they did a good job here but I still think there's room for FUN instead of all this po-faced seriousness we're getting so much of.  I think that's why AVENGERS worked so well because it was FUN and BATMAN was great because it was essentially three crime movies just with Batman.  They need to find a coherent style for SUPERMAN and they haven't found it yet.  But, this was a good film.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|AWESOME GAME IT INVOLVES DRAGINS OF COURSE IT IS GOING TO BE AWESOME ANOTHER ONE OF MY FAVORITES HOPE U GET IT !!!! Another one of Bella' s favorites by Bella
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|My husband and I rented this movie last night for a nice night in.  We love SciFi and action movies.  Oblivion left us sorely wanting.  The plot was convoluted with obvious inconsistencies and unfortunately far from believable even with the suspended disbelief that is a given with most SciFi. The action was fine. The acting was passable. The effects were above average. But sadly as a whole the movie was maybe a C+. I'm sad we spent the money on the rental.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like it because I do he he and Lawson is fun and cats vs dogs and I love cats
B004CFBMRY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book - makes you think outside the square - not at all what I expected but a nice surprise. Recommended for anyone who enjoys sport, and in particular of course running.
B004LROUNG|4.0|I loved the characters in the book and setting in Chicago(my favorite city to visit) sold me from the beginning. Everything else was kinda predictable.
B007FXLZ9K|3.0|\\"The controversial drama, Shame, directed by Steve McQueen, is one of the rare films these days that has received an NC-17 rating solely based on the sex and nudity depicted. Much to surprise and years of experience watching films, the content while frank and mature is treated with responsibility and a sense of melancholy not found in many R-rated films for that matter. Shame's treatment of human functions and crude material is not the same as The Hangover, Freddy Got Fingered, or Scary Movie, for example.<br /><br />Aside from that acknowledgment, the story examines Brandon, a loner in New York conflicted with his own perverted vices which in turn get worse as he becomes more alienated with his estranged sister who is a singer. The film's examination of the man is a one of sorrow and frustration often taking very extended scenes of him running down the city, looking down being quiet, or talking and chatting to sexual encounters he meets in the town.<br /><br />The way McQueen makes you approach the subject did certainly break a few corners of patience with audiences but for what it is, it did stood out much in the same way that Trainspotting or Requiem for a Dream did by glimpsing on addiction in itself (which is a bigger theme here) and its problems. The cinematography and music scheme here are responsibly done and very minimalistic yet brooding for what it is that you almost think is this man really worth your time to watch or is just an object?<br /><br />As a whole, Shame is not a very good film as it is but it is a prolonged and graphic example of how human decisions and lack of self-control can leave a trail of multiple issues not asked for. Thankfully, the film was used as a talking piece for many addiction committees and organizations across the United States which has rendered the scary, horrific, mysterious NC-17 to feel more like an R (in which the film could have earned if, by MPAA rule, trimmed any sight of nudity or focus of protracted action). Don't watch this on a sunny day but as a film studies case.watch this on a sunny day but as a film studies case.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|My Mom Kimberly Kirchoff  is really mean and I hate her when she is really mean. I love her when she is not mean
B00004XMTJ|5.0|Loved the costumes, music and dancing.  Almost like seeing it at the theater.  Easy to see why it ran for so long on stage.
B00DRGQZRG|5.0|Wow, I've just finished listening to this for the first time and I'm quite impressed.  In name, this is a Dave Holland album, but it could be the work of any of the four talented musicians, or just fall under the band name Prism.  I've been a huge fan of Holland for years, and outside of Mingus he is my favorite on the bass.  The more I hear of Craig Taborn the more I'm amazed and he is shooting up my list of favorites on the keyboard.  Quite frankly, Eric Harland is my favorite drummer, he is simply amazing, combining propulsion, inventive fills and a shape-shifting sense of time while never calling undue attention to himself, hw takes the magic of Tony Williams into new lands.  I'm only somewhat familiar with Kevein Eubanks, but his performace here keeps pace and sometimes outshines the aforementioned musicians.  Did I say i was impressed?<br /><br />This is more of a fusion album than Holland has been involved in for quite a long time.  The musics swings, funks it up and rocks pretty hard.  All four musicians contribute songs and the music covers a wide spectrum from the angular THE TRUE MEANING OF DETERMINATION to the churchy feel of CHOIR, to the lucid THE COLOR OF IRIS, to the blissful closing BREATHE. I am looking forward to more in depth listening to this fine release.  Yep, impressive
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Second season almost better than the first.  Went into more depth of all the characters.  Makes it even harder to wait for Season 3
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|This is a fantastic FAOTD. Get it!<br /><br />Runs perfectly on a GS4; tilt controls are solid, but could use a sensitivity setting. Physics are remarkably good. Very real. Enough so that not being able to apply partial throttle is a problem - I'd love to see three buttons for 1/3 - 2/3 - full throttle.<br /><br />Win the first 3 races in the campaign to get to the second track to see what this game is really about. Second track is pretty, hard, and fun.<br /><br />Hint: turn off auto-accelerate. Coasting is different from braking.<br /><br />Really fantastic work by the developer on this one!
B0045HCJQW|4.0|Another screwball comedy.  Excellent cast, mildly amusing story.  Hard not to like a film with both Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart.
B001KWZ796|5.0|I have watched this movie at least 10 times and it always wams my heart every time. Love really can conquer all.
1250006341|5.0|Really a very interesting read.  Lots of behind the scenes information as well as many photos.  Learned a lot about life in that time period as it affects both &#34;upstairs&#34; and &#34;downstairs&#34;
B008JFUUQ2|4.0|Ok, I love, love this movie.  Funniest movie I've seen in years.  My only problem is with the extras.  On HBO, they showed this great documentary of them making the movie.  They showed them learning the dances and interacting with each other and the people behind the scenes such as make-up and choreographers.  Why was this not on the extras section?  They have a VERY lame compilation of fans and a few of the actors singing Kelly Clarkson's, &#34;Since You've Been Gone&#34;.  It was poorly done and really irritating.  Most of the extra's had to do with the character Benji.  Come on!  They do have a extra about the burrito scene, but it's really not the interesting.  Great movie, but don't buy for the extra's.
B008469DGY|4.0|Clip your fingernails, Butter your finger and Flick away! - This is one interesting game. Yeah it uses golf ball that you flick using your finger but it does not follow the rules of the GOLF. This is merely one flick attempt of the ball to a target. It is purely a fun flick, swipe and try your luck at a given target kinda game. If the ball drops into the target range you get points and that allows you to advance into other levels also unlocks additional levels.<br /><br />It is purely entertaining for 99c which you can play for hours, Graphics and flying golf ball physics are top notch but it would have been even better if it were like real GOLF game.<br /><br />Four stars from me.
B00EV4EUT8|3.0|This movie certainly captures the spirit of a country going from open oppression of blacks to having a black President in a single generation. And it reminds us that our current politics of 2013 are by no means the most divisive in recent history.<br /><br />This is meant to be a family movie, and while some of the vivid civil rights scenes are shocking, the brutality of the Civil Rights era was far worse. For example, no pictures of little kids being spat on, no teens blown up in churches. (Someday, someone will have the guts to do a real movie about the freedom riders and what it took to break the back of segregation, but it will be too violent and disturbing to get the ratings this movie has.)<br /><br />For the many boomers old enough to remember all these events first hand, it will be a fast-forward run through recent history, like reading a scrapbook. One vignette of this, a snapshot of that. It will make them feel great. For kids who didn't live through this, though, I wonder if this format will work. Will they even know who LBJ was, or why he'd be portrayed on a toilet? [A needless scene IMO].<br /><br />I gave this movie only three stars despite solid performances because it's too pat, too sanitized, everything is too much at arms length.  It's a good attempt at describing what happened in that time period, but it doesn't really explain why or how it happened. That requires great art. This is a good movie, but not great art.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Enjoy playing this game. I like the levels in this game.  It makes the game more interesting. Love the groundhog
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I love &#34;Star Trek&#34; and have since the William Shatner series started. I'm happy that the franchise continues. I will watch the movies until no more are made.
B000W8HC8I|5.0|Incredible cant wait for the movie, it heeps you interested since page 1 all the way to the end. Buy it
B00EDF43MY|5.0|I downloaded Dr Panda Airport as a free app because I am using my Kindle as bribe to encourage the Hispanic 8 yr old next door to read English. She loves it! She has never been to an airport or flown. The animals are very cute and she easily navigated the game on her own. It is one of her favorite rewards after reading.
140006922X|5.0|Gave great insight into the Palestine of 2000 years ago and built a case for his representation of Jesus&#34; motives and actions.
B003LQ3YXU|3.0|The premise starts out hokey, then degrades to the somewhat ridiculous.  Not sure it is worth the time to watch.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|You will be hooked if you watch Season 1.  I can't wait to see future seasons and will be excited to see them on Prime instant video.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is a well written show with interesting characterization. The choice of actors and the quality of acting make it a great show.
B004UOE7VA|5.0|I really like this album and have been listening to it everyday sadly there is 2 versions for the song son of flynn and both are ok remixes but would have prefered a remix of solar sailer.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very enjoyable, good character development.  Author didn't make you wait too long to find out the secret and the resuling repercussions.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|It looks great, and feels solid.  I'm pleased with this purchase, as I have been with all of the other Bruder toys.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I love it! its &#34;deeper&#34; than the past on the tasks that need to be resolved...its not all a clear cut path to HOW they can resolve the problems...once they disover them that is.. its not as though they can &#34;find the bad guy and kill it&#34; - its bigger then that..the writters gave them multiple issues that carry through the season, all of which are VERY important and not a simple hunt and kill solution.<br />the friction between Sam and Dean is more intense, while that does add to the story, I am not a fan of the brothers fighting.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I haven't read a non romance novel in a little over 2 years (and I average about 5 books a week so that's a lot of love) I told myself that it was time for a change so I looked for different genre. I chose this book completely at random and can I say that I just could not put it down! At every turn something unexpected occurred that I didn't see coming (unlike my romance novels) I highly recommend this book and I can't wait to start reading others by Howey
B000P0J09C|5.0|Been wanting to watch this movie for awhile, I am glad that I added this movie to my collection. My boyfriend is in love with this movie.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|i love my little pony! i am absolutely ubsessed. this game is just as awesome as the show. try it.
6304711905|1.0|This was not like the version I have seen before. Did not enjoy watching this movie. I gave the movie to a friend and they stated the same as me.
B002RI9ZQ8|4.0|Its a good read, even though most of the times you can gauge what's going to happen next. Nice story for a hollywood flick though.
0767817710|4.0|The quick and the dead was a great movie to watch with friends. More than I expected. Will watch again in the future.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|I love this movie! I really don't understand why so many people gave poor reviews, or what y'all were expecting. You all have become so jaded, I guess, to the point of being overly critical. This movie held our interest, and wasn't predictable at all. Costumes, effects, and acting were all just perfect. I don't typically care for remakes or prequels.  I hated the new versions of Alice and wonderland and Charlie and the chocolate factory, but my daughter and I thought this movie was very good and magical!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This is a great game for my 4 year old. The items are all easy to pick and use. My 2 year old can even play mostly successfully. The only thing they have trouble with from time to time is changing pages on the game, but that might just be because they are playing on a phone rather than a tablet.
B00DW5IM9Q|4.0|The 35 tracks on this two disk set include alternate versions of nine songs that were released on [[ASIN:B005F9TQ9C Self Portrait]] (1970); eight that were included on [[ASIN:B001SF8G1Q New Morning]] (also 1970); two from [[ASIN:B00028HODG Nashville Skyline]] (1969); three from the original [[ASIN:B0049KWALE Bootleg Series Vol. 1-3]] (1991); two tracks from the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival additional to the four on Self Portrait; one (When I Paint My Masterpiece) that was on [[ASIN:B002EBDMFS Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits, Volume 2]] (1971); one (Spanish is the Loving Tongue) from the generally underrated album, Dylan (1973), now re-packaged as [[ASIN:B000025YB0 A Fool Such As I]] (the last two are import only in the USA, and stupidly expensive); and nine - mostly a mix of covers and Bob Dylan arrangements of songs in the public domain - that we have not heard from Bob before. None are the exact same track as has previously been released.<br /><br />If that bare-bones analysis excites you, don't hesitate, buy the album. (Well, OK, you probably already did.) If it leaves you wondering if this collection of off-cuts and rejects is going to be worth the outlay, read on.<br /><br />Of the new songs, Columbia's use of Pretty Saro in publicity to sell the whole album was astute; it's a sweet, poignant song, sung by Bob with sensitivity. Several of the others are good too - and Working for a Guru, made with George Harrison, I suspect just for fun, will sell itself to George fans. For me, the winners are Tom Paxton's Annie's Going to Sing Her Song and Eddie Noack's These Hands. The latter celebrates the life of someone coming towards the end of their years; Bob, a young man when the recording was made, lifts it higher than Eddie did, or Hank Snow, or - dare I say it? - even Johnny Cash.<br /><br />Several tracks are as on Self Portrait but without overdubbing. The underlying performance of Little Sadie, In Search of Little Sadie, Belle Isle, All the Tired Horses, Copper Kettle and Days of '49 is therefore the same. Copper Kettle - a highlight of Self Portrait - may be better with the overdubbed strings. However, cutting the overdubs or, more likely, re-mixing, brings out the enormous energy of Bob's versions of both Days of '49 and Little Sadie. If I had never heard them before I would be knocked right off my feet. And just listen to David Bromberg's Doc Watsonesque guitar runs on Little Sadie!<br /><br />Al Kooper, famous for the organ chords on the original studio version of Like a Rolling Stone, has in recent years presented himself as musical director and arranger for Bob from Blonde on Blonde to New Morning. Now that credits are given track by track, we can see this was definitely so on New Morning and much of Self Portrait. With his string arrangements, Kooper almost seems to be bidding to be Bob's George Martin. Several tracks testify to his being a gifted pianist too.<br /><br />What a treat now to have alternate versions of so many New Morning songs - two of Went to See the Gypsy, one with additional words; If Not for You with a delicious solo violin part by an 'unknown' violinist (page 33 of the CD booklet pictures Doug Kershaw, but it looks like a Self Portrait session; I hope someone soon asks Doug if he played on this track); a Time Passes Slowly with George Harrison sharing vocal and guitar duties; Sign on the Window orchestrated in much the same way as Bob's set at the 1994 Unesco Great Music Experience in Japan; and, to crown all, a Big Brother and the Holding Company type treatment of Time Passes Slowly. Bob, however, is not Janis Joplin (and that's for the best).<br /><br />There's more yet, including the two new tracks from the Isle of Wight - the remix pulls out Highway 61 in a way that Self Portrait never did with Like a Rolling Stone - and a version of House Carpenter with Al Kooper on piano, David Bromberg on guitar and Bob on guitar and harmonica that leaves us in no doubt even in verse three, when the young woman is still proclaiming her allegiance to the House Carpenter, that this ship is on its way down to the Devil.<br /><br />And more, and more... This release should finally bury the myth that the years 1969 to 1971 were in any way either unproductive or uninspired for Bob.s still proclaiming her allegiance to the House Carpenter, that this ship is on its way down to the Devil.<br /><br />And more, and more... This release should finally bury the myth that the years 1969 to 1971 were in any way either unproductive or uninspired for Bob.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Great match game with plenty of play time.  Multiple levels, won't be bored<br />... .... ... ... ... have fun playing for hours and hours
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|this game is epic but it does take up a lot of space. but other than its great<br />gameloft has made another awesome game.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Did not think I would like this type of movie so didn't go see it in the theater but since I could see it for free I tried it. Was surprised as it was a pretty good movie.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. It's crazy how people's lives are connected. It made me ask \\"what would I do?\\" Overall, an excellent read.
B000JZ68GG|4.0|Simply a classic. One of young Jane Fonda's most memorable movies. Loved it then, love it now. Simply a classic
B00E0MCYPS|3.0|The description says the physics in the game are supposed to be \\"realistic and fun.\\" I'm afraid to report the physics are way more on the \\"fun side\\" then the realistic side (assuming fun is the opposite of realistic). I am a big fan of rally car racing games, especially Richard Burns. That game features extremely realistic physics, and this game does not.<br /><br />This is very much the typical smartphone arcade-style racer. The car floats about a central point, not four wheels. The \\"rally car\\" can't go more than half speed on grass, for some reason. Courses are video game style, not realistic. All that combined makes this a perfectly average 3-star game. If you like tilt-controlled (or optional button controls) smartphone racing games, you'll probably like this just fine.
B00008QSA5|3.0|Remembered having this in the sixties and wanted to hear it again.<br />Mike Bloomfield was very good for the time, really had done his blues homework. I love Stills but he is a much better guitar player today than he was back than. He just didn't have the chops for this kind of music.<br /><br />A good walk down Memory Lane for us old timers!

B009XIXVU6|3.0|The writing is beautiful. Too many characters that veered away from the main story. I was totally disinterested in the Greece story and<br />the doctor.  There were too many side stories and characters.It seem jumbled.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I recently acquired a Korg Triton Extreme keyboard, which I just simply adore, and which I play often and for extended periods of time.  I also recently invested in Logic Pro X, which, together with my Apogee Duet, has allowed me to build up songs, track by track.  So I decided that I needed a neutral, closed back headphone set for not only playing, but also for tracking and mixing (when I need to not disturb others).  I adore my Grado SR-225 headphones, but I have never considered them to be \\"neutral\\", and they are about as open as you can get.  So, I started my research into what are known as \\"Studio Monitor\\" headphones.<br /><br />My search revealed three main contenders in my price range: these headphones (the [[ASIN:B000AJIF4E Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone]], which are sonically identical to their predecessor, the [[ASIN:B00001WRSJ Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones with CCAW Voice Coil]]), the [[ASIN:B000ULAP4U Audio-Technica ATH-M50 Professional Studio Monitor Headphones with Coiled Cable]], and the [[ASIN:B000065BPB Sennheiser HD-280 PRO Headphones]].<br /><br />I learned pretty quickly that the 7506's are considered to be an industry standard, but also that some consider them to be somewhat unmusical, or \\"too analytical\\" or something along those lines.  Fine for cold hard calculating sound engineering stuff, but not great for LISTENING to (and enjoying) music.  So, this put me off the 7506's.<br /><br />As for the HD-280 Pro's, there were a number of reviews where the plastic of the headband cracked after just a few months and eventually broke, which concerned me, and many reviewers found them to be uncomfortable.  Of course, there are a LOT of reviews and these were still strong contenders.  However, I got a chance to listen to these locally, and didn't really like my first impression of them--although I would definitely require some extended listening (and break-in) before making any judgement of them.<br /><br />Moreover, it seemed that the Audio Technica ATH-M50's were by far the best reviewed headphones of the three, and were considered to be very musical.  In fact, according to HeadRoom, they are one of the top 10 headphones under $500.  Very impressive!  So, I decided on the M50's and ordered them from Amazon.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was definitely NOT impressed!  You can read my review for more details, but the short version of it is this: the M50's are not linear, have a hump in the bass at 100 Hz and another below that; have recessed mids; and sound muddy and dark to my ears.  I didn't like them at all, not for music appreciation, and certainly not for use as a \\"studio monitor\\", which they clearly are not.<br /><br />So, I returned the M50's and decided to try the industry standard, hoping that I wouldn't find them to be too harsh.  I was worrying they might be a little like the Yamaha NS10 studio monitors, which are infamous for not sounding great, BUT are really useful because, if you mix using them, and get the mix to sound decent on the NS10's, then the result will sound great on ANYTHING ELSE!  Or so the legend goes.  I've never heard NS10's.  But I was hoping that the 7506's wouldn't be like that.  And I was reassured by one review which specifically said that they weren't.  So I decided to give them a try.<br /><br />Boy am I happy that I did!  I wish I had gone for these first, and I would STRONGLY urge you to be skeptical of all the claims that these headphones are too analytical or that they are unmusical or any of that.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  These are wonderfully, brilliantly, clearly, and precisely musical, faithful, and enjoyable.  I stayed up late more than once because I kept wanting to hear how something else in my music library would sound through these headphones.  I LOVE that they are \\"analytical\\"--i.e. that they are NEUTRAL and even-handed.  It's SO NICE to listen to equipment that has an extended, and yet not boomy or exaggerated bass.  These headphones are really, really great for the price.  And they are very comfortable and have a good amount of isolation.  The isolation of the 7506's is not as good as the M50's, in my experience, and about the same as the 280's, although, to be fair, I only have a very limited amount of exposure to the 280's.<br /><br />In any case, there's a reason that these are an industry standard.  And they are not just popular with sound engineers; they are also renowned among musicians.  One of my friends even told me that there are albums where the V6 / 7506's are specifically mentioned as what the artist recommends that the record be listened to on.  Or something like that.  You can't go wrong with these headphones.  You really can't.  For any purpose.  And that reminds me, I should add that while I did do a lot of listening to these using my Duet as both DAC and amp, I found that the 7506's sounded really great straight out of my iPhone 4 (and out of my Korg Triton, too, of course).  The fact that these can be driven well by the iPhone definitely sets them apart and it's another huge plus for these headphones.  In my experience plenty of other \\"easy to drive\\" headphones still suffer when used straight out of something like an iPhone or iPod, but not the 7506's.<br /><br />Now, personally, I prefer open cans to closed (and sometimes I NEED to be able to hear my surroundings), so I do most of my listening to music on my Grado SR-225's or my Sennheiser PX-100's (the original version, not the PX-100 II 's, which are not nearly as good).  But I would be pretty happy listening to the 7506's as well.  And when I play my Korg, and/or compose/record, I use the 7506's exclusively and they are awesome.  Highly recommended.hese headphones are really, really great for the price.  And they are very comfortable and have a good amount of isolation.

B000002PCS|5.0|love the sound track that goes with it. I am from the northern part of Michigan and been on island countless times. Stayed at Grand Hotel countless times. Was even there when they were filming the dining room scene.  So all you see in the movie, IS our beautiful part of my state. But where he  drives a car on island, no motorized vehicles are allowed unless police,ambulance,dnr,fire etc..Great music for a great movie.. I play this when I am doing my bible study. Very lovely.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|I finally deleted this app from my kindle fire because 1) it only worked some of the time, and 2) every time this app was opened the bottom of the screen flashed \\"SCANNING ... MULTIPLE VIRUSES DETECTED! DOWNLOAD ANTIVIRUS SCAN NOW\\" the entire time the app was open & in use ...<br /><br />I never could get it to stop! But even worse, once when I was trying to get it to go away, I accidentally triggered it ... it started doing something tricky & unwanted (probably picking thru all my emails, documents, riffling my bank records & Scottrade IRA account - who knows?).<br /><br />Finally, when it was good and finished going through everything it wanted to pick thru, it claimed a had, like ... oh - A BAZILLION VIRUSES on my kindle! It then wanted to sell me an antivirus app for approximately $30.00 + ($ay what?!).<br /><br />I reported the annoying unwanted advertising via my own virus scan & the app's own setting too, but nothing ever changed - so I 86'd it!<br /><br />It was jettisoned, and I am MUCH HAPPIER now.  :)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B006AZZPCM TubeMate YouTube Downloader]
B000ICZD4I|5.0|Love this movie. A good feel movie, I love it because skin has no color to the characters. Everyone but that Sheriff gets a long and likes each other. How life should be.  The scene in the parking  lot is a true winner,and as a grown woman,I loved it.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|As far as free goes, it behaves like you paid for it. It does what it should, there's no unwanted little surprises after installation, and it's not a big battery drain. Nice. I like!
B009AY04A8|1.0|Too slow. too much dialogue. The plot is very slow to unfold and the challenges are virtually all the same.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I CANNOT GET STARTED.  ONCE I CLICK ON AN ITEM THERE IS NOTHING TO DO TO UNLOCK THE NEXT STEP
B000056HE9|5.0|this has always been one of my favorites.  Cary Grant and Loretta Young are so lovely together, and David Niven is spot on as usual.
B009MYARIK|3.0|A slow starter and hard to get into.  Once into the story there were some very funny happenings.  I liked the interplay between the sisters but found it hard to believe that one sister would pull some of stunts on the other.
B001EBYM8A|5.0|Fast paced movie with great actors; trying to prove his innocence.  This is definitely a classic. You can't go wrong with Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones.
B001MSMULG|5.0|Silva can't write fast enough to make me happy. I think I have read them all and eagerly await Gabriel's next escapade
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|for McConaughey, but with a bit of romance, lots of suspense, and his connection of trust with the boys, I enjoyed it a lot.  Wasn't used to seeing a usually sexy McConaughey in such a grungy look, but it didn't diminish his great acting in this role.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I tried this app on my tablet for one week and deleted it. It wouldn't open properly, and bogged down the whole system
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This story has something that everyone can relate to and learn from because it's about relationships going around and around.
B004SYP5WC|1.0|Long waited updates since it does not work in my S3.  Update is already at the play store from Google but not amazon.  Will change my review once I see fixes and updates.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|This was a very good movie. The kids loved that it was very much like the books. I would recommend it to anyone who would like to watch a funny movie.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Having been in downtown Dallas 11/22/63 I have an interest in all things about the JFK assassination. I didn't hear the shots but heard all the sirens from where I was working. Anyway, I think Stephen King got all of the old details nailed down about the geography, people, etc from that time and place, plus it was a very interesting &#34;what if&#34; story. I'm usually not a big fan of time travel stories but this one really worked for me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it it is okay awesome but I hate that you have to pay 20g coins to save yourself
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|I've been a large fan of Guy Clark since his first recording. He continues to be just about my favorite songer/singwriter.
B008XKSW7M|1.0|A waste of time and acting talent from people why can do better. Some funny moments but you will  hate yourself for waiting for them.
B00E97AZZK|4.0|Great movie. Lots of fun. Characters are entertaining, fabulously stereotypical and serve the plot well. The plot kept us guessing till then end. Actually by the end I'd stopped trying to figure it out because it was just so entertaining - I was happy no matter whether I guessed correctly or incorrectly.
B005PK57IK|5.0|this is a great show.  it has a very smart story line that is suspenseful and exciting.  this is the show to watch.
B00E8JZILA|3.0|If you've never played The Walking Dead and you own a Vita this a must buy.  However understand that there a quite a few hiccups in the action as most would come to expect from TellTale although it's a bit worse on the Vita.<br /><br />The best example of this would come from a scene going up a stairwell the action got a bit overwhelming for the Vita and in the process of making my choice of how to proceed the game stalled and the next thing I knew I died. Restarting the scene was frustrating and again somewhat sluggish but I did get through it on the second or third attempt.<br /><br />This minor problem aside there should be no reason for you to stay away from this game.  It's a definite buy especially to show publishers that big games still sell on the Vita.
0316077046|2.0|I really wanted to enjoy this book. Especially if they keep making movies for this series. I always like to read the book before I see the movie, but they are just too darn long to not completely enjoy. The ending makes me want to know what happens next, and there were a few interesting twists thrown in. I'm not sure if it was quite enough to make me read the next book. Maybe.
B004UPANAI|5.0|it might be a completely weird story that has no continuity to the other films or the comics but it is still good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was the best book I ever read I'm only ten but my mom allows me to read it. The next movie is coming out in November. So the next book here I come!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|Characters lack verisimilitude. I couldn't conjure up an ounce of sympathy for any of them.  Plot twist was contrived.  On the whole, a thorough waste of reading time.
B002QYNIHU|5.0|i love the articulation, i love the detail, and goku is like my favorite dragonball/dragonball z character :) lol i recommend this for collectors, you will NOT be disappointed :)
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I enjoyed the brevity and pithiness of this book. The author made the book accessible to anyone willing to view their contribution to the world as a work of art. He paints pictures (both literally and figuratively) to illustrate specific ways to unlock the inner Picasso of the reader.<br /><br />I am often defined by friends and colleagues as a &#34;creative&#34; though I work in the academic support side of higher education. I find myself relating to Seth Godin and Malcolm Gladwell more than Piaget and Vygotsky in my approach to life. This book is written for people like me.<br /><br />If you identify as a &#34;creative&#34; an &#34;artist&#34; or an &#34;idea person,&#34; I would certainly recommend this book to you. You can easily read through this is one sitting, maybe two. So if you want a quick and inspiring read with tangible takeaways, give this book a shot.<br /><br />P.S. I did not give this book a 5/5 because of its eloquence or superior insights. Rather, I rated it based on what it attempted to be. Short, pithy, insightful, inspiring, and practical. It was all of those things, and a little more.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|This is a great movie and a must see along with all the other Batman movies that have come out over the past three to four years.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Great cast. I was hesitant to watch this show but I gave it a try and I liked it a lot.
B004KKX6LQ|4.0|I like this book. This has funny facts that we can use in order to improve our luck. If you want to improve your luck you have to read this book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This continues to be one of my favorite pieces.  I can't seem to find it on my t.v. listings so being able to watch it on my kindle at my leisure is great.
B00E72OKAS|5.0|Very fun game super addictive game could be a little harder though . I would like to see more update soon
B006MW3V6U|5.0|One of the best &#34;non-soap opera&#34; soap operas I have seen.  The settings, wardrobe and actors are superb. Wonderful storyline.
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|So far I have only escaped three rooms and it might get tougher. But I am enjoying it. Easier than doors/level games but fun. [Update:  I finished. The last few rooms were more challenging (I usually have fun but am not a genius at these games, resorting to the cheat after a short time of not getting it). I was almost at the \\"go to the cheat page\\" stage when I had a thought that a couple of pages of clues had the same number of data spaces and could be used together.  The game was long enough that I was not angry at paying 99 cents - 3 rooms would have irked me.  But it was a little short.  I often take a few days - did I mention I am not a genius? - but this one took maybe an hour. But for 99 cents, the fun was good. In general, contrasting to the 100 doors type games, this one can be progressed if you are stuck by just tapping everywhere. A few times I gained a tool and had no clue where it had been. Swept up by my random tapping. That might be why I was able to avoid the cheats. And I was SO proud of myself when I got the last room without cheating. Go me! It is a good game.]
B00004Z4WR|5.0|Movie I've been wanting for awhile now...it gets better and better the more you watch it from time to time!!!!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Initially, when I discovered that the story was about a young girl with cancer, I wasn't sure I wanted to read it.  I was sure it would be very depressing.  But I sampled the first chapter, and then I read the first chapter again, because it was so well written that it hooked me.  The story had some very sad parts, but more importantly, it was enlightening to look through the eyes of the sick person.  These teenagers are almost a sub-culture of America.  The book broadened my understanding, and my humanity.
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|Lots of twist and unpredictable.  My kinda movie. Had never seen or heard of this movie but was glad that I chose it
B00BSWMITK|3.0|There was once a time when Joe Satriani experimented and took risks.  As a musician, I understand how hard it is to balance taking risks with giving people what they want, especially when you've had a taste of fame and fortune.  For example, Engines of Creation tends to be panned more often than praised, but it's one of my top 3 Satch albums.  To me, he took a chance and made it work.  More than made it work, actually; he created a completely unique album that has yet to be equaled.<br /><br />However, it's obvious that as he gets older, he's looking for security as opposed to taking chances.  His last four or five albums have been more or less the same, which can be summed up as: create a rock chord progression, play a melody over that, mix in some solos, and call it a day.<br /><br />This album isn't bad, it just doesn't rank with his best works.  And I'm sad to say, it sounds like his technique is starting to erode.  I love Joe Satriani and will buy anything that features his guitar playing, but for those of you who don't feel the same way, you can probably skip this album.  Surfing with the Alien, Flying in a Blue Dream, and The Extremist are far superior.  Hopefully some day Joe will throw caution to the wind and create an album full of surprises and chances.  Until then, we're stuck with middle-of-the-road output by one of the greatest electric guitarists of all-time.
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|\\"Mud\\" was probably a hard film to market because its themes are difficult to pigeonhole.  Centered around the banks of the Mississippi it concerns itself with two fourteen year old friends, Ellis(Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland), whose bond is probably forged by less than ideal home lives.  Ellis' parents are on the cusp of separation and Neckbone lives with an uncle his natural parents nowhere to be found.  They have a secret hideaway on a desert island on the river and one day they find an interloper to their idyll, Mud(Matthew McConaughey).  Rumpled in appearance with a pistol strapped to his waist Mud relates a tale of him being on the run from bounty hunters because he killed a man who was abusing the love of his life, Juniper(Reese Witherspoon).  The boys are taken in by these tales of alleged gallantry and start doing favors for Mud.  It begins with them bringing him food, then passing messages to Juniper, and finally scrounging parts for Mud's boat.  The message here is twofold.  \\"Mud\\" illustrates the rocky road from adolescence to the teen years and secondly how the impressionable clamor for romance even if it is far removed from the truth.  McConaughey is absolutely spellbinding as the rascal Mud and the two newcomers are screen naturals who seem to be playing real teens and not facsimiles.  Director-writer Jeff Nichols not only crafts a terrific script but establishes an eerie mood to accompany his words.  \\"Mud\\" is a fascinating film that takes any number of twists and turns that you won't guess the ultimate outcome.  Just enjoy the boat ride.
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|Buyer beware. Not all special features included.<br /><br />Although this is a somewhat polarizing Star Trek film that leaves most hard core Trek fans seething, I enjoyed the film myself. I was happy to pre-order as soon as it became available here on Amazon until I researched the extras elsewhere and found the disturbing news that Paramount has decided to sprinkle exclusive extras around to the different retailers. Therefore, when you buy the blu-ray here on Amazon there are many extras you are not going to get. In order to collect all the special features you would probably have to buy at least 3 copies - all from different retailers. This is completely unacceptable as one of the special features you will NOT receive with the Amazon Blu-Ray is the audio commentary. I could almost excuse the mostly throwaway featurettes. But the audio commentary? That should be included on every single Blu-Ray hard copy you buy (unless, of course, it is a movie only release). As it stands, I believe only itunes and the Target 4 disc edition include the audio commentary (although they have made it so difficult to find out what extras are included where that it would be like a scavenger hunt to collect all the extras). As it stands Amazon is not listed as one of the retailers to include the audio commentary.<br /><br />Paramount and other studios are expected to continue this trend on future releases (I believe World War Z is the next major release to divide important supplemental material amongst various retailers) and I would advise any Blu-Ray collector to boycott any such release until they stop this disturbing practice.<br /><br />I was looking forward to this film arriving at my door on release day but have cancelled my order in protest. Buying a retail copy of a major studio release should grant you the additional material no matter where you choose to buy it. As a loyal Amazon customer that is my retailer of choice. I will not buy any copy of this film as a result of this major slap in the face to fans of the film and Blu-Ray collectors alike.
B00AFEY354|5.0|The complaint of many authors is Hollywood botches their work when they translate it to the silver screen.  Stephen Chbosky solves that problem by not only writing the script but directing it as well.  \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" brings a new perspective to the age old theme of fitting in at high school.  The solution to that of course is not so much fitting in but finding a group of iconoclasts who will accept you quirks and all.  The film set in Pittsburgh sometime in the mid-Eighties focuses on a shy freshman, Charlie (Logan Lerman), who prior to entering his new school had a nervous breakdown.  He is befriended by a pair of upperclassmen, the free-spirited Sam (Emma Watson) and her flamboyant stepbrother, Patrick(Ezra Miller).  The bond the three share is they've had life events that nobody their age should experience.  The film demonstrates the ecstasy and joy of youth as well as the pain and heartache of those tender years.  There is the music, parties, and celebrations none more extravagant than audience participation at the \\"Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" to distract them until college beckons.  What I liked about the film is the kids are intelligent but not beyond their years.  The adults in their lives are sympathetic none moreso than Mr. Anderson(Paul Rudd), an English teacher who offers Charlie encouragement.  All three lead teens are impeccable in their roles.  Rotten Tomatoes gave this film the FRESH rating.  How appropriate when you consider the fresh take to its subject matter it offers
B002ZG974M|2.0|This film was BORING!  No talking no explanations or narration.  It's just watching different babies in different parts of the world as they grow.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Had to uninstall. Each time game was played my HD kindle fire screen turns off.  Grandchildren love the video and the game.
B00EOO55GW|4.0|Good range of song types - ballads to headbanging; you can easily tell it is A7X but the songs have unique character from previous albums.
B00EVN2D3O|5.0|Compare with the original cut, the story and relationship among characters are much more intense and make sense better!<br />I watched Now you see me 3 times in the theater and bought the bluray/dvd combo, yeah I'm quite a big fan of the film and waiting for the sequel as well.<br />This is why I'm giving 5 stars :) Please enjoy!
B00E193TM2|4.0|You could accuse 5FDP of being too consistent in their sound but they have mixed in some really good changes of pace and the collaborations with tech9, Jamey Jasta, Rob Halford, etc.. add a nice touch to the resulting album
B008XKSW7M|2.0|The movie was just OK at the best. It seemed to drag on in many scenes. I was expecting more with the famous actors and actresses in it.
B0054XOMX4|5.0|Grandson loved it!  Super fast he said.  He bet his Dad right away.  Can't wait to play with his cousin.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|As a professional sound engineer, I can highly recommend these as they 'hold up' when used in a mix-down  environment.
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|Amazon sent me this cord since my Kindle Fire will no longer charge.  Amazon replace my Kindle once, but won't do it again so they sent me a cord and a power fast...still have to wiggle the cord, prop it up under a rolled up sock or something to try and get the connection inside the Kindle to charge it.  I'm pretty sure the cord is ok, but the Kindle is bad.
B009K5257M|4.0|Halloween H2O is a good movie, not just because Jamie Lee Curtis reprises her role as Laurie Strode, but because it has a believable story, good setting, and solid acting. In this movie, Laurie is haunted by memories of Michael Myers, and is fearful that he may return to kill her. Laurie shows her vulnerability by becoming an alcoholic while trying to cope with her demons. She has since moved far away (northern California) but that doesn't stop Michael from finding and stalking her. This movie still has the same brand of suspense, chills, and fright that the first movie became known for. Nothing will ever top Halloween 1978, but this one is worthy of a good look. 8/10
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Fun action movie, like the motorcycles better this time. It was interesting when they locked the block down and the gang went after the judges. It was nice to see weapons that could run out of ammo.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|I read about half the book and finally skipped around the last half just to see how it ended. For me the major flaw is that the characters aren't likeable. Pat, the main character, seems more like a 5 year old than a grown man. Just not enough substance to the characters and the story.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Kahn as you never knew him, the new characters continue to grow. Do not use the previous Star Trek series as the yardstick and you will enjoy this movie more. It is a different time-line and a lot of things will be different this time.
B007FTZDN8|2.0|Very frustrating app.  I can see all of the wonderful TED talks just waiting to be enjoyed.  Not a single one will actually play.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Good movie for action night, I loved it when the Hulk smashes Loki. Special effects were good as usual in the Marvel universe.
B0086700CM|4.0|This is another app my daughters enjoy during waiting times/down times.  Take the Kindle Fire to doctor's appointments and make the time go faster with a quick game or two.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|If not for the well played high school skip day than definitely for a soundtrack that you'll be reminded of often through out life

B00785P2QC|5.0|Love this game . Play for hours and hours . It's also so relaxing. I'm most definitely hooked on the game
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Very good! I really love the sci-fi action. I never thought the FBI did so much LSD. Seriously, very entertaining.
B003XDVVO0|4.0|I was told by several coworkers (this was required for work) that I should buy a little big. I did and I am glad of it, I have so far spent two full work days on my feet (lifeguard) in these shoes and the only pain I have to show for breaking them in is a small bruise about the size of a pencil eraser inside my instep on my right foot. Otherwise the shoes fit amazing and work great. Though I do have to keep sticking my feet in the pool because the black plastic starts to heat up and burn my skin in the sun.
B00008K7AM|5.0|I've always like Rob. I think it's quite a funny movie. Cheesy but funny not bad for the prize too since its old movie
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is so cool I am like asides to it<br />So any one wanna play go ahead so ahhhhhh

B007AL48UK|4.0|This game is very easy to down load. It works good and a fun game to play.I enjoy playing Mahjong games.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|All the others were terrible but one other you would swear was the same developer was good. Before you get 100 doors this is the one you want . It is short and I am waiting for the added floors they promised were coming. This is one of 2 polished and well working escape games.
B006LR0XLM|1.0|I couldn't get this to work on my Kindle Fire.  I have it on my computer and would have liked to have used it on my Kindle when I travel.  I did see a statement about not working on the device but I saw a write up that stated someone had downloaded it and used it and said he/she used it and it worked fine. Based on that I went ahead and downloaded it.  I can see it on my list of purchases but it doesn't show up when I try to sync my Kindle to purchases. Bummer!!!
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Lots of stars for but don't waste your time on 100 floors or others. The graphics are lousy except This  one and can you escape. I played these first and was so disappointed that I was done and no other games like this one did anything close. I can't wait for more floors the developer promised to come soon. You can't play the best and then have fun on 100 floors or the on  called doors and something ? There's just nothing else that looks good and has lots of different clues to put together on each level.
B0050DZN4K|3.0|I adopted freely reluctantly after my Google reader was discontinued.  I like the graphics better on feedly.  But feedly freezes, repeats, and drops more than I would like.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is amazing game . You can download  this app gameloft is very good custom thanks to make this app
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I love how JJ Abrams revived Star Trek. This is the best Star Trek movie to date. Must watch it.
B005DWBO0K|4.0|Great quality ..unexpected.  The facial expressions say more than words could convey. Enjoyable and great experience to share with family and friends.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Nice game I really like the fact that for me it continues to run even while my kindle was off over nite
140006922X|5.0|What a great read.  I was raised in a fundamental, Christian background and was a devoted church member until about 40.  The past 30 years I have been much more open to other ideas and found this book to be extremely interesting historical material.  So many things made sense.  I wish EVERYONE would read this book with an open and inquiring mind.  (If your mind is already made up, why read anything?)
B0026NBZDU|5.0|Caught me off guard more than once. It's definitely a page turner. Not a bad way to spend idle time, you could read much worse.
B002DEI4NG|3.0|but seems a little dated... if it was free for prime members I would probably watch more but at a $1.99 per episode its just too much.....<br /><br />It's likeable but formulaic.  And it's confusing... doesn't Lorelai have 2 OLDER kids, have 2 brothers and a sister, 2 kind, wise, and loving parents, didn't she hook-up w  Ray Romano that bumbly photographer???....<br /><br />OH WAIT...... that's PARENTHOOD.....<br /><br />never mind...
B007EDYN36|4.0|Good book, I liked it.  Little history of how Peter Criss came into kiss, left, and returned always seeming to be the underdog.
B002ZG9774|5.0|I'm not a particular fan of either star in this movie, but the music and dance numbers - and the storyline - is very entertaining.  I've watched and re-watched it several times!
B009CPE424|4.0|Great for the family. My kids love these movies.  The humor is good for adults too. My son now wants to buy it.
B00005JLR8|5.0|Such a surprise of a movie. I hadnt heard of it until of late. IT is very good...A+ acting from all ! Such a good story too. You will love it. I give it a big A+++++++ for a wonderful movie.......
B008QYT7DI|5.0|Such a great book. It makes you think about life in a different perspective and helps you to appreciate the aw and wonder of little kids because as you grow older you forget about the innocence and honesty that you once had as a child. And they probably see the world in such a more beautiful and clearer way because as adults we forget the purity and beauty of it all....
B006HGXGWU|5.0|This one strange movie. I had to watch it twice to understand it. But man it is good. Never heard of it when it 1st came out. So I missed it.But i saw it on cable and had to have it... Goodness the acting is good. ...Give it a chance i think most people will love it... A very high rating from me. A+++++++++++love it. One more thing the actress who played the wife and the child in this film are wonderful. A must see i think..
1892005034|5.0|NVC, or more aptly named, compassionate communication, is a way of expressing one's thoughts, feelings, and needs in a way that creates a friendly empathetic connection and shared understanding. This sounds like hippy new age stuff but this book contains a hard-core fundamental shift in understanding language and human relations. If you spend more than 1% of your life with other humans, ignore this book at your own (and others') peril.
B000QDA7OU|5.0|This is one good film It is a long movie. But its good to watch it. It reminds us of how it was.. places you right into the convent and lets you see just how it was.You would have to look hard and long for a convent like this today . All the acting is great... A Big A+++++++++from me.....love it/
B003U53GK8|5.0|Not enough explanation. All dead copout...something must have happened on the plane.  We just didn't  deserve to find our I guess...
B000TGJ80S|5.0|When it comes to movies about the dear Count. I would say this is well worth watching. It is awfully overacted. And the accents in this film will make you sick after a while...But i bet you cant turn it off.  Gary Oldman is always good no matter what he does. He is my favorite actor . I remember him so much for the movies he has made.And many are on my top ten best movies...  A++++++ for Gary Oldman . An C- to the rest......But a movie you will need in your collection......
B00BRUQ3PS|2.0|Blah. No suspense, no intrigue, no interesting revelations.  I was really looking forward to the third book -- the first two were amazing, as outlined in the reviews posted.  I had to find out what happened, and now I know what happened.  That's it. I'm thankful that she wrapped up the story, but this book was so blah that I'm kind of shocked.  Every other work of hers is first class storytelling, so if this is your first exposure to her, read others!
B0038AUY96|4.0|Easy reading, with some slow passages here and there. The plot is reasobly complex, even if not always credible and I liked it.
1401307957|3.0|with lots of examples of his sketches around town and explanation of how he used art to recover from the pain/confusion of his wife's accident and how their life changed.
B0000636NQ|5.0|What a fitting requiem for one of the best guitarist the rcok world has ever known, along with Eric Clapton, Robin Trower, Carlos Santana, and others. Rest in Peace Alvin Lee. With all the other great solo guitarists and rock and rollers that have gone to that final resting place, what a concert that must be.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I heard about EVERNOTE in a class for computer users to better use and understand the benefits of a computer. This is better than pencil and paper, voice recorder or anything else to assist in keeping you organized and storing data you come across daily. The Web Clipper feature is fantastic, which allows/helps you keep an article you read on the net in one place for easy review. Evernote syncs across all of my technology stuff without extra's, i.e., cables or other software or whatever.<br />Try it.....you WILL like it.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Great read! Watched the Netflix show first and then wanted to know the true story behind it. Some details were changed on the show for dramatic effect but still a very complex story with rich characters. It can be hilarious and sad and thought provoking all in one chapter.

B00BVYU2P2|5.0|This a funny, well written comedy. Not for 14 and younger crowd. I really enjoy watching it.<br />It deals with teen issues, and can seem very tasteless. You HAVE to have a sense of humor to watch it. This is NOT an after school special. It's not trying to teach any lessons.<br /><br />It's just a comedy!<br />The mean girl is GREAT! Your welcome!:-)

0545128285|3.0|I am not a big JK Rowling fan, yet with the release of her first adult novel The Casual Vacancy, i felt like i needed to give her another chance, because let's face it; she is one of or the biggest selling authors of all time. So after my trip to the local library resulted in me picking up this collection of short fables from the Harry Potter world, i decided that i didn't really have anything to lose really, did i?<br /><br />Now actually, The Tales of Beedle the Bard is not actually a bad book and i was pleasantly surprised by how addictive these little stories were. The book actually consists of five short fables with a summary of each penned by none other than Professor Albus Dumbledore, with finer points/corrections made by JK Rowling herself.<br /><br />I think it is safe to say that yes as predicted this little book is ideal for any fan of the Harry Potter books and not really aimed for a quick pick up and read from a non Harry Potter reader; although there were points i enjoyed. I think the little things will make the series' fans smile, such as the inscription at the front which reads `Translated from the original runes by Hermione Granger.' But alas, apart from through Dumbledore's summary, no actual Harry Potter character appears within these fables and that works well for the book; simply because it adds a new dimension to a world already created.<br /><br />After reading the first story `The Wizard and The Hopping Pot' i thought oh no, i really am not going to like this. Yet to my surprise, my favourite of the five has to be the second story `The Fountain of Fair Fortune' which oddly enough gives off so much character and charm without the need for extravagant detail, and it is because of this that you realise that actually JK Rowling has pulled it off. If you compare this to all of the classical fairy tales we know, it is written in such a similar manner that it becomes instantly memorable and very readable.<br /><br />I also liked some of the darker,more mature themes that run through the stories such as `The Warlock's Hairy Heart' which questions our very own humanity and although it is very obvious where she got her idea from for this, it does leave us with a sort of tragedy guise.<br /><br />Strangely enough, i quite enjoyed the summaries by Dumbledore too as they came across ever so witty, yet at times sarcastic too, which is such a great British gift, it's almost a travesty not to chuckle at.<br /><br />It isn't without it's faults though; two of the five stories were unoriginal and if i am honest, quite boring and lame. As they are so short to read, it makes the weaker stories stand out so much more and with themes like good vs evil and characters so obvious, it's a shame as to what is otherwise a cute little collection.<br /><br />There is one huge qualm i had with this however and that was through JK Rowling's very own notes throughout Dumbledore's pen. This book's royalties were all donated to a children's charity which is commendable. However, like most ref. books and classics that have Author's notes she tries to explain various points and terms. I couldn't stand to see another `*see my other book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them`. This is just plain plugging and it astounds me that a lot of reviewers missed this.<br /><br />Anyhow, overall i was pleased i read this as it has motivated a little spark within me to read more JK Rowling. I can remember the first three Harry Potter books and i think i owe it t one of the world's greatest authors that i continue to read the series in its entirety. The Tales of Beedle the Bard are short, quite charming, endearing at times with humorous anecdotes from Harry Potter characters and has something that will appeal to someone. Harry Potter fans will love this, non Harry Potter fans less so, but it is definitely worth one read through.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show! Interesting, captivating and very entertaining. Highly recommend this season! Really enjoy the period piece and the beautiful costumes.
0316228583|4.0|After being won over by the hype of The Casual Vacancy, her first adult novel, I decided to give this a go and thankfully I was proven wrong.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is all about the lives of several families following the aftermath of Barry Fairbrother's untimely death. Barry, universally respected by most, was a member of the Pagford council and now an empty seat has emerged, the little idyllic town throws itself into the most political of wars. You could be excused for thinking that this doesn't sound the least bit interesting as storylines go and to be honest it isn't, but what this book is really about is the characters and their actions.<br /><br />I've got to say that, despite including major minority groups into the novel, Rowling actually creates a real living example of British society today. As I was reading, I saw familiar people; people I could easily recognise living in my own town. Many critics have accused Rowling of creating characters that are wooden and two dimensional, but I completely disagree. I mean, of course I'm not aware of where people live, but I think if you live in a large city, you miss out on all of the nuances of what a small community feels like and what people are willing to do, just for information or gossip.<br /><br />Rowling sets a beautiful scene with Pagford and then adds a more severe backdrop with the `fields'; a run down area of council housing, drug addicts and prostitutes, that some residents don't want it to be associated with their heavenly Pagford, and instead start a campaign to have it removed from their border into the neighbouring town of Yarvil. Of course, wonderful Barry Fairbrother was against this idea and so the loved ones left behind after his death, feel the need to rally and make a stand against Howard Mollison and his motley crew.<br /><br />But as I've already said, the gem of a book here really lies within the personal lives of Pagford's residents. It really does ring true that from an outside perspective, families seems perfect and happy, but once you delve into the small cracks left open you begin to form a picture that includes unhappiness, class, snobbery, drugs, youth, self harm and even rape. It's interesting to see that the young people of Pagford start to formulate their own personal war over their parents and actually cause quite a stir amongst the democratic election of poor Barry Fairbrother's vacant seat.<br /><br />She's really hit the nail on the head with the characterisation and adapted her narrative depending on whom that particular section is about. Shirley Mollison is a snob, someone who backs up her husband without question and is always on the look out for juicy gossip. Samantha Mollison is unhappy in her marriage and starts to fall for `Jake', a member of her daughter's favourite boyband - he is sixteen. Krystal Weedon is a resident of the Fields and daughter to drug addict Terri. Kyrstal actually forms quite a big chunk of the story with her brash, aggressive attitude and loose morals.<br /><br />Another area the critics didn't seem to like was the ending; I actually thought the finale was just right. It left it where it needed to be left. It could so have easily run on, but like a true writer, Rowling knew where to end it. I can't give anything away as that would be unfair, but I didn't see it coming. I should have done; I've guessed endings much more clichéd than this, but I think the result of this is that I was so engrossed in the book that I wasn't actually trying to guess anything. It came naturally to me and I enjoyed it more because of it.<br /><br />The book isn't perfect however. I thought the layout mostly needed reinventing. It is split into seven parts, which is fine, but at the beginning it formulated a concept of a different day of the week as the heading and then what happened on that day. I felt this could have worked wonderfully throughout rather than scrapping it after the first part and ultimately it sometimes became hard to realise how much time had passed since reading different parts, or even chapters for that matter.<br /><br />You don't have to like a character for you to understand why the author decided to take their journey down a certain path. If you understand it then that's just part of the journey of reading itself. However, I have to say that one particular `path' regarding Gavin Hughes, a lawyer in Pagford, was pathetic! I was totally smacked in the face when I discovered, towards the end, what was going on with him. And not in a good way too. The storyline here for him was ridiculous, completely unnecessary and actually a little annoying. It was as if Rowling couldn't find a way to end things for him in the book so she took a wild grab in the air and pulled this idea straight from an episode of a soap.<br /><br />I do have to say however, that actually JK Rowling has won me over; for her adult novels that is. It is full of character, exceptional use of authentic voice and completely engrossing. I had my particular favourite characters and a few who got on my nerves; but that's real life, isn't it? This is adult fiction that is unlike anything other I have read before and I'm happy I gave it a go. It is so realistic how she managed to divide people here not only in class, but also political views, location, age and religion. I happily take my hat off to Rowling and admit, I was wrong.
0399208534|5.0|Gave this with a knitted caterpillar to my first grandchild - visually stunning book that all of my 3 (now adult) kids loved.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|It's more intense and less light-hearted than Season 1, but it's still one of the best written and best acted shows I've seen.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|Not too bad, from an adult perspective: ok music, characters flat but kind, dialogue not too irritating. My 8- year old daughter and 6-year old son LOVE it! The message is positive.
B009KEN87O|3.0|I love this game, is great, retro looking but smoothly done, all in all a 5 star deserving app, but I got tthis game as a FAOTD, and now is telling me that it's an illegal copy and only let's me play up to lvl 2... Solve this please
B00AB7HESI|3.0|in my opinion this game is ok I guess but to be honest I want a game that I can play that doesn't make me pay twice just to get the full experience I am not going to pay a single buck just to get all the levels and characters for all that the game should be free but The concept is still pretty cool so I by give out a 3 out of 5
B008JJM88Q|5.0|We played this at our Beach Retreat and had the most fun. Kids and adults could play this game together.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I have a kindle and the items on the screen were way too small. I did enjoy playing the game though.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is futuristic and it is a great movie i have seen it at least 5 times.<br />a couple of friends seen it with me and they liked it as much as i did.
B008469DGY|3.0|this progrom  is ok, after you jearn to play it. better instructions would be most helpful or a slow learner
B00D7JGL36|5.0|This is an absoulutely terrific album - a wonderful tribute to Merle and Buck :)  - Hope they do a second album.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|The automatic cue to the aJV is descriminatory to the other versions avaikable/ It would be better if a choice of versions was allowed at the time of choosing the app.
B001609SQA|5.0|Loved it... have loved it for years... trying to find it on BlueRay at a reasonable price.<br />I'd love to see an updated (read: remastered) version where the effects are cleaned up a bit but the cheese adds to the nostalgia.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I originally had the free version, and found a few issues. The cycle would have stops and there wasn't a lot of sounds. With this version, it is much better. There are much more sounds, and the glitches were fixed. I use this to help me sleep at night, and it really does help. You can create the perfect sound that relaxes you.<br /> Also, the variety is very nice. Overall, worth your money
B0011Z7ILM|4.0|It's a good album, with a few really great songs. As a longtime Pantera fan, it isn't really that heavy, but the vocals are a nice change of pace. My one complaint is that sometimes the guitar is too low in the mix.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Good game, like the graphics wish the time was longer while I am building up my coins.  The first couple dozen runs really take some time in free mode.
B002BBJ52U|1.0|This film is terribly written, in particular the annoying and cliche \\"direct-to-audience\\" segments. This film is full of cliche's about how people behave, especially single women. Apart the excellent, and completely-wasted, cast of talented actors, there was little of value here. In fact, I'm surprised this film was funded since it offers absolutely nothing new to the genre or to life. WASTE of TIME!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Worth reading<br />Well organized, entertaining and exciting.  Excellent job  done by John Gresham.<br />A must read for the reader that likes crime and conspiracy books.
B000TGCR38|1.0|The movie is excessively violent, crudely sexual and depressing.  I cannot say enough bad about it.  I do not mind that it is in foreign language with subtitles, but one should know that before purchasing it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use as well as quick and accurate, this app is great. There are no bugs and it doesn't freeze. Fast to open and close.
B0058VW36U|5.0|love it! it makes you think and entertains you. It's easy to understand how to play it. I totally recommend it.
B004X80QNG|2.0|As far as I can tell this only syncs to your google calender in an indirect way by syncing directly to your gmail account as it is set up on the Kindle (android calander, as it calls it in the settings). But this does not let you have full access to your google calender like the Calengoo app does. So, I am not seeing any of my linked calanders that are set up on my Google Calender online. Some reviewers said you had to check off some box to sync it to your google account that is in the settings, I can find no such box in the settings, and I checked every setting available. This app automatically picks up your android gmail account settings when it installs and syncs through them. But it only syncs your calander, not the linked ones.<br /><br />This is a deal breaker for me since I have my wife's calender, and some others, linked to my google calander so we can see each others schedules. Calengoo is the only app I have found for the Kindle so far that links and syncs directly to my Google calander account and gives me full access to all my linked calendars. Glad I did not pay for it and got it as the FAOTD. It also seems really overpriced to me at $9.99. I have never paid that much for any app.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Old movie, funny movie and it was reasonably priced.  Could not get it via netflix, so 4 more words here.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|I thought it used too much battery and I just didn't like how it was programmed for my use of an alarm.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|yes, it was a great deal, with all 4 movies & reasonable price, now 5 more words to get this done.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator app. I've tried several. Most are more than I need. I love that this is simply and elegantly what it is intended to be. I love the simple screen design, the colors, and the size of the keys.

B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|I found several other Jesse Stone Movies on a clearance rack at a store and bought this one to complete my collection. Tom Selleck is the perfect Jesse Stone.  I totally believe his struggle to stay sober, and his fierce search for the truth when investigating crime.  Love him!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So emotional but so real and true. I felt like I was watching all of this happen to katniss and parts and Gale. Glad I had the opportunity to read this series. So well written thank you Suzanne.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|A clear, if not vivid, view is given of the socio-economic, religious, and geopolitical reaity of Jesus of Nazarath.  The life of this man and the development of cults after his death and death are preented based on available evidence and with educated arguments for likely motivations of all involved.  The cults led by James and by Paul are presented to illuminate the divergence of the radical Pauline sect from the original Jewish sect.  It was an interesting read but arguments were repetitious and labored.  More informative than entertaining.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|who could hate goodfellas.  one of the best mob movies made.  If you haven't seen it you need to right now.

B005XQLBU4|3.0|Just like other missle defenders games. I have always enjoyed these games. I like the upgrading. I wish there were more options to upgrade but hey its still fun.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is an outstanding history of the times of Christ.  I suppose fundamentalist Christians will not like their version of this history being challenged.  But it really should not intimidate them but rather enrich their faith and understanding.  The author does not in any way set out to deny or demean Christ but rather to paint a clearer picture of what he was like during this ancient time period.  I understand the author's reseach took 20 years and the result is a testament to that hard work.  Great read.
B000VSBX34|5.0|Silly Beatles 60ish carryings on.  Fun to watch on occasion.  Not the best or worst of movies, just a fun evening.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|I love the show...  I thought this season kinda lost focus at times.  I think over all I enjoyed the eighth year of Supernatural.... at least the last few shows were great!
B009GEDP26|5.0|My wife and I love Castle and seeing Season 5 is a real treat! We just started watching Castle this year so being able to see more of their shows is a real treat.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Sturdy, attractive, and holds up to heavy use.  Really very easy to install.  Our six year old did it.  Handy built in stand feature.  Closing the cover usually (but not always) turns the screen off and saves power.  I'm very pleased with this product and would buy another one if I had another Kindle.
B000FC146C|5.0|I had read this book a long time ago and have really enjoyed reading it again. It is a classic.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|I rented the new version of The Great Gatsby and I am not a fan of it. One thing that was wrong with it was the soundtrack, that had nothing to do with the period. I perfer the version with Robert Redford, Mia Farrow and Bruce Dern. When Leonardo Di Caprio used the tag line, Old Sport, it just did not seem right. The character of Jordan Baker was miscast. The only member of the new cast I did like was Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan. Tobey McGuire was acceptable as Nick Carroway. Mr. DiCaprio is not a bad actor, again miscast as Gatsby. I suggest watching the Redford version and then watch the new version. A&E also made a production starring Mira Sorvino and that too was disappointing.
157330087X|5.0|Saw this on PBS years ago, tried to record it, but it didn't take. Been waiting to finally get it. Very pleased to say the least.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Great game over all but I'm having trouble finding my chests because they have turned invisible. Don't know if it's some glitch or a weird prank. Pls fix.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Just like I remember great movie for the times some 4 letter words. It is pg shows to work together.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|No need to review this movie which is well known and beloved.<br /><br />The special packaging is great. We gave this to my wife as a Mother's Day gift, and she loves it, especially the &#34;My Favorite Things&#34; musical keepsake box.<br /><br />I got a great price on this set from amazon. Hope you're as lucky.<br /><br />Recommended.
B00992CF6W|1.0|no instructions, minimal interface, view sucks.  the small screen version is impossible to focus on and there doesn't seem to be any zoom out for a better view.  don't waste your money, you'll regret it.
B004SEUJX2|3.0|Too bad the original print of this movie is such a mess. I was hoping the BluRay might have improved things, but it doesn't.<br /><br />The BluRay Book packaging is nice, but the print of the movie itself retains all of its long-documented problems.<br /><br />Worth a purchase if the price drops under $10.
B003EYVY04|1.0|I ordered the three disk ultimate edition, and all I received was the single disk movie. I was very disappointed.
B0053XM7ZU|5.0|Loving the whole series. Love the characters, especially Tyrion and his wicked wit and sense of humour. Awesome 5 stars.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|For a show filmed in the 70's, this is wonderful.  I enjoyed it along with the following seasons.  I would recommend it to everyone.  Learned quite a lot about WW1.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This makes the perfect travel alarm. I no longer have to carry an actual clock with all the other gadgets on a business trip.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game was easy to understand and is fun to play.<br />The action is quick and the colors are bright. The cards are easy to read.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Just like old times!! This app takes me back to Atari Missile Command and is loads of fun.  Great game for free when I got it on the free day!
B006O2QNOU|4.0|Kind of goes along with my theory that Wall Street creates these bubbles just to make themselves more money. Good acting and a reasonably good plot. I have always preferred movies with a little more dialogue and less shooting. Solid entertainment.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Fantastic fantasy story about childhood. I found myself thinking about my own upbringing several times. Gaiman has the ability to interweave daily life with an alternate universe in an interesting blend.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great movie all around. Funny, good graphics, and story line made sense despite the intergalactic ambiguity. Would recommend for any one.
0061801313|5.0|I bought this book set for my 13 year old 8th grader to read during the summer, and she devoured it.  She had a book in her hand wherever we went and I heard all about Ali, Emily, Hannah, Aria etc...<br />She absolutely loved the set and I'm happy she was able to grow her love for reading.
B00004YW6I|5.0|&#34;Stories from the city stories fom the sea&#34; is a rush of adrenaline from beginning to end.  Commencing with the startling 'big exit', you can already feel the overall tone of the album, which is a poppy-garage rock collection of ancedotes from PJ Harvey's stay in nyc, compared with her small town rural beginnings, the 'sea'.<br /><br />  Track 2, 'good fortune' the lead single, too, is arguably the catchiest on the album, and it continues the same sound from 'big exit'.  However, 'a place called home' is the weakest on the album, with a madonna-esque 80s tambourine beat in the background, and messes the up the big picture.  The songs  slow down during tracks 4-5, with 'one line' being another gem here, and 'beautiful feeling' being somewhat forgettable.<br /><br />Track 6, 'the whores hustle...' is the urban centerpiece of the album, with images of pimps, drugs, and poverty sung throughout.  This song begins the best 3-song stretch on the album, leading into the beautiful duet with radiohead frontman thom yorke, 'this mess we're in' and ending with 'you said something' which teases first time listeners with the colorful melody and cliffhanger lyrics.<br /><br />'Kamikaze', turns that wonderful stretch into something reminescent of 'rid of me' pj's second album, and her most raw.  Its the shortest track, but it's a blunt force object to the head in comparison with 'you said somehting'. Track 10, 'this is love' is a fan favorite, and for good reason, with its satisfying reptition and visceral uniqueness.<br /><br />'Horses in my dreams' is clearly exhausted by the last two tracks, as it is a slow moving, piano based ballad that reflects the extreme 'sea' part of the title.  Moving, and gorgeous, and a diamond compared to the other gems. 'We float' is the archetypal calming album finale, taking note of 'horses' and allowing the listener to, well, float!<br /><br />This is a definite buy for any music fan, and a great starter album for pj harvey.<br /><br />Thetwo best tracks are the 'city' extreme, &#34;the whores hustle...&#34; ans its opposite, &#34;horses in my dreams&#34;.<br />1. the whores hustle<br />2. Horses in my dreams<br />3. Good fortune<br />4. This is love<br />5. This mess we're in<br />6. You said something/one line<br />7. Beautiful feeling/we float<br />8.kamikaze<br />9. Big exit<br />-1,000,000. A place called home ( just skip it!)
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|The movie was extreamly slow. My husband and I continued to watch just to see if any thing would happen. But it didn't. Will not watch this movie angain
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it. Works great and it makes me smile when I bring it up on my Kindle; it's BIG.
1612680011|5.0|I haven't finish reading this book yet but it shows a lot of wisdom's that may used in you daily life. the book is really nice since it helps you to deal with your children.
B00B9366VO|5.0|If you are a Rock music fan this is a must watch movie. Some of the greatest bands recorded there. Once you see this you will listen to those bands in a different light.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|From the beginning, this book caught my attention and my imagination started ...WOW!!  towards the end, it got me hanging, thus I had to get the second one ...
B000GWE44U|5.0|This is one of my favorite all time movies!!!! No horror collection is complete without this movie in it!!! Jack Nicolson is great!!!!!
B009MYARIK|3.0|This was not my favorite Sophie Kinsella book. I was disappointed by this compared to her other books which have made great vacation reading.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Much like \\"Cosmic Trigger\\" ,this book will help to remove the preconceived notions that limit our perceptions of \\"Life\\"I recommend it highly.!
B00957T6X6|5.0|We have watched the series & wanted to get detail by reading the book.  What a thrill it has been to find the books even more enjoyable than the movie.  Great writer.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|Taylor Swift is such an amazing artist. I enjoy listening to her music, not to mention my daughter is also a huge fan of hers, too.
B00004TX5F|5.0|The movie is fascinating!!! The acting and singing was superb, and I was enthralled by how they actually weaved the soprano vopices and coutnertentor voice together to make Farinelli sound beautiful!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This app is very relaxing both the art and the music as well as challenging. Several friends have gotten it as well after playing on mine.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a Fun game with lots of mini games in addition to hidden object puzzles. Fun stress free game
B003W0BYQ4|4.0|well done for this type of western. wayne, martin play well together and rick nelson did fine. there where times and funny times. overall is entertaining.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|I like this kind of game...easy to pick up and put down when I should be working! Takes just a little bit of concentration.
B003FBMS4W|3.0|This movie is O.K., but not realistic in regard to the actual happenings.  It has been drastically fictionalized and &#34;cleaned up&#34;.  But then, director Ford was never known for sticking to the facts, even on an event that has been so well documented.  The scenery is stunning, but also nothing like the territory where the Parker family actually lived.
B0091W7MP4|4.0|Love Sigourney Weaver and Adore Harry Connick Jr! It's suspenseful, well acted and a great story line as well. Like it alot
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Buddy's best album in years.  I wish he would use his own band, not studio musicians.  Would love to see him do the whole album @ his club Legends in Chicago.
B00CLD65X0|4.0|I have enjoyed the series I like the way the plots are going I do think that you have gone a bit too far when you keep killing off main characters. The men of the family are NOT the enemy and they deserve some happiness. I was terribly disappointed when that happened and I really wonder if I can invest in the show any more . They deserve some something
B001XUJMZK|5.0|I  love this movie. Watched it when it was first released, bought then DVD, bought it in HD version, watched it  on television after  DVD player broke & now get to watch it on Amazon Prime when no  other movie looks appealing. Mel Gibson did a terrific job. And to me this has become a classic. I even ordered historical fiction books for that Scottish time period. Great movie! I highly recommend it to anyone.
B009MYARIK|5.0|It had been awhile since I'd read one of her book. And as always she didn't let me down. I loved the characters. So many funny parts, that I couldn't help but laugh out loud. Wedding Night is probably one of my top five Kinsella's books. Worth every minute.
B003Y6EL5W|4.0|I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did. It was fairly predictable but not entirely and the acting was unexpectedly good. You really do route for these underdogs even though sometimes they aren't behaving any better than the obvious badguys. I am looking forward to seeing the sequel.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A compelling read. A page turner until the very end. I like her raw characters and writing style. It kept me thoroughly interested and ready to read the other two novels.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|If you like Mahjong you'll like this. There are several backgrounds, layouts and theme to choose from and levels to accomplish
0440237688|4.0|This book has been reviewed so many times that it almost seems silly for me to add another review. That said, I will keep it short.<br /><br />This is an excellent book full of themes and meanings on life. It's incredibly thought-provoking. That's why my professor chose this book for class to read, and why many teachers in general choose this book.
B0036FYO12|5.0|Must admit, I didn't really appreciate it at the time, but watching it again made me realize who truly superior this film is.  Wonderfully written with a tight, clever script.  Redford, Dunaway and Von Sydow are at their best.  It avoids all cliches and packs several true surprises.  Well worth a second look.  DEFINITELY worth a first one!
B000VUCIZO|4.0|But Woz explained his processes well enough that I could get a pretty good idea of how things inside computers worked, which was impressive.<br /><br />Mostly, though, I enjoyed his zen engineer view of life as well as his stories about his relationship with his dad and other key men in his life. The women, including his mother, sister, wives and daughter, were much more in the shadows.<br /><br />Overall, an enjoyable and informative read for a regular non-techie type reader.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|this movie was made for 3 d ! wanted to see it in the theater to get the full effect but never got to see it ordered this movie same time i ordered second pair of 3 d glasses and they came on the same day
1439156816|5.0|The best book on writing I've read. It also serves as an interesting, heartfelt short autobiography of King's life.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|A great premise. Love the setting of high IQ and the characters are out of this world. Very entertaining. Carter and Joe are law enforcement. Carter has normal intelligence, but is uncanny in his ability to piece puzzles back together. Joe is hardcore ex-marine and smart to boot. Keeps the storyline moving.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Pretty good read. Didn't care for the ending. It should have been like the old goosebumps books where you can pick an ending!
B0000C3I6U|5.0|I think this a good gift if your boyfriend or husband lifts. Do you even lift? Then this could be good for you too. Very interesting and fun to watch. Who doesn't like Arnold? Wait, don't tell me. I don't want to know. He's a cool guy.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This continuation makes getting through book four worth it. All of my favorite characters are back, and I'm turning pages at record pace. Read this one for sure!
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I wish the straps that can fasten around your waist were removable. I think I will have to cut them off. I do not go up mountains or hang upside down, so I do not need those.
B00ESY827C|1.0|Very boring movie. Dragged on way too long and is tied together by narration like they are reading a book to you. Waste of time.
0684857219|5.0|This is just an impressive, huge, HUGE book. It weighs as much as a few gradually progressing biceps. A must have for anyone who is working on their physique in a big way.
B007SGM084|4.0|I will happily admit that I have read these books at least 4 times now, and have every intention of reading them again in the future.  This is a great love story with a modern, dark twist, and I would recommend them to my friends.  My only complaint is how unrealistic some of the material is.  I mean, coming from a woman who's actually had sex before, I know that there's NO way I could have an orgasm just from someone sucking on my toes or pinching my nipples, and I'm willing to bet that I'm not the only woman who's read this and thought the same thing!  Other than that, they're a great read, and my husband definitely enjoys it when I've started reading them again.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I've read negative reviews everywhere about people complaining The Mortal Instruments series being just another Twilight craze. Where is this coming from? When I finally cracked open my copy of City of Bones and did not get Twilight anywhere. This was a well written book with a great plotting that I enjoyed from the beginning to the shocking ending. Yeah, there's a bit of a forbidden romance, but to put it at the same level as Twilight? That's a bit much.<br /><br />First of all, the sparks between Jace and Clary were no doubt a large part of the novel, but unlike Twilight, it didn't dominate the plot at all. To be honest, I found City of Bones more like the SciFy Chanel's tv series Lost Girl than Twilight. And I found &#34;the Institue&#34; similar to Harry Potter's Hogwarts. Maybe I'm overthinking things. Maybe it's not about story simiularities. Why do some of you Mortal Instruments dislikers compare the series to the Twilight Saga? The inappropriate &#34;romance&#34; between two main characters? I'd love to know!<br /><br />So why did I like this book? Well, it's not my favorite book, but I found all the cryptic remarks leaving me curiouser and curiouser. In the beginning, I felt like it started out strong, but in between the action-y parts, there were a few too many lulls in the plot for my liking. However, the romance brewing between Clary and Jace left me wanting more. I was also interested to know who was really behind the disappearance of Clary's mother and what it had to do with the Infernal Cup.<br /><br />By the end of the book, I was second guessing everyone who came in contact with Clary. I was so surprised (if you've read the book, I'm sure you can insert a more appropriate adjective) by the outcome of Jace and Clary's relationship—and really the entire book—but I'm fully expecting the author to give us more insight into Valentine's history.<br /><br />It's easy to dismiss this series as another author jumping on the teen angst fad lead by Stephenie Meyers, but I think I'll just wait to see what happens in the next books in the Mortal Instruments series. Until then, I'll gladly recommend this book to any fantasy or young adult fans that like a little variety in their supernatural characters.ie Meyers, but I think I'll just wait to see what happens in the next books in the Mortal Instruments series. Until then, I'll gladly recommend this book to any fantasy or young adult fans that like a little variety in their supernatural characters.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|INTENSE, DANGEROUS, ADDICTIVE!!!<br /><br />All three of these words from the synopsis above are the best description there is. OH MY GOODNESS!!!<br /><br />It has your oh so good girl, (does it?) and oh so bad boy (or is he?), a new year and first year of college, to start new and free from past. (Oh can they?) Romance, intrigue, suspense, and a bet between these two amazing characters. What more do you want?<br /><br />But I will say at this time some of the writing was a little risque for the younger side. On the other hand it was very well written. Author Jamie McGuire has hit this one out of the ball park. Left me wanting more and my emotions all over the place. And I will diffidently read more of her books.<br /><br />Cover: Awesome, and I would buy this book because of the cover alone. I love that it, to me anyway, that it describes the book as someone or thing caught in something and wanting out so they can live, or if staying in there well undoubtedly end in death.<br /><br />Plot: Very creative and refreshing, but also edge of your seat addictive!<br /><br />Characters: Well written and very creatively done. A love hate relationship with all of them.<br /><br />Ending: NO WAY!! I WANT MORE... but leave the crying for some other book.. (just kidding there) can you say \\"Cliff-hanger.\\"<br /><br />So there you have it for my thoughts on this book and author.<br /><br />And for those reasons, I am giving this book and author my Breath of Life Rating:<br /><br />FIVE CLOCK RATING!!<br /><br /> Disclosure: I did not received the above book in exchange for my honest opinion and review. Opinions are my own and yours may differ.
B00756GRUE|5.0|very happy with all the features except the stop watch only goes up to 60 minutes...No real complains ever with any Seiko I have ever owned.....I have a 40 year old divers model that has never let me down.....
B000P42A22|5.0|The real, published history of the CIA is available in bits and pieces, but due to the nature of the activities the actual operational techniques will never achieve full public disclosure.  This is in part ironic, because our so-called 'enemies' probably have more knowledge of our covert activities than we do via their own counterintelligence services.  Nevertheless, the nastier stuff has been investigated by the Church Committee and several determined authors in the years between 1977 and the advent of Wikileaks, citing FOIA to obtain references - often blacklined.
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|Robert Redford truly embodied the true character of Gatsby. Leonardo Dicaprio was good but slightly akward in the role. I actually saw the current version first since its my generation. I became intrigued with the story and decided to watch the one with Robert Redford. Wow, Redford was amazing! So smooth and collected yet you could see the  longing in his eyes for what once was. Too me he was perfect in everyway.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I love this game and I got one for my husbands Kindle also.  One BIG problem..  just when you getting to your highest score it stops and tells you game is finished.  I've made it into the 30's level twice and now anywhere from tens through 20's it stops and says &#34;game failed&#34;. It's very, very frustrating.  I want to throw the thing away!!!!  Big problem as we love the game....

B00992CF6W|5.0|the graphics are good doesn't glich and is really a good game for children and great for tablets. you should get this game
B001XULSG6|4.0|If you like Star Trek, there is nothing that this review is going to tell you that you don't already know. It's a top 5 Star Trek movie for every trekkie out there. The Borg were one of the coolest adversaries in Star Trek lore, and this movie is chock full of 'em!
0061733199|5.0|I think it is one of THE most important books on survival. I carry it in my pack and read it all the time. The only problem I have with it is He doe's not really give a good explanation of tools and where you might get them. I tried to look some up online and they didn't go by the name he had gave. but, all in all, I wouldn't trade this book for any other.

B000VK99Z6|5.0|This was an amazing dark comedy - not at all what I expected.  Much smarter and more witty with a touch of Monty Python's randomness and obsession with death.  Violent in an hilarious and goofy way. Also really cool to see the Nazi bad guy from Rocketeer again!!
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|I quite like the visuals of the futuristic movie. Karl did a fairly good job as Judge Dredd a marked difference from Sly

B004XUMMFE|5.0|Just watched all the episodes, fantastic show.  Really seems like it had legs plot could have been unlimited.  Never should have been canceled!
B002HSSAY6|4.0|The movie was very good but a bit slow; that's my reason for not giving a it s 5 star.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin has a very natural, fluid style of writing, so this is a book the reader is pulled through, rather than having to push.  The subject matter is fascinating, not only those parts dealing with war and politics, but others covering personalities and relationships as well.  Most of all though is the portrait of Lincoln that is developed throughout the book; perhaps other authors have done as well, but it's hard to imagine any better.  At the end, you just gotta love him.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I liked it. Very well written although at ones I had trouble keeping all of the characters straight. I liked the middle of the book best! I will definitely read the other novels he wrote
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This movie was probably one of the best movies I've seen this year. The cast is outstanding and the storyline is just as good.

B00BX8PG5M|4.0|This is a low budget flick , and it's a good one. Mainly because of the strong acting of the cast. They are just EXCELLENT. Ed Harris has never put in a bad performance in his life; but the rest of the cast rises to the challenge here. This is drama and not a action flick really so VIDEO GAME IDIOTS WHO WANT constant action should avoid it probably.  Instead it is a tight drama based loosely on the story of the k-129. That sub did in fact go rogue and was taken over by the kgb. The crew sabotaged the nuke missle and it blew up and killed them all.  The kgb was trying to fire it on Hawaii. ANd they were trying to convince the americans that it was china doing it. That is very similar to this movie. I do believe the k129 deserves a monument for what they did too. This flick is great while it's in the sub as it's a real sub and that makes it more realistic.  the ending is more metaphysical or spiritual , but I didn't care as this was a good drama. And it made me think about the k-129 and what they did for all of us.  David ducoveny is outstanding in this too as the kgb rogue agent.  He gets more fanatical as the film moves on.  The computer generated effects are average here and would have been top notch 15 years ago, but you can forgive them that because they just had such a small budget. In fact models would have looked more realistic but that would have cost a lot more. So forgive them that and just enjoy the excellent acting.  And William fictner really helps this flick out too. He's another actor that never has given a bad performance. So that helps in this movie too.  I just hope that this movie inspires someone to create a monument to the crew of k -129 , they saved the world!  And they deserve the recognition for it.
B0002F6AH0|3.0|The sound is very garbled. It could be that my TV is only an 26&#34; HD. The DVD's were made in 1974 and they state that they<br />were made with the latest technology available. The stories are very interesting they take you from when Hitler's armies were<br />unstoppable to their wreaking and  eventual defeat.
B00BQLSB3A|1.0|this company is releasing a lot of great movies. And all of them are sony catalog films. sony is too lazy to put them out  like other companies are doing.  So many great films are just not available to the viewer because they only put out a small number of blu rays. and even worse they are all 30.00.  I realize this is a small company but I would love to get many of these older films like major Dundee , and the others that this company put out, I have three of their titles and they are of course gone and out of print now , so you can't get a new one. but other companies are putting out vintage movies and they just keep them in print, and don't do limited runs.  this strategy is faulty because if you sold these older flicks for 15.00 you could easily sell 3,000 or more. Oh well. I love Christine though but thanks to sony and this company I can't get one on blu ray.
B009GX69RK|5.0|Favorite new show hands down! My girl's and I love watching it. We are so ready for Season Three! Zoe D is hilarious.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I really did enjoyed this book , can't wait to see if the movie can come close to the story.
B00E0MCYPS|1.0|If the developer can fix the tilt control so that it responds well, they will have a winner here.  As it is, the game repeatedly puts you in a position where you can not possibly respond fast enough, tight turns should be challenging, not impossible.
B008IGP8RI|2.0|I was expecting a CD like the soundtrack to Cold Mountin. The music of Lawless didn't flow right and didn't remind me of the movie.
1451695195|4.0|To have a trained doctor have this life changing event happen to him,to share with us was a treat.Found it to be uplifting!
B00ARAO1LC|2.0|Kind of weird and strange - also depressing not one of Matthew's better movies.  Pretty violent and depressing, would not recommend.
B0012PDVUS|5.0|This movie has always had a special place in my heart and always will. A classic that will last for generations.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is the most amzaing game ever you get this game if u like subway augers. so get this game like I said this game is awesome
B008JFUQ16|5.0|I thought this movie was better than the first. So cute and funny! By the way, the ending is the best!
B004ADF7RO|5.0|This has been something I have watched and enjoyed since I was a kid. It is a great little adventure film!
B00005JNS0|5.0|It was great, my family really enjoys it, my kids watch it every weekend lol  👍we are very satisfied customers
B005XT10YS|4.0|I did enjoy this movie, however, the ending is sad!  However, the actors did a wonderful job and made it memorable!
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|This game was fun to play and it has several different images to choose from i really enjoyed playing the different ones.
1451683405|5.0|Short book but very interesting and informative.  I like Sam Harris and his succinct way of explaining complex philosophical concepts.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read. I hope that I can get the next on the device and I strongly recommend it
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Patterns are small and difficult to see, they are a little small. The game itself is quite fun to play.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a very addicting game and I just keep playing it. It is my 5th favorite game and I love the levels it is worth downloading
B00915G6SU|5.0|THANKS AMAZON. JUST RECEIVED MY ORDER, IT CONTAINS ----TWO----- DISCS ONE AND TWO,-----ONE DISC----FIVE AND SIX, AND NO DISC -----THREE AND FOUR----<br />HOW THE HELL CAN I MAKE AN OPINION AND HOW DO I GET YOU TO SEND ME DISC THREE AND FOUR.<br />VERY FRIUSTRATED...<br />Sally M.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|A very disturbing story. It was a who done it that l had figured out half way through the book. I would not recommend this book to any sensitive person. I only finished it because I had to see if I was right.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|I Liked it, it was funny it is nice to see all the characters in one movie thrown together each one with its strengths.
B009AY04A8|3.0|I don't like that if I try to zoom in or out it minuses 20 seconds. Otherwise it is fine. Also I like the graphics.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|My first introduction to this artist. I was blown away! This album was full of so many great tracks. I can't believe what I have been missing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great and easy to follow even my 8 yr old horse loving daughter and 12 year old son love it as do I
B002QP145C|5.0|Movies that are this long had better give up the goods,and even tho its in sub-titles it has its own kinda kinky Gore war<br />stuff that any real war movie buff wants,come on ya know you want it, over all its worth having has an over the top ending<br />two thumbs up !!
B0053JJLLC|4.0|Fast paced, unexpected twists and good characters. Good story. A suitable final book from Chrichton. Preston did a nice job finishing the book.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|We have been using this dictionary for some time now and find it to be easy to use. The search feature works well, and the fact that the app will pronounce the word for you is a great help at times.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|I loved this moving and laughed the whole way through. Great writing, clever animation, creative story line combined with fantastic cast. Enough said.
0394533054|5.0|This was my first existentialist novel, and I must say, I'm impressed. Absurdism is something that's highly appealing to me. Albert Camus is crazy talented.
B00DPH7QFM|5.0|This is a great representation of this ERA of Blackmore's career! Doogie White was a fitting vocalist for Rainbow in this time! Like I ready here already they play with great energy. Highly recommend this show!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Ive always wanted an app based on the movies and this is what ive been waiting for!! Works perfect on my kindle fire . I would recommend this for anyone who likes bananas or minions.
0307346617|5.0|I quite enjoyed this novel.  It was, by far, the best zombie apocalypse book I have ever read, and I have read a few.  It isn't an immersive adventure - you don't follow the lead character around as they survive the terrors of the undead uprising.  Rather, it's a chronicle that follows many different threads to show how the zombies rose, how the humans survived, and what happened after, which was great because most zombie/apocalypse stories don't follow through.  Sure they have a happy, or unhappy, end, but what comes after?  WWZ does not leave you hanging.  It is a complete history on its own.  I do recommend it if you enjoy end-of-the-world drama like I do.  Max Brooks is okay in my book.
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|4 stars<br />Terrible ending recommend I think I'll read the second book and it will explain what happened at the end.
B0081336FO|5.0|The only problem is that there are too few episodes per season! Well, that, and the the fact that we have to wait so long for season three is a little frustrating as well.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|Very challenging but not impossible.  Only problem I had was  when you<br /> drag your finger over the buttons it would not go to right buttons that you are touching.  When it works right it is fun.
B007FDE4Y8|5.0|The Opteka SteadyVid PRO Video Stabilizer System is very stable! I normally would have very shaky videos holding on my hand, but this stabilizer makes everything a whole lot smoother. At first, it is hard to adjust the weights and the position on the quick release plate, but after practicing for about an hour, you will master it! I really recommend this product to anyone who wants professional looking videos for such a low price!
B001EC3JME|3.0|Got this holster for an LED flashlight and it almost fits. If you work at it you can get it in the holster. The light is one inch in diameter. It is a zoomzble light and that is all messed up when potting in holster or removing from holster.  One thing for sure is it wont fall out.
B005IDXIL2|5.0|Love the 3D effects and lack of ads!  There are a lot of options to choose from too, like pin and ball colors.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I am 10 years old, My mom brought this book for me on my Kindle Fire Hd This book is so funny I love reading Diary Of A Wimpy Kid It`s entertraining and<br />Awesome I recommended to everyone in the World
B007GCY8FS|3.0|The books starts out promising and then take a turn for the slow and boring. The only reason i kept going wascto find out what happens
B005JTAP4S|5.0|Peter: A darkened Fairytale is a wonderfully written story about a young boy and his travels into a land full of surprises. Mr. O'Brien captured my attention early in the story with his vivid but not overboard details, allowing me as a reader to walk by Peter's side. There was no time to become bored with this story as each page represented a unique aspect of Mr. O'Brien's imagination. I must admit, I love the scene where Peter encounters the dragon, reaching his hand into the unknown. Yikes!<br /><br />I love the way the tail was ended! Full marks for this escapade.
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|So after reading several other reviews I decided to just go for it and try this game. Thanks to one reviewer I knew you can change the kind of controls you play with. So I tried them all! There's definitely a difference between them. The part of the game I liked best was the instant replay, you can watch your race and see what you did. I have never laughed so hard, I was all over the place! I also like that you can change the view of the race you see and can choose to automatically gas or not. To me it is a great beginners racing game. I really liked trying all the different controllers to See how they work. All in all I enjoyed this game!
B00AECGQF2|2.0|This game is pretty boring.  The functions are pretty basic and very limited.  This game should be for per-school children.
B00CZAYNOC|4.0|Great album by a great band.  Can't wait for their next one.  I definitely recommend this to any one that is a fan of metal.
B000006U44|4.0|The sound quality its good and I like kate bush I have the cassette format before and its broken already
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Hosseini's writing style and vocabulary is outstanding.  However, the story wanders a bit in places and the many characters sometimes become confusing.  I enjoyed the book, but did not love it as I did The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns.  It is still a good read and I would recommend it.
B000002J2D|4.0|I am  a fans of Genesis I have this album in cassette and its broken already. This CD have better quality compare to cassette
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I absolutely love this series and can't wait for the last book to come out next year! Just as the previous books, there are quite a few curveballs thrown but that's to better create tension. I wanted to rip my hair out at times because of the lack of communication amongst the characters. The fact that Sebastian is still in the picture is still torturing me. The powerful yet fragile love between Jace and Clary is so sweet yet saddening at times. Super thumbs up.
B000002J29|5.0|I am a fans of genesis the second out album that is the most I like. The sound quality is awesome
B00B19G01C|2.0|Generic despite Kyra Sedgwick and Jeffery Dean Morgan.  Since they are both good actors I'm not sure how that happened.  Crappy script, crappy director, crappy producer?  By the way, how on earth did they make JDM look so very much like Brad Garrett?
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was wonderful! Can't wait for the movie! I couldn't put it down!! A must read!! A must buy!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Love this book. Helped me get such clarity on using my own inner sense to live. Would recommend over and over!!!!
0321934318|5.0|Still reading it, a lot of info but easy to understand. Must have book for anyone starting out with Lightroom and needs the fine points brought to their attention
B005HED11Y|4.0|Season 2 is much better but for a beginning series during this time frame of TV series, this one is good and worth watching.  I enjoyed the remastering and was intrigued at the development of the characters by the cast.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I haven't read any review of this book before buying it so I was really surprised when I started reading it and could not leave it before the end. I love it.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|The Alchemist is an excellent book written by Paulo Coelho.  The story helps us explore our own meanings and destinations in life.
B004XZR63M|5.0|I loved this book .this book emphasizes more on the psychological view of how one should handle his/her finances .definitely a must read for all students and middle class ..
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Fun to play both my partner and e joy playing this and help each other out when stuck. Objects keep moving if you replay the levels
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Really good book. Keeps you guessing and if your 40-60 good book makes you think.<br />Although I do find it hard to believe; but I read for pleasure-
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Based on the reviews I read here and the one I read in People magazine (at the doctor's office - not my standard fare) I bought this.  If you're a fan of Maeve Binchy type books you'll enjoy it.  I thought it took to much blah blah blah to get to the &#34;secret&#34; and  it was a very basic story after that.
1600242197|5.0|The story about Seal Team 10 is great it tell you about the men in those teams. And how the teams works together as one. Myself a retired Forcerecon Marine I really unstood about the training and team spirt.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved the entire Silo series - at the end there was so much material left I thought please 'Don't Stop'
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game!!! Most adorable and fun game ever. I'm well in my 30's but huge Despicable Me fan. Plus it's free, so you can't go wrong.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Fantastic, excellent acting, great writing. Have not been hooked on a series in a long time<br />Already bought season two and three<br />Well worth investment
B00821OX98|5.0|Very intriguing show. I got all caught up in it so much I couldn't wait to see the next episode
0440237688|5.0|This book arrived on time and was great me and my daughters read it over the weekend.  Can't wait for the second in the series
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Has to be one of the best shows on television!  Great cast, great writers and NO COMMERCIALS!  If you havn't seen it - DO IT NOW!!
B0068PHS5Q|2.0|Although I felt I ought to finish reading to the end, I was glad to reach it.  It lacked substance, and was unbelievable.
6302477751|5.0|I've been checking out the Frankenweenie VHS tape from stores (when there were stores) for years and sure wish I could buy it on DVD. The eerie black and white film infused with human actors and a real dog is just amazing. I've seen only trailers of the animated version, but it just seems too easy. Sure animation is a painstaking, time-consuming art form that I appreciate, but it isn't real. The original movie is real. I cared about the characters. I cried. And I said about the movie, 'How did they do that?!'
0345803507|3.0|This book is a quick read, and is a good book. Not as great as what it was hyped up to be in my opinion, but still a good book.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorites.  So sad it was cancelled after only 1 season.<br />What were they thinking!?!
B0040GURF8|5.0|I find myself losing all worries when listening to John Mayer. There is something in his style that just takes me to a higher place!  Love! Love! Love this album so much!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I was not disappointed with this third book of Mr. Hosseini because he kept the tension taut throughout his story.  It took a little time to connect the characters when reading, but he eventually revealed their relationship beautifully through his complex plot.
B00DJWV11I|2.0|one of those I could leave  for a couple of days and not think about it.  Some say its funny; I'm still waiting for the funny part.  it must be me.  Maybe I need to read a little more at a faster clip to get to the funny part.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My two daughters love this game.  One of them is almost 7 and the other just turned 3.  They play the game in different ways, but both absolutely love it.  Sometimes they even involve me.
B009KY5OGC|3.0|My expectations were very high for this book but I found it a bit pedantic and reptitious. Very worthy and important to give the Indian side of the All American success story but not a page turner for me
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|When I bought this I thought it would have it's own apps or could be used with the app store but sadly no.  It will only stream from a chrome browser which means you actually need two devices to watch anything.  Maybe in time google will add more value to it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love love pinterest! pinning is my new addiction. you can find it all there. from home remedies to party ideas.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it!!!!!!  I want to get the second book and maybe the third as soon as I am able to.
B00622D3BS|3.0|The movie trailer looked good and showed promise with Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling as the main characters.  However, the movie lacked a good story line and the comedy was sparse.  I was hoping for more with the high reviews it got.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was an amazing story about a difficult subject matter. It was told with sensitivity and compassion. It would make a great movie!
B004LTA9MK|5.0|Package arrived sooner than expected and is a great value.  Of course I opened it.  Music is for listening and t-shirts are for wearing!  Totally satisfied!!  Great historic concert, mementos you can enjoy and I have a new 'Bob' t-shirt, too!
B0094LUH4A|5.0|The story is something I can relate to as one who has a drive and standard and see life as something precious. I could understand the deep love and yet the disconnect that occurs when two people in a marriage do not share the same level of commitment and sense of mission.
B000GCFX3Q|4.0|My first introduction to the Walsh Family series of books, which are beloved by my friends. Can't wait to go on and read the rest.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I really don't like a lot of nonsense and maybe I was just too tired.  I played it for grandchildren and felt I had made a mistake --- too dark!
B005VPP4WS|5.0|I bought this DVD out of chance because I had recently bought Lady Gaga's latest single 'Applause'. Taking a instant liking to the track, I later proceeded to buy her debut album \\"The Fame\\", her follow up EP \\"The Fame Monster\\" as well as, her most current full album release \\"Born This Way\\". Being a casual music lover, I always like the sense of expanding on songs by seeing them performed in a stage show. To me, it gives the song new life. Anyway, with that in mind, and having become addicted to the songs on each of the 3 albums, I bought the DVD. I have to say, to have not been a fan of Lady Gaga before purchasing 'Applause', I was immensely impressed with her capabilities. The show is captivating beginning to end and I won't spoil that by rambling off on any details and specifics. If you like pop music and concerts, this DVD is for you. All I'll say is, you WILL NOT be disappointed!
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|As we get older it is sometimes interesting to see an older person's point of view.  I liked the common interest and their efforts to sustain that interest with the talents they still possessed, though diminishing.
B001NLKSI4|4.0|Not exactly sure why the two Wolf books were so mesmerizing to me, but blew through both in a couple of days.  The writing style is engaging and the story starting with book one is pretty amazing.  A fun read!
B001P7HUF0|4.0|We like the Grisham movies and feel they are well done. My husband watched this and would never write a review but I'm sure he enjoyed it.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Very good movie good acting and good special effects. I would recommend it anyone who's into the whole end of the world story.
B006G35EEC|5.0|Totally delightful!  Loved the acting, story and family values.  It's one I would love to own as I never tire of seeing it
B006M4F67A|4.0|Luv luv luv the game. Wish there were INSTRUCTIONS, to explain why tiles freeze or do not vanish.Luv 24-7 solitaire also.
B009157BWU|4.0|Very nice and enjoyable DVD story. If you love Chimps like I do then you must see this.<br />ENJOY!!!<br />Starr
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green has touched my heart forever.  This book alone made me smile like i have never before and to cry from sadness and happiness.  It has accomplished a great deal in my life.  I hope it will in other too.
0345423496|5.0|This is a fast read and very absorbing.  Frank is found and resurrected.  Of course he and Bowman have to get together again, in a way.  Just read it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I had to read this book for school and it was amazing!!!!!!! it dealt with death in so many aspects and now im takin glife differently.  enough said.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love the website and the app is just as easy to navigate. So much fun. Super easy to use. Definitely would recommend.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|You never know what is just on the next page sometimes it will surpeise you. Don't stop reading if it makes you angry, that will change.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great app... not giving five because of the in app purchase, however if you have enough patience you won't be spending any real money
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It's a lot of fun and the whole family will enjoy playing. Just Scrat would pony up acorns more often.  Dion world looks to be great too.<br />I highly recommend this one and the price makes it even better.  Enjoy the hours of fun.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a lot of fun to take care of the horses and be able to participate in different competitions.
B00AHGSVKS|3.0|This was an ok read for me.  I suppose it is just not my favorite cup of tea.  I did manage to get through it which if it was not interesting, I would just quit reading.  Not my favorite book but might appeal to others who enjoy sci fi.
0786962984|4.0|Dungeon! was originally conceived and released alongside Dungeons & Dragons back in the 70s, and unlike the old edition of the RPG, had aged very well indeed.<br /><br />The gameplay has always been intuitive and fun, and each release has sought to bring something new to the original's formula. With this rendition, they've kept it simple and straightforward. The artwork and pieces are good, and the simplified instructions make the game far more accessible than it has been in the past; perfect for first-timers.<br /><br />The only aspect of this edition that puzzles me is the disinclusion of mugging, which was a great end-game changer in earlier releases that added a lot of tension to the last few turns. I'm sure the designers had their reasons, but it still seems like a missed opportunity to revamp an excellent feature.<br /><br />Overall, it's worth the asking price for a simple game a group of friends can sit down and play for a half-hour.

B00AB7HESI|3.0|Ok So I got this game,but I could not create stuff because there was no return button on the samsung galaxy 2.7 tablet.Please fix and I will give 5 stars.Thank you for listening.
B00EOO55GW|2.0|and the rest are pretty awful. I don't recommend it except for the hail to the king song and even it is &#34;popular&#34; sounding...
B009KWU6Q2|1.0|This is the lamest film I've seen this year. I could only get halfway through it, before I shut it off in disgust. A terrible waste of talent.
B004PYDBVM|5.0|Our idiotic President Obama wants to do the bidding of the Saudis and wage war on Syria while ignoring the holocaust going on today in North Korea.  Read this book to gain an appreciation of our Constitutional rights in the U.S.  Rights to protest, of free speech, freedom of the press, of religion, to bear arms; rights denied the subjects of the North Korean dictatorship.  Read it as a reminder that we must defend our rights every day or slowly we will lose them.
B006C67NP6|5.0|Can't tell you how many times I've used it when chords were needed. Was also useful when I didn't have the right transposition to a tune and with the chord I could still take my solo ;o)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is lots of fun to play.  Not too easy, not too frustrating.  I would to see more levels of this game or more games like it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Addictive. Addictive. Fun and time consuming. Addictive. I love to play coin dozed.  Addictive! Once you start you won't want to stop. Remember to pick up your coins regularly. Addictive.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book captures a specific set of experiences in a specific context while feeling universal (at least as far as the United States goes). I found myself staying up late to read &#34;just a few&#34; more pages.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I have meetings one Tuesday night a month and miss episodes.  Having the season lets me catch up on the ones I missed, and re-watch my favorites.
B00COCY67A|5.0|Excellent collection of music for all Elvis fans. Even being an Elvis radio subscriber, this is a must have collection.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Disappointed...expected more.  I think Jennifer Lawrence is extremely talented but I didn't feel this was memorable.  I wouldn't recommend to anyone.
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|I read the reviews before downloading and was a little skeptical but decided to download anyways since it was available for free. I'm glad I did. I would pay for this game if I had to. For the people who complained about the controls, I don't know if there is something wrong with your device or if you just don't understand rally racing, because the handling is great, it's better than in some console games I've played. There is a degree of difficulty but what fun is a game if it's easy to beat. Some people may want it to be easy so they can feel good about beating a game, but personally I think that if it doesn't take some sort of skill and is too easy then it's not worth playing. It seems like everybody just wants a \\"participation award\\" these days, so sad.
B008Q0AJA2|5.0|A novel concept put into play with the frenetic acting by Jim Carrey.  I thought that it was very well done and very entertaining.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|What can I say... I surely fail to be able to describe her artistry with the correct amount of recognition. A must have for anyone who enjoys a contemporary feel in music but doesnt need to be blown away with today's hard edge.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It was an enjoyable story that continuously seemed to pivot on such deep human character themes like honesty, sibling rivalry, bullying, love and friendship and life`s unfairness in both the human as well as the natural world.. I guess that would include xenophobia as well?<br /><br />I loved the people in the book.  Even the most-flawed were not without redemptive qualities.  To be honest, I am trying to get more people to read this book without giving anything away.  You do not need to be an afficionado  of science fiction to enjoy this book.  It should not be forgotten.
B00E13ZRFA|5.0|This is my new favorite song... Ellie has an amazing ability to capture and captivate your attention and never let go...
B004CURZFC|5.0|my name is Niki<br />  I fell in love with this movie. It teaches us how to treat others<br />  that are different than us. A great movie for all ages.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing bingo any way and anywhere.  I am not a fanatic, but, I do like to play the old-fashioned bingo games.
B00A4AI17A|5.0|Qality of recordings is excellent, and the casts are from the greatest opera stars.  Excellent value for the opera collector.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I can hardly wait to play it every day.  It definitely is challenging and fun.  I appreciate the fact that it is a free game.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Good game. Loaded okay. Fun to play. Like the story the game tells. Doesn't seam to crash. Haven't had any problems. Easy to play.

B001C34HUS|5.0|Intelligence and artistic talent are both known by making connections between ideas, perceptions, experiences, emotions and values that may be counterintuitive or not obvious. But once the connection is made, it is immediately clear that the connection is obvious.<br /><br />Young's classic lays out a five-step process for unearthing new ideas. The process is not necessarily easy and definitely not instantaneous. It will resonate with those who like playing with new ideas and will be fruitful for those who apply its process.

B005544TRQ|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from this series when I watched it because my favorite tv programs aren't available during the summer. I thought, who needs another series about corporate lawyers? I am relieved and happy to say that the dialogue is smart and so are the characters. The actors have an intensity that keeps you riveted to the screen.
B00AG297GK|3.0|This movie is ripe with one liners that are so stupid you have to laugh. It's one of those movies that require few brain cells to watch but like the three stooges sometimes stupid is funny.
B000HKYN74|4.0|The initial episodes of the season showed an inconsistency of design and theme, for example with T'pol's changes in hair style and clothing. It looked like the directors were looking for a way to draw in more audience, rather than sticking with a stable vision. L'var Burton's episodes were more traditionally set and designed.<br />The romance between Trip and T'pol could have been developed more consistently over the season as well, rather than hit or miss.<br />The overall season plot of the Xindi conflict was a good idea, and I especially liked the zombie Vulcans episode, an advanced story for its time.<br />In summary, though initially incongruous and directionless, the season settled down into a solid story, notable for its increased violence in the era of the Second Iraq War.
B00DXP0QX0|5.0|Thank God to whomever gave us these rare tracks of Rod Stewart in his prime. I just got this and am listening to it now. I have not had to skip a track yet. Yes, I have heard all these songs in their \\"album\\" versions, but to hear the alternate takes is amazing. I would definitely say if your passionate about your Rod Stewart musical collection, then this needs to 2 disc set needs a special place in your Rod music. It's also fun to hear Mr. Rod and the boys cut up in the studio.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|This was a good movie, though I must admit that I enjoyed the book more.  From a cinematic standpoint, the animation was fantastic and worth the iewing.  I watched this movie with my BF who had not read the book, so the ending took him by surprise.  The movie did follow the book fairly well, so if you haven't read the ook then I would definitely recommend seeing the movie.

The onboard &#34;Office&#34; app for the Kindle is (thus far) pretty useless.  This app, however, does everything I _thought_ the Kindle Office app would/should do.  For creating, editing, formatting and sharing docs, this is the best choice (imo).
B003YNFYCO|5.0|I showed my 3 and 5 year olds some youtube videos of the Beatles from the Ed Sullivan show.  After that they asked for a Beatles album every day until I bought this one.  Since i bought it, the kids ask to turn it on every day.  Within a few days they knew all the words to many of the songs, and the whole family sings them together. They also know who's singing on each song.<br /><br />What is it about the songs from the Beatles early years that make them so universally appealing 50 years later?  Music magic.

B000FC0SIM|5.0|This book is pure gold. Some of the best lessons for BEING  a writer (as opposed to every other book out there that teaches HOW to write) I have ever read. Actually, some of the most honest wisdom about creating art, period. I love that he paints a picture of how he came to his literary wisdom using the story of his own life and personal revelations.<br /><br />Now, Stephen King has a very distinct style of writing, and for any blooming writer, trying out his techniques and philosophical approach to writing could work for you, but by no means consider his way of writing the only one. He actually says this in the book  quite a few times.<br /><br />The only chapter that irked me was the one on plot. Though I understood where he was coming from, and  why he disliked it so much, I thought it was a bit heavy handed. For any novice writer, I'd say take that chap with a heavy grain of salt. Try his technique, by all means, but don't let it dominate what feels right to you, unless  of course, it does feel right, then dive in!<br /><br />Overall, this book is magic, his philosophies are magic, his wisdom is magic, and writing,  as he champions magnificently, is magic.<br /><br />This book taught me, quite possibly, the most important lesson of being an artist. And I'm positive it will for you too.

B00D2CYV9E|5.0|First of all the acting was superb !! Kudos to Michael Douglas and Matt Damon for transcending their characters into eccentric personalities.  The film was great in a lot of aspects set details, costume, cinematography, I just enjoyed every scene of it and never got tired, was even wanting for more.  But here is an excerpt of a great critic of the movie by Michał Oleszczyk<br />Cannes' Piano Man<br /><br />Behind the Candelabra\\" is a gloriously trashy title, one you can easily imagine being greeted with a dirty giggle by Liberace himself. Given that the man was extremely secretive about his homosexuality -- as well as litigious when it came to any public rumors of it -- he would probably have hated the idea of a film about him that focuses on his long-time relationship with a man named Scott Thorson. Still, the movie happens to be terrific (easily the best I saw in the Cannes competition this year), and does full justice both to Liberace's stage persona and his everyday humanity -- which got just about buried by the tons of glitter, pomade and frills he donned to give his audience pleasure.<br />Steven Soderbergh has based his movie on Scott Thorson's book of the same name, adapted for the screen by Richard Lagravanese. The story spans the final decade in the life of Mr. Showmanship, and follows a predictable tangent of a birth and death of a relationship. Thorson starts out as a friend, quickly becomes a toy boy, and then an actual lover of the man who lavishes gifts and affection on him with no sense of limits. Once Liberace starts interfering with Scott's looks in order to make him into the son he never had -- complete with cooking up a legal adoption -- bumps in the road start appearing, leading to infidelity, break-up and a lawsuit.<br />What makes the film special is the absolute precision of Soderbergh's direction, as well as a genuinely great performance by Michael Douglas as Liberace. Somehow, \\"Candelabra\\" manages to both follow the formula of a biopic andgo way beyond it. It's a film about a real person that feels like it didn't need to be based on one at all. Soderbergh works from the inside out: his priority is the truth of human emotions, not factual accuracy. In fact, the latter seems to be mere collateral of the director's integrity; what matters most in \\"Behind the Candelabra\\" is a story of two men in a complicated relationship that brings as much joy to them as it does anguish and pain.<br />Liberace's first appearance in the film is handled masterfully: we see Scott and his sometime lover Bob (Scott Bakula) entering an L.A. nightclub, mid-concert. The pianist on the stage is seen in a long shot and remains out of focus. What we first hear is the easy stage banter he engages in, slowly working up his audience. Once we get a close-up of him, the whiteness of Michael Douglas' teeth is matched only by the keyboard his hands are effortlessly traversing.<br />His skin seems to be oozing tan all by itself; mascara looks like his natural secretion. Everything about him -- the frills, the glitter, the sparkling pompadour -- screams camp, and yet the flamboyant gayness of his act is mostly lost on the audience. \\"They don't know he's gay,\\" says Bob, hitting the nail on the head. Liberace's rise to fame came before the gay culture and sensibility seeped into the mainstream of American life, and thus his mannerisms remained somehow idiosyncratic and \\"pure.\\" He was the gay guy your grandma loved, mainly because she didn't have to think of him as gay. His flamboyance was seen as a function of his sensitivity; it was indicative of how difficult it was for this exceptionally tender and giving man to find the \\"right woman\\" who -- duh! -- must have been all he ever dreamt of.<br />As I walked into the theater to see \\"Behind the Candelabra,\\" I feared Douglas would come off as a summa-cum-laude graduate from the Meryl Streep School of Biopic Acting, which teaches amassing a bunch of gimmicks and passing it off as a role. Instead, Michael Douglas blew me away with the emotional truth of his performance, in which every seemingly imitative flourish stems from the inner life of his character. His Liberace is a man of infinite appetite and generosity. He's voracious in taking and lavish in giving. He's the ultimate sugar daddy with a heart of gold and an ego of steel -- the perfect seducer, who administers blows as often as he suffers from them himself. The film suggests it's his sweetly overbearing mom -- played by Debbie Reynolds, who perfected the part in Albert Brooks' 1996 \\"Mother\\" -- that was at least partly responsible for her son's near-pathological eagerness to please. When she dies midway into the film, the bereaved Liberace confesses to Scott, in a way that's both shocking and exhilarating, \\"I'm free.\\"<br />Douglas has always been associated with screen seduction. He was both the victim of it (most famously in \\"Fatal Attraction\\" and \\"Disclosure\\") and its borderline-sleazy enabler. His Oscar-winning performance as Gordon Gekko in \\"Wall Street\\" is the closest to what we see now in \\"Candelabra\\": both movies are about rich older insiders luring younger men, who crave a boost in status and a lavish life style. He is so subtle and alive in \\"Behind the Candelabra,\\" I believe he'll be leaving Cannes with a Best Actor award.<br />If there's a theme running through Steven Soderbergh's varied body of work, it probably has to do with performing as the ultimate expression of self. In his famous, Palm d'Or-winning debut, people talk sex and tell lies while knowing they were being videotaped. Given multiple levels of deception and role-playing that's usually involved in a Soderbergh movie, even the \\"Ocean's\\" series seems like an elaboration of that basic trait (there, the performance took the form of a heist). As recently as in \\"Magic Mike,\\" which focuses on the world of male strippers, Soderbergh shows both the sense of empowerment inherent in performing before an audience, as well as the possible trappings of becoming too caught up in its glamour. His latest -- and allegedly last -- movie serves as a great summation of that theme.<br />The film ends with an \\"All That Jazz\\" coda, in which Scott imagines Liberace's funeral as a follies-type performance, with his late AIDS-afflicted lover singing the ultimate chestnut of Broadway resilience, \\"The Impossible Dream.\\" As he struts his glittered frame around the stage filled with Ziegfeld girls, he looks like a star of a glam-rock band, except he's not out to titillate the audience, but to flatter it and please it. When he takes off and floats through the air, it doesn't come as a surprise at all. Show-biz enchantment came as easy to him as breathing, and -- at least in Soderbergh's movie -- lingers in the air even as the breathing had stopped.

B007MDQW3W|4.0|Regina Spektor is an odd sort of bird.<br /><br />She has given solo performances in international venues and has a substantial discography, yet she neither has that level of pop fame which performers are reputed to crave, nor do I believe she much aspires to it. Her music is more like that little cigar shop you discover in an odd part of town, a shop doing well enough for the owner, but which shows no symptoms of becoming the next Te Amo, part of whose appeal is that you discovered it, and that not everybody knows about it.<br /><br />This quirky honesty permeates her music, which seems to record whatever odd tunes and conceits have popped into her prolifically creative head, with the air that \\"If you like it, that's fine, and if you don't like, well, s'okay too\\": the results are often quite beautiful. But a side effect of this individualism is that a discovery of her oeuvre starting from a chance encounter with a single You Tube video - like a shard recording a fragment of the lost language of a Mesoamerican civilization - there are moments of annoyance mixed among the many minutes of pleasure.<br /><br />Like this CD, for example (drifting back to the topic): yes, every song is beautiful in its own idiosyncratic way, but is it this alone which makes the album always seem to be over a little before you wanted it to be - or is it the 37'19\\" playtime? Thirty seven minutes! I've accepted the idea that popular CD's clock in at around 45 minutes on a medium that supports 80, but I don't think I've seen any fall below the 40 mark before - the four minute mile of cheapness. I've been bamboozled into buying a CD more than half blank. But wait, this album is \\"...from the Cheap Seats\\" - maybe the joke's on me?<br /><br />Then (from another album, but I just want to review Regina Spektor once and be done with it), there is the crassly ugly and anti-American \\"Uh-Merica\\". Really!? To the long list of natural endowments rewarded by success, couldn't we at least add an honorable mention to the environment - to the \\"opportunity, land of\\", towards which her parents had the good sense to flee? I don't expect this circumstance to make Ms. Spektor a flag-waving patriot - nobody does that kind of thing much anymore - but must she turn and bite the hand which feeds her, like any common ingrate?<br /><br />But then, maybe this isn't an anti-American song after all. Maybe the deliberately grunting \\"uh\\" sounds, coupled to that most banal of anti-American standbys, that we are a nation of gun-lovers, is really a satire. Is this an anti-American song, or an anti-anti-American song? I don't know, and after the first wave of indignation, maybe I don't much care. I acknowledge the majority divinity of the Sybil, even if I believe that some of her oracles have failed of divine inspiration.mention to the environment - to the \\"opportunity, land of\\", towards which her parents had the good sense to flee?

A must see for anyone that likes action and hero type movies.
B0018BB20W|5.0|1967 was a phenomenal year for the concept album -- and really, the birth of Prog Rock -- for that year, two masterpieces of sound were released: The Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" and the Moody Blues' \\"Days of Future Passed.\\" While it's all in the ear of the beholder, for continuity and flow of thematic ideas, \\"Days of Future Passed\\" can be regarded (and listened to) as one complete work, from beginning to end, rather than \\"Pepper's\\" kernels of individual songs, which follow more of a string-of-conscious structure.<br /><br />This is by no means meant to diminish the brilliance of \\"Pepper, but in the true definition of a concept album, DoFP's framework is set with concise themes and in a chronological order -- morning, midday, dusk, and then evening -- therefore maintaining a progression of sound and ideas that can easily be taken in and understood as a whole. It is this sense of familiarity with the human experience and the daily marking of time, intermixed with the Moody Blue's romantic imagery and lush arrangements, that paved the way for yet another ground-breaking concept album -- arguably the greatest concept album of them all --that of course being Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" in 1973.<br /><br />Had it not been for \\"Days of Future Passed,\\" there very well might not have been a \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\" Because of this comparison, I've always regarded \\"DoFP\\" as the 'light Dark Side,' and consequently, the \\"Dark Side\\" as the 'heavy Days of Future Passed.' You be the judge.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|This game was developed to target a specific audience K and pre-k I would suggest that you start off with it pre-k if possible if not K would work fine. It uses puzzle games to help motor skills and problem solving skills alike. Seems to keep attention of my nephew who is pre-k fairly well. This is the 3rd purchase I have made for him through 22L each time he gets a new game he is extremely excited and spends lots of time with it. I will try other games from these guys as I find time and determine if they seem a bit too advanced or not. So far every game I have tried weather free or purchased it seemed to keep his otherwise short attention span focused and for a good cause. The purchased games seem to keep him a bit more busy as I have said but they contain more levels and puzzles which is understandable someone has to get paid to do work as difficult as programming or else we wouldn't see no applications.

034580404X|5.0|I had only heard about these books when my sister brought them to my attention, she lent me the first two and I burned right through them! The story is so devinely steamy and romantic, and the characters are perfect, at first I didn't know what to think of Ana, but I simply adore her, and Mr. Grey. I breezed through the first two books and had to have the third asap, I bought the trilogy used and it came wrapped in plastic like new! I only collect books I know I will read again and love to have around. My oldest sister read the series 3 times! And at first I thought she was strange, but after reading the series once I can see why. I am thinking of reading the series again before the movie comes out next year, and can't wait to see it, especially with the people they picked to play the characters! My only request is that the author should write the series from Mr. Grey's words, he is not so innocent ;)
B007SSEZNA|3.0|This is ok, but I don't love the interpretation, the parts left out, and the acting is just so so, and rather over the top at times.

0345806786|5.0|The shining<br /><br />Jack Torrance is a self destructive and haunted man. He's an alcoholic who uses the drink to placate the ever burning fires inside him. Where had this destruction come from? This downward spiral was one Jack had been down long before he took the job at the Overlook hotel. A job at the famous and grand Overlook hotel in the rural mountains of Colorado.<br />Thinking he's family will gain a fresh start and Jack will once pull himself and his life back together; he gathers his wife and son and he begins the stay with his family as the winter caretaker..<br />What was thought of as balm to the troubles of his past was really a catalyst to his, all of their undoing. It is almost as if the Overlook is a rage full living thing that feeds off the darkness of others. The Overlook picks and jabs and reaches in until there is nothing left but the blackness..<br />The story is also about an abused, hollowed out, frightened shell of a woman; who is still striving to save her son from her possessed husband.<br />And also, the story is about a very special little boy. A boy who shines. A little boy who knows things. He is our hero. This brave little boy who saves them all..<br />This story is not like the movie(s). It is an amazing story..the ending alone is by far so much better than the movie.. Read this book, I would say read it before you watch either of The Shining movies, but seeing as they're so popular, that'd be impossible..just read it anyway.

0143123173|2.0|After the first novel in this series, I was looking forward to  The Cold Dish.  Pretty disappointing.  It sort of plodded along, for a very long time, and it never hit its stride as far as I was concerned.  I'm going to try one more, and I hope it will be a lot better.
B008JFUO36|4.0|I'd actually like to rate the film a 3.5.  I'm a big fan of Tom Cruise and I liked the film... but I wasn't blown away by it.  It was interesting enough, but not the kind of action I expected.  I kind of felt like it seemed similar to 'something' I've seen before.  It was sort of a mystery/sci-fi movie.  It was a good film, though, and worth watching.  It's just not my favorite Tom Cruise movie.... but it doesn't make me any less of a fan of his!  Still love him and will continue to want to see his movies.
B001MUK7GY|5.0|This is a great collection to have. Granted, Batman 1 and 2 are the best in this anthology, having the other films doesn't hurt as it invokes some type of nostalgia from my mid 90's teenage years. This set is in-fact region free. I would have liked the disc label to have been typed in English, but the actual films are in English and the menus are in English too. All in all, it is a great purchase.

B008469DGY|1.0|This game gets boring fast, it's not even like playing real golf. more like a driving range simulator where you always use the same club and the game just varies the wind and distance. The only thing that takes even an iota of time to get the hang of is that you can put tremendous amounts of spin on the ball while it's in flight and literal guide it anywhere you want. And that's when the challenge of this game completely dies. Luckily I got it for free on a deal day. Don't waste your money on this.
B009NLC1D6|5.0|The acting was real and outstanding.  Gandhi demonstrated that when a person has a higher cause, that is good, and he is an example of what it takes to achieve the higher cause, and is willing to sacrifice everything for it, it creates a power that unites millions of others.<br />He took no credit for what he was a part of.  He recognized his weaknesses, but did not let them stop him from participating in the cause. A great example for all of us to follow.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I'm not going to talk about it and ruin it for anyone. I just really enjoyed this movie from start to finish. Give it a shot
1601253788|5.0|If you play Pathfinder, you NEED all the Bestiaries. There is NOW a 4th book. You should also go to:  [...]  & get Hero Lab for Pathfinder. It's not free & you will pay for the books you want to add, but you will have everything at your fingertips to create, level up, customize & print player characters, NPC's & familiars. Makes the game even better. But we still use the Bestiaries hard bound editions.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The title is my favorite genre, and Downton Abbey is the queen of this genre. Like virtually everyone else, I hate Thomas and I wish the Dowager Countess was my grandmother.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Graphics and response are great. This is my favorite Solitaire game. Get tired of advertisements but have tried other free and paid apps and this one is still my favorite.

B00E8TVHBA|5.0|My 7 year-old son loves to watch this movie.The theme involves teens but is innocent enough for a younger population.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Not a book I would share with my 79 year old mother!<br />Great book to get your mind of off your every day problems. A fun read.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I've Been playing this bingo game a while now. I really Like this game a lot. Good job guys! Keep up the good work.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is so entertaining.  The puzzles are challenging, but obtainable.  I would recommend this game highly to anyone who enjoys puzzle games.
B00E0MCYPS|1.0|The steering is clumsy. Everything else is great, but I really feel like this game is nowhere near ready. Faulty mechanics. There should be an wastewater steer, without a tilt, that actually simulates a real car. See: every other first-person racer ever made.<br />A waste of time.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|this was a pretty easy game but I liked it. I think it would be better if they gave more levels and f it were a little harder.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The people who made this game are awesome but the thing is we need a dog on<br />There because 1. They protect you 2. They hurt what I want to hurt 3. Dogs are a man's best friend so please put a dog in this game
B000A0GYD2|5.0|I watched this when it originally aired but did not really absorb it.  I spent a long weekend in bad weather watching the series again and it's fascinating, historic, educational and entertaining.  For those that are now growing up without a space program in existence, this may be the next best thing to taking them to Kennedy Space Center!
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|I enjoy your game. Two things--- too many monsters for the limited f ing skill level upon leveling up. Skills and strength are also limited to the power vs monsters.
1567184855|5.0|Very intresting book for anyone who is curious about past lives and the mysteries of the soul. It is a wonderful book to expand your mind and thoughts on the subject of souls. It is easy to read and It flows very well. It is written in a question/response style. I recommend it for sure!
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie was very well done. I read the book first and I noticed, like most movie from books, it was missing a lot of detailed things that was placed in the book. But as a whole I enjoyed the movie a lot. I seen it in theater and I ended up buying it on DVD/digital copy.
B000067FP8|5.0|This is the second installment of the classic tale of best friends fighting to save the world. I grew up with these movies and this movie may even be better than the first. It is set in New York and has much more comedy than the first. It is very entertaining and is a must for anyone who loved the original.
B005LJK3AC|1.0|Not a soft R with the f word every few seconds - watched 10 minutes then turned it off. Waste of money
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game keeps you on your toes every second of play. Awesome. I give Minion Rush two thumbs up, I would give it more, but I ran out of thumbs.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Really enjoy this game  However,  if you want to trade items as a &quot;guest&quot; you can't trade or chat.  You must connect w/Facebook who wants you to share all of your friends &amp; emails  I hate all of the notifications on FB &amp; not willing to do that to friends &amp; family &amp; certainly don't want to load their emails w/FB spam!  Too bad  because all the other elements of the game are good.
0062059882|5.0|This has come to be one of my favorite books. It is a good take on mythology and how it has evolved in modern times. This book is not for everyone but if you can make it past the first chapter then you will definitely enjoy it. One of Gaiman's best works.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|you gies will love it if you buy it you will see how good it is so buy and play with friends if you want
B00992CF6W|5.0|One of the best things I ever downloaded! The only thing that is bad is it glitches a lot. Other than that this game is the best! It has the best survival out of any block building I`ve ever downloaded. I recommend this game to anyone who likes survival/building games. It also has really good controls! It has creative, too. If you don`t like survival than you can play creative!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The book good but kind of sappy...reminds me of an NC-17 Twilight. The writing is not very good and the plot and story structure gets better after book 1
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I've just skimmed this for a book I would like to publish to kindle. It looks like this simplifies the process a lot, but I probably won't know for sure until I'm done. I am excited, though!
B009YQJ322|3.0|I didn't think I'd like the movie as much as I did.  I bought it more out of curiosity and the fact that the price was right.  Turns out I enjoyed it more than I thought.  No Oscar nominations, but decent fun.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|You can't beat Goonies.  Comical dialogue and ridiculousness is abundant over the course of their adventure.  Curious how they can find One-Eyed Willey so quickly, but then again it was the 80's.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Enjoyed the book....have short stories told by each of the characters.  At times seems disjointed unless one read the book all at once,
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game. I love it so much that I am going to have to get rid of it off my Kindle Fire as I am wasting too much time playing it. For a free game it is amazing. The games are not easy, so it's a good challenge. There are a variety of patterns and the tiles are clear and easy to see. I have had a problem once or twice not being able to differentiate whether a tile is free or not but for the most part this isn't a problem.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book was very interesting and made me cry a few times.  Never knew there was an orphan train. You really like the main character. I have told many readers to read this one.
B00DDU1T5E|4.0|I really don't know why previews reviewers say that it doesn't work on Fire 8.9, because it worked for mine.<br /><br />Now, if they meant that it doesn't support TV OUT, I have to agree with them, it is not supported. I checked the i-version and it does have that capability. That's my main complain about this software, otherwise, it works fine.<br /><br />After downloading the movie, I converted on the my local PC and my Fire detects and plays it just fine.  I was able to add the subtitles, as the movie was in italian and I wanted the english subtitles to show! Good stuff! Just have to select the Custom conversion and tweak it to your needs.<br /><br />Too bad about the TV Out, the app immediately stops once you plug in the wire, so that's why I took one stars off the review.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|i got this e book for my sons kindle, we loved it. he read the entire trilogy in about a week.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I thought I had rated this before now... I have been using SwiftKey for few years now. While I will try others as they come along, there us nothing that comes close. I am not the greatest typer in the world, so I find myself wishing I had this app on my pc.<br />The predictions are mind blowing. The autocorrect is near perfect. And the stats are fun to see.<br />If you are looking for a new keyboard thus is the last one you will try.<br />The tablet version is excellent too.
B003ASLJS6|2.0|Somehow, Pale Rider has stood the test of time. Critical and popular reviews are consistently positive and frankly I don't understand why. Pale Rider is the story of a gun-slinging preacher randomly coming to the aid of a small mining community in its struggle against a wealthy mining corporation. Every line of dialogue is cringe-inducingly cheesy, forced, and unnatural. The relationships between the characters are empty, hollow, and unconvincing--especially the laughable and awkward crush a 14 year old character has on the preacher. The plot itself is mundane and formulaic, with an ending that is sorely lacking in explanation and closure. The allusions to supernatural biblical elements are seemingly empty. There are no real hints or clues as in High Plains Drifter.<br /><br />I really like Clint Eastwood's typical emotionless tough guy character--but I've found he doesn't always work in cut and paste situations. Pale Rider just isn't a very good film--more like a forgettable, cheap TV movie than a Sergio Leone epic.
B0011B9FNK|5.0|excellent. period.  worth watching this whole series. at first i was doubtful but they did a good job with Daniel's replacement, i always thought daniel was kinda a weak link. the team can get only stronger.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I thought it was going to be a kids type movie....but it wasn't.  Enjoyed it much more than Guilt Trip.

B00CL68NOG|2.0|I've seen pictures that Barb played in and they were good, however, this was not one of them.  Perhaps if Hilarious was not on the cover....I wouln't have been so disappointed.  I was looking for a good comedy.  Perhaps in my old age my humor isn't up to date with what is considered funny.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is one of the best games I've played!  Great graphics, boards and the music is not annoying.  I will be playing this game quite often.  Great download.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|I loved how she wove the story, as she always does, romanically and I felt the story especially about the writers was glimpsing a bit of her own self. Intrigued till the end!

B0068THAGY|5.0|Fast action, drama, excellent.  Grabs the attention of tweens and adults from the first moments of the movie! One of the few movies I would watch again and again.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this game is fun. The only problem is I don't like the ads. If u like(love) horses this is the game for you.
B00E9PXI3S|1.0|I usually like Rachel McAdams in movies but this one was a little predictable and even with the twist at the end, I remembered some from the preview hadn't played in the movie yet.  To me, the plot wasn't clear.  The acting was horrible.  The scenes and wardrobe were eye catching.  There was a glimpse of Euro-trashiness at time. I'm not sure if I felt better that I spent $6.99 to rent versus paying $7 at the matinee LOL I should've waited for it to show on Lifetime or USA.  I should've been straight to video.  The preview I saw in the movies a few weeks ago had me hooked and hyped.  This was a complete let down. I didn't want to give it any stars, but the review made me in order to comment.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I absolutely love g5 games. They are so much fun and worth the money (: keep making them! The only thing that sucks is that I wish I had the money to buy all of them lol
B00CLL1UY6|3.0|I was lent this book for an honest review and I did enjoy this book. The story itself was superb, very interesting, covering the war etc and the story of little Sebastian was intriguing.<br />The following critique is my personal preference and to be honest, for most people this book would no doubt suit them to the ground and be a wonderful read.<br />However, for me the book lacked dialogue.  I found it a hard slog reading it namely because it was written mostly in narrative, like someone telling a story, a history book. But the bits I enjoyed the most were the bits where the characters talked and had conversations.  I loved those bits.  The problem for me was that this was a very minor part of the book and while I enjoyed the book, I also didn't.  Had the book had a lot more conversation in it I think I would have empathised with the characters more.<br />Having said that the book was very well written, it just wasn't what I like in a book.  At times it felt rushed, then at other times the story was at a normalish pace.<br />I do not like writing reviews like this because christoph has done a fantastic job with this book. But the writing style didn't endear me to the characters and then at the end it suddenly seemed to wrap up in a flash.<br />I did enjoy the book in part, the parts that were the characters living the story as opposed to me reading about the characters.  And I am sure that had the narrative been less and the dialogue more, than I would have enjoyed this book an awful lot more.
B00E97AZZK|5.0|A creative plot, great cast, and fresh! A must see! One of the better &#34;illusion&#34; movies I've seen in a while.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|If you love theater and musicals you will love this show. The acting is great and so are the songs.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|It was a wonderful movie. I would certainly watch it again. I cared about every character. Maggie Smith always delivers.
B002361MLA|5.0|When I am away from home  and needing a quick refresher to channel my thoughts -- or no thoughts --  I realized that I left  the book at home.  Now, with Kindle  as a companion I can reference this book and have immediate access to a meditation exercise or continue reading another book.  The material in this book is a sound addition to Tolle's  POWER OF NOW and it's applicable for those who are unfamiliar with meditation or wanting freedom from  &#34;standard&#34; or  &#34;organized&#34; meditations.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|I don't suppose anyone rents this thinking it will be a blockbuster action movie. It is simple fun. Think Hansel and Gretel at a Steampunk Ren Faire. Some of the effects are reminiscent of Army of Darkness, but that just adds to the campy charm. Just remember to enjoy it for what it is.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I use this mic in tandum with a portable amp. when playin my flutes. Produces a true,clear and clean sound. I recomend this for those people who want to use a lapel mic that has a lot of cord. The only drawback is if you forget to turn the power off at the power pack when done, what a pain to replace the battery at the very most inconvient times. Overall a great little mic.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|I saw the stage version in Toronto in 1995. This brought back so many good memories. The music was wonderful. Gerard Butler was, surprisingly, excellent singer. I thouroughly enjoyed it and will watch it again.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Very well cast.....great storylines and all round compelling TV.<br />Highly recommend the show to anyone who wants to see quality TV.
B000FBJF6Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  My friend in Italy recommended the series, so I downloaded the book to Kindle and read it on the plane.  It is not a heavy or intense book.  Sometimes I need something like that to escape.  I also think it gives a positive image to women.  I recommend this book.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Great quick read with enough suspense to keep you entertained. Good novel with a good plot. Read it...for sure you'll like it
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I was charging my Fire using my phone charger since the USB size was identical.  But, my Kindle wouldn't hold a charge for more than two days.  I was seriously concerned it needed a new battery pack.  Amazon tech support suggested this first; and VOILA like magic I can charge up and hold it for more than a week's worth of reading again.  Plus it say \\"Kindle\\" on it; so I don't have to label this charger to know it from the (seemingly several thousand) others.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|From the title, I was expecting a womens soap opera type of show and was pleasantly surprised. A well written, well acted &#34;Law and Order&#34; type of show.
B000007ODL|5.0|this cd contains some great tunes done in a classic style.  love it and recommend it to anyone.  clapton doesn't do 'cocaine' or 'after midnight' any better.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app. It allows me to have my books on my phone. Works wonderfully and never freezes ever.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This is an amazing story of a boy born in a North Korean death camp and his dramatic escape.  If you want to see what the future holds for us if the liberals have their way, this is the book for you.
B00004RF83|4.0|It flirts with the doomsday thriller, and certainly it explores topical end-of-the-world repercussions. But SEVEN DAYS IN MAY is more a political conspiracy thriller. It features two central figures, one of them our point-of-view character. USMC Colonel \\"Jiggs\\" Casey (Kirk Douglas) happens to be personal aide to 4-star General James Mattoon Scott (Burt Lancaster), the very opinionated Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. General Scott, a right wing extremist, cuts a polarizing figure. SEVEN DAYS IN MAY posits a highly charged political climate in which the Presidency is at its most unpopular.<br /><br />Poor embattled President Lyman (Fredric March) is this perceived weakling who's advocating a disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union, a proposed course of action that infuriates huge chunks of the American masses. Protesters demand the President's head and they rally around General Scott. Scott is vociferously against the cessation of the nuclear race. Might makes right. \\"Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition,\\" said some patriot. The general believes he has the people's backing. We see what happens when Col. Jiggs Casey, left in the dark, begins to suspect Scott and the other Joint Chiefs of Staff of planning to overthrow the government.<br /><br />I think everything good has already been said about this film, so I'm just here to echo everyone else's heaps of praise. Razor-edged suspense with consummate execution with thought-provoking themes. This is very much in director John Frankenheimer's wheelhouse, a perfect complement to his earlier political thriller, [[ASIN:B00020X88Y The Manchurian Candidate (Special Edition)]] (1962). Burt Lancaster submits a chilling performance as the \\"patriotic\\" military zealot, and he's got his buddy, Kirk Douglas, to thank for it. Douglas had wanted him on board this film project and so ceded the juicier role to Burt as an incentive. It's an all-around highly professional cast of actors, with folks like Martin Balsam, Ava Gardner, and Edmond O'Brien making a memorable impression in supporting roles. Rod Serling wrote the screenplay, and really all it required was one cautionary left turn of a twist for this movie to pass as an episode of Twilight Zone. Luckily, Jiggs Casey has got his thinking cap on, sniffing out a shady horceracing betting pool and, from that, unearthing an unthinkable coup d'etat.r, and Edmond O'Brien making a memorable impression in supporting roles.

B005HEJ2DK|4.0|This incarnation of Star Trek finally has focus.  After rambling through the galaxy for no reason for 2 years. This cast has a mission to shave the world and stop the Zindi how the do that is a great ride.
B004KA9UX4|5.0|Well written in an understandable tone. He makes few assumptions but you need a background in some western theory to really follow him. He relies heavily on the piano some a moderate background in the piano is helpful as well. I'm using this for self study and I'm primarily a bassist. I find this book perfect for understanding how to understand jazz theory and improve my playing. It's no wonder this is the book most often used in university courses on has theory. Well worth the cost.
B000FC146C|5.0|Never thought I'd like it. Loved every meticulously designed word! Felt like I knew the characters, and wanted to keep peeking in on their lives for generation.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|If you don't know whether you want to get the radio edit or the album version of this song, definitely go for the album version.  It has a great intro that the radio version doesn't, and generally you get two extra minutes of awesome.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|The movie is incredible but I'm sure most of you know that already.  This Blue-Ray had some great bonus features including a gag reel and a very insightful commentary by Joss Whedon.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Tech support is friendly and quick<br />This app has good graphics<br />My son is also learning some responsibility in animal care
B006C1DH92|5.0|All the great fruit cutting of the first game but with some different game play things you won't find anywhere else.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|Hilarious from beginning to end. Many unexpected turns in the plot. Uses irony, cliche and satire with hilarious results. Some really funny dialogue is so subtle that you can easily miss it. I will buy this movie!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I'm highly addicted to this game.  I'm so happy it was available for my android phone.  It's a fun game to play to kill some time.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|An Intense British Drama that keeps you hooked & coming back for more! It gives you a picture of life in England in the early part of the 20th century. Each character has his/her own endearing qualities.
B00E0MCYPS|2.0|this game has hard contorls it is really hard to stree the car. also it kind of got me motion sick as I was playing
B00640UICA|5.0|My daughter plays this game for hours.  She loves it.  So I'm happy with it.  I've played it and it is quite addictive.
0143120255|4.0|this is a neat, artistic book that can be consumed in 10 minutes. recommended for the true fan of both Paris and New York... in part because only a person who has visited both cities would understand the comparisons and in part because only a true fan should pay to own this.<br /><br />This book takes \\"concise\\" to the extreme with one word comparisons of each city on opposing pages.<br /><br />I still rate it 4 stars because i do love both cities and enjoyed the art (no photos) and quick read. Minus one star because had i expected any more than the ten minute flip through, i would have been disappointed.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I use this on my Android phone for reading stories to my 8 year old daughter.  The one star removed is for taking forever to first load after not using it for a while.  The app is wonderful for reading.  It makes it a pleasure to read with just flicks of the finger.
B000FC2L1E|3.0|Awesome second in the series,hope third is as good<br />It was entertaining, and held my interest, who got me started on this series?
B00821OX98|4.0|This is a solid houghtful sci-fi series.  It's well worth getting.The characters are well developed and the cinematography is very professional.
B0074QGGK6|3.0|A very quick read but unfortunately an uninspiring book,<br />There were no stand out tips. Sorry to be so negative.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|This is a surprisingly good film.  I found myself giving up sleep to see the finish. I you like a good hero action film this is worth viewing.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love this show.  I'd say this is what happens when you cross the witty mentor-mentee relationship of Dr. Perry Cox and Dr. John Dorian from Scrubs with the professional genius of House, M.D., then transport everyone to the life of corporate litigation.  The writing is amazing as well as the character development.<br /><br />Watch this show, you won't be disappointed!
0553296981|5.0|read it years ago and liked it.  darn thing says &#34;13 more words required.&#34;  the book came up in discussion and as a surprise gift I ordered it.  Same book and same plot it has always been.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Love this CD, but love Darius Rucker so no surprise it is wonderful. I  highly recommend it to anyone that likes DR or summer sounds or just fun stuff. Great sitting by the beach music.
074358158X|5.0|&#34;Lisey's Story&#34; started a bit slow at first, or so we thought, until you get 1/3 to 1/2 way in, you realize that you NEED all the setup and background information.  My wife and I both loved it, and actually listened to it twice -- just to make sure we didn't miss anything the first time!  Read it... listen to it... period!  &#34;BOOL -- The end&#34;!!
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|SPOILER ALERT! I start by stating that I like Tom Cruise in science fiction (see &#34;Minority Report&#34;) because he is not being &#34;Tom Cruise,&#34; (&#34;I must protect my wingman.&#34;).  The premise was interesting enough, and begs the question,&#34;If you were the only one in the Matrix, would you care?&#34;  The bleak scenery espouses the isolation the characters experience, and the technology is believable future tech, but the acting lacked passion.  Perhaps the casting of the clone wife with someone with an upper crust British accent and attitude could have been done with someone with more personality. Also, the fact that she too is a clone was a bit disappointing.  If she had been in on the deception, there would have been more suspense. But in the end, she had no control over her own behavior. It is only Cruise's flawed cloning, which leaves him with a thread of residual memory that nags him at night that something is rotten in Denmark, that opens the door to a resolution.  In this aspect of the story, I would have liked to seen more told from the scavenger's perspective.  All we know is that they took &#34;decades&#34; to find the ship with Criuse's real wife orbiting in stasis, but how did they know he was having memory dreams, and that the sight of his lost love would 'awaken the sleeper'?  We assume there were at least 52 clones, obviously necessary to cover the Earth.  Perhaps they captured one.  It would have nice if Mr. Freeman's character had told us, as Morpheus told Neo of the first person to escape the Matrix. In the end, Oblivion was an pleasant diversion, but not one I would repeat.  It's no Matrix.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you got time to kill this is the game for you fast paced and colorful great for all ages have fun
B002JXK5VU|3.0|If you want an escape after a busy day, this show is a good one to watch.  It is entertaining and fun with some quirky characters.
B00C6B9H46|4.0|I remember seeing this film for the first time in theaters, not expecting much and boy was I surprised.  I liked it then and I like it now, especially on this nice cleaned up Blu ray version.  The derivative story features a transport ship on its way to New Mecca, some sort of outpost in outer space.  The crew and passengers are all in a condition of induced stasis.  When their ship is penetrated by fragments of a comet or meteor, the crew is awakened as the ship plummets to a nearby planet.  With the captain killed before he could awake, the ship is now the responsibility of the pilot, Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell).  She manages to crash land the craft but not before having to eject most of the passengers in the aft sections of the ship.<br /><br />A handful of survivors includes a group of young Muslims under the guidance of Imam Abu (Keith David), a cop/mercenary known as Johns (Cole Hauser) and his prisoner Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel).  The planet has 3 suns and is constantly in daylight.  It is barren but for the remnants of a mining camp except no humans are there.  Evidence suggest that the camp was wiped out 22 years earlier during a complete solar eclipse.  And guess what it's that time again.  So why is that a problem?  Evidently the only other creatures on the planet only come out when its dark...and they are hungry.<br /><br />Riddick is not a good guy, but there is some sympathy for his character, but I can't put my finger on why.  Diesel does a good job, keeping the guy mean and angry, yet with a small streak of humanity.  Riddick has an unusual physical component to his character.

B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app hasn't stopped or freezed as of yet on my Kindle, even though it does it on my phone. The interface is nice and the same as the mobile app. I'm just hoping this won't start messing up like the mobile does.
B001RTCP1A|4.0|I remember seeing this film for the first time in theaters, not expecting much and boy was I surprised. I liked it then and I like it now, especially on this nice cleaned up Blu ray version. The derivative story features a transport ship on its way to New Mecca, some sort of outpost in outer space. The crew and passengers are all in a condition of induced stasis. When their ship is penetrated by fragments of a comet or meteor, the crew is awakened as the ship plummets to a nearby planet. With the captain killed before he could awake, the ship is now the responsibility of the pilot, Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell). She manages to crash land the craft but not before having to eject most of the passengers in the aft sections of the ship.<br /><br />A handful of survivors includes a group of young Muslims under the guidance of Imam Abu (Keith David), a cop/mercenary known as Johns (Cole Hauser) and his prisoner Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel). The planet has 3 suns and is constantly in daylight. It is barren but for the remnants of a mining camp except no humans are there. Evidence suggest that the camp was wiped out 22 years earlier during a complete solar eclipse. And guess what it's that time again. So why is that a problem? Evidently the only other creatures on the planet only come out when its dark...and they are hungry.<br /><br />Riddick is not a good guy, but there is some sympathy for his character, but I can't put my finger on why. Diesel does a good job, keeping the guy mean and angry, yet with a small streak of humanity. Riddick has an unusual physical component to his character.

B0071MQBX0|5.0|A true honor and a gem. The only omission is Michael Crawford failing to sing due to a virus. But if you listen, his voice can be heard in the final chorus. A royally great production with many fantastic surprises that highlight a magical event.
B0052OSTOS|5.0|This woman's voice is so relaxing, The stress of the day just goes away. Great way to meditate before or after work. Works great before bed time and makes you ready to snooze.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|We loved this series, we did not hear about it until season three was nearly over. We decided to watch an episode each night during the summer reruns on TV. I would highly recommend watching this series.  My husband watched it too!
0307477401|5.0|Read it at the beach this year, it was a great book. A real page turner that really caught the imagination. Turning 61 this year and feeling the effects of aging made this book especially poignant. Highly recommended for everyone.
B0001I55SS|5.0|I'm not sure what to say about \\"The Black Hole\\". As a kid, I felt robbed of a real ending! Or was it the sequel? I read the comics version of the story, in which the space probe emerges unscathed at the other side of the black hole, but the ensuing adventure was never published in Sweden. Was I pissed!!! Yes, this was the kind of stuff that could piss off a ten-year old, or whatever my age was back then. I admit I was just as annoyed as an adult, when I finally saw the film itself on Swedish television - no answers there either, indeed I believe it ended even sooner than the comics version?! Today, I'm cool with this production. Yeah, really.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love drangon story the way where you can bread all different types of drangon s and it is fun visiting people drangon story .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is just like a real horse. I love this game so much.<br />My horse is awesome. Thanks For this game
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|So much fun. I can't wait till all my coins regenerate. I love the added prizes and puzzles that you have to collect as well.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|It was adventurous.  All around good movie. Color was awesome.  Gotta love those super heros. I hated the ending. Need to make a second one to pick up where they left off.
B00008WT5M|1.0|It's not your standard jewel case. It's a cardboard pressed label with a glued on Cd holder inside. Just putting the &#34;CD&#34; case in and out of my CD shelves is scratching the outer pictures up. Horrible quality. Won't buy from here again.
B0031TZAHU|5.0|I just could not put this book down.  Very well writen.  I recommend this book to all of my friends and everyone has good reviews for it.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Excellent graphics and the story is beautiful! We loved this movie and will be one we watch over and over.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This a great seek and search app. Objects are realistic and hints help if you are stuck. It took a minute to figure out that you have to visit the detective agency before being able to start but once you have<br /><br /> that it moves along well
B0091REZMW|4.0|I have been playing this game for a few days now and like other reviewers said, it is addicting and fun. I chose this game because it seemed similar to games I played on facebook and play on pogo. One of the first things I don't like about this game is that it takes an incredibly long time to load and sometimes I have to back out and reload again before it works. I have a problem when I quit the game as well-it doesn't completely quit. The visual part of the game goes away, but the music will keep playing long after I've quit. It will even keep playing when I've closed the case on my kindle, which normally hibernates the kindle, but with this the music keeps playing! One of the ways I have found to get it to stop is to load a different game. One other problems I've encountered with this game is that sometimes I can't get into a room even with repeated touching on the screen. In those cases I have to close the game and reload it. I also wish there was a little more instruction on how to play different parts of the game. You're kind of left to figure it out after the initial tutorial. I don't like the fact that you have to friend request on this game, but at least it isn't like facebook in that your constantly bombarded by people asking for things (at least I don't think it does because I haven't yet, lol). That is one of the main reasons I quit playing games on facebook. The other reason I quit games on facebook is because it kept asking me to spend money. I won't do that, and according to another reviewer I can keep playing as long as I'm patient and wait for energy to build up. That's fine with me. Other than the glitches, uncertainty about some of the gameplay and the money/friend thing this game really is fun. I would be willing to spend a few bucks on it if there were a version that didn't involve friends and additional funding.
B00503BN1M|5.0|It's a good movie for blah days. I was home alone and in the mood for a chick flick, this movie served well.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|For the most part this game works fine on my kindle HD, but it occasionally have its days where I run into issues for example it won't load or in game errors happen. Besides the few hiccups this is a fun and exciting game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so much fun! It is like owning your own house but without all the hassle! I love playing it just as much as my child does, maybe even more than them! I would recommend this game to anyone!
B00A285OOW|4.0|The White Princess held me captivated like all the other Philippa Gregory books, and I read it in conjunction with the start of the Starz series, The White Queen. I have to say I was disappointed when the book ended at only 86% of the download and the remaining portion was a Q&A about the history behind the story. That said, I would STILL have bought the book regardless, but I a notation in the book description should have been given as a head up to the reader per the shortened nature of the download.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun game.  I like to pet the horse.  I wish you didn't ha e to wait for stuff.
0393327655|5.0|At the very least, it will change your mind about the world.If you are a moderate or liberal christian or an atheist or apatheist you'll see why tolerance is not an option. Faith and the future of mankind are at odds and this book demonstrates the case in such an engaging way that you will find it hard to take a break from reading it.
B00004ZBXH|1.0|Yikes, I cannot even watch this!  I ordered it, and it arrived from England..... and it won't play because I'm in the &#34;wrong region.&#34;  What?  Never heard of that before!!!!!!!!
B006S01GH2|5.0|Saw this over 10 years ago and fell in love with Amelie. Still one of my faves!! Highly recommend this movie!

B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Excellent book :) Brings me back to my childhood when I read it, great read.Thoroughly enjoyable, would def recommend to anyone
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I love it so much even when i watch with my nephews we are always laughing. I wouldve given it 20 stars even more if i could.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Great book, fantastic writer. Great to have on the kindle, despite the fact that I prefer to have a hard copy off a book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|my brothers love it so do I and play it 24/7 and the best thing about it is its free! too really should buy this app
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Haven't finished the book yet. So far so good. Really want to see the movie but I'm holding out until I finish this first
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I absolutely love mahjong artifacts, as well as all types of mahjong.<br />It's very challenging,fun, and addictive.<br />Just needs to have different tile sets.
B00EP2PXCY|5.0|Ariana could sing anything and it would impress me, but she's made a high quality album. Even though I already got a leaked version, I'm buying this because I want to support her so that I can hear more from this adorable, talented girl in the future!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Awesome book! I wept, I jumped up and down, it was so erotic.<br />Why is there only 1 more book in this trilogy!?!?<br />I want more.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it every day for sales training notes; travel logs; reminders; etc.<br />Absolutely a must have for my laptop/tablet &amp; phone.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|Loved the movie. Not sure what took me so long to watch it. I would highly recommend it to everyone.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My Kindle would not recharge with the charger sent with the product.<br />Combined with the Power Fast Charger...works very well and charges within a few minutes.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Have read the books  and now watching the  Series on DVD  , this was a good price and is well worth watching .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves this app, so does her mom ;) She loves horses and this cures her need to have one for a while anyhow.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I Love the show and the fact that it can be watched directly on my Xbox! So easy and convenient!
1878424319|5.0|It was a great read, now I just have to apply what I have learned to everyday life. I would recommend this book to others.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I loved this movie as it is Part 1 of Part 2 which I love all the Harry Potter movies and listen to all the music CD's.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|While I liked the movie the story line seemed rather strange. A group of 24 teenagers are are drafted by the central government to put on a show - they must fight to the death. I guess they are paying back the state for the wrongs their ancestors are supposed to have committed. They all go along calmly without any protest except one young girl whose older sister volunteers to take her place. The story revolves around her and the other young man from her district. The government makes a huge pageant of the yearly event putting on parades and banquets. There are qualifying events to build popularity for the combatants in the hope of getting sponsors to send needed supplies from time to time. The fighting is supposed to continue until all but one is left alive and declared the winner. Alliances are formed, though temporary as there can be only one winner. I might watch it again but not soon. 8/6/13 JG
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I loved this movie and view it often. I also love all the other Harry Potter films and the music CD's.
B00B9366VO|3.0|I remember the songs, but didn't care about their backgrounds<br />of drug use, etc...oh well, it was what is was...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Well written. But, oh so sad. The depth of the characters and the playful writing style was what really got me. Probably the best book I've read in months.
B0084670FU|2.0|Third world accounting while the parents are away,<br />the illegal alien who watches the kids gets in trouble, deported,<br />and the only good thing about the movie is it ended well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|You are going to love this game! It has so much stuff you can do with your horse. It totally rocks.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This is by far the best app that I have used to download my favorite YouTube videos thank you app creator keep up the good work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Wow. I have read every single John green book (including let it snow) and I was once again blown away. This book was well written and each character was described to the point where you felt like you know them personally. This book teaches you so much and is wonderful. I would recommend this book to people of all ages. From age eleven and up all the way to ninety years old. Everyone benefits from a book like this. I cried and I laughed. One of my definite favorites.
B0088P2A7A|4.0|I refer to desktop Wiki several times per day, can't imagine I got the app so late. It is almost as good as a desktop except its display screen arrangement seems to be adapted to the Kindle Fire size, so I need to click on chapters to unfold them instead of just scrolling down as on a desktop.
B00563K3DA|5.0|This book is so enlightening and really opens your eyes to what is truly important in life. Enjoy every bit of it  we all deserve happiness
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Had alot of fun. Cant wait for the next one.  The one thing i didn't like was it should have had a hint box or button.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My opinion is that this app has cool animation settings and I look  how you can play online on Facebook
B009WUBERW|4.0|Lots of action with a few laughs.  What's not to love with Sly, Arnold, Jason, and gang.  Terry Crews is great.  Bang em up Terry!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I very much loved how realistic this was. Not a happy ending,but a loving, appreciative one. I highly recommend this book
B00AG297GK|5.0|Although I can't say I ever sat through a whole &#34;Bruno&#34; I really really enjoyed the Dictator.  Laugh out loud sort of stuff.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Excellent! So many twists and turns, I couldn't put this book down!! I need to check out more by this author.
B009ME47H2|5.0|I needed a quick and easy recorder to be able to pass a digital message over the Internet.  This was a quick and easy solution to the problem.  Works well, but very basic.  Hey, remember it is FREE!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|SO COOL GET THIS FREE APP:-)OMG SO COOL DESPICABLE ME TEMPLE RUN GET IT IF U LOVE TEMPLE RUN! !!!!!!!!!!!!<br />:-)
B008469DGY|5.0|Love the game. I like that I can control the ball. It is very challenging with wind actually effecting the flight of the ball
0316044695|5.0|I am humbled to compare anything I've ever done in life with the dedication and heroism exhibited by Marcus Luttrell and his team of heroes.
B00BWWS81S|4.0|Taking a page from Nora jones, it's back to basics for KT, but once you get into her mellow groove, this is a lovely, melodic album.
B00DNLXDUW|1.0|The text looks foreign and it wont let me log in. This app is defective.[[ASIN:B00DNLXDUW Gmail Client For Kindle Fire]] I'm glad it was only 99¢.
B0091VTISO|3.0|Not a bad picture, but the first was better. Needed more barberian mentality. too much CGI, lets get back to acting and more real human possible actions. Real bodys don't get sliced ten inches and not bleed out with no care.
B005PK553C|3.0|But the stories got a bit weaker for me as they went. Too much supernatural stuff is a turn-off for me and I was disappointed when the series went in that direction.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|that has alot of action. the acting was ok, it had an interesting story, but will never win an oscar! i will watch it again!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Setup was a little difficult but once I got through it, it has worked great.<br /><br />My major issue is that it doesn't support enough playback options. On my iPad/iPhone, only Netflix and YouTube (through the YouTube app) are supported. On the computer, I can send anything from Chrome to my tv except, if the site uses Microsoft's Silverlight, it won't send sound. It's pretty annoying to watch the picture on the tv with the sound coming from my computer.
0345529057|5.0|Can't beat the price. And now I can get my fix till Season 4. Everything was intact when it came too.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|First and LAST of this author's books, for me.  I was fairly warned when one critic called her a worthy successor to Maeve Binchy (gagging.)  Not a compliment, though I guess the critic intended it to be.<br /><br />Dull, predictable, plodding, confusing, and in the end, depressing, a downer, a bummer... I cannot think of enough downer words for the \\"resolution,\\" and the use of THAT word is a stretch.  I wish I could remember WHO thought I should read this... Oh!  SNAP!  It was on the NYT best seller list!  Which just goes to show, THAT should not be my barometer...<br /><br />Ugh.  Save your money!  I am SO thankful I got this at my public library.  I feel that, in all fairness, I should put a warning label inside of it before I return it though.  (No, I would never deface public property!)
B00BP4VWRU|5.0|I wasn't familiar with Sally Hawkins before I saw her last week in Woody Allen's new film \\"Blue Jasmine\\" (in my opinion she stole the show). I was so impressed with her in \\"Blue Jasmine\\" that I rented \\"Happy Go Lucky\\" and absolutely fell in love with Poppy. I smiled though out the entire movie (except for violent scene towards the end). Poppy is so bubbly, so full of life and energy, and she's so damn cute you can't help but love her. She finds the humor in life despite being surrounded by serious, grumpy, angry people (roommate, sister, driving instructor, student). I've watched this movie three times and each time it makes me feel so good. I highly recommend it.
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|I don't know about calling something like this entertainment, but I did enjoy it.  It was only slightly slow in places, but it still didn't prevent me from continuing to watch it.  As far as what is absolute truth and what is thrown in drama, I certainly don't know.  Either way, this was a compelling watch and exciting at the same time.  Although I certainly didn't know that it was a woman CIA agent behind the scenes who had orchestrated the whole attack on Bin Laden.  The press only featured the actual soldier that caught him.  Naturally the President said he caught Bin Laden, but obviously it wasn't him that did.  It was this actual soldier and this woman behind the scenes who went on a decade long hunt for him.<br /><br />Spoiler alert if you haven't seen this:<br /><br />The Camp Chapman attack.  The way its depicted in the movie has this CIA agent letting someone who is a threat into the facilities in hopes of interviewing him.  She can't understand why the guards are at the gate stopping him and she asks them to allow him access.  If this really did happen, I find it hard to believe that a supposedly intelligent CIA agent would allow someone who is affiliated with the Al Qaeda into the facility.  Anyone with any measure of intelligence I assumed knew that these terrorists and Al Qaeda connections will sacrifice their own lives just to murder you.  What on Earth propelled her to drop her guard?  The answer to this question is not revealed in the film for some reason.  Regardless, this was worth watching.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|So much fun to share with kids of all ages.  Gets the whole gang working together to find a solution .
B000002I2I|5.0|As good as it gets. Sound quality is excellent. The band is tight and Morrison's at the top of his vocal and lyrical game! Audiophile delight.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|This is a very good book.  It was a little complicated at first dealing with all the different charcters.  But once it got rolling it kept you involved.  I enloyed it very much.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I liked this book this is one of my favorite styles of writing. I did wish that Maria's father had been alerted to Gerard and Norman though! I will try and follow the series.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|I had my doubts before watching this movie.<br />I gave it a chance and I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />It's a really fun and entertaining movie. With great songs and a great storyline.<br />Give it a try!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I finished this book in an hour and a half of intense, focused reading. It's perfect. I loved it. I wish I could read it again for the first time. Gaiman DELIVERS!!
B008GJVH7M|3.0|The service provide was great with ease, the movie was older than I thought.  It was neat to watch had that special touch if 5o's era inside a mind of creative middle man trustee among affiliations.  If you are fascinated with Crime organization from the 50's give this movie an opportunity to watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is one the most fun games I have ever played. I love trying to unlock new characters. Especially I love ones from the new countrys.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|Entertaining and fun movie for the family to watch. Beautiful Creatures is worth renting. My family did really like it .
B005OT2YVA|4.0|Parents, watch this (all three episodes) with your children.  There is more to this genre than car chases, explosions, hot cars, pretty girls, and a young man coming of age.<br /><br />The Transformers - Prime, Bumble Bee, etc., embody the moral conscience of the society your children will hopefully grow up in.<br /><br />Comic books, especially Marvel, are good at taking the simple truth that good MUST triumph over evil... and the reasons why.<br /><br />Talk with your kids about it.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This book should be required reading for everyone, or at least for the majority of modern Americans. This book gives insight into the plight of the poor and the convict, insights which are as poignant today as they were one hundred years ago.
B000NGTJTY|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  It was action packed and good acting.  My only complaint is the profane language used.  I don't know why Hollywood thinks that a movie has to be full of profanity for people to like it.  Maybe it appeals to some but there are many, many high quality movies that do not have all the profanity.  This had a lot of the &#34;F&#34; word which takes away from the movie and it was unnecessary.  Once you get past that, it is a good story line. Maybe I am just old fashion
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|It's ok I like minecraft more but you know it's pretty good for a game like minecraft<br /><br />Any way just go by your self minecraft it's way better
B008BQ8YHQ|2.0|First season was much better. Too much back stabbing, drama. Harvey acting like it was his way is or the highway. Back and forth with Rachael and Mike. Pass on the Third season.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|Striped and soild balls are at their best in this pool game for all ages. It's easy to control once you get into it. This game operates very much like the computer version only differing in the fact you use fingers to play pool rather than a mouse/trackpad. The graphics are great and its a bonus that you can play from your miniclip account and earn stats while mobile. If you do not have an account, there is an opinion to sign in as guest. You can level up and move onto to harder courses against the masters of the game. There are even trophies to be won.Purchase this game and I'd say you've potted the lucky eight ball of the day.

B002X1MUXY|4.0|Incesticide is basically a collection of songs that Nirvana did before Bleach.Kurt Cobains vocals on Incesticide are very hard to understand.Some of the songs are just raw sounding recordings that don't really serve the band very well.Im overall satisfied with it,but I was hoping for some genius lyrics,excellent drumming,good guitar and bass playing.It is pretty much Nirvanas first album if you consider a lot of the songs were before Bleach,which was released in 1989.Kurt Cobain was a manically depressed person,and his lyrics are pretty much about his life.I do find Incesticide to be pretty catchy.Silver is the best song on Incesticide.Insesticide is basically a punk album.No other Nirvana album is as punkish as Incesticide.I will rate all the songs on Insecticide right here.1-Dive-4 stars,Dive is basically just a song that really doesn't make a lot of sense,but its very fun and catchy.2-Silver-5 stars,Silver seems to be about Kurt Cobains childhood.The song is basically about a kid who wants to leave his grandparents house,from what I can tell.3-Stain-4 stars,Stain is a song about a guy that always messes everything up in his life,and basically,he is a Stain to society.A stain is something that leaves a mark on something.In this case,a stain would be like a scar on society.Been A Son-3 stars,Been A Son is a song that seems to be about a girl who isn't accepted by her parents,simply because she wasn't the son her parents wanted.5-Turn Around-3.5 stars,its basically just a catchy song that doesn't mean a whole lot.I see why this wasn't released on prior Nirvana albums,because it lacks creativity and good and clear vocals.6-Mollys Lips-4 stars,Im giving Mollys Lips 4 stars,because it is catchy and the lyrics are very simple and make some sense.Its basically a song about a guy who has a girlfriend who just wants him and doesn't care what she does with him or where she takes him.The rest of the songs on Insesticide are just 2 or 3 stars,because they aren't very well played by the band,and the lyrics get very cheesy and bland.Its a good buy for a big Nirvana fan,but I don't really recommend it to someone new to Nirvana.I would recommend buying Nevermind if you are new to Nirvana.I hope my review was somewhat helpful.I took about 30 minutes to write this review,so please respect my opinion of Insesticide.yed by the band,and the lyrics get very cheesy and bland.Its a good buy for a big Nirvana fan,but I don't really recommend it to someone new to Nirvana.I would recommend buying Nevermind if you are new to Nirvana.I hope my review was somewhat helpful.I took about 30 minutes to write this review,so please respect my opinion of Insesticide.

B00CSYR432|5.0|Ghibli Studio has done it again with a top notch film.  Good graphics, story and good voice talent.  I was happy to hear about this release and being dubbed in English earlier than most.  This is a film for everyone.
B009R659L8|4.0|COMPARED TO OTHER BOOKS WRITTEN BY THE SAME AUTHOR I FELT IT DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER ONES I READ BUT STILL GOOD
B00E978FGQ|1.0|There should be criminal charges against the producers of this movie for the precious millions they wasted. For that matter the cast should receive citations for involving themselves in such a sham. There is zero chemistry between any of the miscast stars and you can read their thoughts as they deliver their lines. They're thinking why oh why did I ever take this job?
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|This is a good read and you definitely want to read all of the series. Lots of action, intrigue, story twists and gallant actions by more than just the heroine. Has some sad spots too because you hate to see some of the characters get killed off that you just started to like.
B008469DGY|5.0|When I first played it, I thought this was just another flick it away and hope for the best...I was unimpressed.<br /><br />Somehow I missed the tutorial. I COULD CONTROL THE BALL IN THE AIR! Who would've thought? Upon discovering this handy tidbit of helpful game-play, it soon became my most played game-app.<br /><br />The excitement comes when I'm about to miss and I start spinning the ball like crazy to make that shot. So far I've only had one perfect shot...swish...I was jumping. The levels just get harder and harder, but with each close shot there is additional seconds added to get off at least one more hasty shot. Is it possible to shoot them balls non-stop? IDK ... but I'm still trying.<br /><br />Thank you developer (Full Fat) for Flick Golf
B0038W0OHQ|3.0|There not bad and there not the Best. I figured because they cost more they would be really good. I do like how well they fit on my head though. there not loose. They fit snug around my ears, That part is cool.<br />But beware they are plastic everywhere. If you have a big head be warned. hey don't like bending open to well and might crack if opened to fare.<br />The speakers are decent. I have heard better but these aint bad. They sound better when your gaming anyways. I tried music and movies on them, Its not as great as playing games on them for some reason. When listening to music, it doesn't seem to utilize enough bass, unless i go into the equalizer setting on m PC and make it higher, but them it kinda starts sounding worse.<br />The mic is cool though how you ca move it inside and out of the ear cup. but the only down side is. its so sensitive that what ever im doing on them the noise that's being made on the speakers vibrates through to the mic, and everyone on say Skype i'm talking to can hear what i'm listening to. So now im using a stand alone mic to get ride of that problem.<br />I do like the two piece cord it comes with. If you plug into just the keyboard it lets you use like 4 feet of cord or so, but if you need to run it through to the back, then it gives you a longer cord which you just attach the end of the other one.<br /><br />Overall there not terrible headphones. I like how they look, but i have owned better ones in the past. But by just changing how i use the mic made these a lot more enjoyable to use honestly.<br /><br />But for anyone to get there own opinion on them they will have to try them for themselves. Everyone has a different opinion and nothing should be based on one guys opinion of something.<br /><br />But this is just how i feel of them.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.
B008469DGY|2.0|Game play is simple, You are given 9 shots and the closer you get to the hole, The more points you get. And you progress through your shots, It moves you further and further away. Not bad but games are over very quick, Takes only 3-4 minutes to complete. No replay value once you have unlocked the other courses and once again, There aren't many courses in the first place so completing the game won't take long.<br /><br />It's a solid game to waste time on but no way would I pay for it nor recommend anyone to buy it. It's just not worth it.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I never leave reviews, I read a ton of books and I read all the reviews but I've never felt the need to leave a review. I loved this book, absolutely loved. Great story, great characters! I will definitely check out all the other books Emma has to offer. Most books now days have a 50 shades look alike book, this romance was a good change! Well worth the price and time to read!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is fun for me and my little brother. Thats why 4 stars but there are spme glicthes when connected to the internet but other then that it is a really fun game!!!!

B00CZAYNOC|5.0|While every song is not a smash hit When you can buy a CD today and 50% of it really kicks at least you really feel you got your moneys worth. Then there are the CDs where there is only 1 song worth listening to on the whole thing....These guys are doing a great job.
B001D09OAI|5.0|Very funny and I have watched it many times. Harry Doyle never gets old. May watch it again very soon.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|it was exciting, though I fell asleep during the middle of it.Make sure you are not sleepy when you watch it.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|Witty, suspenseful and mysterious, really great read, can't wait for the third book, &#34;Lamora&#34; is a quick and extremely worthwhile novel
B005544TRQ|5.0|Given its unlikely premise, it's amazing the degree to which the writing draws you in and takes you on perilous twists and turns that keep you clamoring for more. You care about the well-developed characters--their quirks, idiosyncrasies and vulnerabilities emerge as everyone seeks to cloak them under a veneer of swagger, confidence, and invincibility.  The casting is off the beaten path--where else, for example, would you see a black female managing partner who rocks?
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|.Addicting game. Easy to play. Just the gas and the brake. Simple yet gives a good challenge. Fun to play
B007L5LD9O|3.0|The scenery was very well done.  The story line was a little long for my taste.  I enjoyed it but would not necessarily recommend it to others.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Anything Van does is great and this is no exception.This is more bluesy which I love.Born To Sing is one of greatest works.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|If you want the opportunity to learn about life in North Korea I would highly recommend this book. It is a disturbing read, but well written and informative.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This game used to be fun until they made it so you can't trade certain items, made so it's harder to get certain shadows, and jacked up all the prices of the new rooms to play 1 card can take almost half your daily credits. :-/ got greedy...
B0093LFXIG|5.0|I really liked that you get to know so much about the boys that I didn't knew before. They really opened up to all the readers.
B005LAIHRC|4.0|Great cast & lots of great music and laughs. Julianne has a good voice. Need to see it next on Broadway.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved every aspects of this book! It was so captivative that it was so hard to put it down once you start reading it.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|Good game to pass the time. Levels are progressively more challenging. A good way for kids to practice adaptive problem solving skills.
0385349831|5.0|Paulo Coelho is a must read for every age! I read his book the alchemist when I was 17 and got hooked! He is amazing! Highly recommend!
B0072NWJRK|4.0|The backdrop of historical changes in China, and the reality of a young woman's murder, make the guessed at conclusions of this author both fascinating and plausible.  A fascinating read.
158270208X|4.0|It was a gift to my sister. It looks great, smooth cover and ancient look. I hope she makes good use of it~
B0096HIEE2|3.0|I am not permitted to say things like \\"this movie is based on my life\\" because technically, I have no proof of that. Furthermore, there are enough fabricated plot elements that differ from the true story, that the producers of this movie were able to convince a judge to throw my case out of court.  As an aside, here's a shout out to my attorney Mr Leibowitz, if you are reading this I just want to say \\"You suck and I want my 5 grand back.\\"<br /><br />Let's just run through a few facts and you can decide for yourself.<br /><br />FACT: I am strikingly handsome and sexy.<br />FACT: Some women find Channing Tatum, the actor who portrayed me, to be attractive.<br />Coincidence? Maybe.<br /><br />FACT: I make my living as a Financial Analyst.<br />FACT: My character in the movie is a Male Stripper by trade.<br />OK, this is one of those contrived plot devices that I mentioned earlier... thrown in by the movie writer to make it less obvious he was cashing in on me without so much as a royalty check heading my way.<br /><br />FACT: Channing Tatum wows in this movie with his athletic, sexy dance moves.<br />FACT: I once unleashed some hot dance moves never before seen by womankind. My Bermuda shorts had briefly ignited during an ill conceived and unrehearsed fart lighting demonstration at a frat party... hence the name Timboliah PantsOnFiyah,<br /><br />So, excuse me if I draw the obvious connection between this movie and my life story. My apologies if I come across as a bit indignant over not being acknowledged in the credits of this movie but I'm giving the movie just 3 stars because I'm still just a little pissed about that.<br /><br />Also, about the movie... you need to ask yourself \\"Why am I reading reviews about \\"Magic Mike?\\"<br />(A) If you answered, \\"Because I am looking for a fantastic movie with a great plot, thought provoking themes and top notch acting.\\"  Then this movie will not be for you.  Look elsewhere.<br />(B) If you answered \\"Because I want to rent something that I can watch that will make my female parts feel tingly and make me feel happy because I am looking at handsome guys dancing around without many clothes on.\\"<br />You will thoroughly enjoy this movie.<br /><br />Thank you and have a nice day.ing that I can watch that will make my female parts feel tingly and make me feel happy because I am looking at handsome guys dancing around without many clothes on.\\"<br />You will thoroughly enjoy this movie.<br /><br />Thank you and have a nice day.

B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Splendid piece of cinema, once again from master director, del Toro. A must-watch for anyone with a light heart, seeking a fun ride.
1878424319|5.0|this is a book that will change your life, your thinking and your actions toward other people. If you are open to change and broadminded, this is the book for you.. however, if you are very dogmatic in your beliefs, stay away from this book. it isn't for you.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|The &quot;Share this page&quot; feature does not work on my Fire HD. It is only a minor fault. It would be nice to be able to copy some definitions to Evernote. Perhaps in a later upgrade? Regardless, it's still the best. I upgraded to the Pro, not because I needed it but merely because I wanted to support the product.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Thought this book was great. I loved the intertwining stories. Each different but very familiar. Makes for a much quicker second half of the story. A real page turner!
0345522478|5.0|That's really all I have to say right now! I'm working on a lot of projects, yet I wanted to take time out to say I really appreciated the storytelling in Hounded. I read it about two weeks ago, and I'm now through the whole series. I've recommended the series to several people, and I'll look forward to the next, unhurried, submission/publication. Thanks!
B008I34YYY|5.0|It's a great picture and one rare movie special a theme that's diferent from the big studios and you can watch other taste of movies and other vision from not the big names directors, actors, productions.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Even better than the first book. Very fast paced, I couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read the next book!
B008VO3PA4|5.0|For any cat person (we don't own 'em you know, just the opposite. We get to open the doors, close the doors, put out the food, and clean the litter boxes though. Anyway. A truly delightful book is &#34;I Could Pee on This: And Other Poems by Cats. Short, funny, and on target. The accompanying photos are a nice touch too. I highly recommend this book.
B000001EKX|5.0|This album in my opinion, is the best album Kiss ever made! It is heavy from start to finish-especially my all time favorite Kiss song: Strange Ways, this song is HEAVY and shows how truly talented The Real Spaceman is! I firmly believe Kiss was at their very best before Destoyer and Hotter Than Hell is their greatest masterpiece.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|I love this show.  Season 6 was a little tougher with some character changes, but still great.  I am so glad that I have started watching!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A different game.  I enjoyed searching but sometimes you have no idea what you are looking for and what to do next.  I still enjoyed it!  Made it up to level 10, so far.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I would have liked to see all the episodes (season 1-3)<br />I look at it as what we can or have already experienced in our life.<br />Weather you are of the elite or the servants...this reflects life.<br />Enjoying the  film and not needing to experience their life purpose.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|getting sick of waiting over a year for an update! come on this app was $5!!! besides that its a great game!
B001NLL93W|5.0|I love this book. Can't put it down and can't wait to start on the next book.  Cassandra Clare writes awesome books. Keep it up Cassandra.
B009NLC1D6|5.0|This movie is a must see.  I have to say, it took my emotions and ideals in several directions. In one minute I could see through Gandi's eyes how he gave all he had and suffered for the Love of the Lord and peace on earth.  I'll watch this one again.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Interesting songs, some songs have more or less synth accompaniment but very good album - as someone else stated; &#34;there are no filler songs, they are all good&#34; - if you like one song on this album, you will like them all.
B007N8RULO|3.0|Cards are blurry.  Cards are automatically sent to wrong rows.  Win ratio is low due to cards seemingly unshuffled and like cards are all together.......ie queens with queens, fours with fours, etc.
B0002TJGQS|3.0|Have used three of the 5 pack.  One battery worked as expected, two not so much (all were used in garage door openers).  Excellent price and fast service still makes it worth the chance in my opinion.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The ending definitely pulled me in; but it was so depressing. This book is definitely for people who can take somewhat unhappy endings
B006LSZECO|5.0|What writing ! I have read her other two books... Her twists and turns keep you hooked! Well written and well done! Can not wait for more work!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome it has great quality and makes u not want to stop playing it's a real joy play it
B002RI9PKO|4.0|I liked about the book that it makes clear that great success stories involve a lot of factors and people, that one may overcome (or be blocked) their cultural and family barriers. A book for a self-improvement process that not everyone is ever ready to start.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun. I keep Waiting for the game to ask for money to continue but it hasn't.!!<br />That's a good thing!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I SAW THIS MOVIE AND I REALLY ENJOYED IT.FINALY SOMTHING THAT WAS WRITTEN WELL.I HOPE THEY MAKE A SEQUIL.I WOULD GO TO THE MOVIES TO SEE IT.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Love this movie!!!!  I'm waiting for other seasons.  Now I want to watch the seasons of teen wolf.  Love it!!
B008469DGY|2.0|Graphics are nice.  But just got a little boring after a while.  Children would enjoy this game. Its not bad.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I have read all of the books so far and this one is th best......can't wait until the next one comes out. Nice job Jeff Kinney
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|It's a really good mix of action and story line. Thor is awesome. Video quality is great. Really good movie.
B004GYY714|5.0|There are lots of channels, which is required.  There is much better music than you get on Pandora.  And it syncs nicely across devices.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Not sure what all the hype was about. Felt very formulatic and there were no surprises especially when you knew Gillian was trying to pull one off. I also hate when the author feels like it's necessary to explain the storyline. That means to me they didn't do a good enough job leading you to understand what's happening by their story telling. Save your money and pick it up at the library if you want to judge for yourself.
1427206015|5.0|A good reader can make or break an audiobook. Lorelei King does a wonderful job here. Janet Evanovich always writes an entertaining yarn, but this Stephanie Plum adventure benefits from this audio production. Recommended.
B005HNMPBM|3.0|If you liked the first X-men movie, you might like this one, too. It gives you some of the history behind the first one. Unfortunately, the movie just didn't have me riveted to the edge of my seat like the first one. Watch this one if you want to learn more of the history behind the first movie.
B001RMYWG8|5.0|A great reminder of the benefits of transparency in public systems.  Great cinema in more subtle times, less cgi and more story
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I played Magic years ago, and decided to get back into it recently. I got this game to see how things have changed and was pleased that I still understood the basics. The new features are explained pretty well, so I had no trouble getting back into the game. The interface takes a little getting used to but it's easy once you get the hang of it.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Back to a time when personal integrity meant something.  Aligned with values of commitment to community and family.  Just the right touch of drama and life events that make you smile and ponder.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this series.  And I like the strong female lead characters as well
B00881VLCE|5.0|If you like jigsaw puzzles, this one is for you. Large selection in the initial package, plus more add-in packages both free and for $. You can set your level of expertise, save your puzzles, show only the borders, and other helpful functions.<br />Best of all you can play on your Kindle anywhere.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Awesome and challenging.  Love the layout and the challenge of keeping it energy up!  Great game - cannot wait for more!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this addicting game. I play it a lot.  I always try for a perfect score. Some grids are really tricky, which makes it all the more challenging. Great app
B005DJREGQ|1.0|As if our teenagers today don't have enough on their plates, this series is overblown in the characterization of what is supposedly normal in the schools these days, sex, drugs, and everything goes.  With parents being portrayed as cruel and childish, demonstrating those that think of their kids as mistakes.  This is nowhere close to reality and quite frankly is a very poor example to set for our kids.  No wonder suicide, teen pregnancies, drug addiction, and violence, among kids... is at an all time high in these precarious times.  Shows like this one, only support and condone the problems that kids face every day.  Instead of any positive reinforcement that turns the kids in a better direction, than the filth portrayed on this pitifully dishonest show.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Oh dear........I have read the seven offerings and I really do not know why.....<br />To start the author has absolutely no idea of time or distance or the logitics of an army.....although I found this infuriating I stayed with the storyline hoping that thin gs would improve.....mmmmm ....sadly they did not.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this series to an adult audience....simply put it really is very poorly written. It is poorly planned and executed as a novel series. The character development does not happen....instead the principal characters are thrown into scenario after scenario......simply it is assumed that the more monsters faced...or the more long winded battle descriptors thrown up the more gripping the story.<br /><br />This is aimed at middle primary children who have not been spoily by Eddings, Tolkien or Zelazny
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Just needed to zone out by myself without wife the other night so I watched Thor with Amazon Prime on my Roku.  I'm a sci-fi / action /adventure fan so this fit right in for me.  While not up to the level of Star Trek movies I found the movie entertaining and interesting enough for what I was looking for.  Good story line with good graphics.  Acting is fair.  Amazon Prime is awesome.  Roku is awesome.
0544104404|5.0|This book provided valuable insight into  what some of my at-risks students face and why their coping mechanisms are tenuous at best. I have to admit that at first I was skeptical about this book because of the author's disclaimer that he dropped out of college. I read the preface first (introductory chapter I think  Paul Tough calls it) thinking that I would not proceed if it was not genuine. Consequently, and although reluctantly, I began reading it. I found myself taking copious annotated notes.  It was not only informative  but intriguing.  I have applied some of the methods used in  the studies in my classroom. For instance, the section on goals, obstacles and setting a rule for yourself, I had my students write goals, obstacles, and a rule to overcome the obstacle -- one personal, social, and academic and revisit it monthly. This is a book I will reread. I discovered a gem that is genuinely helpful in widening my perspective on what my students experience. As a parent myself, I thought back to things I did with my sons and it was also a validation in most respects. All my sons have graduated college and are pursuing their passions. I would like to say they have character. I think having read I am better able to relate to the parents of my students (not to judge them or be pedantic) as well as my students (not to enable them but to keep trying to challenge/push them and never giving up on them or myself in trying).
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great book.  Have already read it twice.  The second time I read it in conjunction with the previous one, e.g. read halfway thru &#34;Feast for Crows&#34;, then halfway thru &#34;A Dance with Dragon&#34;, then completed &#34;Crows&#34;, then &#34;Dragons&#34;.  Found out stuff that I missed and enjoyed the whole process - so much so that I've already been thru the series waiting for the next book to be published.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Using a deceptively breezy style, the author considers the morality of keeping secrets versus the damages incurred in revealing them.  The book looks at the role that forgiveness plays in our lives and how the person doing the forgiving actually benefits more than the person being forgiven.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE SUBWAY SURFERS IT IS REALLY FUN TO PLAY WITH ON KINDLE AND I DON'T CARE IF THEY CHANGE THE GAME BECAUSE I LOVE SUBWAY SURFERS.

B005K17RU0|5.0|Really like this app. Tells me more about the weather here in my town. Shows me the different kinds of weather maps across the states. More accurate temps through out the day till midnight. Do not regret down loading this accu weather app. Weather bug was good but would mess up and would have to download the app. Suppose to be for kindle fire Hd. Didn't work right. This app so far I have no problems. I would recommend any one to download this and try it out. Great App !

B007N5YIUS|5.0|Can't get enough angry birds .Have the original, Rio, and now the space. Great apps even for the adults to play. Only issue with this app ( angry birds in space ) downloaded the the one not commercial free. But already have points building up so won't change over to commercial free. This was a free app. Recommend the commercial free angry birds in space should be free and not cost 2.99 for it. Either then that I'm trying to deal with the commercial popping up. It is another great app to download and play.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|of course i love MB but this album is just wonderful , i sing along & listen to it over & over
B000YJ54DU|5.0|If you like jack, this one is enjoyable. Like all in this series 'NTL' is typical of action from start to finish. Child is still at the top of his game.
B006PAO2FS|5.0|Glad he finally got around to doing this album. Great collection. Sounds even better on vinyl of course. Love it.
B002GMSMHS|5.0|I couldn't find this in any store so I was excited to see I could get this on Amazon. Just what I was looking for!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|A finely animated version.  Only donwside was the excess of bonus DVD, hwich my daughter found mostly boring, other than the long nosed original Mickey and Minnie at the premiere.
B0070UFMOW|3.0|It is an excellent unit and I would rate 5 stars except that the audio cable that came with the unit was defective and has not been replaced. However the unit works beautifully with the L3 extra and my I-Pod. Without the audio cable I cannot connect the unit to my tablet.
B00E9LL4UG|5.0|The music is AWESOME... and her videos can be watched MULTIPLE times without getting bored. Great job! nuff said... this is just to fill the required field for words...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the series and it is a pleasure to watch on Amazon Video- the streaming is always available and never have any problems viewing.
B00005JLXE|5.0|this is the only hero that i know of that is blind.  the action is great.  Michal Clark Duncan plays kingpin.
034580404X|4.0|It was as I expected. Finished the books in 3 weeks. I honestly could say I could not put it down. I recommend it. I am excited for the movie to come out
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I loved the new BTD game! At first I was worried that the fifth game wasn't going to be good (mostly because of bad experience with sequels before.) but over all I loved the game and the additions they put in my favorite being the special agents. Well that's all from me. If your still reading stop  and get this game already!
B004S6E91S|4.0|The product got to me in a timely manner. The only problem I have is that I didn't pay attention to the region that this item is good for. The company did not have a problem with me sending it back for a full refund but I found out that it would cost me more to send it back then just keeping it. So to all those out there be sure you read carefully before purchasing items and always see if it states a region. Enjoy
B00B9366VO|5.0|Learned a lot about music and how it all happens. It was like a back stage tour to the music industry.
