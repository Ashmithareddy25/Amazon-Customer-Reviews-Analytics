B000646MNE|1.0|What a horrific show. Four messed up, neurotic victims of modern society justifying themselves through bad comedy, and a similar existence for millions of women who sit around feeling miserable about themselves, eating chocolate and gaining solace through false identification with these ridiculous characters. The writers bear no small amount of responsibility for allowing the world's womenfolk to drift further and further down a ghastly path of promiscuous, unstable, self-gratifying misery. Still, credit where credit's due - they have managed to create the four least attractive female characters in TV history - an achievement of sorts, I suppose...
B0001UL7RY|4.0|This CD really changed my mind about Avril. Her first CD was really weird and pretty immature, but this one has lots of really amazing songs that are very deep and emotional.      1. Take Me Away-I don't see why most people hate this song so much. I love it!!! I think it's because I can really relate to it and most people can't. 10/10  2. Together-This song is really catchy, but it's about a broken relationship and I'm not very knowledgeable in that category. 8/10  3. Don't Tell Me-I always found this pretty irritating. It is about a broken relationship which, again, I don't know much about (or any kind of relationship for that matter). 7/10  4. He Wasn't-Really catchy and fun to dance to. The lyrics are pretty weird, though, and the \\"lalas\\" and \\"heys\\" can get really annoying. 8/10  5. How Does It Feel-Avril's voice is beautiful in this song. It's really nice and mellow, but  the lyrics in the chorus are really odd. 9/10  6. My Happy Ending-I used to like it...I think. It got so overplayed and annoying that I had to stop listening to it. Anyway, I was never really fond of the echoes in the chorus. 4/10  7. Nobody's Home-AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME SONG!!!!  THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM!!! IF EVERY SONG HERE SUCKED REALLY HARD, THIS WOULD MAKE UP FOR IT!! AVRIL'S VOICE IS BETTER THAN EVER AND THE LYRICS ARE BEAUTIFUL. IF YOU'RE NOT SURE IF YOU WANT THE CD OR NOT, LISTEN TO THIS SONG AND IT WILL CHANGE YOUR MIND!!!!! 10,000/10  8. Forgotten-One of Avril's darker songs. The piano at the beginning is really spooky and it just keeps getting better. 10/10  9. Who Knows-It's good the first couple of times but after a while it starts to sound really repetitive. You might not like it. 7/10  10. Fall To Pieces-This is a beautiful song, but I don't really like love songs sung by females. But that's just me. You'd probably like it. 7/10  11. Freak Out-It's a great upbeat song that's great to dance to, but Avril's voice sounds like nails on a chalkboard in this song which really surprised me. 7/10  12. Slipped Away-This is a magnificent sad song about her grandpa's death. I really need to give Avril credit for this one because writing about death isn't easy-believe me, I've tried. 10/10
037571412X|4.0|Closer to three-and-a-half stars.  An amazing thing happened to Philip Roth in the 1990s.  While his contemporaries--Updike, Styron and Mailer--were either hibernating or spinning their wheels, Roth was reinventing himself.  His novels of the '80s were concerned primarily with writing--that is, the writer as narrator, and about sex; and though at least one of the novels (\\"The Counterlife\\") was very fine, Roth's books seemed rather narrow in scope.  But beginning with his memoir \\"Patrimony\\" in '91 and continuing on, Roth majorly reinvented his fiction.  His fictional landscapes have expanded.  He has moved outside the \\"writing about writing\\" trap so many highbrow authors fall into, and has written about the world around him.  His prose is as indignant, as over-the-top (sometimes), as funny as ever--but his literary scope is much wider.  Surely this is why his latest novels have gained a wide readership and all of America's major literary awards. <br /> <br />\\"The Dying Animal\\", at first glance, seems a throwback to the Roth of the '80s.  It's a book about sex, no question.  The author is an elderly man with a fondness for young women (who somehow find him irresistible) and a seemingly inexhaustible sexual appetite.  All of it seems recycled (and, given the narrator's age, unbelievable), until one realizes that Roth is treating these themes in a very different way.  The deep sadness that runs through this novel is relatively new to Roth's writing and appears to have originated in his '91 memoir, \\"Patrimony.\\"  I know it's dangerous to make inferences about authors given their written product (Zuckerman taught us that, if nothing else!), but Roth is not a young man anymore and his latest novels, \\"The Dying Animal\\" among them, portray older men coming to grips with their mortality and trying to make sense of the lives they have led and the world around them.  That is what David Kepesh is doing here, though he fights with all his might not to do it.  He wants to continueliving the life of a sexual miscreant, but the mind and body (and, dare one say it? the heart), won't let him.  He's becoming, ever so gradually, the kindly, harmless old man he never wanted to be.  Of course, he resists it vigorously--and this is where Roth's impassioned, angry prose works beautifully--but faced with death and decay everywhere, he knows it's a losing battle. <br /> <br />Coming off the high of his Americana trilogy (and the literary peak of \\"The Human Stain\\"), this book may seem slight in size and scope, and it is.  It may not be one of Roth's very best, but it's very good nonetheless, and every bit worth a read.  It is most definitely NOT a recycling of his old books.  (In fact, a warning is in order:  if you've read \\"The Professor of Desire\\" already, forget everything you knew about David Kepesh, because the character's history has changed markedly in this novel.)
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Seriously! I see about 1,001 reviews for Under My Skin and most of them are about How she Looks and everything well, guess what? She`s a great singer (Unlike Brittany Spears Yuck!) Hilary Duff is good, Ashlee Simpson is OK, so if you do nonthing but complain that she does not bath and how greasy her hair looks. Hello! Its not ALWAYS about the hair,make-up,etc!

B00005JNTX|4.0|A comic book, by whatever name you wish to call it, is low art. But it is a true art form. To take its elements -- such as voice-over; choppy corny dialog; unevenly rendered details; and gritty, realistic, but seemingly arbitrarily arranged compositions -- and apply them to motion pictures, should be a disaster. But SIN CITY really does work. The images are dramatic, the acting intense, the plots thoughtful. The presumed-crude elements lend a throwback sense to the movie, almost as if one is back in the early silent era and the director is experimenting with the medium and struggling and stumbling to get his story told. Yet it's probably mostly state-of-the-art special effects!  <br /> <br />And the DVD looks great on a bigscreen TV! Everything's vivd. The blacks and whites, the few colors, the details, the emotions, the heroism and villainy! Violence, nudity, very adult themes: it's very deserving of the \\"R\\" rating. But for those who can stomach it, it's a must see.

B000063DFN|5.0|Ah, what's to say that hasn't yet been said?  When you look up metal in the dictionary, you'll see Maiden right next to it.  And if you don't, then buy a revised copy.  This is the definitive sound of everything that ever has been and everything that ever will be metal.  Put simply, Maiden are legends, and Powerslave is one of their best efforts.  Incredible riffing, mindblowingly complex drumming, killer solos, and that incredible power surge of Bruce Dickinson - this band has a sense of scale, and that scale is big.  I can't even try to pick individual highlights, but the last song, the epic \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" is pure genius!  Certain parts of that song give me chills like no other.  To wrap this short review up (and I know Maiden deserve a longer one), go out, buy Powerslave, crank up the stereo, and have yourself a good time.  Really, it can't offer anything less.  Not that we'd expect it to anyways. <br /> <br />10/10 <br /> <br />PS - Sharon Osbourne, her stupid daughter, \\"Big Dave\\" and that lame excuse for a band Bury Your Dead can all jump off a bridge for all I care.  No one f**** with Maiden and gets away with it!  Up the Irons, cuz Ozzfest is now dead!
B0006L0LOS|2.0|After all of the promotional hype I expected something more from this movie than a catty meow! But I guess comic book subjects aren't rocket science. I just can't understand why Oscar winner Halle Berry would claw her way to the bottom so soon. <br /> <br />Catwoman (Halle Berry) rises from the spirit of an ancient cat who breathes new life into a lowly ad-woman. By the light of a full moon Catwoman stalks her prey beginning with ancient jewelry, as a \\"cat-burglar\\" and suddenly becoming a crime fighting kitty with heart. Both in and out of costume Catwoman seduces Detective Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) with her feline charms. The bad guys run a cosmetics company that fights the aging but makes one sick in the process. Laurel and George Hedare (Sharon Stone/Lambert Wilson) eventually become Miss Kitty's prey in this predictable tale out of Gotham. <br /> <br />This overly done film is pretty much a music video for pretty little Halle Berry to strut her well developed stiff to. So it will always appeal to the easily pleased young male mindset. However it is a disappointment to see such a wonderful actress fall so low in the ranks after winning a well deserved Oscar (for Monster's Ball). The costumes and prowling scenes are posed for the young video game enthusiast. The action shots are obviously computer generated and the cuts between the two are simply horrible. Bratt and Berry are convincing enough as romantic leads but somehow lose their context within this movie. Sharon Stone is the one standout, playing a more than convincing aging menace to society.....and she looks great doing it. If you are a Gotham fan looking for good Catwoman material try Michelle Pfeiffer in the role in Tim Burton's film \\"Batman Returns\\" (1992), Pfeiffer does a much better job as the playful kitty. Sadly Halle should stick to what she does best DRAMA and leave the meowing to another litter of up and coming starlets without their reputation at stake. <br /> <br />  <br />
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Pretty bad horror thriller that insults the audience more than it entertains with a screenplay that feels like a rough outline of a story instead of an actually screenplay for a movie and some pretty unimpressive special effects and bad performances. I think Keanu Reeves is a pretty good actor but his performance here was less than desirable and he does not come across well at all. I think it's more the fault of the screenplay more than his effort because most of the actors in the film don't come across well at all with the exception of Rachel Weisz, who is not only the strongest actor in the film but the only actor that manages to transcend the horrible script with a gritty and complex performance that is way too mature for a film of this nature. If the movie was as good as her performance, it would have been a great film hands down but with only Rachel Weisz being able do to more with her character and her performance than the movie does with itself as a whole, her performance is the only good thing this movie really has. The rest of the film not only does not know what it wants to do with itself but also does not have a real narrative to steer the film to where it wants and needs to go. You end up more confused with the film's purpose other than to have any solid storytelling to keep you interested in what is going on and that where the major problem lies because you end up in the same place you started when the film ends where you were in the beginning and that's not the way any movie should treat its audience
B00000633N|4.0|The Pet Shop Boys have a habit of releasing 'minor' albums between their major releases. Between their first and second albums, Please and Actually, they released Disco, a six-track piece which featured no real new material, but rather remixes of previously released tracks (some primary, some B-side works).<br /><br />Between Actually and Behaviour, the Pet Shop Boys released this album, Introspective, another minor album, with six tracks. However, this time there was new material--remixes of two previously released pieces, and four new works. This was done in an interesting format--each of the tracks on the album were in the form of 'extended dance versions', usually the kind of thing one gets when purchasing the single apart from the album. However, to get the tradition 'album' version of songs such as Domino dancing, Left to my own devices, or It's alright, one had to purchase the singles. This was an interesting marketing ploy, and extended the sales and life of this small album far beyond what it otherwise would have had.<br /><br />Domino dancing was released first, and a classic Pet Shop Boys sound took over dance floors worldwide, combined with a Latin rhythm which was also in vogue during the fall of 1988. This had also perhaps the last MTV-hit video for the Pet Shop Boys; after this time, the videos released by the Pet Shop Boys no longer fit the game-show-and-rap-video dominated MTV schedule, although their videos continued to be played extensively on Euro-MTV.<br /><br />Left to my own devices features more of the signature obscure-intellectual lyrics that Neil Tennant has been noted for:<br /><br />I was faced by a choice at a difficult age,<br /><br />would I write a book, or should I take to the stage,<br /><br />but in the back of my head, I heard distant feet<br /><br />Che Guevara and Debussy to a disco beat.<br /><br />Simple music tracks backing introspective lyrics (perhaps this is how the album came by its title--Introspective).<br /><br />I'm not scared was actually written for Patsy Kensit and Eighth Wonder (not so much of a wonder, in fact!), and was produced as a single for them by the Pet Shop Boys, before Eighth Wonder decided they did not care for the collaboration. (Take note--where are they today?) The Pet Shop Boys did their own version on this album which, while it was not released as a single, fared rather better than the Eighth Wonder version critically and in radio playtime.<br /><br />It's alright was released immediately prior to their tour in the summer of 1989, actually long past the 'hot' time of the album, but served to show the enduring value of the Pet Shop Boys--that their albums can sit on the shelves for some time and lose none of their luster. Originally written by Chicago-House artist Sterling Void, this song was revitalised, had some new lyrics inserted, and became a hit for the Pet Shop Boys, their last for over a year, until Behaviour and its attendant singles began to be released late in 1990.<br /><br />This is an album really for fans, but it is, like most of their albums, remarkably consistent in the look-and-feel of all songs, high quality and interesting to the ear.ot scared was actually written for Patsy Kensit and Eighth Wonder (not so much of a wonder, in fact!), and was produced as a single for them by the Pet Shop Boys, before Eighth Wonder decided they did not care for the collaboration.

0142404128|4.0|I'll readily admit that I didn't know that \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" was a book until Johnny Depp brought it to my attention, but that when I unearthed it, it was like finding buried treasure. Imagine my surprise while idling in the \\"Independent Reader\\" section of the bookstore, when I happened to come across a sequel to the classic original.<br /><br />The sequel starts us at the point where Charlie and his family are about to move into Willy Wonka's factory (now Charlie's of course), and in usual Wonka style he picks them up, bed and all, in a glass elevator with amazing capabilities.<br /><br />Due to an untimely misunderstanding and disagreement about falling several thousands of feet through a roof, the elevator and its unlikely astronauts are propelled into outer space, and find themselves in a weightless adventure saving the USA's commuter capsule from the clutches of the rampaging Vermicious Knids.<br /><br />This takes up most of the book, but once they are safely returned to Casa Wonka, the elderly family members succumb to the same lack of common sense exhibited by the children of the previous book, and swiftly get themselves into a little trouble by not listening to the Wonka-man's mumblings.<br /><br />Though not as entertaining or imaginative as the first, this one is full of humor and impossible but funny situations, and deserves 3.5 stars for weirdness alone.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, August 23, 2005
B000301YY8|5.0|By far the best album I have bought in years, the songs are beautifully written and James Blunt's voice is incredible. I can't stop listening to it since I first heard You're Beautiful.<BR>Goodbye My Lover stays with you for days... and is the first album I've never been sick of hearing over and over. I can't say the same for my housemates (but see they've all now downloaded it to their ipods)

015670160X|2.0|.....isn't that someplace in Florida? <br /> <br />It would be interesting to see what old VW would have made of that section of the planet had she decided to incorporate it into her novel.  She was, however, a member of a clique which chose to incarcerate itself in the English Cotswolds for the main part.  Ah, wait...I feel an analogy coming on.....nope, it's gone! <br /> <br />There's nothing amazing about 'Orlando' it was a vehicle for Heaven knows what hang-up Woolf was pretending to endure at the time.  No one in that era wrote for entertainment or pleasure, it was always to make some point or other.  Thankfully the 'real' focus of most of these idle rants are lost in the mists of time. <br /> <br />It does, however, contain some cute imagery; the bit where the River Thames suddenly becomes unfrozen is good....I regard the presumed ancestors of Michael Winner hosting the mass banquet condemned to a watery eternity sans iceberg as semi-historic.   <br /> <br />All in all, this tome should be read and sneered at .... like all  such books. <br /> <br />One shouldn't focus on the overall plot but the few mini-gems sparsely scattered throughout the text.
B00005ABX0|5.0|Letting go of the \\"what could have beens\\" with Smile hasn't been easy for many Beach Boys fans- yet it tarnishes a lot of what they did afterwards.  There have been many bands that have had aborted projects- some songs found life in other projects.  In the progression of The Beach Boys circa 1966-67 there's Pet Sounds, the \\"Good Vibrations\\" single, Smiley Smile, and then Wild Honey.  There was a time when I might I have thought that Smiley Smile and Wild Honey were steps back artistically; especially when I would put myself to wondering about the aborted Smile project; but in my maturity the steps back artistically have become steps forward humanly.  The proceeding albums had less flair and \\"ambition\\"; the staple became more and more friendly and subtle- especially when you include the wonderful Friends album.<br /><br />The enormous ambition that was so much the core of Brian Wilson's progress had turned into personal flights of fancy.  The remnants of this, Smile, was rerecorded and turned into Smiley Smile.  Parts spooky and haunting, parts comical and silly, the music is complex yet at times astonishingly simple- it was an exorcism and slow return to being the Beach Boys.  One major change that started occurring during the recording of this album is that the Beach Boys started recording the music themselves without the assistance of the Wrecking Crew (a famous group of LA session musicians).<br /><br />Although I have preferred the \\"Smile\\" versions of Wonderful, Vegetables, Wind Chimes they are not without plenty of charm.  She's Going Bald and Little Pad are fun ditties that have some experimental elements.  Although this is a personal estimation I think some of the songs could be very disregarded by the most serious fans such as Fall Breaks Back Into Winter and Getting' Hungry.<br /><br />Within the same year they had switched tracks to a much more earthy less psychedelic sound.  The result is the highly enjoyable Wild Honey.  This is a truly great album by the Beach Boys- this was their back to basics album with a new found interest in R&B.  It was a group effort on many levels- the song writing was very good and the performances had a passion and honesty that I have found on Pet Sounds without the self indulgence.  Songs like Darlin', Wild Honey, Here Comes The Night and Aren't You Glad are on my list of top Beach Boys songs.  The Stevie Wonder cover I Was Made To Love Her is actually a surprisingly good cover; Carl sounds quite soulful.<br /><br />Finally I have to mention Let The Wind Blow- a touching reminder of the power of love- the deepest and most important thing in the world.  The sentiment came during a time when many were writing protest songs about everything that was wrong with the world.  The simplicity of the desire to give and feel love to one special person in his life resonates so strongly in contrast to the protests and criticisms of inhumanity.  The song itself is so simple that it's easy to past right by it but with the feeling of the song hits you it is a sincere plea for more love.<br /><br />The bonus tracks a cool- there is an amazing live recording from another aborted album; Their Hearts Were Full Of Spring is a cover of a Four Freshmen song that harkens back to Brian's youth.  There's also a good version of Can't Wait Too Long once again from the Smile sessions.<br /><br />I highly recommend these albums.  They come as a twofer but both albums are remarkably short; many albums back then clocked in at 40 minutes long because of the time constraints of records-- Wild Honey is only 23 minutes long!)<br /><br />Also check out Sunflower, Friends, Holland, and Dennis Wilson's Pacific Ocean Blues (if you can find it) all top notch albums.truly great album by the Beach Boys- this was their back to basics album with a new found interest in R&B.

B0007M22TI|4.0|I like this, don't get me wrong, but if there could just be more fast stuff, more music from the fiddle player and maybe a bit more focus on the orchestra, It would be perfect. <br /> <br />I wanted to see a solo from the orchestra.......how about an overture or something like that? and maybe the pianist. <br /> <br />There's also nothing that the fiddle player and orchestra play together. <br /> <br />I hope some of these things may be recified for volume 2 if there is one. Like I say, I really enjoy it but some of these omissions annoyed me. I suppose it was quite a big thing to put together. <br /> <br />Also like Sara Brightman, but after about an hour of her DVD I am bored, kinda the same thing over and over. Here it's one different thig  after another, I didn't notice that it was nearly over and I was still watching without even stopping. <br /> <br />But I would watch it more often if there was a little more action between the girls and more of the fiddle player. Sorry I don't know all their names, I can never figure out who is who without watching the opening sequence! <br /> <br />Looking forward to Vol.2........?
B00021R7CG|3.0|Though I'm sure our brave men and women serving in the armed forces, especially during the Cold War 80's, will be able to pick this movie apart, I must say that I enjoyed watching this movie back when it was first released by HBO.  I just got finished watching it again and I still enjoyed it.  It takes a serious look at our stupidity (from a Human-race standpoint) surounding Nuclear War.  It also looks at the mistakes we all make when the pressure is on.  Rebecca DeMornay's character says this best when she confirms to Powers Boothe's character, \\"Did we do anything right today?\\"<br /><br />The acting if grand.  You seldom saw such great performances out of cable movies back in the 80's (save for other early HBO flicks like \\"Long Gone\\" and the like).  Most impressive was the performances of James Earl Jones, Rip Torn and Martin Landou.<br /><br />The script was written well, though there is some essence of \\"cheese\\" here and there, most coming from the cockpit conversations between Boothe and DeMornay.  The President speaking with Soviet Premere over some guys radio at an Olney, MD FEMA hosiptal was also kind of lame.  On last thing about the script: if the writer wanted to give the acting President, the Secretayr of the Interior character, some credibility at all, he could have mentioned that the reason he wanted to attack and destroy the Soviet Union in his \\"two-one-Zebra Grand Tour\\" attack, he could have simply stated that he wanted to make sure this would not happen again, or that he was preventing World War IV.<br /><br />All-in-all, a well rounded movie and enjoyable to watch several times, if viewings are spaced out.  If your DVD collection is small, I'd wait a bit before getting this unless you really enjoy the genre.  But if your like me and love movies, by all means get it.<br /><br />One piece of trivia (for sci-fi buffs):  In the movie, the pilot of Air Force One (Steve Rankin) played by guest character \\"Ray Butts\\" on FOX's sci-fi series \\"Space: Above and Beyond.\\"  The lead character from that series, James Morrison, also had the roll of an Air Force One pilot on the popular series \\"The West Wing.\\"  ...yea, I know.

B000003TA4|5.0|I am tempted to conclude that music review boards are a waste of time (don't worry I see the irony). I mean if you actually used the below reviews as a guideline (and clearly no-one is because its selling quite well) you would probably abstain from buying this album.  <br />So why is it still selling well? Because contrary to what you see below - it's a good rock album. The drumming is solid, the guitars are powerful and work well and the phrasing is good - hence it's popularity.

B00082ZS5W|5.0|If I were to have one complaint about Dido, it would be her studio tracks are a little *too* laid back and they sometimes get monotonous if you're not in the mood for them.  Nevertheless, I love her songwriting and she ranks with up there with Poe as far as lyrical excellence is concerned.  Her lyrics are subtle, sophisticated, and well-crafted.  Here on her live DVD, my one complaint towards her is revoked, removed, and I've re-experienced Dido at her finest.  Her live performance is where the missing spark can be found; her energy comes through blasting and blaring and she takes you for a memorable ride. <br /> <br />As a casual fan, what surprised me was her undeniable charm and charisma.  Along with her energy, these elements of her just don't come through on her studio albums nor in her videos.  She's also got quite a facetious, lively sense of humor (which she shares with the audience between songs).  This makes the music that much more accessible.  I found I didn't need to be 'in the mood' for her music to watch her concert.  Like her music, Dido herself is captivating in a subdued, subtle manner.  The band, the singing were all top-notch and I have no complaints about the music.  Dido, her band, and the audience all looked as if they were having the time of their lives, and it definitely shows.  The music was all terrific, and so good was this concert that it prompted me to re-visit some songs I didn't particularly like and give them a second chance after seeing it live on the DVD.  That's a sure sign a concert was a winner for me. <br /> <br />Fans of Dido will not want to miss banter and conversations that happen in between songs.  She shares (briefly) some information about the song she's going to sing next, which is quite nice.  She never gets too carried away (y'know how some singer-songwriters make less and less sense the more they talk about their song?) and always stays grounded and makes complete sense.  Surprisingly, she's also quite funny!  (And guys, my husband watched this DVD and he assures me she's quite hot, as well.) <br /> <br />Now, on to a very important reason I love this DVD: no. psychotic. editing!  (Yay!  Yay!  Yay!)  After being so very, very, very disappointed with Sheryl Crow's \\"C'mon America\\" and Sarah McLachlan's \\"Afterglow Live,\\" I was afraid Dido's DVD was going to follow the 'nauseatingly choppy and twirly rockstar' trend.  (Note: I love those two ladies and I thought their performances were top-notch.  This isn't an attack on Sheryl or Sarah's performances--I just couldn't stand editing of the video) I've said repeatedly on Amazon that I wish that trend would die because I literally get motion sick watching concerts that do their editing that way (where the camera doesn't linger on any one shot for more than 5 seconds) and those DVDs are absolutely unwatchable.  (I'm 24, so no, it's not an age issue.)  So, if you can sympathize with this, fear not!  Dido has not succumbed and this DVD is more than watchable.  The only complaint I can see is that the video quality isn't crystal clear.  It reminded me a bit of Sarah McLachlan's 'Mirrorball.'  I, however, enjoyed the look of it because it lent a certain atmosphere and feel to the DVD that complemented it very well. <br /> <br />Ever since Sarah McLachlan's 'Mirrorball,' I haven't found a concert DVD that's compelled me to watch and re-watch a concert as often as I did with 'Mirrorball.'  Dido's done it for me, though, and it's quite a pleasure to see her perform.  This is one of the concerts that will get watched often in my house.  I will be anxiously awaiting her next CD, DVD, tour, etc.
B00001ZULV|2.0|First of all, let me start by saying I'm not a big fan of \\"best of\\" or \\"greatest hits\\" compilations.  I do believe they do serve a purpose though.  They can be used to introduce potential fans to what the band has to offer by presenting a balanced mix of music from throughout the band careers.  Or They can be targeted to the casual listener who doesn't want to commit to buying individual albums, and instead focus on getting \\"the best\\" with one purchase.  This compilation accomplishes neither. <br /> <br />It's difficult to make a single disc \\"best of\\" type collection for Genesis. They've been around for almost forty years, and have released an enourmous amount of music that has changed a great deal. This \\"Greatest Hits\\" album attempts to put all the \\"hits\\" on disc. It succeeds to an extent, but misses quite a few, including Taking It All Too Hard, No Reply At All, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, Dance on a Volcano, and Squonk. <br /> <br />It also fails to be a \\"Best of\\" album as it misses their best work, namely Musical Box, Supper's Ready, Firth of Fifth, Dancing with a Moonlit Night, to name a few. <br /> <br />It is also does not represent Genesis very well for the new fan, as the focus is almost entirely on the period between 1978-1993 with only two songs from the earlier Gabriel period, one of them being an inferior remake (although they did get the five of them back together, so for that, this one is almost worth it). <br /> <br />A better beginner's guide to Genesis would have been to attempt to grab one song from each album, hence capturing the essence of the band's evolution. It's a better introduction to the band for those new to Genesis, and a better guide as to what a potential fan should get next. <br /> <br />Something like this could have worked better: <br />The Silent Sun <br />Dusk  <br />The Musical Box  <br />Can Utility and the Coastliners  <br />Firth of Fifth  <br />The Carpet Crawlers  <br />Dance on a Volcano  <br />Blood on the Rooftops  <br />Follow You, Follow Me  <br />Misunderstanding <br />No Reply at All  <br />That's All  <br />Land of Confusion  <br />Never a Time  <br />Shipwrecked  <br /> <br />Yes it would have missed some hits and some of their best songs, but that's simply not possible to achieve on a single disc. The above compilation is doable without editing any tracks, and without going over to a new disc. And the best part is there is a song from each album, from each era of Genesis from 1968-1997. A good balanced and abridged representation of the band's career, and a good beginner's guide to the band. <br /> <br />Of course, if you're only interested in hearing a few of their 80's pop hits and don't mind hearing edited versions and missing a few hits here an there add a couple stars, you will probably like this. <br />
B000001F3C|5.0|I just have to speak out--for myself, I guess.  I agree with what's been written here.  This is the best, most important album of the 80s.  It could be the best rock album ever made. <br /> <br />What really has to be asked is, why?  Why did they give it up--a sound that they were pioneering (not alone, of course; there were others, but they were the best)?  Why give up a uniquely Irish perspective on life and on world-shared issues?  Why give up a sound world that was Irish?   <br /> <br />It's funny.  Van Morrison makes a career from American music, and succeeds.  Elton John had early success in it.  U2 turned away from their own roots to America, and haven't made anything as compelling since WAR!!!  I just don't get it.  <br /> <br />There are artists who lift up their own time and place for all to share--the local becomes the universal; with U2 this was so, 'til they went for the universal and lost much of their core (what made them the best there was).  Now they're just good. The Amazon review at the top states that this album was the last before they broadened their sonic palette; I defy anyone to be as startled by an album's sound (by U2 or any band) as this one. The first sound is a snare and a violin, heralding in an Irish way the otherworldly bombast to come--U2 never topped it. <br />  <br />To anyone who says U2 had to move on to grow, I have two words: Neil Young. There, I said my peace.
B000002J2F|4.0|I'm a big Genesis fan, but prefer the earlier progressive period to the later pop period.  This is later period Genesis, but it is good later period Genesis. <br /> <br />The good stuff is the main Duke suite on which this semi-concept album is based: Behind the Lines - Duchess - Guide Vocal.  It later makes a return on Duke's End - Duke's Travels.  These are heavily instrumental complex progressive tracks reminiscient of their previous albums.  As always, the technical ability of these musicians is top notch, and the lyrics are dark and powerful. <br /> <br />But, around this time, Genesis was trying to reach a broader audience.  They had gotten a taste of mainstream success with their last album's number one hit, Follow You, Follow Me, which had been a pleasant surprise for the band.  Genesis had been a widely respected and popular prog rock band for ten years, but had never enjoyed large scale success until recently.  In an attempt to tap into that broader audience, they wrote more short and catchy songs on this album.  Some are good, some are not so good.  The good ones are Man of Our Times, which is actually more progressive than poppy (which is probably why I like it), but short enough for radio play.  Misunderstanding isn't bad either, and turned out to be the albums biggest hit.  Also, Turn it On Again also had quite a bit of success on the charts, and was a good representation of their sound at that point. <br /> <br />But there are also quite a few sappy love ballads.  Something that had been unheard of in a hard rock band like Genesis, but had increasingly been popping up on there more recent albums.  The song 'Alone Tonight' was one of the more successful of the songs on this album, and was a good example of how Genesis was attempting to appeal to a broader audience (namely women, who were a small minority in the prog rock audience).  This album is where they started to alienate their old fans, and this fan divide that has never fully healed. <br /> <br/>Personally, I don't mind the occasional love song, but, as in all things, there are good and bad love songs, and I never thought Genesis was particularly good at writing them.  Still, they must have been doing something right because they tended to be their most successful songs. <br /> <br />This album is rather long, at least for an lp release (55 minutes), and it has a lot of really good stuff.  Enough to fill a 45 minute record.  But there also was a lot of annoying filler to this album.  And, unfortunately, the filler is sappy and boring stuff that I could have lived with out. <br /> <br />I'm also dearly missing the hypnotising acoustic melodies that used to be their trademark.  It had disappeared by this point, and already Banks had stopped using the mellotron, on of my favorite instruments.  They would lose their acoustic sound in favor of a more electronic synthetic sound that I never much liked.  This is also the last album where Tony Banks used a Hammond Organ. Unfortunately, it gets worse from here on out.
B00003CXA4|5.0|Excellent movie... I was just spellbound while watching this movie at my friend's place and bought one for myself. I am not a great movie buff, but this is an excellent masterpiece. I do agree that there should have been a Hindi track for Indian viewers too considering it was made in both languages at a time. Also as the other reviewer has pointed out, there should have been a bit about the lead Indian actors in that movie. It is strange that none of them are highlighted here. Most of the western audience would know more about their actors and their achievements... It would have made more sense to highlight some of the achievements of the actors from this part of the world too. Go own it and u'll never regret it.
B00067ZONA|3.0|This is probably the best compilation collection Genesis has released yet (not including the archives).  It covers every era except their 1960's period (but I don't think they own the rights to those songs).    It's not perfect though, there a quite a few gems missing, and I probably would have switched out more than a few tracks in favor of others.  I also think they put too much focus on the 3 albums from 83-91, and too little focus on the 6 albums from the Gabriel era (particularly since one of them was a double album).  Still, this is a good way to introduce someone to Genesis, in a backwards fashion (especially since it saves the best for last).    Every major release except their first album is represented here, some more than others, but you get the general idea of how this band evolved from its prog rock beginnings.    Aside from all the songs being remixed, there is nothing new here, so it's clear this is targeted to the new potential fan who is just getting introduced to Genesis.  Unfortunately, because of the price, it may be hard to convince a casual listener to buy this 3 disc set.  Perhaps a cheaper 2 disc set would have been more appropriate.  A track listing like this would have satisfied both those look for hits, and those who want to get a taste of all eras of Genesis:    Disc One   1. The Silent Sun  2. Dusk   3. The Musical Box  4. Watcher of the Skies  5. Can-Utility and the Coastliners  6. I Know What I Like   7. Firth of Fifth   8. The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway  9. Fly on a Windshield  10. Broadway Melody of 1974  11. Anyway  12. Carpet Crawlers  13. Blood on the Rooftops  14. Ripples  15. Follow You Follow Me     Disc Two   1. Dance on a Volcano  2. Turn it On Again  3. Misunderstanding  4. Abacab  5. Mama  6. That's All   7. Takin' it all Too Hard  8. Invisible Touch   9. Tonight, Tonight, Tonight   10. In Too Deep  11. Throwing it all Away  12. No Son of Mine  13. I Can't Dance  14. Never a Time  15. Hold on my Heart  16. Shipwrecked  17.Harlequin

B000002J1O|5.0|Genesis, by this point in their careers, had really hit their stride.  This is their fifth album, and their strongest up to this point (the next one was better).  Instrumentally, the band were in their prime, they had mastered their instruments.  Compositionally, they were experienced yet still had a lot of fresh ideas.  It's obvious that, given these conditions, this album would be one of their best, and it certainly is. <br /> <br />Gabriel by this point, had perfected his stage persona, and I think really became comfortable with expressing his voice on this album.  It sounds stronger on this album, than on any previous album. <br /> <br />Dancing with the Moonlit Knight is a great example of a prog rock mini epic.  It starts off beautifully, with only Gabriel's voice heard.  Soon he is joined by some beautiful piano and acoustic guitar playing.  But soon, the song changes gears and gets frantically heavy, bursting with solos and Gabriel's chaotic singing.  It then ends with some hypnotic acoustic playing, which had been the bands trademark for some time. <br /> <br />I Know What I Like was actually the band's first hit.  It's actually one of their funny songs (there is usually one or two on each Genesis album).  But it has a catchy hook that made it ideal for radio play.  Not one of their best, but a really good song. <br /> <br />Firth of Fifth is gloriously epic, and the best song on the album.  The music is beautiful, powerful, and impressive, with some of Gabriel's best vocals.  It's one of best Genesis songs, and has become a staple of their live shows ever since. <br /> <br />More Fool Me is a Phil Collins song, sung by Phil, and featuring him on acoustic guitar.  It's a love song, not surprisingly, and it is one of his better love songs. <br /> <br />The Battle of Epping Forest is another funny song, this one much more epic in scale and execution.  Some top notch playing here. <br /> <br />After the Ordeal is an instrumental between mainly Steve Hackett onacoustic guitar and Tony Banks on piano.  It is probably the best instrumental Genesis has ever recorded.  It is quite beautiful. <br /> <br />The Cinema Show is another stunning epic in two parts.  The first part is mainly acoustic, with some great Peter Gabriel singing with Collins singing backup.  The second half is a very complex and impressive sounding instrumental.  Phil's drumming, in particular, sounds very impressive on this song.  It also flows into Aisle of Plenty which is a reprise of Dancing with the Moonlit Knight.  A very fitting end to a great album from start to finish.
0312995423|2.0|I've read the DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons, and although I thought they were severly flawed, I did enjoy reading them. I can't say the same thing for Digital Fortress. Yes, it's a quick read, but it's a dull one as well. Like in his other novels, Brown's facts are wrong (regarding atomic bombs, Enigma, modern Spain, etc.) and there is subtle anti-Catholicism here as well, most notably, a shooting spree during Mass. (note to Brown, Spaniards can't do it first - you CANNOT have Communion before the consecration!)<br /><br />Over all, this is boring read, with unsympathetic characters and a really obvious and predictable plot. There were no surprises here. Skip this one.
B000002J1S|5.0|The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway tells the story of Rael and his adventures in the after-life.  The story could be interpreted in many different ways, but the narrative is so clever and clear that it's actually the most well written concept album to date. <br /> <br />In many ways, it's similar to Pink Floyd's 'The Wall', in that the story is quite narrative, dark and twisted, contains many tracks that flow into each other, and is lengthy (95 minutes).  Don't get me wrong, The Wall is a great album, but this one is many times better.  The lyrics are brilliant, even moreso than Waters' (which tends to be a little too angsty for me), and the music is powerful, beautiful, and evil sounding. <br /> <br />This album also stands the test of time well, it doesn't sound the least bit dated.  The band was at their peak with this album, and it clearly shows with their excellent compositions and technical skill with their instruments.  Peter Gabriel's voice, as always, is powerful and emotional, and Phil Collins sings with him quite a bit on this album for some wonderful harmonies. <br /> <br />There are a few moments, however, where the album seems to drag.  Brian Eno was involved in this album, and his ambient influence made it in as well, and many tracks often sound like filler.  Still, the ambient tracks are beautiful and well suited to the story the band is trying to tell.  This is impressionist rock music at its best.

B000002J27|5.0|After Peter Gabriel left they weren't sure who would replace him as lead singer.  On Steve Hackett's solo album, The Voyage of the Acolyte, they experimented a bit with different vocalists.  Hackett sang one song, Phil Collins another, and had a classically trained female singer for another.  Phil Collins seemed to be the clear choice for the next Genesis album.  He had been their drummer, and main backup singer for Gabriel, and also had sung lead on a couple songs on past Genesis albums. <br /> <br />Could Genesis survive without Gabriel?  The answer is yes!  And this first album without him is actually one of their best. <br /> <br />Dance on a Volcano proved that Genesis was still a powerful force to be reconed with even without Gabriel.  Collins, who had normally sung the more angelic and higher pitched parts of songs now presented a more masculine and powerful voice on a much heavier and rocking track. <br /> <br />Entangled brought the band back to their more hypnotic acoustic sounds that had been their trademark since the early days.  Once again, Collins showed his veratility by singing the more angelic parts. <br /> <br />Squonk is one of their funny songs, and it also proved to be a minor hit. <br /> <br />Mad Man Moon is a beautiful mini-epic with some very nice piano, guitar and mellotron playing. <br /> <br />Robbery, Assault and Battery is another joke song, this one goofier, but with an insanely fast and impressive instrumental section in the middle.  The band's instrumental technique had indeed improved with this album. <br /> <br />Ripples... is another soft mini-epic, with a rather dark yet beautiful piano and guitar section in the middle.  This is probably the best song on the album, definitely one of their best. <br /> <br />The title track is another joke song, this one not quite as good as the rest of the album, but still a decent enough song. <br /> <br />Los Endos is a very impressive fast and furious instrumental that essentially ties some ofthe themes from Dance on a Volcano and Squonk together to bring the album to a close.  There is also a nice \\"goodbye\\" to Gabriel when some lyrics from supper's ready are sung.  A great end to a great album.
B0000025H4|4.0|Actually this is a 5 star effort, but I deducted 1 star because they didn't make this a double album. That and the fact they didn't put Saints in Hell on this.<br /><br />I never could decide what posed a more impressive sight, Halford on stage flanked by Tipton and Downing, or Meine on stage flanked by Jabbs, Schenker, and Buchholz, but I do know one thing: back in the late 70's both the Scorps and Priest were putting out hellacious live albums.<br /><br />The Scorps came out with Tokyo Tapes, and Priest countered with unleashed in the East (live in Japan).  Although both of these were surpassed by Deep Purple's Made in Japan, (not to be confused with Iron Maiden's Maiden Japan) they are still outstanding efforts...<br /><br />Exciter gets it going, and then Running Wild, Sinner, The Ripper and The Green Manalishi just bowl you over.  The first 3 minutes of Sinner are absolutely amazing (I'm listening to it again as I type).  The pace slows a little for Diamonds and Rust (no one could keep it up that long) and then BAM Victim of Changes cranks it back up again. The album ends with Tyrant and Genocide which are also decent tracks.  (The re-released CD includes 4 additional songs, but I haven't gotten around to buying it yet)<br /><br />Both the Scorps and Priest would go on to release more live stuff, but if you really want to know what REAL LIVE METAL sounded like, get their 1978 releases.  If you don't like them, then you don't like metal..

B000001DVD|5.0|Isn't it sad when you have to say that a band's 2nd major release is their best. Unfortunately this is the case with Def Leppard.  From the opening riff on 'Let it Go' to the 'Am I stoned or what No NO NO echo' on the aptly titled last song, this album is just awesome.<br /><br />Be careful though, in their zeal to make as much money as they can, Def Leppard re-released this album with an extra song entitled 'Me and my Wine' and while the song is OK, as payment for the song you have to listen to a synthetically altered Bringin' on the Heartbreak' which absolutely blows...<br /><br />If you didn't see Def Leppard either before or during their Pyromania tour you missed a special treat.  Raw, inspired, ram it down your throat rock.. If you saw them in later years you were probably more impressed with the sites in the crowd then you were with the music.<br /><br />Is this album as 'refined' as later Lepard albums.. No.. But what would you rather jam to, an unrefined Let It Go or a polished 'Pour Some Sugar On Me'?..what a freaking joke)<br /><br />Def leppard released two great albums, this one and On through the night, then Mutt Lange AKA Mr Shania Twain (after producing High and Dry) started tinkering with them, leading to Pyromania, which was the beginning of the end. Joe Elliot decided that it was more fun singing silly love songs to teen age girls, and the party ended for the head bangers. Yeah it was great to go to Def Leppard concerts, not for the music but for the women, but after awhile it was almost an embarrassment to say that you were seeing them live...<br /><br />So do yourself a favor, Buy this, buy On through the night, and then if you want to waste some money on watered down Def Leppard buy their greatest hits. At least with the greatest hits you get the best of their worst.
B000028U0Y|5.0|I've never really like live albums, live shows yes, but a live recording seemed like seeing a lion at the zoo as opposed to seeing one on a african plain.  Similar but a little disappointing.  But this recording is an exception.  Johnny's patter with the cons, the quiet noise in the background of prison speakers and cells opening and closing all add an amazing amount of atmosphere.  Ive recommended this to cure fans and black flag fans, everyone loves it, spend the 12 dollars for a slice of heaven
B000001FKY|2.0|Black Sabbath once released a greatest hits album entitles 'We Sold Our Souls For Rock And Roll'.. This album should have been called 'We Sold Out To Play Some Kiddie Pop'.. (do you take sugar.. one lump or two?)<br /><br />I guess in order to garner 'good recommendations' for my review I could 'sell out' (like Def Leppard did) and give this cd 5 stars, but then I would be doing you all a diservice (which is exactly what Def Leppard did to their original fan base)<br /><br />Fortunately one of my friends bought this when it was originally released, and saved me from wasting any of my money on it.<br /><br />This album and band rivals Krokus and the Blitz (yeah I know Krokus wasn't British) as epitomizing the rapid decline of Metal and the death of the British Invasion.  Over produced records, ripped blue jeans, made for video songs, big hair. By selling out, Def Leppard ushered in the Bon Jovi, Warrent, Poison, Winger (now there's a classic..LOL)Cinderella hair band era.  Who really cared if the music was any good as long as you looked good in spandex and didn't run out of hair spray..<br /><br />What really makes this album poor is it seems like Def Leppard forgot how to write songs in which you hear drums, vocals and guitars at the same time.  Listen to the 'hits' (try typing that with a straight face) off of this album.. For the most part whenever Elliot is singing all you hear is a drum beat and a few guitar chords.  By this point in their careers Savage, Collon, Clark and the boys were more worried that they could clap their hands above their heads to the drum beat as Elliot swooned the ladies then they were about playing some kick @$$ jams.<br /><br />Go ahead listen to the album again and then compare it to the first two.  Where are the guitars? They are nowhere to be found. Metallic crunch? What album were you listening to?  This is  kiddie pop. It may be kiddie pop at its best, but it's still kiddie pop.<br /><br />I gave this album 2 stars, only because as hard as it is to believe, Def Leppard went on to release even poorer albums.<br /><br />I do have one question to anyone who claims that this is the greatest album of all time. What runs through your head as you listen to Joe Elliot pleading to be dumped in Sugar. I know the women are thinking does he want Sweet and Low or granular, as for you males... oh never mind..<br /><br />Oh yeah, and PLEASE, how could anyone have the nerve to compare ANYTHING on this album to Black Sabbath... Good grief...to release even poorer albums.     I do have one question to anyone who claims that this is the greatest album of all time.

Unlike many of you who probably weren't born when this was released, I remember the period when these albums came out (well I sort of remember, some of it was a blurr)..<br /><br />First, what was metal?  It was raw agression.  There was no need to fine tune.  You went into the studio drunk, you plugged in, you played, you recorded and you left.. THAT was it.. But what you got was incredible metal.<br /><br />Just listen to this stuff.  Rock Brigade, Hello America, It could be you, wasted, rocks off.. This stuff was awesome.. I won't go into detail on every song because earler reviewers do an adequate job, but this album absolutely rocks.<br /><br />Is this album as 'refined' as later Lepard albums.. No.. But what would you rather jam to, an unrefined Wasted or a polished 'Pour Some Sugar On Me'?..what a freaking joke)<br /><br />Def leppard released two great albums, this one and High and Dry, then Mutt Lange AKA Mr Shania Twain (after producing High and Dry) started tinkering with them, leading to Pyromania, which was the beginning of the end.

The gal who plays Margaret is just perfect-she's a nineteenth century I-am-woman-hear-me-roar and you just want to high five the gal as she insists upon doing the right thing, even when it costs her. She's a 'lil spitfire, don't let the drab dresses fool you! <br /> <br />And of course, let's get to Mr. Thorton. Armitage is just flawless, you can't deny it. His Mr. Thorton can smolder with the best of them(aka Colin Firth) and yet his doesn't let the smolder obscure his character, warts and all(and even those come off attractive in some odd way).. <br /> <br />And the ending scene? Geesh, talk about a big payoff for us modern viewers! I know some have criticized the ending for the \\"payoff\\"(I won't spoil it for you folks) for not following the eitquette of the day or the book, but who cares! Let's just say I'm buying my husband one of those hot little white poet-like shirts asap and making him meet me at a train station this weekend... <br /> <br />ps-I have a sister who HATES Victorian and Regency literature and  thinks most of these period dramas are too corny etc. I actually got her to sit down and watch the first episode, and the girl was hooked. She loved Margaret's spunky spirit and social commentary, so this really is a crowd pleaser in alot of ways...
B000001EHS|1.0|Wow where to begin?    Do I start buy saying that this is a super attempt by a band to cash in on selling out?  It's like getting taxed twice.  First you get people to buy your albums by selling out, then you re-package the songs on the 'sell-out' albums and sell them again. Talk about Capitalism..    Had the order of these songs been reversed, they could have called it 'The Decline of the British Invasion.  Track 1 would have been 'Bringin' on the Heartbreak', a classic, although not their best (none of their best made it onto this album).  The songs on the album would then decline in quality until bottoming out with 'Pour Some Sugar on Me'.    It truly is astounding that only 1 song from the first 2 albums made this collection.  I think Def Leppard is in denial of the fact that they once actually played incredibly awesome hard rock.  By putting anything from the first two albums (except a balad) on this collection, it would have been too easy for listeners to compare the songs an see how far this band has fallen.      Could you imagine if this collection started with 'Let it Go' and then followed that with 'Pour Some Sugar on Me'  It would have illustrated what a joke the latter song really is.  This probably explains the reasoning for leaving Switch 625 off of the album.  Even though it really is the conclusion to Bringing on the Heartbreak, it was just too heavy for this collection.    So go ahead and buy this garbage, but while you're listening to it try not to think \\"If only I had bought one of their first 2 albums, I'd be listening to some really great rock right about now'.     This album belongs in a vault, never to be taken out.
B0001CCXY8|3.0|ok im not going to say that these guys are bad because i dont have the cd and i cant judge people or artists that i dont know..so i gave it a three stars because i thought that there so called \\"growls\\" made me laugh so hard that i almost cried!!...i dont know much about death metal so im definatly not going to say that they dont know how to do it because its a hell of a lot better than i can do...soo i guess...if you like death metal try this out by the samples and if you like it...get it and if not...try other stuff...common sense people...im out
0553213105|5.0|Excellent classic novel. I loved how there are a variety of story lines going at once. It takes a few chapters to get past some of the old English language, but once you get a few chapters into it you can't put it down. It's a good novel about relationships - from family to romantic - in a setting of the early 1800's in England.

The origin and nature of Porco's curse are never fully explained, although the question does arise in the movie.
B00001NFCY|4.0|well Although alot of people are dissapointed with this album i still will listen to it, maybe i just can put up with music or maybe some people dont know good music, but either way, i think creed is awesome, not only do they play awesome music on every cd they put out, they have christian refrences in them, and how many bands can put out music liek that and have hit songs... not many, besides that they are hard rock band that had the potential to do somthing but held back... thats what i think anyways, and about the cd i think its pretty good, its slower then their first cd and way harder, which makes it cool because not one of their cds is the same, their newest one and last for them was the best, it was a mix between hard rock and fast pased beat, the lyrics on the other hand were a bit not as \\"serious\\" or more to the point some could say, anyways i give this cd 7/10 (average) because its nothing bad but nothing extreme~

B0009I7NNA|3.0|Ok to start this off i love this new cd the style and the amazing guitar solos pick it up... anyways i took some time to look at a few reviews on this cd/band... All i can say is that this band is amazing, sadly the fact they did become sell outs is very sad and annoying, but that means nothing to the cd, M.Shadows did get surgery to anyone who doesnt know that so now you can stop saying he has a whiney voice for not knowing the true reason, its not like they just dont want to scream... anyways aside from that they have changed their style alot and for better or for worse i dont know, all i know is that they have become more popular with this one and if thats what they want, they sure as hell got it off bat country. Dont get me wrong bat country is an awesome song the guitar solo is so awesome i listen to it everyday... but when you see the music video 5 times on tv in one day, it makes u want to throw away the cd because you can just turn on the tv and there it is! The new album from a7x is more music then vocal anyways, i mean wake up how many solos are in this cd? not to mention their older cds with the drum solos in there too! anyways a7x you could say is a poser of Iron maidens because they have songs such as M.I.A or Beast and the Harlot which are similar to some iron maiden songs, that may be true, but that doesnt have anything to do with their music, people look at bands and compare them all the time all that tells me is that iron maidens were an influence to them in some way, and if they are then they did a hell of a good job making those war songs and biblical songs! if you want to rate this cd i give it 10/10 great beginning song (beast and the harlot) great mix of music like bat country, burn it down, sidewinder, seize the day, strength of the world, and a sweet ending to their Album M.I.A, so yes there is a lot of great songs i didnt even mention all them, but to sum it all up if you want hardcore screaming with awesome solos i would prefer their firstone, a faster paced screamo the second, but if you are buying this cd because of bat country or you like the new style, please dont even look at their old albums because no one likes posers and people who force themselves to listen to older albums to make them seem cooler, i dont know just dont, it doesnt make you look cool it makes you somthing we call a POSER so anyways singing go for this cd yelling older ones (and i would give this a 5 but this isnt just on the fact this cd kicks ass and more people look at less stars so they can see why they complain lol you know its true!)

B000006045|5.0|You've heard their music in commercials and movies and may not have realized it. I didn't until I picked this album up within the past six months. Of it, Blue Lines, and 100th Window (only ones I have), it's the best, and that is clearly in consensus with other MA fans. This is a very good album...just really interesting and exceptional musically.    If you're at all interested in this kind of music, you cannot go wrong with Mezzanine.    EDIT: I've actually been listening to this album more over the last 24 hours and am now of the opinion that it's more masterful than I originally thought. It's easily listenable from start to finish. There are no weak songs. If you think you've found a weak song, you've just not listened to it enough yet. This album will be especially enjoyable for somebody with a good sound setup (be it high quality earphones or, preferably, a nice car stereo) because some of its bass lines are truly praiseworthy.    As others have alluded to, or stated, this is the kind of CD that holds a constant spot near the top of one's music collection. I knew it was good, but only now do I fully understand that fact. Isn't it a breath of fresh air when a single album is full of such greatness and not just one or two songs, as with 99% of the music out there?
B0009QTS1M|3.0|They did a great job with the entire film. But, they did a poor job with the audio. What happened to the DTS ES 6.1 audio <br />that the first release had. It makes this a downer. Come on <br />are they planning to hit us with another version?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Plenty of people have already stated how good the show is.  Let me just say that I'm a big sci-fi junky.  My wife is not.  However, this is the only sci-fi TV series that she would not only watch with me, but she loved the show!  We both wish they wouldn't have cancelled it.  Anyhow, we own the DVD set, and we've watched every episode an additional 2 times since the original airing.  There are some truly funny moments in those episodes, and some great drama as well.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Really, really bad supernatural Keanu Reeves stinker with Keanu Revees giving a all time worse performance with a one dimensional character that is so annoying that you would want him to get killed off in a very painful way. The script makes no sense what so ever and the direction is a joke. The dialog is so poorly written that you can't really believe what you are hearing from time to time and the setting is so dark in places that you can't see damn thing from time to time. Of all the actors involved with this crappy film, Rachel Weisz has the hardest role in the film because not only does she have to make you care about what is happening with her story, she has to pick up all of Keanu's acting slack in order for you to even feel something for his selfish and miserable character.  She is like the majority of the reviews have said over and over again the best and only good thing about this movie. Another shot out goes to Peter Stormare, whose brief appearance as Satan is the only bright spot next to Weisz's great performance that makes the movie somewhat watchable.     Other than the efforts made by Weisz and Stormare, the movie is a huge misfire and not even their great performances could have saved it from itself.     One star
B0009MDPYM|5.0|I really loved this movie about good and evil.  I watched it at someone's house and then bought it and watched it three times in a two day period.  Kenau Reeves really plays a good part in this movie and there is one part that really got to me.  You have to watch it yourself.

0792164903|5.0|In the middle of the mist we hear a horse ride, accelerated rhythm, until the fog dissipates and we see an impressive figure, his presence irradiates pure evil, his arm is ready to take another head.<br /><br />Tim Burton's back to the macabre.<br /><br />Gothic, colorful and vampire-ish, Sleepy Hollow shows us the vision of this extravagant director about Washington Irving's tale. It's a melodramatic story about the quarrel between intellect and emotion, pragmatism and mysticism, science and superstition.<br /><br />The sleek Constable Ichabod Crane puts science above everything. His controversial brainstorms take him to investigate a series of murders committed in the local community of Sleepy Hollow. Four people have been beheaded and everyone thinks the murderer is a headless horseman, a fierce war mercenary that came from the dead to take his vengeance.<br /><br />Ichabod will try to rationalize the facts, while he struggles to resist the charms of Katrina Van Tassel, only to reach the inevitable conclusion: that there is not a logical explanation for the murders.<br /><br />Visually stunning, Sleepy Hollow has some elements from the horror genre. A demonic villain that terrorizes a town. But it's also a gothic adventure with a pale hero running through skeletal trees to rescue his damsel in distress. That the hero is in more danger that the damsel is one of the great twists in this film.<br /><br />As Ichabod Crane, Johnny Depp is an exquisite mix of neurosis, extravagances, manias and quirkiness. He's the antithesis of the classical hero, a coward with a brilliant mind but no experience in how to defeat an evil ghost. He's funny without being clowny.<br /><br />Alongside him, there's a cast of excellent actors that help recreate Burton's story.<br /><br />Sleepy Hollow is a little over the top in his drama management and his approximation to comedy. But still, is a movie that achieves to recreate a world of fantasy with great realism, thanks to the skills of those who imagined an 18 century village that it could well be hell's portal.<br /><br />Sleepy Hollow also confirms that Burton continues to ride on the dark side of creativity, hearing his own voices. In the movies, that's an enough excuse to feel forever grateful.to the skills of those who imagined an 18 century village that it could well be hell's portal. <br /> <br />Sleepy Hollow also confirms that Burton continues to ride on the dark side of creativity, hearing his own voices.

184576045X|5.0|In a note in the back of \\"The Hard Goodbye,\\" Frank Miller explains that this one got away from him. What was supposed to be a 48-page crime thriller turned into a 200-page graphic novel, all because Marv, the story's brutal misanthropic protagonist, started bossing Miller around. If you have seen \\"Sin City\\" the movie where Mickey Rourke steals the film as Marv, then you can understand Miller's explanation. You will understand it even more when you read the graphic novel, the first volume in the Miller's comic noir saga.  Artistically Miller goes more for refinement than massive experimentation in future books, but in terms of the character of Marv and the gritty narrative, \\"The Hard Goodbye\\" is not only the first \\"Sin City\\" tale, it is still the best.<br /><br />For me Frank Miller began the road that ends in \\"Sin City\\" with \\"Daredevil\\" #164, which retold the hero's origin. There is a series of panels in which Daredevil is chasing down the Fixer, the man who arranged the fight that Battling Murdock refused to throw. In each frame Daredevil gets closer to his quarry and cutting across the panels is a line representing the Fixer's heart beat, which goes from blind panic to full cardiac arrest before flatlining. It was at that point that I knew Miller was starting to think of what he could do with art in a comic book. After his work on \\"Daredevil\\" there was \\"Ronin\\" and \\"The Dark Knight Returns,\\" and eventually Miller gets to Marv.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Marv is the walking path of destruction that dominates this narrative. He is extremely violent, deeply disturbed, and whatever medication he is taking is just not doing the job. Still, he is a sympathetic figure because pretty much everybody he is maiming and killing are the real scum of the earth and he is on a mission to avenge the death of Goldie, the beautiful blonde who gave him a toss in the hay. He falls asleep in bed with her, having one of those moments of true happiness that never bodes well, and wakes up with her dead and the cops on their way. Marv is being set up, but that is incidental in his mind to the fact somebody killed Goldie, so somebody has to pay along with everybody else who stands in his way. The grand irony here is Marv and his interior monologues are the voice of sanity by the time he finds the killer.<br /><br />The characters and the dialogue are easy to characterize as Mickey Spillane types on steroids. Then there is Miller's artwork as he explores what can done with just black and white on a page. The result is wildly experimental and sometimes you can a sense of how rough Miller's ideas are by the time he finishes a page. The first page of the story is more black than white, with Goldie's lips, the outline of her hair, the white skin exposed by the strapless gown and gloves etched out in seductive folds sets the tone for the artwork. The second page is the opposite with more white than black and offers a more conventional view of Marv and Goldie, and already you like the first page better. The third page offers a synthesis of the first two and it is like Miller is laying out the new ground rules. There are figures reduced to silhouettes except for hair or teeth (or bandages), and others reduced to white images against a field of black. Then we get to Marv standing in the rain in Chapter 8 and looking at the statue of Cardinal Roarke, at which point Miller is trying something completely different from the rest of the book.<br /><br />I have no doubt that if Miller was to do \\"The Hard Goodbye\\" today that there would be significant changes in the artwork that would provide a refinement of the raw energy displayed here. There are times when the justification for the artwork seems to clearly be that it is different from the pages Miller has just drawn as opposed to be the best way of illustrating that part of the narrative. But this is the first story in an ongoing series, so allowances can be made if Miller really did decide to do a page a certainly way for no other reason than he had not done one that way yet. After all, it is not like he was coming up with 200 different pages of artwork and by the time you get to Chapter 8, which I think is artistically far and away the best of the entire graphic novel, it is equally clear Miller knows exactly what he is doing and all of the pieces are falling into place. The joy of watching the art evolve in this story makes up for the rough patches.<br /><br />These stories were originally published in issues #51-62 of the Dark Horse comic book series \\"Dark Horses Presents\\" and in the \\"Dark Horse Presents Fifth Anniversary Special.\\" This second edition has come out with the rest of the extant \\"Sin City\\" collection in term to be gobbled up by fans of the movie version and those who come from the theater to the graphic novel will probably be surprised how faithful Robert Rodriguez was to Frank Miller's story and vision.

B000AARKOO|2.0|I was expecting a great movie, based on the subject matter and the director.  Unfortunately, this film left much to be desired.  First, the positives:  <br />1. Some great scenes. I enjoyed the scenery and the sets. Many scenes were interesting within themselves.  <br />2. Liam Neeson. Had he been in the film longer, he might have been able to carry it. He was great.  <br />3. The leper King. This character was a fascinating interpretation of the real King Baldwin IV. I immensely enjoyed every scene he was in and he always kept me interested.  <br />4. Some very good large scale battles.  <br /> <br />Now the negatives:  <br />1. There was no real point to the story. Although it was loosely based on history, I don't count off for its historical failings. However, this story was about Balien, and there seemed to be no meaningful story about him.  <br />2. There is no reason to care about what happens to the characters. With the exception of the Baron(Neeson), I didn't feel like I knew any of the characters. The interesting ones are killed early, and many of the rest are caricatures. Balien is an odd fellow and I didn't care about him. I don't need white hats versus black hats, but this film gives us no reason to cheer for either side.  <br />3. Many scenes are ridiculous. This film should have been named \\"How to Succeed at Crusading without really trying\\". Balien goes from not knowing how to hold a sword to being a sword master, thanks to a 5 minute lesson. EVERTHING goes his way from day one: King thinks he's great a first sight; Princess falls in love with him at first sight; on his first day in the Holy Land he makes friends with the 2nd most powerful Muslim in the area, and so on. I can give wide latitude to an action film, but this was over the top.  <br />4. Terrible portrayal of Christians and the Catholic church in particular. I'm not a Catholic, and I understand that there were and are some corrupt priests. However, I think that they are the exception, not the rule. In this film, every single priest is an evil coward. Mr. Scott doesn't seem to care for religion, but he goes too far against the Christians. Meanwhile, the Muslims in the film are given a free pass, in spite of the historical crimes they committed.  <br />5. Several other small things. I think that Orlando Bloom is a competant, likeable actor, but he is over his head here. The love interest story line is a waste of time. The hand to hand action is not nearly as good as it was in Gladiator.  <br /> <br />Overall, this was a disappointing film. I would rank it as slightly behind Troy in terms of quality and story. <br /> <br />
B00004RFCM|5.0|So, the season begins!  I must say, I missed many of these episodes on TV and  things are starting to fall into place now.  This refreshing comedy is just what woman ordered.  It brings a new look on how the modern woman is and what some men are really like.   <br />The only thing I didn't like was the last episiode which left me hanging.  I immediately ordered season TWO!   <br />Those who have an open mind and just want to laugh a while, go ahead, watch it!
B000002I25|5.0|Let me make this easy. Every track is, without a doubt, the best of the doors. Start here and then work your way up, cuz they're all good. Solid, solid stuff, this album will blow your mind. After this one if you want to keep going (which you will) go in this order....<br /><br />LA WOMAN....  STRANGE DAYS.... WAITING FOR THE SUN... SOFT PARADE... MORRISON MOTEL.... Then any live albums that you can find. These are all good, but make sure you've heard the whole first album first. Do not waste your time with a greatest hits.
B000003TA4|5.0|First off, I must say that I owe Nirvana. A lot. If it wasn't for them and this album, I'd probably be floating along on the by now DANGEROUSLY plastic, fake corporate radio waves, knowing that there was something missing, but never finding out WHAT. <br /> <br />Thanks to Nirvana, I've been exposed to bands like The Wipers, Mudhoney, Scratch Acid, Bikini Kill...which has led me to delve deeper into the indie/experimental musical landscape of then and now. Basically, I owe Nirvana my very musical \\"life\\". <br /> <br />That being said, I personally think that Kurt's best songwriting was on In Utero, and in songs like \\"About a Girl\\", \\"All Apologies\\", and \\"Aneurysm\\". However...Nevermind is undeniably an essential part of any record collection. It's an essential part of the history of music in the 20th century. Without this album and the (by now grossly overplayed, but still seminal and brilliant) track \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" to act like a lightning rod, it's very likely that the other wonderful bands like Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, etc. would've languished in obscurity...or reached less success than they did. <br /> <br />So...I don't care if some upstart little snot-nosed kid of today is deaf to what this band meant. I don't care if some rabid Pearl Jam fan is sporting a 14+ year-old grudge due to a pointless musical rivalry. Whether you preffer other albums to it or not, you still have to admit that Nevermind was and is an incredible record, and a vital piece of the history of the 90's. Whatever happened after (and whatever the media did to exploit it) shouldn't eclipse the importance of the record.  <br /> <br />So...buy it, listen to it, enjoy it...and if you don't, then pass it on to someone who does. This is 'Alternative' before the label was applied to the music...before other bands tried to capitalize on its popularity and hop on the bandwagon...before 'grunge' became a fashion. This is where it broke. <br /> <br />An important notch on any musical calendar. <br /> <br />P.S: And to hate a band because others like them, and put down their record on a site like this is just childish and stupid. Why not go promote the records you like instead of wasting your time trying to put another down? Please, grow up. And if those doing this were around at the time...well, it makes me sad that you're pushing 20-30 and STILL acting like spoiled little kids.

B0000CABBW|4.0|I bought The Whale Rider to show to my grandchildren.  It is a excellent way to show a girl as the heroine and how she overcomes being excluded from traditions because of her gender.  It also presents a cultural tie to nature through the native peoples tie to the whales.  Although it is a little predictible from an adult point of view, their love and traditions of life with the whales are presented in a thoughtful and gentle way.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|I bought his CD in July, and I've been captivated by it. He is soo soulful. Every word he sings you can tell is sung with honesty. A truly great artist. I especially love the song Meaning and the lines \\"Mountain, the trail, but you've got it in sight Sometimes the only was is jumping I hope your not afraid of heights.\\"  ..definitely one of my favourite lines. His voice has a Billy Joel ring to it. All in all I strongly suggest getting his cd, it is well worth the money, and he has so much talent. He's got great lyrics, of course his voice is just so amazing...and he's kinda cute ;)!
B000957O7S|5.0|This is a guy-flick that chicks will adore.  The dialogue is compelling.  We rarely \\"buy\\" a film but this one is a must-have.  The Date Doctor's advice is worth heeding, too.  Refreshingly creative--Will Smith outdoes himself.  For all ages!
B0000A2ZO1|4.0|Don't understand the bashing of this flick. Loved the villian, he was perfect. Great performance from him and P. Stewart. As usual I always love Spiner's Data. Would have liked a little more of the cast regulars, but, there's only so much time to develop the unknown characters.....I'm a huge star trek fan and I really enjoyed this. Hope it's not the last.
B00068NVI4|5.0|I am very happy with the DVD from a Audio and Video persepective. Having gone to numerious YES concerts in the 70's this is a real treat. The 2 highlights on this DVD for me are South Side of the Sky and And You And I.  The big disappointment on this DVD was that Chris Squire one of the greats was not up to par and certainly does not come close to his incrediable performance in the Symphonic Yes DVD. If you compare the Ritural on both you will see what I mean. Jon and Steve seem to age like a fine wine.
B000004CYT|5.0|This set is amongst my favorite Beethoven symphonies, only falling in after the classic sounds of Bruno Walter and George Szell. For first timers I would recommend either of those performances (Szell's is at bargain price at the time of this writing and Walter's is at midprice, though quickly going out of print) to start off. I feel that the whole set is totally worthwhile, and I particularly enjoyed the 6th, 9th, and the Egmont overture. I agree with prior reviewers that we can only guess what Beethoven actually heard performed in his time, but I feel that many of the things that were said about these symphonies in \\"period\\" performance are true of any \\"period\\" performance. We can only guess, and Hogwood is world renowned as one of the most savvy guessers out there. <br /> <br />Beyond that, these performances are just great listening at a great price.

From the banality of the daily grind, to the rah-rah corporate baloney spouted by the suspender-wearing yuppy pond-scum. Or the justifiable fear of \\"consultants\\", and the sense of quiet desperation that if you don't find something else to do this just might be as good as it gets, this movie hits all of those maddening aspects of cube-rat life directly on the head with wry wit, and a sly smile.  <br /> <br />Well acted, well-written, and a pure delight to watch. <br /> <br />By the way, I believe you have my thtapler....

B000AM4PBS|2.0|My family & I are HUGE fans of FRIENDS. We own all ten seasons as well as every other Spec Ed DVD collection, and watch them often. Before anyone complains about my \\"2 star\\" rating and/or accuses me of whining about its release (after we bought each season separately), let me explain the reason behind my rating......    I'm not giving this a 2-star rating because I'm mad about having bought all ten seasons separately.  I'm giving the PRODUCT 2 stars as I don't really see any product here at all - This collection consists of the same nine seasons previously released, all boxed up together, along with the recently released Season 10. There isn't any new material or special \\"extras\\" included with this collection, which in my opinion, makes it a waste of money and a missed opportunity. Why the rush to release this series collection? Why not release Season 10 this year and wait a year before releasing the entire series with added features and bonus material? This way, fans of FRIENDS would still have had something to look forward to.  Now that it's all been released (Season 10, as well as the series collection), fans have nothing new to add to their collections.  There was so much that could have been added to this set - additional outtakes, deleted scenes, bloopers, interviews, music, fashion, a special ed book, etc. Not even the one hour retrospect, THE ONE BEFORE THE LAST ONE, that was originally shown the night of the finale is included in this collection (or any individual season for that matter). Looks like fans will never be able to own that special on any DVD collection, which makes me so mad! I would so rather go back & watch that one hour special again & again, than watch all ten openings from every season (which was included on the Series Finale DVD)! Who's bright idea was that?!?    I'm sure it will be nice to have all 10 seasons, packaged together in one boxed set. But the only thing new here is the Special Ed. Collector's box that the set comes packaged in,which is made available for its own separate purchase in the Season 10 collection. It would have made more sense to release Season 10 this year, with only season 10 bloopers & outtakes, THE ONE BEFORE THE LAST ONE, and the other bonus features that are included. Then wait a year and release the Series Collection, with an added bonus disc could that could have included bloopers & outtakes from all ten seasons, as well as other added material & extras - perhaps, the cast's appearances on the Oprah show (from the show's beginning and the end) as well as their appearance on the Tonight Show from the night the finale aired; a look back at how each of the cast members/characters changed & grew throughout the years and what each one has been doing since the series ended; all of the big-name guest stars, the various sets & scene locations, fashions & costumes throughout the series; maybe even a special ed book. There are so many things that could have been added, had the producers just taken their time and really thought about what the fans would want.     Earlier this summer, when it was announced that all 6 seasons of Sex & the City were being released, I thought, \\"That's kinda strange. Most fans have already purchased all 6 seasons, why would they want to buy them all over again?\\" And when I heard that the set was going to cost $300 - well, I thought, \\"That's just ridiculous!\\" Each individual season costs $20-30 (approx. $200 for all 6 seasons). Why would anyone want to spend $100 more just to own the full set in one box? But then I found out that the Full Series Collection would have lots of \\"extras\\" not found on the individual season discs, including a deluxe velvet box and a small \\"companion\\" book. For the average fan, it's probably not worth it to spend the extra money for whatever the extras are, but for the serious fan and/or collector - that's a big deal. Now it made sense to me, and will hopefully be worth the additional cost. But this isn't true about the FullSeries Collection of Friends. There are no special extras in this set. The \\"One with all Ten Seasons\\" is packaged with the same exact discs sold individually as Seasons 1-10. What a waste!    I just think that this is a missed opportunity to give fans of FRIENDS something \\"special\\". If you're going to release a Spec Collector's Edition of all ten seasons, then there should be some added material, bonus features or something that generates a little excitement and makes the fans want to run right out and buy it. It's really a shame, because as big as FRIENDS was and how many fans of the show there still are, there is so much more that could have been included and given to fans - maybe WB & the producers of FRIENDS should have borrowed some ideas from HBO and the producers of Sex & the City. I bet the Sex collection easily outsells the FRIENDS collection just because of all the added material.

B000000W6F|3.0|This is the Smashing Pumpkins first full length CD, after releasing a few singles.  It has that basic Indie feel to it.  It was originally released on an Indie label that Virgin had acquired earlier.  It was produced by Butch Vig who also did Nirvana's Nevermind and eventually went on to form Garbage.    It has all the appearance and sound of an Indie production.  The packaging is cheap and sound quality is slightly rough and not quite polished.  The music style wanders all over the place.    I have to admit that this is the only thing I have heard by the Smashing Pumpkins, so I can't compare it to other albums.  I probably like different tracks than Smashing Pumpkin fans would.    The music is hard rock with influences from a number of places.  I think a lot of the music sounds like something that could come from Black Sabbath, only better.  There are some great rumbling bass guitar passages.  Having the bass upfront is something you don't routinely hear nowadays, especially in the days of jangle rock.    The opening track, I Am the One, sounds like early Journey (before they went pop).  Even the vocals have a quality that a similar to Greg Rollie.    There is some influence from Pink Floyd.  Crush and some other tracks have guitar licks that come right out of David Gilmour's Meddle days.    Bury Me sounds like it could have been performed by the Spin Doctors.    I really enjoy tracks like I Am The One, Crush, Suffer and Window Paine, where the group is innovative in how it melds the different music styles and gives the music's its own hard rock sound.    Other tracks are less innovative or interesting.  Rhinocerus might be a good track, but it repeats the line \\"And she knows\\", just too many times.  It takes up about half of the 6 minute track.  I feel the song is improved by fading out the last 2 minutes of the track.    If you like this mixture of hard rock and psychodelia, you might try Armegeddon or the first 3 Journey ablums.

B0009I7NNA|5.0|Well, I'll just say first off I don't really care for this particular brand of metal and I really don't like this band's previous cds but one of my friends kept raving about it so I decided to give it a listen. <br /> <br />I was blown away. <br /> <br />Although the vocal do suck a lot he DOES sometimes sound good and when he does, it harkens back to glory days of priest and maiden!  But the thing here that is awesome is the music.  Unlike a lot of bands these days, the music is so in depth and full of different things.  Riffs, twin melodies, guitar solos..it's all here.  Musically, this album soundlike something that came out of the new wave of british heavy metal!  I highly suggest you get this even if you don't like the band or this style.
B00005JNJT|5.0|This is the Batman movie I've been waiting for! Tim Burton's Batman was my favorite until now.  The storyline, the action, the sets, acting, this movie surpassed all of the previous batman movies, especially the most recent Joel Schumacher ones which were horrible.  The actors picked for Batman and Ras Al Ghul were perfect, as was Scarecrow. This movie is true to the comic book, thankfully, showing it was NOT the Joker who killed Bruce Wayne's parents. It has that mood you must have for a Batman flick, without a type of pseudo-universe created for him like the Tim Burton movies. Too bad Halle Berry didn't wait for this film to become Catwoman. A better director and costume would have made her the ultimate Catwoman.  <br />Finally, a director that doesn't base his movie on the campy 60's tv series.  I'm already waiting for the sequel.
0553802534|3.0|This is a psychological crime novel about a woman whose husband is killed by a police sniper.  The sniper kills the man because he appears to be ready to shoot his wife.  It turns out that the woman and the police sniper have psychological baggage -- lots of it.  The fact that the sniper kills the husband leads to an intense investigation, which is when all the twisting begins.  The book has a villian that you just love to hate and a lovable child and puppy.<br /><br />I actually enjoyed this book, much to my surprise.  I am usually not a fan of \\"crime format\\" books.  But the book was fairly well written, easy to read, and had some twists that made it impossible to preconceive how the book was going to end.  All in all, not a bad book -- not great -- but not bad.  A good book for reading on an airplane.<br /><br />I will say that the twists and turns became a little confusing and it was somewhat hard to follow.  Right up to the very end, I'm not sure exactly what happened.  Maybe this was the author's intention; I don't know.
0380789019|5.0|Having never read a Neil Gaiman book before, I was told that Neverwhere was a good place to start. And, I have to agree completely.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story...I even liked the tease of an ending.  If you are looking for a book with an original story, a few twists and turns, and some humor, this is the book for you.
B000000OA6|5.0|This, along with News of the World would have to be their best. Their albums in the 1980's were just ok, and this made up for it. <br /> <br />It's has some descent rockers on here with catchy lyrics and even the church-goer song \\"All God's People\\" was performed brillantly! I use to hate it, but it's grown on me! The cat song is a bit camp, but at least he is talking about something different for a change! Try Love Cats, by The Cure, I think it's better. <br /> <br />It's a little on the sad side, you get the feeling you know he's going to die soon! But the emotions he brings on the album are just unbeatable! Check out The Show Must Go On -- the notes he hits at the end along with the guitar solo really expresses his feelings and may very well be about near the end of his life and how it's unfair how we have to die so young. <br /> <br />The title track is good. Nice and long, slightly progy! <br /> <br />I wish they left this album at that, because Made In Heaven was pretty awful! I hate saying that! Because I love Freddie, Roger, Brian and John and I have the upmost respect for them. But these songs... it sounds like Whitney Houston or Bette Midler -- not Queen! I don't know. Every artists has it's lemon album! <br /> <br />This is Queen at one of their best points! It would have been cool to see these songs been performed live! It's a shame he last toured in 1986! Only small venues after that, but I am proud of their achievements! <br /> <br />May Freddie Rest In Peace! God bless him! <br /> <br />It's one of those albums where all kinds of people can enjoy!
B00000J7SS|4.0|It's hard to describe B-Brew.  I'm not a rabid jazz listener, but I do love it, if that makes sense.  If you're more into rock, like me, then you'll either like this or just not get it.  When I first listened to it, it reminded me of Stravinsky, but it also reminded me of Moby!  If you're into either of these guys, then this'll be an interesting listen.  (I'm not into Moby, I'm just saying this album was influential on modern music).  Overall, disc 1 consists of two very impressive, VERY LONG jams that serve better as background music/atmosphere setters.  Disc 2 is superior, consisting of songs that I love to just sit down and listen to.
B00006IK1C|5.0|It all started with Nightmare on Elms Street. He brought out that song Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter... <br /> <br />Great album. Very different than Iron Maiden. More commercial sounding. <br /> <br />I love Tattooed Millionaire (this is the best version of it) but other songs are good on it too. It's just a fun rock n roll album. I love not-too-serious albums. It's great. It worked with Garage DAys with Metallica and it works with Bruce. <br /> <br />I find it incredible that with these albums you get extra tracks! I should re-buy these albums! It's all too good! <br /> <br />Bruce is a metal legend, that deserves greater respect than what he deserves. If you like Maiden, you should give Bruce a try! <br /> <br />He went on to make albums better than Iron Maiden! But just remember, I don't think those Iron Maiden albums were all that bad. Just not as good. <br /> <br />I perfer Bruce Dickinson these days. His latest album is very different from this, and in some ways I miss the old style Bruce. I somehow wish he could incorporate this rock n roll style on all his releases. Sometimes a song doesn't have to be hard and heavy to good. It's the feeling you get from the song that's most important. <br /> <br />What I like about this album is that it's light-hearted. There's too many songs out there these days.
B000002IZM|5.0|<br />Perfect companion to an excellent film. Hauntingly sensuous. <br /> <br />Robert Ruiz
B000001IPP|4.0|As one of punk rocks greatest bands of our generation, this is their first great album. we are introduced to new co-frontman Lars Frederikssen who now adds a whole new dynamic to their sound. the songs on this album are all quick paced, to the point and very catchy with rancids trademark trade off vocals between tim and lars, and with plenty of \\"heys\\" and \\"hos\\". bassist matt freeman still contributes some vocals which is to some detriment to the record but not enough to really negatively impact the albums overall quality. outstanding tracks are \\"Nihilism\\", \\"Radio\\" and the absolutely incredible \\"Harry Bridges\\". this is a must have for any punk rock fan.
B0000AUHPG|4.0|Once Upon a Time in the West features one of the best opening sequences of any film in the genre. Three men, all of them tough and weathered, await the arrival of a mysterious gunman. The sequence features hardly any dialogue, and is punctuated by alternating vistas of an expansive wasteland with closeups of the men's craggy faces. Ennio Morricone's score hardly features at all in these opening twelve minutes, as the Director, Sergio Leone, builds a palpable sense of tension. This scene is the western in microcosm, a twelve minute mini-western, and one could hardly ask for a better overture to begin this epic film. It conveys perfectly the classic western elements: long periods of tension in the expectation of violence, followed by a remarkably quick explosion of violence and resolution. In a western, once the violence starts, it cannot persist for long.<br /><br />Alas, the rest of the film, while good, does not live up to the promise of that initial sequence. (I wonder if any film could.) What we get is a visually stunning film, commencing with the death of the most curious looking Irishman you'll ever see, and ending with...well, I can't give it away. In the middle, we are treated to a rather cliched story of a land-grabbing railroad baron threatening a poor, defenseless homesteader. Charles Bronson plays the hero, unnamed (per Leone convention) and quite a capable killer, and he is effective. Henry Fonda (yes, that Henry Fonda) is a revelation as a cool-eyed sadist and psychopath. He was at least 61 years old when the movie was filmed, and his aged appearance works perfectly in the role. Jason Robards also puts in a good performance, adding some humor to the otherwise solemn proceedings. The film is at its best during the interplay between Fonda and Bronson, as they build up to their inevitable confrontation; and when Leone turns his loving eye to the western landscape. It is at its worst when trying to evoke tragedy from the plight of Claudia Cardinale's character. These scenes are typically accompanied by an overwrought and uncharacteristically ham-handed score by Ennio Morricone. Mr. Morricone's best work was ahead of him, notwithstanding The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.<br /><br />As for the DVD, for an excellent price the special edition delivers a vivid transfer in widescreen (I shudder to think that for so long, Leone's films were viewed in pan-and-scan), and loads of features. The soundtrack has been improved over previous editions: as many of the principal actors are Italians, their voices were dubbed over with the voices of Americans (thus, young Claudia Cardinale sounds like an embittered 40-yr-old). In previous versions of the film, much of the dialog was clearly out of sync with the actor's voices. This edition is a significant improvement. The commentary, however, is mediocre, frequently suffering from that all-too-common affliction wherein the commentators simply tell us what is happening on the screen, as if we were blind and/or dumb. (Film Historian Christopher Frayling is most guilty of this offense: \\"And Fonda turns around, stunned that he has been beaten...\\" Thanks, Sir Christopher. I thought that look of surprise was because he saw his car keys lying on the ground. The other contributors acquit themselves a bit better.)<br /><br />Once Upon a Time in the West is a classic film, a work produced by Leone at the height of his powers. Despite its faults, it deserves a place in the pantheon of the western. This edition does the film justice, and is an excellent value. I highly recommend it to fans of the genre, and to lovers of movies in general.
B0000CAXID|3.0|this is a very solid debut album for the foo fighters. dave grohl deserves a 5 star rating just for virtually performing the entire album himself but the album does suffer somewhat in songwriting. however if you can skip past the disposable fluff such as \\"Big Me\\", then you will find some great songs such as \\"Good Grief\\", and \\"Oh, George\\". also the albums opens up with the raucous and infectious \\"This Is A Call\\". as an introduction to the foo fighters i would more recommend \\"The Colour and The Shape\\" or \\"There is Nothing Left To Lose\\" as they are a bit more accomplished works, but if you already own/like those albums, this is a decent follow up purchase. It gets my 3 stars for its raw sound and infectious hooks.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|For any males out there who think this is a chick flick, let me assauge your fears: this Monday Night Football watching, beer drinking, poker-playing guy think this is one of the Top 10 funniest shows on TV in the last 10 years at least.  If you like dry humor and quick wit delivered by two beatiful women then this is a show for you.
B000020617|4.0|the foo fighters hit their peak with \\"The Colour and The Shape\\" and they continue on the same plain with \\"There Is Nothing Left To Lose\\".  songs like \\"M.I.A.\\" and \\"Live-In Skin\\" are slowburning rockers that contain some of the best hooks grohl has written, while \\"Stacked Actors\\" and the single \\"Breakout\\" just rock out in full foo fighters form. If you are just getting into the foo fighters i would recommend this album or \\"The Colour and The Shape\\".
B0000CDL93|5.0|i dont know much details about the jfk murder. and many people love picking and choosing what to beleive or not.. my common sense tells me that even if 10% of the facts presented in the movie are true and 90% are false, the lone gunman theory is rubbish and must be discredited. maybe the actual Who and the Why is still up in the air, but nothing can make me beleive (other than proving 100% of the &quot;facts&quot; in the movie to be completely false) that oswald acted alone. you can love or hate garrisson or shaw or kennedy etc all you want, opinions aside, facts remain facts (if they indeed are facts). so if you want to convince anyone that oswald acted alone, dont just mention that theres many inaccuracies in the movie. im sure there are... but all it takes is 1 pure fact to prove the lone gunman theory wrong. along with any theory for that matter. anybody who can write a book about this and have the guts to call it CASE CLOSED has some nerve.. talk about arrogance. i will read that book and form my own opinion. but it better prove beyond reasonable doubt that oswald is the only murderer. i do find garrisons conspiracy a little fishy, but i do admit that there must be something fishy underneath all this.. what the government claims truly happened simply makes no sense.<br />all in all, the movie was excellent and opened my eyes and made me want to learn more about this.
B000001IQH|5.0|Rancid, being one of punk rock's greatest of all time, deliver their ultimate masterpiece with \\"...And Out Come The Wolves\\". They debuted with their rough edged self titled record sans  Lars Frederikssen, and then improved on their excellent \\"Let's Go\\" with the introduction of Frederikssen, and now the with wolves comes the juggernaut of their career. From track 1 straight through to the end come an onslaught of punk rock anthems with no filler whatsoever. Amazingly catchy, yet rock just as hard, songs like \\"Roots, Radicals\\", \\"Olympia, WA\\" and \\"Journey To The End Of The East Bay\\" help define what rancid's sound is all about and make you want to learn all of the words right away so you can sing along. i highly recommend this album to anybody interested in checking out rancid or anybody that likes punk rock at all. if you are just starting your rancid collection, this cd should be your first purchase.
B000000W5N|5.0|\\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" is assenine. anyone who would give this album a 1 star doesnt know the stones . And the Beatles dont suck, their music is timeless,if you say the bealtes suck then you dont know their music. Also this album has more than one song to rock out, and a song doesnt have to \\"rock out\\" to be good ! The Stones have a lot of other great songs too, I don't know what he is talking about, try \\"cant you hear me knocking\\" \\"satisfaction\\" 19th nervous breakdown ! get off my cloud. \\"wont get fooled again\\" obviously is a one-minded idiot when it comes to music. I am open to many different kinds of music (except rap) and i respect all diferent kinds of rock even if i dont like it. \\"Wont Get Fooled Again\\" should stop critesizing about what he is not even familiar with. Thanks.
B0000CAXIC|4.0|If you are interested in getting into the foo fighters, then this is the place to start. The underrated gem \\"hey, johnny, Park!\\" is in my opinion, the best foo fighters song still to date. what this album lacks in rawness from their debut, they make up with emotion and more textured songcraft. the production is very slick, maybe a bit overproduced but the songs show Grohl in top form. A true 90's alt rock gem and songs to listen for besides HJP are Wind Up, Doll and February Stars. A good follow up purchase if you like this album would be their follwing record \\"There Is Nothing Left To Lose\\"
B0009K7RES|5.0|Having seen Mark in NYC (8th row!!) about six weeks before picking up this CD, I was yearning for something more like I heard that night in Radio City Music Hall.  Something with a little more raw energy.  This fits the bill nicely - albeit leaving the real fan just wanting more.<br /><br />As others have said, these versions have enough new edge and energy to distinguish themselves from the originals, so that now when I listen to Shangri-La, I prefer these renditions more.<br /><br />The standouts for me are a greatly improved \\"Song for Sonny Liston\\", which was one track from the original release that I found myself occasionally skipping over.  Not so here.  Mark's grittier guitar propels this tune with new vigor.  \\"Boom\\" is much more like what I heard live, but for me the real winner is \\"Everybody Pays\\".  I loved the original version, but this now classifies as a religious experience.  An extra measure of solo at the end extends this versus the original, but I feel only teased.  I want the solo to go on and on and on...<br /><br />How about it Mark?  Treat the diehards to something truly indulgent.  Give us a 12-15 minute version of \\"Everybody Pays\\" with an extended solo at the end that explores this melody completely.  A fan can only dream...
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|This DVD is perfect for Gilmore Girls fans like myself. Great bonus features as well. Certainly never a dull moment in Stars Hollow.
B000059XUI|5.0|Superman II was great, despite the technical problems, somewhat choppy editing and the behind the scenes cast and crew problems it experienced.  It's a story about love, as Superman gives up his superpowers to live as a mortal man with Lois Lane, only to realize he cannot give up his being the savior of mankind.  Three truly evil villans from the Phantom Zone have broken loose and are out to seek their revenge on the son of Jor-El.  How could Superman abandon the Earth?  The truth is he can't, and he must put his love for Lois Lane aside.  A great lesson for kids and adults alike about responsibility.    This is a sad story, as Superman gives up his own wants for the sake of mankind.  He handles it with dignity and grace, knowing that, like the last line of Tale Of Two Cities, it's a far better thing that he does.  We all should follow that example, to be selfless and giving onto mankind and not give into our own self centered wants.
B0000029AP|5.0|Brings back memories and still the same great music from Aerosmith!  Better than ever
B000059Z8J|5.0|I love Superman, everything about him.  I would imagine I was him as a child, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, gifted with superhuman strength and powers.  This was a phenomenal movie that tracked the journey of Superman to the planet Earth and how his heroic acts inspire us all.  There is a message in Superman, which is so simple and corny, but nothing short of true.  We're all heros, we are all great people, and even in our darkest hours our capacity for good will always shine through.  We can all be the light to show us the way to truth and justice. <br /> <br />Of course, how were we to know that someday Christopher Reeve, who played a man sent from the heavens above to lead us to this great aspriration, would end up a quadripeligic?  What a terrible saddness to this otherwise uplifting tale.
B00004W52U|5.0|Operation Ivy's cd, Energy is a really great ska-punk record.  It usually doesn't cost very much, and it has a lot of tracks.  oH yeah, and if pen15 was really a crust punk, he wouldn't be on the internet.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This album provides what I know we have missed for to long..... <br />I mean Rod Stewart's collection of big band classics was a step in the right direction, but Buble brings it up to where it should be. My wife and I don't often buy new records, preferring instead to listen to the radio, but music like this has made us buy this record and all Buble albums including his video called Come fly with me and it's good to. <br />Listen to Buble, he's worth it.
B0002OERI0|5.0|To preface, I'm a young guy that usually prefers classic rock to modern and whose favorite band is the Who.  I always considered Jonny Reznik from the Goo Goo Dolls to be my generation's Pete Townsend, becuase of his complex pop songwriting skills.  I have always enjoyed Green Day, having 4 of their other records, but never held them in the same esteem as other bands.  This record changed my mind.   <br /> <br /> <br />I got this record last week, and I am still amazed.  This is no holds barred the best new record i've heard in a long long time.  I can't find fault with any tracks, it flows well, was written well, and has a cohesive plot.  It has 2 mini-opras (Jesus of Suburbia and Homecoming), a la the Who's \\"A Quick One, While He's Away\\"  It is the best rock opra since \\"Tommy,\\" and in some ways better.  There is no filler material in the Green Day record, and you can pick up chicks easier listening to it (: <br /> <br />The mixing is strong (we could use a bit more bass guitar in parts), and the drum tuning, guitar tone, and vocals are excellent.  I'm not exaggarating when I say you need to hear this record.  It is a cohesive masterpiece that never really loses its intensity.  The 4 tracks that have gotten radio play cannot convey the strength of the album.  You must listen to the record.
0743537009|3.0|The Shining was the first Stephen King Book I ever read. It kept me up nights turning pages and scared me to death. It is still my favorite King book and I have re-read it many times. So I am sure you can imagine my excitement when I heard that they were finally going to release an audio version.  <br /> <br />I am sorry to say that this reading does not begin to do the story justice. I found Mr. Scott's interpretation flat and uninspired.   Most of the story is read in an almost monotone voice making one of the scariest books I have ever read a cure for insomnia. What also falls flat is Mr. Scott's attempt to create distinct voices for the characters. None sound convincing and I found the voice he used for Tony almost annoying. Thankfully Tony does not have a large speaking part in the book. They would have done much better to get Steven Weber who starred in the mini series to read.  <br /> <br />It really is a shame they did not pull out all the stops for the audio version, especially since this really is a one-time shot. There will be no re-recording of The Shining. If you must have an audio version of the book this is it. Too bad.
0060764864|4.0|The thing about audio books is the reader, who can make or break the aural experience.  Cherry Jones makes what would otherwise be a dated novel come alive.  Her ability to portray multiple characters of both genders is astonishing.
0380820846|5.0|My oh my... after finishing the *excellent* \\"The Viscount Who Loved Me\\" I really didn't think that JQ can do any better than that. But she does. I can't quite make up my mind as to which of the two is better! <br /> <br />This is the story of love come true ever after. Penelope Featherington has loved Colin Bridgerton for more than 10 years. Alas, she is not the kind of girl who attracts his kind of man, she being of the sort who nobody notices, and he being quite the opposite. So she is quite resigned to keeping her feelings to herself and remaining \\"on-the-shelf\\" at the ripe age of 28.  <br /> <br />But something happens. They have always been friends, but no Colin discovers, to his utter amazement, that there is more to the ugly duckling than meets the eye. She is funny and perceptive, and kind hearted. And while he wonders how come that nobody else sees this in her, he finds himself quite entangled with her. <br /> <br />While Colin is not exactly my sort of hero - I always go for the \\"dark, brooding type\\" :), Penelope is my perfect heroine. Perhaps because I can easily identify and symphatize with her. I always thought it unfair that only the most beautiful girls get to be heroines. I always felt that a true hero should see what the others do not, and Colin does this, so this redeems him completely in my eyes.  <br /> <br />And Penelope, the eternal spinster, the wallflower, truly gets her revenge on society in a most satisfactory manner. <br /> <br />It is also very nice that this is not \\"love at first sight\\"; instead, the two of them are friend before anything else, and they really get to *know* each other before they fall in love. And it's also very nice that the two of them have many things in common and are not bound only by physical attraction (these arguments are also valid for \\"The Viscount Who Loved Me\\"...). <br /> <br />Oh, and I LOVE Lady Danbury. She is great. She is the one who eventually gives Penelope confidence in herself. I'm so glad that JQ decided to make her more of a central character in this book! <br /> <br />The final ball scene is among one of the best I have ever read. I could hardly keep reading, I was so excited what was going to happen next - kind of like Lizzy in reading Darcy's letter in P&P, which JQ is apparently so fond of, since there are several references to \\"young men of large fortune\\" in her books. <br /> <br />This book is wittier and funnier than \\"The Viscount Who Loved Me\\" and just as good. I can't wait to move on to Eloise's story!  <br />
B00005JLEJ|4.0|Believe it or not, even though the film is 180 minutes, I was hoping it would just keep going.  Kagemusha is such a depressing movie, but it's also so good!  The only problem (which the commentators note) is the music as it's too \\"Hollywood\\" for the setting of the movie.  But that's a minor point.  I've enjoyed everything by Kurosawa and Kagemusha is one of the better films.  Of his later colour samurai films, if you had to choose between Ran and Kagemusha, Ran is by far the superior film - and from what I've read Kurosawa would agree. <br /> <br />Still, the extras make this package extra nice.  And just so you know, the essay by Donald Richie is not the same as the one in Mr. Richie's book on Kurosawa (also available on Amazon).  So once again, Criterion delivers an exceptional package!
B0002XDODU|3.0|Rammstein had a hard album to follow up after Mutter but whilst the tracks on this 2004 onslaught are not up to the apogee of some of the tracks on Mutter, this album isn't bad, but maybe could be described as just half an album.  Favourite tracks have to be America and Moscow, America's lyrics are amusing.  But some of the other tracks do sound like fillers, and I find you just end up skipping them.
B00006AUIG|5.0|If you are looking for a horror flick that is sitting in an obscure and dusty section of your local video store, grab a copy of Session 9.  While David Caruso's acting is typically over the top, the story and soundtrack (which is absolutely perfect for this movie, much as the somewhat similar The Shining) and the other actors carry this movie.  It is one of the best horror films you've never heard of.  Trust me, I have spent more time trolling the aisles for good (if unheard of) horror and thrillers and more often than not it is miss and not hit.  This one is worth your while.<br /><br />Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.  So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for...  This is especially true in the case of Session 9 - any plot tips or hints can really ruin this one for you.
B00006RINF|5.0|This album is excellent.  The songs are well written, the singing is good and unlike that crap band Nightwish (which I just cannot stand), the lyrics actually make some sense.  I am looking forward to Lacuna's next record.  They are definitely one of the best metal bands around at this moment of time.

B00005JNTX|4.0|Sin City was an amazing film, first off. <br />It's a wild, dark, over-the-top brain-buster of a thrill ride, an exciting, visually innovative film that left me gasping and raises comic-book films to a new level of artwork. <br />So why the lousy release? <br />Rodriguez is renowned for DVD extras- The ten-minute schools and other good stuff. But this DVD contains nothing other than a seven-minute featurette. No commentary or anything. <br />Buy this DVD, as the film is worth seeing many, many times. But, if you're strapped for cash, wait for the special edition. This disc contains an incredible film, but that's about it.
B0000025F7|5.0|Man, anytime I hear the opening string riff of \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\\", I am instantly transported back to the fall of my freshman year of college, and hearing that blasting out of dorm windows all across my little small-town campus.  I had a massive crush on Michael right from the git-go of the Jackson Five days (does anybody else remember those cheesy Saturday morning cartoons of the Jacksons, complete with a pair of funky mice for Michael?), and this was the album that proved that Michael was not just a cute kid, he was a brilliantly talented songwriter as well as an inspired all-around solo performer. I danced my ever-lovin' booty off to this album, under sparkling mirrored disco balls in clubs, in overcrowded dorm rooms, heck, even while doing laundry on a Sunday night, with a big old boom box blasting my cassette copy.  \\"Rock With You\\" is also one of the very first \\"videos\\" I remember, as MTV was exploding onto the music world. Everything about this album is perfect pop music craft, which I have never felt was an insult. After all, isn't \\"pop\\"-ular what many artists strive for?  Otherwise, they are just performing for themselves, so why record it in the first place?? Quincy Jones is the epitome of musicality and vision.  I cannot imagine a more inspired teaming of talents.  I wore out my cassette, and have purchased this on CD so that I can continue to dance with Michael and remember when he was younger, when his smile seemed more genuine, and the party was just getting started.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins explores the origin of the Dark Knight. Because of his parents' murder, Bruce Wayne embarks on a journey to find someone who will bring peace and justice to Gotham City. Bruce finds someone who is strong, fearful, and has a cool car: Batman. <br /> <br />Starting from how and why Bruce Wayne fears bats to Bruce becoming what he fears, Batman Begins is, in my opinion, the best superhero movie ever. Christian Bale played the perfect Batman, showing leadership and fear like the character should be. When I saw Christian Bale in the batsuit, I thought \\"Now that is Batman\\".  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this movie for you to buy. If you're not a Batman fan, this movie will turn you into one. <br />     <br />
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This is a very enjoyable album. My daughter & son in law had seen him at the Borgata Casino earlier this year and raved about his show and how great he was as a singer and performer. Their praise for his singing and personality led me here and now I can appreciate their feelings! It is so nice to hear the this style of music being rediscovered and done so well. The orchestration and musical arrangements are second to none as well. In my opinion Mr. Buble is darn talented and a joy to hear.
B0009YA386|4.0|'editors?' fortunately what editors (no article 'the') lack in a quality band name, they more than make up for on their debut album.<br /><br />one of the few bands to actually produce something worthwhile in this whole questionable 'nu wave revival,' editors pack a lot more emotional wallop than nu-wave wannabes like the bravery and the killers. and editors, unlike the bravery and the killers, actually understand what it means to write a decent song. while a lot of the songs do sound reasonably similar, none of the songs come off sounding repetitive. the album is full of great basslines, jackhammer drumming, and kaleidascopic guitars.<br /><br />tom's vocals are deceptively sincere and heartfelt, in a mortician sort of way. that's not to say, however, that he can't carry a melody, because he sure can--insert comparisons to paul banks, ian mcculloch and yes, ian curtis, here.<br /><br />vocal queue's aside, editors really know how to write a top notch tune. 'munich' (the best track on the album, in my opinion) is a corker -- swirling guitars, deadpan (but sincere)vocals, soaring chorus and the great line 'with one hand you calm me, with one hand i'm still' and another great line 'people are fragile things you should know by now, be careful what you put them through.' it's one of the year's top singles and should get the band noticed on this side of the pond. *should* being the proverbial operative word.<br /><br />'back room' is a promising debut and hopefully a sign of things to come: great vocals and lyrics, infectious hooks, solid musicianship. like most decent bands coming out of the UK, editors will, unfortunately, most likely go unnoticed outside snobby indie music circles. but when tom pronounces an edict like 'you'll speak when your spoken to' on 'munich,' one gets the feeling editors will tell YOU when to listen.
0385486804|5.0|I learned about this book while on a trip to Alaska recently. Our pilot on an 8-seater flight around Mt. McKinley (Denali to the locals)told us about it and then amazingly flew us low over the river and bus that are an integral part of the book's story. Afterwards, I bought a copy of the book in Anchorage, and as I read it, I could remember seeing where many of the events took place, even the spots in and near Healy, Alaska, where our flight originated and ended. The visual memories really breathed life into the tale, but even without having seen the sites, the book is an amazing read. Highly recommended.
B00008ADPF|5.0|I never much listen to the radio because I own tons of CD's but I heard one song by Nickelback and liked it so I went to my collection and found that I owned thier first CD and I really liked that and so I had to buy this one. I love this album, they have matured alot. Anyway I reccommend it. Give it a listen.
B0009P42S2|2.0|First, let me say that this movie has some of the most beautiful art and animation I have ever witnessed in a motion picture. The creativity and skill required to create such a visual masterpiece is beyond my imagining. And the idea to place the story in a slightly fantastic version of Victorian England was sheer genius. In visual terms, this movie is a Masterpiece with some of the most fantastic and beautiful imagery I've seen in a movie in a long, long time. <br /> <br />On the other hand the needlessly confusing, nearly non-existant plot cripples this movies' appeal from the very beginning. I could've dreamed up a better plot in five minutes, as could nearly anyone who watches this empty promise of a film.  <br /> <br />Many Anime films suffer from weak or overly convoluted plots, yet still manage to be entertaining thanks to a cast of interesting characters. But the characters in \\"Steamboy\\" seem almost like afterthoughts. The main protagonist (Ray) spends the entire picture rushing about filled with exasperation and worry. His father has no personality to speak of, and his grandfather, much like Ray, is a character without depth, his only job in the film being to sabotage the work of his son. A philosophical conflict between the grandfather and the father is highlighted throughout the movie, but never goes anywhere.  <br /> <br />In fact, among all the characters in \\"Steamboy\\" only \\"Miss Scarlett\\" has any potential, but her character is too contrived and implausible to be believable. Besides, her only job in the film is to hang around Ray, deliver the occasional cute line, and get in trouble. One keeps waiting for a single moment of character development to occur between her and Ray (Steamboy), especially since she starts inexplicably following him around from the moment they meet, but nothing ever develops.  <br /> <br />For that matter, the only character development of any sort that happens at any time during the film is a last-minute reconciliation between the father and grandfather that occurs for no discernable reason. <br /> <br />As a huge Anime fan I can't say enough how disappointed I was in \\"Steamboy\\", especially since the incredible visuals and fascinating setting gave it such incredible potential. Rent it if you must, but whatever you do don't buy this DVD without seeing it first! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JMAH|5.0|Wonderful movie, I love all of the special effects and the relationships that continue throughout the series.
0393312836|5.0|I knew about this book way before I actually went out and bought it (of course there was a gap between buying it and reading it, but that's another, utterly irrelevant, story), being aware of most of the basic facts about it, the general plot and so forth.  I've never seen the movie, although I've heard it's rather ultraviolent, which seems to be appropriate.  The thing that both attracted me and made me shy away from the novel though was the prose itself . . . for those who aren't already aware, Burgess sprinkles the novel liberally with a made-up slang that the main character uses.  I had seen a few pages at my local library and thought, \\"Crap, this isn't going to make any sense to me at all\\".  But it does, somehow.  There might actually be some editions floating out there with a glossary of sorts, giving you a clue as to what the more obscure slang terms might mean but you don't really need it.  Reading the novel, it's very easy to figure out what's going on and the text isn't impenetrable at all.  Most of the slang you can figure out via context and for the linguistically agile among you, I believe most of it is derived from Russian, mixed with some Britishisms and other stuff that I'm not smart enough to figure out.  The end result of this is that it gives the book a weird sort of driving rhythm, half the words seem made up but it flows anyway and I never had any trouble figuring out what was going on at any given point (not that you don't have to read carefully, but it's not Finnegans Wake or anything).  So that's that.  But what is it about?  The story is narrated by Alex, a teenager who inhabits a future Britain that has fallen into dingy decay, gangs walk the streets at night committing all sorts of violent acts, there hardly seems to be any hope and the government has become rather oppressive.  But Alex doesn't care because he's quite enjoying himself.  The book is a lot funnier than you might think and the violence (it's ample but not graphic) is almost slapstick.  Alex and his pals spend the first third of the book (it details a typical night) basically walking around and beating up everyone they see, the narration makes it clear that Alex is intelligent enough to know what he's doing but he likes it and would like to keep doing it.  One incident lands him in prison and while there and serving a long sentence, he's given a chance to get out early.  All he has to do is submit to a new procedure that will make him nonviolent and he can go back into society.  That procedure and its consequences drive the rest of the book, showing how things can seem to get better while actually getting worse.  It's a testament to Burgess' skill that he manages to make Alex a nearly sympathetic character, to the point where I started to feel bad for him, especially in the scenes where he's denied the joy of his beloved classical music.  The moral dilemma he poses is an interesting one, questioning whether society really becomes better if you take away free will.  The edition I have (and most recent editions, I'm sure) restores the previously \\"lost\\" final chapter . . . it was cut from the American edition for various reasons and it and the actual final chapter end the story on two utterly different notes.  I prefer the real final chapter, I think it closes the book on a reflective note, rather than the implied middle finger of the prior chapter, and I think it's more faithful to Burgess' intent.  But your milage may vary and if you really disagree just stop before you get to the end.  I don't know if it's the best Burgess book but it's certainly the most famous and quite the reading experience for those who prefer more experimental prose styles.  It was published forty years ago but still feels contemporary and it certainly worth reading even today, in a future that Burgress might not have imagined but may be closer to his than we suspect.lapstick.

B00009QI29|5.0|There is nothing better than chilling out to this awesome CD.  The Russian pop duo hit it big with a lot of people with these catchy tunes and lyrics.  I was turned onto their music during their American debut, and now I own seven or eight of their Cds and am impatiently awaiting Dangerous and Moving's arrival in October 05.  This cd is great for people who want a good mix of t.A.T.y's range.  There are upbeat, powerful songs like Not Gonna Get Us that make you want to get up and pump your fist in the air, and sweet songs like All The Things She Said that will make you want to hold your significant other.  If you want to truly appreciate the girls' talent, listen to their russian songs as well.  This CD carries two of them, but there are plenty more; some don't have english versions, and they are all amazing!
B000003BF1|2.0|OK, When I pressed play I was expecting to hear a rock masterpeice as so many have put it... however what I heard was anything but a masterpeice. The songs are... how should I put this... boring. The songs are boring and that is all there is to it. I like classic rock, but I didn't expect a boring country album. Being a Stones album I expected there to be plenty of country elements, but this is just a country album. Its not rock. Frankly, If you are a country fan I am sure you will enjoy it, but if you are looking for an interesting rock album, don't buy this. Its really not too impressive. I give it 2.5 stars for good lyrics and guitar playing, which I do respect this album for.    ok I will admit.. Gimme Shelter is a good song.
B00005Y7LD|5.0|I've owned this CD for years - and I never get sick and tired of it. <br /> <br />On the contrare. During home parties, my friends ask me - who's that on the stereo? I say, Billy Idol, man. You like it? <br /> <br />And they always say - That rocks! <br /> <br />Nuff said.
B000002GJH|5.0|All I will say is that \\"Say Hello 2 Heaven\\" Is the single greatest vocal perfomance in the history of rock. When you hear Chris Cornell blast out with shaddering emotion on this track, you will be blown away, just like I was. Eddie Vedder, another great singer, also appears throughout the album, adding beutiful harmony. \\"Say Hello 2 Heaven\\" is indeed the single best vocal performance in the history of rock, and is reason alone to purchase this CD. Overall, most of the songs are good, and the album is one of the most underrated of all time.
B000002LND|5.0|Madonna Ciccone, who single handedly reformed the whole image of pop music. If you ever listen to one CD of the pop icon, then The Immaculate Collection is the best choice. Featuring chart stopping single from her early pre-1990 reign, Madonna is Like a Virgin while dissing pop culture with Material Girl, while all the while you are listening to cult hits that seem to have the name Madonna emblazoned on them. <br />A must buy for anyone with a CD player, and for Madonna lovers, well, there's no use telling them, since they would already have this...
B00003CWNR|5.0|You probably have read at least one sypnosis by now so i'll just get into the review: <br /> <br />One of the most intruiging aspects of this film is the absolutely gorgeous setting. The visuals in pretty much every seen were beautiful. I would recommend seeing this movie if not for the excellent acting or craftmanship but at least for the breathtaking backgrounds. <br /> <br />I found Michael Caine to be near perfect as Dr. Wilbur Larch, he definitely deserves his Oscar. Tobey Maguire was very good as Homer Wells and better in this role than in any other I have seen. I sometimes feel as if Paul Rudd doesn't get enough credit for his consistantly excellent acting, he was amazing and even scene stealing as Lieutenant Wally Worthington. I do enjoy watching Charlize Theron but I was only mildly disappointed in her portrayal of Candy Kendall....she is a lot better in \\"Monster\\". Delroy Lindo really brought to life Mr. Rose - the good and the bad of him. Eryka Bahdu really exceeded my expectations as Rose Rose and should be noted for this role. All of the supporting characters were well played and the child actors in this movie are unusually good and I enjoyed watching that little kid from Malcolm in the Middle as Fuzzy. <br /> <br />So all in all I'd recommend this movie to everyone to watch at some point in their lives to view something special amongst all the very poorly made Hollywood films out there.
B000002UVX|5.0|Let me start by saying that I consider this album a must have for not only Jimi Hendrix fans, but rock music lovers. Though you might still find a few people that will contest Jimi's creative greatness and influence, you won't find many and this remarkable album illustrates why. I have often believed that truly great artists exhibit a common quality. Not only do they create and introduce us to new sounds, sights, and feelings, but they do it again and again, evolving through one new paradigm after another. Jimi was this and more. He was the fountain head of so much of what we have found in music since the 1960's. If you listen to the unfortunately scant catalog of albums actually released during his life in chronological order, you will hear an incredible evolution of styles, each of which had never been heard before and each of which has been embraced and emulated by band after band ever since. Whole careers have been built around emulating just one of Jimi's many sounds (e.g., Robin Trower). <br /> <br />Then, just as The Experience starts fades away, leaving us with a legacy that by any standard would still merit greatness, Jimi blasts his way through Woodstock with new band mates, finally landing on his feet with The Band of Gypsys. Thus we are introduced to yet another new and amazing sound, one that unfortunately did not have nearly enough time to grow and flourish. I believe The Band of Gypsys created a sound that has not been heard again since. I hear many reviewers talk about the \\"funk\\" of this album, and to be honest, I am a little mystified by this. To me characterizing this album as funk rock is like characterizing the Album Brothers as a garage band. The music on this album is beyond funk, beyond rock, beyond blues, and, in fact, beyond anything we had heard before or have heard since. 30 seconds of \\"Who Knows\\" and you will know what I am talking about. What this music represented was the next great step in the evolution of rock music, taking elements of blues, acid rock, jazz, and funk (with less funk than any other element I would say), mixing them with something that was uniquely Jimi, and fusing all this into a new art form. Yes, for me this album is THAT powerful.  <br /> <br />Band of Gypsys represents a path in musical evolution that was hijacked by the music industry so they could return us to to the pre-packaged, demographically driven crap that filled the void between the great era of the swing band and the emergence of true rock and roll, when the studios told the musicians what to play and how to play it. With the light of Jimi and a few other key artists gone, the music industry took us right back into the abyss courtesy of the the plastic world of disco. Then they led us by our wallets right into into the modern era of the \\"focus-group-tested\\" pablum of the Back Street Boys and Brittany Spears. Once again, the \\"suits\\" and not the artists control the content which means creativity is dead. Long live AOR. (Hip hop was a brief exception to this, but, honestly, I am not a hip hop fan and even hip hop is losing it's luster as a creative art form as the studios package it more and more). <br /> <br />Band of Gypsys was the evolutionary path music SHOULD have followed but didn't because the strain of trying to carry us to better place ultimately destroyed it's leaders. I hope you are in a better place now, Jimi, because every time I listen to your music, I know I am. <br /> <br />If you really love creative music and freedom of musical expression buy this album. You will not regret it. What you will regret is that no one is making this kind of music anymore.
B0001MDP3G|2.0|dudes, look, we know what the civial war was a about, like, blood, battles (i'm not knockin the battles in this movie, the first 10 mninutes was great blowin  up the bullwerks at vicksburg, or wehrever the heck it was.)  but, dudes, things were not all immoral and sh**, with people rapin people in the forest, and the movie was too plotty and lyrical at the same time, like a bad vamp -- and the austrailian girl was way too useless and weak for bein a city girl, OR a counrty girl.  and the moment that cheesed my grits most was when the townee evil dudes stabbe the farmer dude, and crunch his wife's hands in the fnce (yeah, right), and... ready for this... AMBUSHES THE WAR VET SONS WHO ARE HIDING LIKE PU**IES IN THE BACK -- NO FREAKIN WAY WOOD CIVIL WAR VETS BE SCARED OF NO TOWNEE.  THEY WOULDA FREEKIN KICKED SUM TOWNEE A**.  CIVEL WAR VETS ARE BADD-A**.  civil war killed 1 in 12 of the US population, so next time a brit wants to make a historical melodrama out of the greatest moment in our countryes history, we should let larry david do a crappy add-libbed reality series about the Quenn Mother.  also, makin bad civil war movies like this make sit harder for good ones to get made.  vets represent!  i'm out.  j.
B000002J1S|5.0|I first heard this album about five or six years ago when I was just getting into music as an actual listener and player instead of someone who uses it as background noise.  I was listening mostly to U2, the Indigo Girls, The Grateful Dead, Elton John, and so on, all of which are incredibly good artists and bands, and all of which really spurred me onward in my quest to hear more and more great music.  My dad has hundreds of CDs, tapes, and old records, and one day, when we were clearing out the garage, he decided to put \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\" into the CD player.  All I can say is that I was blown away.  Literally.  And again when the second track started.  And again when the third track started, and so on.  And then he put in THE SECOND DISC!!!  Other than maybe \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" by Pink Floyd, \\"Lamb\\" was the most absolutely gorgeous album I had heard at the time.  Up until this point, all the music I had listened to had been beautiful and stirring and inspirational, but Genesis were something else to me.  It was like I was experiencing every possible emotion I had at the same time.  For 90 minutes.  From the soaring, interplayed electric and acoustic guitars and bass to the stunning drumming to the evocative and moving keyboard and piano lines all the way up to Peter Gabriel's fantastically emotive and wrenching vocals . . . everything about it reached down and plucked at my soul. <br /> <br />Years later, after having spent the vast majority of what was supposed to be my college spending money on CDs (including purchasing my own copy of this album), all I can really say is that \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\" is one of the greatest pieces of music ever.  I still melt down every time I hear \\"In the Rapids\\" and the segue into \\"it\\"; there's something about those two songs that just . . . wow.  Even now, as I try, with some difficulty, to develop my own playing ability and style (for bass guitar, specifically), I hear echoes of Genesis in my head, constantly pushing for emotion and innovation and beauty.  Anyone who enjoys music . . . at all . . . should own this album.  It is beautiful.

B00006FM77|5.0|The wait is finally over. Chicago's legendary four-album document of their sold-out week at Carnegie Hall is at last, reissued and remastered. In addition to the material that was included on the original 1971 album, there is a complete disc of unreleased material from the concerts as well as the original packaging and replicas of the original posters and booklet which came with the LP. Granted, THIS is the ultimate reissue of this classic live album.<br /><br />As for the music itself, it is full of the raw energy that made Chicago so great during its early days. Instead of the short snappy pop songs and romantic ballads, you get extended jam-band cuts such as \\"In The Country\\", \\"South California Purples\\", \\"Sing A Mean Tune Kid\\" and \\"It Better End Soon\\". Additionally, there are stellar renditions of \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\" (complete with a six-minute 'Free Form Intro' from Mr. Chops, Robert Lamm), \\"Questions 67 and 68\\", \\"25 or 6 to 4\\", \\"Beginnings\\" and the band's plea for Nixon's resignation, \\"A Song For Richard and His Friends\\". All seven of Chicago's original band members are given due time in the spotlight and are full of the energy and vigour of an excited young band during their first shot of fame. Terry Kath's extended guitar solos on the aforementioned \\"Purples\\" and \\"Sing A Mean Tune Kid\\" are some of his best guitar solos on record full of freedom and endless invention.<br /><br />As for the bonus material, there are tunes which were not released on the original \\"Carnegie Hall\\" album as well as alternate performances of several tracks on the original album. The \\"Naseltones\\" free form intro included here is another Robert Lamm piano improvisation which goes into a boogie motiff that has a slight hint of Dave Brubeck in its groove. In addition, \\"Listen\\" and Terry Kath's \\"Hour In The Shower\\" are rock solid and are worthy additions to the original album.<br /><br />Hands down, this is an awesome trip down memory lane for those who were there to remember it, those who bought the album when it originally was released and those who discovered it years later and couldn't get enough of it. This is the early Chicago in their prime as they used to be.<br /><br />Hats off to Chicago and Rhino Records for such a stellar reissue of this classic concert.<br /><br />On a personal note: I saw Chicago in concert in 1991 and to be honest, they were absolutely horrible. It was the worst concert I've ever attended. This Carngegie Hall concert beats the heck out of that 1991 concert by a huge longshot.those who bought the album when it originally was released and those who discovered it years later and couldn't get enough of it.

B000A7S4B0|5.0|Forget Coldplay and the other mediocre bands on the charts. Howl puts their over-hyped, over-anticipated albums to SHAME. This the truest, richest, most honest album I've heard all year. After BRMC, I was a little confused by Take Them On, only because the songs seemd so disjointed from one another. But not with Howl. Each song flows into the next with a brilliant arrangement that makes this a disc you have to listen to in its entirety. Who cares if they've lost all their Jesus and Mary Chain distortion? This band has come into its own and they're simply wonderful. <br /> <br />And for the record, this band kicks ass live... <br />
B0000AFQS0|5.0|I wondered if it would EVER get to DVD, and now I don't have to wait any more.  I'm buying this as soon as I finish this review, and since I've seen the crux of this rockumentary already, coupled with having read all the reviews, I can say in advance, that The Who were not only the greatest band to come out of the sixties and/or seventies, but also the most underrated.  Their music had meaning and ferocity long before punk came along and declared that there was no other way.  They were the first punk band (and \\"the FIRST band to vomit in the bar\\"), and even The Clash (during their prime) covered The Who.  One of the best things about The Who is that, tribute bands aside, no one sounds like them.  Plenty sound like The Beatles or The Rolling Stones or (insert band of choice here), but The Who were/are unique, and no one did what they did the way they did it.  Keith Moon was a madman, unlike anyone else, before or since.  His style of back to front playing (a phrase I read John Entwistle use once) stands alone among rock drummers, and though he did deteriorate, he lived on his own terms, without apologies or remorse.  Entwistle was/is GOD among bass players.  I'm a bass player myself, and his playing never ceases to amaze me.  He played lead while Townshend played rhythm, unheard of for a rock band (esp. back then).  As for Townshend, what else can be said???  I love him for the power he brought to his live performances, and for his simple yet powerful and melodic playing.  His songs are still under-appreciated, touching on themes of gender identity, masturbation, alienation, angst, anger, political commentary, and more, long before it became fashionable or acceptable.  He wasn't Dylan, but Dylan never smashed a guitar onstage and told everyone to \\"FU#$ OFF!\\" now did he???  As for Roger Daltrey, he might be the MOST under-appreciated of The Who.  In his prime, he had more power, presence, range, and feeling than Lennon, McCartney, Jagger, et al. combined.  AND, HE DIDIT WITH SONGS HE DIDN'T EVEN WRITE!!!  He brought life to Pete's songs that Pete's voice could not.  Props to Pete for recognizing that early on...  I know I'll love this DVD, even before actually watching it.  Finally, I think it's a shame that Pete and Roger continue to tour.  Going on without Keith was bad enough, but touring as 'The Who' without John is insulting.  It's not The Who without Keith and John, so the reviewer who said they've become their own tribute band is not that far off.  However, that said, what they accomplished in their prime can't be changed (Thank God!), so their legacy (of what they did in their prime) is intact, no matter what.  Personally, I don't want to see them performing at 60 and beyond--it's not what rock and roll is about.  Truth be told, them performing in their 40s and 50s is almost as absurd.  Kurt Cobain once said that he thought it was ridiculous for them (Roger, Pete, and John) to tour in their 40s-that they couldn't possibly do what they did when they were in their 20s.  13 years after Kurt said that, I have to say I agree.  On the other hand, what the hell else would they do???  Be rust repairers???
B00004RFFS|5.0|I am so proud. I saw this movie years ago, but recently watched it again and it took me back 13 years, to when I was 16 and madly infatuated with Lestat. A breeze would blow open my curtain at night and I would stiffen thinking it would reveal Lestat in my window, to which I would say, \\"Please...go\\" and he would respond, \\"But you've been calling me for some time, my love.\\" Sounds irresponsible to me now that I'm 29 and haven't visted the Vampire Chronicles in a long time. Sounds young and childish to a flaw. However, when I first heard about this movie I was enraged that Tom Cruise and BRAD PITT were playing the leading roles! WHAT? I blanched. I mean, come on, aren't they just too pretty? However, when I began to see pictures of what they made Tom Cruise look like for the role, I was taken aback. \\"That IS Lestat,\\" I thought. And Pitt is not so pretty, but his frail figure was perfect for Louis. I had to admit I did the same thing when I found out Lucas had digitally altered the Star Wars Trilogy, but then again, who am I? He's the author. And so, when I read that Anne had overseen this and was pleased, I thought...well, who am I? If one the greatest and enthralling authors of all time says she likes what Hollywood has done to her book, then I must trust, right? <br />So, I loved it. I will always love it, I'm sure. Antonio was eloquent and just as hard and uncaring as the book portrayed his character, Santiago. Oh, and beautiful Claudia...could Kirsten Dunst been out performed by anyone? She really did a fantastic job.  <br />I couldn't be more pleased.
B000A7S4B0|3.0|This album is not what I expected.  I don't think it's what anyone who was previously familiar with BRMC was expecting.  I don't hate it, but I certainly don't love it.  It is still in a style that I can enjoy and appreciate, but I want my old BRMC back.  Progression and evolution are good things, but this is a bit much.  Weight of the World isn't too far from their previous incarnation, so I guess I'd say it is the best track on here.  Caveat Emptor!
B00005A0V0|4.0|Originally released in 1971, this was the band's third album. 'In The Land Of Grey & Pink' is only the second release by Caravan I've ever had. Didn't exactly thrill my gorilla, but I was somewhat impressed with the band's style, charm and conviction. Caravan DOES indeed have their own 'style'... cannot think of another word to describe it; of playing and writing top quality progressive / Canterbury pieces. Tunes I enjoyed the most were \\"Winter Wine\\", the twenty-two minute epic \\"Nine Feet\\" and the whimsical \\"Golf Girl\\". Decca had tagged on five (5) bonus tracks to make this title even more so desirable. Might appeal to fans of Hatfield & The North, Gentle Giant, Camel, Barclay James Harvest and Renaissance.
B000000W6F|5.0|Much has been written about Nirvana's classic \\"Nevermind\\" and how it changed the musical landscape, not just at the time, but forever. Most of it is true, but what a lot of people fail to recognize is that Nirvana were just one of many bands at the time, part of a movement. One of the groups that wouldn't really acheive true success until later, The Smashing Pumpkins, were also breaking new ground, and despite being located in Chicago, they definitely fit in among the Seattle scene while still bringing their own style to the table. On their debut album, \\"Gish,\\" Smashing Pumpkins are presented at their rawest, most rocking, thanks in part to legendary producer Butch Vig (who also did \\"Nevermind\\") and to Smashing Pumpkins mastermind, Billy Corgan, who as the group's career would progress, would prove to be a true visionary, ahead of the times. Even if you couldn't get past his nasal whine.<br /><br />No doubt, \\"Gish\\" is the only Smashing Pumpkins album (out of 5) that you can truly classify as grunge. However, what set Smashing Pumpkins apart (at least at this point in time) was Corgan's unique, and somewhat vague songwriting, coupled with excellent musicianship that often gave way to some rather creative jams. This ten song album is split into it's soft sides, and it's rough sides. The grungy, riffy \\"I Am One,\\" \\"Tristessa\\" and \\"Siva,\\" which are 90's essentials in themselves, are backed up by some truly memorable, lighter fare, such as \\"Bury Me,\\" \\"Crush\\" and the epic \\"Rhinoceros.\\" Despite being easily their most streamlined and direct affair, there were still signs of what was to come on future albums, as noted by \\"Snail\\" and the mellow closing number, \\"Daydream,\\" which features bassist D'Arcy on vocals.<br /><br />Despite being just a mere ten tracks wide, \\"Gish\\" is still a very substantial, versatile listen. It definitely smells of the 90's, and as a sign of the times, Corgan had long, flowing hair. When you consider the now iconic image of Billy's pasty, bald, white visage, the picture of Corgan included in the liner notes really gives you an idea of where the band were at the beginning of their career. As time went on, and as they reached even bigger success, they evolved, and they ended up very far from where they started. But one thing you can never accuse the Pumpkins of is being boring, and never doing the same thing twice. And \\"Gish\\" is a testament to that. A brief glimpse at the group as just a straight-forward rock band, and definitely the best in their league., white visage, the picture of Corgan included in the liner notes really gives you an idea of where the band were at the beginning of their career.

B000929AJQ|5.0|From start to finish this album is amazingly consistent, I can go through it without ever feeling the need to skip any of it. That is the first time I have ever been able to say that about a NIN release. Before With Teeth my favourite work of Reznor's was Pretty Hate Machine, with his Still release coming in second. I honestly found both The Fragile and The Downward Spiral lost momentum at times. The Fragile seemed to offer so much on the surface for me, but the more and more I listened the less interesting I found it. Once I had discovered everything I could within it, it felt like it could offer me nothing more. Trent seemed to place creating soundscapes in-front of crafting songs. I'm not saying it wasn't good, I just felt some moments could have been left behind. <br /> <br />If that was my problem with The Fragile this album is the antidote. The song craft comes first, bare bones almost, the production noticably emptier that other NIN releases. However, don't believe the hype there is still a lot here to take in. It's just presented in a more direct fashion.  <br /> <br />The album begins with the absolute killer \\"All The Love In The World\\" a plodding drum and bass influenced piece that is amazingly atmospheric - and to everybody that has ever said a bad word about trents singing check out his falsetto at the end. Other highlights for me are \\"With Teeth\\" - though some absolutely hate the chorus I can't get enough of it, a pump your fist moment for me. \\"You Know What You Are\\" - check for the insane drumming and the stunning keyboard interlude, \\"The Line Begins To Blur\\" a very melodic and floaty chorus make this song, I love those two subtle piano notes he hits during it. \\"Beside you In Time\\" - a slow build up song, a keyboardists paradise - it's like an ascent into euphoria, great singing from Trent once again.  <br /> <br />With Teeth is another great addition to the NIN catalogue that should cement Trent has one of the most vital artists of the last twenty years.
B00005JMX6|5.0|At face value, this movie seems like the typical teen sex romp ala \\"American Pie\\".  But after watching this movie, I found that this teen flick really has heart.  And despite the movie's farfetched plotline and trite plot developments, I thought that this movie accomplished what few other teen comedies have: a balance between the grossly funny and the sentimental.  A definite BUY for everyone  both in and out of high school.  Yes, this is a teen flick, but it's one that goes beyond the obvious and cuts to the heart of being a teenager.
B00006690G|5.0|he aint dat bad but eventually the songs get reall boring . when he comes out its really good but eventually gets boring maybe its not my type of music. chi town love
B0002OERI0|4.0|I was never a huge fan a Green Day, they had some catchy songs and I enjoyed listening to them on a casual basis, never bought an album except for their hits.  I figured after they released International Superhits they were done, maybe do some benefit concerts or something like that, but no new stuff.  However, I was wrong.  I've always thought music should be like a story, have a point, and keep me interested.  Pink Floyd and The Who where famous for these this type of music... Concept albums, I believe they're known as.  A story or idea carried throughout an entire album.  While it may just be the themes of the songs, or maybe the same musical progression we hear at the beginning returns at the end.  In my mind The Wall is the most perfect example of this.  It shows a level a creativity not seen by all musical artists to do something like a concept album, and to do one well is even more amazing. <br /> <br />So now Green Day is back with whole new album.  Still punk rock... It's NOT punk and it's NOT rock, it's punk rock, so people who think they know what they're talking about calling Green Day punk, you have no idea.  However, instead of having a random assortment of power chords or mellow vocals they have put 2 dozen or so of these power chord driven, mellow vocal-ed songs into one large piece of music.  Sure, it's not a perfect concept album because there are breaks and not everything seems to make as much sense as it seems, but what they did do was bring they're version of music to a new level,  a level where talent meets inspiration.  This album is by no means a \\"sell-out\\" album.  If it was a sell-out then it would have come out 5 years ago.  Because some of the topics are now considered \\"90's\\" shows that the songs have been in development for some time and not written 2 weeks before its release. <br /> <br />It's important for bands to change they're style as they progress through their life span or else they get boring and run out of material.  If Led Zeppelin hadn't experimented every chance they got they wouldn't be seen as one of the best bands of all time today... Same with the Beatles, although to a lesser extent.  I cannot get over how people see this as such a massive departure from their older stuff... It's still very, very punk rock; it just has structure to it.  I guess songs that make general sense aren't as good as mindless yells and drawls?  But these people obviously don't know what real music sounds like anyway. <br /> <br />I have high hopes for their next album.  I hope they can clean up their new style enough to make it last a little longer.  This album, although great, got boring after about 5 or 6 listens.  I'm still not a huge punk rock fan, the lack of electric guitar talent really steers me away, but I do appreciate quality music and this IS quality music.
068485743X|3.0|There's a lot of good information in this book that you might not find on other \\"improve your writing\\" books. For example, the insight that editors and agents, when they're reading from the slush pile, really are looking for a reason--any reason--to reject what they're reading. The sooner they can determine that it's not good writing, the sooner they can dispense with it and get on to the next piece. Or the notion that badly written dialog can often be detected without even reading it. The layout of quotes on the pages can tell a reader that the writer is using too much or too little  dialog.<br /><br />Additionally, Lukeman goes over ground that's more familiar to anyone who has read books about writing or taken courses: \\"show rather than tell,\\" avoid first person narratives if you're a beginner, etc., etc. But these points too he looks at from the viewpoint of an editor and agent; what sorts of mistakes stand out most to this group of highly experienced and highly critical readers.<br /><br />However, I have one big complaint: The examples of bad writing that Lukeman uses. These examples are heavily sprinkled through the book; a paragraph or two of italicized text every few pages. Here's Lukeman's example of excessive use of adverbs and adjectives:<br />\\"The squad car went fast down the bumpy, rocky road, quickly swerving to avoid the large, fat bugs smashing squarely against the slimy windshield.\\"<br />And so on for two paragraphs, WITH ALL THE MODIFIERS UNDERLINED, just to make sure we don't miss the point. Now, I don't doubt that Lukeman, in his long career as an editor and literary agent, has seen examples of writing as bad as that. But I would be willing to bet real money that NO ONE who buys this book could possibly, ever, in a million years, write as badly as the examples Lukeman uses. If you've given enough thought to the craft of writing that you buy a book about it, then surely you've given it too much thought to be able to write that badly.<br /><br />If Lukeman has seen actual writing as bad as that (poor guy!), the reason is that there are people in the world who have given no thought whatsoever to the craft of writing, but who still think they can write.<br /><br />The result is that the examples in this book aren't instructive; they're just silly and insulting. After the first couple, you'll be sputtering in exasperation at the book.<br /><br />Another, related complaint is that these negative examples are almost the only writing examples that Lukeman gives us. This is in keeping with the stated goal of the book; to show writers how to avoid common mistakes. But it left me thinking wistfully about other how-to-write books I've read, like Janet Burroway's [[ASIN:0205750346 Writing Fiction: A Guide to Narrative Craft]],  which offers its readers many wonderful examples of beautiful writing by various authors, each selection chosen to illustrate a particular point the book is making.<br /><br />Bottom line: I recommend this book, but as you value your life or your reason, keep away from the italicized passages!ting as bad as that (poor guy!), the reason is that there are people in the world who have given no thought whatsoever to the craft of writing, but who still think they can write.

B0007Y08QA|5.0|I have long admired Christian Bale as an actor ever since I saw him in Empire of The Sun. I think this movie is by far the pinnacle of his career. This is a thinking person's psychological thriller. When I realized it was directed by Brad Anderson, I just knew I wouldn't be disappointed. (His Session 9 is another masterpiece.) There are so many symbols and allusions in the film that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. In fact, I had to watch the film a couple of times. I wasn't surprised to see it was filmed in Spain. Somehow films made with European collaborators have more texture and meat on their bones (even if poor Trevor didn't have any on his). Anyone who was disappointed in it, just didn't get it. Christian Bale rules as far as I'm concerned!! The extra scenes in the DVD were nice to have if only because they just added a little more detail.

B00080ZG10|4.0|It ain't always easy being a visionary and an innovative genius - just ask Howard Hughes, the renowned millionaire, who had three main ambitions in life: to build the fastest airplanes, to make the biggest movies, and to become the richest man in the world.  That he achieved those lofty goals at a very great personal cost to himself is what makes his story the stuff of legend.  For Hughes also suffered from the demon of mental illness, which manifested itself in chronic obsessive/compulsive behavior, a neurotic fear of germs, and acute paranoia.  Martin Scorsese captures all facets of this larger-than-life figure in \\"The Aviator,\\" a high-flying epic that does justice to a man who became a national icon and the embodiment of the American dream despite his internal weaknesses - and whose legend lives on today.<br /><br />John Logan's script spends virtually no time on Hughes' youth except for a brief prologue which shows Howard's hypochondriac mother planting those seeds of fear in his tender psyche that would haunt him the rest of his life.  The story proper begins with Hughes' efforts to produce what would turn out to be the most expensive film ever made up to that time, the war epic \\"Hell's Angels,\\" a non-studio work that allowed Hughes to combine his twin loves of moviemaking and aviation.  If nothing else, Hughes thought BIG, and his capriciousness and profligacy, as reflected in the mounting budget of the film he was making, also spilled over into the realm of aviation, as he began looking for ways to create ever more aerodynamic airplanes at greater and greater cost.  His obsession with size culminated in the creation of the ill-fated Spruce Goose, the largest airplane ever made - and one whose airborne career lasted exactly one flight.<br /><br />Logan and Scorcese also focus on the personal side of Hughes' life, concentrating specifically on his tumultuous affairs with Katharine Hepburn (brilliantly played by Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale).  His relationship with Hepburn is a particularly telling one because they seem to understand one another so well - so well, in fact, that they are unable to make a permanent go of things and wind up going their separate ways.<br /><br />As director, Scorcese brings his usual flair and visual inventiveness to the film, soaring highest - as is appropriate, perhaps - in the aviation sequences.  The first hour, in particular, moves at a breathless clip, as he weaves the various strands of his epic - yet, at the same time, intimate - story into a cohesive whole.  If the truth be told, at 170 minutes, the movies does run a little too long and it sags a bit in its middle section.  However, as Hughes begins to unravel psychologically - at one point locking himself in a screening room barely clinging to what little remains of his sanity - the movie becomes a sad but fascinating study of a man in the throes of a nervous breakdown.  The scene in which Hepburn converses with Hughes through a locked door, pleading with him to let her come in and help him, is heartbreaking in its poignancy.<br /><br />As Hughes, Leonardo Di Caprio carries the weight of the film on his frail shoulders, and he does a superb job, hitting new dramatic heights in the scenes in which he both falls to pieces psychologically and rises confidently to the challenge of clearing his good name in a senate hearing.  Alan Alda is also terrific as the senator from Maine determined to get Hughes to sell TWA to Pan Am in order to achieve a monopoly on international flight carriers in the future.<br /><br />The first half of the 20th Century provided fertile soil for individuals like Hughes to grow and flourish, men with the brains to see what the future offered and the guts to reach out and go for it.  The film captures the era beautifully through the art deco architecture, the dazzling sets and costumes, and a nostalgia-evoking soundtrack overflowing with familiar period standards.<br /><br />What Scorcese undoubtedly understands is that Hughes continues to cast a spell over the general public not because of what he accomplished as a moviemaker, an inventor, an entrepreneur, but because he did all those things battling demons that made him both inexplicably strange and, at the same time, more recognizable as a human being with weaknesses very much like ourselves.  It is this paradox that creates the kind of mystery a figure needs if he is to remain a source of fascination long after his death.  In honor of that spirit, \\"The Aviator\\" doesn't unravel the enigma of Howard Hughes; it deepens it.

0790729652|5.0|This Batman movie is probably one of the best ones. Michael Keaton sure acted his best and I do believe, as my dad says, that Michael Keaton is the best Batman compared to the other 3. He really captures the spirit of batman. The movie was really fun for all.<br /><br />The basic Plot:<br />There's a new villain fighter in town, Batman. While he goes around fightin crime, The Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson) who becomes the Joker wants revenge on Batman for turning him into the green laughing freak. Of course, you'll know the ending is a good one when he falls off the building and ... dies, with a smile on his face.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson also pulled this one off with his wacky character. The fun spirit of Jack and his companions really rock the house down. Even when the situation is supposed to be tensed, Jack still continues to make the flow of the movie fun.<br />This movie is highlt recommended for families who like to get together for a relaxed time.<br /><br />Great!<br /><br />Kirstie Mabitad
B000274THQ|4.0|Who would have thought that not long after Ronald Reagan uttered those confrontational words, that the Berlin Wall would be breeched.  Many thought Mr. Reagan hopelessly naive for even questioning the status quo with regard to Berlin, but down it came, showing us once again how history sometimes is less evolutionary than subject to punctuated equilibrium.  Think of geological plate tectonics---ie., earthquakes & volcanoes.  The Berlin Wall was an anachronism (likewise the division of Germany).  We---in the West, at least---knew it had to eventually come down, but never expected it to do so until it did. \\"Goodbye, Lenin\\" doesn't address whether east Germans believed similarly or not, but it is grounded in the abruptness with which the Berlin Wall did fall.  And it captures the essence of such most effectively, and does so in such a unique manner.  Most of the film takes place AFTER the Berlin Wall has been breeched, but---at one and the same time---the story ingeniously provides us, ie., the viewers, a  window into the east BEFORE this dramatic development.  Mind you, save for one exception, it doesn't concern itself with the dark side of the German \\"Democratic\\" Republic, ie., secret police activities, informers within society, and the like.  (If you are interested in such, have a look at Timothy Garton Ash's book, \\"The File.\\" It's about how the Stasi security services kept tabs on this British journalist, as well as on millions of its own citizens.)  \\"Goodbye Lenin,\\" nonetheless, does give one a taste of East Berlin and that it does so in such a whimsical way makes for an entertaining film (the details of which I assume you have already familiarized yourself with above.) In addition, the acting herein is more than above average, and the direction is most able--in particular, a scene of a moving Lenin statue is accomplished with great effect; and is, to boot, hilarious.  (If you think Reagan was the incarnation of the devil & simply wish to register that view---although it has nothing to do with this film---then go ahead and ignore this well made film; otherwise do have a look at this film & do listen to the director's commentary on this DVD as well.  It will clue you in to a lot---after watching this film---that you didn't even know you missed, but did!) This is a 3 1/2 star film, but because of its historical interest, I'm rounding it up to 4 Stars.

B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Wolfgang Petersen's \\"Troy\\" bears all the hallmarks of a major studio production for a summer blockbuster.  Thousands of soldiers clash in violent battle scenes, plenty of beefcake and cheesecake to go around (but not too racy as to potentially offend anyone), famous and semi-famous actors even in marginal roles, and more than a bit of romance.  All this points to the good, but the problem is that in taking this perspective to the battle of Troy, Petersen and his team generally gutted the \\"Iliad,\\" which is only one of the foundations of the Western Canon and with plenty of devoted fans. <br /> <br />Brad Pitt's Achilles is the best example of how \\"Troy\\" fundamentally changed a major character.  Pitt's Achilles is no longer a semi-immortal, beloved of the Gods and vulnerable only in the heel that his mother held when she dipped him in the River Styx.  Instead, he's \\"just\\" the best warrior out there.  Pitt's Achilles is no longer the desperately vain hero of the \\"Iliad,\\" but instead is a thoughtful man given to internal anguish over things like loyalty, duty, and the like.  Also abandoned is Achilles' love for his friend Patroclus -- rather than touch upon any hint of homosexuality, the script makes Achilles and Patroclus cousins.  This doesn't quite work as justification for Achilles' rage after Patroclus' death -- as more than one Trojan points out to Achilles, how many cousins, father, sons, and brothers have you killed, you hypocrite?  I can't say Pitt was miscast as Achilles, given Pitt's excellent work in other films -- the character was just poorly written.  His sacrifice for the maiden Briseas is just plain wrong, but it gives Pitt a chance for a \\"Hollywood\\" dying speech . . . yeesh. <br /> <br />\\"Troy\\" also completely abandons the role of the Greek gods in the battle, which dismisses one of the major plot lines in the \\"Iliad.\\"  I'm sure this was done for the sake of getting the movie completed in under 3 hours -- there are already a lot of characters to beginwith -- but the Gods elevate the battle of Troy from mere tale to the level of myth, and their absence is telling.  Indeed, the Trojans, with the exception of Hector (a stoic Eric Bana), are generally led to their downfall to their devotion to \\"the Gods,\\" who never show up, while the Greeks are motivated by more worldly (and therefore practical) considerations. <br /> <br />The movie gets many things right, even as it rewrites the story. Paris and Helen, whose affair starts the whole bloody mess, are as passive and self-absorbed as they are in the \\"Iliad\\" -- note how Paris (Orlando Bloom) continually fails to rise to the occasion.  Other characters who shine in the \\"Iliad,\\" such as Odysseus, Nestor, Ajax, and Menelaus, are not given nearly as much time to shine and are used generally as plot devices.   <br /> <br />There are several solid performances in \\"Troy,\\" particularly Brian Cox as the dastardly Agamemnon and Peter O'Toole as the wizened Priam, and if you're not that familiar with the \\"Iliad,\\" you will probably be able to enjoy \\"Troy\\" more on its own merits than someone who is really bothered by the fact that \\"Troy\\" takes place over a few weeks while the \\"Iliad\\" recounts the last year in a ten-year battle. <br /> <br />The DVD looks great, and the battle scenes are enjoyable even if they don't rise to the recent heights established by Peter Jackson's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy.   <br /> <br />All in all, \\"Troy\\" is a good movie that somewhat disappoints because it could have been great.  Unfortunately, by trying to make a blockbuster, the filmmakers trimmed corners and softened the edges of one of the great tales of Western Civilization . . . maybe they should have respected the fact that Homer has had considerable box office appeal for over 3,000 years.
B000002LVB|5.0|Time has proven that The Velvet Underground's \\"Loaded\\" is a truly great album.  When it was released it was slapped together as the band was disbanding. The VU purist may say that this album is poor but if you are a fan of great rock and roll this is an album for you.  Sure the album isn't as edgy and experimental musically or lyrically as earlier works.  Albums Like \\"White Light White Heat\\" are certainly more artistically bold but boldness doesn't necessarily equate to greatness. This album would successful if released today and seeing that this one is over 30 years old it has the words classic written all over it.  <br /> <br />Already losing John Cale, the album is almost entirely Lou Reed Driven. The music on the album reflects this and Reed's songwriting really shines with greats like \\"Rock and Roll\\", \\"Sweet Jane\\" and \\"Lonesome Cowboy Bill\\" (well all of the tracks are great).  The sound is fun and the songs may not be serious deep or explorative but they are pure rock and totally unforgettable.   These are tunes that are easy to enjoy and get under your skin into your head and beg to be played and replayed.  \\"Loaded\\" is chock full of great hits and if you are looking for fun music this is a great album.  Stylistically, this album may not be the best introduction to VU but it is a fun first step or just a great album for your collection. <br /> <br />Ted Murena  <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|The above quote, from George Orwell's fictional book \\"1984\\" that was published at the onset of the Cold War in 1949, is a sad commentary quoted in Michael Moore's 2004 documentary entitled \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\".  The book, which depicts a dystopian society that is always at war that is never meant to be won, is used as a comparison by Michael Moore with the current state of affairs by the U.S. Government.  The documentary begins with a brief look at the highly questionable results of the 2000 presidential election that permitted with the candidate with the fewer number of popular votes, George W. Bush, to become president of the United States.  While on a very lengthy vacation at his ranch in Crawford, Texas in August, 2001, Mr. Bush ignored U.S. Government warnings about a potential terrorist attack that would use hijacked airplanes only weeks before the dreaded terrorist attack of September 11, 2001 that saw the destruction of the World Trade Center in NYC, an attack on the Pentagon and leaving about 3000 people dead.  The notion that all domestic flights in the U.S. were grounded immediately after the attack is incorrect, as a number of secret flights carrying Saudi citizens (including blood relatives of Osama bin Laden, the man responsible for the attack) were allowed to leave the U.S.  Hence, Mr. Bush ensured that even though 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11, 2001 were Saudi citizens, no departing Saudi citizens could be questioned by U.S. law enforcement officials that were investigating the horrific attack. <br /> <br />Within weeks of the attack and Americans living in fear, it was then easy for Mr. Bush and his White House staff to promote the Patriot Act (especially former Attorney General John Ashcroft), which reduced the rights, freedoms and privacy of all Americans and the Taliban-controlled nation of Afghanistan was attacked by U.S. forces to weed out al Queda terrorists.  However, as Michael Moore points out in his documentary, some officials in Bush's administration wanted a bigger target to attack, and the preferred choice was Iraq.  In less than a year, Mr. Bush and other White House officials were repeatedly calling for an invasion into Iraq; and on March 19, 2003, they got their wish as U.S. forces did invade that nation, which had never attacked the U.S. The justification used by Mr. Bush and other White House officials to invade Iraq was the claim that its former regime possessed weapons of mass destruction in violation of United Nations resolutions.  However, in the months following the invasion, no such weapons were ever found, nor were any facilities found where any such weapons could be built.  In other words, Mr. Bush lied in order to justify the sending of thousands of U.S. troops into harms way in costly war.  Since the invasion (at the time of writing this review), over 1870 American military servicemen and servicewomen have died, over 14000 have been wounded and an estimated 23000 to 25000 Iraqi civilians have been killed.  It is interesting, as Michael Moore pointed out in the documentary, that of all 535 members of both houses of Congress, only one (at the time it was filmed) had a son or daughter serving in the U.S. military in Iraq.  With Mr. Bush thwarting efforts to investigate the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack, the close ties between the Bush & bin Laden families and the involvement of Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney with the oil industry and military-industrial complex respectively, the reasons for invading Iraq become quite blurred; but the killing continues unabated while Osama bin Laden remains at large. <br /> <br />Overall, I rate Michael Moore's 2004 documentary \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.  What has kept the U.S. a free country for more than 200 years is the right of its citizens to question the actions of the government, which is exactly what Michael Moore did in this very insightful documentary.  Just watch out for John Ashcroft singing.
B000002UAX|2.0|> <br />I wish I'd never clapped ears on the White Album, it certainly didn't capture my imagination. I rushed to buy it when it first came out, I expected so much of it. I'd hungered for it for so long (two years since Sgt.Pepper) like a junky awaiting a fix. I was splitting up with my girlfriend at the time maybe that had something to do with the way I heard it. I'd loved the Beatles previous three albums: Rubber Soul, Revolver & Sgt.Pepper. Each one had progressed and built on the previous one. Each one was full of colour and flowing melody, songs which hung together and complimented one another. True albums which gave you hope for the future.  <br /> <br />The overall sound on the White Album is to my ears no longer three-dimensionally colourful but two-dimensional grainy grey. It sounds like all the out-takes from the previous three albums were gathered together and stuck on one double album. <br />  <br />In short - the songs are crap! I suppose I could pick out about four songs I 'like': U.S.S.R.; Blues; Helter; (Onion and Sadie tie for forth). Revolution 1 was done better on the single (richer sound) and Revolution 9 sounds like someone tuning a radio. The rest are twee novelty songs, except for two which I'll come to later. <br />  <br />I've got a theory that there are two kinds of Beatles fans who dig the White Album: the younger ones who came to the Fabs after they'd done their best stuff (most of these fans would have been under 15 when they heard the L.P.) And Musos who played in bands themselves, because there are more instrumental solos than is usual for the Beatles on this one.  <br /> <br />There are only two GREAT songs on the album: Happiness Is A Warm Gun, and Julia: both written and sung by John Lennon, I think, the first dynamically vast with wonderful imagery, the second yearningly hypnotically melodic. Both intimate. Both unlike anything that had been written before. To conclude, the double-album would have made a great single - as in 45rpmsingle!
B000059H98|3.0|<br />Ten years ago if someone had given you $25 Million dollars and challenged you make the worst flick possible with the money (stipulating that ALL the money had to actually be spent making the movie), it is unlikely that you could have deliberately matched Rachel Talaly's \\"Tank Girl\\". I blundered into a showing of \\"Tank Girl\\" during its short-lived (and basically disastrous) release and found it memorable for its comic page scene transitions (borrowed from television's \\"Wonder Woman\\") and its spoof of the action/adventure movie genre. Unfortunately the animation just makes you wish that the whole thing was animation while the moronic nature of all the live action scenes makes you question whether spoofing the genre was by design or by accident. <br /> <br />Ten years later it has some retrospective interest relative to the disparate career directions of Lori Petty and Naomi Watts. It is simply impossible to make Petty sexy; no matter how glamed-up, erotically posed, or provocatively scripted. Conversely it is impossible for Watts to not be sexy, no matter how hard they try to detune, grime-up, and disguise her. <br /> <br />\\"Tank Girl\\" poses the question, why do so many people dislike it, both now and at the time of its release ten years ago? Lori Petty is the most obvious answer. Petty's basic personality embodies the most irritating qualities of Lucille Ball with none of Lucy's humor and charm. She is irritating even in her low-key roles (\\"A League of Their Own\\"). Apparently she was cast as \\"Tank Girl\\" for exactly that quality and Director Rachel Talaly managed to bring her full irritating potential to the screen. But the producers forgot to connect the dots before they spent $25 Million on production, irritating is sometimes good in supporting roles (insert Stiffer here) but not as the main character. <br /> <br />About two thirds of the way into the story Petty and Watts fall into the hands of a group of genetically engineered fellows called \\"The Rippers\\".At first this appears to be going in the direction of \\"Dark Angel\\" meets \\"Captain Kangaroo\\". But Talaly switches direction a bit and ends up with a post-apocalyptic version of \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\". For a few minutes the movie is actually a lot of fun. Then it is time to get back to the basic story, which by this time everyone (viewers, director, cast, and editor) has pretty much forgotten. This does not pose the post-production problems it does in other movies because Talaly seems committed to insuring that no element of \\"suspense\\" is present to distract you from Petty's irritating performance. <br /> <br />The Tank Girl comic strip embodied a freewheeling anti-authoritarian anarchism, with some feminist and even lesbian themes. Although Talaly faithfully captures a small amount of this spirit she fumbles big time with the basic storytelling (insert no suspense). Which is hardly a revelation given her other directorial attempts (including \\"Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare\\" and \\"Ghost in the Machine\\"-arguably even worse than \\"Tank Girl\\"). If she actually liked the comic strip she should have yielded control to a competent director or at least someone with a basic talent for directing actors and for making feature films.
0062502182|5.0|The Alchemist, by Paulo Coelho, is a moving novel that tells of a boy in search of his Personal Legend.  The boy meets a King, who along his travels as a shepherd gives him courage and a slight guidance to pursue his personal legend.  Before departing from the King, the King leaves a token of recollection and hope, to give him a sense of internal \\"luck.\\"  \\"Take these stones, they are called Urim and Thumim,\\" said the King.  Throughout the journey of the boy's personal legend, Urim and Thumim serve as a symbol of internal belief in oneself to find omens, and a memory of the great King that believed in him.   <br />  <br />Throughout the travels the boy takes to pursue his personal legend to the pyramids, the stones that the King gave him stay with him.  The stones represent a memory of what the King told him, and a reminiscence of what he knew he was born to do.  Although the stones did not represent luck, they were a reminder to him of his personal legend, and aloud him to believe in himself.  Urim and Thumim could help him read the omens of God and this helped him throughout the journey.  If the stones completely told him what the omens were and when they were coming, this would not allow the boy to find himself and know the Soul of the World.  The omens were the key to the boy's travels, which makes Urim and Thumim so significant.  By touching these stones, he could find the ability inside himself to read the omens and learn something from them.  The Personal Legend that was eventually accomplished was not just the treasure or becoming an Alchemist, it was so important because the boy was willing and actually wanted, with rush, to pursue the experience.  The safe feeling inside, the ability to read omens, and the recollection of the encounter with the King were all important pieces of the puzzle of the Personal Legend that Urim and Thumim brought.  Without being there every step of the way for the boy, the boy would not have had the stepping \\"stones\\" to accomplish his goal.  When the King gave the stones to the boy, this was his guide that made it all possible.   <br />  <br />The ability to read omens and have a guide for his Personal Legend was the best gift the King could have given the boy.  No matter what happened, they were by his side, for him to reach out to when he needed.  The symbolism of Urim and Thumim was so great because it represented much more than stones.  They were the keys to unlock the many treasures of his Personal Legend.   <br />

B0009KA7BS|1.0|Not very good horror action movie that has the right stuff but lacks a certain amount of credibility to mix. Keanu Reeves is semi-fine but miscast and he lacks a character the audience can root for and the rest of the movie is hit or miss in terms of the script which is badly written and the special effects which are not up to par in terms of what has been accomplish recently. I have to agree with what has been said about Rachel Weisz, who is the heart and soul of this movie and she does lift it over the mediocre script and funny dialog. Her performance is golden and worthy of a much better movie.  <br /> <br />See it for her alone but you will end up feeling sorry for her for being the only good thing about the whole movie.  <br />
0553573403|5.0|George R. R. Martin is definitely worth the read. A Game of Thrones is so unlike most fantasy novels out there in terms of depth, scope, detail. Martin does not pamper any character within his novel(s). They all can die, be maimed, suffer some tragedy... and they can also find glory, be beautiful, even be honorable... whether the character is good or evil (or a bit of both). He is totally unbiased in his treatment of each and every character, it is a fresh breath to fantasy where so many main characters are impossibly beautiful and flawless (and seemingly untouchable).<br /><br />There are so many subplots within his story but never is it hard to follow what is happening. His storytelling via select character's viewpoints is interesting and captivating. The method allows the reader to see a little deeper into the soul of these characters and to reach a better understanding of all that is involved in their struggles in this gripping saga.<br /><br />Now this all said I will also mention that it may be difficult to  adjust to his method of writing at first. When I first picked up the book I had no idea what the book would be like. Being that you are never really given an introduction to the characters I felt a bit lost for the first few chapters. The story just starts and keeps going. But I kept going with it and once you get past that first few, you'll be hooked! It is quite a ride! Make sure to read the following 2 novels in the series, a fourth is due out soon.
B000001GY9|5.0|I love Bernstein. I think he was absolutely brilliant. That said, I think most of his later recordings are interesting examples of what not to do for creativity's sake.  <br /> <br />There are two exceptions to this statement: The recording of Elgar's Enigma Variations with the BBC Symphony is incredible. There's a wonderful attention to detail, the performance is exciting, and very cohesive both in performance and expression. <br /> <br />The other recording is this Schumann set. In particular, the 2nd symphony. This recording has a level of detail that I've only heard from Abbado, but with Bernstein's temperament, and the Vienna Philharmonic's sound and technical ability.  <br /> <br />For specifics I'll use my darling 2nd symphony as an example. The first movement has lots of vigour without ever feeling juvenile or excessive. In the development, leading towards the recap there is a huge crescendo that takes place over the span of about 1 whole minute - the orchestra starts pianissimo, then builds to a nice piano controlling the sound such that it already sounds like they're playing forte, and they keep going, to a mezzo dynamic, and then forte, and when you can't possibly think the sound will get any bigger it does...just an incredible job with tempering the dynamics and phrasing over a long period of time. It's incredibly exciting! <br /> <br />The second movement, a blistering scherzo, is handled with the most precision I've ever heard from an orchestra. The strings have a remarkably cohesive sound and control of articulation. Bernstein has them slightly break, then start up again at the beginning of each phrase, and it's executed with a level of finesse to be marvelled at. I can't believe this is a live performance. The second trio is the highest point of contrast in this movement, demonstrating a wonderful sense of reserve and serenity. The movement closes with an added burst to the tempo, leading to it's beautifully handled, exciting end. <br /> <br />The third movement is just beautiful. It's slow, but the sound or phrasing never becomes lax - Bernstein truly had the orchestra convinced of his interpretation here. I don't think any other orchestra could have executed it as well. The first climax leaves you with a partial sense of fulfilment, but then subsides into an incredibly tense detached section - the articulations are beautifully melded into the section preceding the final climax, which for me is the musical embodiment of catharsis. <br /> <br />The finale is treated with excellent restraint. It comes across as a regal march, and what so many conductors have made to sound forced and excessive is given great dignity and respect. As a whole, the symphony comes to a fitting conclusion as the trumpet call at the very opening is received in the end by an all-out chorale. <br /> <br />A brilliant work, handled excellently. The other three symphonies in this set are of equal quality of performance and interpretation, but the 2nd is my personal favourite.  <br /> <br />One final note: Schumann was not a poor orchestrator. Someone had to do the work - if he had orchestrated as Beethoven did before him, the music would have suffered. He needed to find something new, without being sensationalist, to express what he wanted to say. I think he met with great success, and these symphonies (when performed well, as on this set) match up with the symphonies of Brahms, Beethoven and the other greats.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|This Film goes back to the basics, and these basics haven't even been scratched by the previous Batman Films. Batman (1989) was great and really enjoyable but unfortunately wasn't timeless. I give it credit because it got non-Batman Fans to explore into the comic books thereby expanding their horizons on the characters in general. Batman Returns & Batman Forever....well they had their ups and downs. (Batman & Robin I exclude totally).  <br /> <br />       After a complete out-burst of comic book films post 1999 we see the full grand scale cinematic appearences of all the Marvel Comic Book Heroes. Again, lot of ups and downs! The X-Men Series leaves a good concrete impression as does the Blade Series. Spider-man and Spider-man 2 make their mark in a sugary diabetic sort of way but still leave the viewer a very satisfied customer. Daredevil (highly underated) stays true it self beginning to end. Hulk, decent special effects and style The Punisher, Elektra etc etc.... I honestly have no real complaints as to how these comic films have turned out; I consider them enjoyable, each in their own way.  <br />      <br />          Enter 2005, enter Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins. It not only Tops the Marvel Universe Movies, it pretty much knocks all of them out of proportion. Christian Bale makes the finest Batman ever, One of the only superhero actors to play his alter ego with the same amount of enthusiasm as he does the title role. This Movie is altogether about Christian Bale as Batman and the rest of the cast (superbly played) blends into the scenes with him (The Main Character). According to me, this in the only comic film that accomplishes that. A Superior Story (David \\"The Dude\\" Goyer), a Brilliant Cast and an extremely talented Director Nolan make this the most memorable superhero movie ever and one of the greatest contributions in 2005.  <br />           The Dark Knight Triumphs Forever!

B000AU9UYM|5.0|The reviews below are abviously someone trying to bring down the average rating for this movie. Batman Begins is an amazing movie. It appeals to a wide range or people both old and young, fans and non fans. It is grounded in reality so is more accessible to people and it is also more faithful to the grit of the comics. Forget the campy tv show and the ott Burton and Schumacker attempts, this truly represents the character, one which is deep and complex. Oh and its not a prequal its a fresh start to a franchise that was ruined.

B0007P3582|1.0|Eminem's music was not too bad, it could hardly be considered a punishable crime. However, his introduction of 50 cent into the world of music should see him stripped of all his possesions, shipped to a remote island and injected with enough anthrax to kill the entire population of Spain. <br /> <br />Overall 50 Cents music has less musical credibility than The Backstreet Boys. He is catchy, that is all. MAYBE BSB went through a breakup and have experience int hat. 50 Cent on the other hand is a millionaire who acts like he lived on the street and was a \\"PIMP\\" (lets glorify a profession that abuses prostitutes! omg joy!). <br /> <br />Rap is a genre that I do not particularily enjoy. Musically it is simple backbeats and lyrically oriented. 50 Cent makes rappers who can write intelligent lyrics look like gods. (Don't get me started on his lyrics, lets just say he writes like a 13 year old who just discovered that he can say \\"F***\\" without the world collapsing)
B00006AW2J|5.0|I cannot believe that my old college roomate gave me this CD since he didn't like it...unbelieveable! <br /> <br />You listen to this once and it will instantly become a top 5 in your collection...Dear Doctor is so well written , composed, and presented, it brings tears of joy to my eyes. <br /> <br />And Factory Girl is equally incredible. <br /> <br />I can go on and on, just buy it...I would even bundle it with Let it Bleed as suggested (did you ever hear Country Honk?), that one also has some awesome gems. <br /> <br />-TM
B0006ZRX86|5.0|There has been so many reviews of this albumn on amazon that not much else can be said about it. I was given a copy of the cd by a friend and did not get to listen to it that much for a while. Once I finally started listenning to the cd it fastly grew on me. After 10 listens I felt so guity I went out and bought the cd. Anyone who is a music fan should give this cd a chance.
0446677450|3.0|The ideas of this book are very thought provoking (and hopefully) action provoking.   <br /> <br />I would recommend the book for some of the ideas, but warn the reader against the fluff and the hype.   <br /> <br />The underlying ideas of educating yourself financially, owning  assets which generate income for you that don't require your constant attention, generating streams of income that are separate from 401K's/pension plans, and using professional help to shelter your assets and income streams from taxes as well as risk from lawsuits, etc., were very motivating.   <br /> <br />I would suggest, however, that you read books by *other* authors (unrelated to the \\"Rich Dad\\" advisors) for *other* perspectives on how to implement the ideas in this book.  <br /> <br />To me, the book was: <br />- 25% useful concepts <br />-  5% examples of how to think creatively about making money   <br />- 70% hype (to help make the author rich by selling the book itself and the many spinoff titles) <br /> <br />Some final things to watch out for: <br />- How self-assured does the author sound in the pre-internet bubble era about his stock investments? <br />- In the property purchase example given, how does the author account for the $20K he needed to purchase the property. He doesn't say. Did he pay for it in cash?  Did he finance that amount?  In the former case, he'd have to come up with $20K out of pocket, or in the latter case he should be reducing his cash inflow by the monthly amount of the financing.  These are important factors that reduce the purported \\"easy money\\" of the deals.
B000001Y5J|5.0|This cd is great. All of the tracks are great. When you buy it listen to it at the end through all the silence and you get two extra tracks!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|After a friend let me listen to \\"Defying Gravity\\" I was immediately taken in. Although I have never read the book or seen the musical, I got a good sense of what the story was about and I absolutely loved the characters! The vocals are amazing as well as the music and lyrics. A fantastic, upbeat soundtrack appealing and relating to anyone interested in Broadway musicals. Definitely my favorite cd at the moment!  <br /> <br />My top songs are: <br />\\"Defying Gravity\\" <br />\\"For Good\\" <br />\\"No Good Deed\\" <br />\\"Popular\\" <br />\\"Not That Girl\\"
B00005UK1F|5.0|This album is definitely different than anything I've ever heard.  I'm a huge metalhead & love all things heavy.  This CD is actually kind of mellow, with heavier parts.  When it comes to the more mellow music, it takes a lot to really get me, most of it just gets really boring.  This is a very good one, sort of psycedelic actually.  A great one to get stoned to.  It has some hints of heavier metal that really adds a lot to it also.  One of my favorite things about it is that it's only 1 song, a song that lasts an hour.  That's something you don't see too often.  If you can get into the more melodic Opeth stuff you'll like this CD for sure.
0679731725|4.0|It took me until page 46 to really get into the book. I started and stopped the book a number of times until he really got started on his trip. Then I was hooked. Stevens's unexpected opportunity to travel gives him the time to rethink his life as a buttler, coming to the conclusion that he was probably not the great buttler he thought himself as. Much of the book is spent reexamining his relationship with Miss Kenton with whom he had a numerous differences of opinion. It's also a study at class, ethnicity and culture, specifically the encroachment of outsiders (neuveau riche Americans) on the well ordered English lifestyle.
B000002J0B|5.0|Still reeling from the success of \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\", the foursome wet to work on an album that they hoped could match up to the success of their previous effort, both commercially and creatively. The result, \\"Houses Of Holy\\", met their goals: it went to number one on the album charts and is one of their best albums.<br /><br />I really am at a loss for words of how to describe the album (this usually happens when I review an album by a band as important to music as Led Zeppelin). I will basically give a brief summary of each song and a rating. Here it goes:<br /><br />\\"The Song Remains The Same\\" - most Zeppelin fans should know this song, which later lent its name to the band's infamous concert documentary. It's a great song, and some of Jimmy Page's best guitar work is on this song. Great way to kick off the album. 10/10<br /><br />\\"The Rain Song\\" - this song I thought was a little too long. However, Page's acoustic work is excellent. He became so well known for heavy riffs like the one on \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" that people forgot how wonderful he was acoustically. But because of the length, I'll only give it 9.5/10<br /><br />\\"Over The Hills And Far Away\\" - once again, Page shines on acoutstic guitar while giving some scorching electric guitar work as well. The lyics are among the best the band ever wrote. 10/10<br /><br />\\"The Crunge\\" - an unlikely mix of metal and funk that can be done the only way Zeppelin can do it: perfectly. 10/10<br /><br />\\"Dancing Days\\" - a great rocker. Harkens back to their blues roots. 10/10<br /><br />\\"D'Yer Mak'er\\" - my favorite song on the album and perhaps my favorite Zeppelin song period. Yes, it's true, this is a reggae song. Well, Zeppelin isn't Marley, but this is one of their best songs ever. It was also a rare single release for the band, and it made the Top 20. 10/10<br /><br />\\"No Quarter\\" - most definitely the creepiest Zeppelin song ever. A lot of the lyrics can back the whole \\"Zeppelin sold their souls to the devil\\" argument. It's still a great song though. 10/10<br /><br />\\"The Ocean\\" - a fun rocker and a Zeppelin classic, but it was always better live. 9/10<br /><br />What can I say? \\"Houses Of The Holy\\" is a classic Led Zeppelin album. Like most of their albums, this belongs in anybody's record collection.devil\\" argument. It's still a great song though. 10/10 <br /> <br />\\"The Ocean\\" - a fun rocker and a Zeppelin classic, but it was always better live. 9/10 <br /> <br />What can I say? \\"Houses Of The Holy\\" is a classic Led Zeppelin album.

B0000AUHOH|4.0|The most hillarious one of the  Star Trek movies.  I really enjoyed all the bits of funny things this episode provided.  Agreeably not as a great story as some of the others, but a funny, human (Vulcan?) type of story.

0553260111|5.0|I came to this book after having seen the film and I enjoyed both though I have to say I enjoyed the book slightly more than the film. In modernizing the time of the story for the film, new technologies come into play making Bourne's flight through Europe almost impossible because he can be tracked via cell phone signals, satelite imagry, email and the internet. In the book's diegesis, the year is 1980 (there abouts) and there are none of these modern devices, allowing Bourne and his female companion more time to plan and to act. I also prefer Maria in the book because she actually has useful skills. In the film she is just there as a convenient ride away from the initial confrontation and later hangs onto Bourne out of Stockholm syndrome. It was refreshing to see her have useful skills and a more robust personality than she does in the film.
B0000026WD|5.0|This must be the best album by Michael Jackson to date. All the songs in this CD actually has a lot of feeling in it, unlike Thriller's songs. <br /> <br />These are my favorites: <br /> <br />1.Give Into Me 5/5 <br />2.Who Is It 5/5 <br />3.In the Closet 5/5 <br />4.Dangerous 5/5 <br />5.Jam 5/5 <br />6.Black or White 4/5 <br /> <br />I recommend this to anybody, MJ fan or not.
192076920X|5.0|I have never written a review before but am compelled to because this book is simply extraordinary. It is nothing short of a love story to Bombay - a beautiful, enduring one - and offers insights about parts of the city that most visitors would never even dream of, from the black market trade in gold, to dinner on the top of the world, to a dancing bear in a slum. It is beautifully written, thoughtful, self aware without being self aggrandizing, and incredibly compelling. It also lends the most interesting and attractive light to so many aspects of Indian life - even ones that sometimes seem exasperating to the outsider. I have recommended it to everyone.
B0007Y08PQ|4.0|This is a 5-star film, ably directed by Jonathan Frakes. I even liked this one better than \\"First Contact\\", also masterfully directed by Frakes. Frakes is proving himself to be multi-talented as an actor and director. (\\"Clockstoppers\\" was a really rad film for kids, and young-at-heart grown-ups like me) <br /> <br />I withhold a star because the Special Collector's Edition has no Frakes commentary, which would have been appreciated by diehard Trekkers like myself. What were they thinking? <br /> <br />The story is well-developed and, as always in Trek, perfectly acted. There is a great Gilbert-and-Sullivan bit with Data, and this is the film where Frakes shaves off his beard!!!  <br /> <br />Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham is a delightfully menacing villain, which is, after all, his speciality. <br /> <br />

B000A1C68S|4.0|I have never read any of the comics this movie is based on, in fact I don't read comics period.  But I loved this movie anyway.  It was gritty and in-your-face and completely shocking.  Even though most of the movie is black and white, there was just so much going on.  It kept you on your feet from intro to credits.  So take an awesome storyline, add a power cast of heavy hitter actors and you've got an equation for one kickass movie!!!  Buy it, this is a must-have to anyone's collection.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Of course there are somethings that have gone overwhelmingly ridciulous for Cold Play. But their sound is always simple and of course for the masses. It's been interesting listen to their last few albums. But this one is one that I probably like as well as any other (IN FACT I LOVE THIS ALBUM!). It's hard to not notice their songs still madly aired on the radio non-stop nowadays.  <br />The same goes for their current single \\"Speed of Sound\\" is smashing the airwaves across Asia it's my favorite single next to Mariah's \\"We Belong Together\\" this year. I must congrat them for not loosing their grasp on their music. Unlike most artists who get wealthy but then loose their grasp on their music. They haven't. But they still give out good, decent, friendly and fun listening music which is more than worth your money. <br />Way To Go ColdPlay you proved me wrong again.

B00000016K|5.0|When Cream formed, Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker, and Eric Clapton were generally considered the best players on their instruments in Britain.  I had vaguely heard of Eric Clapton from his stint with the Yardbirds, but had never heard of John Mayall or the Bluesbreakers. <br /> <br />Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker were a totally unknown quality to me.  Until I heard their first album, \\"Fresh Cream\\", that is.  Ginger Baker's solo on \\"Toad\\" sounded like two people were drumming, because of his twin bass drums.  Me and my Buddies were astounded at the tremendous speed and momentum he kept up for the entire solo.  <br /> <br />Jack Bruce sounded like a good singer, but I had no appreciation for bass guitar playing.  I always set the treble up all the way to hear the guitars and cymbals.  Eric Clapton's guitar just screeched in an era that didn't feature guitar solos or tones.  He and Hendrix were the first two guys I listened to that could carry a band just with a fretboard.  Cream and the Experience were the first two bands I ever heard that featured musicianship as a big part of the package. <br /> <br />In \\"Wheels\\" anyone can hear the virtuosity of all three.  Right up front.  Jack Bruce is a monster, his bass lines powerful AND melodious.  Ginger Baker is a drumming icon, speed, wit, flash and restraint when needed.  Eric Clapton was and remains a guitar legend.  The guy can play. <br /> <br />The album was two records, one in the studio, one live.  The studio recordings feature songs that are multi-layered with strings, keyboards, multiple guitar tracks, and great great playing all throughout.  Felix Pappalardi, an outstanding musician in his own rite, contributed on some of the more obscure instruments.  Pete Brown wrote the trippy lyrics to the Jack Bruce compositions.  What Cream was doing in the studio was about as innovative at that time as anyone. <br /> <br />\\"White Room\\" is just a great, great hard rock song.  Bruce's bass sets a massive tone, and Clapton's wah wahsoloes are fantastic.  One of Cream's ultimate high points in the studio.  \\"Politician\\" and \\"Sitting on Top of the World\\" are blues numbers.  \\"Those Were The Days\\", \\"Deserted Cities of the Heart\\" are more up tempo rockers.  \\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\" is a rocking blues number, with great Jack Bruce vocals.  \\"Passing the Time\\" and \\"As You Said\\" are mid tempo rockers, multi-layered and deserve the label \\"psychedelic\\". <br /> <br />The live side features one of the greatest live songs ever recorded.  \\"Crossroads\\" by Robert Johnson is sped up to a full speed, all out assault.  Eric Clapton does the vocals, but the breaks feature an awesome pair of guitar soloes.  You will be amazed if you have never heard it, or are used to the Eric Clapton post Derek and the Dominoes.  Jack Bruce also lays the wood to the fretboard, and Baker attacks the skins.  The band shows, in about 5 1/2 minutes, what all the hype was about.  Manic pace, fantastic, and I mean fantastic, musicianship, great soloes, and the best rhythm section of all time pushing the featured guitar player.  If you compare Cream to other power trios of the time, they always win.  Somebody in the compared band doesn't measure up.  For example, in Hendrix' band there is a close parity with Clapton/Hendrix on the guitar and Baker/Mitchell on the drums.  Jack Bruce blows Noel Redding out of the water.  They are probably the most talent ever gathered into one group.  \\"Supergroup\\" actually describes these guys. <br /> <br />\\"Spoonful\\" is an extended jam featuring all three playing for about 15 minutes.  \\"Traintime\\" features Jack Bruce on harmonica and vocals.  \\"Toad\\" is Ginger Bakers 17 minute drum solo.  Another monster.   <br /> <br />The two albums show what this band could do.  A great studio album, innovative and timely, and a scorching, crunching live section featuring the three virtuosoes separately and together.  A truly wonderful, lasting, legendary album.

0743457900|5.0|I have read all of John Le Carre's books and consider him to be one of the finest writers of our times. \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" is perhaps the best of so many brilliant novels: it is am amazing and powerful read. <br /> <br />It is unfortunate and absurd that Le Carre has been sidelined by so many in the literary world because he is considered to be a \\"genre\\" writer. Actually, Le Carre (the pseudonym for David Cornwell) writes about the human and social condition and he does so with an intensity of perception and a clarity of insight that are riveting. Our loveable, tired-eyed Smiley, cleaning his misted-up spectacles on his tie, and his nemesis Karla, hidden in the mists of cold war Stalinist terror, are not \\"spies\\" and their engagement is not a \\"spy story\\". They are exquisitely drawn characters that walk off the pages into our consciousness - yes I know that's a clich but it is true in this case.  <br /> <br />The psychological sensitivity that Le Carre displays is quite amazing. You cannot help but feeling the author's own complexity beyond his characters and over the years I have come to deeply respect and identify with him. Espionage is about deception, non-authentic relationships, deceit, betrayal, manipulation, and invention of persona. Espionage is an activity, and Le Carre is a master at underscoring the paradoxes and tensions of the English upper class betraying itself. There is also a personal and metaphoric level in spying - a deeply human dimension - and it is this aspect, sensitively and intelligently pursued, that make Le Carre's works universal, enduring, and exceptional literary masterpieces. <br /> <br />Of course, Le Carre is also a superb storyteller and \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" is a beautifully woven story with enough plots and sub-plots to keep anyone satisfied. What a wonderful book for a cold dark winter evening! <br /> <br />I have read this book many, many times and each time that I put it away I look forward to rereading it the following year. Some reviewers have indicated that this may be Le Carre's masterpiece, and it probably is, but such a ranking is invidious to the quite extraordinary brilliant books that he has written and continues to write. This is a truly beautiful read and if you do not know Le Carre, or if you are only slightly acquainted with him as an author, I do hope that you read \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" and find in it great pleasure and enjoyment. <br /> <br />David S-G <br />
1573223026|4.0|This book is not a classic; it does not have some deep, hidden message. It does, however, have a quality about it that somehow make you feel slightly better about your life. It is very much in the vein of Breakfast Club, as another reviewer mentioned, and if you liked that movie, like I did as a child of the 80s, then you will most likely enjoy this book too. The story is just as improbable, but if you are able to suspend disbelief and accept the fact that these friendships (or whatever these odd relationships may be) would never exist in real life, then you will be able to buy in, and find something likable and all-too-human in these four people. I found myself wanting to stop what I was doing in the middle of the day and escape into Hornby's world for an hour or two. I would consider picking up another of Hornby's books for his unique way of finding humor in unlikely situations and developing characters that matter... at least for a while. Worth picking up.
B000000W5P|3.0|This album is often hailed as the last great Stones album. I tend to agree with that. At least, it is by far better than the later Tattoo You album or anything else by the Stones that came later. However, in my opinion it cannot compete with the classic Stones albums of the 1966-1972 era (Aftermath UK included!! why does everyone leave this album out of their list of great Stones albums??), or even with Black and Blue (despite of a few weak tracks like Hey Negrita: a filler!).     In my view a few annoying songs - like for instance the title track - make that the Some Girls album just sticks in mediocrity, especially when compared to the great classic Stones albums: Aftermath(!), Beggar's Banquet, Let it bleed, Sticky Fingers, and... Exile on Main St.!! (the Stones reached their creative peak then)     The Stones era as the greatest rock 'n roll band on earth began with Aftermath(!) and ended in mediocrity with Some Girls. Unfortunately, after that the creative \\"decay\\" of the Stones only continued... Only the band's reputation as an excellent live act made them survive. Sorry for this very cliche last remarks...

0812550706|5.0|Scott Card and I were college classmates, both a year younger than everyone else. We were not great friends by any means. I always thought of us more as friendly rivals, though I acted in a couple of plays he wrote, and I directed him in a commedia dell arte I produced for a local Renaissance Faire.<br /><br />As for Scott's novels, the only \\"ScFi\\" authors I've really read and liked are Phillip K. Dick, Douglas Adams, and Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., so I never cared much to keep up on my former classmate's career. My only reason for reading ENDER'S GAME, which I did recently, was that I finally decided to see how good old Scott was doing with his little SciFi stories.<br /><br />Pretty well, apparently. ENDER'S GAME is one of the most compelling, the most intensely moving, the most mind-shattering, gut-wrenching, soul-enriching pieces of fiction I've ever read. You can't compare it to other works of literature because it goes beyond that, it really does. I'm serious about this. Back in college I never complimented Scott on anything. I was always fundamentally opposed to feeding his ego, which was very healthy and doing just fine on its own. And I sure as hell don't want to be doing it now (not that he'll read this, or care if he does). But -- wow! -- I mean, we won't know for sure, at least not for maybe another five hundred years or so, but I have a feeling ENDER'S GAME may take its place alongside the Grail legend, the Odyssey, and who knows what other tales of the soul's journey you can name. This is not a novel, it's a guidebook for those who have to take that trip.
B000002H97|4.0|I wouldn't say I'm a die hard Metallica fan, but I know good music when I hear it. First of all, this album contains the seemingly flawless song \\"The Unforgiven\\" I could never tire of this song.  Such an eerie haunting appeal to it.  Hetfield's voice has never sounded so heart felt. Then theres the song \\"Wherever I may Roam\\" which has fantastic lyrics about living on the road.  \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" is the first love ballad Metallica has ever done.  Musically, this song is very calming but I can't say I buy Jame's lyrics about being in love.  Then we have the most commerical of them all.  \\"Enter Sandman\\"  Sure it's over played and everyone knows it but theres a reason for it.  It is a good song, its a great song.  So Metallica decided to go commercial to sell their albums, can you blame them.  They worked their asses off for almost a decade until they started getting the recognition they rightfully deserved.  After people got this album, they decided to listen to Metallica's other albums.  You  may think this is selling out but it's not even close.  Metallica knew if they ever wanted to be Metal legends, they had to put out something everyone would like.
B00009RAJJ|5.0|I just had the pleasure of listening to this album after a long time. The re-mastering brings out depth and clarity to these tracks, which is lacking in the previous CD version. It is like listening to Tusk all over again. I'm not sure I ever understood where critics were going with descriptions like post-punk and avant-garde and new wave (when I think new wave, I think Duran Duran and Blondie), though there are songs on here that remind me of The Pretenders. But what I can say is that this effort is genuine and idiosyncratic. It has much more of a \\"jam\\" feel to it that's fresh and different from Rumours, which can sound over-polished. Highlights includes Stevie's \\"Angel\\", Christine McVie's \\"Honey Hi\\" and Lindsey Buckingham's quirky \\"The Ledge\\" and the title track, probably one of the most innovative pop-rock songs ever written. It took me a very long time to appreciate this album, this re-mastering playing no small part in helping me to realize its true brilliance.
B0001GF2DS|3.0|Classic Clint. What can I say? Sure parts of the movie are alittle slow, but the humor underlying the movie is pretty good. It is nothing more than boys ruff housing with each other But with potentially deadly consequences. Eli Wallach does a good job too.

0441003257|4.0|Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett would seem like a strange combination, but it works. Gaiman is known for his dark, macabre  Sandman comics, while Pratchett is known for his silly take on fantasy. Both are masters of their craft who approach fantasy from completely different directions. Perhaps it is this difference between the two that creates such a good partnership. Gaiman seems to temper Pratchett's tendancy to get too silly, while Pratchett takes the harsh edge off of Gaiman's work. This combination works to create a book which addresses interesting topics while being gut-bustingly funny. Only the two of them together could create an angel and a devil who decide to cooperate to stop the apocalypse and make them funny but convincing at the same time. Overall the book takes the tone of a Douglas Adams book and any fans of the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy will appreciate this book immensly. In addition to fans of Douglas Adams, fans of the two authors will also enjoy this book. It carries the silly fun in Pratchett books and the gravity of darkness of Gaiman's books very well. It does seem, though, that the writing was influenced more by Pratchett. The overall tone of the book seems to have more in common with is books than Gaiman's.   <br /> <br />My only complaint about this book is that it is too short. The ending seems to happend abruptly and lacks the sense of global consequence that an apocalypse would seem to imply. I was left thinking \\"Oh, that's it\\" It was a little dissapointing. It almost felt like they were rushing to meet a deadline or something. Still overall the book is a fantastic read. Essentially it is a fun and easy read. Something to take on vacation.
0316666343|5.0|I read this book a while ago and loved it from page one.  I was automatically engrossed by the tragedy, the whole watching from heaven thing, the characters that are so tragicallyand emphatically real, and of course, the prose.  It is so obvious that this book is a work of devotion and that it's about so much more than Susie's rape and murder. For the person that said that the book could have been written in 3 pages and that Alice was \\"blowing her rape up to proportions\\" in this book (whatever that means), you missed the point.  This book is not about Alice or her rape.  She actuallly started this book and then stopped in the middle and wrote Lucky, the real memoir about her rape, because she felt that her story had no place in The Lovely Bones.  The common thread is rape, yeah, but otherwise, Susie and her family and the other characters in the book are all their own. This book could not have been written in 3 pages simply because the book is ultimately about the ripple effect.  It starts with Susie's death and then we watch over the yrs. how her loss touches those around her and how in turn that affects her emotionally.  Seeing as the story spans years of \\"recovery\\" for the many people Susie's tragedy affects, you can't write about that in three pages. The title illustrates this point really well, as it took yrs. for these \\"lovely bones\\" to form, the moving forward with life and accepting Susie's death.   <br /> <br />For the other guy who said that the book should have focused more on the investigation and the mudererer, that would just make it an ordinary mystery novel.  The mystery factor is never there, seeing as you know from the first chapter who killed Susie, how, and why.  Her family never really knows and that's part of the gem.  We watch them grieve and rage and accept without the gratification of revenge or closure in that way.  Seeing a loved one's murderer get caught and pay for their crime is a grace of some sorts.  It will never bring the victim back, but it helps those grieving to put it behind them.  It is a grace that Susie's family, like so many, never gets. And it's about them trying to build their own sense of individual closure in spite of that.   <br /> <br />I can agree with those who felt the whole body swap thing was strange and far fetched.  It was, but yet it didn't kill the beauty, for me at least. <br /> <br />Lastly, this is a very emotional book.  It's about deep, intense pain and grief, for different people in different ways.  If you're not into nostalgia and don't enjoy reading about people's internal struggles, then the book is not for you. I suspect that many of you who just hated the book, are not into this type of literature.  The Lovely Bones is not an action novel or a mystery, so don't judege it like one.  I think Alice achieved exactly what she set out to do, which is awesome.  This is one of the few books that I actually want to own instead of taking out from the library.  It's just sparkles in it's depth. <br />
B00092ZMDY|4.0|I'll give this DVD set an A+ for video. DTS is C- (minus). Sounds \\"brittle\\" to me. I like their previous release better.<br /><br />Edit: I'm glad to see others supporting the brittleness of the sound.
B0007XT87G|5.0|My intro to Porcupine Tree was In Absentia. It never really grew on me or anything though. I didn't like it too much for one reason or another. So when I was in Borders recently and saw this I was hesitant about buying it, but I'm glad I did. This is one of the best albums I've ever heard. The songs aren't too short and they're well done. Normally I'm not a fan of this softer (than I normally listen to) sound but it's grown on me. Actually, it didn't so much grow on me as just hit me the first time and I've been playing constantly since. The highlight, as pretty much everyone has said, is Arriving Somewhere (But Not Here) and for good reason. It's a very well made song that starts soft, steadily gets harder, then gets soft again at the end (that's probably oversimplifying it but that's what i do sometimes); and it's done well no less. <br /> <br />Definately one of the best cds I've ever heard. Up there with Clutch's \\"Robot Hive/Exodus\\" and Muse's \\"Origin of Symmetry\\" IMHO, even if those aren't really in the same genre as this.
B00026W82U|5.0|Because these Kings of melodic music have struck again with their second full length disc. And it is an amazing follow-up. In fact, after a dozen or so listens through this album, I can not go back to their debut album from 2001. The music is still simplistic, beautifully melodic, but inspired at a new level. This album is brilliant, following in the rhythms of Nick Drake, but marching to a completely different Norwegian beat. And the lyrics have vastly improved from their prior release, perhaps because their English has gotten better in the past 3 years. But, instead of just beautiful voices and beautiful melodies, their lyrics are thoughtful and clever. Try them, you may fall in love.
0060541792|5.0|This book and nightlight combo is absolutely adorable.  It goes without saying that the book is a surefire hit with little ones, but I wasn't sure how the nightlight would be received.  My girls ended up fighting over it because it was so appealing!  Nightlight could be a little brighter, although I guess that's not exactly the point...I can't imagine anyone being disappointed by this set.

0783240287|5.0|This is a great family story, that is told with the toe tapping music and sing along lyrics of Andrew Lloyd Weber.  This is a musical retelling of the Old Testament story of Jacob and his sons, especially Joseph and his coat of many colors.  The brothers, being jealous of Joseph's preferred status with their father, sell Joe into slavery and he's off to Egypt.  The story follows what happens to Joseph, and his brothers after Joseph is sent out.  This is one the kids will request to see again and again.
0316666343|3.0|I just finidshed this book and wonder if anyone else thinks heaven is \\"like that\\". First few chapters make you sad as you read about the rape of a 14 year-old (detailed), conversation between raper and Susie, murder and death, and a dog finding her elbow!<br /><br />At some monents Sebold makes unpredicted moves like turning Susie's mother into a marriage cheater after daughter's death and sleeping with the detective, after which she runs away for years and leaves two children and a husbnad. Or makes Susie's soul enter another woman's body and make love to the guy she was in love with. There a few love making scenes, as well as body admiring aspects.<br /><br />It's more like another evening news story but the intersting thing is that the whole story/novel was told by a dead person from the heaven.
B000000OPZ|4.0|How do you know when you are listening to commerock?  When a self-proclaimed hard rock/heavy metal band suddenly releases an album that your wife or girlfriend likes better then you do.  I guess even \\"hard rock\\" bands have to make a living too.<br /><br />As far as commerock goes though this is a pretty good representative of the genre; I liked the unabashedly commercial tracks i.e. \\"Here I Go Again\\" and \\"Is This Love\\" but I found that I liked the other tracks even better!<br /><br />\\"Still of the Night\\" is my favourite and you have to give guitarist, John Sykes, a lot of credit as he plays some fantastic guitar on this album which makes me wonder why he was replaced soon after.  Have to admit though that many of the riffs he uses he \\"borrowed\\" from Jimmy Page's Led Zeppelin days (in fact, \\"Stil...Night\\" is a prime example of this)but still he pulls the guitar parts off very well.<br /><br />I hope they do remaster this album and even release it in a mini-lp package format as that should make the whole thing sound and even look a lot better.  Even in this unremastered version, I thought the sound was pretty decent enough so overall if you are into commerock, this is a good disc to get although you may want to imitate me and wait for the remastered version that hopefully will come out someday soon.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|I was 16 years old when I stumbled onto an airing of \\"The Kids Are Alright\\" on late-night TV.  <br /> <br />Before that, I didn't know anything about The Who, but Jeff Stein's groundbreaking documentary on the band struck me like a fast ride on a rickety rollercoaster. I immediately bought an Army parka and became an annoyingly avid Who fan, and for weeks watched \\"The Kids Are Alright\\" over and over and over and over....  <br /> <br />My girlfriend at the time sat down for about 10 minutes of it and shook her head in amazement. \\"Man, they're ugly,\\" she said. \\"I can't even decide which one is the ugliest.\\"  <br /> <br />On another occasion, my sister passed through the TV room as The Who performed \\"Baba O'Riley\\"; she stopped, seemingly transfixed by Pete Townshend's windmill guitar slashes and Roger Daltrey's microphone-cord rope tricks, then announced, \\"They... look so ridiculous.\\"  <br /> <br /> <br />Both opinions seemed beside the point to me, and I couldn't really argue: The Who isn't exactly pretty, and I preferred the term \\"theatrical\\" to \\"ridiculous,\\" but then again, this is a band that built its early popularity around the fact that they smashed their instruments after each show and detonated bombs onstage. This is why they're primarily a boys' band. Plus, they played great, thundering songs about spiders and pinball and deodorant and angst. How could a 16-year-old kid not love that?  <br /> <br />\\"The Kids Are Alright\\" perfectly conveys all the bombast of the band and the beauty of the music. Director Stein was barely out of his teens himself when he somehow badgered the band into letting him make the film. For three years, he scoured up hours of live footage of the group (mostly culled from European TV appearances) and, against all expectations, assembled one of the best rock movies ever - it's a not-always-flattering but consistently grin-inducing piece of music history.  <br /> <br />The movie has been released on a remastered two-disc DVD that looks andsounds great. Extra features include a segment that focuses on the late John Entwistle's supremely nimble bass playing (by selecting different audio channels, you can hear two songs with or without the other instruments); featurettes on the restoration process; a funny commentary by Stein; and a trippy new video for the song \\"Who Are You.\\" <br />
B0001MDP3G|4.0|Cold Mountain is a movie set during the Civil War era. It covers the life of a confederate soldier from his time in his home at Cold Mountain, to his service to the South, to his eventual return to his home following a battle wound.<br /><br />Jude Law plays the lead character, Inman, and he is joined by co- star Nicole Kidman as Ada Monroe. The previews for this film tried to portray it as an incredible love story between Inman and Ada. It really isn't like that. The film is mostly about the Civil War and Inman's journey back home to North Carolina. He and Ada write back and forth and they spend a good deal of time thinking about each other. But this film is more of a wartime drama than a romantic picture.<br /><br />Cold Mountain moves slowly at times and the movie is very long- more than 2.5 hours in total length. I found it to be mostly enjoyable, and some of the scenes with Inman overcoming obstacles as he journeys back home are intense and memorable. On the other hand, there are many scenes that should have been axed by the editors. Some of the scenes, during the film's slower moments, could have been eliminated without having any adverse effect on the film. This would have made the movie more concise and helped it move at a faster clip.<br /><br />This movie was nominated for a few Academy Awards and it did win one: The Best Supporting Actress award, which went to Renee Zellweger who plays Ruby, a woman who has lived her life as a drifter and is now living at Cold Mountain, helping Ada tend to the family farm. Zellweger is quite good as the hard- edged, gritty young woman and she deserved the award she received. Cold Mountain also received a nomination for Best Cinematography- an award it certainly deserved to win with all of the great scenery. But it came up short in this category.<br /><br />War films are often overrun with violence and Cold Mountain does have its share. There are some nasty scenes of blood and gore and you will find yourself looking away from the screen more than once. But this is, after all, a war film so some violence is expected.<br /><br />Cold Mountain is a very good movie overall. I cannot comment on how it compares to the novel it is based on since I have never read it. But I can say that the movie is a good one and I recommend it for anyone who enjoys solid performances set to a backdrop of gorgeous scenery.rom the screen more than once.

B00008GKEG|5.0|During the week of Thanksgiving 1995, the \\"The Beatles Anthology,\\" a biography of the Fab Four, rolled onto TV screens around the world, propelled by an inescapable wave of hype. <br /> <br />During the series' run, ABC (the network that broadcast the program over three nights) actually and unfortunately began identifying themselves as \\"A-Beatles-C.\\"  <br /> <br />And while the ratings for the five-hour \\"Anthology\\" were huge, the shows themselves were a little disappointing.  <br /> <br />The programs covered most of the bases of the Beatles' story, but offered very little for the hardcore fans who, let's face it, were the only viewers likely to stick around for the entire five hours. And even at five hours, the broadcast version of \\"The Beatles Anthology\\" was cursory, sanitized and surprisingly short on music.  <br /> <br />Telling the story of the Beatles is a little like building an ocean liner: If you're not going to make it big, broad and fully-loaded, what's the point?  <br /> <br />So it's cool that the \\"Anthology\\" is a 10-hour nuts-and-bolts epic of Ken Burns proportions. Virtually every aspect of the band's history is covered, there's lots of rare performance footage (and music by artists who influenced the Beatles, as well), and the DVD transfer is crisp and clear. It's a completely different entity from the broadcast version, and succeeds in every area where the previous version failed.
0316172324|2.0|This is the kind of book that gives publishing a bad name.  The central thesis of this book - that those who are well trained in an area of study can be incredibly good at making judgments using only a few pieces of essential information - is the stuff of a short magazine article.  And since Mr. Gladwell writes for the New Yorker, it probably was the stuff of a too long magazine article.<br /><br />What Mr. Gladwell has tried to do is dress up a somewhat interesting idea for a dentist office type magazine article into a full-fledged book.  In the process, he has made a huge mess.  This book is all about asides, amusing anecdotes, and often poor scholarship and  poor interpretations of existing works.<br /><br />I know that the price of Manhattan real estate has gone through the roof and rents are ridiculous.  But Mr. Gladwell made a ton of money with his first book.  He can afford just about any condo he wants.  He doesn't have to embarrass himself by writing a mindless piece of candy like this.<br /><br />This book is all about ego and greed.  Essentially, Mr. Gladwell has nothing useful to say.  He just goes on and on in a meandering fashion writing about nothing.  It's like a well-written undergraduate research paper full of b.s. designed to con a professor.  In this case both the publisher and Mr. Gladwell are trying to con the public out of 20 dollar bills.  Apparently, they are succeeding.
0440234743|4.0|I'm a John Grisham fan, and although I loved the intrigue of The Testament,(the trek through jungles, the anacondas, the fevers, the flirtations between characters, etc.)  I did feel as though I was watching a slow-moving soap opera at times.  I have read most of his books, and though they are all good, I often feel that Mr. Grisham attempts to crank out too many books without too much thought at times.  I have recently wondered whether he has \\"ghost writers\\".  Hope not, as I have been a fan for so long.<br /><br />Having said that, any one of the Grisham books is well worth reading.  My own favourite happens to be Runaway Jury.
B0000256KE|5.0|1973's \\"For Your Pleasure\\" is the second and final album Roxy Music performed with Brian Eno, who left the British band over what seemed to be creative differences.  As far as this reviewer is concerned, just about every Roxy Music album of the 1970s is a must-own, but \\"For Your Pleasure\\" is a standout in its own particular way.  After their excellent self-titled debut, these guys could have played it safe, but they instead pick up where they left off and venture intro uncharted territory.  Brilliant glimpses of bold avant garde rock highlight key tracks such as the brash and confident opener \\"Do the Strand,\\" the elegant \\"Beauty Queen,\\" and the signature cut \\"Editions of You.\\"  As any great band would, Roxy Music isn't afraid to get a little weird on us and test our patience; case in point is \\"Bogus Man,\\" an instrumental that takes its sweet time during  its 9 minute running time.  But another distinguishing feature is Bryan Ferry, who succeeds in equal parts as both a suave singer and clever lyricist.  In \\"Beauty Queen,\\" he sings, \\"All of my hope and my inspiration/I drew from you/our life's pattern drawn in sand/but the winds could not erase/the memory of your face.\\"  While they were revered and wildly successful in Europe, Roxy Music never got the American recognition its colleagues Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin earned in the 1970s.  Still, \\"For Your Pleasure\\" is a smashing record whose occasional strokes of genius must be acknowledged.
B0009S4IHY|2.0|I know I'm in the minority on this, but I was VERY disappointed by this move. I had seen Shaolin Soccer, another supposed comedy, and found it mildly amusing at times, but overall a let down. After all of the hype for this film, I thought maybe Chow had improved, so I gave it a shot - I was let down again. The problem with these films is that Chow can't resist inserting flat out unfunny violence and sadism that completely takes you out of a comedy mind frame, and it takes a long time before you can start laughing again. The opening sequence is one example, it is absolutely not funny watching someone hacking repeatedly at someone with an axe, neither is it funny to have a character shot in the back with a shotgun, even if they get blown out of their clothes. Some may say that this is to make you understand how evil the gang is, but at no other time in the movie do they come off as anything other than clowns, so this just hurts the film. There are other moments, but it basically comes down to Chow not being sure whether he wants to make a cartoon or a real kung-fu film. This is definitely a very original film and by the end it does redeem itself somewhat, but the humor is rarely very funny. This is definitely the last Stephen Chow film I will ever see.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|As a fan of Tim Burton, I like his Batman films, but as a Batman fan, they couldn't have been further from the Batman flavor. Or that's what I thought till Joel Schumacher killed Batman with his 'films'. It's sad when a cartoon has better writing then FOUR feature films combined, but that's all the real Batman fans were left with if they wanted well told intelligent stories about Batman and his multi-layered villains aside from reading the books. That is until a ballsy director and writer came along, those people being Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer, and FIXED Batman. Goyer, I had faith in. I'd just hoped he could retain the characters' personalities. Nolan, has MORE than proved he can deliver a dark and gritty Batman film without turning it into dark camp like Burton,or something so insane and flamboyant it would never happen, like Schumacher. I think that's why this film succeeds where the other films failed miserably, because aside from a man in a rag/mask calling himself Scarecrow, and another man in a Batsuit calling himself Batman, the film is camp free, a first for ANY live action Batman representation.<br /><br />Nolan gives us a gritty city with slums that echo the worst from around the world, AND he makes it dark enough to be very 'Batman' without making it look unnatural. Gotham City is supposed to be ugly and decayed, a virtual urban cesspool of crime, and a nightmare for the viewer. I loved Burton's Gothic flavor, but he couldn't capture reality. Everything felt like a fantastic set, but what Nolan does, is give us something that exists. Part of the nature of this film is the internal. Fears, primal impulses, what drives us to do the things that we do. How does a well meaning person go down a path of corruption? What is a person willing to do for justice and is it that far away from vengeance? These are the things the other films NEVER touched on, or if they did, it was never done right. This film does that. It's gritty, it's a crime movie. I think it's the first time since Batman'89 where organized crime was touched on at all, which is a large staple of the BATMAN comics. Simply put, a great comic book movie with a fantastic digital presentation and the DVD extras are fantastic.ink it's the first time since Batman'89 where organized crime was touched on at all, which is a large staple of the BATMAN comics.

B000002U9W|5.0|This is a love or hate album; not many people fall in the middle. If you wonder why nobody listens to Meddle, Ummagumma, More, etc., then this is the album for you. If you don't listen to those albums yourself, then don't waste your money on this album; I guarantee you will NOT like it. I'll break it down track by track. <br /> <br />1. The suite <br />This is a long orchestral track. It's a very enjoyable instrumental with a lot of experimental stuff in it. Not much more to say than that. <br /> <br />2. If <br />One of Roger's earlier compositions, this folk ballad flows like water.  <br /> <br />3. Summer '68 <br />A brass heavy appraisal of the life of a Rock star, kind of 60's. Pretty good track <br /> <br />4. Fat Old Sun <br />My personal favorite track, this song by David Gilmour is very soothing and is one of Gilmour's best compositions. I have this song as my alarm clock, and because of it, I don't mind getting up at 5:45 A.M. <br /> <br />5. Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast <br />Don't let the title mislead you; this song is not very psycedelic. It is a very good instrumental, however. With Alan the roadie as \\"lead vocals\\" and the sound of him making breakfast as sound effects, this song is broken down into 3 parts, each simple yet charming. <br /> <br />Overall; besides the suite, this is a very slow and soothing albm, good for listening on a nice summer day while lying in a hammock. The hammock doesn't even have to be yours, it won't ruin your listening experience at all if it's not. Some people dislike this album because it's slow. That's the reason why I like it. If you're tired of all the depressing stuff that The Floyd has done and want something nice to listen to, pick up this album. If you like the depressing stuff and couldn't care less about listening to nicer Floyd, don't touch this album with a 20 foot pole; in fact, pretend it doesn't exist.

B00006FM77|5.0|Anyone looking for the best example of Chicago as a great band has it right here.  Their improvisational powers are at a peak, their best early hits are here, there's fire and passion in the vocals of Terry Kath and even the usually sedate Robert Lamm, and the guitar playing of Terry Kath is in sharp relief for all to hear.  He really was one of the great unsung guitar heroes. <br /> <br />Best of all, the sound of the horn section has been improved over the original recording.  The sound is much more robust.  Maybe now that infamous \\"kazoos\\" assessment can be laid to rest. <br /> <br />The packaging is also superb -- it's essentially a mini replica of the original box set, complete with all 3 posters and an expanded booklet with new liner notes. <br /> <br />The 4th disc of unreleased performances has further delights -- \\"Sing A Mean Tune Kid\\" is a bit less jazz and a bit more rock in its alternate version, Kath's singing is more controlled in the alternate \\"Introduction,\\" and now we get to hear top-notch live versions of \\"Listen,\\" \\"Loneliness Is Just A Word\\" and \\"An Hour In The Shower.\\" <br /> <br />This set has been slagged a lot over the years, but I've always held firm that it's really an amazing document of a powerful live rock band.  Before the platinum pop balladry, before the loss of key band members, before their respectability eroded in the 1980s, THIS was Chicago -- a band that could hold their own in the company of greats like the Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead, and other contemporaries who exelled when stretching out on stage.  Don't pass this one up!

I have never skipped over so much of a novel in an attempt to get to the \\"good part.\\"  The illustrated maps and maths were tedious and the endless, prattling off-plot narration drove me nearly to distraction.  If you are lured by the gushing, good reviews of this book, do yourself a favor and check it out from your library before cracking open your wallet.
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|I would recommend this film to any Miyazaki fan. If you've seen Princess Mononoke and liked it, this one is the same sort of story. It's a lot older, so the animation isn't as clean, but it's a good watch none the less.<br />The first time I watched this, it was subtitled in English. The dubbing of this movie is well done, like all the others brought over by Disney. Patrick Stewart is one of the English voice actors, so it's a real treat.<br />Of course, if you're not sure about it, rent it. It shouldn't be that difficult to find.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|The stripped version of this WONDERFUL CD is 10x better than the original, especially on his best songs Chariot and I Don't Wanna Be.
B00008PX8P|5.0|If you are a true Led Zeppelin fan you will love the Led Zeppelin two DVD set. It has all the favorites on it that a Led Zeppelin enthusiast would love. It's chocked full of live performances from early in the band's career to late in their career, featuring live performances from Royal Albert Hall, Madison Square Gardens, Earl's Court, and Knebworth. There are also some great extras in this set. <br /> <br />The 1970 performance at the Royal Albert Hall features some spectacular live versions of Whole Lotta Love and Moby Dick.  Moby Dick features a quiet long drum solo by the band's drummer John Bonham. There is some great footage of this solo; especially when he plays part of the solo with his bare hands. These DVD's sound great; they don't sound like they were produced in 1970. They have both been digitally re-mastered. <br /> <br />The 1973 Madison Square Garden performance is my all time favorite. It starts out with a rocking version of Black Dog, and then goes into the rhythm filled Misty Mountain Hop. The DVD ends the performance with The Ocean, which is a timing masterpiece. The song bounces back and forth between 4/4 time and  time. Led Zeppelin was way ahead of their time for doing this. They were probably the first rock `n roll band to do that.  <br /> <br />The sound quality of the Earl's Court performance is impeccable. It starts out with a magical sounding version of Going to California. I like to put the DVD player on the five-channel audio setting that is an extra on the DVD, and let it play through my surround sound. It takes you back to 1973 and you feel like you're sitting on stage between Jimmy Page and Robert Plant. This performance also features the classic, Stairway to Heaven. <br /> <br />The Knebworth 1979 performances were awesome. You can truly see the progression of the band and their maturation process, both musically and physically.  This performance was the most recent of the performances. It starts out with the rocking song Rock `n Roll and closes out with the great performances of Kashmir and Whole Lotta Love. <br /> <br />This is my most favorite concert DVD in my collection. Even if you aren't a committed Led Zeppelin fan you will still appreciate this collection of nostalgic hits. They were one of the most influential bands of their time and for several future generations. These concert DVD's are not filled with some of the insipid sounds of some of the more recent pseudo music that most create these days.  <br />You should really tune into this historical masterpiece. <br />

B0006V6TMG|5.0|I haven't yet heard such a good live recording (in terms of musicianship - not necesarily the soundmix). I think that overall there's a very nice vibe and response from the crowd as well adding to the enjoyment of the CD. And the rhytm ensemble is very nice. I own some other non-live versions of the songs played on this CD, but in my opinion every single one is better on this live CD! get it...
B000A7S4B0|4.0|I knew when I heard the advance cd, people would be a bit upset regarding the departure of the previous two albums' anthems of addrenalin - I was taken back as well, but kinda pleased to see the expansion.  I mean, BRMC are talented enough to not rely on the same formulas.  To be honest, I shouldn't be rating this album so quickly, but for all the people that think it's sorta terrible, I needed to write a review to counter their motion. This band is great.  They still have that Love & Rockets/Jesus & Mary Chain factor working for them - it is just something you will have to sit with instead of instantly saying - I love it...although track 5 is one of their best songs to date.          EXTENDED REVIEW:  Howl is an excellent album that partitions their catalog in two.  The best generic description I can come with is Johnny Cash vs. Love & Rockets.  The lyrics are brilliant, regarding love, religion and self as the focal points.  The music, not a total departure from the previous two, but stripped down to more of an acoustic kickback to contemporary artists like later Dylan.  I don't think BRMC was going for any particular sound, nor gave a care about keeping a fan who loved the last two albums.  This was about keeping it real in a round about way - and what they are into, NOT what the fans expected them to do, which I totally respect.  I don't mind people saying this record is not what they are into, but to say it is terrible means you have no clue to what music is.  No offense, but I guess take some.
B00006FM77|3.0|This recording has its moments with songs like South California Purples,Mother and It Better End Soon.The really good thing about it though is it's the original group with the likes of Terry Kath,Pete Cetera and Danny Seraphine inclusive. For better takes on their songs you might want to check out the Live in Japan recording or the current DVD they made with Earth Wind and Fire.The DVD with EWF is especially good. Still the memories of the original band.....
B00000IL67|4.0|<br />\\"THE LIFE & CRIMES OF ALICE COOPER\\" <br /> <br />REVIEW: <br />\\"The Life & Crimes of Alice Cooper,\\" which spans 4 CDs, features 81 tracks of import releases, rare tracks, single version releases, demos and the original studio tracks. Plus, the box set also features Alice's contributions to the various soundtracks he's been featured on over the years. Sadly, Alice's early 80's albums were shortchanged and the absence of live material is sorely missed from this collection. So, this set certainly isn't definitive and isn't necessarily a true retrospective of the great Alice Cooper either.  <br /> <br />MUSICIANS: <br /> <br />Various artists. <br /> <br />INTERESTING FACTS: <br /> <br />1. Released on April 20th 1999, \\"The Life & Crimes of Alice Cooper\\" failed to chart on the Billboard Top 200. <br /> <br />2. For inclusion on the box set, there was the thought to record a new song with all the original members of the Alice Cooper Group but Warner Bros. nixed the idea. <br /> <br />3. After five long years, the box set would finally arrive featuring atleast one song from each studio album. <br /> <br />PACKAGING: <br /> <br />Very good packaging includes four picture disks and a booklet. The booklet contains an intro written by Johnny Rotten, liner notes written by former 'Creem' editor Jeffrey Morgan, and tributes from Bono, Vince Neil, Iggy Pop, Joey Ramone, Nikki Sixx, Ron Zombie; among others. <br /> <br />APPROX. RUNNING TIME: <br /> <br />Disc One: (21 tracks) 74:19 <br />Disc Two: (22 tracks) 74:35 <br />Disc Three: (22 tracks) 72:44 <br />Disc Four: (18 tracks) 73:26 <br /> <br />Total: 4 hours and 54 minutes (... and 24 seconds) <br /> <br />FINAL ANALYSIS: <br /> <br />This set is ideal for the uninitiated but the die hards may be disappointed. **** out of 5. <br /> <br />
0780021967|5.0|The transfer alone should be enough to relieve film buffs that one of the best has been rescued. There is always an integrity in the Criterion Collection releases. The audio essay by Marian Keane is a big plus. The included 1937 Lux Radio Theatre adaption helps give a contempory context to the era in which the film was still in the consciousness of the movie going public. A documentary on Hitchcock's British period is informative and welcome. Excerpts from the press book as well as production design drawings are a wonderful behind-the-scenes touch. <br /> <br />Samuel DeLong
B000002UJQ|5.0|Essential rock not only for the fans, but for anybody who wants to understand what was happening in the 90's.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Having seen a lot of things young Mr. Pegg has done on various television shows - including the amazing \\"SPACED\\", which everyone who enjoys this film should immediately seek out - I was anxious to see him in something bigger.  <br /> <br />My hopes were all realised when I went to see this film... and I can't begin to tell you how much pride we Brits take in his success.  <br /> <br />Simon Pegg has excelled himself by co-writing and starring in the Rom-Com-Zom as Shaun, a boring everyday British bloke. The cast is an amazing plethora of current (as well as timeless) British comedy talent, many of whom, like Simon Pegg, had been lurking in the shadows of cultdom for far too long. <br /> <br />Special mention goes to the very cool Bill Nighy, playing Shaun's dad... Nick Frost is disgustingly brilliant as Shaun's slob of a best maye... and watch out for the AMAZING Dylan Moran in the role of David, Shaun's enemy and a lecturer. <br /> <br />You should definately give this film a go... it sums up a certain essence of British comedy, as well as the mood of the current day here in England.  <br /> <br />But don't think the comedy in this film is entirely English, and no one else will understand it or think it's funny... trust me, you will. Also, the numerous iconic film quotes peppered throughout the film is interesting enough, and hilarious to hear taken out of context.  <br /> <br />This is a homage to all the zombie films you have ever seen and loved, as well as a milestone in both British filmaking (think Trainspotting) and new British Comedy.  <br /> <br />Give it a try, I guarantee you will not regret it!
6304806418|3.0|Madonna surprised me. She worked. She had some obvious weaker spots, but she was bearable. <br /> <br />SONGS MADONNA SCREWED UP ON AND WHY: <br /> <br />Buenos Aires- She should have belted some parts instead singly softly (also this whole song just did not work.) <br /> <br />A New Agrentina- Madonna's worst number without a doubt. I despised this song. It just did not work. The high and amazing notes were brought down for Madonna- it brought the whole song down. I also disliked Jonathan Pryce (get to him later) on this song. <br /> <br />High Flying Adored- I have never liked Eva's part in this song. I think it should be Che's solo, but Madonna did not make it any better for me. Her voice sounded extra weak and very strained.  <br /> <br />Hello and Goodbye- It just sounded weird and she didn't have enough.. hmm what's the word?... Patti in her! <br /> <br />Antonio Banderas wins the award for BEST PERFORMANCE IN EVITA THE FILM! He was amazing. I very upset that his hcaracter was so small. They should have enlarged it instead of making it smaller. He did so well. His \\"High Flying Adores\\" was breathtaking. He also nailed \\"Oh, What a Circus\\", \\"Lady's Got Potential\\", and every other song he is in. I liked his character alot more here than in the play. Che was more likeable. In this movie, I began to think that Antonio Banderas was playing a guy named Che not Che Guevara. That works so much better. This character should be, on stage, just the voice in the back of everyone's mind. I loved the way Che was repseented in the movie. <br /> <br />Joanthan Pryce's performance was the reason this movie recieved a 3 instead of 4. He ruined \\"She is a Diamond\\". He just didn't work in his role. His voice isn't very strong, and Peron really does need a strong voice when your Evita lacks a little in the upper range depratment. <br /> <br />The guy who played Magaldi was okay. He didn't sound very good the first time her say \\"On This night of a Thousand Stars\\", but his repirse wasfabulous. Also the \\"Eva Beware of the City\\" scence seemed so awkward beause of his singing. <br /> <br />I loved Eva singing \\"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\\". I thought it fit her character perfectly. Although the whole thing with Magaldi walking into the apartment and having a family (I guess) was very confusing. I also loved how this song kind of became Eva's anthem. She reprised it many times and every time it conveyed a similar emotion which really worked. <br /> <br />MY PROBLEMS WITH THE MOVIE: <br /> <br />Madonna's hair in the beginning- She looked way too old, but if her hair were longer she would have looked much much younger. <br /> <br />The song \\"A New Argentina\\"- I hated how it was chopped up. (other reasons explained above) <br /> <br />The song \\"Buenos Aires\\"- They should have made it vibrant and colorful, not dingy!  <br /> <br />This movie, although it had its share of problems. The one thing I was most happy about is that I like Eva at the end of the movie. I also like how Peron stuck by Evita, and I liked the new twist on Che and him just showing up and playing different characters. That was so awesome. I really liked this movie- I was bored at times- but then a great song came and I was happy again. I reccomend this movie to anyone.  <br /> <br />And I must admit: IT IS BETTER THAN THE PLAY (except for Madonna- Pati was better.... but Madonna comes in second!) <br /> <br />So, what happens now? <br />So, what happens now? <br />So, where are you going to? <br />So, where are you going to? <br /> <br />You are going to get Evita!! How cheesy!!  <br />
B000003TA4|3.0|Actually From what i heard when i listened to the album was that,it's nothing special,totally overhyped by people.I don't care who Kurt cobain is coz he's just another frontman of a rockband.The thing is that,you go to any record store and purchase any rock album by artist like staind,you find that nirvana and staind are pretty similiar,lyrics about teens angst.But the thing is that staind is bashed heavily by critics.I don't understand why people like to follow blindly but personally i felt that nirvana is an ok band,nothing much,if you want to know what good band is go check out radiohead,muse,and a whole lot out there.
B0007O38XU|5.0|This is an incredible CE 2-DISC Set I've been waiting for 8 years. Now that it exists, I'm still waiting to be able to pull it out of my back pocket; put it in a tiny plasma screen while i'm in the senior lounge with my friends. I mean can you imagine it? It's absolutely breathtaking where technology is going these days.
0786185791|4.0|Less plot, more pot than On the Road. Where Kerouac's most famous novel was all about reckless travel, music, girls, and rebellion, Dharma Bums is more introspective.  Lots of meditation, soul searching and existential ruminations about life, truth, and nature. My only regret is that I didn't choose the book format, as it was hard to keep up with all the philosophical ramblings while listening in the car.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|If you gave this movie a negative review, the only explanation is that you take yourself way too seriously.  Is it cinematic genius?  Probably not.  But y'know, when the movie gets over and the credits start rolling, you just feel good...about anything and everything.  No, it's not because you feel superior to Napoleon, it's because you're happy that things turned out alright for Napoleon, Pedro and the rest.  It's a feel good movie, get over it.
B000001GE5|5.0|While sometimes a little faster than generally performed (as my teacher put it \\"because he can!\\") Pollini exeplifies near flawless technique with wonderful interpretation of Chopin. The only complaint I personally have, is that the playing seems a bit technical, and not as much emotion is put into the actual peices. Though Etudes are not generally known for their musicality, Pollini, I feel, could still be afford a little more push/pull in some of the selections.  <br /> <br />Pollini does bring a new freshness to the set of preludes. Overplayed and sometimes butchered by the amateur pianist, Pollini peroforms these preludes masterfully and brings them to a level that I've rarely heard.  <br /> <br />Other than my minor complaint, I feel that for any student or teacher willing to complete, add or update their library this is a great choice. Pollini delivers a crystal clear performance, worthy of any listener. Easily one of my favorite recordings in my collection!
0425180638|5.0|Cornwell fans will enjoy this book.  A lot of twists and turns and psychologiocal supspence.  One of the major highlights of this book is when Dr Scarpetta gets a call at the morgue asking her if she wants to talk to a Benton Wesley- a character that is supposed to be dead.
B0009K7QZ8|1.0|Ok! This is a good entertainment for evenings when you don't have nothing else to do. Then you maybe enjoy to watch these people's adventures and relationship problems. Don't think too much and you will get more for this.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I have always better things to do than waste my precious time to watch this teen series. <br /> I can clean my toilet, eat worms and run naked on the football stadion.
B00004U8JV|3.0|<br /> <br />I remember I used to love both movies. I thought they were absolutely amazing, fun and sorta scary with surprises and as major plus the Sequel is focused on my favorite character Ian Malcolm played by the odd-ball Jeff Goldblum --- Sam Neil's character, Dr. Alan Grant from the first movie (I disregard the third movie since it was neither a book and directed by Spielberg. It was absolutely horrible), although from the book (his character was much more likable), wasn't very interesting in terms of personality. I didn't like the changes they made to his and Dr. Ellie Sattler characters, I.E., - Making them a married couple when in the book Ellie was Dr. Grant's student for something if I remember correctly. But nonetheless I loved the movies. Now however, both to me, are regarded as 3 star movies (A long time ago they would've been 5 stars) because Given how long its been since I've seen this movie, as well as the first one as well as how many times I've seen it, they're not really impressive anymore. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The plot for \\"The lost world\\" isn't the brightest (Ian Malcolm is tricked into going another island that INGEN left unattended when he discovers his girlfriend Sarah Harding has gone to this island by the request of the former owner of INGEN John Hammond. Joined by a Nick Van Owen, his daughter Kelly (against her father's wishes) and Eddie Carr they go to the island to rescue Sarah. When Ian's girlfriend doesn't wish to go back they discover a group of poachers and INGEN Employees lead by Peter Ludlow. They're luck takes a turn for the worse when Nick Van Owen and Sarah Harding decide to sabotage the INGEN Camp and take an injured baby Rex onto their trailer, thus angering T-Rex mother and father. From there the INGEN team and Ian Malcolm and co. travel across the island to get the abandoned INGEN Building to communicate with the outside world for help.), heck, its the best from Spielberg but Its an enjoyable that doesn't jump theshark with what it was trying to do. The characters -- at least the major ones -- are interesting as far as movie characters go.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />However, the most annoying characters have to be Ludlow, Harding, and Owen (Especially Harding); they do nothing but cause trouble throughout the entire movie, thus never helping whatever cause to escape they had. While \\"Jurassic Park 3\\" just had minor characters dying for no good reason and every single one of the main characters surviving (Billy should've been dead, as well as the little boy, the mother, the father, and perhaps Dr. Grant himself) --- The lost world actually had consequential deaths; Whenever the characters died it was because of a mess they got themselves or others into (I.E., Dieter Stark, Peter Ludlow, extras characters, Ajay Sidhu, Eddie Carr, etc.). However the major downfalls of the movie are the obvious bloopers, mistakes (how'd all the crewman of the ship get killed when the T-Rex was in the Cargo hold. And baby T-Rex was already in the city), a weak plot, and most of the acting provided by Jeff Goldblum (whose character really doesn't feel like the character from the the two books or the first movie despite his truma) and Julian Moore, but its entertaining all the same. All in all I still like this movies it just doesn't hold the same \\"wow\\" factor for me anymore. P.S.: if you're new to them and are going to watch at least two of them; Pick \\"The Lost World\\" and \\"Jurassic Park,\\" don't touch \\"JP3\\" unless your in the mood for a MAJORLY bad B-movie of horrible proportions -- . [a 3 out of 5]

B00006JDU9|4.0|First of all, to all fans and critics who were committed to spending the entire summer of 1999 bashing this movie, I say you all don't have a brain in your head! <br /> <br />Right of the bat, I will agree, yes, Jar Jar Binks was a rather annoying character, but not nearly as bad as the Ewoks in RETURN OF THE JEDI.  I remember one of the main criticisms of this movie was that it was nothing like the original trilogy.  OF COURSE IT WASN'T!!!  This is all supposed to be 30 years earlier!  It's supposed to be an all-new film! <br /> <br />Next there was the issue of the confusing polititcal storyline.  Well, what else did you expect?  The rising of any Empire is likely to always start with a political conflict.  We're introduced to that with the Trade Federation boycott of the planet Naboo and slowly learn that Senator Palpatine is secretly a Sith Lord who has been planning his takeover of the galaxy for a long time.  If all of this is too complicated for the average viewer, then keep watching it until you get it! <br /> <br />Die hard fans with nothing better to do will continue to unfairly bash Episodes I, II and III.  As time goes on, though, they'll probably improve with age because there will be no more films (at least not while George Lucas is alive). <br /> <br />For the record, I AM hoping that someday, after George is no longer with us, 20th Century Fox will commission some new, young, imaginative director to make Episodes VII, VIII and IX, with an all new cast playing Luke, Leia and Han.  Sure, it sounds terrible now, but who knows; twenty, thirty years from now, we all may be starving for some brand new STAR WARS adventures to honor the legendary legacy!
0156027321|4.0|One of several books I have read this summer as I try to catch up on some of the more popular modern lit. books from the last few years. If you read the other reviews than you already know the basic premise. Most of the book is a first person narrative by a teenage boy who is adrift at sea for 8 months in a lifeboat with a Bengal Tiger. It is very engaging and even funny at times. At the end of the book, the boy must describe how he survived to a couple of investigators. They do not believe his story so he gives them an alternate version and tells them they can choose which to accept. That is the exciting part....so must the reader. The reader must decide if the entire narrative of the book was just an allegory for a very different and much more horrid reality.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|What do you get when you have an actor who can't act, a director who can't direct and a script that is so badly written that you will be laughing your head off at the same time you are throwing up at the pure stupidity of it? You get one of the worse movies ever made. Keanu Reeves performance in this film is so bad, it makes his Bill and Ted movies look Oscar worthy. The direction from first time Director Frances Lawrence is flat out horrible with lousy direction and murky cinematography and the script is so badly written that you are really surprise by what you are hearing from the actors' mouths from time to time. Of all the actors involved only Rachel Weisz and are able to come out of this horrible film with their dignity intact with good performance that this movie really did not deserved. Other than them, almost everybody involved should hang their heads in shame for making such a bad movie. <br />
B00028HBKM|5.0|This Mel Gibson remake of the classic Life of Brian is not nearly as funny as the original.
B00005NNMK|4.0|I grew up listening to Europe, granted they were not the heaviest rockers of the 80's but that was fine. Europe had harmonies, something that was lacking in most of the Metal Bands. Joey Tempest had a great voice and is a terrefic songwriter evident on this whole album. Hey writng good pop is not easy. If you want a headbanging album, you will be dissapointed, if you want to hear catchy songs and a great ballad \\"Carrie\\" get this album. The funny thing is that most of the reviews I read so far on this album are right, this is not their best stuff. Very enjoyable nevertheless
B00070DK5K|5.0|If you are a Bowie fan or think you could be, this is the CD for you. Released more than 30 years ago, it is still the best Bowie recording ever! Sound quality is excellent and David was at his best. You won't be disappointed.
B0000026J1|4.0|Does actually that, feels a little bit more bluesy. Great ballads \\"Open Your Heart\\" \\"Tommorrow\\" although \\"Coast To Coast\\" was a little cheesy. \\"Ready Or Not\\" just flat out rocks!! Europe again shows how talented they are, great vocals, good guitar from Kee, maybe a little too much keyboard but it worked fine on \\"Superstitious\\" Problem here is this is the follow up to a very successful album \\"The Final Countdown\\" it was destiny that it would take a back seat. hearing it now after all these years it sounds good, and worthy.
0375422889|5.0|Persepolis 2 is not as compelling as Satrapi's first memoir, which doesn't change the fact that it is a very, very good graphic novel.  The artwork is outstanding and the story flows quite well.  The glimpse the book gives of Iran, and of an individual life trapped between two worlds, is invaluable.
B000021Y77|4.0|Run Lola Run was a great illustration of how life is about decision making.  The director Tom Tykwer did a great job at writing and directing this film. <br /> The movie is about Lola, Franka Potente, trying to save boyfriend Manni, Moritz Bleibtreu, by finding one hundred thousand marks with in a twenty minute time span.  The marks are for his boss, which will not forgive Manni, for not having money on time.   <br /> The movie starts out with one scenario, which she starts out by hanging up her phone thinking where to start to get the money.  After she leaves she passes the roommate, the dog, nuns, an old lady, and the biker.  Getting to her destination everything fails and the story fades away with her and Manni talking.  Then the story starts all over again.   <br /> The movie plays out three different outcomes in Lola's life.  The title Run Lola Run is the perfect name for this incredible movie.  Lola is running through her life the entire time to save her boyfriend.   <br /> There are not too many movies like this movie.  This movie is very unique in its own ways.      <br />
B0006L16N8|1.0|Dear oh dear, what a mess this album is. It makes A Rush of the Blood to the Head seem original. Every single song on X&Y follows the same plodding routine, ambling along with lyrics expressing pain and frustration about the world. They're interchangable, derivative, unimaginative and boring. Very boring. A Rush of Cold Blood was not that good but I'm amazed at how much the band seems to have regressed in just two years.
B0000C6K09|5.0|These CDs are a pure pleasure for the ears. When we listen all this music we can remember all the images of the different films. <br />It's fantastic: Indiana Jones, Harry Potter and the best of the best Star Wars. <br />Listen this music in your car and feel the effects on you. It's magic!!!! <br />John Williams is a real master. <br /> <br />Leya (from France)
0140120416|5.0|This is a great book and I believe that with this anyone with a serious interest in the language can learn it, at least learn to read and write it (speaking/listening would require presence of Russian speakers, either being in Russia or attending a language course). Also, the great thing about this book is that it covers the material (which contains phrases, vocabulary and grammar) in chunks that you can cover in a limited space of time. Therefore it makes it very practical in daily life if you have to fit it into a busy schedule (work/school/whatever). A good value buy!
B000AYEL1A|4.0|As I grow older I shudder at some of the films that influenced me so much growing up. Garland's \\"A Star is Born\\" is one of those films. I still love many parts of it, but when the extended version came out on video I had to re-assess the film's overall validity. I do think that this \\"Star\\" belongs to James Mason. His performance is one of the most tragic performances on film any where. And sorry to say, I just couldn't find the forgiveness in my heart for Judy Garland's lack of professionalism, something that ruined what could have been a shining career.  <br /> <br />Now to the Seventies: I was on the road in a touring show and with three of my friends went by cab in Eerie Pa in the midst of a blizzard to see the Streisand \\"Star.\\" To this day, I prefer hers to Garland's. The structure is tighter, the characters are clearer and for its time Streisand's \\"Star\\" is much more timely. <br /> <br />I, like many, have become disappointed with Streisand and her egotistical antics--like in Vegas demanding that any hotel employee who looked her in the eyes as they passed her in the hall would immediately be fired. Come on, Babs, stardom has its perks and anonymity is not one of them. So laugh all the way to the bank and to posterity, if you behave. <br /> <br />I haven't liked anything Ms. Streisand has done since the \\"Superman\\" album and \\"A Star is Born.\\" How can anyone compare it unfavorably with the tart sweetness of \\"Prince of Tides\\" or the downright foolishness of \\"The Mirror Has Two Faces\\"? <br /> <br />I can't wait for the DVD version of \\"A Star is Born\\" to be released. I'll think of my friends and me in Eerie Pa, the only four people in a movie theatre in the midst of a blizzard.
B0002S943O|5.0|A word of warning - If you're thinking about buying the One Night in Paris DVD, don't do it!  I had this one and ended up selling due to disappointment.  I've been to several of DM's concerts back in the late '80's and early '90's and the DM I saw back then is what I was reminded of in this DVD.  Devotional is much better in my opinion.  Gahan's vocals are much less embellished (a good thing) and he showcases his talent much better in this one -- maybe the drugs and being younger had something to do with it, but nonetheless, it still works for me.  Song selection is good, though I am partial to some of their later releases, such as Ultra, songs of which are not captured here.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|This is 1 of my favorite rap cds. ive listened 2 eminem 4ever & ever since D12 released their 1st cd ive adored their style. theyre exactly like the early eminem, not afaid of being different & not caring what other people care!! although their songs r a little stereotype b/c their songs are mainly about guns, violence, & chicks. sum of the things they say r \\"eminem-ish\\", meaning funny, weird, & unexpected. it good that sum of their songs r serious & sum 4 just fun & joking. i mean even sum of the serious songs have funny lines. this barely compares 2 their 1st CD in my book though, \\"devil's night\\" was & will be my favorite D12 CD ever!!
B00003JRCQ|4.0|This movie appeals to a wide audience (in my house at any rate!)  I, my wife and my 8 year old daughter all enjoyed it.  (My daughter needed a little help to understand the plot at times but loved the atmosphere and was thoroughly caught up with the characters.) <br /> <br />My only minor complaint is that the heroine is a little one-dimensional.  For most of the film she appears to go into a state of shock whenever she's in the company of her true love, and the transition to animated, attractive, even pushy lover is a little abrupt.  <br /> <br />But if you enjoy Jane Austin adaptions on the screen, this is one of the better ones.
B00000J2PH|5.0|The songs on this CD are timeless, as is Carole King. They take me back to a different time, but are as good today as they were  in the '70s. Carole still rocks!
B0009HLDFU|5.0|Disk 1 -- Boy, is Dave Grohl pissed. Disk 2 -- he's gonna be ok.  The experiment of \\"two disks with two totally different sounds\\" fails for most artists, but it really works here.  Each stands on its own, whether crazy play-it-loud rock or haunting acoustic ballads.  The best songwriting I've heard in a long while.
0312995423|5.0|Digital Fortress of Dan Brown is an excellent and unputdownable thriller. I really enjoyed it and learned a lot about code breaking while reading it. Strongly suggested for vacation reading.
B000002MY3|5.0|I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS ALBUM, BUT I'LL START BY SAYING WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT, IT STAYED IN MY CD PLAYER FOR OVER A YEAR, LITERALLY. I COULDN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT AND I LISTENED TO EVERY SINGLE SONG, THERE ARE NO JUNK SONGS ON IT LIKE THERE ARE ON MOST CDS.

YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THE HYPE AND YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU FINALLY HEARD IT.
B0009X766Y|5.0|Here's the real deal.  The U.S. out-of-print \\"The Sting\\" DVD's are full screen.  The U.S. September 6, 2005 \\"The Sting\\" DVD is cropped widescreen.  I have watched both presentations, and BOTH ARE FINE.  Neither presentation distracts from the FUN.  If widescreen gives you a warm fuzzy feeling, get the new one.  Purists will want the old full screen with no top/bottom picture loss.  The dreaded \\"This film has been modified from its original version - It has been formatted to fit this screen.\\" message on the 1998 full screen version is MISLEADING.  The only \\"modification\\" is more picture at the top and more picture at the bottom than the widescreen theatrical release had.  The director shot the film using 35 mm 4:3 open matte, but his bosses chose to crop the theatrical version.  Oh, and note that this and all earlier reviews were written before the September 6, 2005 cropped widescreen version release date.

Sing finds all of his Kung Fu Master brothers and eventually they form a football team that would scare the best defences in the world today using their newly taught football skills.  A great fun comedy with a refreshing angle,  a must for those who have a soft spot for martial arts and football, even a little romance for the ladies, Suitable for children aswell,  its like Matrix meets Bruce Lee, the goalie is a ringer. I love this film.

0930289528|4.0|Some of you reading this might already know that a film version of this early masterpiece by revered comics scribe Alan Moore will be coming out in March '06.  Written and produced by the Wachowski brothers (of \\"The Matrix\\" fame) and starring Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving, it's sure to be huge.  I don't want to rain on their parade (I'll be sure to see it myself) but I don't see how any movie can do justice to this complex, subtle and incendiary graphic novel.  (If you're reading this after the film has been released, my review title still stands:  read this book first!)<br /><br />Originally written in the early 80's for the British comics magazine \\"Warrior,\\" this is the story of a future Britain (1997!) that's been isolated from the world because of a nuclear war and taken over by a group strongly resembling the real life far right/neo-Nazi National Front.  They've gotten rid of immigrants, minorities and other \\"undesirables\\" and ruled the citezenry thru surveillance and fear.  Then comes a man known only as \\"V\\" who vows to bring back true freedom.  Obviously, the premise owes plenty to \\"1984,\\" \\"Brave New World\\" and other such works but in execution it's another of Moore's subversions of classic comics tropes (\\"Watchmen\\" or \\"Miracleman\\" and his run on \\"Swamp Thing\\" come to mind.  Also \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.\\"  Okay, much of Moore's work subverts classic comics tropes).  Basically, \\"V\\" is an anarchist reimagining of Batman, though instead of a pointy-eared cowl, V prefers a Guy Fawkes mask and a top hat.  Instead of being a crime fighter, V is a criminal fighting a corrupt government.<br /><br />This is all well and good, but what makes \\"V For Vendetta\\" such an achievment is all in the execution.  Important events that happen later in the story are foreshadowed in such a way that you don't realize that it happened until you go back and re-read it.  Evie, the young woman who unwittingly becomes V's accomplice, is one of the richer female characters to appear in comics, even in a high-end graphic novel such as this.<br /><br />Then there is the matter of David LLoyd's art.  The dark, sometimes rough pastels of the colors give the story a kind of watercolor-meets-film noir feel that's striking, especially when compared to the computer-assisted chaos that so many of today's mainstream comics go for.  Still, I often wish I could see this book in b&w, since the remaining ink drawings would be wonderfully minimalistic, almost like Frank Miller's \\"Sin City,\\" although with far more subtlety (this is no knock on Miller's vision, which is incredible in it's own right).<br /><br />Okay, so the premise raises a lot of questions that are never answered, and the ending is at once muddled and overly simplistic.  The ride is still incredible.  Evie's stay in a fascist prison (this is why Portman recently shaved her head, and may I add that she's still HOT!) is heart-rending, and ultimately mind boggling.  It should also be noted that V himself is not entirely heroic--he often comes off as merely vengeful and quite possibly insane.  That he's essentially a terrorist with a taste for bombing London landmarks might give some people pause due to current events--yes, the tubeway comes into play here too.  This is of course no fault of Moore's, since this story was completed nearly two decades ago, and in fact it gives the story added relevence.  One starts pondering the ethics of our protagonist's actions even if you concede he's taking the only options available to him to fight against oppression.  Did the Nazi resistance also have elements of terrorism, no matter how just their cause?<br /><br />This is all the more reason you should investigate this first before seeing a film that, due to the form's intrinsic limitations, might only give a glossing over to the heart of this story as a trade-off with Hollywood spectacle.

B000021Y77|5.0|If you are like me, you are probably sick and tired of all the crap that Hollywood throws out year to year.  There is no originality left in Hollywood, rather just conventionality.  Most movies today are cycling through the same themes, plots, motifs, and archetypes of yesterday's movies. The German film Run Lola Run, however, has taken an original approach, separating it from the common Hollywood movie.   <br /> <br /> First, in the movie you are shown three different scenarios with 3 very different outcomes.  The idea the director plays on is that acting different in any one point in one's life can lead to startling outcomes - that every act is important and has its effect.  In the movie, Lola, the main character, has twenty minutes to get her boyfriend a hundred thousand dollars cash, otherwise he will be killed.  Acting slightly different each time she brings about shocking outcomes for both herself and her boyfriend.  Hollywood movies on the other hand, will stick to one scenario, showing you how events would occur in one perspective.  In reality, things never work out as well as they do in the movies.  Hollywood will never account for life's many obstacles.  Furthermore, the one-perspective- Hollywood-movie is usually the same perspective as all other movies from the past and present.  <br /> <br /> Aside from the three-scenario plot, the movie also incorporates deep symbolism, which cannot be found in Hollywood.  No matter how many times you watch this movie you can find more symbolism.  For example, in the scenario where Lola is killed, many items are noticeably red, such as the color of her hair.  In another scenario, when her boyfriend is killed, many items are noticeably yellow, like the color of his hair.  Dissecting more of the movie, you find more and more symbolism in everything from names, to the moneybags, to the use of green as a symbol for money.  By contrast, in the typical Hollywood movie you are hard pressed to find just a few symbols.<br /> <br /> Finally, the movie leaves the audience in a state of inquiry.  You question whether it is better to make decisions based on intuition rather than reason.  You question the merit of reincarnation.  You question whether someone can will something to happen.  Most Hollywood movies leave you with the typical happy ending, all questions answered.  The whole reason writers write is to force you to examine a theme.  Walking out of a Hollywood movie you are not forced to think about some aspect of life or human behavior.  More often than not, the only question you are looking to answer is why did I watch this?  <br /> <br /> In my personal opinion, the movie Run Lola Run is an original movie, surpassing the typical Hollywood film.  The movie gathers a wide fan base because of its unique plot setup, its hefty and intricate use of symbolism, and its ability to leave the audience in a deep state of inquiry.  I recommend that anyone seventeen years and older go see this movie (the movie is rated \\"R\\"). If you want to get the most out of this movie watch it as many times as you can...     <br /> <br />
B000021Y77|5.0|This film was brought to my attention during English class. Since, I have added it to my own collection. \\"Run Lola Run\\" is an exciting, upbeat movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat.           Mannie and Lola are the main characters. They are the German Bonnie and Clyde. Lola is driven by loyalty-Mannie by money. Each plays a vital role in the film. However, the story centers on Lola's ordeal, hence the title, with brief interjections into Mannie's experience.           The director carefully sequences three, very possible, scenarios that lead you to yearn for the criminals to succeed. Each scenario contains events that are particular to that version of the story. So, do not blink because some changes are subtle yet intricate to the story line.            Music sets the pace. Techno sounds blare in the background, forcing you to keep up with the scenes smearing by. The music controls you-you are but putty in the director's hands-as you hang on every note.           \\"Run Lola Run\\" was better that I ever anticipated. It was very enjoyable and addictive. Each time I watch the film I see something new; I am now going on my fourth viewing.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Bland rip off of a great comic book not only puts the worse actor imaginable for the main character but has a script that is almost a crime in itself. The dialog is so bad that it would even make deaf children cry and the special effects are not as good as one might hope. Some of the acting is great and that's a great feat in itself because of how bad the script is. Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou and Peter Stormare do great work here and for that, people should be grateful for but it's still Keanu's film and he still torpedo it with a lousy performance that is in tune with the lousy script it has.  <br /> <br /> <br />If this is the best they have to offer for the fans of the comic book, then take it back. <br />
0385486804|4.0|It is hard to imagine anyone reading this book and not thinking it's anything but very well done. From the clichd moment I picked it up, the book had me hooked. Granted, the book didn't hook for me long. Due to its small size, it took a mere 2 days to get from start to finish, hardly enough time to appreciate the excellent work manifested in the pages here.    It's probably fair to say I will always be drawn to well-written books about nature and the outdoors, and man's endeavors into it. See my reviews on Winterdance and Magnetic North to bear witness to this fact. Having said that, I believe it's also fair to say this book (and the other 2 mentioned) are tales that most people will enjoy, regardless of your relationship with nature & the outdoors.    The story in a nutshell, without giving too much away, is about a young kid who treks \\"into the wild\\" in an attempt to find himself and get away from society and its endlessly vapid and decadent existence. It is a common theme of escape & exploration of many youths, even if the path he takes is not. What transpires is  a trek, as the title suggests, into the wild, the details of which are left as an exercise to the proverbial reader. It's well worth the read, to say the least.    The book is fascinating, perplexing, and hard to put down. Krakaur is very good writer who delves completely into the material at hand, fully embracing the details of the story. Because of that, I believe this is his best work to date. His strong desire to discover the 5 Ws about a tale come through on the pages, his passion easily discernable in his words.    On the other hand, I think the story suffers because Krakaur so strongly embraces this lifestyle and the main character's choices. As a result, he sometimes gives more leeway than he probably should, explaining things away with a line of reason that often doesn't follow from the details presented. To an extent, there are traces of deification in Krakaur's tale, and this detracts from the book for sure.     I won't say these things are a concrete detriment to the flow of the book as a whole. Perhaps it would be more accurate to call them wisps of doubt clouds that float through an otherwise excellent story. Krakaur isn't a dreamer. He acknowledges people make mistakes and that nobody is perfect. While his perspective may not lie in the center of the double yellow line of objectivity, he admits as much, never trying to hide the fact.    In all, the book is a great read, and quick at that. I think it will appeal to a wide range of readers and does a great job asking and (usually) answering questions which come up through the course of the narrative. He explores various details of those 5 Ws to the point of visiting some of the same places the main character did, in an attempt to experience the elements he was writing about. It comes out in the pages, developing into an easily readable book which tells a fascinating story of an interesting individual.    Well worth it, highly recommended.
0446677450|2.0|I read Robert Kiyosaki's book \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" many years ago after hearing a multitude of individuals who had recently finished his \\"How To\\" guide.  I thought that since so many people found his book to be helpful that there must be some sage advice contained within that could better help my own financial future like it did Mr. Kiyosaki.<br /><br />I didn't realize until after I was finished that THIS BOOK is what drives the author's financial success.<br /><br />The author provides some (I stress SOME) positive ways to look at money as a whole and focus energy in your life, but I found his methods to be unrealistic overall.  The author states over and over how he is so rich and so successful because he made his own paths, but he forgets to mention that a lot of luck and great timing came into play (like his timing of success as it relates to the sales of the velcro wallets).<br /><br />I don't doubt that the author believes in what he writes, but one of his earliest and most important pieces of \\"advice\\" is to not buy a home, instead recommending to rent for the long term.  Isn't this something that is learned in Finance 101?  I am sorry, but unless you have some amazing deal, you should always try to put your money into a home instead of just burning it away by putting it into rent payments month after month.  This is just one example of Mr. Kiyosaki's unrealistic approach to obtaining financial freedom.<br /><br />The impression that I got after reading \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" (and also after reading one of his numerous book sequels - I only read one of them) is that the author used his timing and luck to build up a bankroll to start his career.  With this early wealth, he then decided that he would jump on the self-help bandwagon and push his own ideas to try and sell to the masses.  Because of the nature of people to always be searching for a \\"quick fix\\" to everything in their lives, the author stumbled upon an even bigger way to achieve financial freedom, and the \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" empire was begun.<br /><br />Overall, I think that the author's \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" has some decent points to inspire you to try and make it on your own in this world as it relates to your financial freedom, but if you are looking to achieve that by reading this book, save your money and put it into something else (like buying a home).<br /><br />** NOT RECOMMENDEDdom, and the \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" empire was begun. <br /> <br />Overall, I think that the author's \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" has some decent points to inspire you to try and make it on your own in this world as it relates to your financial freedom, but if you are looking to achieve that by reading this book, save your money and put it into something else (like buying a home). <br /> <br />** NOT RECOMMENDED

6304712499|5.0|I remember seeing this when I was 6 (or 7, I can't remember). I loved it! Now I came on here, and I expected the average rating to be 4.5 stars but THIS IS JUST STUPID!!!<br /><br />This movie is about a man who is killed by 2 of his worst enemies. He then, goes to hell, (Not a place you would want to go when you die. Trust me, as a Christian I would know) and is led to earth by an annoying clown, to try and save his girlfriend.<br /><br />I didn't like the animated series, but the movie is much better and realistic. The special effects are realistic, and my only objection is that it could have had a better ending.<br /><br />BTW, If you are going to buy this movie get the 18A (or R, for you Americans) instead of the 14A (or PG-13). The R rated version is much better. Otherwise, don't be a puppet of the haters and go watch this movie.

B00001OH7Y|3.0|I am suprised to see all the stelar reviews here. This ablum is good, but far below the previous four, Station to Station, Low, Heroes, and Lodger. OK, Lodger isn't up there with the previous three. Still, I bought this when it was released, liked it, but felt it was somehow of a let down after his Berlin period. (After Let's Dance, I stopped buying his music altogether.) To me it represents his wanting to be normal, after years of being pretty unnormal. His glam period may have been very pop driven, but his persona was quite shocking in the early 70's, so his music remained an acquired taste then. His LA and Berlin periods were, except for Young Americans, very introverted, not usually a good quality for reaching the masses who fear introversion. Yet those two periods are my favorites. Then, Bowie got normal, moved to Switzerland and started Scary Monsters, Let's Dance, etc. Kinda like Madonna in reverse. She, normal pop for years, now experimental. Bowie, experimental, now normal. I prefer the experimental work of both. This perhaps is a transition out of the Berlin period and as such is good, but I can't rate it too high. Sorry.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Britney spears is not a great singer in the first place, but I have to say that she really did it this time. She made a cd that has some sexual motives to a few of the songs, and a tad bit of neud in the pamplet. Below are my comments for each song: <br />1.Me against the music- This song is TERRIBLE! Sexual motives in it, and very boring. <br />2.I got that boom boom- Kind of loud and obnoxious. Can get on your nerves. BIG sexual motive in this one! <br />3.Showdown- Boring and lame. <br />4.Breathe on me- A quiet, but sleazy song. <br />5.Early mornin'- Could make you fall asleep. <br />6.Toxic- It does have some rhythm and tune, but (again) it has innapropiate motives. <br />7.Outragious- THIS IS THE WORST SONG YET! SEXUAL TALK, NO TUNE, AND NO RHYTHM! <br />8.Touch of my hand- This is one of only two clean songs on the whole cd. <br />9.The hook up- A \\"must not listen to\\" song.  (same as all the other ones) <br />10.Shadow- This is actually a song youngsters could listen to. No sexual talk, rhythm, beat, and nice to dance to. <br />11.Brave new girl- It's okay for young children to hear, good party music. The motive is that the brave new girl is going to go out there and have fun. <br />12.Everytime- Typicle yuppy song! <br />13.(remix) Me against the music- As bad as the origianal.
B0009UC7QQ|4.0|From the moment the plot device is revealed, that Truman's life is an actual show, this film drives home the pervasive note and critical insight into our society -- how we as a culture have become not only exploitive in the extreme, but totally void of conscience and inner purpose.  For, like Truman, we are all pressured to pursue that which society imposes upon us, no matter how empty it may seem; as if some heartless eye is indeed watching our every move, directing our very lives for the sole purpose of selling soap.  But... if only we, too, could span the lake in a daring sailboat voyage, and reach the edge of reality on the other side, to discover god and a true purpose.  Perhaps, we can.  Perhaps this hero's journey is our own.  Let us learn from Truman, and not simply change the channel at the end, vapidly.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This album took a few listens for me to appreciate its advances over Parachutes and A Rush of Blood, but now I can't stop listening to it.  The major advances are that overall the album is considerably more epic and that *every single song* is very good, both lyrically and musically.  As for Coldplay detractors' claims of influence--so what?  Hearing influence in music is like tasting wine--some people taste strawberries and others pepper in the same bottle, some people both, whether in the nose, on the palette, or in the finish.  Yet the wine doesn't contain any strawberry or pepper.  So, if you like strawberries or pepper, what's the problem?  I taste in this album everything from the common U2 to the obscure Nick Drake (and yes, Radiohead, but also even some fun counterbalance from Duran Duran and perhaps a hint of Jefferson Airplane) with an interesting range in every song that has a nose-palette-finish progression of emotions, paired with consistently formidable lyrics.

Only flaw is the director commentary for the first disc - seems to be nothing but stuff he said during interviews spliced together.

B00000ILDF|2.0|The first time I saw this movie I wondered how they could mess something up so badly. The second time I found some parts had improved (but not by much).<br /><br />First, the alien was a mixture of cool, sleek, killing-machine but also looked somewhat fake on the small screen of the TV.  The heavy use of computer graphics allowed them to do a tad more with the creature than you could do with a person in a suit.<br /><br />Still, the story takes away, I think, from the Alien myth.  It made the drone a tad too smart and the beginning of the movie was a tad confusing.  I still don't know how the young queen got in there without killing Ripley.  Too many questions and no real answers.  Mystery is good, but total chaos is not.
B00008NG5V|5.0|This CD is a perfect soundtrack for chilling out with your buddies!  Every track is worth listening to, the first time I heard \\"Traffic in the Sky\\" I was completely hooked by its rythym and lyrics.  Jack Johnson has a way in writing his songs, he can either get your head bobbing or let think you think and let loose.  This CD has been heavy on rotation in my car since I got it.  A must buy for all Jack Johnson fans!
B00012FXAE|5.0|Few sequels end up being as good, or better, than the first movie that spawned them.  Aliens is one of those few.  Space marines, a swarm of drones, a Queen, everything they added to this movie, added to the Alien myth, was a perfect addition, crafting a piece of artwork that has stood the test of time, just like the first Alien.  The discs have tons of extras, commentary by much of the people who worked on it and even footage not included in the 1986 version.<br />Note: Bill Paxton who plays a marine (Bug Hunt man!) in this film also plays a cop in Predator 2.  He dies in both - bummer.  BUT as the two legends have now been LINKED into one universe maybe that means his characters are related?
B000001GQU|4.0|This is a truly great recording of Verdi's emotional Requiem, and I'll not try to add to the other reviews here.  However, I do have one little quibble: the bass drum solos in the Dies Irae sections are not played forcefully enough.  They are a somewhat unexciting  \\"boom\\" instead of an earth-shaking \\"SLAM,\\" as in Shaw's and Solti's recordings. This is, as I said, a minor point, but if you're a percussionist like me it can get on your nerves.  I recommend getting the Fricsay along with the Shaw or Solti, because apart from the bass drum and the dated mono sound it is a great recording.

As other reviewers have noted, the principles voices just don't match the excellent original (stage) cast recording (Michael Crawford, Sarah Brightman) and unlike \\"Evita\\" where the movie orchestrations enriched and extended the stage musical, there's nothing new here. <br /> <br />If you are living on a desert island, have never seen Phantom on the stage, and you are curious, you might just buy this. But if you've seen the original, you are likely to be quite disappointed.
B000069KGM|3.0|Well, it's a good start for the band, but it's too much noise and senseless tracks here. It could be a great single album instead of a double one.
B00006FM77|5.0|I've waited quite a while for Rhino to re-release this set of recordings.  The wait was well worth it. <br /> <br />This is early Chicago they way they were meant to be.  In their early days this was a real rock-n-roll band, powered by Terry Kath's soulful voice and magical guitar.  Add in keyboards and vocals by (Mr. Chops) Robert Lamm, bass and vocals by \\"Pete\\" Cetera, percussion by Danny Seraphine and the world-famous Chicago horns - Walt Parazaider, Lee Loughnane and Jimmy Pankow (the world's only hard-rock trombone player) and you have one of the finest musical group's to ever grace the stage at Carnegie Hall. <br /> <br />David Foster ruined this band in the 80's by steering them away from their rock and blues roots while popping out a series of wedding reception balads. <br /> <br />This is Chicago at their rock-n-roll best.
B0006L16N8|3.0|When I bought this album I didn't have great expectations... I tend to listen to critics from a source in Denmark and they usually always share my oppinions on music. (Also on this album) <br />There are a couple of outstanding tracks like \\"What If\\" and \\"Low\\" but the rest all sound like each other or something Coldplay has written on previous albums - that's not very creative. <br /> <br />All in all it's a pretty disappointing experience and the only reason I give the album as much as 3 stars is because of the few highlights on the album. And the mixing job is nicely done, as well.
B0000DJZB9|4.0|im a big guns n roses fan and i  had to buy this great collection of music videos.this dvd has paradise city,sweet child o mine, welcome to the jungle and many more! the only complain i have about this is that some of the videos are pretty corny and weird like in estranged slash is floating on water and playing the guitor.but they also have good videos. i wouldnt say this is the best collection of videos but i say these are still damm good videos!
0141020318|3.0|Walter Hartright, a young artist from London, falls in love with Laura Fairly whom is one of Walter's art student. The other is Marian Fairly who becomes Walter's best friend. But, how these three people get involve to the woman in white? <br /> <br />  <br />This story use many characters for leading the story in under to show the detail of the other person's thought. <br /> <br /> <br />I don't recommend this book if you like a mystery story because this story is not mysterious enough. It looks like a dramatic story although the book's name looks mysterious. Additionally, the end of the story is too easy to predict. however, the flow of the story is expressed well and can show the emotion of the main character. So, if you look for an easily reading book, this book could be one of your choice. <br />
B00005ATQ9|4.0|In Barry Lyndon, it seems like Stanley Kubrick takes great pains to distance his audience from the drama.  Title cards let us know the ultimate outcome of the film's two sections ahead of time; an omniscient narrator sounds like he himself cares very little about this tale; when Barry is in Prussia speaking German, we are not even provided with subtitles.  Though Barry is clearly the main character, it would be a stretch to say that we experience the film from his point of view.  He is certainly not a likeable protagonist.  And though I felt pity for many of the film's characters, I found it impossible to sympathize with any of them.  I did not feel satisfaction at Barry's rise, or sadness at his fall, nor did I feel like he or I or anyone learned any valuable lesson from his story.   The acting is good enough, though, and the film presents us with characters that are interesting to observe for a time. <br /> <br />Visually, the film is magnificent.  It practically oozes period, every pore saturated with 18th century.  There are gorgeous costumes and sets, as well as photographic lighting and composition that are truly breathtaking.   <br /> <br />I guess it would be easy to dismiss Barry Lyndon as film with a glossy exterior but no inner soul, but I don't truly feel like this is the case.  It seems like the Barry and his drama are not the central point of the film, but more an important part of a greater aesthetic whole.  This film has an amazing sense of rhythm, and as the camera moved hypnotically, the scenes played out, the music sounded, and the dramatic motifs recurred, I found myself becoming more and more engrossed in this lush and beautiful work. <br />
B0000029GA|5.0|Im going to keep this review short because all nine songs on this cd are hot.  This is prob the best lyrical rap album ever to be released.  I Personally rate this as the best hip-hop album of all-time...some people will say Eric B & Rakim's \\"Paid in Full\\" is but to me this is my favorite.
0060763280|5.0|I went to an evening seminar held by T. Harv Eker himself. I bought the book that nite (along with 10 more!). The seminar + the book motivated me to attend the 3-day seminar (NJ June 2005). As a result of this book (which is a summary/teaser for the 3-day seminar) I now have a personal success coach, my attitude at work has changed drastically, my wife thinks I'm taking some kind of happy-life-is-awesome pill, I have more energy and all my hair grew back (ok i lied about the last one!). <br />Along with many other things the book provides you with a simple money management strategy as that is key to becoming financially successful. <br />I highly recommend \\"Feel the fear, and do it anyway\\" by Susan Jeffers, it compliments this book completely. <br />I've given a copy of this book to a number of friends and they can't wait for the December MMI. <br />This book is the first step to financial freedom. I highly recommend it.
B000002WU9|5.0|This album is a hip-hop classic.

B000000XB9|4.0|If you are a baby boomer and want a wonderful trip down memory lane this CD does the trick.  All of CCRs best took me back to high school days of cruising around the local burger joint on Friday after the football game.  As Yearwood sings \\"The song remembers when.\\"  This CD took me back to a time long forgotten and music that should never be forgotten.  Classic.
0060234814|5.0|This book is a great as it is described.  Read the book and you will understand why the book has been a favorite for over fifty years.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I have never listened to music like this before much less bought it! I ran across this cd purely by accident and when I listened to the sample clips I thought it sounded nice enough to give it a try. I ordered the cd and have played it constantly! I absolutely LOVE it. The flow of the music and the stunning sound of thier voices will wash away all your cares. I truly become immersed in the melodies and I just can't praise Celtic Woman enough. I use this cd for relaxing at night, meditation and especially driving because it keeps your stress levels down. I put it in my portable cd player and do housework to it. I promise it will melt your cares and stress away and leave you with a contented smile on your face.
B00005JMAH|5.0|I recieved this movie in a timely manner brad new and have enjoyed the thrill of Harry Potter's exploits ever since.
0345308239|5.0|This is a book that is very easy to read. It is succinct and thelanguage smooth. The points made in the book are more relevant today than at the time that the book was written. I am sure that if Barbara Tuchman was still alive she would surely add another chapter on Iraq, changing the title to THE MARCH OF FOLLY: FROM TROY TO IRAQ. <br /> <br />It is a work that I would highly recommend to any serious student of histroy as well as those who are cocnerned with the  progess of humanity.
0898159156|5.0|Warning! Carnivorous plants are addictive. Don't be fooled by that cute little Venus Fly Trap or Sundew and think that you will just buy one. Wrong; one will morph into five, five into twenty-five, and the next thing you know, you will have a great terrarium set up, carnivorous houseplants competing with your African violet, and planters outside that the neighborhood kids come to feed bugs to. You will also be giving impromptu science lessons for anyone who stops to look at your unique plants. And this book will help. It is probably the most accessible book on carnies out today, and seems to have fueled a mini-explosion of publishers trying to follow D'Amato's lead. The writing is clear, and written for people who like plants but are not botany nuts, or botanists. D'Amato also did a very good job of explaining how to grow plants from different areas of the world without having to resort to charts of zones and endless consultations of thermometers. If you are interested in carnies, buy this book, you could also pick up Adrian Slack's book as well, but start here first.  <br />
0786852550|5.0|In search of the next Holy Grail of books in the genre of Harry Potter, I bought this book with little expectations. Jonathan Stroud's strong sense of plot, characterization of his two heroes, young, wizard-to-be Nathaniel and wisecracking, smart aleck, Bartimaeus (his character flies off from the pages!!!) and dark, humorous storyline is simply outstanding! Don't just borrow a copy of this amazing fantasy book if you are a collector. Buy your own copy! Stroud sits beside J.K. Rowling as an amazing storyteller and in some cases, might have overtaken the throne! Nathaniel will be your next best friend after Harry Potter! Be ready to enter the world of Bartimaeusology!
0316172324|4.0|Instinctive decision and I placed the book back on the rack when I first picked up at a local bookstore. However, again some hidden instincts made me read the book. The cover page ain't impressive and its a snap judgement, maybe. In a Blink, the decision is instinctive - That's what the Book speaks about. The best selling author of 'Tipping Point', Gladwell reveals psychological facts on behavior patterns of people. Gladwell builds his cases that are supportively influential to a reader and makes him think small and focus on the meaning of \\"thin slices\\" of behavior. He has case studies on car selling, heart attack, etc. which explains his concept of thin slices - upon the information, derive to decisions. However, I feel that often the judgements may wry wrong with the decisions if its only based on information. The sixth sense or intuition plays an important role in thought manipulation. Snap judgements turn people off-track in decision making sometimes but in a blink, first decisions do turn the other way round. Experts in the field have proven decision and are correct in their presumptions. However, Gladwell's case studies is indepth as to pros and cons on accuracy and how one can go about 'Blink' - snap judgements. The book is fine as long as you like to ponder over. The fact remains - your own snap judgements or the intution, the sixth sense always helps you to make decisions! Fine read.
0446677450|5.0|Or maybe it was just ego that got in the way.   <br /> <br />The first time I read it, all I could think of is \\"Geesh man, quit repeating the same thing and get to the point!\\"  So, naturally, it didn't sink in too well.   <br /> <br />Then after picking it up, dusting it off and reading it without the ego in the way, it made much more sense.  Yes, the concept is very simple.  This is not about getting rich quick, this is the FRAMEWORK for building wealth.  This is basic, but infinately essential.  I can't imagine how wealth is created any other way. <br /> <br />I sure wish I'd have read this book before I struggled through two painfully boring and sensless semesters of accounting in college.  This book answers the WHY of accounting in a very simple manner that, as he says, just isn't taught in school.  If you know the WHY, you can endure any HOW. <br /> <br />I've since purchased the Cashflow 101 e-game.  And again, it's incredibly simplified, but lets you practice the powerful concepts explained in the book.
B00004TH6O|5.0|This CD is a brilliant, long-lasting, good-for-all-occasions work of art. The diversity, and consistent quality of tracks means you can have it on all the time, anytime.<br /><br />The bonus UK disc contains three great new songs, the best being \\"Never Say Never\\". The song starts off with tinkly harmonics, and Homme just sounds...cool. The chorus sticks in your head (\\"I might like you better if we slept together\\") and the riff afterwards is very catchy.<br /><br />\\"Who'll Be The Next in Line?\\" is ok, still a 4-star song, but not one of my favourites.<br /><br />\\"You're So Vague\\" is a rewrite of Carly Simon's \\"You're So Vain\\" and is quite sexy, pumping, thumping and pulsating etc etc<br /><br />On the main CD, there are a mix of lazy stoner epics (it IS a genre!) - \\"In The Fade\\", \\"I Think I Lost my Headache\\", \\"+\\" (which ends with a scarily insidious brass piece), and \\"Better Living Through Chemistry\\". \\"Autopilot\\" is in the same vein, sounds a bit like the Foo Fighters though.<br /><br />To add diversity, there are two utterly perfect screaming sessions, entitled \\"Quick and to the Pointless\\" and \\"Lightning Song\\". These songs are two-minute sonic extravaganzas...seriously. You'll have to irritate your friends by having little \\"moments\\" where you'll try and get everyone to understand the beauty of them. It may take a while.<br /><br />The other songs, Leg of Lamb, The Lost Art of Keeping a Secret and Monsters in the Parasol are the \\"just rock songs\\". Still, they're a cut above most other mainstream rock, thanks to Homme's lovely melody-making and sexy voice.<br /><br />All in all, it's an excellent album, part of the soundtrack to my teenage years. I am amazed at QOTSA and their consistency in delivering excellence again and again. A must-have for any rock fans.
0553382179|2.0|I picked up a boxload of organization books and of them all, this one stood out for the roughest tone of voice I've ever heard outside a military context. This lady gives orders. Every day starts out with demands upon demands. If you fail at any of it, how do you recover the rest of the day? She sounds so masculine, I've wondered if there was a Fly\\"Lady\\" at all, maybe that's a device used by a male to cover a severe lack of respect for his clients. Frankly, I don't know how anyone with any self-respect or sense of adulthood stands this \\"lady's\\" constant nagging. Perhaps if you're in a mental state where you can no longer make decisions for yourself and want to go submissive, hoping someone else can make your decisions and it will all feel better Real Soon Now, this text is the right tone.     Try her mailing list first, you can get a taste of that TONE and see if you will tolerate it. Be aware that she will spam you to DEATH day and night there. Same as this book.    There are more professional, gentler sounding organizers around, people who don't sound like the Inquisition first thing in the morning. Define your problem carefully. You might find that a book  on ADD might be more helpful than simply being harangued to shine your sink RIGHT THIS MINUTE.
B000001Y5J|5.0|IF the industrial genre tag should ever be applied to NIN, it should be on this album only. Dark as hell, heavy beats, lyrics surrounding torture, and thrashy songs all make this album amazing. The Skinny Puppy and Ministry influences can be heard througout, and Trent hits the Nail on the head (sorry for the pun!) <br /> <br />You can listen to this album every day for weeks and not get tired of it. Happyness in Slavery is my personal favorite song of the album, it's angry and sexy at the same time. However every song on this album is stellar, including the bonus tracks (Trent's cover of \\"You're So Physical\\" is awsome) <br /> <br />After listening to this go download the Broken movie if you want to really see how pissed off trent was when he made this, it's still the most disturbing music video I've EVER seen.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney Spears is my second fave female singer, right behind my favourite, Madonna. She's had amazing success worldwide, especially in the US and the UK. Her first ever single, ...Baby One More Time, went straight to #1 in the US and UK, and was a world-wide million seller. The album, ...Baby One More Time, which is also excellent, by the way, has gone 13x Platinum in the US, and has sold 25 million copies worldwide. Britney's second album, Oops!...I Did It Again, which is also brilliant, has sold 10x Platinum in the US; 20 million copies worldwide. Britney returned with her third album, self-titled. I consider it to be Britney's best album, despite lesser success than her first two albums, selling 5x Platinum in the US; 12 million worldwide. <br /> <br />I'M A SLAVE 4 U <br />This is definately one of my fave Britney singles. The song is excellent, and I also love the video! The single hit #4 in the UK, and #27, believe it or not, in the US. (10/10) <br /> <br />OVERPROTECTED <br />Another one of Britney's best singles, all of the singles from this album are Britney's best singles! Overprotected really stands out, it's an amazing song! Charted #4 in UK, #16 in US. (10/10) <br /> <br />LONELY <br />This is yet another brake-up song, but it's better than most of the brake-up songs I've ever heard out there at the moment. This is definately an album high-light for me. (10/10) <br /> <br />I'M NOT A GIRL, NOT YET A WOMAN <br />This single debuted in Britney's big movie CROSSROADS. The single reached #2 in the UK, but was a chart-flop in the US, reaching, deep breath, #102! This one should've really charted alot higher. (10/10) <br /> <br />BOYS <br />This song is brilliant! The Co-ED Remix and the album version are both equally fantastic. The song is very funky, and I love the video. The song charted at #7 in the UK and #122 in the US, another chart-flop, unfortunately. (10/10) <br /> <br />ANTICIPATING <br />Looking at most reviews for this album, people either love this disco-influenced song, or hate it. I LUUUURVE IT! It's definately one of my faves on the album, if not MY FAVE. (10/10) <br /> <br />I LOVE ROCK 'N ROLL <br />Another one of my faves. This song wasn't released as a single worldwide, but hit #13 in the UK. This, and Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know (from Britter's second album Oops!...I Did It Again) are the only singles from Britney not to make the top 10 in the United Kingdom! Well, I love this song, it's one of the best! (10/10) <br /> <br />CINDERELLA <br />Awesome. In this song, Britney talks about how her b/f treats her like Cinderella and how she won't take this crap anymore. It's definately one of the best songs on the album, and yet another I rate 10. Ha-ha! (10/10)  <br /> <br />LET ME BE  <br />This song is good! But if I had to choose a weakest on the album, this song would get it! (9/10) <br /> <br />BOOMBASTIC LOVE <br />This song is a tremendous pop effort. Fantastic! (10/10) <br /> <br />THAT'S WHERE YOU TAKE ME <br />This is a lovely, slow song. Everything is fine, until Britney starts going \\"La La La La\\" etc..., in her baby-like voice! (9/10) <br /> <br />WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME <br />Excellent, great, brilliant. Fantastic closure! (10/10) <br /> <br />Overall, this is an excellent album. It shot to #1 in the US (Britney's third (and not final!!) number one effort in the US), and got #4 in the UK. As I said, it's sold 12 million copies worldwide so far. Let's get it past the 20 million mark like her previous two albums!  <br /> <br />Josh <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

The first song In My Hood is a great start to this c.d. good sample, everything. Then tha next big song is well must of them. I don't really listen to llyod banks cause he's just a punk so I wouldn't know anything about the Disco Inferno rip off. and some of these songs are a lil bit choir for me, I mean this dude calms he'll kill us in a second, then he proves his gangster morrilty by singin. Dude what tha hell. and this wholevideo for every song is a rip off every video is pretty much poorly made. 50 cent you should just stick to rappin, cause your just a sell out. Shoes, cloths, a drik that you can't even find anywhere, a book, a wacth co. and a movie? stick to tha hood sh#t. thats all we need is good rappin, go back to tha power of a dollar, and look at it cause that was rappin. this c.d. is by all means good andshould be added to a c.d. collection, oh and Yo Luda isn't tha king of tha indestry, just tha south, Jay Z is for some gay reason, get that right dips#it

0060555661|4.0|People like Warren Buffett swear by this book. It is a difficult book to read but could be worth the effort. A definitive guide to classical value investing - following this book by Graham would make you the ultimate safe investor. It takes away the charm from playing the stock market game. But hey, we are in it for money, not for charm. And then money has a charm of its own too.  <br />The book is very detailed and I would not suggest it as the first finance/investment book. You might like to read One Up On Wall Street.  <br />

B0009QTS1M|4.0|When I first saw Gladiator in the theater I was somewhat disappointed. Watching it on DVD caused my appreciation for it to grow. It can now be listed among my favorites. So much so that I was very much looking forward to the extended version... til I got it. While the additional minutes add to the story, and make it an even better viewing experience, this movie is also a delight to the ear. That's why I am dismayed by the lack of a DTS soundtrack, which is available on the original DVD release. Why not put each version, theatrical and extended, each on their own disk and give us that remarkable SOUND EXPERIENCE too?

B0000AQS0F|5.0|When Firefly first came out, I didn't watch it because I was already watching too many shows (Buffy, Angel, Star Trek, StarGate, Farscape, and a few others) and I didn't want to add another show to my already full VCR tapes!  Now I am kicking myself for missing out on what was a terrific show! I bought the DVDs this summer right before SciFi announced they were going to air the reruns and at first I was going to just savor the show and watch the SciFi channel versions -- one a week. Well, I couldn't help myself and ran through the DVD set in about 3 weeks. Now I am mourning the show's cancellation just like I did Buffy's and Angel's. But at least we have the movie to look forward to so I can't wait until Sept 30! <br /> <br />I think the show failed on TV because (mostly) Fox Television was stupid to not air the pilot first. Duh!!!  Anyone knows that it is character development and 'secrets' that keeps shows popular not cool action or sets. There was plenty of action in the 2 hour pilot to grab and intrigue the fans while also creating a few 'secrets' to make you come back for more. If you disagree, just think about why a show like Desperate Housewives is so popular -- everyone wants to know what secrets everyone has!  Other than that, the show is just a boring slow moving soap opera! But alas, I still watch DH just for the secrets! :) <br /> <br />I think it's also possible there were a lot of people like me that were fans of Joss' other shows (Buffy, Angel) and couldn't commit to another show or were afraid that maybe it wouldn't be as great as the other two shows so they didn't watch it at all. I didn't know at the time, either, that Joss had contributed so many successful projects (Toy Story, etc.) so I had thought Buffy/Angel was a uniquely successful creation that couldn't be repeated. I am now properly educated and convinced Joss is a genious! :)
B00005JNTX|3.0|\\"Sin City\\" is a piece of art work. There are no other films of which I'm aware that have taken the comic book (or graphic novel) format to the screen with such ingenuity and aplomb as Robert Rodriguez has done with Sin City. <br /> <br />The acting is superb and the action gripping, flowing and beautiful. <br /> <br />The story surrounds three different groups of inhabitants of \\"Sin City\\". We follow a police man (Bruce Willis) in his quest to catch a child molester/killer (Nich Stahl); a parolee (Mickey Rourke) who is set up for having killed a prostitute(Jame King); a group of prostitutes who run a section of Sin City and are headed by Rosario Dawson. The stories all come together, but not in tight neat little bundles as you many be used to. The outcome of this film noir is not necessarily a happy one. <br /> <br />The graphic novel was drawn in black and white with limited usage of color. Rodriguez does the same here. It is absolutely one of the things that makes this film not only unique but gripping. <br /> <br />This is an action film that warrants several viewings simply because you are going to be so caught up in how cool the film looks that you'll lose track of the plot. <br /> <br />Check this one out.

B00009P1O2|5.0|An update:    Reading some of the other reviews, it looks like I might have a different DVD - mine seems to have come from Brazil, is only 80 mins long, has 21 songs and only has one disk. (Maybe that's why it was only $10 Australian!).  Anyway, I continue to love it - I'm driving the family crazy by trying to listen to it all the time - thank goodness for my wireless headphones!      Anyway.. it looks like I might be missing out on some great extra stuff, so I'm off to try to find a Region 4 copy of the one eveyone's talking about!    Original Review:    I'm a prog rock fan (Yes, ELP, Pink Floyd, Genesis.. etc), so I didn't know much about Queen other than Boehemian Rhapsody and Another One Bites the Dust before I got this DVD (OK.. I exaggerate, but I didn't count myself a fan).    Well..I picked this up for a few bucks just as a curiosity and  after looking at, and listening to, this a couple of times, I was hooked.  The atmospherics are fantastic, the sound is excellent and the pure energy and passion of the band just mesmerised me.  Freddie's singing is just electric and he and the band have the HUGE crowd eating out of their hands.  As others have said, it's just like being there and you get a real sense of the excitement and energy of the occasion.    There are a couple of annoying things about the DVD, like the weird video thing that happens during Boehemian Rhapsody, but they're minor.    So, if you've even got only a vague interest in Queen, this DVD will be well worth the investment!
B0009HLDFU|4.0|First, regarding the issue of not being able to RIP the CD-- are you guys 12 years old???  Spend 99 cents and download your favorite songs for your little CD mixes and stop being a bunch of computer dorks.  With that said, this is a great CD that the foo's have put out.  It has a different sound and style of rock then the last 4 dics that have been released, but it is a great new sound.  Songs like \\"Best of You\\", \\"DOA\\", and \\"Resolve\\" are three great reasons to buy this disc.
B00095MLGC|5.0|I've been listening to Porcupine Tree for a while, but I had never heard this album until a few weeks ago, when I found it in a local store, and was thrilled they had something like this.  With the way PT has been progressing, it seems that most people are taking a new interest in the old albums after hearing In Absentia and Deadwing.  If you're here reading this review, then you probably have already gotten the idea that the older music is a much different-sounding Porcupine Tree.  This is definitely not a band that likes to regurgitate the same material on each album.  You can read Steven Wilson's interviews and see that he likes his new albums to reflect the changes that have occured in his life in between the releases.<br /><br />That said, Up the Downstair is more experimental and less heavy than than In Absentia and Deadwing, and falls more under the category of \\"atmospheric head music\\" or \\"space rock.\\"  It is also, in Wilson's own words: \\"...the first Porcupine Tree album proper, in that it was the first to be conceived and recorded as an album project for a record label.\\"<br /><br />..What.you.are.listening.to.are.musicians.performing.psychedelic.music.under.the.influence.of.a.mind-altering.chemical..<br /><br />Standout tracks to me on Up the Downstair include Synesthesia, a trip-hop psychedelic piece, featuring layers upon layers of voices and some really interesting, subtle guitar work. I also love the title track, which reminds me quite a bit of The Sky Moves Sideways.  Small Fish is a shorter, more \\"digestable\\" song, more remnant of their more recent work. It's a great track.<br /><br />This release of Up the Downstair also includes Staircase Infinities, a collection of various songs released pre-Up the Downstair.  As such, they are very varied in style.  Cloud Zero is almost an experimental jazz piece. The Joke's on You is a fabulous song, and I have no way of relating it to their other work. You just have to listen to it.  Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape is another atmospheric piece, like you might expect from Porcupine Tree's earlier work.<br /><br />Steven Wilson's versatility and musical genius shine through on this release.  So open yourself up to hearing something you aren't comfortable with.  The music will take over you in the end.mscape is another atmospheric piece, like you might expect from Porcupine Tree's earlier work. <br /> <br />Steven Wilson's versatility and musical genius shine through on this release.

B000002J1M|5.0|At this point Peter Gabriel's stage persona was becoming increasingly unpredictable.  Genesis had the reputation of being one of the darkest and twisted progressive rock bands of the time.  It's on this album that we get the staples of their amazing live performances. <br /> <br />Watcher of the Skies had actually been the show opener for some time, but did not make it onto Nursery Cryme because of time constraints.  The studio version makes its glorious debut here.  While this version is wonderful, I must admit that the live version available on Live is much better.  The same goes for their stunning magnum opus, Supper's Ready, an epic of biblical proportions.  This song is dark, humorous, and glorious.  It is also the best Genesis song in concert, and had been a show closer for many shows.  Nothing can really top the big finish of Supper's Ready. <br /> <br />The rest of the album is also great.  Get 'em Out By Friday is a pessimistic view of the future and over population.  Time Table is a bit of yearning for medieval times (with plenty of their signature medieval sound to go along with it).  Can Utility and the Coastliners is probably the shortest epic Genesis has written, and features some excellent guitar and keyboard playing by Mr. Hackett and Mr. Banks respectively.  Hackett also gets a beautiful solo moment on the classical guitar piece, Horizons. <br /> <br />But Supper's Ready is where the strength of this album truly lies.  But still, I actually don't think the studio version did the song much justice, it really does stand up much better live (which can be heard on the Archive box set).
B000AYELVK|4.0|Even more so that its predecessor, \\"X2: X-Men United\\" is more of a treat for those of us weaned on Marvel Comics and know the complete back story of every single mutant superhero who pops up through the movie. When Dr. Hank McCoy (Steve Bacic) is shown debating the rights of Mutants on television we recognize he is one of the original merry mutants in yellow spandex, the Beast. During the final shot of the film we nod knowingly because our intimate knowledge of \\"X-Men\\" #101 means we recognize the strange shape and can hazard a pretty good guess as to what happens in the third X-Men movie before the credits even start to roll on this one.<br /><br />This film is better than the first one, which is a very good sign in the world of Hollywood where a sequel is one thing but a franchise is even better. The first time around the X-Men, the good mutants of Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), had to stop Magneto (Ian McKellen) and his bad mutants (the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants for those who know their X-Men lore), although there were humans trying to push a Mutant Registration Act through Congress. This time it is the ordinary humans who are after all the mutants in the world, ironically, by using mutants in the effort. In charge of the effort is General William Stryker (Brian Cox), who has found a means of extracting information from Magneto about Xavier's School for Gifted Children as well as some other ways of allowing him exercise some degree of mind control.<br /><br />The worst thing I can say about \\"X2\\" is that it begins with the best action sequences the entire film. A mutant gets into the White House and goes after the President (Cotter Smith) in the Oval Office. We know that this is Kurt Wagner (Alan Cummings), a.k.a. Nightcrawler, who has the gift of teleportation (apparently without the omnipresent of brimstone this time around). This surprises us because he is one of the \\"good\\" mutants, but the answer will be forthcoming. He is one of the few new characters introduced into the mix and the tatoos they have worked into Nightcrawler's make-up are superb; on the basis of Nightcrawler and Zhaan from \\"Farscape,\\" there simply need to be more blue chracters on television and in the movies.<br /><br />Anyhow, Nightcrawler's attack on the President gives Stryker carte blanche to go after the mutants and his first target is the school in Westchester, New York. When the troops hit Xavier's school is probably the second best action sequence in the film, and we are still only a half hour into the film (the final action sequences has great significance but is considerably less spectacular). For those who remember when Marvel editor Jim Shooter put his foot down about X-Men characters doing any actual killing (e.g., a whole planet of asparagus people), it is rather surprising to see Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) slicing and dicing his way through the shock troops. From that point on the goal is for the X-Men to stay ahead of Stryker's army and try to stop his plan and save mutant-kind.<br /><br />There are echoes of a lot of different epic adventures from the X-Men comic books in this film. The script by Michael Dougherty and Daniel P. Harris is based on a story created by David Hayter, Zak Penn, and director Bryan Singer, who were obviously inspired by the writers (Stan Lee, Len Wein, and Chris Claremont) and artists (Jack Kirby, Dave Cockrum, and John Byrne) of the comic books. There is still Wolverine trying to get between Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and Scott Summers/Cyclopes (James Marsden), as well as the sudden spikes in Jean's powers. Rogue (Anna Paquin) is trying to figure out a way of having the most tentative of physical relationships with Bobby Drake/Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), while John Allerdyce/Pyro (Aaron Stanford) is trying to figure out whether or not he should switch sides. There are a lot of characters being juggled here; Halle Berry has an Oscar and is one of the good mutants, but she does not have much to do exceptexercise her powers to control the weather periodically. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos gets more to do as Mystique, except, of course, you can never tell.<br /><br />Ultimately what makes this film less than perfectlly satisfying is the fact that the nature of the characters compels the writers to create artificial restraints. When Marvel put out the \\"Ultimate X-Men\\" comic books it proved what I had long suspected: that you can really only have one fight between the X-Men and Magneto for all the marbles because as long as he has his helmet on, the Mutant Master of Magneticism is pretty much invincible. This is proven in \\"X2\\" when Magneto finally escape; keep in mind how he does it and then come up with a reason why he does not simply go out and do that to every human being on earth. Similarly, when the troops attack the school, there is more fleeing than fighting, although the tranquillizer darts used by the invaders do not work on the armored Piotr Rasputin/Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) or Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat (Katie Stuart) with her ability to walk through walls. Granted, the important thing is to get the kids to relative safety, but Wolverine does not have to do the Horatio at the bridge act.<br /><br />The key to where the next film can succeed even better is contained in the climax, not only in terms of story of self sacrifice involved but also in the promise of rebirth. In other words, the next time around \\"X-Men\\" can reach operatic heights if they do any justice at all to the Dark Phoenix epic. Cross your fingers, True Believers.do except exercise her powers to control the weather periodically.

B000002J2B|5.0|This marks the end of the first half of Genesis's output. Their seventh album is their last truly great album.  Every song is solid, some are masterpieces.  However, one song, Your Own Special Way, seems rather out of place.  It's the first love ballad by this band, and also the first song one could consider sappy.  While not a bad song, next to rest of the music on this album, it does seem rather weak.  Unfortunately, it was a sign of things to come. <br /> <br />But, everything else on this album is superb.  Eleventh Earl of Mar is a good example of Genesis' electronic vs acoustic veratility.  One For the Vine is another excellent mini-epic centered about a war leader who leads his men to death.  Wot Gorilla is an instrumental, mainly showcasing Tony's exceptional keyboard and synth playing.  All in a Mouse's Night is a funny song (there was usually one or two per album) about the escapades of a house mouse vs a cat, not one of their best, but a good song. <br /> <br />The last four tracks should really considered one epic, and is the last epic masterpiece the band has recorded.  Blood on the Rooftops is a beautiful song and social commentary featuring some excellent Hackett classical guitar playing.  It soons flows into the stunning instrumental tracks 'Unquiet Slumbers for the Sleepers in that Quiet Earth' and culminates into the grand finale, Afterglow, a song which became a staple in live concerts after long and tense instrumental sections.  It's a wonderful end to a wonderful album.
B0009QTS1M|2.0|This Extended Edition is getting 2 stars for the following reasons; cool box, new stuff. However, it fails on the one fact that it is NOT in DTS!!!! The Signature DVD was DTS which came out about 3/4 years ago, why on earth would they re-release Gladiator (for the 4th time) without including the DTS soundtrack. My advice would be to but the signature series if your gonna buy Gladiator, unless you dont want the amazing sound to go with your cool movie.<br />PS. I cant stand when movies are re-released over and over again (Donnie Darko, Army of Darkness, Mallrats,Gladiator.....)Will ther ever be a 'final edition'?
B000002J1L|5.0|The first song on this album is the definitive Genesis song.  Everything they did after this song was, in a way, an extension of what was done in this song.  It has everything: the hypnotic acoustic guitar and flute playing that had become the trademark of Genesis with Anthony Phillips, Mike Rutherford and Peter Gabriel, Phil Collins excellent drumming and angelic backup singing, Steve Hackett's wickedly impressive epic guitar playing, Tony Banks complex chord structures, and Peter Gabriel's dark, powerful, and intensely emotional voice.    It is no surprise that Phillips, Gabriel, Banks, Collins, Hackett, and Rutherford were all involved in writing this song.  It all just seemed to come together so seemlessly with The Musical Box.  It is also probably one of the creepiest songs ever written, and the emotional ending to the song is possibly the best Genesis moment ever.  It was the song that marked the arrival of Genesis as a force to be reckoned with and established their distinct sound.  The definitive five man lineup was completed with this album.    Although the departure of Phillips was a major blow to the band, the replacement they got for him, Steve Hackett, proved to be more than they could have hoped for.  He contributes heavily to the humorous Return of the Giant Hogweed, and The Fountain of Salmacis, two of the best Genesis mini-epics ever written.  The addition of accomplished drummer, Phil Collins, was also a major boost to the bands sound.  His drum technique is top notch, and his high pitched voice was a perfect counterpart to Gabriel's lead.    The rest of this album is also truly great.  Seven Stones is a fantastic song about an old man's method of making decisions.  Harold the Barrel is probably the funniest song they had written about a man threatening to jump from a building's window ledge.  For Absent Friends is a nice little song featuring the debut of Phil Collins as lead vocalist.  And Harlequin is a beautiful song featuring all five membersvoices harmonizing beautifully.  This album is an essential masterpiece.
0140288503|5.0|Black Hawk Down is not just one of the best war books i have ever read, it's one of the best books i have ever read. How Mark Bowden is able to tie both the military points of view to the Somalians point of view, and then add his own opinions into one cohesive story that has flow and at the same time intriguing is beyond my comprehension. His writing not only gives you a historical insight, but an unbiased account of the war. Of course there's no such thing as complete unbiasedness, but Black Hawk Down comes extremely close. It honors America's heroes, and explains the tragedies and the truth of what went on in Mogadishu. Bravo Mark Bowden.
B000002J2D|3.0|This is their first album as a trio, hence the title.  Their guitarist, Steve Hackett, had left because he felt not enough of his music was getting on the albums.  He had already had some success with his first album, 'The Voyage of the Acolyte', and left Genesis to continue his solo career. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, with his departure a lot of the magic sound that had made Genesis a great band had also departed.  Many point to the departure of Gabriel as being the major turning point.  And it is true to an extent, because with the departure of Gabriel, the lyrics were never quite as good, and the emotional power of Gabriel's voice was also lost forever.  But Steve Hackett's epic mysticism was still with Genesis, and I believe he comes from the same place musically as Peter Gabriel does.  Lose one, and the magic is still there in some form, but lose two, and you wind up with trio Genesis. <br /> <br />So what is trio Genesis?  Keyboardist Tony Banks, who had been the principle composer, was always the brains of the group.  Guitarist Mike Rutherford's strength lied more in the melodic aspect.  And drummer/singer Phil Collins brought a technical proficiency to the band that was unmatched by most other drummers out there, and he also had a very good singing voice.  But without Steve Hackett and Peter Gabriel, the band lost a lot of its heart and mystical sound.  As a result, this album has a very stripped down sound. <br /> <br />There is very little acoustic playing on this album.  No more classical guitar pieces, and very little piano.  Tony also stopped using the mellotron, which had a very medieval and eary sound that really made the previous music sound truly epic.  The band were obviously moving away from the long epics in favor of shorter, more to the point songs.  As a result the stuff that made the music interesting is gone, and replaced by just the bare bones. <br /> <br />Songs like Down and Out, The Ballad of Big, and The Lady Lies are great examples of this stripped down sound done very well.  The playing and technical ability of these three is, as always, top notch, and it shows on this album, in particular on Down and Out and The Lady Lies.  Snowbound is also a nice soft song, reminiscent Ripples..., but without the beautiful piano interlude.  And Follow You Follow Me is also nice song that proved to be their first #1 hit. <br /> <br />The problem with the album is that it is too much of the same.  By stripping down the songs, they stripped away a lot of what made the old stuff so interesting to listen to.  By the time you get to side two of the album, the album's synth dominated sound is already starting to get wearisome.  Without a break from the electronics into more traditional sounds, it simply becomes too synthetic sounding, and not as organic and emotional as their older stuff. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, it's hard to say this is a bad album.  In fact, it works very well in small doses.  Some tracks, namely Many to Many, Undertow and even the minor hit, Say it's Alright Joe, are somewhat weak and although not bad, feel more like filler.  The rest, while ranging from fair to really good, suffer by being on the same album.  It's too much of the same synth textures, and it grows tiring.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|My whole family loves this film.  I just introduced it to my son, Tyler, who cried at the end.  Such a moving film that really tugs at your \\"heart light.\\"  This is a classic that young children should get to see, at least on video.  I hope that they re-release this soon to watch it on the big screen.  My son now wants an E.T. action figure. Get this on DVD not VHS!
B0007SMD3W|4.0|Ah, their first.  It has been re-released many times with different songs, but it is important to know that the original album contained only the following songs:    Where The Sour Turns to Sweet  In The Beginning  Fireside Song  The Serpent  Am I Very Wrong?  In the Wilderness  The Conqueror  In Hiding  One Day  Window  In Limbo  Silent Sun  A Place to Call My Own    This concept album is the band's interpretation of the book of Genesis.  Yes, the bible book.  It was actually written by Peter Gabriel, Tony Banks, Anthony Phillips, and Mike Rutherford when they were still in highschool.  Many were developed from earlier songs and rewritten to fit the bible theme.  It's clear that they were influenced by The Moody Blues concept album \\"Days of Future Past\\", as the sound is often very similar.  There is also quite a bit of BeeGees influence heard on this album, as evidenced by the their first single in 1968, The Silent Sun.    Perhaps if this album came out a few years earlier, it would have been a smash hit.  As it stands, it does sound a bit dated, and probably sounded so even then.  By 1969, this sort of brit pop was going out of style.  Even so, there are some very original things on this album.  First and foremost is the primary use of the piano and the acoustic guitar over electric instruments.  It is heavily reliant on chord structures rather than riffs, as Genesis music tends to be from their first album to their last.  Gabriel's voice is also very distinctive, although he sings much more softly and more reserved on this album than we're used to hearing.  But it's clear, even at this early point, that there is something very special to that voice of his.    Don't expect something like Selling England by the Pound when you hear this album.  What you have here is a very young band with very little experience but a lot of good ideas that don't quite come out as well as they could have.  Nevertheless, the brilliance is there, the band just isn't experienced enoughto pull it off as professionally as they would later be able to.    It's still a very pleasant album, and with this edition you get more songs from their early recording days from 1967-1969.
014118213X|4.0|I read \\"Howard End\\" about a month ago. I chose this book because of its attactive and classic cover which is out standing. I quite like it because the author had shown the real representation of British society that classified to upper, middle and lower class society. It has specific manner and life style which is absolutely different in each of the classes. The viewpoint of this book is to sympathize the poor, keep a promise, good deed procreate good returns and bad deed also procreate bad returns, which I have learnt so much from this book.
B0009P42S2|5.0|One reason for hating this movie would be the dub. It's one of the worst I've heard in a long time. DO NOT WATCH THE DUB! Especially for your first viewing. Roger Ebert gave this a negative review (after watching the dub) for having a nonsensical storyline. Well, the subbed version I saw in the theatre (Im lucky enough to live in a city where it played), made lots of sense and was actually quite simple. It's a story about science, more specifically energy, and how to use it. Different ideologies are represented by different characters. Eventually these opinions manifest into physical action, in a battle, and the film ends with what I can only describe as the opposite of a big explosion! Cool! Original!<br /><br />Having said that, this film (like Akira) is not really about story and characters. This film is a singular, visual statement. Like Michelangelo's David. It amazes me how many people don't get this! Akira is a statement about the \\"End of the World\\" mentality many post WW2 young japanese men felt (and still do), as a result of the bomb, rapidly advancing technology and a long history of violent earthquakes. It's about the rebuilding of Tokyo. Steamboy is the same way. The story and the characters are just tools for Otomo to express his statement.<br /><br />And finally the animation. I can say without a doubt that this is THE BEST ANIMATION I have ever seen! It is so clean, so technically perfect, so intricate, and so consistant I can't believe human hands achieved it. I think it is so flawless people accept it and begin to underappreciate it. If you claim to have respect for 2D animation there is simply no way to not like this film.
0385336810|3.0|I admit that I haven't finished \\"can you keep a secret\\" yet, but already I am missing the funny, hilarious, quirky and frankly darling Becky Bloomwood... Emma is surely more sensible than Becky but much less credible!  <br /> <br />I certainly believe there are far more Rebeccas out there capable of spending 120 pounds on a silk scarf while already having a 2000 pound overdraft than Emmas capable of rattling their innermost secrets on a plane to a complete stranger. And definetly more Luke Brandons falling in love during a press conference with the nutty journalist who's asking for 20 quid for \\"her aunt's funeral\\" than  Jack Harper's out there falling in love with the deranged weirdo sitting next to him on a plane telling him she's never found her G-spot.  <br /> <br />I like Sohpie Kinsella very much and I read the first three Shopaholic books in less than a week, but I just can't seem to quite enjoy \\"can you keep a secret\\" as much.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Now, trust me... I still dont like this album, but I am extremely biased. I do have to say, though, that I respect the Beach Boys for their hard work and effort to create an album that many of their fans liked (considering other Beach Boys material, I can see why they liked it). <br /> <br />If you don't like the Beach Boys, that's okay, but if you do, I would reccomend this album to all of you.
0553260111|1.0|I think that this is possibly one of the first times I've enjoyed the movie more than the book.  It seemed to have potential at the start, but it quickly died when the pace of the book quickened to the lead character constantly dodging would-be killers.  And there were a lot of them.  My skepticism turned to disbelief when Bourne kidnaps a female to aid in his escape from even more people that are trying to kill him.  After threatening her life and inflicting pain on her mulitple times to keep her near, he's essentially turned her life upside down and convinced her she might die.  So how does she respond?  She falls in love with him.  Not sure if I've ever witnessed a quicker transition from total hatred for your potential killer to unconditional love (openly professing their love for each other on a routine basis).  In a matter of about 70 pages she goes from being utterly terrified of him and turning him into the police (or who she thinks is the police) to this: \\"I should throw you out,\\" he said.  \\"I should tell you to get out of my life.\\"  She replies: \\"It wouldn't make any difference if you did.  I wouldn't go, my love.\\"  Yeah, that's believable. <br /> <br />This book suffered because of Ludlums strange priorities.  When the book was fast paced, it was also quite shallow and superficial, barely holding my interest.  When the book focused more what should have been the interesting parts, it slowed down considerably, barely holding my interest.  And there is Ludlums thing with printing snippets of other languages.  Not a bad thing if you know what he's talking about.  But he did it with both German (which I speak) and French (lots and lots of French, which I don't speak) and it just left you confused and bored. <br /> <br />This was my second and last book by Ludlum.  The first book I read was less than impressive and this one was just laughable.
B0009VRHLK|4.0|Vincent Gallo has come up with a \\"in your face\\" docu-drama, kind of an alligorical case history of depression, boredom, and yes, sexual freedom never quite aquired in mainstream cinema. The film seems to work no matter what ones feelings are for it. In a maze of films where people have their heads blown off every 10 seconds, THE BROWN BUNNY comes through cheap,fast and thought prevoking. Vincent you have BALLS!!!!!
B00003CXTG|1.0|Let's face it. <br />I see in the movie American navys losing thier lives trapped in the sinking ships, the female characters missing their loved ones, and suffering from the pain of death and the fear accompaning it.  It is truly heart-breaking to see those in such agony.   <br />But, we must remember how many Indians and African slaves were killed by Americans during 17 - 19th century.   <br />What if the Indians and the Africans slaves had had an advanced technology and made their sufferings into a movie like Pearl horbor? - depicting Millions of Indians including infants and pregnant womens being kileed American soldires and African slaves being apart from their homeland and killed by thier masters without doning anything wrong. Our heart must have had been broken to see Indians and African slaves losing their lives in the fate which was not their choice <br /> <br />Know this fact - we tend to magnigy what we can see ourselves, expecially though a vivid visual-image made by a high-technology, and tend to neglect what we were not able to see due to the lack of availbility of such tech.  .  <br /> <br />Know another fact - WHO can have such tech and the capital that can afford it?  It is Hoywood movie indutury.  <br /> <br />Looks like it is one who have money that can CREATE truth and circulate it throught the world making it natural and self-evident. <br /> <br />Please, please, please <br />don't mix what is real with that which is made up at the mercy of money and high-tech. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'll admit, I watched the first episode shown on FOX during it's inital airing and didn't think it was that good but this of course was not the original pilot made so the show didn't make much sense to me. Flash forward three years and I am a convert. I think after hearing that people were lining up for the pre screenings of the movie and hearing how dedicated all the fans were made me really curious. I think, always in the back of my mind, I thought that it couldn't be that bad if the name Whedon was on it. Having been a fan of Buffy and Angel for years, and loving them, and him delivering some of my favorite TV over the years, my curiosity got the best of me and boy am I glad it did.<br /><br />I watched the first two or three episodes and enjoyed it but it wasn't until about the 4th episode it really started to gel and show just how well written, dramatic and at times funny this show was. The mix of the character and interplay was very Whedon which made me want to watch more and more until I was finished within two weeks.<br /><br />The only bad thing? No more episodes to see how these characters grow.<br /><br />The good part, at least we get a Serenity movie.<br /><br />So now I can experience the rage that all fans felt when FOX yanked it prematurely from everyones living rooms. When will they learn that you have to nuture a show and give it a fair shot?????

B00004W50Z|5.0|Contrary to popular belief, The Band didn't lose it after their magnificent self-titled second album. The third, STAGE FRIGHT, is just as good. It starts off on a high note with \\"Strawberry Wine\\", and then keeps up speed and keeps it up for the rest of the CD. One of the CD's defining moments is the parable \\"Daniel And The Sacred Harp\\", which tells the story of a young man who sells his soul in order to get a precious harp, but the song is really an allegory about being conned into ANYTHING unhealthy. In fact, the entire album is basically an allegory about the self-abuse that was plaguing the band members at the time, pianist/vocalist Richard Manuel in particular, and the general sense of hopelessness present on all of the album's songs makes me glad that I have lots of photos of pretty actresses to serve as a deterrent to these excesses, especially since those behaviors killed both Manuel (in 1986) and bassist/vocalist Rick Danko (in 1999). The fact that the surviving members advocate sanctions on Indonesia in retaliation for that country's recent trumped-up drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist makes this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
B000007MVM|3.0|Either that or some other Pink Floyd record I can only assume. Otherwise you are here by mistake. Turn back... Ok listen to me now, If you are here only because you've heard of Syd and have never actually heard his Pink Floyd record \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" you really need to hear that first. Stop reading this and go check that album out. I don't like to push Syd Barrett onto people, I think he's a genius, but most people tell me (and sometimes i belive...) that you need to be into*'cid* before you can be into syd. You dig that? If not, than maybe you should turn around now....<br />Ok you are still here. Well, what were we talking about? Oh yeah, THE MADCAP LAUGHS, Syd Barretts first solo project.  This was recorded shortly after he was kicked out of Pink Floyd, the band which he founded, due to the fact that he was completley out of his mind on LSD. You have to keep this in mind before going the mile to pick up this album. LSD was the creative fuel for Syd while making PIPER, but if you know anything about LSD as a creative fuel you know it peaks somewhere and then crashes hard. Usually leaving it's victims highly confused and disoriented. Syd Barrett was more than just a classic case of this, in his case it can be considered tragic. You probably already know this story so I'll get to MADCAP LAUGHS.<br /><br />I like some of this album lots and some of this album nots. You like that. Hey, I'm Syd Barrett here! No, seriously though, some of this album is complete crap and I can't give it no five stars. I give it three because three is my lucky number and somehow I feel that I need to give SYD that number due to the strange cosmic connection that I feel towards him.<br />That being said allow me to focus on the high points(which there are plenty of...)<br />The first track TERRAPIN is the best song production wise. It sounds like it could have actually come from a Pink Floyd album. It's slow and strange and that's how we like it. This is probably also the most well known Syd solo track, due to the fact that PHISH used to cover it.<br />After the first song the production gradually goes down hill, as if the track order was based on tracks that came together great to tracks where SYD completley forgot what he was doing and just stared plucking at random things on his Git what.<br />The second track NO GOOD TRYING doesn't suffer much, still solid SYD. LOVE YOU isn't bad but it's a little fruity.<br />NO MANS LAND is my favorite. It's a ton of chaos and a ton of beauty put together. I don't know if this was an accident or he meant it to come out this way but the track is brilliant. Worth the album just for this track. I'd even go so far to say better than PIPER stuff. NO MANS LAND is awesome.<br />Ok, next is HERE I GO. I enjoy this song a lot too. It's about having a crappy girlfriend who you just can't stand and then going to her house and hooking up with her sister. Very nice. Always makes me smile.<br />OCTOPUSS is after that and this too is a good tune. I have no idea what about but that never has been a big deal in SYDWORLD.<br />The next song is junk, and most of the songs fall apart from there. It's kind of sad actually to virtually listen to the mans decline.  LONG GONE the last good one and we might be able to use those lyrics to describe the end. \\"No one understands why for so long you have been gone.\\"lo track, due to the fact that PHISH used to cover it.

0792833201|1.0|I rented this from Blockbuster and it was rated PG. I fell for it. I thought it would still be bloody and gory. Yep, I fell for it. Maybe if I saw the rated R one there will be a lot more blood and gore and killing!! Not a good movie.
0393317552|4.0|For what it's worth, don't watch the TV series.  It's interesting enough i suppose but the author insisted on being the narrator/presenter and it just comes across as some big hubris piece.  Lots of endless repetition.  The book itself is fascinating and worth your attention
0767020308|5.0|This is my favorite version of the three \\"Emma\\" movies I have watched.  This version portrays most of the characters the way they are portrayed in the book, and spends a lot of time on each of the different characters.   <br />Although I very much like the version with Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam also, it focused most attention on Emma Woodhouse, Mr. Knightley, and Harriet Smith only.  The other characters fell a little bit into the background, in my opinion, even though their characters are so enjoyable and interesting in the book. <br /> <br />In this version with Kate Beckinsdale we get to know the other characters as well and it makes the movie more intriguing.  A job well done!
B000A59PMO|5.0|one of the BEST shows i've seen in a while, i'm completely obsessed-if you haven't watched it yet, get the dvd and catch up, it's worth it!!
0312965788|5.0|James Herriot's books are just plain wonderful.  I own them all and have read them again and again.  I must say, though, this is my favorite.  I've seen a bit of the BBC series and it doesn't do the books justice.  Herriot draws you into his world and makes it come alive in a way that is truly remarkable.  I have ZERO experience with this time period or with veterinary medicine, yet, I find Herriot's descriptions of and insights into his world uplifting and fascinating.  Buy the whole set, and don't miss his adaptations for children.  (The heavy drinking and womanizing of some of the characters make the originals inappropriate for very young readers.)
B0008ENHTE|4.0|This review is for the 2005 Warner Brothers Two-Disc Special Edition DVD.     The synopsis of this film revolves around a mobster named Johnny Ross who flees Chicago after embezzling $2 million from a crime syndicate and goes to San Francisco to testify for a power-driven politician named Walter Chalmers (Robert Vaughn).  Police Lt. Frank Bullit (Steve McQueen) is assigned to protect Ross for several days prior to testifying.  Two hitmen manage to shoot Ross and this sets up the remainder of the movie where Bullit has to not only find these killers but has to appease Chalmers and Bullit's bosses in the police department since he was accountable for Ross's protection.     The signature of this film is of course the wild and fast chase between Bullit's '68 Mustang and the killers' Dodge Charger through the hilly streets of San Francisco.  By today's Hollywood standards it's a very ordinary chase, but in its day, it was clearly a revolutionary segment.  There were obviously car chases in movies prior to this film, but this chase brought filmmaking to a much higher energy level.  But the film has more to offer than just a memorable high-speed chase.  First, the character of Bullit played by McQueen is arguably the first of many to follow of young, stylish, and radical cops that a young generation could identify with.  It's the coolness of McQueen under fire, his style of fast cars, a sexy girlfriend and fashionable clothes that elevate him above the typical suit-and-tie, family man, and vocally brash movie cops of the past.    The other strength of the movie is that it does have a clever twist in the plot about two-thirds through the film.  Another enjoyable aspect of the movie is the setting of urban San Francisco in the late `60's.  We don't see hippies per se, but we do see professional people in \\"mod\\" clothes.  Probably the best example of this historic era of fashion disaster is in a scene where Bullit meets an informant name Eddy who has a custom trimmed beard, trendy glasses, and a loud suit.    As for the DVD, the color picture is sharp and pristine and the audio is excellent.   There are plenty of bonuses including a short feature of the filming of Bullet, the history of editing and the best feature by far, a comprehensive film biography of McQueen entitled, \\"The Essence of Cool\\".  There is also real-time commentary by director Peter Yates.      Movie: B+    DVD Quality: A
B00005221M|5.0|It is a fine blend of meaningful script, wonderful acting (all of the cast), breathtaking cinematography, magical soundtrack and a memorable performance of Daniel Day-Lewis. I admire all his portrayals from Alexander Moor (How Many Miles To Babylon) to the unforgettable Gerry Conlon (In The Name Of The Father). They are all masterpieces but Hawkaye is extra special. He brings out the best of the great actor Daniel Day-Lewis and the best of his charismatic personality. The result is absolutely amazing.

Hugh is no exception, he's slimy, a good con man.  He does play gay rather well which makes you wonder. No wonder the world thinks Americans are stupid.

Great great show!!! <br /> <br />As far as the events of 08/20/05, so what if Bruce was making his thoughts known. He always has, always will! Sharon Osbourne is a spoiled brat, and needs to realize she is not the only person in this business. In fact, every other band she's managed has fired her at one point including her own daughter! <br /> <br />Anyway, the events and behavior of the Ozzfest road crew, bands, and mgt. was totally unprofessional, and an apology should be issued!

B00005JNTX|5.0|The most faithful comic to film adaptation of all time, Frank Miller's Sin City is brilliantly realized by maverick director Robert Rodriguez, combining Miller's gritty and pulpy stories (The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard) with completely rendered, digital backgrounds.  The three stories, although separate, are meticulously intertwined, and brilliantly brought to the screen with one of the biggest casts ever assembled for a comic to film adaptation.  Disfigured tough guy Marv (Mickey Rourke, perfectly cast), uncovering a plot orchestrated by a sinister cardinal (Rutger Hauer) while tracking down the cannibalistic killer (Elijah Wood, unbelievably creepy) and seeking revenge for the death of his true love (Jamie King).  Then, there is Dwight (Clive Owen), a good guy at the wrong place at the wrong time.  His efforts to stop the violent ex-boyfriend (Benicio Del Toro) of a barmaid (Brittany Murphy) goes horribly wrong, and leads to a showdown with the girls of Old Town, and a stunner of a revelation that promises blood flowing in the streets.  The final story revolves around old cop John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) and his attempt to take down a psychopath (Nick Stahl) who kidnapped a little girl, but he himself ends up in jail.  Eight years later, Hartigan gets his chance to save her again (Jessica Alba, hot as ever) in a climactic showdown with a yellow skinned psychopath.  The casting is excellent for the most part, including Rourke, Owen, and Del Toro perfectly cast as Marv, Dwight, and Jackie Boy respectively.  The rest of the cast, including Rosario Dawson, Michael Madsen, Josh Hartnett, Powers Boothe, Michael Clarke Duncan, Devin Aoki, Carla Gugino, Alexis Bledel, Nicky Katt, and even Miller himself, give memorable performances.  Rodriguez (who shares the directing credit with Miller, and Quentin Tarantino even helms a scene as well) uses the comics as directly as possible: from using Miller's art as storyboards to using the dialogue almost exactly, Sin City is easily the most faithful comic adaptation of all time.  Brilliant, brutal, and breathtaking, Sin City is a masterpiece.t exactly, Sin City is easily the most faithful comic adaptation of all time.

0151008116|4.0|Although I enjoyed this book I found some areas of the novel a bit slow paced but I think that was the ultimate goal of the author's:to feel as Pi does floating around the ocean for months.  However, the parts that were exciting compensated and would keep one reading for more.  the ending is excellent and now want to read Life of Pi again to put the clues together.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|An excellent compillation that should please die hard and casual fans.  The easilly blows the single disc Greatest Hits out the water.  With 36 songs on 2 cd's not much missing on here except I would have included the live version of Oh Well (Lindey Buckingham on vocals) and taken off What Makes You Think Tour The One, but would'nt really change anything else. A real plus was the inclusion of the full Length version of Sara and Silver Springs.  I would have to totally agree with previous reviewer that we need a best of early years to get Oh Well, Hypnotized, Black Magic Woman (actually a Mac tune, Santana more well known for it).

Here is a chance to follow an autistic teenager on his brave quest for answers as he leaves his suburban neighborhood,for the first time, for London.      Well written(I felt like I was there w/Christopher),  this book educates the reader as well as entertains.  It's funny, sad and real.

0143034901|5.0|So many have likened THE SHADOW OF THE WIND to a few other books (BARK OF THE DOGWOOD was one, though I don't know why-another was ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE), that I had to check it out.  Turns out that, while it does have excellent writing styles like those novels, the similarities end there. The plot is great:  When Daniel is still a child, his father takes him to the Cemetary of Forgotten Books, a mysterious labyrinthine library filled with books from well-known novels to those that have faded into obscurity. He chooses a novel called &quot;The Shadow of the Wind&quot; by Julian Carax, a writer of dark melodramas that never sold more than 100 copies. In the two decades since Carax's novels appeared in the 1920s and 1930s, they had gained a cult following in Barcelona, where Carax was raised and Daniel lives with his widowed father. Daniel vows to protect and cherish the novel so that it won't be totally forgotten. The plot is dense, the characters are very well developed, and the book is gripping from the very first page, such that you won't put it down until you have read the last sentence on the very last page. you cant get enough of the story, you keep on reading until your eyes are dry and hurt, but you wont put the book down. this is one of the books that I will likely read a second and maybe a third time. honestly, I think this is the best book I have ever read, certainly one of the best five books. the sad thing is, once you finish it, you are certain that the next book you will read will not be as good, and the one after neither. It is a jewel.  Must also recommend THE CHILDREN'S CORNER by McCrae as another great read-very short but packed with punches.
0380789019|5.0|A good friend turned me on Neil's work and I'm going for all I can find. I absolutly treasured this book. I still love classic horror's such as King, Koontz, Rice, Hitchcock and so on. But this was very refreshing with am imagination rivaled only by my own. I usually read during lunch break and a little before bed.  Going through a book or 2 in a month. I plowed through this and American Gods in 2 weeks. If you are thinking of reading this book. I suggest you dont think... GET IT NOW!!! You will love it!!!
0345440900|2.0|Some of the information like what a hungry cry vs. a wet diaper cry was sort of helpful, except that her description of an overtired cry was that same as for hungry and then she talks about how overtired is often misinterpreted for hunger - duh! <br /> <br />Also, my son was unable to breastfeed, Tracy Hogg states that it's impossible to pump exclusivly for longer than about 5 weeks - Well, to use her word - Hogwash!!!.  I made it to three months with no drop in milk production (mind you I never produced enough for my son to have 100% breastmilk, but I never dried up), but I spent a lot of time up to the 5 week mark stressing about it.   <br /> <br />Plus, not being able to follow her EASY program, made me feel pretty inept, which as a lot of new parents know, you don't need help to feel like you're not up to the task sometimes :-)
B000A39FHQ|5.0|I was hesitant at first to buy this cd but I bought it and I was soooo pleased with it. I have bought this cd 3 times! Since I bought it when it came out. Then I saw an import with a bonus track and then I saw this JAPANESE IMPORT. It has 14 tracks and a dvd! Track List: <br />1) Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine  <br />[4/5 the lyrics repeat alot, it's still good] <br />2) Mr. Brightside  <br />[4/5 *it got boring after so much play*] <br />3) Smile Like You Mean It  <br />[5/5 GREAT SONG! Coming of age/maturity song] <br />4) Somebody Told Me <br />[4/5 It also got boring after every radio station played it every 5 minutes] <br />5) All These Things That I've Done <br />[5/5 It starts off as a slow melancholic song but then it changes into a harder song with a great message and a big plus for the choir singing near the end] <br />6) Andy, You're A Star <br />[5/5 It's got a double meanning to it since most gay men love it, but it's not just gay oriented; it's also about friends being jealous and feeling left out] <br />7) On Top  <br />[4/5 It starts off with a synthesizer sounding like a fart at times but turns into a harder song with a techno-ish feeling to it and talks about probably a vacation in RIO DE JANEIRO. The lyrics repeat alot] <br />8) Change Your Mind <br />[5/5 It's a great heart-ache / hope song] <br />9) Believe Me Natalie <br />[5/5 This song is calm and soothing, everytime I hear it I envision a girl dancing around a fiel with a hankerchief swinging from her hand and it makes me smile and breaks my heart everytime I hear it] <br />10) Midnight Show <br />[3.5/5 This is the only song from this album that I think needed a little bit more working on. The choruses are great but some lyrics don't fit in with the song.] <br />11) Everything Will Be Alright <br />[5/5 This is the slowest song on the album and it is a great \\"Have hope, everything changes\\" song] <br />12* Glamorous Indie Rock & Roll <br />[3/5 This song would have been better off as a B-Side since it doesn't show their true potential but when you think of it, it is meant to sound INDIE] <br />13* The Ballad Of Michael Valentine <br />[4/5 As this song begins it reminds me of THE BEATLES and it's sort of slow and it sounds like they were playing live so the vocals sound not as good as they should] <br />14* Under The Gun <br />[4/5 I gave this song 4 because it is a bit TOO loud when it begins and it's quite annoying but once it's by the 3 second everyhthing is cool and it's a great lyrical poem] <br /> <br />The dvd has all the videos and the un-seen version of \\"Mr. Brightside\\" all the videos are great. <br /> <br />Over all it's a great buy!

B0000W3YIS|4.0|Definitely Britney's most mature and least pop album to date. I agree with another reviewer regarding the Kylie/Madonna-ray-of-light feel to this album (at least to a lot of its songs)...Breathe on Me for one. Great dance album (Toxic, Me Against the Music), some more \\"urban\\" tracks, Hookup, for one. Overall pretty good music, catchy and fun, not a lot of depth (but who was expecting depth from a Britney Spears album?). A couple of disappointing songs--Brave New Girl and Touch of My Hand (besides its \\"mature\\" theme, the melody/lyrics weren't that great either).

B0001HAHXW|5.0|I don't know what you guys want out of Eric. But if you want to hear him in his strong suit (Blues/Rock), you got it right here.<br /><br />A spotlight reviewer claimed he \\"Isn't playing like his life depended on it.\\" Listen to the intensity of tracks like Milkcow's Calf Blues, Kind Hearted Woman Blues and Hell Hound on My Trail - he is. That same reviewer said Eric's been bored for the last ten years or so. No. Take They're Red Hot, an uptempo, fun, piano-driven blues song. Same with 32-20 Blues. Billy Preston plays a mean piano, and this album is no exception. Traveling Riverside Blues packs a mean punch, being the best. Stop Breaking Down and Love in Vain have been used by the Rolling Stones already, but Eric puts new life into them. Eric's vocal performance - slightly drunken, barely intelligable - fits perfectly for Little Queen of Spades. The only weak track: If I Had Possesion Over Judgement Day. My only problem is he left some good Robert Johnson tunes untouched: Dust My Broom, Sweet Home Chicago (although he isn't from Chicago, so I'll forgive that), Stones in My Passway and Crossroads (Which he played with Cream in the first place).<br /><br />If you're looking for something like, say, 461 Ocean Blvd. or Cream's Disraeli Gears, buy those. But stop being so harsh towards a good album.
0061015725|3.0|Once again, Michael Crichton uses one of his plots to warn human civilization against the evil that can possibly come from new technology that we don't fully understand. He did it in the excellent \\"Jurassic Park\\" - his best book so far, in my opinion - and in \\"Sphere\\". But now the results are far from what I expected.<br /><br />This time it's nanotechnology instead of DNA manipulation and dinosaurs. There is a close environment, also an island of sorts, an isolated facility in the middle of the Nevada desert. The villains of the story are swarms of nano-entities that were supposedly intended to help during medical procedures; but these swarms, whose behaviour is dictated by a computer code, have evolved and ran away on their own. Nobody knows how they did it and nobody knows what they'll be capable of. A group of scientist and computer wizzards are called to get them back before God only knows what kind of destruction the evil swarms are planning to do.<br /><br />Nanotechnology is fascinating, but Crichton's book is not. Crichton recently seems to be suffering from johngrishamnitis, a disease that attacks the creative part of authors that used be great a little while ago. \\"Prey\\"'s plot is very thin, the characters were all the same to me - divided between the good ones and the bad ones - and all that happens in the book seems to follow a mediochre hollywood script. Sure, there are thrilling parts and chapters in the story, but I knw from experience that Crichton can do way better than this.<br /><br />Anyway, a fast, mildly entertaining read - perfect for a long flight or a lazy day at the beach.<br /><br />Grade 6.0/10
B0007GAEW6|1.0|Seriously. I bought it for $8 thinking 'what the hell?'. I'm big on post-rock and ambient. Reading these reviews I was hoping for something in that vein. I'm Texan, too.  <br />Hearing it, my expectations were proven wrong. Okay. That's fine. Good music is good music.  <br />Then I didn't like it and listened to it again. Still bad.  <br />I've listened to it three times all the way through, pieces more, and it's still not doing it.  <br />I'm inclined to not listen to it anymore. It completely lacks spirit, and, simply, doesn't work on every level.  <br />I've never been a fan of 'prog', so-called, though.

T This a classic well done and emotional album that will leave you thinking what was going on in his mind and soul during this.

Celine Dion, boybands, reality star's records, and of course, this obnoxious group.<br /><br />Where to start?  What exactly is SO bad about them that they've ended up on The Curmudgeons' hit list? Well, let's start with the lead singer, an annoying little bendy, squaking gimp who sounds like he should be a voice character actor on The Muppets.<br /><br />Maybe the songs? Beyond irritating, radio friendly drivel (apart from the bewilderingly popular \\"She Will Be Loved\\").<br /><br />That's another good point - THAT song. OK, if you've never heard it, imagine a really, really high voice. Not in a good way like, say, Prince, but in a \\"finger nails down a blackboard\\" kind of way. OK, got that voice in your head?

B000301YY8|5.0|Heard this album in London a few months ago, just as it was taking Britain by storm.  Nice mix of ballads and catchy tunes that listeners can relate to.  Blunt's lyrics often seem like poems put to music rather than just songs.  Especially moving is &quot;No Bravery,&quot; about a soldier's experience in war.  &quot;Goodbye my Lover&quot; will hit home for listeners nursing broken hearts.  And probably everyone can relate to the episode described in the chart-topping &quot;You're Beautiful.&quot; Best of all - you can actually understand the lyrics when they are sung!
037593460X|5.0|This story is about the adventure of little Charlie Bucket. a very poor boy who lived with his parents and four grandparents. His family was very poor so that they could buy a bar of chocolate only on Charlie's Birthday. What tortured little Charlie more than anything else was that he lived in the same town as an enormous chocolate factory ran by Mr.Willy Wonka, a magical chocolate and candies maker. For the first time, Mr.Willy Wonka announced to open his factory to five lucky children and Charlie was one of them. Inside the factory was an amazing world to everyone. It was full of magical and wonders. Then the adventure begun. <br />  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a wonderful book. I believe that this book can make everybody smiles and enjoys the adventure. You can not predict what is going on in the next chapter because of the twists and turns. And most of all, it is an unforgettable master piece of Roald Dahl, master of children literature.
B0009UC7H0|3.0|The ability to apply several different concepts into a film requires much skill, as Steven Spielberg does in his Raiders of the Lost Arc (1981), or as Sam Raimi does in his Spider-Man (2002).  Adventure, suspense, comedy, and drama combined into a mix where one single person carries out breathtaking tasks with ease which is a difficult tightrope-balancing act for a director.  The director must juggle several different cinematic elements precisely in order to please a tough audience.  If the director slips, a long fall awaits the director ending with a rough landing.  Sahara tries to deliver such an experience with heroic deeds that deliver action, drama, comedy, and suspense in order to entertain the audience.<br /><br />At the end of the Civil War when Richmond, Virginia, is under attack the ironclad ship Texas is about to embark.  Before the ship is leaving, some Confederate soldiers are loading it with heavy metal boxes, which suggestively contain gold.  The opening with the Texas presents a special effect spectacle where thundering cannons spew out flaming balls at the evading Texas, which also continues throughout the film.  Stealthy the Texas attempts to run the Union blockade by slipping into the night like a submarine on stealth mode eluding the enemy's grasp.  The Texas set up will lead the audience on a treasure hunt in modern times where the story's hero with the absurdly over the top name, Dirk Pitt, ventures into the Western Africa.<br /><br />The opening credits, which follow the Texas escape, provide a quick and intricate character development of Dirk (Matthew McConaughey) and his best friend, Al Giordino (Steve Zahn), through the mise-en-scene.  The mise-en-scene reveals that Dirk and Al have spent most of their existing lives together.  They have gone through childhood, Navy Seals training, and are currently working together for NUMA where they salvage shipwrecks.  The relationship between Dirk and Al is always tense; much like a relationship between a bickering married couple.  This of course adds a lot of heartwarming humor to the film.  Matthew McConaughey's performance as Dirk is actually very good and fits the spirit of the film, as Steve Zahn contrasts McConaughey's character very well.  Dirk is the hero who always sees the glass half full while his partner in crime is a clear opposite.<br /><br />Dirk and Al are on an assignment in Western Africa for NUMA when Dirk discovers an important clue to the whereabouts of the Texas, which he has been seeking for a very long time.  This notion of the obsessive seeking for a treasure is not a new concept, as Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) and National Treasure (2004) depict the same obsessive search.  These two goofs, Dirk and Al, also stumble across Dr. Eva Rojas (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) whom Dirk saves from a sure death.  Eva has discovered an epidemic outbreak of a deadly disease that seems to come from the same country where Dirk intends to seek for the Texas.  Together Dirk, Al, and Eva begin to travel upstream of a river with his boss Admiral Jim Sandecker's (William H. Macy) speedboat to find the treasure and the disease.<br /><br />The quest for the gold treasure and the lethal illness is not without trouble, as they will meet people on both quests willing to stop them at all costs.  Luckily, Sahara employs the Navy Seal mystique to a level of super heroic quality, which will miraculously deliver the heroes to their destination.  This is done with a large amount of humor and action, as the film tries very hard to continue in the traditional approach of how many adventure movies attempt to balance comedy with suspense.  The film will turn into a roller coaster that swiftly moves from scene to scene, but does so without risk and suspense.  In addition, the director Breck Eisner moves too swiftly from scene to scene, and in some instances leaves the audience behind in the previous scene without a coherent and visual bridge into the following scene.It makes some scenes feel awkward, which resembles a first draft of a turn paper.  Thus, when Eisner walks out on the tightrope that he only keeps it a couple of feet of the ground he makes the fall funny.It makes some scenes feel awkward, which resembles a first draft of a turn paper.

B000069AT7|5.0|When it comes down to everyone's favorite film, there's always a feeling that you tend to look towards cinema classic; films that are so universally acclaimed it seems automatic someone would just inherently call it the best movie ever even if you've never seen it or it just makes other movies lesser in comparison. However, a film like E.T is one of those kind where I can honestly say it's one of my favorite films even if it doesn't have the cinematic contributions of Citizen Kane, the epic splendor of Lawrence of Arabia or the sheer excitement of Star Wars. Instead you get a very touching family film that will appeal to everyone, unless you're some jaded person.    Elliot (Henry Thomas) is a lonely kid with not a whole lot of friends, a split up family and is quite alienated. But near to his house, an alien being is left behind, stranding him on Earth. Elliot discovers him and with the help of Reeses' Pieces, adopts him into his family (sans mother's knowledge of course), names him \\"E.T\\" and has brother Michael and sister Gertie helping out. But there's others interested in E.T.'s presence on Earth and Elliot somehow has to get E.T back home even he wants him to stay.    Steven Spielberg has always been accused of putting sentimentality where it's not needed, as if he's too afraid the film will be too dark so he has to put something that ties everything up. E.T. though manages to be touching without schmaltzy or pandering. In fact, the film can even be heartwarming in several scenes. One of my favorites is after Gertie first sees E.T and runs away, with E.T, arms up in the air, going after her like a crazed movie monster. Sure it's silly but I got to admit, I chuckled. I always like how it was shot: mainly from a kid's point of view so, besides Elliot's mom, every adult's top half is never seen or their face is obscured. The film is almost like a modern fairy tale and so while we can forgive E.T.'s ability to contact his people with a Speak and Spell while NASA can't do it with a 50 foot dish, it's still for kids and you almost don't even notice it anyway.    Now I for one at least understand Spielberg's decision to do a bit of a redo of E.T's visuals, namely the character himself. Now he's more expressive and using more muscle features and movement but he looks, ironically, clunky. There's 2 noticeable problems right in the first scene alone: E.T hops rabbit-like instead of running in a straight line (a light on a track but still) which makes it almost more comical, then we have him running to a hill out of breath whereas in the original cut, he gazed solemnly and in one spot as his family takes off. Later on, his animation looks too noticeable against the more grainy/faded colors of the 1982 print, making him look more sharper than everything around him. But unlike long-time friend George Lucas who basically released the original Star Wars trilogy untouched because fans were mad the special editions were the only DVD version available, Spielberg at least knows some might prefer the old cut and some might want to watch the new one.    For those of you getting mad that Spielberg ruined E.T, keep in mind the original is still on this set and the Limited Edition 2 disc one so while some don't like the new changes, it's not like we can't have the old E.T. back and since it's such a great movie in its own right, that's a great thing to have.
B0001LJCPC|4.0|I think the soundtrack is a fresh sound to the same story. The First Soundtrack from Kill Bill Vol.1 fitted the story to give for flavor to this amazing film. In Kill Bill Vol.2 a song that is not on the credit listings is my focus. In the coffin scene The Bride recalls the pai mei punch technic. After gaining composer the brides focus on escape is met with a spanish trumphet slow at first and then met with a orchestra. I would love to Know the name of the composer and the title of the song. The Music serves as a motivator. Every time I hear this song I get Pumped and excited. If any one knows please comment. THANK YOU
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay has gotten better than ever with the release of their latest album \\"X & Y\\".  I was immediatly impressed when I heard \\"Speed of Sound\\", and could hardly wait for the album to come out.  I haven't been disappointed. The band has definitely gotten better; more guitar, improved vocal control for Martin, and incredible drumming!  The tracks are as follows:<br /><br /> Square One- very Coldplayish!  The percussion is awesome.<br /><br /> What If? This one is beautiful.  It begins simply and elevates to the end.  The vocals are incredible.<br /><br /> White Shadows- this one is kind of techno-like.  I really like the beat, and the strings in the beginning are reminescent of Clocks.<br /><br /> Fix You- an anthem.  A very moving song, lyrically as well as musically.<br /><br /> Talk has great guitar lines, and is very positive.<br /><br /> X & Y is haunting and mysterious.  Gorgeous.<br /><br /> The Speed of Sound is already a hit. If you haven't already heard it, it's surprising.  A good song.<br /><br /> A Message is mellower, but another great song.<br /><br /> Low is REALLY good.  It has an awesome bridge, and a very common rythym in Coldplay's music.<br /><br /> The Hardest part- one of my ABSOLUTE favorite songs.  It sounds like it should be in a movie; it's really happy and upbeat.<br /><br /> Swallowed in the Sea- another great song; sounds like much of their other music.<br /><br /> Twisted Logic is another haunting and mellow song.  I love the chords.<br /><br /> Buy it and you'll not be disappointed!<br /><br /> Fix You
B0001IN07Q|5.0|Mr. Michael Buble seems to have it all, from his boyish good looks to his superb voice and sense of humor. <br />While the style of this live-in-concert is a little chopped for my liking, overall it portrays him as a humble and healthy young man who loves what he does and makes no bones about it. <br />The personal glimpses into his life allow for us to see that he loves the genre he sings and feels a strong bond with those fans who support him.  <br />This is definately a dvd that you will replay over and over.

B00003CXCT|5.0|Although this is the \\"Special Edition\\", I can't help but love Star Wars. From the moment I saw those yellow words scroll to the top of the screen, I was hooked. I can only hope that Lucas will put out the originals as they were.  <br />My only complaint is that Hayden Christianson replaced Sebastian Shaw in the end sequence of Return of the Jedi. I could only accept it if they had replaced Alec Guinness with Ewan MacGregor. It just did not make any sense, plus Hayden looked akward and out of place.  <br />Other than this unnecessary change, I loved the set.
B0001XWV12|4.0|Hey y'all. I lived in Europe in the 80's and the vacations that I took to other locations in europe seemed a lot like this movie. I was in high school during that time and was completely concerned about drink, travel and sex. The best trip was to Lloret De Mar Spain for spring break. Yes, the things in this movie are certainly possible. This movie depicts the things on teenagers minds when they are free to do what they want. The different personalities of the four adventurers show what is important to them. If you review this movie and are critical that it holds no importance to the meaning of life, go take your Centrum Silver, drink some prune juice and go back to the activities room at the old folks home. Some people lose sight that movies like this are made for the fun and entertainment of it. Not to prove something profound. It's an awesome movie. Here in Iraq we use the \\"Escuze\\" line from the train trip to break the bordom. Enjoy it, it's great.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|This is one of the best sequels I have ever seen: not only does it avoid degenerating into a formula - with one of the principal characters killed off at the beginning - but it adds to the depth of all the players' characters. Bourne is still evolving in Damon's hands, becoming a new person from the confused automaton that he was in the first film, someone you can believe in and allow to enter your imagination. Of course, there are phenomenal action scenes, filmed in a you-are-there jerkiness, that reach new heights of realism in action film. (Interestingly, the director refused to use any computer animation, as he rightly knew the audience would recognise it as such.)<br /><br />But it is Damon who truly impresses: he adds creative twists to his characters like only a truly great actor can, carrying an entire environment with him you can identify with and believe, a genuine consciousness that the viewer can envision and empathise with. I would say he is this generation's Gene Hackman, a star who rises not on simple sex appeal but on outstanding acting talent. I would watch any film he is in.<br /><br />Warmly recommended. Let's hope they stop here, while the quality is maintained.
0140187650|5.0|This is a great book, filled with details and the following review is just a few thoughts jumping around the place to gain a general idea. I find Hannah Arendt a very credible author, a German, who attended Heidelburg University with a doctorate in philosophy and studied under Karl Jaspers and visiting professor at several prestigious universities in the United States. Her account takes in both her German experience, her stay at Jerusalem, attending the Eichmann trial, the reading of various court manuscripts of Eichmann and others. The book is rather detailed on the entire Jewish question of WWII, yet is not a book on the whole \\"Final Solution,\\" persay, but an account of the Eichmann trial. <br /> <br />While nonexhaustive, Arendt is penetrative, far more than these few paragraphs attempt to relate, and I highly recommend this book, Some of the ideas raised are the questions of ethnic restrictions, as even Israel and Judaism in endorsing marriage within the race and separation. There is the question of whether the trial should have been in Jerusalem or of an international court - inquiring as to crimes not only against the Jews but against humanity on a global scale. The charges of the defense aimed at Israel's competence in the trial location. Yet here we can see each European country holding trials in their own localities on Nazi war criminals, whereas Israel at that time did not have a nation when the Nuremburg and other trials took place. There are also the issues of the crimes themselves; personal responsibility, obedience to superiors, actions taken apart from superiors, the idea of the legality of the State (raison d'etat) overriding law in criminal actions to preserve itself verses the individual committing criminal actions. Yet here the State's action should be the exception to the rule, not the norm, for this was systematic genocide in a non-war capacity, actions taken apart from the reason of war and State preservation. <br /> <br />The fact that this man was not a monster, not a sadistic hate filled orgasmatic murderer but instead the epitome of a valueless or extreme relativistic void in existential space. Here was a logical man yes, but one who had morals? Eichmann was familiar, reading Theodore Herzel and so who was more fitted for the Nazi's to deal with the Jewish question? His morals conveniently fit the role he was actively pursuing. What was ultimately noted were his personal autonomous decisions apart from his superiors, particularly at the end of the war when Himmler ordered the cessation of the exterminations, attempting to put many of the prominent Jews up in Hotels in France to pacify the allies, thinking this could be his ticket to more lenient penalties, as though all would be forgiven as conscious guilt and crimes against humanity were not in his psyche, nor Eichmann's for that matter. Eichmann, claiming Himmler's orders against the Furers, continued the deportations/liquidations - genocidal actions. <br /> <br />There are the issues raised of the Jewish counsels selling out their own people and subsequent convictions, also the Germans separation of prominent Jews in the Jewish Ghetto, Theresienstadt, mostly for monetary purposes and trades, and the ironic half-Jews that Hitler himself left unmolested, and amazingly, one (some) of the mass murder responsible parties, as in Eichmann's superior, Heydrich, was also a half-Jew, which was kept in secrecy. And speaking of secrecy, Arendt writes of the Nazi \\"language rules\\", how terms like the \\"final solution,\\" \\"evacuation\\" and the likes, hid the realities of terms such as mass murder, torture and genocide. I can't help but be reminded of Orwell's \\"newspeak\\" language in \\"1984,\\" and the fact that language plays such a large part in all the distortions of the media that so influence society today. <br /> <br />Also informational, the communities/countries, such as the oppositions of Denmark and France. France became resistant when their own French Jews weredemanded from them, then the Germans had to back down, neither having the strength nor organization to fully implement their plans there. It's just a horror that all countries didn't fight for their Jewish residents and those made stateless by Germany.  There's much more to this book, the moral, social, political issues that question the validity of the case, how emotional detachment from the most horrendous crimes leave a cold objective reality where facts must be presented, and when they do, they almost always occur with paradox with shades of meanings that question others which are considered as valid.
0452282152|3.0|It's rare that the movie is just as good or better than the book.  I am particulary interested in true accounts such as this book. It has been fictionally embellished for entertainment purposes.  Yet its not over the top. <br />The narrative is very desriptive and honest without dragging out into unessary detail. <br />I felt like I was in 1600 Netherlands watching events unfold in my mind. She provides just enough insight to comprehend the moods and attitudes. <br />
B00005JNTX|4.0|It's really nice to see a movie produced in a new way. I'm so glad director Robert Rodriguez didn't put comic book frames in this.<br /><br /> (See, you can learn something from watching that awful \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" movie.)

B0000029DD|5.0|After listening to Jeff for 2 months I have decided that he is a great artist. <br />I first heard Buckley's voice when my sister brought a copy of Grace(Expanded Edition) to my house. <br />I wasn't impressed, <br />I just thought he was a semi-good musician. <br />But after listening to him for a few times I understood his music, <br />his art. <br />Jeff Buckley is our role model, <br />his music inspired me allot. <br />If I will ever be a musician my songs will always be inspired from him.
B0000028RR|5.0|Although I love them all, I chose to review this RATM record first because it had the biggest impact on me.  I had not heard anything like this before, and it floored me.  Let me tell ya, I don't like rap, or rapcore, or screaming or anything like that.  I LOVE this!  Agree or disagree with Zack's politics, he puts out there with great passion, attitude, and insight.  When I heard this, I was thrilled to hear rock be dangerous again.  I don't agree with everything he says, but I love to listen to him say/scream it.  They grab hold of you quickly here right out of the gate, and don't let go the whole way through.  What a ride!  If you are pissed off, get this record.  It'll hit the spot.  F*&K the system!

B00001OH7O|5.0|Without a doubt, THE album of music choice I would take with me on a deserted island. The only other I can think of would be The Cure's Disintegration. But this one doesn't make me want to stop blood flow.    It's an album of wonderful songs, separately and as one entity. Nothing gets me through the day quite like Hunky Dory. Red Bull aside.     But if we're picking favorites, I would take a bullet for \\"Quicksand\\".
B00000JY1X|5.0|First and foremost- this album offers over 50 beautifully constructed songs and I don't think there's any other record out there that offers this gargantuan amount of gems in a single package.<br /><br />That being said there's a few things you should consider if you are to invest in Stephin Merritt's masterwork:<br /><br />1-Don't be expecting much rock just because some file the Magnetic Fields under that genre, what we have here is purely indie pop.<br /><br />2-Most of the record is sung in Merritt's deep baritone croon (not too distant from Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon) so if you're not into that kind of singing it will be hard to get around the 42 songs in which he takes the vocal helm.<br /><br />3-The record consists mostly of highly romantic, often sad and usually literate love songs and while you're probably already expecting that (since you're reading this) not everybody is willing to sit through 3 hours of this sort of songs.<br /><br />4-The sound is very lo fi (it was recorded in a home studio) which means that while the song's information comes through very clearly you can't be expecting any kind of Todd Rundgren-harnessed production bombast. It is nonetheless a remarkably multi layered album.<br /><br />5-Despite its reputation of being of restricted appeal the truth is that at the heart of this record lie dozens of super catchy tunes and I would go so far as to say that there's something here for everyone since this is a very diverse set (pop, folk, electro, blues, country, soul...you name it and it's probably here) and one full of hidden rewards.<br /><br />A case could be made that all the music you need can be found here and this surely is an album that not only can be listened to months on end without tiring, it's also one of the defining records of the 90's, bornt of an unique inspiration and as that impossible to replicate.
B0002V7OI8|4.0|Art houses and college film courses sometimes use a theme along the lines of \\"Overlooked Films,\\" movies that were not warmly received by either the critics or the public but deserve a better fate. This movie epitomizes that class.  <br /> <br />Often after a movie like this one has screened, the decent common folk exiting the theater will think they've just seen a pretty good yarn. But the \\"intelligentsia\\" -- like amazon's lead reviewer above -- will hate it. True, this film is pure Hollywood, but in the best sense: a taut and economical script, stock characters we can't help but come to care about, and a carefully contrived ending that packs an emotional wallop. The \\"cultural elite\\" and 2nd-year grad students can go watch \\"Persona,\\" myself, I'll curl up with a large popcorn and coke and allow myself to just enjoy the show! <br /> <br />This was Dreamworks first release, and Spielberg's populist fingerprints are all over this. It was also Mimi Leder's first theatrical direction, and it benefits from her TV commercial training, bringning a disciplined, unpretentious eye. The acting is uniformly solid, Morgan Freeman is splendid as the President who must preside over the Apocalypse. <br /> <br />If there is a weakness in Deep Impact, it's Tea Leoni in the lead role, who seems a bit detached (dare I say, \\"stoned\\"?), although she does manage to help drive the plot along. Veterans such as Robt Duvall, Max Schell, and Lynn Redgrave earn their salaries. <br /> <br />The film ultimately succeeds because in the end it manages to lift the human pathos of a worldwide disaster above the \\"wow\\" special effects, a difficult assignment. They may be hokey to the intelligentsia, but the timeless qualities of heroism, devotion to family, and self sacrifice for the good of others are the stuff that make for moving drama; there is actually something to be learned from this movie. As Freeman says in his last speech in front of a half-destroyed US Capitol Building, \\"Cities fall, but we can rebuild them. And heroes die, but they are remembered...\\"
B0001Z36PK|5.0|I'm just held by amazement that whatever Neil Hannon sets out something to do, he does it very well.  He has never really failed even in a single occasion--even on the atmospheric Brit-rock of \\"Regeneration\\", which is also a wonderful album--and now he returns to the old form (as the others had said) with his latest opus, \\"Absent Friends\\". <br /> <br />Each of The Divine Comedy albums is touting the same basic influences (Scott Walker et al), but otherwise carrying a different style, tone, theme, and feel, and \\"Absent Friends\\" is no exception.  On this album, musically it presents another totally different motif:  American Western, which Neil and co. surprisingly pull off so well--conpiscuously heard on the opening title track, \\"Come Home Billy Bird\\", and \\"Our Mutual Friend\\", which boasts a full, vibrant stringwork, and the Midwestern-ish perspective of \\"Freedom Road\\", where Neil talks about life in the cross-country, with the familiar pick-up trucks and stuff. I can even hear a lot of banjoes on \\"My Imaginary Friend\\" and the charming closer \\"Charmed Life\\",--you think that they might sound out of place with the characteristic TDC style, but no... it sounds otherwise fantastic!  Sometimes you can't mistake the downbeat \\"Regeneration\\" strains still lingering on such tracks as the heart-rending \\"Leaving Today\\" and the eerie \\"The Wreck Of The Beautiful\\", which pretty feels like a suicide note or something to that effect--but fascinating nevertheless (just don't play that in the dark--it creeps me out!). <br /> <br />Of course, what has largely inspired \\"Absent Friends\\" is Neil's family life.  The lyrical cad of old has grown up and is now a dad, but his knack for writing witty lyrics hasn't tarnished a bit--in fact its ambers are still burning, so to speak.  That's the usual problem of other musicians who have left their supposedly 'exciting' lives and enter marriage and parenthood, and their so-called creative matter has just begun to go downward from that moment on.But not so here.  Whether Neil talks about the peculiarities of childhood (\\"My Imaginary Friend\\"), the ambiguities of adolescence (\\"The Happy Goth\\", with lyrics like \\"And her face is whiter than the snows of Hoth/She wears Dr. Martens and a heavy cross/ But on the inside she's a happy goth\\"), and moments of parenthood (\\"The Happy Goth\\" again, the catchy pop song of \\"Come Home Billy Bird\\", and the heart-tugging \\"Charmed Life\\"), he tackles them all successfully without sounding corny or small.  I also like \\"Sticks and Stones\\" boasting lyrics like \\"You and I go together/ Like the molar and the drill/ Flesh is weak but darling we know/ That the ego's weaker still\\" (ooohhh!) and \\"Our Mutual Friend\\", a tale of betrayal which always makes me think it's a cross between \\"Something For The Weekend\\" and \\"The Frog Princess\\". Great stuff.  <br /> <br />Overall, a brilliant, poignant, wonderful album which has lost none of the old Divine Comedy charm... simply, another masterpiece from Neil!  And I'm still held by amazement...
0679731725|5.0|A short monologue (about 250 pages) dictated by Stevens, the Butler of Darlington Hall in the 1950s who, on the recommendation of his new American employer, takes a trip out to the English countryside.<br /><br />Of course, priding himself on his professionalism, he uses the trip for work purposes in the hope of recruiting a former worker back to Darlington Hall after he had convinced himself that, from her letter, she wanted to return.<br /><br />So off he goes and all the while he recalls the major events of Darlington Hall during the 1930s as his employer, Lord Darlington, dabbles in politics and demonstrates Nazi sympathies - a man more influenced by others than someone to aspire to. All the while, of course, Stevens is the consummate professional and his attitude to his master is one of love and respect, a man whom he would obey without question.<br /><br />The prose is sweet. Stevens' voice is smooth, well constructed, and so utterly natural, and his musings over trying to come to terms with the world via such minor quibbles as perfecting the art of bantering demonstrate a wonderful character. Polite the whole way through his language only falters when it almost seems his emotions are about to better him and tears are ready to gush.<br /><br />Written in the late 1980s this Booker Prize winner from Ishiguro is an interesting look at professionalism and I think, at least to me, it demonstrates how we need to find a balance between achieving our goals and being true to ourselves.
B00005N9CV|5.0|The album \\"The Look of Love\\" is the pinnicle of Jazz achievement. If you love Jazz, you can't go wrong by purchasing this Jazz CD album. Diana combines her warm charm with her talent to make this great masterpiece.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Of all the new bands plundering post punk and new wave to exhaustion Franz Ferdinand are definitely at the forefront of the movement and that's probably because they refine their influences and don't simply mimic their forerunners (like The Bravery do with Duran Duran for example).<br /><br />Still the three albums that in my opinion have had the most influence in their sound are the Gang of Four's \\"Entertainment\\" (the groove and the occasional shards of spiky guitars), the Teardrop Explodes' \\"Kilimanjaro\\" (the wilful lunacy and the organic incorporation of new wave stylings) and especially Orange Juice's \\"You Can't hide your love forever\\" (the literate artsiness and the ability to turn into pop everything they touch).<br /><br />They seem to take something from every post punk band and brew their own sound out of it, creating in the process songs to match those of their idols, here residing cuts as stellar as \\"Darts of Pleasure\\"(with its out of control german sung coda), \\"Come on Home\\"(augmented by some vintage keyboards) or the intense powerhouse that's \\"Jacqueline.<br /><br />They've succeeded basically because they're better than any of their peers and also as a result of a dud free debut album that boasts eleven very coherent songs, among them being several flat out stunners destined to be hits.
B0009IW88A|4.0|This soundtrack is both exciting and relaxing to listen to.  Whenever I go to the movies there's two things that I'm looking for in flim:  A good storyline and the type of musical store that encompasses the film.  The musical score fits the film very well and the film's composers Hans Zimmer and James Newton add an interesting and dramatic blend of sound effects and orchestra music throughout the entire film and soundtrack.  The songs have both a haunting and mystical rhythmn that fits perfectly with the persona of Batman who has become a timeless legend in the hearts of young and old alike.  If you like the previous soundtracks of the Batman genre you'll definitely love this CD. It's well worth the time to listen to it and it also helps to relax and clear your mind.
0440237688|5.0|I read this book about 3 years ago in one afternoon just because it was on my mom's bookshelf.  It was so thought provoking that I still think about it today.  It's a very quick way to have a new outlook on society and life.  I highly reccommend it.

0060977493|5.0|This is one of the most beautifully written novels in English in recent memory. Despite its flaws, the most notable of which is the author's sometime lack of restraint on her writing, this is a transcendent piece of work, lushly imagined and written. This novel is a sweeping saga that creates a world in itself. The style is stunningly self-assured for a first time novelist and it has the tempo of someone who has set out to write \\"the mother of all novels\\" and almost succeeded.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was an amazing show that wasn't given a chance by Fox when it was originally broadcast (episodes were shown out of order!). If you haven't seen the show you should pick it up, it well worth the price! It's a smart show, with sharp characters, great sci-fi effects, and amazing and fun dialogue. You won't regret picking up this show. <br /> <br />wlg
B000AYEL1A|5.0|Ok...I'm a sap for a love story.  I saw this in the theaters 5X  (on TV several more) and bought the original LP then everything I could find on it music-wise.  Needless to say, I LOVED IT! <br /> <br />Now that I have a DVD player, I want the DVD...and will probably wear it out.  No, I don't particularly care for Kris K's singing (love his song writing), but he's not a bad (SEXY) actor.  I was at the age, movie-wise, that I saw him as drop dead gorgeous!  I had occasion to work FARM AID with him years later and found out he's a nice man, too. <br /> <br />Barbra is...well what can I say?  She was superb!  \\"Evergreen\\" is a classic.  I loved the other songs, as well, but this was my favorite with \\"Lost Inside of You\\" being my second favorite. Her acting was great and I thought they made a great movie couple. <br /> <br />OK... so I'm an incurable romantic, but I'm jumping at the chance to get this on DVD. If you love a love story, you'll love this!
0385513755|5.0|This book is awesome, don't buy the regular novel, it would just be a waste knowing that THIS edition is out there for a little bit more, and it's a great bargain price, because at Barnes&Noble (where I was able to view it before buying it on Amazon for a lot less), it cost $35 (plus tax), and for just a simple $23 from Amazon, it's sooo worth it! The pictures in the book are beautiful digitally reprinted, and are the exactual paintings and drawings that they describe, along with the places and people that they are talking about ... in short, this book really enhances the novel, it makes you think that it's a NON-fiction as oppose to a work of fiction!<br /><br />It is hardcover with a jacket sleeve as a cover (in case you don't know what jacket sleeve covers are - those are books where the cover has nothing printed on it themselves and are completely blank, but comes with a printed cover that have flaps that fold into the insides of the book, like a bookcover). It is threaded binding, and the pages are glossy, high quality paper.
B0000009SY|5.0|Joe's Garage (the song) is outstanding.  Listen to the closing chorus on 'Packard Goose'.  'Dong Work For Yuda' is brilliant, and  you can literally feel Joe's anguish on Watermelon In East Hay.  There's silly stuff here, but there are also moments of musical  genius, harmonies and guitar work that make your hair stand on end.  But don't let your mother catch you listening to it.  Zappa pulls no punches.  It's obscene, funny, gross, sad, startling, and crude.  But it has licks of some of the best music ever recorded.
B0000029GA|5.0|First I wanna start by addressing the people who gave this album below 4 stars. U people have got to be kidding me. I read a review on this site and that person gave the album below 4 stars because of the beats. It was 1994 for god's sake. This album is nothing short of 5 stars period. To be only 20 years old and flow like that is just off the chain. No wonder he's still in the game and currently holding NYC down. For those of u reading this review, if u are a hip-hop fan and don't own a copy of illmatic shame on u. U should definitly be on ur way to the record store to get one off top and dats 4 real!
B0009HLDFU|5.0|Man why don't you guys just go buy a cd player? <br />who cares if its copy protected? do you enjoy ripping bands off? <br />pay the money for this awesome 2cd set and enjoy.
0790729725|3.0|The movie itself deserves a 5 star rating, but I gave it only 3 stars for the DVD edition. If you really want to enjoy the movie, then buy the 2-disc special edition, it's only like $5 more anyway, and you get the whole movie on just one disc, this single disc edition I don't like because you have to flip the disc over a little past halfway through the movie... and who the hell wants to watch a movie where they have to get up to turn the disc over??? I mean, isn't that why people upgraded from VHS and cassette tapes to DVDs and CDs!?
B000002UR7|4.0|This was Radiohead's debut album from 1993 on Capitol.  It includes the biggest hit and most known song of their career, \\"Creep\\".  This album is bashed by some Radiohead fans for not being complex or interesting enough, but I don't see why it is so badly criticized.  You is a very good song that sounds a little like their newer stuff, Creep has guitar spazams before the chorus and self-loathing lyrics.  How Do You and Stop Whispering are just poppy grungy rock songs that aren't bad.  Thinking About You is a pretty little acoustic ballad, and Anyone Can Play Guitar is a good song.  Same with Ripcord and Vegetable.  Prove Yourself has a simple and catchy chorus and a neat guitar solo.  I Can't is pretty cool, and Lurgee is probably the best song here, which hints of what's to come in their career.  Blow Out is interesting, it starts out soft and ends up with a huge blast of guitars all the way to the end.  Then there's the edited version of Creep at the end. <br /> <br />I would recommend this being your starting place for Radiohead if the only song you know is Creep.  I also recommend it to fans of '90 pop culture history and grunge rock.
0375713751|3.0|I kind of liked this book. I didn't love it - but liked it enough to consider reading another book by this author. I do not have children, but I thought the way she was 'short' with her husband and children was totally believable. I could sooo believe how it was that easy to be absorbed by your mental 'to-do' list - even if less than half of those things you never get around to doing. It took me quite a while to get to the point where I actually WANTED to read on (I am an obsessive reader and would read ANYTHING rather than say.....watch TV - not always a good thing). I especially appreciated the whole Jack storyline....actually, I really appreciated the reality of it, even if it wasn't my favorite read.......it makes sense to me.  <br />I would absolutely read another of her books.
B00079018K|4.0|First of all, let me talk about the music itself before disucssing the copyright issue and how to fix it. Kasabian's debut album is incredible. It sucks you in with \\"Club Foot.\\" Throughout the album you'll hear \\"ooooo's\\" and \\"ahhhh's\\" that kind of remind me of Coldplay. I love just about every song in it. I would recommend getting this album, even with the hassle of copyright protection.  The last two songs in the album seem to be the worse, and didn't go well with it.     Here is where the problem is. The copyright protection is a joke. When I put it in my computer it rebooted it. It wouldn't let me play it at all. With a little research I found out how to solve it.     1. Hold shift down while inserting the disk. This will disable autorun and stop it from rebooting your computer.    2. Press start, control panel, system, hardware tab, and press device manager.     3. Enable device view connection and show hidden devices in the \\"View\\" tab. You should see a driver named SbcpHid. Right click it and press properties.    4. Go to the Driver tab and press stop button. Then select \\"Disabled\\" as your start up type.    5. Right click the cd drive the album is in and press Open With...    6. Open it with whatever program you want to use to listen to it or rip it.     I hope this have helped, as this took about 2 hours to solve. I was very frustrated.
0451529308|3.0|Little Women (the book) is a great novel, and deserves 5 stars, it's wholesome and innocent, and it's a genuine classic ... but if you want the best edition of the novel, I suggest the Barnes&Noble print of it, and that's why I gave this review only 3 stars. The Barnes&Noble edition at their store is only about $10 and it's hardcover, you get the exact same words, PLUS ~ introduction, time-line, short bio of author, end-notes, and even questions and comments at the end about the novel... although I really love this painting on the Signet Classic paperback edition, the painting on this one is \\"Home Sweet Home\\".
B00004VVNB|4.0|I remember this movie when it first came out in 1976 and it was as memorable now as it was then.  Yes Star Wars came out at about the same time, but Star Wars for the most part was set in outer space.  This was set down here on merry old earth.  Star Wars also had a budget many times larger than Logans Run.  By todays standards the special effects seem almost campy but in 1976 they where cutting edge.  If you get the chance read the book which is even better. About the only thing I could fault it for was the lack of background regarding all that's happened and is happening.
1878424114|5.0|I had a few hours to while away yesterday. So dropped in to the local borders(I hope amazon won't mind!) to see what they had. Came across this book and started reading it. After reading it I couldn't put it down. So bought it, stayed in their cafeteria and continued reading it. Took me about 2 hours. Those two hours changed the rest of my day. <br />I stopped judging my wife's actions. Instead I took her a nice candy bar after work. She was delighted. We had a great conversation because instead of judging her, I actually listened to her and just had a great time with her. <br />I tried to just live in the present and concentrate on what i was doing rather than thinking of what i did in the past or what i was going to do in the future. I found that I was more aware and attentive to what was happenning around me. My brain was working faster and I felt more intelligent and confident. <br />The way I look at it is that we need to be programmed for success. Some people are fortunate in that when they were growing up their parents and people surrounding them gave them sound advice and they got programmed right. <br />For those of us who were not that lucky, we need to program ourselves. Read this book. Contemplate. Practice it. Program yourself. Practice it again and again. You will become a really beautiful person!
B000063UR1|1.0|Because Doug Trumbull -- a pioneering special-effects technoweenie -- was the guy who initiated \\"Silent Running\\" (to use some of the special effects techniques he developed for \\"2001,\\" he said), I have sometimes toyed with the idea that the whole thing was an elephantine _parody_ of '70s environmentalism.<br /><br />The presence of Bochco and Cimino as writers has made me -- reluctantly -- discard this delicious notion, though.<br /><br />Cimino, so far as I can tell (read Steven Bach's \\"The Final Cut,\\" about Cimino and the \\"Heaven's Gate\\" fiasco that was the final straw for United Artists) _has_ no sense of humor.<br /><br />And Bochco was the writer for a \\"New Twilight Zone\\" episode that was, if anything, even more redolent of New Age moonbattery than was \\"Silent Running.\\"
6302636779|3.0|A well done  movie with Audrey Hepburn. The movie is better than you might think.
0596007124|5.0|This book is very different then anything that I read. When I was reading I was adicted to read more. I just couldn't stop reading. <br /> <br />Everything is excelent: examples, expenations, etc. It is easy reading and I plan to buy more books from this series. <br /> <br />I recomend this book to anyone that is learning design patterns.
B000002J09|5.0|Though all of their albums (at least the ones from 1969 up to 1975) all worth owning, if I could only own one Led Zeppelin, it would have to be \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\". This is the band's best album.<br /><br />When this album was released in 1971, it had no title on it, and I don't believe the band even printed their names on the cover, leaving the listenrs to find out just who these daring nameless musicians were. Well, it was of course Zeppelin. The eight songs encapsulated on this album are probably their best recordings. Like I did in my review for \\"Houses Of The Holy\\", here is a summary of each song.<br /><br />\\"Black Dog\\" - a Zeppelin classic. Everyone knows the immortal opening lines. 10/10<br /><br />\\"Rock And Roll\\" - another classic. The riff is classic. Bonham and Page are at their best on this one. And Plant wails like a madman. 10/10<br /><br />\\"Battle Of Evermore\\" - one of the most underrated tunes in the band's catalogue. Page's acotusic playing on the song is amazing. 10/10<br /><br />\\"Stairway To Heaven\\" - just three words. Greatest song ever. 10/10<br /><br />\\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" - another criminally underrated Zeppelin gem. 10/10<br /><br />\\"Four Sticks\\" - I don't really remember this one (I havent's heard the album in a while, to be honest), but I'll give it a 10/10 anyway.<br /><br />\\"Going To California\\" - yet another underrated masterpiece. 10/10<br /><br />\\"When The Levee Breaks\\" - as one reviewer, said this is one of the darkest songs Led Zeppelin ever recorded. This is blues that Zeppelin and only Zeppelin can do. The harmonica on this song is fantastic. A great way to close the album. 10/10<br /><br />Overall, this album is Led Zeppelin's masterpiece. This is one cd that belongs in anybody's record collection.
0880794968|5.0|I've been reading Tarot for about six years now, beginning with the lovely Connolly deck; I loved the stained-glass quality, but didn't feel I was getting quite enough of the fundamental symbolism. I decided to choose a deck with the original Rider-Waite imagery, and was greeted with a wide variety of options; the Universal Waite was the one that jumped out at me, appealing to my love of timeless artistry and clear but subtle color. <br /> <br />Shortly after I began reading, I fell in love with Tarot all around and began collecting decks - Mythic, Arthurian, Goddess, and at least a dozen more - but the Universal Waite deck is my standby and never lets me down. Practical as well as beautiful, it has helped me to learn the intricacy of Tarot's symbols, and I've always found that it works well with any reference book that uses the Rider-Waite deck as its source. Perfect for beginners or masters and everyone in between - right down to the backs, a striking black studded with artistic golden stars...a perfect symbol for Tarot's ability to help us find our own light in the darkness.
B00005JNSK|2.0|Maybe if I didn't read the book and watched the original movie I would have given it 2 stars, but I did too much. It was different then both of them. Both of them were better. <br />         <br />The oompa loompas (I hope I spelled it right.) are not like the original ones. There songs are good, but I absolutely love the one in the original movie. I think they had the hardest part in the movie which is pretty sad to me seeing as Johnny Depp or whoever plays Charlie should.  <br /> <br />The part about Willy's childhood was sad but made no sense. How do you love teeth better than your own child? Did the dad only search for him when he made candy? Why could Willy just let them live in the factory in the first place? His family is not all that bad. Just because he didn't get enough love that doesn't mean he can't either. <br /> <br />I liked how they showed the outcome of the other Golden Ticket winners. <br />
B0006L0LOS|3.0|Our society is filled with sheep and many of them would like you to believe how baaaad this movie is.  Well, they're wrong.  IMHO, \\"Wild Wild West\\" with Will Smith is the worst movie of all time with the recent remake of \\"Ladykillers\\" with Tom Hanks following a close second.  Catwoman is not even close to being in their league.  As a matter of fact I find it to be on par with \\"The Fast and the Furious\\", \\"The Transporter\\", and the X-men movies.  With the exception of the first two, the Batman series SUCKED and did not get nearly the trashing that this movie unfairly received.  I don't include the superior \\"Batman Begins\\" movie with the others. <br /> <br />Halle Berry's acting is pretty good and she looked amazing!  I felt the duality she was trying to bring to the role when her character began to change.  Her chemistry with Benjamin Bratt was very hot and they made a very good couple.  Sharon Stone was beautiful in this movie and held her own as the bad guy.  Her character was not contrived in the least, none of the characters were. <br /> <br />All and all, I think this movie was entertaining, had a good amount of action, and had a good plot.  I think the female characters were strong and three-dimensional.  Alex Borenstein is great as Halle's friend and adds that bit of comic relief that was just perfect.  Yes, the single women obsess over getting dates - BFD - that's what single women do!  It doesn't mean they are idiots or weak because they want to find a companion. <br /> <br />So give this movie a try and watch it with an open mind.  If you go looking for a turkey, you will find one.  I prefer to be optimistic and make up my own mind.  I'm glad I watched this movie!
0679720200|2.0|Being allergic to books that are considered classics, I did not see what all the fuss surrounding the book was about. I just thought, huh? That really was the first thing that wandered through my confused brain after finishing this book.  <br /> <br />Who is this guy, marseult, anyways? At first appearance, he seems like a robot. then I think, maybe he has mental issues. maybe he had a traumatic childhood. His mom dies, and he doesn't care. his girlfriend has to actually ask him to marry her instead of the other way around. she asks, \\"do you love me?\\" and he replies, \\"maybe, i don't know\\" And then he shoots someone for basically no reason at all and feels no remorse for it. That didn't sound like a person to me. I mean, we all have our moments of weird random emotions (remember the time you couldn't stop yourself from smiling when you were in the principal's office and in deep trouble?) but this was just over the top. The back of the book says that it's about a man \\"caught in the situation of the absurd\\", but any normal man would have avoided the whole situation right off the bat. I say its a absurd person caught in a quicksand situation of his own doing.  <br /> <br />Many people have said that this Marseult was an existentialist, but I say that's no excuse. I consider myself to be an absurdist with a touch of existentialism, but that's no reason for me to not feel. In fact, I don't consider him to be a existentialist at all, because that's not the reason he doesn't have emotions. I seriously think he has mental problems, not just a different view in life. <br /> <br />However, considering the fact that since so many people have written glowing reviews that must be some deeper meaning here that my befuddled mind could not grasp, I feel that the reason for the \\"huh?\\" is me, not the book.  <br /> <br />But, just to stand out, agonize everyone, and generally make a nuisance out of myself, I have decided to give this book two stars. Yes, there is the thing about standing up for your views, but I consider that a side dish that distracts from my main goals :  to stand for all the people out there who don't understand Literature with a capital L, who sit in silence and scratch their head until one thought enters their mind: huh? <br /> <br />
B0006L16N8|2.0|Here it is!  The album that Coldplay try to become U2, and Chris Martin bemoans a bunch of troubles he's not actually having.  Rule #1 - you don't make lovesick music when you're married to a wealthy Hollywood actress.  Rule #2 - U2 is the most bloated band of the last 20 years, and you should not model your band after THAT.  Seriously, this is the most over-hyped, overrated, boring music to be released with such anticipation.  Guitar riffs are repeated over and over again, and the band apparently tried to recreate \\"Clocks\\" 12 different ways for this album.  Their first two albums were a great alternative to the genre, but this is just a shame.  By the time I make it to \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\" I just feel like yelling \\"shuuuut up\\" and smashing this disc into a fine dust.  Kiss your precious Coldplay good-bye... they have become Matchbox 20 (**shiver**).
006092988X|4.0|This book was really moving for me. I read it in 8th grade and still remember it. I especially loved the symbolism of the tree, that was very moving. The characters are very memorable and the language very easy to understand. Some parts get a little tedious but still a great read!

B0007Y4TVU|3.0|System of a Down is no doubt one of the most original bands out there.  Due to Serj Tankian's original vocals and purely insane writing style, System of a Down has risen to be known as the \\"Breath of fresh air\\" of our generation.  Their debut album (Self-Titled) was a masterpiece.  Mixing deranged vocals with utter rediculously catchy lyrics thrashed towards the government, System of a Down emerged and became their own genre.  In 2001, System of a Down released Toxicity.  This is when System of a Down truly became popular.  This is also when Serj Tankian showed off that he could sing, and proved to people that he wasn't all about screaming crude sounding vocals.  Steal This Album! was later released and was a compilation of all of the unreleased work of System of a Down.  As previously stated, System of a Down is original for one thing...Serj Tankian...What happens when you take air-time away from Serj?  Well, you get a mediocre singer by the name of Daron Malakian (although an excellent guitarist and song writer).  Mezmerize is born.    Mezmerize takes away what made the previous albums so catchy.  Serj Tankian.  His original vocal style and songwriting was certainly fresh.  Instead of that, we get the completely average works of Daron Malakian (who wrote most of the music and lyrics).  Malakian's voice sounds like he came fresh out of one of those washed up boy bands, and it does not fit the band at all.    Mezmerize opens up with the intro \\"Soldier Side.\\"  A boring and useless track that just takes up time, and just adds more air-time to Malakian's already tiring voice.  But then the real fun begins, and this is where the album starts to show some light.  B.Y.O.B. (Bring Your Own Bombs) is a straight up gnarly attack towards our lying and cheating government.  It is rambled with lunatic lyrics and mind-numbingly catchy music.  \\"Why do they always send the poor?\\" screeches Malakian as the government is shot down by System of a Down in pure flaming glory.  After B.Y.O.B., you kinda wish the rest of the album was like that, right?  Well, unfortunately it isn't.  Revenga follows B.Y.O.B. and is a clutter of rumpled lyrics and vocals.  \\"Bleeding in a sink\\" and \\"My Sweet Clementine\\" do not connect well at all through this track.  Fortunately, there is Cigaro.  Ah, good old System of a Down.  Insane, foul mouthed, and not afraid to say anything.  Cigaro is fun...real fun.  Despite its' repetitiveness, you cannot help but be embroiled with its' catchy tune.      \\"Hey man, look at me rockin' out, I'm on the radio!\\"  To much dismay, Radio/Video is a crack at people on the radio and is a squalid song and is very repetitive.  Not once does the song provide any entertainment, thrills, chills, or even a moment of enjoyment.  Next up, is \\"This Cocaine Makes me Feel like I'm on This Song\\", which has the best title on the track.  Unfortunately, each lyric is pretty random, and does not work.  Luckily, Serj's vocals save the day and shows that he \\"is\\" the voice of System of a Down, and not Malakian.  Violent Pornography is a smash at the porn industry.  Hearing the first lines of the song, and hearing Serj rock out after \\"Everybody, everybody, everybody livin' now.  Everybody, everybody, everybody dies\\" is a charm.  However, as soon as \\"It's a violent pornography!\\" kicks in, the entire song is ruined, with bad vocals, and bad timing.  It does not match up with the rest of the song well.    Question!  The only song on the album that Serj helped write the music for.  It is also one of the few songs that work.  The lyrics are cliched, but the vocals and guitar and drum work well make up for that in this nice pleaser.  Sad Statue works well, not because of its' vocals or lyrics, but because of the guitar work by Malakian.  It is a pleasure listening to him jam on that guitar in the exciting opening intro.  Old School Hollywood is the real odd one of the bunch.  It has a sorta techno beat to it, and oddly goes along well with \\"Tony Danza cuts inline.\\"  Lost in Hollywood finishes the album off nicely.  It is a nice little requiem of those who didn't make it in Hollywood.  The vocals by Malakian are awful, but what makes it so good is the background vocals of Tankian, which, if listened to carefully, can induce some serious teared up eyes.      All in all, Mezmerize is average.  Is it bad?  Certainly not.  Is it good?  No, not really.  It is missing one key factor that made System of a Down great.  The writing of Tankian.  Teamwork and chemistry between the band has always been one of their strong points, but that didn't work here, because Malakian took over the album and made it cookie cutter average.  Some songs such as B.Y.O.B. are great, but most are bad and not worthy of being blasted out on the stereo.  Die-Hard fans won't like it, but new fans will love it.  Maybe when Malakian sang \\"Welcome, to the Soldier Side.  Where there's no one here but me.\\", he was talking about the album itself.
B0000CAXID|3.0|While I can appreciate the raw sound and energy with Dave's first release, this definitely has the feel of a demo (which it more or less was supposed to be from what I understand). The sound quality is so-so and some songs are throw aways. <br /> <br />That said, a true Foo fan should have this album.  It provides an interesting glimpse into the start of Dave's/Foo Fighters' progression as a band.  From this point you can see the band's songs and sound grow and improve over subsequent albums.  Give it a listen, but I would not recommend it over any of the other Foo Fighters albums.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|This movie is very overrated. There are a few funny parts but not much. You have to sit through 15 minutes of nothing to get to a funny part.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|although they are political motivated and have several strange songs system of a down is the best rock band of this generation of rock bands. bands like korn and tool eventually stop making albums, this band just keeps coming back harder and better than before. each one of their albums makes a statement but this one will always rock. <br /> <br />from \\"soldier side into\\" to \\"lost in hollywood\\" this album rocks. from songs about revenge, war, hollywood, tv, and even cocks, this  band just kicks ass. with kickass vocals, guitar riffs, and creative lyrics makes this album the best album of 2005. so if you want to buy this album and if you do you won't regret it. <br /> <br />and don't miss the second part of this doulbe album (mezmerize/hynotize) \\"hypnotize\\" coming in some time in november.
6305090564|4.0|This movie proves that there is a region between big budget science fiction thrillers like \\"Starship Troopers\\" and \\"Independence Day\\" and low budget stuff that is barely tolerable (or intolerable in many cases) such as \\"Blood Surf.\\"  We once called these movies B-science fiction movies, though that terminology is somewhat out of style.  Regardless, this movie is an excellent B-movie that is a lot of fun to watch.<br /><br />This movie does not take the easy way out by having a nice simple plot.  The plot starts simple enough, but then gets very complicated.  Fortunately, the giant carnivorous priapulid worms that the actors encounter manage to solve much of the complexity.<br /><br />The movie begins with a nice simple attack on a cruise ship.  The ship's owner is having a little money problems and decides the easy way out is to have the ship sunk, which then allows him to get the insurance money.  However, when the hired mercenaries board the ship they are unable to find anyone, and they keep hearing strange noises.  Then mercenaries start disappearing into the water pouring into the ship's bowels.<br /><br />Interlude time:  While we are waiting to get a clear view of whatever is running around making people disappear we meet a burglar, Trillian St. James (Famke Janssen) and we learn more about the captain of the ship carrying the mercenaries, John Finnegan (who was clueless about why he was hired), well played by Treat Williams.  We also meet a number of mercenaries, albeit briefly in many cases, and finally encounter the captain of the cruise ship and the owner.  Of course, they are all blathering about something wandering about the ship and eating people, but we know better.  Right?<br /><br />Okay, after finding that there are people on the ship after all, just not as many as the mercenaries initially thought, they finally meet their first priapulid worm.  Of course, the meeting does not go well for the worm (the mercenaries are well armed) or the mercenaries (the worms are well-teethed), and things begin to spiral out of control from there.  Everyone finally gets the bright idea that they should forget about stealing and robbing and sinking the ship and just getting off the ship and away from the ship.  Unfortunately for the people on the ship, the worms have other ideas that involve pulling people into their gut and digesting them alive.<br /><br />The remainder of the movie is a cat and mouse, or worm and man, game.  You must not think that these worms are your typical earth-type worms.  These worms move like extremely fast, flexible and slimy snakes.  These worms have nasty mouths and can suck you into their gut quicker than you can say \\"Look out!\\" or \\"AAHHH!\\"  The worm then slowly digests the victim.  In once scene the mercenaries and sundry others manage to remove a victim from a worm.  It turns out that was not such a good idea (I will not attempt to describe that particular scene).<br /><br />I was afraid that this movie was going to turn into a cheese fest.  However, it turned out to be surprisingly good.  The worms were clearly CGI, but they still looked very good.  There are scenes where the worms interact with their surroundings, and those scenes are uniformly excellent.  The scenes may not be believable, but they are well done.  The mercenaries and the worms are well-matched, and I thought there was never a certainty in the outcome.<br /><br />If you can believe that worms that are usually no more than six inches or so in length can somehow be many feet long, and can move about as fast as a running man, and if you like Treat Williams or Famke Janssen, this movie is a popcorn munching treat.  However, you may want to put away the popcorn when that guy pops out of the worm; that scene is really gross.enaries (the worms are well-teethed), and things begin to spiral out of control from there.

B000AYEL1A|5.0|I've been patiently waiting for this to come out on DVD and was so excited when I saw that it finally was coming.  I love Barbra and have been a fan for many years. I have seen this movie probably about 10 times and have the album and CD.  I'm sure I'll wear the DVD out. Not wild about Kris' music, but the rest of the music is excellent.
B000002JKA|4.0|I generally consider Dream Theater to be a progressive rock group.  However, much of this music lies more squarely in the realm of metal or hard rock with progressive elements rather than being as solidly progressive as Dream Theater has been.  Because I started listening to Dream Theater with the fanciful \\"Images and Words\\" and the intellectual \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\" it took me a while to get into this album, which is stylistically quite different from those two albums.<br /><br />I think of the opening number as being a commentary on being in the rat race.  \\"6:00\\" asks how we can face each day, in the same old way, giving up other things that we think are important.  Given that a rock group is singing this the context is in appropriate musical terms (\\"Melody walks through the door\\").  The intent of this fast-paced song seems to be that we often give up our dreams for a mundane 9 to 5 job.  Perhaps it is not too late to break out, because we have thought about doing so often enough, when the music takes us away.<br /><br />The following song keeps the same theme as the first song.  \\"Caught in a Web\\" looks at being in a rut from another viewpoint.  The guitars crunch and wail on this song that has moments of interest, but is one of the less inspired songs on this CD.<br /><br />The next three tracks combine to make up the nearly twenty and a half minute long \\"A Mind Beside Itself.\\"  The first track is an instrumental that foreshadows some of the work in \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.\\"  The second and third tracks are songs: \\"Voices\\" and \\"The Silent Man.\\"  As the title of the trilogy suggests, these songs are about various aspects of introspection.  Sometimes the words suggest schizophrenia and other times self-absorption, and yet I sense no self-love, but perhaps self-fascination.  There is also an interesting discussion of the sources of our behavior in \\"The Silent Man.\\"  The words are often highly poetic and euphemistic and yet the sense of intent in these two songs is clear when the words to both songs are read consecutively.  The music is powerful in the first two tracks.  The predominantly acoustic third track contrasts with the first two with its slower pace.  The pace matches the song's topic and location, and serves as an excellent exit to the trilogy of tracks.<br /><br />The following song could have been part of the previous trilogy.  \\"The Mirror\\" is, similar to the previous trilogy, about introspection.  This time the subject is lack of self-control and the recriminations one has toward one's self when your weaknesses overcome your resolve.  The bass crunches most solidly and provides the dark overtone for the other instruments.  This song is serious, bleak and desolate.  How do we keep from falling into our own temptations?  Perhaps this grinding mosh song will start you seeking an answer for you.<br /><br />The bass crunch continues in \\"Lie.\\"  The lyrics to this thundering song initially seemed to belong to the previous four songs.  Then I realized that these songs were not about lying to himself, but about honesty and deception in a relationship with his significant other.  Sometimes I find poetry too dense for my poor brain, and in this case the subtleties of the lyrics were somewhat lost on me.  However, it appears that the singer values honesty, and his significant other is telling him that she is telling him the truth, but there is this doubt, ultimately voiced as cynicism, that plagues his mind.  The line that I find totally outstanding is the final line of this song, \\"I wanna talk about life long mistakes and you can tell your stepfather I said so.\\"  How well can you put into perspective the results of poorly conceived relationships?  The final line of this song speaks encyclopedic volumes, and allows each person to put this song into their own perspective.<br /><br />Then comes a delicate fantasy.  \\"Lifting Shadows off a Dream\\" is a dream.  The keyboards throughout this initially somber andlater exuberant song need to be played loudly to be appreciated.  While I wish the keyboards were more predominant, then they would have been much less ethereal and the song would have had a different flavor.  Once again Dream Theater waxes poetic, eschewing clarity for impressionism and euphemism with substantial progressive overtones that is one of my favorites on this CD.<br /><br />\\"Scarred\\" is the longest song on this CD at nearly eleven minutes.  Once again Dream Theater combines crunchy with munchie as they mix their evocative lyrics with what begins as a blues influenced sound.  I could almost think I was hearing Carlos Santana near the beginning of this song.  However, as the song progresses it takes on dark tones and the song becomes more akin to some of the earlier songs on this CD.  The breadth of influences on this CD is interesting.  In addition to metal, I hear Middle Eastern influences and very melodic harmonies in the refrain.  This song even sounds like a ballad in places, though it is not.  I will not endeavor to interpret the lyrics for this epic song, but they add munchie to the crunchy musical mix.  Eat this song up; you will love it.<br /><br />How do you end a CD like \\"Awake?\\"  How about with a somber love melody that picks at the scars and scabs left by a broken relationship?  I recommend you not listen to \\"Space-Dye Vest\\" when you have problems with your own relationship, because this song will rip your heart out.  The song is definitely about young love, because overlaid on this person's relationship issues are parental comments.  This song is emotionally rending, providing the perfect end to this CD.<br /><br />Is this progressive rock?  Mostly yes.  But who cares?  It is very good.  It is very heavy.  It is emotional.  It will make you feel deep into your soul.  Maybe you will know you better afterward.somber and later exuberant song need to be played loudly to be appreciated.

B0002OERI0|5.0|I love this album.  I play it nearly everyday, puts me in a world of my own while I'm getting on with household stuff.  YES!  I am a 40 year old housewife and mother of 5.  But very young at heart.  My 16 year old son started me listening to Green Day and I can't fault them at all.  Didn't realise they'd been going so long until I saw a music prog on Sky.  Would like to hear more of their stuff.  What more can I say?  Oh yeah, BRILLIANT!!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|What a blast this CD turned out to be!  I haven't been able to see \\"Wicked\\" on stage, but just listening to the fantastic vocals of Idina Menzel and Kristen Chenoweth, oh how I wish I could.  As the Amazon.com reviewer said, the songs from this production are not exactly Cole Porter, but the star turns by Chenoweth and Menzel make some of the mediocre lyrics tolerable. Also great, but often overlooked, is Joel Grey's performance as the Wizard.  His big song, \\"Wonderful\\" is a hoot to listen to.  Among the many songs on this CD \\"Popular,\\" \\"Defying Gravity,\\" and \\"Thank Goodness\\" rank as my favorites.  \\"For Good\\" and \\"As Long as You're Mine\\" are also very good.  For anyone who loved the Wizard of Oz or Gregory Maguire's novel, Wicked, this is a must-have CD.
B0000025RI|5.0|This album was recently certified 27x platinum, congrats to Jackson. <br /> <br />This is my favorite album, the only album i've ever bought that only has 9 tracks. <br /> <br />1. Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'-5/5- great first track, with a great tune.  <br /> <br />2. Baby Be Mine-4/5- I like this song, not exactly my favorite track but still quite good.   <br /> <br />3. The Girl Is Mine-3/5- This was my least favorite, mainly because it didn't really fit the rest of the album.   <br /> <br />4. Thriller-5/5- I really didn't like this song until i saw the video, from then on, i loved it.  <br /> <br />5. Beat It-500/5- my absolute favorite, great tune, great lyrics, and a wonderful video that would go along with it.     <br /> <br />6. Billie Jean  Listen-5/5- Again, classic Jackson, i never liked the video to Billie Jean, but i'm a big fan of the song, because it was just so well written.    <br /> <br />7. Human Nature-5/5- Geez, the hits keep coming from Jackson don't they? Best vocal effort. Lyrics are ok, kind of repetitive, but still sounds great.    <br /> <br />8. P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)-4.5- While still being a very good song, i really didn't like the effort compared to the other songs.     <br /> <br />9. The Lady In My Life-4/5- Not exactly the ending song i was expecting but still good.

B000A2RRF4|3.0|Well, i recorded this on video when it aired on HBO, since the video is getting really terrible (its been over a decade), i bought the DVD. I went to see Jackson in 1988 during his Bad Tour, what difference their is in this concert. Even though the set on the stage is better then the Bad Tour, the effort stinks. Lip-syncing drives me mad. The only song i really can stand now from that concert is Smooth Criminal, while still lip-syncing, that damn tilt he does during the song is unbelievable. Thriller is also nicely done, nice set for that song. Now there are songs he actually sings to, Billie Jean is a complete rip-off, besides the impressive dancing (the moonwalk is always entertaining) the singing is almost non-existent from Jackson, you hear the background singers more then you hear him.  <br /> <br />One thing is for sure, Michael Jackson was definitely at the peak of his popularity, i've never seen an audience so big. Overall, decent, but for those of us that have seen Jackson in his previous tours, knows he has done better, but this is nice to own, since Sony doesn't like releasing any other live concerts from Jackson.
0446677450|1.0|The book has some good points in asset generating income accumulation, but full of fantasies, unrealistic advices, if not illegal (inside stock trade, tax evasion etc), self-conflicting paragraphs, unverifiable facts. RK is  more like an emotion-manipulator, informecial MLM type rather than a financial advisor. It is good entertaining book to kill the time, having some motivational concepts, but all remains are fluff and fantasies. A lot people enjoyed the book because they do not analyze the facts seeing where is fiction where is lies. Is Rich dad is real??. Do you believe in his deals in stocks and real estates, can he give addresses of houses he bought?. His thinking about rich people is child-dish and simple minded. He is selling his father for money, he admires rich dad who is not real. If you want to know more about facts of this book and about author, I recommend you to read in-deep analysis of West Point and Harvard graduate John Reed at his website. John Reed spent a lot of time collecting data and analyzing both the book and author. You can go to Google and typing John Reed Kiyosaki and find in the first search the article \\"John T. Reed's analysis of Robert T. Kiyosaki's book Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\".
B000063DFQ|5.0|arg, everybody said it all already, this is essential metal.  i'd probably say this is one of the heaviest maiden albums, especialy the trooper with the total gallope riff, and my favorite (actualy my favorite maiden song period) Revelations, with its slow hard riff.  some people claim Quest for Fire and Sun and Steel are not as good as the rest of the album, and maybe they aren't, but i still like them.  Quest for Fire is very catchy and also hilarious!  just get it if you dig Maiden and you don't have it yet.  it does get over shadowed by number of the beast and powerslave.
B000A2RRF4|3.0|I think overall this concert is good. The visuals & dancing are top notch. The performance is let down though because Michael doesnt sing many of his songs live. He lip syncs Smooth Criminal, Will You Be there, Thriller, Black or White, Heal The World & Man in the mirror.  <br />     When he does sing live it all seems a bit forced and he sounds like he's straining his voice & his tone & notes suffer greatly because of it (as if he's worn it out over the years or as a result of his surgery!), this is very apparent when he's singing Wanna Be Starting something, Human Nature, Billie Jean, Working Day & Night & Beat It. His best live vocal performances in the concert are I Just Cant Stop Loving You (Sahida Garrat was rubbish though!), She's out of my life & The Jackson 5 medley. <br />    While the overall performance was good, it pales in comparison to his previous Bad Tour - that was MJ at his best (especially in the first leg in Japan) where he sung live while doing all the crazy dance moves, and still sounded good! The dancing was much more fluent and polished to pristine. Im really routing for The Bad tour to be released soon. Give the fans what they want and show the rest of the world how good MJ was in the late 80's! <br /> <br />This is recommended for fans accross the extremity spectrum, adding to your collection & people who want to see a good show.
0451529308|3.0|The book is the coming-of-age story of four sisters. In a very precise way, their lives together are documented in accordance with the times - of what's expected of them as women and what contradictions arise and also social situations that demand attention to several of the sisters.  <br /> <br />The characters are almost unreal - they're so exaggerated that one cannot help to relate SOMEHOW although weakly to any of them. Even the trials and tribulations warrant a very soft feel to them. I found myself emotionally detached to most of the situations and was scanning after near half of the reading and I feel as if I had gotten just as much out of it as I had previously.  <br /> <br />If you're going to read it, be a 7 or 8 year old girl learning the value of friendship and family and other kindly things that involve morals, love, and adaptation to change.  <br /> <br />Otherwise, read Anne of Green Gables instead. It offers just as much and more... esp. with entertaining situations that as compared to the reviewed are so much more the delightful.
0060751967|5.0|Her For Love or Country was a marvel, and this one is just as readable, though entirely different. Roman and Shanna are great characters, and Sparks has developed them fully with both subtle hints and obvious declarations. Sparks writes both laugh-out-loud funny and quietly poignant scenes. The reader really believes in this couple's love, Roman's past, and Shanna's danger. Secondary characters are much more than window dressing, and the world Sparks has created for the vamps is realistic but \\"normal.\\" Very, very likeable story!

0765309408|3.0|There are some really fun bits in this book, but there's definitely something lacking. The good part first: the style is nice, the characters are fairly distinctive, the book reads easily, the pacing is quite good and the starting concept is fascinating. However, things start to fall apart once we get into Starship Troopers/The Forever War territory.  <br /> <br />The concept of recruiting geriatrics in order to fight a war is so full of implications that the entire book could have been written around the social aspects of only that. However, after the first third of the book our 'Old Farts' are in fresh new bodies and acting like 20-year-olds. Not that much of a problem, but it pretty much cuts the legs out from under the book's primary raison d'etre.  <br /> <br />Where things go a bit off the rails is the numerous battle scenes. They're well written, exciting and fun. But they have the exact same problem as the movie Starship Troopers (as opposed to the book) - we're watching vastly futuristic troops fighting with WWII-era tactics. Plus, we're covering the same ground Heinlein did. Not that there's really anything wrong with that, but it's not incredibly interesting the second time around and it's definitely not what the cover and the title promised.  <br /> <br />By the final act we've segued firmly into The Forever War territory, complete with characters questioning the futility of war, the nature of humanity and looking forward to retirement. There's even a completely derivative ending where one character asks another to wait for them so they can retire to the paradise planet and be together forever. Yawn.  <br /> <br />Overall, it's a good read but it doesn't fulfill the promise of it's title. Now, an entire war being run by expendable geriatrics via remote control is a completely different matter and could have made a good book. But that would be some sort of reversed version of Ender's Game and this book is a rehash of Heinlein and Haldeman. Fine if you like that sort of thing (and I do), but nothings particularly original here.
B000002HNR|5.0|\\"Absolutely Live\\" well chronicles The Doors ability as a live band through some of their most blues based songs, as well as long epics displaying Morrison's poetry and the crews overall instrumental talent. Although in some ways misrepresenting the group's efforts in the studio, there is no question that this is an exceptional set of live songs, all performed very well.<br /><br />The opening track entitled \\"House Announcer\\", although obviously not a song, very effectively produces crowd energy, and that energy continues through \\"Who Do You Love?\\", a great Doors rocker. To follow this, The Doors compile a great medley of tracks beginning with Alabama Song. Although the performance lacks contrast to the original recording, it does segue perfectly into the very heavy, bluesy feel of \\"Backdoor Man\\", with Morrison in his loudest lyrical form. \\"Love Hides\\" is a slower paced track, with a great vibe to it. In my opinion, this specific recording of \\"Five To One\\" in many ways totally defeats the studio recording. The guitar solo is performed very cleanly by Krieger. In fact, his guitar sounds very clear throughout this album.<br /><br />Reaching \\"When The Music's Over\\", we get a sensational performance of one of The Doors \\"epic\\" songs. Manzarek's organ is sounding as beautiful as ever, as are Densmore's drums, and Morrison delivers the perfect vocal. \\"Close To You\\" is a nice taste of blues with Ray Manzarek giving a very impressive vocal. \\"Universal Mind\\" seems to be the only song that lacks energy on the track listing, however it is a great soft song, with a deep bluesy feel. Following that up is the introduction to \\"The Soft Parade\\", however the crew doesn't perform the actual song. \\"Dead Cats, Dead Rats\\" is a rather obscure lead-in to \\"Break On Through(To The Otherside)\\", but it works fairly well. As for \\"Break On Through\\", the song rocks out relatively well, however Morrison's vocal is on the lower end. \\"The Celebration Of The Lizard\\" comes next, broken up into short segments, which divide the many different phases of this epic song, which unfortunately The Doors never recorded in the studio. \\"Wake Up\\" is a solid surge of energy, however there are better recordings of this particular section of this song(i.e. \\"Live In New York\\" found in The Doors Box Set). \\"A Little Game\\" is a strong dynamic segment to the epic song, with its continuing building energy in the instruments and Morrison's vocal. \\"Not To Touch The Earth\\" will be the favourite for most fans, myself included. Morrison's poetry ends the song well too in \\"The Palace Of Exile\\". \\"Soul Kitchen\\" is a fantastic closer, with a great all around performance from the group.<br /><br />Overall, in summary this is a great buy for any fan of The Doors, as it definitely gives a good taste of the band as a live act. The performances are all great, with the sound quality and overall edits making it a great listen. Highly recommended to any Doors fan, along with basically any of their studio albums or Greatest Hits compilations.t segments, which divide the many different phases of this epic song, which unfortunately The Doors never recorded in the studio. \\"Wake Up\\" is a solid surge of energy, however there are better recordings of this particular section of this song(i.e. \\"Live In New York\\" found in The Doors Box Set). \\"A Little Game\\" is a strong dynamic segment to the epic song, with its continuing building energy in the instruments and Morrison's vocal. \\"Not To Touch The Earth\\" will be the favourite for most fans, myself included.

0671449028|5.0|I adore this book!   We've gone through several copies with our two children (now ages 5 and 8) and have given it countless times for baby showers, for 1st birthdays and as welcome to the new baby gifts.

B0002V7O3S|4.0|I am tempted to give this movie five stars for one simple reason--the skill that the director has in making you actually feel the scenes on the screen. The first hour and a half of this movie is an exciting tale drawing you into the world of Travis Walton and his friends. The details are superb as you feel like you are one of the men who saw the abduction and then the person who experienced it. I felt my heart race as the abduction story unfolded--the scenes on the alien vessel being truly outstanding. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, for all of the movie's thrills and very in-depth drama, the last fifteen or so minutes is horribly dull and lackluster. While the details leading up to and during the abduction are exciting, the story afterwards falls off into nothingness. The movie becomes long and ends on a note that makes you feel as if the director was rushed on time--or, that the facts of this \\"true story\\" simply ran out. <br /> <br />In any case it is a great theatrical work. The actors and director deserve a commendation for the realism they injected into the movie. Should you rent this movie? If you want ninety minutes of intense detail and suspense, yes. If you expect the story to have any kind of conclusion, try somewhere else.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Although Mrs Gaskell is not my favourite author - it's Jane Austen forever!! - I find her novels quite nice and entertaining. It was some years ago when I read the novel N&S. I liked it but it did not make a lasting impression. I roughly remebered the storyline and that was all. So knowing the novel in itself wouldn't have moved me to purchace the film, but having read the reviews I felt intrigued - better than Mr Darcy/Firth ??!! - and thought I'll give it a try.<br /><br />So yesterday afternoon I thought I'd watch an episode, maybe two, in-between some ironing and ... I ended up watching the whole series in one and didn't do too much ironing.<br /><br />The 1st episode started like a typical costume drama with a wedding party, gossip and dancing: nice but nothing special really. However, when I got to the scene where Margaret is meeting John Thornton for the first time - a dark angel in the \\"white hell\\" - I was completely absorbed by the story.<br /><br />Richard Armitage as Mr Thornton intrigued me from the first (actually I remember preferring this character to Margaret Hale's in the book). He is absolutely wonderful: charismatic, brooding and brutal (ok, I know it's female drooling over him, but I simply can't help it!). And as his character gained more and more dimensions I simply fell in love with him myself. He is upright, honest and despite strict discipline passionate and sensitive. One of my favourite scenes with him - all his scenes are my favourites when I come to think about it! - is when he is watching Margaret depart in the carriage and concetrating his whole being on making her look back ... OOOOHHHHH, his sheer force of concentration/compulsion sent shivers down my spine. I think his character is wonderfully elaborated: starting from the \\"brute\\" beating one of his employees cruelly (though it turns out he has his reasons); the loving son the mother is devoted to; the man suffering to control his unreturned love and passion; the rejected man in love helping Margaret (although he is risking his credibility and reputation as a magistrate) despite his hurt feelings; the employer getting closer to his workers (dining with them together)and a future family man (treating the little orphan kindly). The happy smile (SIGH, SIGH) at the end is as becoming as his brooding before.<br /><br />Richard Armitage (son) and Sinead Cusack (Hannah Thornton, the mother) are simply wonderful together. The strong bond of affection, based on their absolute trust in each other, is almost tangible between them. I think my top favourite scenes are their pas de deux before and after the proposal. They really took my breath away.<br />Daniela is a lovely, sensitive Margaret, though a bit pale and monoton besdide Richard Armitage and Sinead Cusack. However she succeeds in displaying the gradual change of her character: from prejudiced, sophisticated Southerner to a person appreciating people for their true worth not for the (country)sides they represent.<br />Fanny, Thornton's sister is harshly colourful in clothes and vulgar and hilarious in character very suitingly opposed to both her mother & brother and Margaret. Her light touch is very welcome.<br /><br />The minor characters - Margaret's parents, Nicholas & Betsey Higgins, Mr Bell, the other mill owners - play their parts very convincingly.<br /><br />The strong contrasts are everywhere: in scenery, coustumes, colours and music. I think the costumes suited the characters very well - dark, strict colours for John and Hannah Thornton, light and feminine for Margaret, harsh for Fanny. The music is also very moving. The Edinburgh scenery for Milton suits the atmosphere of the series wonderfully.<br /><br />BUY THIS!

0385504209|3.0|Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor of religious symbols, is in Paris to speak at a conference. He is awakened in the middle of the night by the police and taken to a crime scene at the famous art museum, the Louvre, supposedly for his expertise. The curator, Jacques Sauniere, has been murdered but left behind a baffling message. A cryptologist from the Paris Police named Sophia Neveu shows up to decipher the riddle and secretly informs Langdon that he is actually the prime suspect in the curator's death. Both end up on the run trying to stay alive and solve the series of messages and riddles left behind that hopefully lead to the legendary Holy Grail.<br /><br />Initially fast-paced with short chapters that leave you hanging and hints of details which are only alluded to, it's easy to get sucked in by this mysterious thriller. But the use of this style quickly feels over-used and becomes rather annoying as the action continually shifts back and forth between Langdon and Neveu, Silas the albino monk, and Bezu Fache the police chief, as well as others whose link to the story is unclear.<br /><br />This book has enjoyed such huge popularity that while reading it I was regularly approached by people at work and even on the street who'd tell me it was their \\"favorite\\" book. Part of this popularity perhaps stems from the controversial religious nature, and I imagine many Catholics could easily feel offended by the harsh portrayal of the history of their church (the author makes no distinction between Catholics and Christians; to him Catholicism IS Christianity, or at least a very corrupted form of it). While I wasn't \\"shocked\\" or offended (or even surprised) by some of the more controversial issues raised, I was disappointed with the portrayal of Jesus as essentially a pagan, saying that his miracles and divinity were mere fables invented by the Catholic Church to gain control over the people. And while I realize it's just a fictional novel, as was stressed to me by many of its fans, many facts (or at least widely held theories) are mingled so heavily in the story that it becomes hard to sort out what isn't real, lending an air of credibility to the fiction.<br /><br />Overall, an interesting mystery, but certainly not my \\"favorite\\" book.many facts (or at least widely held theories) are mingled so heavily in the story that it becomes hard to sort out what isn't real, lending an air of credibility to the fiction.

B000089RVX|5.0|With over two hundred reviews already in the can, why should I bother writing one?  Because I cannot keep this excitement to myself... years after its release, I decided to give Evanescence a chance and borrowed the album from the library.  I had heard \\"Bring Me To Life\\" due to the movie \\"Daredevil\\" in the past, and liked the song, but never ventured further.  I put the CD in, heard about 8 seconds of track one, and was blown away.  \\"Going Under\\" was an amazing start to what is now one of my favorite albums of all time.  As with many popular artists that get overplayed or over-hyped, Evanescence seems to have turned some people away or even vehemently against the act.  But let us take a quick look at the music behind the unjustly maligned band.<br /><br />Goth communities shun this band and call them metal or pop, average listeners may call them goth-rock, or a variety of other labels.  It doesn't really matter to me since I actually am a big fan of techno, pop, and some rock.  Evanescence appeals to me because of the genuine emotion delivered by powerful vocalist Amy Lee.  Lee reminds me of my other favorite female vocalist, Beth Gibbons of Portishead, who carries every fiber of emotion in the delivery.  We've all been there; depressed, in love, insecure, etc... this album takes us on a journey we can all relate to, and sing along with.  Surprisingly, the earlier material by this band is mellower and less produced, and at times reminds me of the band The Cranberries.  I like both angles, and use \\"Fallen\\" for times of energetic expression, and the earlier content for more reserved low-key moments.  I particularly enjoy the occasional choir background or touch of strings or piano in \\"Fallen,\\" which add an almost cinematic feel to these emotional pieces.  The audio samples here should give you a decent dose of what to expect, but I just had to add a few words and cast a 5-star vote for this incredible act, and album.  Highlights for me are \\"Going Under,\\" \\"Haunted,\\" and \\"Tourniquet.\\"  \\"Fallen\\" is a tight package of well-produced memorable songs with the right amount of edge without being too heavy for my taste.  To put it simply, it rulz!ourniquet.\\"   \\"Fallen\\" is a tight package of well-produced memorable songs with the right amount of edge without being too heavy for my taste.

B0000DZ3EN|4.0|A lot of people have problems with RETURN TO OZ, and most of them stem from watching the MGM version of THE WIZARD OF OZ too many times. Let's get things settled right from the outset: if you are looking for another singing Oz where absolutely nothing horrible really happens, RETURN TO OZ is not for you. RETURN TO OZ is a much darker interpretation of the beloved fairyland, and perhaps just a bit closer to something that L. Frank Baum and Ruth Plumly Thompson would appreciate.<br /><br />The story centers around Dorothy returning to Oz to find all of her friends in trouble from both Mombi and the Nome King. New characters join Dorothy in her travels from the Emerald City to the Nome King's Mountain, including Billina the Kansas farm-hen, Tik-Tok, the Royal Army of Oz, Jack Pumpkinhead, and the Gump. Fans of the Oz books will love the fact that these characters all closely resemble the way John R. Neill envisioned them. (There's even a scene containing such famed Oz celebrities as Scraps the Patchwork Girl, the Frogman, Shaggy Man, the Braided Man of Pyramid Mountain, Notta Bit More the clown, and even Ojo and Unc Nunkie in the background of one shot. Also, see if you can spot the Li-Mon-Eag in the opening Emerald City shots!)<br /><br />The plotline is a strange mix of THE LAND OF OZ and OZMA OF OZ, and certain elements are intertwined to make the story flow a bit more. Mombi and Princess Langwidere have been merged to form one character; the wheelers are working for Mombi instead of being merely mischeivious characters.<br /><br />How is it content-wise? Granted, parents should view first and determine whether their children will be able to handle some of the more frightening scenes in the movie, which mainly center around Dorothy in Kansas at a creepy hospital and when she is dealing with the headless Mombi. There is no language, no sexual content of any kind. The main concern is the scary factor.<br /><br />This particular edition of the DVD contains some extras, including an interview with Fairuza Balk (Dorothy), TV spots from the 80's, and the original trailer. The movie is also dubbed in French. The DVD design is a little tacky, with the Tin Woodman on the front cover, who isn't even in the movie for a minute, and Dorothy looks incredibly odd on the cover and DVD label.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a great fantasy movie (for the kids or for yourself) or if you're a fan of the books, then stop singing along with Judy Garland and pick up RETURN TO OZ for a thrilling couple hours of Oz.extras, including an interview with Fairuza Balk (Dorothy), TV spots from the 80's, and the original trailer.

B000055ZB8|4.0|DVD players are so expensive! When I purchased one, I realized I needed to stock up on DVD's to get my money's worth. My child of 5 years was bored with all the baby movies I ordered, so I decided to buy this masterpiece. We watched the movie together on Halloween night, and she hasn't been able to sleep ever since. I tried putting pictures of the various scenes from the movie up on her bedroom walls, but it has just intensified the crying/screaming. Oh well, it was her fault for watching the movie. I loved it! <br /> <br />
B0000TB01Y|3.0|If you loved Titanic (the movie) and believe that Phantom and Les Miz are the best musicals ever, run out and buy Wicked - it will appeal to you greatly.  If you are not a fan of American Idol style power ballads, you may find Wicked to be a bit erratic in quality and impact.      When the cast are allowed to shine in individual numbers or duets  and the humor comes through (particulary in less \\"show-stopping\\" numbers like \\"Popular\\" or \\"What is this feeling\\"), the soundtrack is wonderful, and the same could be said of the live performance. The powerhouse numbers \\"Defying Gravity\\" and \\"For Good\\" are also memorable, if slightly overwrought (in particular, the lyrics of for good seem to try force imagery ham-handedly).      In general, the group numbers are incredibly overblown.  I found them both difficult to listen to and difficult to sit through.  I found myself comparing them to numbers from the parody musical \\"Elephant!\\" from the movie the Tall Guy.     My primary complaint is that the plot seemed significantly dumbed down for a general audience from the political and social satire in the book.  Making the book palatable and nonoffensive seems to reflect in much of the music.  To generalize, the individual songs, moments and performances are very good and often spectacular.  The orchestrations and crowd scenes are far less so and occasionally parody worthy.  Overall, Wicked is a worth a listen for many wonderful moments, but it will not go down as one of the great scores of all time.

It doesn't seem like this is the strength of what the band does but most of the songs on the album are actually pretty good. I don't think that the album is as strong as their first 2 but it is definately worth a buy.<br /><br />Track 5 is brillaint and tracks 9 and 10 stand out as well. This album feels a lot more like a White Stripe-ish or Soledad Brothers kind of sound than what BRMC has done in the past. Be sure to take a listen to the album before you buy it if you are planning on just buying based on past albums they've done.<br /><br />BIG caveat, this is one of Song-BMG's new copy protected albums and it will not natively copy to iTunes or an iPod in Windows. It also will not play on your computer w/o installing some goffy software so if you are getting this for your iPod be warned.
0142000663|2.0|Ah yes, The Grapes of Wrath, a true \\"American classic.\\" Yeah, it appeals to the migrant worker in all of us. Unfortunately, the thing will take you about three years to read due to it's excessively boring, uneventful passages and, unless you're Jeff Foxworthy, impossible to decipher Southern dialect. So the Joads go from job to job, making a nickel a day. And then they lose their jobs and go to another job. This continues for the first 400 pages. Finally,if you are able to survive that ordeal, you reach the final ten pages, waiting for the killer, \\"Boo Radley is a nice guy\\"-esque ending. Nothing. In the end, they are still poor and desperate. I suppose that in its time this book was a revelation of sorts, exposing the pathetic conditions in which the average man toiled in during the Great Depression. Now? It's an easy cure for any insomniac, as it will bore you to death with its monotony. Classic, schmassic. Pantheon, smchantheon.
1932907009|5.0|A fast-paced and entertaining read, this book could help you look at your craft in a whole new way.<br /><br />This is a book that doesn't get bogged down in rules and formulas. The funny thing about it is that it all feels like common sense... except it's \\"common sense\\" that most of us haven't thought about before!  How do you make a \\"tough guy\\" character likeable?  How do you paint mental pictures when pitching a script? Practical answers abound in this book.<br /><br />Blake is a guy who really, seriously walks up to total strangers and says, \\"Hi. I have an idea for a movie. Can I tell you about it and you tell me what you think of it?\\" He does this even though he's already sold million-dollar scripts to Disney and Spielberg.  It's this never-ending quest to learn more about the audience and more about what makes movies work that is so clear in Blake's book.<br /><br />He does an excellent job of explaining things in ways that'll stick in your mind-- funny little phrases and lists that are off-beat enough, yet simple enough to remember while you're plotting out your next script.  I felt like I was in the hands of a very capable teacher, and a real pro.<br /><br />No matter how many (or how few) screenwriting books you've read, this one is worth buying. It offers a valuable perspective from a writer who is eager to share, never condescending, and knows his stuff.  I give it two thumbs up!
B0009S4IHY|4.0|I saw this movie in the theaters twice and loved it both times. It has a lot of comedy, tight graphics, and even though it does have subtitles you get used to them afterwhile. Definitely one of the best comedy/action moives that have come out recently.
B000A88F22|1.0|Anyone who says this show is entertaining is a liar, please, the little kids on 'out of the box' are way more intelligent than Britney and her retarded husband. I would never criticize anything without giving it a chance so I made sure I watched the 1st episode of this tragic series. Now her fans get the pleasure of watching her act like a pig, which obviously comes natural to her. Brit asks her friends 'What is your favourite  <br />s-- position?'(WHO CARES?!). JC Chasez nearly dies of embarrassment when asked himself, frankly, he deserves it, do u remember his HORRIFIC attempts at going solo (I apologise if I've induced any nightmares). Brit tells us how much she loves her family and friends (MOST PEOPLE DO, GENIOUS!)+ her 40 year old assistant tells us love is important to her (HOW GRIPPING!). If u have trouble sleeping, then u should definetly watch ' B + K Chaotic'. Brit's realized this is her last chance to cheat her fans one last time before they desert her. Brit's entire career is based 100% on image, no man/women (however desperate) wants to see an overweight, slob dance in their underwear. Brit has sunk a new low, only a truly desparate celebrity would agree to do a reality T.V show. Can u imagine Whitney Houston participating in such a pathetic programme? Exactly.  To summarize, Britney is a tacky redneck loser.
B0007GAERG|1.0|Wow, is all I can say to the many people that are giving this cd 5 stars. Don't get me wrong, Mariah back in the day was fire!, she could sing good, and she looked great. But come on now people really, you hopeless Mariah fans who were desperately waiting for her to make a comeback got exactly what you wanted. An overrated sorry excuse for a quality cd. And that's not even mentioning her voice!!! AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO HEARD HER SING ON THE AWARDS SHOW? You cannot tell me this girl can sing anymore! For crying out loud, she had a backup track on the VMA's!     The high pitched note that she overly uses throughout the album is nothing more than annoying now. Her shifiting in sining between her full and soft voice is overused. The song material has gone downhill for example the whole \\"It's like that\\" song. Really the only thing good on this album she did was hire producer Jermaine Dupri who helped give her some decent beats.     Its sad to see these great artist of their time try to come back as if they are reinvented but really all they do is sell themesleves out to try to fit into the younger crowd that is dominating the industry. They begin to loose the very thing they had that made them special in the first place, and result in tasteless activity to try to recapture their youth, and the youth of today.       Go spend your money on something else actually worth listening to with good singing, quality beats, and meaningful songs...like the Raheem DeVaughn cd or MaryMary (now them sistas can sang)! Or if your really looking to treat yourself pick up that new Kanye West (late registration)...the best album of '05 by far, 1st week 860,000 sold and counting.
B000001F9N|4.0|As 2nd albums are called this \\"sophmore\\" effort showed that Donna was far from a \\"flash-in-the-pan\\" Disco Star who would come and go quickly. When your first big hit is a novelty sound such as Love To Love You Baby, many wonder if you can move on from that.<br /><br />Donna continued to move forward with Love Trilogy, yet the album contained more of an erotic undercurrent than her first domestic release.  On the LTLYB album, side 2 portrayed a more diverse side of Donna where on this release side 2 continued with the sensual side of things. Her steamy reworking of Could It Be Magic (much steamier than the live read that she does today), and the tracks Wasted, and Come With Me feed into her developing image as a Disco Sex Kitten.<br /><br />This album gave Donna her second gold single (Try Me, I Know We Can Make It), and her second gold album.<br /><br />I would have loved this release even more if more of Donna diverse talent was allowed to be exposed.
B000000WJZ|5.0|I dont care if you guys agree with me or not, some of you may say ABBIE ROAD from the beatles or DARK SIDE OF THE MOON from  Pink Floyd or NEVERMIND from Nirvana but I say SIAMESE DREAM from SMASHING PUMPKINS. All the tracks are pure bliss, not one single track sucks, unlike Mellion collie and adore(which I also like)has its weak points and of course Machina which has like 3 good songs but not this album, every song in here is good. Listen to each track at least twice and you will be hooked. Almost 408 reviewers liked it. I like the odds of that.
0385510454|4.0|Many have expressed disappointment with the slow plot development or the lack of action through most of the book.  I believe Grisham often does his character development with a long familiarization.  I enjoyed this book tremendously.  The plot was rich in sights and sounds during the character development.  I really enjoyed touring Italy's sights, restaurants and expresso bars.  I think Grisham has a sneeky way of building tension gradually.  Backman was an unsavory unlikely hero at first.  He was reduced from a life of wild excesses to the minimal existence of a marked man.  You had the feeling that he really changed over the pages.  This was not a thrill a minute read but I've read those. Grisham's strength is in revealing the character of a man through his personal challenges.  I recommend this book.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Horrible Keanu Reeves action film that is as bad as the word of mouth suggests. Keanu was miscast and he gives the worse performance I have seen him give in quite a long time. He is so bad that he even makes the dumb script with the horrible dialog look good in comparison to his performance. The script is so poorly written that you will be astounded at the dialog that is spoken by the characters in this film and the plot really does not make a lot of sense once you try to put two and two together. Rachel Weisz does in fact give a riveting and haunting performance but she's the only actor in the film who dares to give one while the rest of the actors in the film camp it up to the point of nausea. The visual effects are a let down compared to the films that have come out recently in the cinema and they get repetitive after a while.  The direction is a joke with certain scenes that are shot so poorly that you have no idea on what is going on from scene to scene. A better director would have tried to make some sense on what was happing but this director only adds to the confusion that is already in the script. If you like to make fun of bad movies, then this movie is for you because other than Weisz's gutsy and complex performance, the movie has nothing to offer in the form of real entertainment.  <br /> <br />Hats off to Rachel Weisz for at least doing her best with what was giving to her but I can't say the same for the movie itself.  <br /> <br />
B0009K7QZ8|1.0|The first season of this show was pretty good. I never thought it was anything to spectacular, but I still watched because the characters were addictive (plus Rachel Bilson's hot) The second season is nothing even worth watching.  I hated it.  The story was boring and absolutely pointless.  They didn't give us anything new.  It was basically the season one plot thrown around between characters.  In season two, Julie had an affair with Jimmy instead of Luke.  Kirsten and Sandy had marital problems...again.  They both ALMOST cheated on each other...again.  Ryan and Marissa were dramatic about their relationship...again.  Seth's character was no longer funny, but annoying.  And Summer was just stupid. (\\"I love Seth, I hate Seth\\") The plot was thin and the drama was thinner.  The story was stupid and dull.  Leave Season Two out of the collection.  It sucked!
B00005JOGE|5.0|Well, Live 8 was the best 8 hours of my life, that i can honestly say. I don't know whether it was the relief of finally being there after all the anticipation, the fact that everyone wouod be jealous, the amazing acts or the size of the event but it was incredible. All of the acts (even velvet revolver who were not my favourite, by far) were amazing. The only downfall was that i had to leave before Pink Flyd and the Who to catch my late train. But, that's why the DVD is going to be good! I think i'd buy it for the pure novelty of spending 12 hours trying to find the dot of my head in the crowd but for everyone else the quality of the songs and speeches is enough to buy this dvd, so do it! And help charity while doing it x
B00079FUI6|2.0|Desperate Housewives was a fun little show in the beginning, but as the season went on, the comedy lacked and got repetative.  How many times can Susan fall on her face?  How many times can Lynette yell at her kids? How many times can Bree clean? How many times can Edie flirt? How many times can Gabrielle complain about money?  It got very dull. <br /> <br />   Also, every plot twist that they threw at us was very predictable.  Half the things they told us at the end of the season were things I predicted in the very first episode.  Also, the mystery throughout the season got very over dramatic.  It was too dramatic to be a dramedy (drama-comedy).  Plus, the answers that were given were very disappointing.  It wasn't worth watching the whole season.  Plus, there was no cliffhanger. <br /> <br />  What bugs me even more than the lack of entertainment that this show has to offer is how big a deal people make about Terri Hatcher.  She isn't very good compared to the other women.  I think that Felicity Huffman is phenominal along with Eva and Marcia. <br /> <br />  I would leave this one to the rental stores.  It isn't something worth watching over and over again.  Save your money.
B000000P17|2.0|I'll give it 2 stars for GNR being a great rock band when they want to be and good musicians, but there was no reason for this mess to be recorded. They did so much of this over their career, recording meaningless covers and EPs because they couldn't get their act together and record a real record. Except for maybe \\"Down on the Farm\\", this is a collection of boring covers of mostly boring songs. Another vanity project from Axl to suck money out of fans to fund his never-ending Chinese Democracy.
B00006AW2G|1.0|What? They arn't the best rock band in the world. The only rock<br /><br />songs that rock are Start Me Up and Shattered. What's the point?<br /><br />They used to play punk back in the 60's. They were never the best<br /><br />rock band in the world. Or maybe they are, they are a great band<br /><br />but they are way better than the Who. The Beatles suck!
B000AMWIVM|4.0|in response to what the person above me said about protesting a second release, well thats fine and dandy but, if your smart like me, then you would of known that they were going to release a seperate special edition later on(like I suspected and didnt buy it when it came out and waited) instead of whinning about it. cause most people do that especially with popular movies or movies that are going to be a sequel or remake so keep this in mind next time. as for my review on the movie, its one of the most original horror films ive seen, great mixure of seven and silence of the lambs with a great twist. cant wait for the second one.
B000000W5P|5.0|Check it out, Shattered is one of my top 10 songs on my list.<br /><br />And this album is great because I dont have to review about the<br /><br />greatest rock band in the world. This and Tatto you you never<br /><br />will say review about the best rock band in the world. This<br /><br />is one of the most rock songs on the world. SHATTERED ROCKS THE<br /><br />WHOLE GOD DAMN WORLD GREAT!!! This is lust and food and violence.
0767836324|2.0|...when you propose the ultimately silly story idea of \\"what would happen if Peter Pan grew up?\\", even the legendary director cannot save the inevitable answer from being...    WHO CARES!!!
B000000W5F|5.0|Nope, I will never write a review about the Stones not being the<br /><br />greatest rock band in the world. because this has Start Me Up.<br /><br />Start Me Up and Shattered I told you were the Rolling Stones'<br /><br />only good songs.
B00002E23E|4.0|Ah, the wonderful memories of midnight madness movies!  ROCKY HORROR, PINK FLOYD THE WALL, and this.  A strikingly visual Led-Zeppelin concert experience, filmed like a real motion picture and not a typical concert video.  No other band has ever duplicated themselves on film like this, and they probably never will.  Just hearing the long, live version of \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" is worth it all.    Bring back the midnight concert movies!!!
B000000W5L|1.0|What? They arn't the best rock band in the world. The only rock<br /><br />songs that rock are Start Me Up and Shattered. What's the point?<br /><br />They used to play punk back in the 60's. They were never the<br /><br />best rock band in the world.

B00004YKUY|4.0|Okay, so all of us Journey fans don't like it that Steve Perry is no longer with the band.  Well, guess what...we didn't like it when David Lee Roth was no longer with Van Halen either, but the band moved on and we moved on with them.    As a die hard Journey fan, you either love it or hate it that replacement singer Steve Augeri sounds just like Perry.  Personally, I love it!  It keeps the classic sound alive and makes the new songs on \\"Arrival\\" all the more enjoyable.  This album sounds a lot more like the trademark sound of the band, with its mixes of hard rock and power ballads, than 1986's \\"Raised On Radio\\", which I consider the weakest album of their career.    I saw them in 1986 and again in 2001 with Peter Frampton opening.  You gotta love that kind of lineup!  I'll have the pleasure of a third go around this Sunday night at Jones Beach, Long Island.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|Avenged Sevenfold became my favorite band once I bought Waking the Fallen. The screaming had many variations and guitar and drumming were creative so no songs sounded alike. I was disapointed when I found out that the lead singer busted his vocal chords. THAT'S WHY THERE IS NO SCREAMING IN THIS ALBUM. Other than that, this album is pretty good in spite of his girly singing. The instruments are still creative, though in a different style from Waking the Fallen (which is a very good album). Some songs I really don't like though (Thrashed and Scattered, Strength of the World)
B00000G3PL|5.0|If you want a some a good, funny film for the real guy in your life. Then you should think about getting these films for them.
B0002OERI0|3.0|now the following review comes from a serious metal fan who wanted to check out one of the more popular cds of the year. first of all, every single from this cd is OVERPLAYED. american idiot and boulevard of broken dreams are both good songs that the radio pretty much destroyed. the wierd thing about this cd is that it revolves around a central theme of \\"saint jimmy\\". the whole cd in order tells kind of a story in a way. its kind of a cool thing but gets very old towards the end. song of the songs here are basically the same except one is your normal distortion induced punk song and the other is a from-the-heart ballad, but they contain the same lyrics! another weird thing, a few songs are dvided up into like 4 or 5 smaller songs, the whole thing ending up 10 minutes long. not a big fan of that. the first few songs are pretty much what this cd is. the rest is basically repeating that.  <br /> <br />overall, if your a fan of punk/greenday pick this one up. if your a fan a metal and are thinking of picking this up so you know what all your punk loving friends are talking about... rethink your strategy.
0385338686|4.0|I sped through this book -- my first by this author.  I used to be a \\"city attorney\\" and I felt like Kinsella must have been spying on me to get it so right. The hours, the messy desk, the partners, the lack of a personal life, everything.  The character's abrupt change of occupation might have seemed far-fetched in a lesser author's hands but I thought Kinsella wrote it all with great humor and believability.
B0002OERI0|2.0|greenday used to be good. all their other albums have been great but this one...oh this is just crap. they went mainstream. half of these teeny bopper kids didn't even know who greenday was a year ago! its completely insane. boulevard of broken dreams is probably the worst song by greenday i have ever heard. its not like them at all. i'm disapointed.
1401301010|5.0|A must have for true Pepper fans. I could not put this book down. An in depth view of the journey of not only Anthony but the entire brotherhood of RHCP.Blood Sugar has not left my cd player since its release (no joke) and I grabbed this book the day it was released,finished it in 2 days and have read it about 6 times over. You'll go thru the ups and downs of an incredible band ,terrible loses and miraculous returns.Turn off the TV, kill the phone, call in sick, get but neked and put the sock on!
B000002MY3|5.0|This is such a great album. All of the songs are just wonderful. When I'm mad I always listen to it and sing a long and get out all my frustration. Alanis is my idol. She writes such wonderful songs and sings them with so much feeling. I reccomend this cd to everyone.
B000000OAN|5.0|This is it, folks!  Rock has seen no finer!  &quot;A Night at The Opera&quot; is an event, not the release of more &quot;product&quot;.  It showcased exactly what Queen could do with the best of their abilities.  Ask yourself what other CD you can get &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; and &quot;The Prophet's Song&quot; on?  Each song on this CD is special in its own way.  If you are a serious music fan, this is a must!  You're definately NOT a Queen fan if you do not own this.  God Save The Queen!
B000002JOH|5.0|Vinnie did not die, you goof, it was Dimebag. Get your fact straight before you post or it will make you look like a moron. Wait, it already did. <br /> <br />Next to CFH, VDOP is my fav. metal album. Walk is a courage builder that makes you say \\"I don't give a F***!\\" Hallow is the best on this album.
B000A0GP0Y|5.0|It was sooooooo funny when I saw it in theaters; I cant wait till it comes out on dvd!
B0006M4SO6|1.0|I've been follow this guy since the early 80's and absolutely love 90% of what he has done. But this piece of work is, well, less than up to par. If any one remembers \\"Zero Tolerance For Silence\\" think of that only toned down with the entire PMG. Or maybe a better analogy would be a bad 70's fusion / acid jazz band that can't seem to find any soul or direction. This CD just goes nowhere. Every time I think it's going to get better it doesn't. It just rambles off on another tangent only to get lost in the mish mosh of what sounds like musicians hoping to find some sense of unity. They don't. It's almost like they are trying to pull together past sounds from previous albums and just going for it saying \\"OK, lets try this..\\"....\\"Nah nah, that doesn't work....how about this?!\\".....\\"Nah nah....that doesn't work either\\".....Etc etc. Too bad Pat, I'm starting to lose faith......
B0007GAERG|5.0|Please ignore any postings about this album needing a \\"Parental Advisory\\" sticker.  If the folks had actually listened to the album, they would be well aware that all profanities are edited out! <br /> <br />That being said, the album was great!
B0009KA7BS|3.0|Well, movies about angels and demons don't push my buttons.  Lately, I haven't had too much patience with Keanu Reeve's work.  But I was surprised to discover this movie was enjoyable. <br /> <br />Best of all was Rachel Weisz.  She is an underused actress working in films today.  Which is a shame because she is fun to watch and very generous with her costars. Her role as a detective discovering a hidden talent and investigating her sister's murder was very believable.  <br /> <br />Reeves is a very reticent and private actor.  Not many of his female costars break thru with him.  Moss almost did in the Matrix films.  But in this film, Keanu perks up and responds to Weisz whenever she enters the frame.  They have fantastic chemistry and it was great watching the emerging relationship between their characters.   <br /> <br />Rachel Weisz brings out the best in Keanu Reeves and I hope that they work together again.  If it has to be a Constantine sequel so be it.  But a comedy would fit them both very well.  Reeves has shown himself to be a deft comedian in the past.  But he has been avoiding the genre. And Weisz lit up the whole Mummy franchise.   <br /> <br />The rest of the cast was fantastic also.  Shia LaBeouf is turning into a very nice actor,Dijmon Hounsou is a blast as a witch doctor, Tilda Swinton is eerie as an angel gone mad and Peter Stormare just rocks as the Prince of Darkness.  Also, will someone use Pruitt Taylor Vance in a good role already!  I know his eye trick is fascinating but he is a great actor also. <br /> <br />The special effects were wonderful and some of the scenes were quite beautiful. <br /> <br />It was nice escapist fun.
0393035158|4.0|Bottom line: this book, while not perfect, is worth reading.   <br /> <br />It provokes important debate.  It could be many things it is not: more comprehensive, more cohesive, more engaging, easier to read, more scholarly, less academic, more politically correct, less ambivalent, and so on.  A quick scan of other reviews finds ample nit-picking along those lines. But that's missing the point. Is is worth reading? Yes.  Is it carefully written, thoughtful, and well intentioned?  Yes. <br /> <br />The book is bound to make wounded athiests take cheer, religious believers defensive and dismissive, cynics regard the call for rational debate as futile.  I don't care--I still think they should read it, and attempt to be open minded as they do. <br /> <br />So many are quick to overlook the essence of the book based upon whether they agree with either the points or the methodology, and that is a shame.   <br /> <br />How could anyone disagree with the call for rational discussion of how we can keep from blowing ourselves up?  Whatever the role of faith when it comes to \\"bad things\\" (witch hunts, pogroms, suicide bombings, etc.), both historically and moving forward, we at least ought to be talking about it.  In this book, Harris is getting the ball rolling.  Let's read it and keep talking. <br /> <br />This may be a simplistic reading of Harris's intent, but I do think he is not grinding an athiestic axe.  His point is, rather, that it seems at least a reasonable hypothesis that maybe, just maybe, \\"faith\\" without reason, enables many of these \\"bad things\\" to happen with sanction.  He spends probably too much of the book for my taste pointing out examples that would support the hypothesis, picking on a variety of religions, not just Islam.  Because he is not comprehensive and uniform, he has come under criticism and been accused of bias, but then again, this book is not 50,000 pages long.  The way I see it, he wanted to supply at least enough examples, from a wide enough variety of sources, to justify that the hypothesis bears close scrutiny. <br /> <br />Coupled with the observation that technology is ever making it more, not less likely, that the degree of harm which one person can inflict is growing exponentially, gives the debate an urgent context. <br /> <br />To summarize, I see Harris saying--hey let's debate this stuff.  I don't see him saying--here's the answer, there is no debate.  I agree--let's be open minded and reasonable, and talk about what we want for our future.   <br /> <br />I don't know about you, but whether or not I believe in heaven, hell, or reincarnation, I still don't want as part of my, and especially my son's, future: <br /> <br />another 9/11, or 3/11, etc. terrorist attack <br />a war on Islam <br />a jihad against non-Islam <br />a nuclear detonation <br /> <br />And yet, given the track we're on (\\"we\\" being the body of humanity), I expect and fear that we will see all of them.  At least if we don't figure out how to avoid them.  And that can only come through rational debate.  And that, I see, is the point of this book. <br /> <br />So please read it.  And try to keep an open mind.  Thank you.
0807262013|5.0|Over the past thirty years I have read over 2,500 science fiction and fantasy novels.  This trilogy ranks among the best of them.  I was very sorry to see that the first two reviews basically trashed this novel, not on its literary value but because of the reviewers' own religious views.  Science fiction and fantasy novels are about escape from reality, not religion.  These novels take place in alternate dimensions - why bring Christianity into them?  The books are well written, with a gripping plot, credible characters, and new concepts to the sagging fantasy world, such as external souls with their own personalities and morals.  Is this a Christian concept?  I'm not mentioning my own religion here, because it simply isn't relevant to the literary value of this wonderful series.  If you can't separate fiction from reality (or your own personal beliefs), you have no business reading fiction of any sort.  You also have no business watching television at all or reading the newspaper - yellow journalism exists (and is fiction).  Don't allow the reviewers' own insecurity about their religious beliefs stop you from enjoying a superb fantasy.
B0002GTWQA|3.0|This movie is like Lawrence of Arabia, just substitute the desert for sea, the story is alright (good), but not as classic as O'toole's performance in Lawrence of Arabia. In lord Jim O'toole is tormented by abandoning ship and spends the rest of the move trying to redeem  himself. O'toole's is good and very believable as Lord Jim, the cinematography is beautiful but the story is lacking.......... <br />*****DO Not READ AHEAD/ PLOT SPOILER*****The ending was very weird, it's like O'toole's character Jim wanted to die. It seemed that no matter what he did,  he could never  redeem himself .  <br />
B00003CX5P|1.0|This movie is so horrendous, I could go on for hours! The lifeless cast must have gone to the Acting School for Wooden Indians, pretty sad when a completely digital character(Jar Jar Stinks)seems more alive and interesting, and the brain squishing script left me cringing in horror. There are too many CGI  things flying around on the screen it became quite irritating, this is the quintessential blueprint film for people with ADD(crisis every 5 min) and is a nightmare for anyone with an IQ over 80. Lets not forget the racism; Mexicans, Blacks, Asians play all the shady/weird characters in the film. I'm white and I noticed this.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Michael Buble is a very talented man with an amazing voice.  His voice can either make you cry or make you want to jump up and dance!  This proves that you don't have to be \\"old\\" to enjoy music from a man with a voice that does Sinatra proud. (I am only 23!)  This is a great follow up to his 1st CD!!!!
B00006AW2J|5.0|A dynasty means a ruling family or a multi-championship sports team but how about a rock n' roll band? If such a thing exists then the period of 1968-1973 was a dynasty for the Rolling Stones, a period of unmatched excellence not only in recorded output but also as a touring band. \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" and the album it was originally intended for 'Beggars Banquet' began this glorious run. 'Banquet' was delayed until November of 1968, and the wait was well worth it. The \\"comeback\\" from psychedelia was complete and the Stones had their first undisputed masterpiece. 'Banquet' was a milestone for many reasons not the least of which were the last meaningful contributions of Brian Jones. His slide playing on \\"No Expectations\\" is so painfully beautiful it almost represents his desperate plight to remain relevant in the band. \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" needs very little input from me as to its merits as one of rock's alltime greatest songs but allow me to anyway; the ecstatic congas, rollicking piano, incessant bass, diabolic vocals and lyrics, Keith's blitering lead guitar and finally the voodoo chants (allegedly inspired by Keith's witchy woman Anita Pallenberg) to give this magnum opus its final satanic sheen. Controversy would follow not only from 'Sympathy' but the album's most famous other song, \\"Street Fighting Man\\", almost a blueprint for rock n' roll attitude. The blues is everywhere on this record: \\"Prodigal Son\\", \\"Parachute Woman\\", \\"Jig-saw Puzzle\\" (awesome lyrics here \\"bloody curdling tally-ho\\" indeed!!), \\"Factory Girl (sublime!!)\\" and \\"Dear Doctor\\" are all a much beloved part of my musical upbringing and also reminding the world what the Stones did better than anyone. \\"Stray Cat Blues\\" is the greatest underage groupie sex song ever and another triumph and probably my personal favorite. \\"Salt of the Earth\\" closes this predominately working class album in fine fashion with nice gospel chorus finish. The rest as they say is history and I think it can be fair to say that this album as much as 'Satisfaction' is most responsible for the Stones legendary and long lasting success, or is it the next album.....
B0006GAOCW|3.0|I remember when I first heard about this movie several years ago, about how it was the brainchild of Jerry O'Connell, that goofy guy from equally goofy movies like Kangaroo Jack and Tomcats. When I finally saw this movie, I realized that I couldn't expect anything less from Jerry O'Connell. I'm not quite sure if that's a compliment... but I still enjoyed this movie. It's very formula, very sappy, yet there's something about Katie Holmes and Marc Blucas that just sorta clicked.  <br /> <br />This is a sweet little movie about daddy's (the President's) little girl, who just wants to have a normal life without the photographers or the swarming secret service. Her respite is a college 3,000 miles away from that big, white house she lives in. Her conflicts include a jealous roommate who's used to being the center of attention, bad press because of her \\"crazy\\" behavior at a couple of parties, and meeting and falling for the totally hot resident advisor (Blucas). Michael Keaton co-stars as the President and Jerry O'Connell provides an unneeded, extremely cheesy narration at the beginning and end.  <br /> <br />Yes, this movie is very similar to Chasing Libery, a film that I actually like better, mainly because Mandy Moore's turn as the First Daughter had more punch and less sap. The one thing I liked better about First Daughter is the way the \\"big twist\\" is handled, which I won't giveaway here... though I will say that in First Daughter I was surprised and in Chasing Liberty I expected it. I probably didn't expect the twist in this movie because I had already seen it once and didn't think the movies would be quite that similar, but oh well, it was handled better here. Added all up, however, Chasing Liberty wins... but certainly don't ignore this one. It's kinda cute and kinda funny and just the perfect remedy for a dull Friday night for you to curl up on the couch and eat ice cream. RECOMMENDED.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|If you buy this, get the uncensored version by all means!  If you're going to watch raunchiness, then watch it uncensored!  I can't believe how much I laughed during this movie.  South Park is funny from time to time but I just haven't been interested in that kind of thing in years.  That's why I was so surprised at how enjoyable this movie was.  As in South Park, Matt and Trey do not leave anyone out.  They make fun of everyone and every point of view.  If you like south park and toilet humor, but you didn't like this movie, then you must not have realized it is a satire.  I don't understand some of the reviews I've read here.  It sounds like people were offended!  How could you watch this movie without knowing that Trey and Matt would make fun YOU!  This movie mocks so many things that can't be listed, but here's tiny snippet:  Conservatives, liberals, actors, polititians, Koreans, Muslims, Puerto Ricans, the French, Terrorists, Blond blue-eyed American Jocks, the musical Rent, theatre, action flicks, any movie with a love scene, any movie where people fall in love, Ben afleck(sp?), all the gov't money wasted on fancy jets and equipment, country music, \\"peace-loving\\" actors(who turn to murdering mad men in the movie) who are willing to jump on whatever bandwagon is most popular at the time, world leaders, the UN, extremist Michael Moore, and \\"Arec Barrwin\\" (as Kim Jong would say) just to name a few.  If you were offended by this MOST HILARIOUS MOVIE, then you didn't know what you were getting in to.  BUY IT!  LAUGH your wooden puppet tushy off.  (I will say, that I refuse to let my parents watch this film for they would FREAK during the love scene.  Pure Pornography!)
B00006L83N|5.0|I like power metal bands...though I haven't really found one that I absolutely loved. Well, that is up until I discovered Symphony X. This CD explores the heavier and more aggressive side of this band and it shows. The guitar (Yes...only one guitar) continuosly shreds and the keyboards always pick up in full force when the guitar leaves off. The drums also are relentless and never fail to bring great beats to keep up with the rest of the music. It all sounds simply amazing because there is an undeniable chemistry between these musicians which makes the music constantly fluid. So, now you're probably wondering how good the vocals are...right? You shouldn't worry because Russel Allen has such a wide vocal range...he can handle all the melodies you can muster. The band makes sure that you don't get bored on this CD. There will be songs that you'll be head banging to and others that you can just mellow out to. Oh, yeah and as for the title track...I usually get bored with most metal \\"epics\\" because most bands usually don't have the talent  to create long extremely structured songs. While most bands fail at creating anything close to epic...Symphony X has got you covered. I was actually in awe by the end of the track when I first heard it. I'm serious...I'm not really a big fan of power metal but Symphony X is just so good that I purchased their CD after only listening to a few tracks.
0316666343|5.0|This book is bone-chilling and amazing. I loved every minute of it and was sad when I turned the last page to see nothing but the back of the book. I would recommend this book for anybody over the age of 14. Definately an adult book but mature teens can read it as well. You need to read this book if you love suspense, character growth, and mystery.

I love this book so much, it is an easy read, but it is so insightful to the lives of the \\"Oakies\\" and their perserverence through the depression. If you don't know the worst you can't appreciate the best. This is a survival story that is a clasic and should be read by every one! It is so awesome!!!!!
B00003CX8V|5.0|Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine collaborate beautifully together in Billy Wilders wonderfully written and directed The Apartment. Lemmon, in a role that laid the groundwork for his future portrayal of Felix Unger in The Odd Couple, plays C.C. Baxter an accountant and tiny cog in the huge corporate wheels of a mammoth insurance company.  Lemmon discovers that his key to advancement within the corporate hierarchy involves his lending out his apartment for illicit trysts by philandering corporate executives.<br /><br />Insensitve Director of personnel Mr Sheldrake played by Fred MacMurray gets wind of Lemmons arrangment and takes him to task.  He is actually angling toward borrowing the apartment for a rendez-vous with attractive elevator operator Fran Kubelik played by MacLaine, with whom he has been having an affair.  Things get dicey because Lemmon has developed a crush on MacLaine and is devastated when he learns the truth.<br /><br />In an aborted meeting at Lemmons apartment, MacLaine depressed over MacMurrays reluctance to divorce his wife, swallows a bottle full of sleeping pills.  Lemmon discovers her and with the aid of his neighbor Dr. Dreyfuss played nicely by Jack Kruschen nurse her back to health.  Lemmon again playing the lonely sensitive do gooder, a role he handles so well, eventually wins the heart of MacLaine.<br /><br />The acting performances shine under Wilders direction who also manages to convey the enormity of the insurance corporation in his well conceived sets.  Roles played by Ray Walston and David Lewis as lecherous corporate execs were very well executed
0895260131|5.0|In Islam, pigs are not Halal. For that reason, some might assume that the little pig on the cover of Robert Spencer's bestselling new Guide is meant to insult the faith.<br /><br />They would be wrong. Regnery has trademarked the term Politically Incorrect Guide, along with the little pig, and has posted this insignia on two other books, Politically Incorrect Guide to American History and Politically Incorrect Guide to Science, the latter due this fall.<br /><br />The series does intend to be humorous, however. Also on the cover is quotation from an Islamic chat room. A poster wrote of Spencer: \\"May Allah rip out his spine from his back and split his brains in two, and then put them both back, and then do it over and over again. Amen.\\" Not funny, but he jovially tags this \\"--'praise' for the author on RevivingIslam.com.\\"<br />These lighthearted touches, before one even opens a book on a deadly serious subject, foreshadow many more quips inside. A few examples:<br /><br />* After Muhayissa murdered K'ab, he was rebuked for the deed by his brother Huwayissa, who was not yet a Muslim. Muhayissa, unrepentant, told his brother, \\"Had  the one who ordered me to kill him ordered me to kill you I would have cut off your head.\\" Huwayissa replied, \\"By God, a religion which can bring you to this is marvelous!\\" And he became Muslim. \\"The world is still witnessing such miracles today.\\"<br /><br />* \\"Polygamy...is moving westward with Islam. In late 2004, polygamy had become so common among Muslims in Britain that the British were considering recognizing it for tax purposes.\\"<br /><br />* \\"Lying: It's wrong-except when it isn't.\\"<br /><br />Other funny tidbits are the small boxes in each chapter entitled \\"A book you're not supposed to read.\\" These recommendations include such scholarly works by Joseph Schacht; Bat Ye'or; and Raphael Israeli; as well as ancient and modern Islamic texts like the Qur'an, Umdat al-Salik, or Reliance of the Traveller: A Classic Manual of Islamic Sacred Law, translated by Noah Ha Min Keller and Milestones by Sayyid Qutb.<br /><br />But despite the humor, the 231-page text is a somber discussion of Islam for laymen, and the scholarship at its base is impressive. The book includes 21 pages of footnotes, the vast majority of which cite Muslim sources.<br /><br />Spencer attacks the notion, head on, that the Qur'an teaches tolerance and peace, for example, by citing the Qur'an itself.<br /><br />\\"Say: O disbelievers! I worship not that which ye worship; nor worship ye that which I worship. And I shall not worship that which ye worship. Nor will ye worship that which I worship. Unto you your religion and unto me my religion\\"(Qur'an 109:1-6).<br /><br />This would be well and good, Spencer adds, if the Qur'an stopped there. But it doesn't. While Muslims are instructed that there is no compulsion in religion --- and to \\"begin not hostilities. Lo! Allah loveth not aggressors\\" --- once hostilities have begun,<br /><br />\\"Muslims should wage them furiously: 'And slay them wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution is worse than slaughter'.\\"<br /><br />It is not a fair assumption, either, that Spencer takes anything out of context. Very often, he adds context to quotations often seen in the public media.<br /><br />Take the often-quoted Qur'an 5:32: \\"Whosoever killeth a human being for other than manslaughter or corruption in the earth, it shall be as if he had killed all mankind, and those who saveth the life of one, it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind.\\" This, writes Spencer, is not what it might seem. It is addressed to the \\"Children of Israel,\\" for starters, not to Muslims, and it is in the past tense. It is actually a warning to Jews not to make war against Mohammed. (Qur'an 5:31-33)<br /><br />The three-part book is divided into eighteen chapters, part one dealing with Islam and its early spread by the sword, part two covering the Crusades and the various current myths surrounding this history, and part three reporting on the current global jihad war. It is not intended to be a general introduction to the Islamic religion or a comprehensive survey of the Crusades, according to Spencer, but \\"an examination of certain highly tendentious assertions about both Islam and the Crusades that have entered the popular discourse.\\"<br /><br />Concerning the Crusades in particular, the book comes to some remarkable conclusions. The Crusades were not called, according to Spencer, to rape pillage and burn, but on the contrary to defend the Christian world. \\"The conquest of Jerusalem in 638,\\" he writes, \\"stood at the beginning of centuries of Muslim aggression, and Christians in the Holy Land faced an escalating spiral of persecution.\\"<br /><br />Early in the 8th century, 60 Christian pilgrims from Amorium were crucified; in the same era Caesarea's Muslim governor seized some Iconium pilgrims and executed them all as spies-excepting the small handful that converted to Islam. Christians were forbidden to teach religion to others-including their own children. In the 9th century Christians fled Holy Land persecutions in large numbers. Churches were destroyed, monks slaughtered and so on. The year 1004 began a decade long persecution in which 30,000 churches were destroyed and Jews were similarly accosted. Thus in 1095 Pope Urban II called the First Crusade to regain previously Christian lands.<br /><br />Furthermore, Spencer contends that the Crusades were actually successful. The Crusades \\"bought Europe time-time that might have meant the difference between her demise and dhimmitude and her rise and return to glory.\\"<br /><br />As for today, Spencer warns that the jihad of the seventh century is still alive and well. One proof is the similarity of the quotations of an 11th century jihadist compared with that of our contemporaries. Another is in the longing for a revival of the caliphate---in America. Another is the inability to criticize Islam without being attacked.<br /><br />This book relies heavily on Muslim scholars. Everyone should read it.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

B00009P1O0|5.0|I recently got this album and listened to it twice back to back already. I already consider it some of his best work. On the Beach is a great album. every song is great and kept my attention throughout like most Young albums always do. I didn't know of this album when I first got into Neil, I started off getting his ultra classic albums like Harvest, After the Goldrush, Zuma, Everyone Knows This Is Nowhere etc... Then one day I was looking online for more Young and for a while I didn't even consider getting this one at first, because I heard he had some decent albums that I probably wouldn't even give a chance to, but I gave it a shot, listened to On the Beach on this very website and poof! I had to get it. Then I listened to it back to back for the first time and it rocked! This album makes me respect and enjoy Neil Young even more. He is pretty much tied with Bowie being my favorite two singer/song writers. Get On the Beach and blast your speakers out! Neil Young is the man!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I don't understand why other reviewers give this film few stars. Does a movie have to be spelled out for everyone? Does the plot have to hit people on the head like a 'delicious bass' before they can understand the story? <br /> <br />This is a layered, nonjudgmental and sweet story that isn't suitable for those who don't understand the nuances of life. \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is an aknowledgement of friendship and the sacrifices one makes for it, of acceptance, as well as a statement that appearances aren't everything.  <br /> <br />In the DVD features, the director/ writer explains and shows his senior film project, which was a shorter version of this movie. He says in the voice-over that Napoleon is supposed to embody true friendship (in the film-school film, Napoleon gives up buying a fanny pack, which he really wants, to buy a wig for a Pedro-like character).  <br /> <br />I've noticed from my own acquaintances that the people who don't like this movie tend to like movies that are more transparent. But this movie makes you think about it long after it's over - and there are no better stories than those that stay with you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0312995423|1.0|With apologies to Douglas Adams, this is obviously some strange new usage of the word \\"thriller\\" that I was not previously aware of.<br /><br />This book is the literary equivalent of a terrible Hollywood action movie. A thin, predictable plot and remarkably lazy research. If you learn anything about cryptography from this book, you've probably learned it wrong. This guy can't even keep bits and bytes straight!<br /><br />For a much more exciting (if a little more challenging), read Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson. Bruce Schneier, the rock star of cypherpunks, provided a new strong encryption algorithm, that requires only a deck of cards, just for this story (detailed in the appendix).<br /><br />If you are looking for something a bit more approachable, try Mark Fabi's Wyrm (at the very least, it has crossword puzzles in it).<br /><br />If you like a challenging read--something entertaining that stretches your mind--check out Greg Egan's Terenesia or Permutation City.<br /><br />Life's too short to support bad entertainment when there is so much good stuff out there.
068987474X|1.0|PUH-LEASE!! As a 30 year old, red-blooded, straight, American male, I can honestly say that this book is quite an ostentatious LOAD OF BALONEY! These people do not speak for me or many of the other guys that I know -- Not Even Close!!.     Ladies, PLEASE do not believe the garbage that you read in this book, for while SOME men find its passages agreeable and insightful, just as many DO NOT. I cannot stress this enough: Please Don't Buy Into This Stuff. The book has fragments of truth dispersed among clouds of testosterone-fueled belligerent disinformation. Believe it or not, not ALL men fall into the narrow-minded categorizations that the authors of this \\"work\\" would lead you to believe are absolute. Some of us DO have some depth of character. Please ladies, don't judge us all according to stereotype; we don't like it (nor do we fit into them) any more than you do.     But then, what am I saying, most women are fully capable spotting a lame line in whatever format it might appear!    However, if you're looking for a good chuckle, and a stark constrast between the thought processes of women and men, this one's for you. While it should not be taken seriously, it is, I must admit, entertaining.    Take this book for all that it truly is-- A Joke.      Respectfully yours,  C. Garrett  Little Rock, AR    P.S.: Just a suggestion- find a free or used copy; don't pay full price! You'll wish you hadn't!  ;-)
B00005JNTX|4.0|This is basically film noir exaggerated beyond reason - a film that is black and white in it's characters as much as it is literally black and white. I call it fantasy because it is unapologetically unrealistic - it does not pretend to represent reality in any way, shape or form, and in doing so, it is free to create a world of its own, true to its own consistent logic which has nothing to do with the logic of the real world. The movie is not deep in the least, is very violent, and is HORRIBLY misogynistic - the most misogynistic movie I have ever seen, but it is also unlike anything else I have seen - a dream perhaps, a film noir stripped to it's bare bones and then exaggerated a thousand-fold, Mickey Spillane on steroids. Recomended for guys, expecially movie \\"geeks\\".
0060254920|5.0|Hey, don't waste time reading this pedantic review, because you can finish WTWTA cover-to-cover in about as long. Go! Really! Get this book! Run!<br /><br />Well, if you're still here, let me try a second time to convince you. WTWTA (as we in the cool crowd call it...) is the wonderful tale of a little boy named Max, who dresses in his wolf suit and proceeds to run amok through his house, chasing his dog with a fork and making so much noise and mischief that he gets sent to his room. Ah, but rather than ending there, the story takes off. (Bet you never saw that coming, didya?) Max either imagines what comes next or--as I prefer to see it--is transported into another dimension, where Wild Things, some of the hippest, wildest-looking creatures this side of Budhuhastania live. To get there, Max sails in and out of a year and lands where the wild things are. Initially the Wild Things size Max up as a pre-dinner snack, but Max isn't scared of them. Nope, he tames them with a look and bids them to \\"BE STILL\\". And they do. The Wild Things recognize in Max a kindred spirit and make him their ruler. They begin a wild rumpus and dance and howl and party all night. It's a great sort of life.<br /><br />And I bloody wish the book had ended here, but...<br /><br />Well eventually Max becomes tired of his job as king and plots a return home. The Wild Things, being less than overjoyed to hear the news of their king's abdication, plead with him not to go and promise, \\"We'll eat you up, we love you so!\\"<br /><br />Oooohh, heavy stuff indeed. Do the Wild Things feast upon fillet of Max? Sorry to leave you on the edge of your seat, but you'll have to travel through all dozen pages of Where The Wild Things Are to find out for yourself.<br /><br />Unhesitantly recommended by me, Mr. Sendak's lifelong fan.

B00005JN5X|4.0|This is a Terry Gilliam film, so if you have seen Brazil or 12 Monkeys you know this guy doesn't make films for the popular masses. Out of the all the movies of his I have seen, The Brothers Grimm is the closest thing to a hollywood film Gilliam has made in my opinion. I heard a lot of scenes were cut out due to the studio pressure, so there will likely be a Director's Cut which should help the film flow together a little better. The acting is very good from Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as the brothers, but once again Peter Stormare steals the show with his zany officer of torture. The film is visually a beautiful sight, filled with lush landscapes and an enchanted forrest. I liked how many Grimm fairytales were woven into this magical world (Little Red Riding Hood, Hansel and Gretel, etc.) and the CGI wasn't overdone. Overall, The Brothers Grimm is a worthy film in Terry Gilliam's uniquely brilliant library.
B00082ZS5W|5.0|A smooth and polished performance with perfect lighting effects, absolutely astounding sound and an almost ethereal quality about it, Dido's performance at Brixton Academy is pure magic.  I'll admit that I was skeptical before I actually viewed this concert.  In the past, the only live performances by Dido that I had seen were appearances on talk shows and such, which did not showcase her talent like they should have.  In fact, she often seemed timid and shy.  Despite that, I have always been a devoted fan, even before the days of \\"Stan\\" and the series Roswell.  Dido is and always has been captivating and real: her music is extremely accessible and emotionally touching. <br /> <br />When the first harsh beats of \\"Stoned\\" hit my ears, I just knew the whole concert was going to be fantastic.  There was an intense energy in the air at the Academy the night, and you can feel it while watching the video.  The music pulses right through you.  I was ecstatic Dido chose to open her concert with \\"Stoned\\": what a great piece!  It has always been one of my favorites from her second album, and it perfectly sets the mood for the entire concert within the first 30 seconds. <br /> <br />Many of the songs Dido performs remain similar to the respected album versions (\\"Don't Leave Home\\", \\"Sand In My Shoes\\") but they don't lack for intensity and enthusiasm.  Each song has its own little new additions, however subtle they may be.  But Dido's revamped versions of favorites like \\"See You When You're 40\\", \\"Honestly Ok\\" and \\"Do You Have A Little Time\\" are what truly impress.  The live versions are better in some ways than the original cuts.  Particularly impressive is Dido's edgier version of \\"Isobel\\": her vocals sound fantastic!  Also to be commended is her reinterpretation of \\"Hunter\\", which sounds very jazzy and fun. <br /> <br />The instrumental balance throughout the concert is very well done and executed wonderfully.  Everyone seems to be on the same wavelength.  Several of the musicians shine as soloists, and the drummer in particular is very impressive.  In between tracks, Dido briefly describes the origin of many of her songs, being both blunt and charming at the same time (a quality that seduces many men and intrigues most women).  Also appealing about Dido in this performance is her appearance: she looks as if she's ready for a night of clubbing.  She appears both gorgeous and playful.  There isn't the slightest hint of arrogance in her, and she seems incredibly friendly.   <br /> <br />If you thought Dido was quiet, you're wrong: this video proves that, not only does Dido have an edge, but she has a wonderful sense of humor as well.  The audio disc included in this package is a real perk, as it possesses the same intensity the video does, even without the visual stimulation.  However, five of the live tracks are not included on the audio disc, which is a bit of a letdown.  But the audio disc flows smoothly from one song to the next, and it feels complete despite the missing songs. <br /> <br />If you're a diehard Dido fan, you absolutely have to have this video!  If you are a casual fan, or if you haven't yet discovered the hidden pleasures of Dido's musical creations, then I highly recommend you check this out: you may find yourself transformed into a devoted listener.

B00003CX8U|2.0|First of all, let me preface this by saying that I love Bob Fosse and musical theatre, so I wanted with every fiber of my being to love this film and I didnt. I'm sure it was a phenomenon in the 70s but I dont think it holds up. I think a few of the dance scenes are sensational, but they are bolstered by a weak montage of a story with flat performances by Anne Reinking, Jessica Lange, and Roy Scheider. I believe this was in the era before Jessica could act. Both her and Reinking prove Fosse loved beautiful women as set pieces as both women act like they are reading from the script cold.  <br /> <br />The standout in the film is the woman who plays Roy's ex-wife. She is the standout emotionally and physically with an impressive dance/conversation number with Roy. When she was on screen, I felt the emotion. An amazing portrayal. <br /> <br />The film lacks any emotional depth and I felt nothing for Joe Gideon or his motivations. All in all, a great risk of a film with very little payoff. The closing number was mind-numbing to be quite honest. Over the top and exhausting whereas the opening number was stark, raw and fantastic. I was happy to see the film end and that saddens me. However, it's worth a look but probably not a keeper.

There were two decent songs here, Fading Lights and Driving the Last Spike, not the greatest thing they've ever recorded, but still not bad. <br /> <br />But overall, this album's pretty boring.  Makes very nice background music, I'll give it that.  But there really is nothing of note hear.  There is an over-abundance of sappy love songs and various elevator music filler.  It's hard to believe, from listening to this album, that Genesis was once an edgy prog rock band.
0446613444|3.0|Let me preface this review by saying that I'm a big Connelly fan. I've read virtually all of his books but never got around to reading his sophomore effort \\"The Black Ice\\" until now. And I have to say that I was a bit disappointed.  <br /> <br />In his Edgar Award winning first novel, \\"The Black Echo\\", Connelly delved deep into the demons of main character Harry Bosch's past and relates it to the case before him. In \\"The Black Ice\\", Connelly focuses less on the development and insight into Bosch's character and more on Bosch's hard-nosed determination to find the link between two cases, one involving the murder of a \\"Juan\\" Doe and the other involving the apparent suicide of a cop in the narcotics unit.  <br /> <br />First the positives: There are flashes of vintage Connelly in this book, such as attention to detail when involving the reader in the different locales Bosch visits in pursuit of his investigation. And without revealing too much, the investigation takes us to both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border, and Bosch's struggle to keep the case moving forward while still trying to maintain the appearance of compliance with Mexican law enforcement officials is particularly interesting. <br /> <br />Now the reason for 3 stars: To be honest, it's a bit slow. Connelly focuses too many pages of the book on the investigation of the narcotics cop's suicide, then once the results of that is revealed, the book then goes into a whirlwind of activity that makes the story seem disjointed, as if one author wrote the first half and another author wrote the second half.  <br /> <br />You also sympathize less with Bosch's character in this book. Again, without revealing too much, Bosch \\"intimate\\" encounters in this book make you almost hate him. Then Bosch will later reflect upon the muck of being a cop and the lack of morality he sees in the city, and how he tries to rise above that. I understand that Bosch is imperfect and scarred, but the aforementioned activities Bosch indulges in make him look like a (for lack of a better term) complete jerk. <br /> <br />The ending is also a bit cliched, and it seems Connelly really tried to pattern the cookie cutter outline of this book to some of Raymond Chandler's works, namely the Long Goodbye. Unfortunately, I think The Black Ice falls short.  <br /> <br />For Connelly fans, let me give you an idea of how I rank this book to his other works: I would give The Black Echo and Bloodwork 5 stars, Trunk Music (which got lukewarm reception from reviewers but which I enjoyed) I would give 4 stars, and The Poet, which I thought was Connelly's most disappointing and weakest work, I would give 2 stars. The Black Ice gets 3 stars from me... it's not a horrible read, but if you happened to have skipped this book during your journey through the Harry Bosch series, it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world to not go back.
B00006WKY9|5.0|.. in my opion atleast. Think about this for a moment, \\"Taken By Force\\" is sandwiched between two landmark albums which makes it hard for it to get any credability. \\"Virgin Killer\\" is considered by many fans the definative 70's Scorps album while \\"LoveDrive\\" is  very important historically  in the Scorps career in which they embarked on the MTV route. <br /> <br />I will admit this upfront, even though i am a fan, i never liked any of their 80's MTV material too much. It was not that i thought it was bad, it's not, the 80's stuff is quite good actually, but it really never appealed to me the way the 70's material did because it was just too generic and commerical sounding for my taste; simplified riffs and generic stupid lyrics about loving/missing/wanting to be with your \\"woman\\" and \\"rocking out\\", almost every other song they wrote was about that. The lesson is that greed is a destructive force, it has the ability to completey ruin great bands (look at Metallica), for the Scorpions it meant abandoning creativity and artistic integrity for the almighty dollar, the damage has been done and can not be repaired, now you can hear \\"Rock You Like A Hurricane\\" at almost every sporting event around the country. <br /> <br />This album was actauly the swan song for the meaningful and artistic Scorpions, it was the last album with Uli Jon Roth, who i feel was the creative nucleus of the Scorps of the old days. The songs are all pretty diverse; basic hard rock, metal, pyschadelic and beautiful ballads all inhabit this dark, moody work of art. It might throw some for a loop if they are only used to the 80's Scorpions.

0895260131|1.0|This book is the product of sleazy right-wing publishing house Regnery.  Regnery has also published such landmark works as \\"In Defense of Internment\\" which defends the world war 2 roundup of japanese citizens.  Thats worth noting because the people behind this work of religious bigotry and hate would probably like nothing better than to round up american muslims.<br /><br />The book also comes to the defense of the crusades as a just and valid conflict.  Most astonishingly, despite the massacres of jews the accompanied the crusades, there are jews who have come to see their good side now as well.  They, as the book, seem to have forgotten that the crusades started with pogroms all over europe and that the first crusade ended with the massacre of jews of Jerusalem.<br /><br />Further, the idiot who wrote this book seems to forget other aspects of crusades.  Lets remember the fourth crusade for a moment.  In that Crusade, the Holy Cristian Warriors defending against Islam looted and destroyed the capital of the Byzantine Empire.  They desecrated its christian churchs and then divided those christian lands among the crusaders.  The Eastern Orthodox Christians were not considered Christian or even human.  They were reduced to a form of slavery under the crusaders.  The Eastern Ortodox were never helped by the crusades and by the end wanted the crusaders gone in favor of the muslims in many cases.<br /><br />Also to be remembered is the crusade launched against the Christians of Southern France, the terrible sufferings of Jews and others under the Inquisition in particular in spain.  and the sufferings of many others.<br /><br />Those who read this book should carefully think about the day when they become the target of the book.  Many of the Christians who support books like this don't have any more respect for their (in theory) fellow christians than they have for Islam.  And Jews who applaud whipping up this sort of hate thinking it will help the jewish people or Israel have not learned the lessons of the crusades.  Once bigotry and extremism is unleashed, its impossible to control.  Its victims tend to be all minorities rather than one in particular.people or Israel have not learned the lessons of the crusades.

0800141660|4.0|Emma Thompson has given us a wonderful adaptation of Jane Austen's novel, even managing to include the youngest daughter, Margaret, who didn't make it into the much longer BBC version. The casting is excellent, the only quibble being that it requires some effort to believe Emma Thompson as a nineteen year old. They are all delightful actors, though, and I particularly enjoyed the romance between Kate Winslet and Alan Rickman. The sensible daughter gets the penniless clergyman and the impressionable daughter gets the weathy older man.
B0002OERI0|5.0|<br />Green Day has created a work that is overwrought, lyrically melodramatic, and brilliant. Reviving the \\"rock opera\\" concept, the band looks at America through eyes clouded with rage. Starting with the hard driving title track, a song that questions his place in America as it currently exists, the narrator begins a journey from his disaffected home to the world at large; a place he discovers is just as difficult to survive in. Through trials and tribulations, he finds love and loss, momentary peace of mind and blinding anger. The music ranges from pop to punk without pause or even noticeable hesitation. This is a work of assured authority. Like any \\"rock opera\\", the \\"book\\" is often confusing and open to a variety of interpretations, but for me the bottom line was this band has taken on a most difficult of task, trying to put into words their dismay at the way the world is going. And they have succeeded admirably.  <br />
B0009Q0F5U|4.0|I am a huge fan of the New BG. While watching Season One's episodes, I kept saying to myself: \\"I wish I had this music.\\" Well, now I do. And, it is amazing!!! The composer has taken many differnt types of music from all around the world and blended them together into someting epic. He mixes Tribal, Celtic, Arabic, Electronic, Opera, and Romantic Classical music, and Muzac, into a sound that is compleatly unique, spectacular, emotional, touching, violent, and just about every other description that you can think of. The drums get a little tedious, but in all, this is definitly a \\"must hear\\".  <br /> <br />Of all the tracks, my favorite must be the Celtic \\"Wonder My Friends\\" It's both beautiful and heartbreaking. I feel moved every time I hear it.  <br />
B000065VB0|5.0|<br />It starts with the chilling drumbeat and the \\"Intruder\\" creeps into your consciousness as skillfully as the best thriller you've ever read or seen. The tension continues as you hear the story of a man who has \\"No Self Control,\\" the panic resonating in his voice; this panic is carried over to the amnesiac of \\"I Don't Remember.\\"  Then things slow down...to the most unsettling story of all. The insight Gabriel shows into the mind of an assassin at work; the type of person who sees killing as a way to celebrity, is incredible. <br /> \\"I don't really hate you <br /> -I don't care what you do <br /> We were made fro each other <br /> Me and you <br /> I want to be somebody <br /> -you were like that too <br /> If you don't get given you learn to take <br /> And I will take you\\" <br />The whole CD continues this series of out of kilter themes, from children's war games (\\"Games Without Frontiers\\") to the rationale behind prejudice (\\"How can we be in if there is no outside\\") found in \\"Not One of Us,\\" and the mostly instrumental look at trying to \\"Lead a Normal Life.\\"  <br />Finishing with epic tale of Stephen Biko, a song that stands with the great anthems produced in the rock era, Gabriel has created his breakthrough recording. This is where all his divergent interests come together to create an incredible combination of rhythm, lyrical brilliance, and social relevance.  <br />
076790592X|1.0|\\"An old man, a young man, and life's greatest lesson\\" pffftt!    In short: this is a book written by a sports writer, not a journalist, about the philosophical insights of a college Professor whose subject was Sociology, not Philosophy.    \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" - whilst being well-intentioned - lacks emotional depth, profundity, wit and analysis. Morrie's aphorisms are particularly annoying in their banality: 'love each other or perish' - yeah, whatever you say, old, dead dude.    Morrie seems to have been a popular, compassionate fellow but he most emphatically was not a philosopher and he had nothing new or valuable to say on the subject of philosophy or death.     My sympathy for him is somewhat muted by the fact that he - an educated man - had the conceit to believe that he had something to teach outside his chosen field and felt he he had some 'wisdom' to pass on. The cold, hard facts of the matter are that Morrie wasn't much of a thinker and Mitch isn't much of a writer.
B000001E7V|5.0|The whole formula is there on their first record.  His subsequent recordings have emphasized different aspects to the style Tricky invented on Maxinquaye, and they're worth getting to know.   <br /> <br />Black Steel is a great song wrecked by stupid lyrics (Chuck D probably thinks so by now too, eh?).  My least favorite track.  But not unlistenable, and the rest of this is so listenable it doesn't wear out with repeated play. <br /> <br />Each song is sort of like a funhouse ride.  You get on, the ride starts, it ends when it ends.   <br /> <br />It's quite a ride.

0393320928|4.0|This book, a sequel - of sorts - to `Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!',  continues the autobiographical journey of physicist Richard Feynman (d.1988), and expands on the some of the topics glossed over in the first book.  For example, in his first autobiography, Feynman mentions his first wife, Arlene, and her death at a young age from tuberculosis; here, the story is expanded, \\"assembled over the past ten years out of pieces from six different stories\\", and although this episode was painful for the author, he ended up satisfied with the finished product, and Feynman was \\"happy to share it with others\\" (8).  Other events covered in this book include Feynman's journeys to Switzerland and Japan, and the second part deals with his role in the space shuttle Challenger investigation, which occurred close to his death from cancer in 1988.  The Challenger chapters are extremely interesting, and you believe his observations on how NASA and the government work in regards to tragedies that seem to threaten the status quo.  In the last part of the book is Feynman's `Appendix F', his contribution to the Challenger investigation, almost left out of the report completely (was it by accident?  Probably not).  The final essay is `The Value of Science', an address originally delivered in 1955, where the author covers the role of science in a post-WWII nuclear capable world.  This address resonates today as it did 50 years ago - my favorite paragraph deals with the founding fathers and Feynman's take on the creation of our government: \\"Even then it was clear to socially minded people that the openness of possibilities was an opportunity, and that doubt and discussion were essential to progress into the unknown.\\" (247)  Although not as entertaining as his first book, `What Do YOU Care What People Think?' is a wonderful companion piece to explore who Feynman was and what made him tick.
B0000074GK|4.0|I picked up this CD a few days ago and while I find it very enjoyable I can't give it five stars like everybody else.  Some of the songs go on a little longer than they need to, almost everyone one on the disk is over 5 minutes!  At times they also remind me of Whitesnake, among others, which is not a horrible thing but not a great thing either.  Overall, this CD is a worthwhile purchase if you've never heard of Thunder and are looking for something new after completing your Zeppelin, Who, Purple, Sabbath, etc. collections. I'd agree that's it's better than just about anything coming out today (not too hard to do that) but it's still a couple of notches below the best that British rock has to offer.
0393316041|5.0|The subtitle of this work is `Adventures of a Curious Character' - an apt description of Richard Feynman, physicist and Nobel Prize winner.  Although the narrative is not purely chronological, and certain areas of his life are glossed over (his marriages and family life), this is an entertaining and informative glimpse of how Feynman lived his life and more importantly, his thought process.  By his own admission, he thinks in a different way about math and physics, and his `hands-on' practical approach to science is not appreciated by everyone he encounters.  A good example of this is the section on Brazil: although his students there can regurgitate scientific information, they have no clue on its application, or HOW a theory works.  As a teacher myself, I see this every day - students who can memorize, but not analyze.  Other sections of the book deal with his participation on the Manhattan Project, which illustrates the frenzy the US government went through to develop the atomic bomb; Feynman's running theme here is how `fast' everyone worked, despite limited and unfinished laboratories and resources.  Other topics include his safecracking at Los Alamos; his artistic endeavors (the sequel to this book, `What Do YOU Care What Other People Think?' actually includes some of his artwork, which is outstanding); and his varied musical experiences.  To try to encapsulate all the areas covered in this book would be impossible; at times, it's almost a stream of consciousness monologue.  That, however, is what makes the book so entertaining and definitely worth reading.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Every now and then a show comes along that enthralls viewers in such a way that it creates a cultish phenomenon (Similar to Farscape). Joss Wheedon is a master at creating such works (Buffy, Angel). I watched all of the episodes within about 2 days (Stayed up to 3 AM the last day). Every single episode is truly unique, fun, and humorous. The characters are completely individual with their own motivations, and one of them turns on the crew occasionally. Some of the villians are shown just the right amount of times to create the \\"book-like\\" effect of letting your mind create the horrifying image of them instead of the show feeding it to you (I'm thinking about the reevers). Joss is also a master at prolonged suspense, and every episode will have you on the edge of your seat at one point...or for the entire thing. One thing is for certain: When you buy this set you will hate FOX forever for making a blatantly moronic decision in promoting the show wrong, airing episodes out of order, and cutting the show because they didn't put it in appropriate time slots. You will love this show so much that after the last episode you might nearly break down because you know there isn't any more to watch. But.. on September 30th, the Serenity movie will be in theatres. You will love owning this set and DONT STOP THE SIGNAL!
B00005JNEI|1.0|If you have bought Fahrenheit 9/11 on DVD, then I strongly suggest you get a refund and get something a little more truthful.  As he did in a similar scenario in F 9/11's predecessor, Bowling for Columbine, Michael Moore attempts to pin the blame for the terrorist attacks on the WTC and Pentagon on everybody from President Bush to VP Dick Cheney and Halliburton through slickly edited interviews with people who lost loved loved ones in the 9/11 attacks and the war on terror in Iraq, as well as folks who just plain don't like Bush.<br /><br />Like a poor marksman, however, Moore keeps missing the real target he should be blaming: al Qaeda and other terrorist groups, as well as those in our own government who did not pass along the information alerting the President to this situation.  THEY are the ones that should be blamed for 9/11, and yet Moore points the finger at the Bush administration, judging them for all the evil in the world.<br /><br />Nice try, Moore, but I'm not buying.

Experienced coders (especially those have recently picked up C#) will recognize many of these patterns (although maybe not by name).

0895260131|1.0|Robert Spencer never considered himself as an expert about Islam prior to 9/11...hmm,things changed.. ain't that right, Robby?

B000AYEL1A|5.0|Excellent movie, excellent soundtrack, and excellent performances. One of Bab's best. The DVD extras are o.k--the best being the deleted scene of BABS playing guitar and humming the melody to \\"Evergreen.\\" That scene should never had been cut. It is magic. Also, it would have been nice to include her performing \\"Evergreen\\" at the Academy Awards and show Paul Williams and her winning the Oscar.     The musical moments are still mesmerizing--almost like they were on the big screen 30 years ago. I must admit 30 years ago when I first saw the film, I thought Kris Kristofferson was badly miscast. But upon viewing the DVD, I now find his performance was right on target--I mean the part WAS of a fading rock star--course singing and all.     All in all, one of BABS best with her musical instincts perfection. A totally DON\\"T MISS film experience.

This is an inavative cd that has some great stuff on it, but i just find it a bit strange.
B000929AJQ|1.0|After the overly pretentious and self-indulgent mess known by mankind as The Fragile, Trent Reznor went into reclusion for a whopping six years. Upon listening to Trent's first record in six years one cannot help but to wonder where the time was spent. Is it possible that Trent spent the entire duration of those six long years in his studio writing this fine material? After all, a lot of things can happen in the span of a half a decade. NIN itself is an entity that has survived the life and death of many phases and trends in popular music. The band stands alone as being something unique and distinguished, which is why it has survived for so long. And even though Trent brought industrial music to the mainstream for mass consumption, he moved NIN far away from those roots long ago. NIN used to be a clever pop-band with great hooks and catchy angst filled lyrics. In recent years, Trent has pursued a larger than life sound. The simple fact is that NIN is a pop-band. I expect them to make pop music, not failed art rock opuses. In reality, With Teeth falls in-between these two categories. It falls short of being a truly great pop record and it does not take NIN's sound a step further, like each album did before it.     When The Downward Spiral came out Alternative Rock was at its peak and when The Fragile came out NU-metal was just starting to get big. Of course, NIN was at their height both artistically and commercially in the 1990's. Now, NIN is a former ghost of itself. NIN seems to be drained of all artistic passion. The feelings that Trent's music used to conjure up has turned into pitiful self-parody and mundane banality. Perhaps, this is nothing more than a quick and shameless cash in on a devote fanbase.        You know, it is not that I expect another Downward Spiral, or a Broken from Trent. But, this album plays out and feels like a rehash. There is simply nothing interesting going on in this album lyrically or musically. I was hoping that With Teeth was going to sound different from anything Trent did in the past, but it sounds like a combination of the influences from all of his albums. Trent needs a radical departure.     To put it into words that you may or may not understand, With Teeth plays out like a scaled down version of The Fragile. Everything that plagued that particular album is absent in With Teeth, but the album is a tedious mess in its own way. And even though this album is more song-orientated, the songs themselves are very poor. The songs have a very commercial feel to them, and unlike some of Trent's past music there is no real sense of progression within the songs. They are simply stagnant and boring. The best thing for Trent Reznor to do right now is to either give it up, or to find his artistic passion again. It has been well over ten years since he put out anything that was good. How anyone could even wait six years for such a lackluster effort is beyond my comprehension. Why do people still support this self-pitying hasbeen?     Maybe Trent will get it right in 2012, but I personally wouldn't count on it. In the mean time there is much better music out there to listen to, so I won't waste my time with this With the Teeth.

B000035P7X|5.0|When I heard that Bob Dylan had formally become a candidate for the Nobel Prize for Literature, my immediate thought was that it was about time.  Words set to music are still words.  Besides, when they start rhyming, or at least are in that ballpark, then you can talk about them as being poetry, and poets have won the Noble prize for Literature, so why not Bob Dylan?  Writing in support of the nomination Alan Ginsberg wrote: \\"Dylan is a major American Bard & minstrel of the XX Century, whose words have influenced many generations throughout the world. He deserves a Nobel Prize in recognition of his mighty and universal powers.\\"<br /><br />Fortunately the people who decide such things as Nobel prizes tend to restrict themselves to words on pages rather than cinema verit&eacute; documentaries, because what would they think of the 23-year-old Dylan who appears at the eye of \\"Bob Dylan: Don't Look Back.\\"  Made during Dylan's 1965 tour of England by D.A. Pennebaker, there is not enough music in it to warrant watching it for that alone.  There are bits from several songs, such as  \\"The Times They Are A-Changing'\\" and \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue,\\" but you can get a bit of a Dylan fix from the complete audio tracks for songs from the tour available as a special feature (Dylan's interaction with his audience seems civil and pleasant enough).  There are several shots of Dylan walking on stage and the audience erupting into applause, but Pennebaker is not interested in providing concert footage.  In contrast, for the most part Dylan is not all that interested in talking.  Sometimes you think that the only times he is happy is when he is playing his guitar or fooling around on the piano.<br /><br />What you think about this documentary comes down to what you think about Dylan, and that is going to depend on two key exchanges.  The first is a young man (if he had a name I missed it) who thinks that Dylan should get to know him.  Dylan asks \\"Why?\\"  I do not think the question is posed facetiously, but more as a challenge.  The young man is upset over this challenge to his self-esteem, but for the life of him he cannot answer the question.  Yes, he is being asked to justify his existence, but there is a level on which that is what the Sixties were all about.  The young man studied science in school.  Why?  To what end?  To accomplish what with his life?  Dylan's questions get more and more specific, but the young man's answers keep him hiding in the tall grass of generalities.  I did not think Dylan was being cruel because as I read the exchange he was giving this guy every opportunity to come up with an answer.  Maybe he would have cut the guy off at the knees at that point, but it is only when this guy makes it clear he wants the validation to come from Dylan that the singer-songwriter just grins and unloads a few parting shots.  At the end of this first exchange I was thinking everybody praises Dylan for what he says (or at least what he writes) but they just do not listen.<br /><br />The second exchange is when a reporter from \\"TIME\\" shows up to interview Dylan, who insists that magazines would never dare print the truth.  Of course the reporter asks the big question, which can be traced back at least to Pontius Pilate, and wants to know what is truth.  Clearly no student of the Sophists, Dylan comes up with an operational definition of truth as a photograph of a tramp vomiting into a sewer next to one of Rockefeller.  The juxtaposition of such images is certainly confrontational, but the truth that Dylan suggests apparently needs more explanation.  The reporter presses for clarification, which is just what Dylan is doing in the previous scene.  But rather than provide specifics, Dylan sticks with the images he has articulated.  Of course, this is not surprising, because such images and words are the cornerstone of his most powerful lyrics.  Asking him to explain what such things mean is tantamount to asking a magician to explain his tricks.  However, it also begs the question as to whether such meaning is ultimately to be found in the poet rather than in his poetry (I go with the latter because for me meaning is created by my experience decoding the text and ultimately what the creator did or did not intend does not matter, as Charles Manson would be more than happy to explain to you while listening to \\"The White Album\\" by the Beatles).<br /><br />Of course, all of this is taking place in the fishbowl that was Dylan's life at that time in front of that small circle of friends (for lack of a better word) who are in constant attendance.

The Beatles do not show up, but they are mentioned and it is painfully clear that they are on a different mountaintop from Dylan.

B0002NRRAG|3.0|I find this album occasionally enjoyable, particularly the Leonard Cohen song. Unfortunately, her singing voice is very similar to David Sedaris' Billie Holiday impersonation. In fact, the similarity to Holiday is very distracting and keeps the album from being very memorable.<br /><br />While I'm on it, I don't get this thing with trying to sound like Billie Holiday. Billie Holiday did a really fine job of it, but the rest (Peyroux, Norah Jones) apparently are unable to come up with their own vocal identity.
B00006BGXL|4.0|Distortion. Either you love it or you hate it, and that will determine whether you love or hate the Velvet Underground's \\"White Light/White Heat,\\" which was the final album with John Cale on it. It's strange, raw and eerie, and except for the too-long finale, a fairly good collection.<br /><br />It kicks off with distorted pop song \\"White Light/White Heat,\\" and gets followed by equally distorted series of offbeat songs, such as the sex-change operation ballad \\"Lady Godiva's Operation,\\" the relatively ethereal \\"Here She Comes Now,\\" and the twisted, squealing riffs of \\"I Heard Her Call My Name.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Gift\\" is perhaps the most offbeat of all the tracks here: A spoken story-song, recited matter-of-factly in John Cale's Welsh accent. It's about a jealous husband who, in doubt about his wife's fidelity, mails himself to her house. Sounds ordinary enough, except that there is a twist to the finale, both funny and macabre.<br /><br />This is one of the darker albums that the Velvet Underground did, as well as the last one that was so experimental. The finale is almost twenty minutes of screeching, explosive guitar riffs, and the story-song is definitely odd. But once you get into the swing of it, it's remarkably moving.<br /><br />The fuzz and wildness of \\"White Light/White Heat\\" is definitely offputting at first -- the melodies are buried under a perpetual buzz of sound. That lo-fi flavor won't be to everyone's taste, but those who like their music rough, raw and ragged will probably like the murky riffs and muffled drumming, rising out of a thick mass of fuzz.<br /><br />For those who don'ty like distortion, it might be a comfort to just focus on the offbeat lyrics -- they can be vulgar, nasty, enchanting, or they can be brimful of black comedy. At least, they are never boring. In his VU swansong, Cale gets to recite and sing, and his rich vocals prove to be somewhat more compelling than Lou Reed's.<br /><br />While perhaps the weakest, rawest and least accessible of the Velvet Underground's albums, \\"White Light/White Heat\\" has the distinction of Cale's vocals and some wickedly weird writing.rawest and least accessible of the Velvet Underground's albums, \\"White Light/White Heat\\" has the distinction of Cale's vocals and some wickedly weird writing.

0393976149|5.0|Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement.n't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well.

But I can over look that and see the film for what it was a Great film.  The story telling and the style was great.  Although I do have to say one thing.  THE DVD almost has no extras.  Doesn't even have the trailer on it.  This is just like the LOTR in that they had the cheep one then the very nice 4 disc set.  If you loved this movie and didn't download it get it other wise wait until the great 3/4 disk set comes out.  IT was very disapointing that there was almost no extras.  When I opened it and saw only one disk I was very disapointed.  The \\"behind\\" stuff they had was one TV guide channel today.  So If you can wait, I couldn't so I got it.
038572179X|5.0|During the 1990s, there was a brief flourishing of a genre of fiction known as \\"metafiction,\\" or fiction about fiction. In these stories, the lines between character and author were often blurred, and the act of writing itself became a preoccupation of the author and the stories. These stories, often too clever by half, usually descended to the realm of literary parlor game, with the author more interested in showcasing bravura technique at the expense of character development and plot (which were regarded as vestiges of earlier, primitive fictions). Alas, these clever stories lacked an essential soul, and that soul was character, and the formation of character that was plot. Metafiction today is generally regarded as a mere blip in literary history, and rightfully consigned to obscurity. It comes as quite a surprise, then, about 90% through Ian McEwan's brilliant \\"Atonement,\\" to find that the author is engaging in a rather bold-faced, and largely successful, attempt at metafiction. It is not giving anything away to say that the first 330 pages of \\"Atonement\\" are a roman a clef written fifty years after the events related in the book. If anything, this device makes the reader feel even more keenly the events of the novel and their impact on the characters, leaving the reader with the impression that the story and its characters were \\"real.\\" And the few ambiguous sentences in the last pages that make the reader question the faithfulness of the retelling--which reinforce at once the artifice of the novel in general and of Briony's novel in particular--give the epilogue as much emotional weight as the story that precedes it. The word \\"atonement\\" surfaces a couple of times late in the novel, but it is only in the metafiction-inspired epilogue that the ideal of atonement--and its futility--are truly understood. This is a wonderful, beautifully-written novel that explores the nature of guilt and the redemptive power of literature.
B00005JLO2|4.0|The Four Feathers is a period piece on English honor during their imperial conquests of the late 1800s.  The story line itself is simple.  Heath Ledger plays Harry, a soldier who resigns his commission to avoid going to war.  Wes Bentley is Jack, his loyal best friend, secretly in love with his fiance', Ethne, played by Kate Hudson.  When his friends and fiance' question his courage, he travels alone to the battlefield to regain his honor and save his friends.<br /><br />But while the story is simple, the execution is monumental.  Wes Bentley captures the angst and inner turmoil of doing everything right and still having his friend have the one thing he wants: Ethne's love.  Djimon Hounsou also shines as the Sudanese nomad who finds Harry in the desert and befriends him.  Kate Hudson and Heath Ledger's acting is good but their full ranges are not utilized here.<br /><br />This is a really good film that is a visual jewel.  This film has been judged harshly by many, and unjustly compared to the 1939 version, in my opinion.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00079ZACM<br /><br />Of the 1939 version of this film, Richard T. Jameson has said \\"A.E.W. Mason's novel of stiff-upper-lip honor and valor had already been filmed three times (and at least that many remakes have followed, superfluously). This is the only version that matters.\\"  Mr. Jameson, I beg to differ.<br /><br />The Shekhar Kapur version of this movie matters for several reasons.  Robert Richardson's cinematography is indeed masterful, with all the hughs and highlights of the desert shining.  He has elicited comparisons to Lawrence of Arabia for obvious reasons.  But don't forget Bernardo Bertolucci's \\"The Sheltering Sky.\\"  This camera work is really that good that it deserves to be compared to that class of film.<br /><br />At times the story may seem to lack flow. I believe this was intentionally directed into the film by Shekhar Kapur.  The slow uncertainty of the story acts to highlight Harry's indecision.  Kate Hudson slowly realizes she is wrong, then slowly accepts her blessings upon his return.  Harry slowly realizes his mistake and eventually goes to Sudan.  Even Harry's movement across the desert is slow.  While he quickly makes up his mind, the pace of the movie outlines the slow arduous task Harry faces in rebuilding the pieces of his life.  I believe that Shekhar Kapur has made a valuable film which displays the English fixation with honor and pride and their slow pace to change.<br /><br />I could see somebody giving this movie a 3 but no lower than that.  Overall, I think this is a beautiful film that deserves to be purchased and studied.ts to highlight Harry's indecision.

B00005JNJT|5.0|One would have thought that Batman and Robin would have been the end of the Batman film series but Batman Begins pumps new life into the franchise.  Gone from the new Batman are all of the gimmicks that turned the original series into a parody of the original film directed by Tim Burton.  Christian Bale makes an excellent Bruce Wayne, a figure who is truly haunted and searching for a meaning to life, taking the road less traveled into becoming what he hates until found by the mysterious Ducard.  Mr. Bale is excellent in the exploring the depths of Bruce Wayne as he goes from being a vengeful college student, to being a petty criminal, searching to find himself as Ducard's pupil and finally determined to rid Gotham of crime rejecting the violence of the League of Shadows.<br /><br />The film is beautifully cast, down to the smaller roles.  Michael Caine does a wonderful job as Alfred, providing a great deal of the film's humor and the necessary reassuring figure for Bruce Wayne.  Before him Michael Gough was the quintessential Alfred but Mr. Caine has made the part his own.  Katie Holmes does well as Wayne's love interest in a part that has little of the sexuality of the prior films but stands as a disapproving figure to Bruce Wayne's playboy image.  Gary Oldman was an inspired choice as Jim Gordon, Morgan Freeman is wonderful as the Wayne Enterprises head of Applied Science and Liam Neeson makes a tough minded mentor and later an effective adversary.  Cillian Murphy is very suave as Jonathan Crane transforming himself into the \\"Scarecrow\\" with a help from the mind altering drug that will shortly be used on Gotham.  I also liked seeing Rutgar Hauer (Blade Runner) in a mainstream movie; most of his film roles seeming to be released only to video.<br /><br />The film portrays Gotham as a gritty, crime-ridden city with criminals without gimmicks. The effects are limited to just telling the story, avoiding sensational extremes.  Most important, Batman Begins brings back the feel of the comic books, telling a great story.ns brings back the feel of the comic books, telling a great story.  <br />
B00005JLEJ|5.0|Kurosawa's beautiful film Kagemusha is a meditation on subjects that have haunted the director throughout his career in cinema: the doppelgager or double, (which brings to question identity and how identity is formed, and where identity is located; is it in appearance, world views, actions, attitudes or loves? How does individual choice create a man? What if one's choices were different?) transformation (all Kurosawa heroes go through a transformation) the tragedy of war (note the elegaic images of horses struggling in death throes in the aftermath of the massacre at the film's conlcusion) and despair (Kuroswa has investigated despair as few other filmmakers have...from The Lower Depths and Stray Dog to Ran, many of his films meditate deeply on human hearts without hope).<br /><br />I cannot help but think that Kagemusha's deep feeling comes from the autobiographical: a man (the thief, played by Tatsuya Nakadai) must assume the role of the Lord (or, why not...they say it in the film...\\"Tenno\\"...or Emperor...used to describe Kurosaw himself).<br /><br />Kuroaswa must have wondered, in his time of financial difficulty, after the dismissal of \\"Dodes-Kaden\\", after his suicide attempt, after losing his status, during his struggles to find financing for Kagemusha...he must have thought about what it is to assume a role of great authority, and to be dismissed from the role that gave his life meaning.<br /><br />Tatsuya Nakadai being ejected forcibly from the castle...retainers throwing clods of mud and stones after him, like a stray dog being pelted and driven from the gates of a house...maybe Kurosawa felt that this is how his life had been. He has said, \\"I am afraid that me minus movies equals nothing\\". His identity, so involved in the creation of film, in making his meditations and dreams communicated through the medium of film, and the life that grew up around the creation...the friendships, the experiences, the world of making that makes a world...it must have been horrible for him to realize how fragile and easily shattered that world could be!<br /><br />Federico Fellini once said in an interview that criticism felt somehow impertinent...that his work was a reflection of who he was as a human being, and to judge one's work seemed an insult. I remember this as I think about Kagemusha and the other films of Akira Kurosawa. It is with great humility that I approach my thinking about these films, and would refuse, even if forced, to rank them. That really would be impertinent, and an insult to a life dedicated to the highest good an artist can achieve: an honest look at human experience with the intent of understanding the mysteries of the human heart.been horrible for him to realize how fragile and easily shattered that world could be! <br /> <br />Federico Fellini once said in an interview that criticism felt somehow impertinent...that his work was a reflection of who he was as a human being, and to judge one's work seemed an insult.

B000003TAR|1.0|I'm sorry, writers Rolling Stone and Spin, but your very-wrong and distorted perception that Nirvana and Kurt Cobain were the saviors of anything are coming to the inevitable halt that all music fads and ganky suicidal rock stars do. You've had your time to reminisces-- I know you can't let go of the band that sells your magazines, but try (or at least latch onto some other talentless dead or dying musician for a while-- like the half-dead zombie Bob Dylan). The only legacy that Kurt Cobain has to carry on to future decades is his phony \\"rebellious\\" public image that sells overpriced hoodies, marijuana rolling papers, and other \\"indie\\" propaganda. It's now 2005, in case your heroin-induced, decade-long cultural blackout hasn't ended. Kurt Cobain wasn't a musical maelstrom; he was a piss-party that rained on everyone's parade. He cared for nobody but himself. The only reason he kept playing arena gigs was for the million dollars he acquired every month for doing so. Money was the only reason anyone (especially a miserable sad sack like him) would keep playing for fans he despised. Stupid lemmings.
B000AP04FG|4.0|Wow, when i went to the theater i didn't know what to expect from this movie. i thought it was mostly going to be action-packed but i was surprised at how funny the movie was. Brad Pitt was surprisingly funny and he played his part well. Angelina Jolie was great as well.  I've never seen any hotter actors together in a movie before, and both Brad and Angelina were definitely the main ingredients. When you watch the movie you can just see the sizzle coming out of the screen!! they were great and had amazing amazing chemistry. If you want to see a fun movie that has action and comedy combined, i recommend this movie. ENJOY!!!!
B000957O82|3.0|This is a typical romantic comedy.  The main character Hitch is a \\"date doctor\\" who coaches men unable to get to the first kiss point of a relationship. In a nutshell, he coaches dorky guys to get a girlfriend.  Kevin James plays an overweight, nervous, uptight guy who is in love with a rich media darling whose accounts he manages.  Of course, the girl never notices him and he seeks out Hitch to help him \\"get the girl\\".  The second storyline in the movie is abut Hitch getting together with a girl (Eva Mendez) who isn't all that interested in dating.  I thought this storyline was pretty predicable and in the end it actually got pretty pathetic.  Overall,  the movie has some very funny highs in it and it is worth renting for a nice Friday or Saturday night in with your boyfriend or girlfriend.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Now I just got this DVD yesterday at Game Stop (I was lucky enough to find it used for only $16.99) and I was amazed at how many bonus features there are! I was a little surprised, because the bonus features are 190 minutes, where as the movie itself is only 84! I'm telling you, you shouldn't be spending the money on the movie itself, because the bonus features make this DVD! I felt so lucky when I got this because I did some reasearch, and this DVD is worth $70.00! I used to have the original VHS version from the '90s, but it broke about 5 or 6 years back. Then when this DVD came out, I wanted it, but never got around to it! All-in-all, this is one of the best DVDs in history. A lot of work was put into it, and you can tell. Thanks, Disney!

The album continues with other slightly harder rock tunes with an occasional acoustic track here and there. Ian Anderson's lyrics are also quite interesting, some written to his first wife at the time. \\"To Cry You A Song\\" and \\"Sossity\\" are interesting none the less. I recommend this album to anyone who likes classic rock.

Just to think that I could have the original \\"Black Diamond\\" version, the Platinum Version, AND a \\"Work-in-progress\\" version ALL on one disc is crazy! Too bad this DVD is out of print. I wish that they wouldn't make the platinum editions go out of print. I was lucky enough to find a used verion of the Platinum \\"Snow White\\" for $16.99 at game stop (2-disc). I really want this DVD version with all 3 versions of the film. By the way, \\"Human Again\\" has outstanding color and animation, not to mention, it is seamlessly added into the film, which I found amazing! Go buy this DVD NOW (hopefully I'll find it somewhere!)    EDIT: AUGUST 4, 2006: I found this on DVD, and I must say, I am very pleased! Disney really did well on this! \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" 's next release will be sometime in 2012.

If that's your first and foremost wish, get the Frederic Mitterand 1995 film with the Chinese soprano (now THAT should get rave reviews, shouldn't it, because she's got the Oriental eyes; and the Tunisian location will easily fool you into thinking that this indeed is Nagasaki). For everyone else, I wholeheartedly recommend the Karajan/Domingo/Freni version. It's got depth. It hasn't got dental perfection. Thankfully.

The answer of this book is that religion is the problem and it shouldn't exist.<br /><br />There are several problems here, first among them is the simple minded idea that `religion' is defined as basically the big two:  Christianity and Islam, with Judaism thrown in for good measure so it to can get blamed for something.  However secularism is also a religious belief system, communism is religious in its doctrinal ideas and rejection of `heresy'.  Religion is not just what we think of as religion, rather religion has always existed and crushing the two main religions that exist in the world today won't end religious violence.  People yearn for a higher power and holy book and in general they yearn for fanaticism and a black and white world.  We see today in the liberal acceptance and support for militant Islam simply a refreshing of the leftist communist view that the world is Black and white and Islam is simply another version of communism where everyone is either a `believer' or an `unbeliever'.<br /><br />The solution posed here is that religion is responsible for everything.  The Holocaust is blamed on the Jews and the Catholics, an odd twist since not only were the Jews the main victims, but Catholics priests were also killed and Nazism was a pagan barbarian idea based on idealistic utopian ideas of socialism and futurism.  Nazism was a religion unto itself, but it wasn't Christianity they birthed Nazism.<br /><br />Bill Graham and the evangelicals and the Born again Christians of America are compared in this book to Bin Laden, but there is no comparison, while one advocates the murder of civilians to conquer the world, the other plays with ideas of salvation and rebirth in Christ, no suicide bombers are found there.  Hinduism, Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, these other religions don't come in for much critique but this book apparently advocates their suppression as well.<br /><br />Since most leftists have suddenly found themselves loving religion again and telling us we must be tolerant it is good to see a book that dares to open peoples mind and tell us not to be too tolerant of religion and this is a necessary message.  However the conclusion may not be correct.  The destruction of organized religion and the imposition of rationality will only lead to a new religion, and a new fanaticism.induism, Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, these other religions don't come in for much critique but this book apparently advocates their suppression as well. <br /> <br />Since most leftists have suddenly found themselves loving religion again and telling us we must be tolerant it is good to see a book that dares to open peoples mind and tell us not to be too tolerant of religion and this is a necessary message.

B000000Y87|5.0|Alright, alright, it's all been said...but the reviews (including this one) can't do this CD justice.  As a bassist for almost 30 years, I have to say that there is no other album that has instilled a sense of awe in me as this one has.  Scott LaFaro was just the best, and would have been universally recognized as such had he been around a little longer.  But we know, don't we, that HE was the one that removed the label of \\"supporting role\\" from the instrument.  HE is the one who is more highly imitated in chamber jazz than any other.  And of the too few recordings of this famous \\"first trio\\", this is the one that ties together all that Bill Evans was trying to accomplish as the leader of a trio.  For that, this CD should not only occupy the same shelf space as \\"Kind of Blue\\", but should be placed ahead of it (blasphemy to some, I know) in listening order.  If you don't have this one, even if you have \\"Kind of Blue\\", your jazz collection is incomplete.  Stop reading and just listen!
0895260131|5.0|In regards to Islam the entire world, especially the western world has had the wool pulled over its eyes.  Beginning with the romantic version of Islam as brought back by Sir Richard Francis Burton and T.E. Lawrence the English speaking world has been enamored with Muslims.  Then came September 11th.  Since then every American and most in the world who are non-Muslims have been indoctrinated with the zombie-like incantation \\"Islam is a religion of peace\\".  Furthermore such key concepts of the reason why 9/11 happened have been turned on their heads.  `Jihad' has been told to us that it means `inner struggle' and in fact that `holy war' is therefore peaceful.  We have been brainwashed to believe that Islamic veils and `hajib' or the veering of women is actually liberating for women and liberal western women are the number one converts to Islam because of this propaganda.  We have been told that Islam is the most peaceful religion, as if such a thing is possible, and that Islamic slavery was `humane' and that Islamic Dhimmi law is actually a wonderful way for people to live as second class citizens.  The fact that Islam took over 1/3 of the world and committed genocide against millions of non-Arab and non-Muslims peoples and destroyed 1000s of native religions is brushed over, while any instance where those who were colonized by Muslims and dared to defend themselves is characterized as `religious hatred' by the non-Muslims.  In short, in the last 4 years the entire world has been caught up in a mass psychosis that only books like this can relieve.  This is the proscription.  Truth and honesty is the proscription. Since not everyone can go out and read every Hadith, digest every Sunna, visit every muslim country, read the Koran in its original, learn the differences between Alawites and Sufis and go on the Haj and since not everyone knows the intricate history of all the myriad conflicts in the world involving Muslims against non-Muslims, this book is a useful primer.<br /><br />This book dares to dispute the unthinkable.  It dares to question all these closed minded assertions we have heard.  It dares to ask `perhaps Islam isn't a religion of peace'  and examine `when was Islam peaceful?'.  Has their been one year in the entire history of Islam where a Jihadist hasn't murdered a non-muslim for the very simple reason that he wasn't a `believer'.  This book finally sheds true light on the treatment of homosexuals and women and minorities in Muslim countries.  We were brainwashed to believe that the Iranian revolution and its forced veiling of an entire nation of women was a wonderful thing, we were told that the fact that Iranian non-muslims became second class citizens was  a value we should strive for and that executing and beheading men for committing homosexualits was therefore a great value.  Well we were lied to, this book gives out truth and dares to break down walls of accepted idiocy.  Finally we will learn the truth behind the crusades, that in fact Saladin was intolerant and destroyed churches and crusaders were part of a long running war.<br /><br />Seth J.

I ordered this CD, and also searched the globe (literally) for \\"Breathe Me, Pt. 2, which contains the original version as well as four or five remixes. It's out of print, but I finally found it at Amazon Japan. The shipping is more than the cost of the CD, but after hearing the clips, I'm sure it'll be worth the cost.

B0006L16N8|2.0|I've heard all this hoopla about Coldplay and finally gave them a listen. I can sum them up in one word: BORING. People sell their children for concert tickets to listen to these guys play? <br />I was expecting some catchy tunes and maybe some energy. Instead, these guys sound like they're sleepwalking through the music - I know I fell asleep listening to them. The funniest thing, is the biggest hit from the new album (Speed of Sound) sounds just like the biggest hit from the last album (Clocks). <br />I'm not saying their music is bad, I just don't understand how they became a huge sensation. I guess its popular to jump on the Coldplay bandwagon right now. I'll gladly sit on the side and watch that wagon crawl by.
0743424425|5.0|There is not much I can add to the already mountain of reviews on the Shining, but here goes.<br /><br />After reading the Gunslinger, (my first Stepehn King book) I set off to my local bookstore to pick up book 2 in the series, only to find that it was sold out. I needed a good read, and had seen the movie, so I decided to try the Shining. It exceeded my expectations by a mile.<br /><br />1) I am an avid reader, but the thought of purchasing a 683 page book was intimidating. I tend to toss out 4 books after page fifty for every one book I finish. If I can't get into the story, I move on. With that said, I read this book in 4 days. I literally didn't want to put it down. That is the greatest compliment I can pay the Shining. It was a fast read.<br /><br />2) Characters. The Shining contains brilliantly crafted characters and reminded me why I find so many other books unreadable: lack of compelling characters. Jack, Wendy, Danny, Ullman and Hallorann are believable and engaging.<br /><br />3) The story. The story was wonderful. I had never read what some call a pure \\"horror\\" book before (or one with ghostts, etc), so I had few expectations. When the book was done I found that I had read a story about people first and foremost. Stephen King doesn't use distractions and cliches in place of writing a good tale. The story came first, then the evil spirits.<br /><br />4) The book version of the Shining is like a whole cooked chicken. The movie is like a chicken McNugget. Somewhat similiar, but has many mystery parts.<br /><br />And last, I found something odd...<br /><br />On page 404 (which happens to be an ERROR PAGE in computer lingo) I noticed that Jack Torrance became JOHN Torrance. This mistake only happened on Page 404. Any other book and I wouldn't have batted an eye, but when I find errors on page 404 with Stephen King, I became curious as to their intentionality?<br /><br />Might have been a fluke, but a fluke on page 404 none-the-less. Maybe even Stepehen King's errors have an odd reality like the Gunslinger's universe.n Stepehen King's errors have an odd reality like the Gunslinger's universe.

B000A2IPP0|5.0|I just want to go on record as saying this is a great movie.  I've been watching a lot of the most famous movies of all time, and few of them hold up like this does.  It is one of the few that merits a five star rating.<br /><br />Elliott, and Drew Barrymore, put on great performances as children.  I can't remember when I've seen such good acting from little kids.<br /><br />It's a very emotional and warm and fuzzy film.
B00066VUPM|5.0|It was by accident that I came upon Travis' CDs in the record store. Similar to what most people would do, I thought that purchasing the band's greatest hits would be a better bargain than picking up individual album, as I was new to the band. Then I took the CD home and put it in the player. Right after the first listen, I knew I was hooked. <br /> <br />\\"Sing\\" is a perfect opener for the compilation (also for their album \\"The Invisible Band\\"). It kicks off rather oddly with some bizarre artificial sounds, then proceeding into a mid-tempo, melodious tune. Fran Healy's voice is pleasant to the ear, and the instrumentation is sleek, brisk, but not overproduced. The whole CD continues in the similar fashion, with highs and lows of vocal delivery and mild shift of tempo from song to song. The standouts for me are the aforementioned \\"Sing,\\" the spry \\"Driftwood,\\" the cute \\"Why Does It Always Rain on Me,\\" the somewhat somber \\"Love Will Come Through,\\" and the fan favorite \\"Turn.\\" <br /> <br />Some reviewers complained that the songs are not placed in the chronological order. In my humble opinion, however, the misplacement makes the disc fun to listen to. Casual fans would not be under the impression of what each album sounds like by merely listening to several songs. Moreover, Travis' songs tend to have a \\"samey\\" feel which prevents any song from appearing incongruous. <br /> <br />Overall, this \\"Singles\\" compilation provides an incredible listening experience, like a breeze in the summer days, lovely, comforting, and engaging. As an introduction to the band, it certainly kindles my interest in seeking their other releases.
0790731002|4.0|Director Joel Schumacher is a semi-talented hack.  Val Kilmer seems bored with the whole enterprise.  Tommy Lee Jones as Harvey Two-Face does nothing to distinguish himself except for an annoying cackle.  Jim Carrey, while engaging, seems to have transported his Ace Ventura/Fire Marshall Bill characters into the Riddler costume.  The garish art direction gave me a headache.  Despite all that I still liked this film.  Credit has to be given to a literate script that includes a contribution by Akiva Goldsman(\\"A Beautiful Mind\\") that attempts to delve into the psyche of the Dark Knight.  Chris O'Donnell gives a good account of Dick Grayson/Robin whose backstory eerily mirrors Bruce Wayne/Batman.  It was also good to see the role of Alfred the Butler expanded and give the excellent British actor Michael Gough a moment in the spotlight.  Not great but not bad either.
B00005JN5X|4.0|In a lot of ways, this film was like 'A Beautiful Mind' where he lived out his spy fantasies.  The Brothers lived through all of the scary fairytales they enscribed into book form.  Some describe it as just a story to scare children, but it was much more.  There was a lot of witchcraft with the symbols involved.    Once upon a time, in 1796, the Grimms not only wrote those scary tales, they lived through and researched them.  Many were pranks which turned dangerous, and others were full-fledged nightmares.  The peg-legged man was like the wood figurine I have had for a long time.    Matt Damon was fabulous as Will, the good-looking Grimm and looked the part exactly.  The owl moving its head around is like the false one here near Krutch Park.  Eat your heart out, Arthur Friend.  The frisky brown mare was like those they use at the Civil War re-enactments here in Tennessee.  They lived all that stuff they wrote -- it was not a figment of their imaginations.    In the tower in the middle of an enchanted forest in Germany, they found the Book of Spells where the ancient Queen awaited the last (twelfth) girl's death to make her young and beautiful again.  As the revived Queen, she was exactly like Poe's Ligeia.    The French General's statesman looked like our Admiral Farragut.  Unemotional Mark Hairr of KAT fame, was at the formal dinner as they authenticated the enchantment.  The lively music for the executions as entertainment was like James Cameron's.  The ferocious wolf with the blue eyes which turned into a werewolf was Angelina's father, the suitor of the old Queen.  He seduced the young girls to a point where they were entranced by a horse who entraps them in a net and swallows them.  Sasha is saved from having to end up in the twelfth crypt which encircles the tower (looked like a lighthouse) in the German woods.    The French Revolution was in full swing (Merci) and the boomerang axe which was enchanted, as well, was a good touch.  I liked the monkey jumping around on the mantle as they played \\"Lullaby and Good Night.\\"  The ravens eating the bread crumbs of Gretel was cleverly done.  The old man with the long beard and lantern looked like Tommy.  The white horse was fab.  The German march music as we see the beautiful landscape and countryside was stirring.    The woods were heavily populated with all kinds of fowl, snakes, toad (with his white frog's legs).  One thing I didn't like was when the trapper skinned and deblooded the skinny animal which could have been an alley cat.  Jacob did some good acting at the grass-covered spring house in the dark forest of superstition.  The strange catapalts were overcomplicated.  They used a divining fork, which they considered as sophisticated technology.    Will contemplates life without Jacob as he struggles to reach the peak of the tower.  They find treasure in the tower room as in the Egyptian tombs.  The General's \\"dummy\\" assistant was a good actor.  Viva Revolution! Mark Savage.    Will tells Jacob, \\"We can give it a happy ending.\\"  The eclipse was the time when the Queen was rejuvenated.  The ending was overdone a bit.  They'd used cannons to set the woods on fire, and the old Queen's magic put out the fires.  They used a French flag to defend themselves against the General's sword.  Too bad it wasn't the fighting Confederate flag.    Farewell to your tales, they will not be remembered.  Wrong!  You know the end of the story.  It was most entertaining and the special effects were nice.  We had quite a diverse audience at the showing I attended.
0790730960|4.0|\\"Batman Returns\\" was considered something of a disappointment after the success of the original \\"Batman\\".  Watching it again there is alot here to recommend.  In the original film the look of Gotham City was as much a character as any of the actors.  Art director Bo Welch picks up the ball from Anton Furst and has designed a look that is at once Capraesque and Dickensian slum.  Michael Keaton digs deeper into the duality of Bruce Wayne/Batman and his performance is the better for it.  I think alot of this has to do with him playing off his polar opposite in Selina Kyle/Catwoman who channels her dark side towards malevolence instead of good.  Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as Catwoman, at once sleek as a cat yet lethal at the same time.  The major misstep in the film is the characterization of the Penguin.  I do not blame Danny DeVito for this because he did not conceive this odiously freakish character or the prosthetics that he wears.  This character just does not fit into the framework of the film and only detracts from the film's main story involving the Batman/Catwoman conflict.  On the other hand, Christopher Walken as slimy industrialist Max Shreck does a memorable turn in the inimitable way that Walken excels at in a lowkey way and only a gray dye-job.  Credit director Tim Burton who handed a franchise film did not take the easy route and attempted to inject some freshness to the film.  While not wholly successful this is a good entry in the \\"Batman\\" canon.
068987474X|4.0|Whether you don't know what's going on with your current fling, or curious about what your ex was thinking, this book will certainly give you some insight. This book gives all the common signs that he's just not into you, and shoots down all the excuses women make for their men. If you've ever had a failed relationship (and who hasn't?) You will definitely see glimpses of your experiance in the pages of this book. (I was kind of seeing a guy once and I swear 3 or more chapters in this book were written about him.)<br /><br />This book will make you laugh, or at least make you smile, either from recognition or seeing how dense some women can be. The authors certainly have a way of putting relationships into a perspective that is so simple, you can't help but see the humor.<br /><br />There's a good chance that you you aren't going to beleive every word the authors say. But the core of the message is true. If the truth ISN'T that the Jerk you're seeing isn't that into you, then he's still a jerk and you still deserve better.<br /><br />Overall, this book is not a difficult or challenging read, it's not a piece of scientific research, it's simple, concise, and can be read in one day. It's funny to read at any time, and would probably make good \\"comfort food\\" for someone going through a break-up.

Half way through the book I realized he had only made a few points, though still taking you through the memory walk. I was so dissapointed, I couldn't even bring myself to finish it.

B00003CX9E|1.0|It would be difficult to find a movie more boring than this. THIS MOVIE IS MADE TO BORE YOU. I really don't know anything good to say about Citizen Kane except the fact that it is so bad that all the commentaries in the dvd and good reviews from famous critics can't even save this terrible film.
B00023B1LC|2.0|Who is Jason Bourne, really?  Let's see...people are trying to kill him.  Clue #1.  He's somehow very good at anticipating trouble, and equally proficient at encountering and escaping.  Clues #2 & #3.  Of course, viewers are shown scenes of CIA honchos flustered by Jason's \\"loose canon\\" status.  Huge Clue #4.  What could Jason be????  The biggest flaw of this \\"suspense-thriller\\" is that we already know most of the answers within minutes of the opening.  Additionally...and I believe the lack of a soundtrack creates this problem...despite the action, there's not much thrill to this movie.  Assassins come after Jason and his new gal pal, and we pretty safely figure they'll escape them, and most of the bad guys will either die or be knocked out.  So, we're left with an amnesiac who can't figure out what seems obvious to viewers--even though he's got CIA-instilled intelligence instincts!!  He dodges repeated attempts on his life, and winds his way to a safe, open-ended ending that I will not reveal. <br /> <br />Bottom line:  The film garners two stars in that there is a uniqueness and a curiosity to the story.  The action, while not enough to keep me on the edge of my seat, did keep me mildly engaged.  This is a James Bond type film, that falters by taking itself a bit too seriously.

Fans of Buffy/Angel.  People who watch things like 24 and Lost and think that they're more worth because they're not set in space, get a grip and try out this show.  This show doesn't suck. This show is fun, funny, serious when it needs to be, well written and it's cancelled.
B0009YA37W|1.0|The first time I played this CD I actually pulled it out of the player and looked at it.  This band isn't \\"in the style of\\" Interpol, or \\"influenced\\" by Interpol -- this is an IMPRESSION.  This is an IMITATION.  In twenty years when you see Interpol tribute bands playing your local saloon, they'll only wish they sounded as much like Interpol as the Editors. <br /> <br />Personally, I wouldn't listen to this CD twice.  First, mediocre Interpol isn't that good -- as their second album shows.  Second, a band needs an identity, and not one taken from another group.   <br />
0895260131|5.0|Given the state of the world in 2005, you owe it to yourself, your family, and society at large to read this book and inform yourself about the true nature of Islamofascist forces at work in the world today. Islamofascists steep themselves in a 7th Century ideology, that despite hundreds of years of growth and development, still resonate for them. Sun Tzu wisely counseled, \\"Know your enemy,\\" and that advice is particularly true today. Forget what the MSM has proffered re: Islam, read this book and get the straight dope from a man who's invested over twenty years of his in it's study.    Robert Spencer has divided The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (And the Crusades) into three parts ...  Part I: Islam - which discusses Mohammad and Islam as a religion of war and intolerance which is responsible for the death of the \\"Golden Age\\";  Part II: The Crusades - which looks at the origin of the Crusades, what they did and didn't accomplish, and what the world might be like today had the Crusades never happened; and   Part III: Today's Jihad - in which he examines the nature of today's Islamofacists, what they purport to be fighting for, the cost of maintaining politically correct myths about Islam, \\"Islamophobia\\" and critizing Islam are used as weapons by Islamofacists, and why the West must engage and defeat Islamofacism.    Throughout each part of The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (And the Crusades) Robert Spencer presents solidly documented information about Islam, and in the process debunks numerous persistent myths. For example, on page 47 he considers the myth that Islam is a tolerant faith ... except that Islamic law mandates second-class status for all non-Muslims, these laws have never been abrogated or revised by any Islamic authority, and all non-muslims are given three choices: conversion, subjugation, or death. Another feature highlighted throughout the book are other \\"Books You're Not Supposed To Read,\\" such as The Raft of Mohammed by Jean-Pierre Peroncel-Hugoz shown on page 207.    All in all, this is a very interesting, informative, and enlightening book on a subject that's not very well known, typically poorly presented in the MSM, and about which there continues to be a good deal of controversy and disagreement.    (...)    If after reading this book you thirst for more information, I refer you to ...    (...)    If you still don't \\"get it\\" after reading The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (And the Crusades) and/or any/all of the additional resources I've listed above, it won't be for lack of solid information on the subject.
0780020685|5.0|For all those film goers wanting to make the leap from mainstream (ie: hollywood, colour, english language, no subtitles, widescreen and of course... made in the last few years)to anything but mainstream,  you really can't get better than Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai. <br /> <br />Not to say you'll be jumping for joy and saying this is the best movie you've ever seen after your first viewing of it.... but it is the kind of movie that you will want to watch over and over again. <br /> <br />And on each viewing you will pick up more, you will see how the simplest of stories does have so many sub stories, and you will see how the actors (including Toshiro Mifune) and Kurosawa are masters in making this story not only come to life, but at the same time tug at your heart. <br /> <br />So take the leap, accept the subtitles, engrace all 200+ minutes of the movie and I guarantee you that you will not be disappointed. <br />
0802130208|1.0|I started this book twice (I stopped to read another book) and after reading about 100 pages, I still don't like it but I think I have a revelation.<br /><br />Most reviews of this book say how \\"hilarious\\" and \\"gut-bustingly\\" funny it is. I don't think it's funny at all; I don't think it was intended to be funny. I think the author created a character based on himself and this is how he saw the world. Ignatius seems to have major mental issues and is seriously detached from real life. His behavior isn't comical or quirky, it seems to border on insanity. I don't really understand the appeal of this book filled with unappealing characters.
0790729350|5.0|This is a great movie.  I've seen it a ton of times.  And it was amazing how many people showed up to this invent.  I am a big fan of Jimi Hendrix and I loved his version of the Star Spangled Banner.  I liked the Who's performance.  And Richie Havens singing Freedom.  Also Sly and the Family Stone singing I Wanna Take You Higher and Sly doing a little dance.  And Country Joe and the Fish singing that song about the war.  The whole movie is great.  Anybody that hasn't seen it should see it.

B00005JNTX|4.0|Computer graphic images that tell the tales in \\"Sin City\\" are not unique, as claimed by other reviewers, or even unusual. They've been used before, most recently in \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.\\" But they have never been executed with the  sophistication that directors Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller and Quentin Tarentino (who directed one scene) display in this pastiche of Miller's comic books --- err, excuse me, \\"graphic novels,\\" in the parlance used today to elevate the stature of cartoonists by those unaware of the stature cartooning long ago achieved. The trilogy of Miller movies that Rodriguez plans must now be measured against this dazzling mosaic.    It won't dazzle everyone, not with its dismemberments and disembowelments, castrations, misogyny (women are trashed or trashy), rampant immorality and corruption. But adventurers will sit transfixed by the three linked stories that pay tribute to film noir, the only way to film Miller. Violence, cynicism and outrageous behavior are his forte. All of the action, acting and direction are over the top and below the belt. \\"Sin City\\" is as sexual as anything likely to silence you in your seat this year.     The stories are of an ailing cop (Bruce Willis) who rescues from a pervert (Nick Stahl) a pubescent girl who grows up to love him, an ugly ruffian (Mickey Rourke) who seeks the killer of a whore who loved him, and the protector (Clive Owen) of a whore (Rosario Dawson) whose gang is under attack by really bad guys. Plot points are resolved in a bath of brutality and bloodshed, exquisitely rendered in black-and-white CG images wed to live actors and accented with bright colors, mostly blood red.     Heartthrob Josh Hartnet, a creepy Benecio del Toro and, as a cannibalistic killer, elfin Elijah Wood are in the remarkable cast. This is not an actor's movie. although Willis and Rourke give mature performances and the very British Owen is as hard-boiled as early Burt Lancaster. Rodriquez, who is inventing a genre here, has set casting, thematic and technical standards that heighten our expectations (Peter Jackson met them with his \\"Rings\\" cycle.) It is not an overstatement to say that \\"Sin City\\" is an amazing motion picture. Bizarre, but amazing.
B0008ISM40|1.0|This not a review of the album itself. I hear the album is awesome and is reminiscent of the downward spiral.  <br /> <br />I wish I could review the Music but I have a small apartment and so use my pc exclusively for multimedia entertainment.  I did not realize until I received this that the CD SIDE ON DUAL DISCS DOES NOT PLAY ON PC CD DRIVES!  The DVD side does play.  Google this topic and you will see this is true. <br /> <br />I understand that record companies need to protect themselves from pirates but many people have home theatre PC's and MP3 players and no longer have a plain jane cd or dvd player.  Unless I borrow my friends boom box this cd is worthless to me.  It is too bad the record company could not be more forthcoming about this \\"incompatibility.\\"   <br /> <br />Even though there will be a penalty because I had to open it, I will return it.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is, in my opinion, not Green Day's best (they were better during the Dookie era), but it is definitely AWESOME!!!!! Each track has its own meaning that goes along with the story that basically criticizes the US.  'American Idiot' is a great starter for the album, as it encompasses the whole idea. 'Holiday' is a song about war with an amazing guitar solo from Billy Joe Armstrong, that I cannot stop listening to.  It's an addiction! 'Boulevard Broken Dreams' has a very catchy tune, and it's an amazing song, despite the fact that it has two lines (I walk a lonely road, I walk a lonely road, I walk a lonely road, I walk a lonely road, I walk a lonely road... Oi vey.) The two rock operas, the more notable one being 'Jesus of Suburbia', are whole stories of their own (considering they're each 10 minutes long!) But don't let they're length intimidate you--they're still wonderful songs.  And finally, last but not least, the soulful track 'Wake Me Up When September Ends'.  This is Billy Joe, the frontman, singing about the death of his father.  For some reason, schools like their elementary and high school graduates singing it at their graduation ceremony. ???????????????????????? I don't know.  Anyway, I highly encourage you to buy this CD.  You will never regret it.  Anywho, I'm going to a Green Day concert in New Jersey a week from now, and I'm certainly looking forward to it.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|I'm convinced these guys just can't make a bad album. If you don't know, Clutch is just about the complete rock'n'roll package: fantastic musicians who each know where the other guys are going to be before they get there, excellent songwriting, and above all, an obvious love for what they do. Robot Hive finds the band adding keyboards, to great (understated) effect. They are perhaps not as heavy as they have been in the past, but they can still smoke every single band that makes more money than them. Not quite up there with Pure Rock Fury or Blast Tyrant, but still a must-own for anyone who knows that real rock bands don't have DJs.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Very, very funny movie with plenty of dazzling fight scenes and incredible sound!  I have not heard sound this precise in a movie in a long time.   <br /> <br />A few new faces who do a fantastic job and ideas that are so unique and refreshing that it puts a smile on your face. <br /> <br />Nothing western film makers could ever pull off, which is why it is a must see!  Motion pictures have gone down hill in the US for years except for a few gems like I, Robot, The Last Samurai, What Dreams May Come, and the Kill Bill series, among a select few others.   <br /> <br />This slump we have had has forced Westerners to take a look at a lot of foreign films, and guess what?  We love them!  You can account some of that success to the fact that American Politics/PC seem to be absent from these films.  And that's a good thing, to be sure.  But most of it comes from the beauty...the ambience of these films.   <br /> <br />Sadly though, a lot of Westerners miss a lot of what is supposed to be experienced from these films.  But I say just laugh at them and be glad that you have the capacity to enjoy it! <br /> <br />So yeah, you can't watch this movie in English.  It ruins the entire movie, as is the case with most foreign films.  Again, DO NOT BE TOO LAZY TO READ!  It's worth it times ten to just read the subtitles :)
0316172324|4.0|Gladwell knows he's no expert--he's a researcher and a writer, a listener and a storyteller. Attempting to pull together the fascinating and at times mind-boggling stories and facts in this book into a neat package of conclusions is best left to academic experts and pompous quacks, so Gladwell steers clear. You shouldn't expect to read this book and walk away with six points to remember and apply. But you can count on enjoying the sharp writing and the engaging stories. It's unbelievable that a book about the human mental capacity to make split-second decisions could be this readable.<br /><br />This book ultimately adds up to a great big \\"something to think about.\\" But the earnest work and feeling Gladwell has invested in this book of real substance make mulling it over deeply rewarding.
1577314808|5.0|The secret to Tolles book lies in letting the words work on your whole being.  If you read it with your mind (ie analyse), then you wont 'get it' because so much of what is being revealed is paradox and impossible to conceptualise with the mind. LIke so many things in life this book will appeal to some people and not to others.  Rather than analyse it for strengths and weaknesses, I would encourage people to pick it up and begin reading see whether or not it speaks to you.  If it doesn't, don't read it!  Once you start analysing it, you may as well put it down.  Personally, I found it incredibly profound and life-changing, and know of many others who feel that Tolle is a prophet of our our time.  Just read it and you'll know within the first 10 pages if its for you.

1881273156|4.0|My parents read this book and found it very helpful in their relationship. However, when they tried to apply it to their relationship with me as their son, a lot of it just didn't compute. The love between a child and a parent doesn't fit neatly into one of Chapman's five (such a small number!) love languages, regardless of how much they wanted it to.<br /><br />The truly great books that have been written teach us how complicated and messy love is and can be. Not only does Chapman undermine this lesson with his quick and easy categories, but he also severely neglects the very subject he has chosen as his title: language. Yes, \\"Words of Affirmation\\" is one of his five \\"languages,\\" but there are so many other ways in which humans use language to express love for each other besides by offering explicit affirmation. (Think, for instance, of the teasing between Fred and Ethel on \\"I Love Lucy.\\") And is it really helpful to think of receiving gifts, acts of service, and physical touch as \\"language\\"? The metaphor is detrimental. Gifts, actions, and touches can carry great meaning, but they do it in a very different way than language does. That is part of the wonder and mystery of human existence.<br /><br />Nothing can replace the use of actual language, of forming words into the spoken sentence \\"I love you.\\" Other ways of demonstrating our love for one another back up this bit of language. They do it specifically by being something other than words.

B0007Y08QA|5.0|Now, 'The Machinist' is my kinda movie.  Plot and character are important, but I find the thing that really draws me into films are the mood and the visual style.  Before watching this, I supposed it was going to be a 'weird sh*t' movie, meaning a film with a lot of odd visuals and scenes and ideas simply proceeding one after another, but with farily little in terms of plot.  I was correct.  Yeah, it tries to tie it all together at the end, and more or less succeeds, but that isn't the point of the film.  The explanation is acceptable, though certainly not remarkable, but the film doesn't play to the revelatory angle.  The final explanation is needed to justify all the strange stuff going on before hand, not the other way around.  And, this is the way it should be.  No twist can redeem a lousy, boring movie.<br /><br />This film is the story of Trevor Reznik an insomniac machine shop worker, who is clearly disturbed, as he's pretty much wasting away into nothingness, and displays some obsessive-compulsive tendencies.  One day, he's distracted during the job by a coworker, the big, rough-looking Ivan, which causes a fellow worker, Miller, to lose his arm.  While investigating the  accident, Reznik's employer's deny that any Ivan works there, and Reznik's supposes there must be some sort of conspiracy.  The rest of the film is simply his looking into what's really going on, and our peering into Reznik's troubled world and mind.<br /><br />Visually, this film comes across as a mix of two David's: Fincher and Lynch.(`Mulholland Drive' , specifically.  I'm not familiar with Lynch's work, as a whole)  The colors are muted, and it's all shot in a calm and elegant, yet distant fashion.  Lynchian surrealism comes up, via the bizarre, mysterious character Ivan, who is menacing but not altogether unfriendly, along with some of the visual aspects, particularly the otherworldly, staggeringly pristine airport diner which Trevor frequents, and a nightmarish and violent `house of horrors' sort of carnival ride he goes through.  And there are just lotsa images that are strangely effective and obscure: Ivan's pantomiming a throat slitting while sparks fly about him in the factory pit, his bright, fiercely red car in the  otherwise muted world, a strangely menacing fishing photo,  a blood-oozing refrigerator, the mysterious post-it notes, and Reznik's hollow, desiccated body.  The film just has so many strange, interesting things in it.<br /><br />`The Machinist' is interesting in that it is shown from Reznik's perspective, yet we can't hope to identify with him entirely.  The audience is bound to find out pretty quickly that Reznik is not a reliable source, and though we sees things as he does, we assume that he's pretty nuts and that there's no conspiracy, so that, in the end, the closing scenes of the film are far more revelatory to Trevor than they are to us.  (And this is, indeed, deliberate, as director Anderson explains in the commentary.)  So, it's just a sorta interesting perspective, as we spend a film watching a character unravel a mystery that  we're pretty sure doesn't exist.  (Well, he does find the real truth, eventually, but he's not really looking for it)<br /><br />Performances are all excellent.  Bale, obviously, dominates the  screen as Reznik, and is the only person who really has that big of a role.  I think he is perhaps ever so slightly over-hyped, simply because he lost so much weight for the film, but he really is great.  He plays a withdrawn man, but doesn't make him completely flat, allowing him some humor and humanity, and he plays the few scenes where he's out of control very convincingly.<br /><br />As much as I like this film, I think some people seem to be heaping excess praise onto it with regards to how it insinuates the evidence of what's really going on.  The thing is, that's all there is to the film, when you get right down to it.  It's just a bunch of hints, and a bunch of red herrings stuck together.  It'smade up of details, rather than filled with them.  I don't think it's to tough to fill your film with hints as to it's true nature when that's all there is to it.  The truly ingenious twists come when the entire film seems to be about something else, has a whole other plot, yet is still filled with clues that'll change the way you look at everything.  I don't criticize the film for not working this way, it's not trying to, but lotsa people aren't bothering to make the distinction, which I think matters, if just a little bit.<br /><br />God, it's just tough to say exactly what I mean about.  I just like the mysterious and surreal.  Real life is always so mundane, films should show us something more interesting. Screw realism, I want spectacle, something different.  This `The Machinist' has.<br /><br />Grade: A-d with them.  I don't think it's to tough to fill your film with hints as to it's true nature when that's all there is to it.

B0007GAERG|3.0|Yeah, just a tad boring.  Some truly great songs mixed in with some ho-hum songs. <br /> <br />He career started out with her ballads being her strong point.  Now it's opposite.  The stand-out songs are her upbeat songs.  <br /> <br />1. \\"Say Something\\" is my favorite song on the album.  Great drum.  Great Snoop! <br /> <br />2. \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" is gospel.  Sort of.  Second best song on the album. <br /> <br />3. \\"It's Like That\\" got me real excited for the new album.  Extremely under-appreciated first single.  I demand a re-release!!! <br /> <br />4. \\"We Belong Together\\" is a pretty ballad.  It's a nice song.  But certainly not as nice as Billboard is!  You know?!  Put on the breaks!  1 or 2 weeks at #1 is sufficient for this song! <br /> <br />5. \\"Shake It Off\\" is a song that doesn't make an impression at first.  But once you learn the lyrics, or at least the general idea, you start to notice it is a well-done track. <br /> <br />6. \\"Your Girl\\" is another great drum song.  70's R&B style.  Different vocal styling for Miss Mariah. She really means what she sings in this one. <br /> <br />7. \\"Get Your number\\" is a fun song.  Fun to sing to.  It's pretty much a duet with Jermaine Dupri.  Mariah sings the verses and Jermaine sings the chorus.  Works though. <br /> <br />8. \\"One And Only\\" is similar to \\"Breakdown.\\"  But different. As good as. <br /> <br />I will just put the other once in some order from first thought.  They are filler ballads and hip-hop. <br /> <br />9. \\"Secret Love\\" - B-side.  Not on US album.  Better than most. <br /> <br />9\10. \\"Sprung\\" - B-side. Not on US album.  Very neat sound musically.  Mariah sounds confused.  Keep up, Mariah! LOL <br /> <br />11. \\"Mine Again\\" sounds similar to \\"My All.\\"  But not quite.  Not as good. <br /> <br />12. \\"Stay The Night\\" sounds alright at first.  The goes downhill. <br /> <br />13. \\"To The Floor\\" - see \\"Stay The Night\\" <br /> <br />14. \\"Circle,\\" \\"I Wish You Knew\\" and \\"Joyride\\" - I can't even think of how theygo. <br /> <br />So 8 out of 16.  Much improved over latest material.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|Flat out, this record is not as good as their debut full-length.  They differ in very important aspects.  The first record needs to sink into you...you can't just start rocking out to it.  This album, while more ambitious, and less focused (due to the overabundance of noise/ambience which I'll discuss later) still has moments of pure riff-rock head-bangability that it leaped out to me as better...originally.<br /><br />After all, that opening cut really is killer right? Riff after riff, scream after scream, it is convincingly compelling and pure interplanetary rock...who said art couldn't rock?  Similar moments crop up across the album...see the opening of track three.  See the 2:55 section of first suite (the tracklisting on this thing is pretty terrible, please bear with me).  See the hard-rocking sax solo that blows its way into your head near the very end of the album.  Do you see my point?<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong...this album isn't anything resembling straight-forward.  TMV experiment with new sounds and textures.  The aforementioned 2:55 section has some screaming brass.  The aforementioned third cut has some very neat, off-kilter latin piano licks.  And of course, the noise/ambience.  Some may really dig this, but for most, it just eats time...sometimes I forget the record is on until I hear something start building up (one section has a nice, mellow trumpet solo...another latin sounding section, actually).  Some may see this as a welcome break between the bouts of visceral art-rock.  Personally, I could've done without it.  There's experimentation, and there's wankery.  I see this as the latter.  Without it, this would still be one of the most experimental albums out there.  So whatever...the noise is why I detract one star.  Otherwise, the riffs are tasty and creative and heavy, the vocals are conveniently high-pitched and in-your-face, and the compositions are consistently shifting and changing and sometimes meandering (in a good way).<br /><br />This record, while it has more eye-popping, heart-stopping moments than \\"De-Loused in the Comatorium\\" falls beneath that albums genius simply because of its lack of focus.  The debut record was 10 raging neo-prog, punk rock whirlwinds of sound that age extremely well.  This is kinda like that, but more long-winded.  So where \\"De-Loused...\\" is almost certainly perfect, this is kind of like \\"damn good\\".<br /><br />But don't get me wrong.  The Mars Volta and all of their releases are essential listening in this day and age of 50 cents and Simple Plans.  Invigorating, creative, powerful hard-rock.  Seriously, this band is the argument for the viability of progressive rock.  They take the progressive aspects, remove most of the wankery, and reinvigorate the rock portion.  Definitely rad.  If you ask me, you need this record and their others too.<br /><br />More like 4.75 stars./> <br />This record, while it has more eye-popping, heart-stopping moments than \\"De-Loused in the Comatorium\\" falls beneath that albums genius simply because of its lack of focus.

B0009X7664|5.0|Of course much has already been said of this classic movie.  I can only add that it does contain perhaps the greatest single male performance in movie history.  Gregory Peck's character is so dynamic, upstanding, courageous and human, that he stands above virtually all other masculine roles, and provides us with a hero for the ages.  The story is about fighting racism and injustice in the South, and Peck plays a small town lawyer who risks life and liberty to save a framed black man from the gallows.  Other heroes of like stature come to mind, seeing this movie, including Martin Luther King, Abe Lincoln, Jesus, Gandhi, and select few others.  I do wish they would make more of this type of movie.  How we do need more heroes in this weary world.

630522577X|5.0|Some say \\"Guys and Dolls,\\" or \\"Gypsy,\\" or \\"Sound of Music\\" are the best musicals of all time, but my favorite is \\"My Fair Lady.\\"  The story, borrowed from the Shaw play, \\"Pygmalian,\\" is so well adapted to the talents of Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn, two of the greatest actors of all time, that this may be the perfect musical.  Classic songs like, \\"On the Street Where You Live,\\" and \\"The Rain In Spain,\\" and \\"I''m Gettin' Married in the Morning,\\" are simply delightful and beautiful, and are presented on screen wonderfully.  It's the best collection of songs in one musical.  I simply cannot say enough.  But, then again, I am a romantic.  I recommend it for non-romantics especially -- it may get you in the mood.

Each members's top five strengths were displayed on the wall and grouped by team.  This allowed the teams to see how the strengths of its members contributed the overall team.  We basically went through the list of strengths and those who shared that strength reflected on how that contributes to their work here.  Team members gave them positive feedback on how they experieced that strength and were impacted by them.  It was encouraging, uplifting and has inspired them to work toward their strengths and focus less on weaknesses.  We would recommend it to any individual or team.
6305736650|5.0|Everyone knows by now this is one of the greatest movies of all time, with more famous lines quoted from it than any other.  Also, the trademark characters and the usual suspects.  But I recommend this movie due to the simple love story between Bogart and Bergman.  There is none better written for the screen, or portrayed.  Everyone can relate to their flawed romance, and it's why this movie is so universally appealing -- and heart-breaking.  When two people love each other, and can't seem to get together, then, find a way to mutally love each other in a new way, well, that is what life's about more often than not.  A kiss is never just a kiss.
1932100385|4.0|This is a convincing book on the topic of how animal based products can compromise your health.  However, to implement it I strongly suggest Eat to Live by Joel Fuhrman.  That book will tell you how to eat a healthy plant based diet and avoid the health problems that both books describe in detail.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|Perhaps this CD will not please the Dire Straits purists who are expecting more of the same from the early days of Dire Straits - this one has a different feel, different style.  It's a little less rock, a little more blues and country rock.  Personally, I love it.  It shows once again how varied Knopfler can be and how we can find himself in different styles. <br /> <br />Since I'm a sucker for blues, my hands-down favorite song on this album (and perhaps one of my favorite blues songs) is \\"You and Your Friend\\".  It's an underrated gem.  It has mysterious, understated, brief lyrics that leave a lot to your imagination as the instrumental improvisations take over the rest of the song.  Knopfler is stellar playing a blues guitar on this track, and Paul Franklin provides a brilliant dialogue-like backing on a steel guitar that has a truly beautiful sound.  That's right - a steel guitar.  You don't hear a whole lot of it in modern blues without it being too country, and this one is a perfect combination of influences.  This song's instrumental part is totally sinful.  Solid rhythm and excellent bass make it a well-put together sensuous, melodic song.  One reviewer called this song erotic and I agree.  This song won't have a mainstream appeal because it's got too much heart and feeling in it, but for people who can really appreciate it, it's truly a great piece.  I wish Knopfler and Franklin kept their guitars talking for longer on this song! <br /> <br />Calling Elvis is a great song with a good mainstream appeal.  Iron Hand is a nice historic ballad that makes your mind want to travel back in time and picture a Civil War battlefield with rumbling thunder of cannons and smoke floating over the battlefield.  New Orleans is another piece of interest.  It's a mysterious song that might make one think of driving on a deserted late-night city street under the glow of yellow lights. <br /> <br />Heavy Fuel will no doubt appeal to the Dire Straits purists - it's probably theonly truly rock song on this album with flashbacks to the earlier days of Dire Straits.  To me, however, it's not one of the favorite tracks on this album because it's not as melodic as some other songs on here. <br /> <br />Pretty much all songs are good here (although My Parties could be stricken from the record).  This is a truly great band.  I think this CD is definitely worth checking out!
B00005JN2Z|1.0|This movie is \\"Kitten With a Whip\\" meets \\"Terminator\\" and \\"Miami Vice\\" - but without any of the excitement, fun, plot or interest you would expect from jamming those things together.<br /><br />Tom Cruise's performance is at the center of this movie, and even though he may be a bizarre couch-bouncing Brooke Shields-berating spazz, he's still a great actor.  He and Jamie Foxx are the only two things saving this moving from direct-to-video land.<br /><br />The pacing of this movie is atrocious.  The Exposition is clunky and ponderous, and even then barely gets out amidst all of the extraneous junk in the first 15 minutes of this movie.  By the way, after the first 15 minutes,  you know exactly what is going to happen in this predictable dog.  Rather than being suspenseful or even languid, the film dithered.  Hey, it's not every movie that takes you on a detour to a jazz club.  And this movie is polite enough to stop to let coyotes cross the street.  However, even chopping out 30 minutes of tedium wouldn't help this movie, due to the plethora of other flaws.<br /><br />We see many of the most annoying movie cliches here.  Man Wrongly Accused - my wife's favorite.  Educated Successful Professional Woman Isn't Fulfilled Until Meeting Working Class Man with Heart of Gold - check.  Colombians Dealing Drugs - got that.  Captive Blows Obvious Chances to Escape - check.  Woman Needs Man to Rescue Her - yep.  We even have the Incredible Unkillable Villain, and to top it off, the Hero's Death Battle Exemption.  You can play this at home.  Blend all these together into a script over the course of a tipsy evening and you can do better than \\"Collateral\\" did.  The problem here is not just that the cliches are tedious in and of themselves; rather, they form the entire plot, such as it is.<br /><br />Before \\"Collateral,\\" the movie \\"Point Break\\" was the poster child for cheesy pure-coincidence police \\"work,\\" because one lucky break led Keanu right to the bank robbers with no need for that pesky logical analysis stuff.  But \\"Collateral\\" really takes the cake, with 4-count-em-4 unlikely-beyond-your-wildest-dreams coincidences assisting the cops in their attempt to figure out what's going on.  Because that's what makes a good crime movie - stupid cops and random coincidence.<br /><br />Michael Mann's contempt for Los Angeles drips from every frame, from the dialogue to the choice of shots and locations.  I happen to love LA (just like Randy Newman), and that was one more reason I didn't care for this movie.<br /><br />And one last thing - what the heck does the word \\"collateral\\" have to do with this movie?<br /><br />Avoid, avoid, avoid.  If you insist on seeing a Michael Mann film, rent or buy \\"Manhunter\\" instead, from a time before the director started making flabby, self-indulgent films like this.no need for that pesky logical analysis stuff.

B000AU9UYM|4.0|With a new cast, a new director and a new Batman movie, things could only go up for this, at the time, crumbling franchise. In 1989, Tim Burton brought a new face and look to what people remembered Batman as being in the 60s. Sad to say, that new look lasted six years and before you know it, Batman was as campy as ever, and with nipples.<br /><br />Well let me tell you there is no Shark Repellant Spray around the Dark Knight's belt, as this time he IS the Dark Knight. Batman is as scary and ruthless as ever, to the point where I expected Michael Keaton to be under that mask.<br /><br />Batman Begins has one of the best ensemble casts in comic book movie history, with Christian Bale, Michael Caine , Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman (the bad guy from Air Force One for the kids who don't know)and Morgan Freeman amongst others. They all deliver great performances, and made me wonder, what has Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone done lately?<br /><br />What made this movie so satisfying to me was how much time Batman/Bruce Wayne's background was explained. From Wayne's training to the creation of the Batcave and Batsuit, his almost entire history is explained, something 5 other movies and a handful of TV series forgot to mention.<br /><br />Overall, this movie was very well done, and I applaud the filmmakers for daunting a hard task; make a Batman movie, and make it GOOD! And they did just that and more. The villains are as evil as Gotham City's worst, and they are involved in some scenes that should I say are...scary? All that I can say is that I eagerly await a possible sequel, but with all the fans this movie has, it would be hard not to make one.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|I enjoyed Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow very much. It's much better on the big screen and the special effects and colorization made me think of the forties and fifties movies. Always exciting throughout.
B0000640SA|5.0|As you can see from the many other reviews, this movie is outstanding.  For those who would like to see the movie in chronological order, you should definitely buy the 2-disc \\"Limited Edition.\\"  The 2nd disk has a hidden feature that allows you to see the movie chronologically: <br /> <br />1) After inserting Disc 2, select the clock. <br />2) Select answer \\"c\\" 5 times for the questions that come up. <br />3) Select the pictures of the woman changing a tire in reverse order (3,4,1,2) <br /> <br />I would not use this feature if you have not seen the movie already, because it ruins the ending (or should I say the beginning?) of the movie.  However, it is a great feature for watching the movie over again and understanding the logical sequence of events without feeling like you have amnesia.
B00005YW4H|3.0|Norah Jones did not capture me in anyway with her voice or songs. First of all, her voice, I guess she does have good vocals but the whole southern accent just destroyed them. Second, her songs, there were a couple of good ones such as come away with me and don't know why, (and I mean exactly A COUPLE) all the other ones sucked real bad. I picked up Norah's album because she won a bunch of Grammys, but I was terribly disappointed. Even my mother, who loves these kinds of slow-moving, jazz-like songs says her songs are sooooo incredibly boring, with no tune whatsoever. I won't say that she doesn't deserve any grammy, but winning like 11 she definitely did not earn (she only wrote 3 songs out of 14!). I still don't understand how could she beat incredibly talented artists like Vanessa Carlton and Avril Lavigne, who chanllenge the music industry with their unique sound, but there's really nothing unique or good about Norah Jones. This just yet proves again that the critics of the judges are all trash.
B00003CXA6|5.0|The Civil War is an episode that somehow impregnated the American Nation about the whole understanding about United signifies. 50.ooo souls died in the battlefield in the most bloody and painful combat ever reminded in the American ground.<br /><br />Solid script, and necessarily overlong because the theme demands it. It is not a simple entertaining movie, but a superb historic recreation whose historic importance still remains in university classrooms and conferences around the world.<br /><br />Jeff Daniels and Sam Elliot have never been better.<br /><br />And please, remember King Lear: \\"Soft hearts never become swords.\\"
B0006284JQ|1.0|How much pole grease can one person slather on her body before posing for an album cover? As we can see from this photograph, it must be quite a bit. As for the music, well, I think the slapped on grease metaphor applies there as well. Enough said. I cannot believe I'm even wasting my time writing this, or that you are wasting yours reading it. Go on. Scram!!

B00005NB8K|2.0|I like the Doors music, and Morrison was a very charasmatic figure who wrote some bizzare but interesting lyrics. However, this film(unlike the comments made by most)is not a strict biography. What was covered semi-accurately in the movie was the atmosphere of the sixties and the bands beginnings. Okay, they showed the crazy drunk Morrison that perpetuates the myth, but this guy was more interesting. There are also many stupid inaccuracies. One big one that can easily be proven is the live Ed Sullivan TV appearence. Morrison did not look close into the camera and emphasize the words \\"much higher\\". I think the guy was on the wrong track big time, but that doesn't take away from his intelligence. He was very smart. The idea of this film was to show all of Morrisons wild antics. It was a big mistake to have Val Kilmer sing some Doors songs, but he did do a very good job of capturing Morrisons personality. There were definetely some good scenes that showed the bands tension and the tumultuous relationship he had with Pamela(Meg Ryan). The natural likeability side of Morrison was missing from the film. Oliver Stone(director)should have delved deeply into the fallen rock stars last days in Paris(alot of material there)which would have been a more facinating watch. Morrisons real death story, the attempted cover up, paranoia by Pam and rushed burial were also missing. Instead we got the glorified figure in the bath tub with slightly religious imagery. That is very movie phony. This guy would have looked a mess. All said and done, the film reached, grabbed on at times and let go; Hey just like Morrison.
B00003CY0V|5.0|This is a movie that I just simply enjoy, what more can I say! <br /> <br />Just get it!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is a brilliant film, which operates on several levels:  the plot for kids, the hidden nuances for their parents.  This is one of the best realized two-level films that I have seen, rivalling even that of Sesame Street and its wonderful double entendres.  We have watched this at least ten times, and I am still in awe of it.  It is a masterpiece that will become a classic like Pinocchio.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.
B000929AJQ|3.0|As allmusic states (and I agree to some stature), this record is quite good if your a big NIN fan.  Other than that, it is just going to seem like dense material that you don't understand.  Listening to the record it sounds like a hell bent man making and mixing music alone in his Louisiana home for five years.  Which in some cases can be an amazing thing, but not when you rant on about being alone and pushing everything else away and going insane from soclusion.  So, as I conclude my rant, this is a good cd.  Good, not great, but quite good if you can sit down and listen for long periods of time.  As The Fragile was, it takes a lot of indepth listening and breaking down to understand.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Siamese Dream by the Smashing Pumpkins is by far one of the best psychadelic/alternative albums ever made, and probably the best album to come out of the 90s. Like the title suggests, this is a very dreamy album. The psychadelic, distorted, whirling guitar riffs are present throughout, as are mind-blowing guitar solos. The album is a blend of metal and psychadelic rock. Throughout the 90s, the Smashing Pumpkins released some dark, gloomy albums such as Melon Collie and Gish. These albums are not very consistent, and the depressing feel makes them a bit cheesy. However, Siamese Dream is not at all depressing or gloomy since the songs are generally uplifting, and is very consistent. Each song is great and technically the album is perfect. Corgan's lyrics are brilliant, the guitar playing is superb, the dreamy feel is very effective, and Jimmy Chamberlain's drumming is outstanding. BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!
B000A7S4B0|1.0|Almost all reviewers are saying \\"how bold they are with this new sound\\" Is that a nice way to say that the songs are horrible? How is Black Rebel going to be able blow any doors off with this stuff? I feel like BRMC just lost a boxing match and is hoping to cash in on the rematch when they return to form. Waste of time and money. You might as well turn into Alanis and redo your first set of songs acoustically. Skip this one and wait 2 years.
078681859X|5.0|This book was a very good read. Both of the main characters in the book are interesting. Bartimaeus is probably my favorite character in the book. He thinks things through very well and gives a good view on what it is like to serve someone as a \\"genie\\" would. He also can be quite funny sometimes.  <br /> <br />What makes this book stand out from the rest is the notes at the bottem of most of the pages. This notes give references to previous events in bartimaeus' life, extra tid-bits of information about things said in the book, or just some of bartimaues' thoughts about things in the story(you would typically not be given this information because it does not really make the story go any further,however some of his thoughts can be very funny at times).
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah Carey's \\"We Belong Together\\" has spent 13 non-consecutive weeks on the Hot 100 chart. All of her recent success is a true testament to her talent as a recording artist. This proves once and for all that her debut album was not a fluke. Mariah is the real thing. Whether you like Mariah or not, it's time to give credit where credit is due. She has been writing great songs for years and \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" is no exception. Mariah knows what she does best. She returns to her signature sound and style for her latest release. Mariah's voice is in top form. In fact, I prefer some of the vocal performances on this album over some over earlier work. Her voice is just more mature now. She knows how to use it better and it shows. Mariah knows how to be extravagant and subtle in the only way she can. I'm so glad that Mariah made another album. This was a comeback worth waiting for.
B000002UAR|5.0|This album just reeks of brilliance... where to begin... First off, each song is great. Every song on this album is catchy but have a certain level of depth that keep the songs from getting irritating after a while. For example, most pop songs today and in history have a short lived populatrity because people get bored of the catchy hook... however with the tracks on Revolver, the songs stay fresh even after the 100th listen (with the exception of \\"Yellow Submarine\\" which I find is the only annoying song on the album\\"). The Beatles incorporated the perfect amount of psychadelia in this album, which is unlike many bands who go totally overboard, and thats just annoying. IF YOU WANT AN ALBUM WHICH YOU CAN SIT THROUGH WITHOUT GETTING BORED FOR A SINGLE SECOND, BUY THIS ALBUM.
B00005176F|5.0|As with any `Best of' by any artiste, there are always songs that every fan feels should have made the cut but didn't. However, this is still a fab collection, and a brilliant introduction to the music of Blur for the newcomer.<br /><br />Most of their big hits (up to 2000) are here; `Country house' (which trumped Oasis to the #1 spot in the UK, the dance/rock anthems `Parklife' and `Girls & boys' (on which acts like Franz Ferdinand's careers are based, LOL!), the epic sweeping ballad `Universal', the beautiful ballads `She's so high' and `This is a low', and the very American grunge sound of the energetic `Song 2' to name a few.<br /><br />New tracks like `Music is my radar' are the closest to their newer, experimental direction on `Think tank'. It's interesting to watch their musical growth as each song progresses.<br /><br />My version of the CD comes with a bonus disc with live tracks.<br /><br />Brit pop at its best!
B00006AW2M|3.0|This album is extreamly underrated. It doesn't \\"sucks\\" as far too many people says. Compared to SGT. PEPPER, well, it's nothing. The Stones were'nt just as good as The Beatles when it came to making phsycedelia, but, even if it went a bit too fast in the Stones evovement at this time, this is still recalling the vibes from '67 and the summer of love.  <br /> <br />The beautiful, flower powerish \\"She's A Rainbow\\" is the only \\"classic\\" from this album, and the best song, one of Stones greatest all over, in fact. \\"Citadel\\", som kind of psychedelic heavy metal, and \\"In Another Land\\", Bill Wymans LSD dream, links up there with the best songs on this piece of plastic. \\"Sing This All Together\\" and \\"2000 Light-Years From Home\\" are both good songs. But there are two big missteps, that's reducing the quality. The too-much-far-out \\"Sing This All Together (See What Happens)\\" and the pathetic illusion of Beatles \\"Sgt. Peppers Lonley Hearts Club Band (Reprise)\\", the closing track \\"On With The Show\\". <br /> <br />The album is very far out, it contains no non-phsycedelic <br />songs (\\"The Lantern\\" and \\"2000 Man\\" are more \\"normal\\" than the others, but still strange), but if you are a fan of phsycedelia, you should definetly try The Stones \\"little misstep\\" out. <br /> <br />(Forgive me if I'm using incorrect English, I'm just a 14-year old boy from Sweden) <br /> <br />
B0001BS4Q0|5.0|I was asking my best friend, who watched the Six Feet Under Series with me (big fans), Who sang the ending song of the show, with Clair riding off into the future. He told me Sia, and the song \\"Breathe Me\\" We listened to the song about 5 times. What a perfect song for that show, and for Clair. I definitely want to hear what else Sia sings. I'm a 54 year old woman who likes music of all types, and I listen to alot of the music my children have listened to and do listen to. I think my youngest daughter (23) has heard of Sia. I will instant message her from New York State to the State of California. If she has not heard of Sia, I hope she will go onto her music downloading sites and check at least \\"Breathe Me\\" out. Congratulations, Sia on the attention you've recieved for that song alone, and Good Luck to you! Thank you Amazon, for letting me write a review.
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side Of The Moon is not your typical rock album. Like other Floyd work, the mood of the album is more slow pace, dreamy, dark and thought inspiring. Definitly not the type of album to listen to while jogging or speeding down the highway. No, this is the type of album which you must dedicate your full attention to. The lyrics are thought provoking and haunting. Also, unlike other albums DSOTM is not about the individual songs. The whole album takes the listener on a journey, each song blending wtih the next. The album begins with what is probably the greatest intro and ends with the best ending of any other album. The album is so absorbing that when the final track (eclipse) ends, it leaves you sad that the album is over... Just like you feel after watching a powerful film with a sentimental ending. Now purchase this album, turn off the lights in your room, lay back, crank up the volume, and experience a musical journey you will never forget.
B00007K02F|4.0|As someone who has both read the book and also watched 4 different adaptations at this point (this one, and the Samantha Morton, Timothy Dalton, and Welles/Fontaine versions), I can say definitively than none of them is genuinely \\"true\\" to the book.  But that should not be a surprise to anyone.  How do you take a book that is told in the first person, with Jane as our narrator, and expect things NOT to change the moment the camera forces you to the cool distance of third-person storytelling?  The Dalton version comes closest to a literal scene-by-scene reenactment, but it fails (in my opinion) largely because of the wooden performance of Zelah Clarke, who is the wall you see Timothy Dalton talking to.  And how true is it to the book to have Timothy Dalton simply sitting there staring, for what seems like an eternity, at the pivotal moment his \\"Jane\\" is purportedly bearing her soul to him? <br /> <br />This film, like the other three non-Dalton versions, strays far from the book's storyline in at least one significant way. (I know other reviewers seem to think the characters' heights and hair colors are \\"significant\\", but personally I mean only the highly altered St. John Rivers part of the story).  That story change is truly annoying just because it makes no sense--Jane wouldn't run away to Gateshead Hall, because it would be the first place Rochester would look for her.  But let's remember that Bronte's actual story also strains credulity here:  in the novel, Jane runs off to God-Knows-Where, and preposterously (though conveniently) ends up at her first cousins' house.   <br /> <br />We forgive the book for that, because the point of the book lies not there, but in its dealing with the interplay between love and the social code.  Morality and responsibility without love at worst results in Brocklehurst and Aunt Reed, and at best only in the cool proposals of Rivers that are based more on duty than on affection.  But (the story tells us) you can't just follow love without any regard for anything else, which is what Rochester would propose.  Jane's quest is to find love that does not conflict with virtue and duty, and the reason I like this film version is that I believe it best captures, in Jane's face, the perils of her quest.   The beauty of this version, despite its annoying St. John Rivers' variation, lies in the chemistry between the youthful Gainsbourg and the older William Hurt.  Of all the versions I've seen, this is the one where the performances come closest to evoking the characters' relationship in the novel, and the balancing act they play between their duties to others and society and their love and regard for each other.  Yes, there are departures, but the emotional core is there, every time Hurt and Gainsbourg appear together on the screen.  Fastforward through the Rivers portion if you must (and I do, sometimes) but don't pass this up just because of it.
1577311523|4.0|The \\"Power Of Now\\" provides concrete pointers,as Tolle calls them,to that level of awareness which at the present time evolutionary nature is leading us.He,together with many others, correctly states that it is imperative we make the necessary jump out of total identification with the mind generated self otherwise the the future for humanity on this planet is in doubt.His message is very clear and in presenting it in \\"The Power of Now\\" he also gives us direction towards that(THE NOW)which will bring about the change in conciousness.
B0001CCY7E|5.0|I am reduced to a blubbering fool listening to this. I remember seeing this in the theater way back in 1990 and realizing that the music I was listening to at that time was gutwrenching, endearing and lump in the throat forming. John Barry captured the feel of Dances With Wolves to a tee. What a breathtaking journey he takes us on through this soundtrack. I am a fool for not buying this music until 2005. I have watched my copy of the movie over the years and now have this CD. The John Dunbar theme touches my heartstrings like no other song. Amazing how music can touch the soul. If you don't have this in your collection, do order it. You will be transported to a world that no longer exists. Excellent!
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Savage Garden were difficult to categorize when they exploded from Down Under in 1997. Their melodies were rooted too much in adult contemporary to cater to the hipper teen listeners, yet they injected them with either a slick '80s dance floor feel or Euro-pop balladry to convince parents that they were another throw-away act. However they chose to be defined, there was something about their brand of sophisticated dance-pop that struck a nerve with audiences. Their self-titled debut sold bucketloads around the globe and spawned three massive hits, including the anthemic love song \\"Truly Madly Deeply\\" that shot them into the stratosphere in 1998. Three years later, they marched back with Affirmation. Just as they were previously out of place, their return at the dawn of the new millennium again found them caught in the midst of musical confusion. In '97, teen pop under the guise of the Spice Girls and Hanson was making its grand return, while a few pop-rock acts and female singer-songwriters (namely Jewel and Fiona Apple) and rap stars held down the bigger chart hits. When Affirmation was released in 2000, Britney Spears and *N Sync had released massive-selling sophomore records, and hip-hop was more influential than ever. Understandably so, Savage Garden didn't quite fit in, and yet they resembled everything that was great about adult pop. While Britney and the countless string of imitators were bumping and grinding to clunky, glitzy beats helmed by middle-aged Swedish men, the Garden boys portrayed their knack for insatiable melodies and lush productions. Despite being at odds with what was selling in the stores, they found themselves at the top of the charts yet again- the album's lead single \\"I Knew I Loved You\\" became the group's second No.1 in the US. It's somewhat sappy, certainly not anything edgy, but Affirmation is a solid offering from a group that were very well on their way to being the next Simon and Garfunkel in terms of a talented male duo churning out timeless, unoffensive, and altogether enchanting pop music.
B000065PUE|5.0|I realize that finally weighing in on `Doolittle' at this late date is sort of like speculating on who shot J. R., but I missed out the first time around. A college bloke in hardly unhip Austin, TX, I was plenty ripe for it, but I simply bought the wrong album -- with nothing to go on, I opted for `Surfer Rosa,' probably because of the great pair on the cover. But the dogmatically abrasive `Rosa' is not the place to start, and now a couple decades later I finally pick up `Doolittle' and learn I could have and should have loved the Pixies all along. <br /> <br />Ambitious but disciplined, the Pixies certainly don't make it easy on themselves: conjuring up both earthiness and clarity, they could make it on sound alone, but they're also constantly pushing their songcraft, piling great hooks on top of great hooks (I mean this literally). Their songs average about two and half minutes, even though tracks like \\"Hey\\" and \\"No. 13 Baby\\" show what they can do with a groove. Great grooves, by the way -- these hypnotic creatures could go on for half an hour apiece as far as I'm concerned. And I almost never detect them getting arty on us. Against all odds, they keep it fun.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Since this was the same price as the full screen edition, I went ahead and bought this 2-Disk edition. And it was definitely worth it. The second disk is pretty good, but not as long as I would have liked. (I think all those special extented Lord of the Rings dvds has spoiled me for good). While I was originally more of a fan of the actors and actresses involved in the movie and for the cinematography, I found the history of the play very interesting. The old footage of original rehearsals was a nice addition and the behind the scenes footage of the movie was good as well. I also like to know the original story behind a movie so I can see where the writers or directors made changes and why. This is one of those movies that gets better each time you watch it. Be sure to look for the easter egg on the second disk that has a cast and crew sing-a-long the \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\". It'll make you laugh. The only thing I would really have liked to see was a commentary on the movie. This is one of those movies that would have really been interesting to listen to the commentary on. <br />Finally, I have to add that while I am a big Gerry Butler fan and think he did an awsome job, Emmy Rossum was the shining star in this. Her reactions to the Phantom were so flawless and it didn't seem like she was acting at all. She had so much expression and wonder in her eyes. Great job!
B0009KA7BS|4.0|I thought this movie has an interesting concept and good special effects.  Keanu Reeves's weakness as an actor shines through a bit, but Rachel Weis is great and the plot is good enough even with him.
B000A7S4B0|5.0|BRMC is one of the great newer voices out there. <br />I don't know about you, but one of my favorite things is to hear a band evolve and to follow that evolution. <br />If you wanna' hear the same album over and over again...just play the old ones. <br />This is where they are now - deal with it - and be happy they're not just cashing the checks and phoning in their songs (like so very many bands do)...get with the program or be left behind.
B00008YJHC|5.0|Bosonova is a continuation of COP/Surfer Rosa and Doolittle. It has all the elements, ie rocking guitars, beautiful melodies, soulful croon/screaming aka Frank Black. She is just a little weirder  a touch tighter, and more mature.  <br />I am a different man than the teen who went to see the pixies at tt the bears in Cambridge in 1988, and I would expect the band to evolve as well. And they did. <br />This album takes several listens. After that yiu may only put Surfer Rosa on every once in a while. Doolittle will become an exercise in Gouge Away and Wave of Mutilation. Trompe le Monde will lie forgotten on the shelf. Death to the Pixies might still make sense, but you will constantly have to trade it out of your cd player with Bosonova. Dig for good music. Good music needs patience(Hear any Dizzy Gillespie lately?). Patience will get you to the Fire. Isn't fire weird? And ohh so Beautiful! <br />
B0001I55OC|3.0|This is not a great movie. But it is one of those movies i find myself plugging into the DVD player all the time. Despite it's weak points, it's still a fun movie with some great scenery. Especially Gerard Butler w/o a shirt!  ;)
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This is going to sound a bit too simplistic for some of you, but when compared with the original \\"Let it Be\\", some of the songs are better, some are worse, and some are about the same.  I do miss the banter in between songs.  At the time of the album's release in 1970, it was something that had never been done before, yet another first for the Beatles.  What is cool about the \\"Naked\\" version is that there are no overdubs, and you realize that even after not having performed live in three years, The Beatles still are amazing.  If anything, they are even better than they were when still actively performing.  Harrison has at this point become a better singer and guitarist, and I imagine the guitar improvement is partially due to becoming friends with Eric Clapton.  Lennon's singing, with the exception of his beautiful \\"Across the Universe\\", suffers from not being played with a bit by slick engineering.  \\"Don't Let Me Down,\\" due partially to the Lennon's mediocre singing, is not nearly as good as the version released as the flipside to \\"Get Back\\".  It was not on the original album, but was included here because it was recorded while the album was being made, and because it was part of the rooftop concert that was a highlight of the film \\"Let it Be\\".  McCartney's best singing with The Beatles came in their last four or five years, and \\"Let it Be Naked\\" proves this.  As usual, he has the variety thing going (although not to the extent of the White Album or Revolver), and he's spot on every song.  I think George Martin has commented that McCartney was such a great singer that very little was done in studio to alter it.  \\"I've Got a Feeling\\" is a great example.  Paul rips it up; John's little interlude is thin and uninspired. <br />In retrospect, perhaps Paul was too harsh in his judgments against Phil Spector:  Spector's version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\", which I've always liked, makes for a much better record.  In fact, if left bare as it is on the \\"Naked\\" version, it likely would have never been a single.  It is interesting as a way of documenting the early stages of a song. <br />Most pleasing and surprising is that the title track, perhaps the Beatles' best song ever, is even better here.  With the exception of the guitar solo, it has a bit more bite to it, and a nice live feel. <br />This is a must for a Beatles collector, but for a more casual fan, I would recommend the original.  In either case, this is one of the best rock albums ever.  How many albums are there out there that have songs as great as \\"Get Back\\", \\"The Long and Winding Road\\", and \\"Let it Be\\"?  Those are three of The Beatles' most successful songs, all Number Ones, and all on the same album.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I very much enjoyed the music on this CD, he's got a voice like Frank Sinatra, very seductive and peaceful at the same time.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I knew nothing of either \\"North and South\\" or Richard Armitage when I first sat down to watch this wonderful 4-part series. <br /> <br />But I sure did once I got up four hours later! <br /> <br />I knew that I'd discovered one of the best working actors I'd ever seen. <br /> <br />All of the other reviews have pretty much covered the overall excellence of the production itself, the other actors, the music, etc.  I just want to wax on about this amazing man who so totally infused John Thornton with his energy and talent. <br /> <br />Aside from his general \\"swoon-ability,\\" he never hit a misstep.  Every look, line delivery, and body movement was spot on!  From the first time he opened his mouth to scream, \\"STEPHENS!\\" at the top of his lungs to his soft, boyishly joyful \\"Coming home with me?\\" at the end, I simply couldn't take my eyes of him. <br /> <br />He's not handsome in a traditional way.  At first glance, I was rather dismissive of the much-heralded \\"Darcy\\" factor.  He looked autocratic, harsh featured, and snarly as he was seen through a cloud of cotton fluff surveying the workers in his cotton mill.  Two or three scenes later, when he smiled, I nearly fell onto my floor in a swoon.  And I am not particularly given to giddy swooning as a general rule. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the BBCA cut out nearly 14 minutes from each episode, so it wasn't until I watched the region 2 DVD that I bought from amazon.co.uk, that I saw some key missing scenes which explained the story development better.  And of course, included with the \\"goodies\\" is a post-production interview with RA himself. <br /> <br />I think that one of the main reasons that I enjoyed RA's portrayal so much was because he really brought a fully-developed male character to life in a Victorian drama.  So many times, the stories are told solely from the female aspect.  The viewer is left with only the brooding exterior of the male to watch.  This character of JT had such growth in his personal philosophy, his inter-personal relationships, as well as his professional dealings, and I found myself excited about sharing those growth steps with him. <br /> <br />By the end of Episode 4, I was torn between wanting to see some resolution between the lovebirds and wanting to stay with them on their endless search for an uninterrupted conversation with each other.  But, if it had to end...WOW!!!  What an ending!  It was the most romantic ending I could have desired.  It was so sweet and tender that I had tears in my eyes.  I probably looked a loony goon sitting there grinning at my TV but I didn't care.  And I still don't care each time I sit and sigh as they embrace.  The light feathery kisslings [made up word] elicit sighs even though I'm working on high double digit viewings of this DVD right now! <br /> <br />If you loved Colin Firth as \\"Mr Darcy\\" in \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" trust me you'll be ecstatic over the amount of screen time RA has as \\"JT\\" in \\"N&S.\\"  And what excellent use he makes of that screen time! <br /> <br />RA Rulez! <br /> <br />diane
B000005IRG|4.0|My uncle made me a tape of this record a while back, and i absolutly hated it! Then one day I was flipping through my music collection, and &quot;discovered&quot; this album. I put it on, and began to really notice the brilliance of the instrumental parts, and the jamming possiblities. This album is, more than anything, an excuse to have some good fun and jam for hours and hours. I couldn't name one single song that would encapsule the entire album, but &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; comes close. Altogether one of the best albums I've ever  heard without having even known the band existed beforehand. Highly recommended.
B000002ULO|3.0|McCartney has only written a few decent songs in the last thirty years, but on this album is his best in that span, \\"Calico Skies,\\" a true classic.  The rest of the album is over-rated although a few like \\"Song We were Singing\\" and \\"Beautiful Night\\" are listenable.  Don't believe all the five-star ratings and the gushing about this album- McCartney fans are just enraptured that he actually has a few songs on the album worth listening to- from anyone else, it would be a three-star album at best.  One great song, a few good ones, but over half are not that good and very forgettable.  For a McCartney album, it's better than most, but as most of us know, that's not saying much.
0895260131|5.0|Robert Spencer's title says it all.  This is not a politically correct book about Islam.  Spencer writes about the history of Islam that most Muslims wish outsiders never knew.  While the history is well documented with tons of end notes and is not hidden in Islamic nations, the politically correct media in the West doesn't want us to know the truth.  Thanks to Robert Spencer we now have a guide to the true history of this dangerous religion of Islam.<br /><br />A quick review of my own reviews will show that I am a deeply devoted disciple of Jesus Christ.  Almost all of my own reviews come from Christian books and Christian theology.  Being a disciple of Jesus, I am well aware of the differences between Christianity and Islam, between the Bible and the Koran, and between Jesus and Mohammed but reading this book brought a new perspective about the history of Islam.  To see Mohammed as he truly was is quite a shock to the Western mind.<br /><br />While President Bush and the US media tries to say that Islam is a religion of peace, by reading books such as this one will allow you to see through the smoke screen at the truth of this deadly religion.<br /><br />For more about Christianity and Islam see [...] as well as the book ANSWERING ISLAM by Norman Geisler.
0743490304|4.0|This is one of Dan Brown's efforts pre Da Vinci code. Yes, is unbelievable and far fetched, but so are his other books. And judging by reviews and sales everybody loves them.<br /><br />A fast read full of twists!.<br /><br />Read it!. You know you want to!
B00080ZG10|4.0|Although longer than most, it keeps you attention and interest throughout.  The costuming and scenery were in keeping with the story timeframe. The acting is supurb.  Very enjoyable.
B00005QK3W|1.0|This guy was a Beatle?  You'd never know it listening to this garbage.  \\"Flaming Pie\\" was a surprise hit with many people when it was released because it had a few good songs on it, unlike the typical McCartney album which usually has none.  Paul returns true to form with this disaster.  \\"Freedom\\" is one of the worst songs ever written.  \\"Your Loving Flame\\" is a half-baked love song which never gets off the ground.  \\"Driving Rain\\" is the epitome of dumb lyrics combined with a forgettable embarrassing tune.  Of all the four Beatles, Paul has had the most disappointing solo career.  In the 70's he sold well, but he has never had an album like \\"All Things Must Pass\\" and \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" that was withstood the test of time.  I know I was not expecting much, but I was hoping for better than this.
B0007DAZW8|3.0|I had hoped for something better than this.  Although all the tracks wanted--no, urged--you to hit the dance floor, I was somewhat disappointed by the whole album.  I did hear that they completed this in 6 weeks from another website (and other reviewers), and it sounds like they really did their \\"Homework.\\"  Sorry to say, this wasn't their best quality--or their best assignment, either.<br /><br />I actually did like their disco take on \\"Discovery,\\" and the catchy beats from \\"Homework\\"--no one else replicated their wacky but wonderful formula, so it worked out for the best--for them and us.  In \\"Human After All\\", I swear they held out on me when I listened to the tracks, and the experience left me saying, \\"That's all?  That's it?  It has to be a joke!\\"<br /><br />My patience was tested, especially when I heard \\"The Prime Time of Your Life\\" and \\"Steam Machine.\\"  My favorite songs? The title track, \\"Robot Rock,\\" \\"The Brainwasher,\\" and \\"Technologic\\", just because I downloaded it before I bought the album, thinking the rest of it was gonna be great, like \\"Technologic.\\"  The way I see it, I should've just stuck to that track alone because I actually like that song, and it was way cheaper than buying the album--a big mistake.  There were a couple more, but I haven't played it as much as I thought I would.  And for everytime I listened to it, it didn't make me like it any more than I did when I listened to it the first time.<br /><br />I do agree with one other reviewer though--you couldn't play this in the car, or anywhere else except for the club and your house.  It got way too annoying.  Way too repetitive.  If anything, you probably had to be high or drunk in order for you to really \\"get into it\\"--if it wasn't so darn repetitive.  The other songs on their other albums did too, but they added something more or less--a little less irony, maybe?  I hope their next effort eclipses this one!
0393316041|5.0|This book is composed of a series of anecdotes that were told by Feynman at one stage or another.  It is pretty messy although still readable. <br /> <br />That said this is a fantastic book.  It gives a wonderful insight into the mind of one of the greatest and most interesting scientists.   <br /> <br />This guy is what 'science' is all about.
0500512159|5.0|I own several sneaker books including SOLE PROVIDER and Bobbito Garcia's WHERE'D YOU GET THOSE (both of which I recommend) and I found this book to be a refreshing alternative. Written by the guys behind CROOKED TONGUES (which is a fantastic site by the way), this book is meant for the sneaker collector who appreciates the aesthetic qualities of a shoe, rather than for someone who only buys into the hype and player endorsement. For practically every sneaker that is showcased, at least one clear photo, brief history, and random fact dedicated to each shoe. I also appreciated the effort by the authors to distinguish original editions from reissues. In addition, the sneaker \\"dictionary\\" and collecting/cleaning tips sections are great as well.    One word of caution is that I would not recommend the book for those who are only into Air Jordans, or Dunks, or swear by only one sneaker brand. The book contains information for a variety of different models and brands, some which are more obscure. For example, I found myself skipping over some Vans, Reebok, and Diadora models. The authors also have more of preference for vintage running shoes as well. But if you have an open mind and an eclectic taste in sneakers, I recommend owning this book.
B00005NB0H|5.0|I own all three versions of The Who's \\"Live at Leeds\\" album.  This includes the original LP from 1970, the 1995 rerelease, and finally, the Deluxe Edition from 2001.  Others here have made references to the bootleg version, \\"Live at Leeds Complete.\\"  I do not own this, so I cannot judge if it is better or worse than the Deluxe Edition.  First off, let's get right down to the basics.  Much of The Who's live catalogue comes from material taken after one, or in some cases two, of their original members died.  Who's Last, Rocks America, Royal Albert Hall, Boston, the 2002 and '04 encore series.  Yes they are all good, but nothing can compare to the power and energy of The Who the way they originally were.  This is a great concert, now heard in its entirety (although somewhat out of order).  The sound is raw, fresh, and energetic.  \\"Young Man Blues\\" stands out, as does the heavily extended version of \\"My Generation.\\"  Then you get Tommy  on disc two.  After this performance it woundn't be much longer before the band quit playing it in its entirety.  If you are a Who fan, you owe it to yourself to check out this new release.
0553573403|5.0|Why is this book so good?<br /><br />There are a gillion reasons, so I'll try my best to just give you an idea of why you should read this book without repeating too much of what's already been said.<br /><br />Read this book if...<br /><br />...You enjoy deep, complex characters. There really isn't any 'evil' in this book. All that separates good guy/bad guy in this book is a difference in opinion... and, well, how far they'll go to get what they want. And some of them will go pretty far. This is no book where the antagonist gets little or no dialogue. Everyone gets their share of face time, which makes it SO much easier to love or hate any given character. There are no flat characters here, who have legendary power and a cool calm in the midst of danger. Everyone is human, and everyone brings and emotion to battle. That's one reason I loved a certain character to death in this book... there's all this lore about how many battles he's been in, and all the fierce enemies he's destroyed, but when you finally do see him in battle, he's not some stone-faced guy who's seen it all before. He brings a sort of lunatic-high to the battle. Everyone brings something to the table. There are no stone faces.<br /><br />...You enjoy exciting endings. And not just book endings, but chapter endings. All books claim cliffhangers after every chapter, but I've never read a book that delivered like this one.<br /><br />...You want to read a book with attention to detail - the RIGHT kind. So many books bore me with descriptions of time and place. This book has it where it needs it, and leaves it out where it doesn't. Martin's prose and flow is the best I've ever read. He avoids redundant description, and uses the perfect words to describe weapons and characters. Hardly ever does he use beaten-to-death phrases like 'so-and-so grinned,' or 'so-and-so held a blank stare.' It's fresh.<br /><br />...You want excellent battle description. Just as well as he makes his weapons cool with detail and history, he makes his battles alive with imagery. I'm reading Eye of the World by Robert Jordan right now, and I'm a little disapointed with the battle sequences (I'm 430-something pages in, so you have an idea)... I'm sure if I'd read it before A Game of Thrones I'd have no problem, but after reading through every aching second of hard-fought duels and frantic, even chaotic attacks in Martin's book, I can't really help myself.<br /><br />...You enjoy deep child and teenage characters. Ender's Game was my first novel. I LOVE that book. Martin writes his child and teenage characters just as well as Card wrote his adolescent heroes. In fact, the younger characters nearly steal the book entirely. They're just amazing. Super smart? No. Super gifted? No. They're cruel and kind in only the ways children can be.<br /><br />I could go on, but I've run out of time... I'm at a library. That's how good this book is. I have a time limit on my internet priviledges, and I'm spending it telling you to read this book.<br /><br />Read it. Love it.

B000002AGB|5.0|This album is a spectacular performance by the Who.  Energy, passion and fire are put into every song played.  This album is especially good for completists with songs like \\"Water\\" which never turned up on a studio Who record.  Also, unlike the Deluxe Edition of Leeds, this concert is presented all in order.  Tommy is in the middle of the set where it should be, instead of being placed on another disc.  This is a great performance, and any Who fan would be wise to pick it up.
B00003CXCD|5.0|This movie is the ancestor for most of todays fairytale like romace comedies but it, itself is not a fairy tale. It's very entertaining but a reality base movie and maybe that fact has made it that successfull. I think they could develope the story much more. the whole story happens in 24 hours. It was better if they made it more adventerous in more that one day! and I think they could although that 24 hours are good enough to rate this movie as 5 stars! <br />This is a must have DVD for a DVD collection and even for ordinary costumer it's a good choice cause most of them can watch it many time occasionally. But for collectors, I suggest to buy it as a part of \\"Audry Hepburn Collection\\" which cinsist of three feature films including Roman Holiday.
B00005JMJG|5.0|This is one of the better movies I have seen, that has come out in the past couple years, and was so good in fact, that I felt compelled to share my experiences of it. Being that it was a film by Charlie Kaufman, I expected a quirky, off-beat, and avant guard movie. In this respect, the viewer will not be disappointed (or disappointed, depending on the viewer!).<br /><br />But unlike movies such as \\"Adaptation\\" or \\"Being John Malkovich\\", although good movies, at times felt as if the movies were done for the sake of pushing all the cutting edge boundaries of film making and story telling for the sake of pushing the boundaries, rather than simply telling a good story and entertaining the viewer. In other words, it sometimes felt rather clich&eacute;d and contrived.<br /><br />In \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\", the artsy, film house effects and techniques work flawlessly well, because this time the story is focused, the characters are well developed, and very timely and universal themes are rather well played out. Speaking of themes, I felt a couple outstanding themes were developed in the movie and I would like this review to highlight them. Besides, many others have done an excellent job already of articulating the plot and character development (especially in Carey and Winslett), which I don't want to rehash.<br /><br />On that note, I felt these themes were particularly illuminating and quite poignantly done:<br /><br />1) Authenticity to ones self and loved ones: In the comical scene where Patrick (Elijah Wood) confesses to Frank (Thomas Jay Ryan) that he feel in love with Clementine and stole a pair of her panties during her memory erasure, we find that Patrick schemes to win the love of Clementine by confiscating all the love trinkets accumulated by Joel throughout his relationship with Clementine, and using those to induce feelings of love in her for him.<br /><br />This backfires of course, because those trinkets, love letters, and souvenirs were not gathered, given and exchanged in an authentic relationship such as Joel and Clementine had. Likewise, the main characters Joel and Clementine were not authentic to their own self and willing to face their feeling for each other, that cause them to separate painfully and facetiously attempt to erase each other by removing memories of each other though medical means.<br /><br />This was also exhibited nicely in a parallel story which occurred between the lead doctor Stan (Mark Rufallo) and Mary (Kristen Dunst). I thought these parallel subplots were nicely done to provide a comparison and contrast to the main characters and storyline and solidified the theme of authenticity.<br /><br />2) Memory \\"in search of lost time\\": Much like the protagonist's quest to recapture lost time thorough memory in Marcel Proust's most infamous and monumental novel \\"A la Recherch&eacute; du temps perdu\\" (translated usually as \\"Remembrance of Things Past\\"), we see a similar quest through the Jim Carrey character Joel.<br /><br />However disjointed and non-linear Joel's memories are narrated, the movie in fact portrays a sequence of chronological events in Joel's memory of his relationship to Clemetine, as they are being slowly erased. In my opinion, it is the way this movie unfolds these events that makes this movie a masterpiece.<br /><br />Proust's novel was influenced by a famous French philosopher of his time named Henri Bergson, who made a famous distinction between chronological time and psychological time. The former is constrained by the physics of constant forward motion with which we are powerless to escape, whereas the latter is flowing and dynamic manifestation of our complete inner world. It is one by which time neither goes forwards or backwards, but is one in which past, present and even our future (since our past and present for the most part dictate our future actions) synergizes by one of the most important abilities we have, which is memory.<br /><br />Thus, in the beginning of Joel's erasure and with the flames of anger and resentment still burning hot against Clementine, he mostly ruminates on the bad incidences and times he had with her. Such as the time, which from Joel we learn was the last time they met, was when Clementine came home late and drunk, and rather casually remarks \\"I kinda, sorta wreaked your car\\". Or the scene in the restaurant, where they looked like the kind of couple you feel sorry for, or the \\"dining dead\\". In these scenes, the memories are clear and the cinematic techniques are done such that we feel just as observers in a regular movie watching two couples in an end of a relationship.<br /><br />But as the movie progresses, the scenes become more disjointed and surreal, to the point where Clementine becomes Joel sidekick in his quest to thwart his memory erasure. And much like in real life, when we lose a dearly loved one or painfully broke up a loving relationship, the particulars of the memories we had of that other person starts to fade, but what we usually retain are the memories we want to keep. And as Proust and Bergson postulated, we \\"fill in the blanks\\" of our memories with our own interpretations and narrations.<br /><br />This was masterfully portrayed in the last of his memory scenes, when we learn that it was during a picnic at the beach where he first met Clementine. Though Joel is replaying the memory, he realizes it as so for he states, \\"it was so intimate, like we were already lovers\\". This process of rendering actual again what seemed lost, is exemplified when Clementine tells Joel, \\"this is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon. What do we do?\\"<br /><br />\\"Enjoy it\\", responds Joel. Through the multiple channels of memory can be evoked a complex series of emotions, revealing that through a step by step process, how sensory experiences can reawaken one's person past, which reveals how one's inner world can color and provide vibrancy to one's total experiences as a human being. And when that is lost, one's humanity is lost. Thus, when Clementine whispers \\"Meet me in Montauk\\" into Joel's ear in the final memory sequence, it was one of the most heartbreaking scenes, because you release he just lost a major part of his humanity, not to mention the lost of all the beautiful experiences he had with Clementine.<br /><br />As can be gathered, this is quite a complex and multi-layered movie that can be interpreted in many different ways, but does have upon reflection a core and universal theme about love, relationships, and how the mind works to assimilate and interpret them via memory. Though the movie is almost without flaw, I do feel the ending should not have been resolved so conveniently. As a Salon reviewer stated, the ending \\"was almost crushing\\", since \\"the risk of getting burned should have been left to us\\". I'm not so harsh about the ending, as I understand this was Hollywood produced movie, and no doubt the executives might have felt such a nihilistic ending would put off the large portion of the audience who were most likely seeking a dark and quirky comedy. Nevertheless, given that such a richly textured and deeply moving movie was actually produced out of Hollywood, should be enough to get you to view this rare gem and warrant repeat viewings. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />-Don Kimt Clementine, he mostly ruminates on the bad incidences and times he had with her.

Nevertheless, given that such a richly textured and deeply moving movie was actually produced out of Hollywood, should be enough to get you to view this rare gem and warrant repeat viewings. You will not be disappointed.    -Don Kim
B0006IIPIK|1.0|I've Ridden most of the reviews about this movie and I've got surprised cause I can't find even one positive point in this movie! This is difinately one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The worse move I've seen was Creature from the Haunted sea! Let's Talk about Negative points : <br />1. Actings were horrible! I may cause of that all of the scenes were computer graphic generated and actors couldn't feel later CG Environment around them <br />2. Montaging Actors in CG environment was extremely poor and actors were not seem as a part of environment but but some prominent motion beings in front it! <br />3. CGs were not sophisticated. nothing looked like natural and CGs inspired you to feel that you are watching a computer Game demo! <br />4. Story was extremely Ridicolous with no facts! I felt that the director of this movie was a child with huge budget who wants to bring to reality his childish dreams and games! If this movie had made in 50s, It could be acceptable but nowadays with Fact seeking people and Computer generation youth, making such ridicolous movies can consider as an insult! <br />5. I don't know what was the problem of directors with colors. this movie in full colors could be much more toloratable! It was not totally black and white and it was not in full color either! <br />6. I was a Dissapointing advertise for fallen British empire! I Don't know what was wrong with America that they Decided to Stick that flying air strips to Britain! Everyone knows without america, British couldn't sustain German attacks! Now they want to pretend that britain was always strong with super powers! I hate British and hate British accent more! Seem the British accent of Jude Law was not enough cause my favorite actress Angelina Jolie was trying to pretent that she was a British officer! <br /> <br />Don't let the trailer fools you! this movie even not worth to watch once. instead of it, I suggest you watching LXG, which has rather same storyline but 1000 times better than this freak!
B00000IPAX|1.0|At the time I am writing this, a whopping 1188 people have already posted reviews on Amazon for this album.  My review is not of the album itself but of the reviewers.  YOU ARE ALL CRAZY!  If you like the album you are definitely crazy.  If you are so bent out of shape about the album that you had to write a review, then you are even more crazy.  Luckily I am only reviewing the reviewers and not the album itself, therefore I am totally sane.  What a relief.  Cheers.
0670033375|1.0|Dr. Diamond is one of those academic sluts who come up with a theory before he ever bothers with observation or hypothesis.  So what you have here is a piece of pop culture pseudo science that a lot of people who know NOTHING about archeology, archeo-botany or climate theory are going to believe because this guy has a PhD. (You know what that PhD stands for?  Piled Higher and Deeper.  And in this case, it applies.) <br /> <br />He started this book with a point to prove, and then went out and found his \\"case studies\\" to fit his theory, entirely ignoring the little matter of the professional standard of scientific theory, which requires both observation and hypothesis AS A STARTING POINT.  Along the way, he entirely ignores whole libraries of both physical evidence and documentary information that disagree with his pre-determined viewpoint.   <br /> <br />His case studies--particularly the Easter Island one--are based in RACIST anthropological models that presume that the 'civilizations' in question were just plain stupid.  Of course, he being the Smart White Professor at the California University can help us avoid these poor, misguided, simpleton's mistakes, because, of course, we are White People.  <br /> <br />There's a reason that this book wasn't published by a University press--it could NEVER have gotten past peer review.  There are just too many assumptions, most of them false and racially biased, and there are reams of documentary evidence to prove him wrong.   <br /> <br />But peer-review standards and accurate scholarship don't mean anything to Viking, nor to the average eco-fan.  <br /> <br />The thing that really chaps me is that people are going to buy this thing, and because he can manage to string 2 sentencess together in a row, they're going to buy the argument, even though when all is said and done, the most CHARITABLE evaluation of it would be to call his interpretation a misrepresentation.   <br /> <br />Personally, I call it Lying By Omission.  Leave out the facts you don't like, pretend they don't exist, and you'll sell half a million books to people who don't have the background to know that you're only telling about 25% of the story.   <br /> <br />That's the real story of Diamond's book--how to hoodwink the eco-movement in 600 pages and make a million while you're at it.  <br /> <br />
B00005JNTX|4.0|Sin City is a visually striking film. It fully succeeds in capturing the feel of the graphic novel it is based on and of Film Noir in general. The acting is also good, within the limitations of the comic book-style chosen by the film-maker. The interlinked stories are well told. Some of the comments of previous reviewers are, however, puzzling. For example, in a film which is filled with eye-gouging, torture, mutilations, and amputations, not a few reviewers found time to comment on the \\"graphic nudity\\", which consisted of a couple of brief, shadowy shots of breasts. One aspect of American Culture I have always found puzzling is the propensity to view the most ghastly and sadistic forms of violence as \\"good wholesome entertainment\\" while a glimpse of an exposed nipple on television sends the whole nation into hysterics. Don't get me wrong, I love this country, but that is a bit of a paradox. A second odd comment I've seen concerns the supposed mysogyny of this film. Yes, most of the female characters are prostitutes, but the film is about the underbelly of society. Most of these women are portrayed as intelligent, strong, and perfectly capable of defending themselves. They are actually shown in a far more positive light than any of the male characters, who are almost universally portrayed as brutal, sadistic cavemen who are apparently obsessed with attacking other men's genitals. If anything, the film is more anti-male (mysandrous?) than mysogynistic.
0060763280|5.0|I feel this writing gets right to the core of what one must do to change their thinking in relation to limits, inner growth, and building wealth.  It is a must read!
B00007G1ZC|5.0|There was a kid who's momma wouldn't let him in the house and another one who talked to peaches. There was a soldier and a mountain climber and a demon. The chemicals killed everybody but the old man took his time and that is why he was so happy. It was a great movie but I couldn't understand what they were saying.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|It is rumoured that this film may get nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars, and it very well deserves it. I am 15 years old and have been a fan of The Batman for over 11 years. I could not forget that stunned and confused look on my face back in 1997 when I saw Batman & Robin. iwas the type of kid who enjoyed the two Burton films more than Schumacher's films in which back in those days kids enjoyed the last two more than the first two. After watching the slow downfall of the franchise in that film alone (especially when Robin was thrown into that green melted ice cream if you know what scene I mean) I thought that there was a very high chance that another film of Bob Kane and Bill Finger's character would not be made again. There were rumours in the coming years of a Batman Superman film and a Batman Beyond film, but both ideas flunked.  <br />So here I am almost eight years later watching a complete restart of the franchise and it is finally done absolutely right. Bale is by far the greatest portrayl of the character I have ever seen, EVER! Michael Cane is right on the money as Alfred Pennyworth and the supporting cast including Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Cillian Murphy and a lot more come together to create a most excellent film which doesn't even feel like a typical comic book film. This film goes along with Spider-Man 2 of films that show the story right. Buy this DVD!!
0596007124|5.0|The entire Head First series is the best thing to come along in a long time. This book is no exception. Thank you Head First authors!
0895260131|3.0|Whatever your background or beliefs one things is certain do not think this book will give you the answers about Islam and the west, it may for some be a useful starting point, for others it will confirm a bias.  <br /> <br />I would recommend reading the Koran first and then reading this afterwards, that way you will be able to truly understand and agree/disagree with the arguments contained in this book.  <br /> <br />Remember one book does not a library make.
1591396190|4.0|Similar conceptually to Christensen's The Innovator's Solution, which is the book I'd read if I could only read one. However, this is an easy read and it's popular. I know many who are or have read it. \\"Blue Ocean\\" for them has become a buzz word. However, blue oceans ulitmately become red oceans -- a point not addressed particularly well -- compelling business leaders to fight or flee -- another point not well-addressed.
B00007FOMP|5.0|Often referred to as the greatest soul album of all time, \\"What's Going On\\" was not only Gaye's magnum opus, it was also the most important record he had ever released. Needless to say, it was far different from the Motown hit machine of the time. Gaye went from R&B sex symbol to a true recording artist with the release of \\"What's Going On\\", and was rightly hailed as one of pop music's best and most important artists. There is a concept to the album. From the viewpoint of his brother Frankie, a Vietnam vet (returned in 1967), the phrase \\"What's Going On\\" was not only a question of a distraught soldier returning from war (there's a reason why their isn't a question mark), it was to educate the listener on urban deterioration, police brutality, drug addiction, poverty, riots, and abandoned children among many other topical concerns. These performances were among Gaye's  most creative and ambitious. \\"What's Going On\\", \\"Save the Children\\", \\"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)\\", \\"Right On\\", and \\"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)\\" are notable cuts, even though the album is best as a single listen. This is the first Soul/R&B album I've ever bought, and I cannot imagine a more perfect introduction to Gaye or the genre as a whole. Essential listening for any collection. Highly recommended.
B000AYEL1A|3.0|Book Bin's beautiful description of the \\"Evergreen\\" recording studio scene is dead on, except for one major error; this scene WAS infact recorded live.... no lip-synching here.  There is no bigger Streisand fan than I, but I must agree...this movie is just a mess.  I suspect the problem lies in the editing.  It's common knowledge that hundreds of hours are shot and then scaled down to make a 2 hour movie flow and make sense; it fails miserably.  You can't blame Barbra for the silly looking era, because as many here mentioned, this was the way of the funky and oh-so-tacky 70's, then considered chic` and glamorous.  The acting isn't bad, but it's hardly Oscar callibre either.  Hopefully the DVD will improve this mess or at least explain a few things.
B000002ADT|5.0|Often referred to as the best selling classic jazz album of all time, \\"Kind Of Blue\\" towers above Davis' peers on an epic level. This album simply set the standards for excellence, that no artist has ever been able to top. Why is it so perfect? I'm not 100% sure. Maybe it's because it never feels intimidating. Maybe because it captivates listeners by slowly inching it's way to instrumental highs and woes on a multitude of levels. The music is relaxed and easy to follow, yet it reveals more genius with each and every listen. Maybe because the music doesn't feel confined to a set of standard rules, because the whole set is improvised (per the liner notes by Bill Evans). Or maybe people come back to this record consistently, simply because it captures the most exceptional band in jazz history - Miles, Coltrane, Bill Evans, Cannonball Adderley, Paul Chambers, Jimmy Cobb. \\"Kind Of Blue\\" is the apex of tonal-jazz.<br /><br />I won't waste my time listing standout tracks, because I'd end up picking out the entire album. The fact that this music works as background and mood music, but also works on a level of close listening, is one of the reasons it's my favorite. Trust me, no jazz enthusiast is missing this album in their collection. It's simply the cornerstone of \\"any\\" jazz collection.

B000031EGV|4.0|We have this movie on VHS and ALWAYS loved it so when I seen it at Wal-Mart on DVD for $5.50 I HAD to buy it. This movie is a great adventure for the WHOLE family. I recommend it to everyone (even if you don't have kids).
B0001CCXY8|1.0|Its sad some people actullie except this as deathmetal but if you ask me?  cannibal corpse along with the whole stupid gore scene are nothing but talentless losers that cant get laid...the only kinda of people that write about  gore and violence are the same the  cant get laid that's why they are to angry.Anyways, its like this, you either enjoy great and talent music  that are played by real  musicians or you settle for this brainless and ignorent type of poser and low  deathmetal which to me is a disgrace. True deathmetal are these   bands ( i wont name them all) death, celtic frost,morbid angel,malevont creation,vader,cryptopsy,possesed, exodus( thrash metal but hey their amazing) , venom( thrash as well), well those are some bands that got talent unlike your mortician, cannibal  corpse,and all the other crappy gory crap that exist.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|I always have prefer Chris barnes deep gutturel vocals over fisher's but hey cc still brutalizy no mare what...Anywho,cannibal corpse's \\" the wretched spawn\\" is brilliant album with gore, brutality and great production. I recommend
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I did not get to see this show when it aired originally and I almost bought the DVD set 3 times just out of curiosity. It was not untill I saw the \\"Serenity\\" trailer did I order the set. <br />Unbelievable! Funny, serious, deep and at the same time light. <br />So close to real life and still be science fiction. <br />Lots of good acting and progression in the story. Makes you look at the \\"verse\\" in a new way. Who are the good guys? Depends on your point of view. <br />It's like asking, \\"Who is Shepherd Book?\\" That is a hard question to answer and one that needs to be explored just like this crew. <br />After watching the complete set, I find myself as hooked on this show as I was on Star Trek,Babylon5, or Star Wars. But in a strange way more so.  <br />Had the crew of Senerity been allowed to grow and mature, I feel quite sure we would be enjoying it today. <br /> <br />Serenity NOW! <br /> <br />
1400031001|5.0|I just finished this novel and I loved it.  A very interesting life, a novel in the form of a biography, told through the journals of the subject.  Brilliantly executed by W. Boyd, good work!<br /><br />When I was lent this book, I was told, it's good, it's hard to describe.  It is - both.  If you described the way the book is structured, I doubt I would have thought to pick it up.  I am having a hard time finding another novel to which I can compare \\"Any Human Heart.\\"  What I keep coming up with are travel/memoirs like, \\"Seven Years in Tibet,\\" \\"Arabian Sands,\\" or \\"One-Man Caravan.\\"  Or perhaps a biography like Eric Newby's, \\"A Traveler's Life.\\"  Mix in some Hemingway (\\"Green Hills of Africa\\") and some good history, (\\"A World Lit Only by Fire\\" or \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\")<br /><br />This is a wonderfully well-crafted book.  Boyd writes with assured clarity.  He evokes just the right mood and hits the flavor of many locations and social settings spot-on.  In many places, I re-read sentences or read paragraphs aloud to my wife, because the sentences were so perfect or the paragraphs were such wonderful distillations of place or human mood or stage of life.<br /><br />I love this novel.  I'm sure I will return to it in the future - a very rare thing for me with novels.
B000002NJS|5.0|I adore Madonna.  And I am proud to say that's this is my favroite Maddy album. Each song is well written and produced. What more could I ask for? To meet her! lol...but that will never happlen. Any way Here's the track by track: <br /> <br />1. Drowned World/Substitute For Love:  The 3rd UK single, but not released in the U.S. Why? Who knows. This is a fabulous ballad. Great lyrics. 10/10 <br /> <br />2. Swim: A great sort of rocky track about washing away sins and how bad the world is getting todday & how it can no longer be. Once again great craftspersonship by Madge & William Orbit. 10/10 <br /> <br />3. Ray Of Light: The sophomore single in the US & UK. A song made of the clubs. Very danceable. I don't think any Madonna fan hates this song. 10/10 <br /> <br />4. Candy Perfume Girl: Another rocky track. It's basically about a girl who's found her perfect match but the guy doesn't know it yet. Great metaphors used in this. 10/10 <br /> <br />5. Skin: I used to hate this song for three reasons. 1) It's long [6:23] 2) It's music is haunting. & 3) The lyrics [at least USED to be] difficult to interpret. These are all reasons I like it now. Another song about wanting a lover. 9/10 <br /> <br />6. Nothing Really Matters:  4th US single, 5th UK.This was also the final single in both countries. Fabulous song. It shows that really we need nothing bout love. Fabulous message & musically great. 10/10 <br /> <br />7. Sky Fits Heaven: I used to hate this too, because it sounded like Skin. But also like Skin, this song grew on me & now I love it. About accepting wise advice. Also about how things \\"fit\\" w/ other things & if you want to obtain the larger thing, you must first obtain the smaller thing, even if it's less satisfying. Also , to never let go of your dreams. 10/10 <br /> <br />8. Shanti/Ashtangi: As a practicer of yoga,  I like this song. I can even sing it! YAY! lol. It shows how much Maddyloves yoga. Genius. 10/10 <br />  <br />9. Frozen: Lead single in both countries. Fabulous ballad. It explains how you get nowhere by being self-centered. I've always loved this song. 10/10 <br /> <br />10. The Power Of Goodbye:  3rd Us, 4th UK single. I like this song ALOT. Madonna is sad because she loves a man but can't make him love her. It's a great song nonetheless. 10/10 <br /> <br />11. To Have And Not To Hold: About having everything you want & still not being satisfied. THis has the Yoga line: \\"Abahu Pukuru Sakaram.\\" I'm not sure what it means, but once I find out, I will edit this review & translate it. Anyway, this just  falls a little bit short with most of the songs. 8/10 <br /> <br />12. Little Star: About her daughter Lourdes \\"Lola\\" Ciccone-Leon. She is also telling Lola to never let go of her dreams & her true identity. Beautiful. 10/10 <br /> <br />13. Mer Girl: A song aboout death. Very eerie & scary. THe key board chords & absence of drums mak e this track especially haunting. 10/10 <br />  <br />Overall: 9/10 <br />
B00062ZE44|2.0|After their great success with \\"Mother Earth,\\" it seems that Within Temptation is struggling to find a niche in the music world.  I loved \\"Mother Earth\\" and its fusion of musical genres.  I eagerly anticipated the group's next CD.  I was disappointed in this newest release.  There are no songs that leave any lasting impression to speak of, and the songs tend to sound boring and repetitive after the first 3 cuts.  For those of you who loved \\"Mother Earth,\\" don't bother buying \\"Silent Force.\\"
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|The album has got a catchy beat.It's music that you can surf,sleep or dance to. It's mellow in some songs and fast paised like in \\"Jaqueline\\" and \\"Michael\\".\\"Jacqueline\\" starts off mellow then the guitar hits and it just takes off!\\"Take me Out\\" you can bop your head to, and \\"Tell Her\\" you can dance to.It's like...Beach Boys meets Interpol. These guys rock!Even live they're great!Some bands nowadays are really bad live, like The Foo Fighters and Good Charlotte.But these guys are great.So if you like beach like tunes, buy this.I highly recomend this.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Michael is the man, musical genious, legend, master, the ne messiah, treasure, diamond, golden feature and idol. <br /> This the best record ever made! <br /> Every song is made for real heart. <br /> This is better than Led Zeppelin's 4 or Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon
B0002858YS|4.0|It is poppy and catchy at the same time.It is like if you put Rooney and Franz Ferdinand in a blender and blend them together. I must admit, there are some songs that are boring but most of them are really great.I never get tired of hearing \\"Mr. Brightside\\" and I hear it all the time on the radio.I really enjoy most of this album.And I think you will too.
1400032717|5.0|This book is not really for the casual reader. This is not a book to take to the beach or read on the plane to pass the time. No this one requires thought and concentration and emotional participation.  <br />As told in first person from the mind of an autistic boy, we are gently caught on a thread of his story and pulled along through it, somehow understanding how he thinks. It is like those dreams where you are at once watching a person doing something and at the same time you are that person, amazing. <br />To be invited to participate in deciphering the tragedy of his chaotic dysfunctional family through his ordered and strictly structured mind is incredible. <br />I recommend this book to anyone wanting a vibrant experience of humanity and compassion. <br />Monty
B00004W221|5.0|A good film.  Inspiring to see what a person will go through to achieve his goals.
1400034779|5.0|This is probably the only series of novels about a female detective in Botswana, or, for that matter, any detective in Botswana.  But Alexander McCall Smith draws on the richness of that beautiful, special country whose air, sky and culture permeate every chapter.  This is a uniquely African story.<br /><br />Yet, Precious Ramotswe also is a darn good detective, drawing on her unique ability to understand human nature to solve a variety of cases.  Although you will not find the depth or convoluted plot of a typical detective novel here, Mma Ramotswe cleverly solves several cases.  Perhaps best of all, however, is that Smith draws Mma Ramotswe in detail, so that we know her life, her family, and a bit about her country.  Despite pain in her past, Mma Ramotswe leads a fulfilling life -- in size 22 dresses (and thank you for that, Mr. Smith)!  I look forward to reading additional books in this series.
B0002SROSQ|5.0|This is by far my favourite of Nick Cave's albums (well, technically it's two albums). Here, he seems to have consolidated everything that makes him great, and thrown it all in the pot. Frantic gospel songs (\\"Get ready for love\\") merge with spine chilling narrative songs (\\"Hiding all away\\") and hearteningly beautiful ballads (\\"Babe you turn me on\\"). <br /> <br />It's definitely an album where the songs themselves come to the fore - Cave seems to be growing even more as a songwriter with age. The lyrics are fabulous - funny, ironic, sincere, tragic, beautiful, loaded and evocative...sometimes simultaneously! That said, the Bad Seeds sound excellent. Pity about Blixa, but there's still plenty of personality in the music. Warren Ellis tries out a few different instruments besides his idiosyncratic violin, and the utilisation of gospel backing vocals is inspired. <br /> <br />\\"The Lyre of Orpheus\\" disc is mainly ballads, while the heavier one is \\"Abattoir Blues\\". I slightly prefer Abattoir - not necessarily because the songs are better (even though \\"There she goes my beautiful world\\" is I think my favourite Cave song ever), but because there's a bit more variety from song to song. Highly recommended.
0312932081|5.0|I'm not typically drawn to books/movies about war, etc.  This first book in the Ender's series was good and it interested me enough to move on to the rest of the series. Once I hit the second book however, I was amazed.  The rest of the series is beautifully crafted and the philosophies written are absolutely brilliant.  These books make one think in ways that many have probably never thought in.  By dealing with religion, space, races and extraterrestrial beings, this series helps us see past the invisible boundaries we place within our individual lives and our culture. Yes, the first book is really nothing great in and of itself, but it sets the stage for more than you can imagine.  It also introduces the character of Ender Wiggin.  If you cannot identify with him, it is because you are not meant to.  You see him as the others in Battle School do.  Now I am going to give too much away, so I will resist and say this series is one of the best I have ever read in any genre.
B000B5XOY8|4.0|Tim Burton pulled much from Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns to create the hard visuals for his Gotham City.  Frank Miller was the writer credited with darkening the hell out of the Dark Knight. In this film, Batman and the Joker are given almost equal screen time and have interlocking origins.  It was a very interesting concept and many actually prefer this origin for the Joker to the comic version where he's a nice stand up comic who gets involved with the mob but really doesn't want to. He's much better as a character who was always ready to terrorize. Many people who didn't pay attention to the film can come away with thinking the Joker has more screen time and that Batman doesn't get enough. These people obviously haven't paid attention: the Joker has more LINES because he's the Joker, Batman has less lines because Batman doesn't need to talk very much (see Batman Forever and Batman and Robin for good examples of what happens when Batman talks to much, you get crap). The film follows Batman/Bruce and we get to see how awkward it is for him to maintain basic human relationships as he tries to deal with his own baggage and save an entire city from the Joker's rampage. This is an excellent film from director Tim Burton, despite a lot of studio interferance like adding Prince, something Burton fought to get removed but, obviously, no dice. This film, like the Frank MIller comics he drew from, set a new tone for Batman in the public eye. A darker Batman.  Even though Nolan's Batman Begins was far closer to Batman's actual origins and demeanor fromt he comics, Burton's film is still very good as a sort of Elseworlds tale.
0802130208|2.0|John Kennedy Toole is a fine sophisticated writer of that there is no doubt. His turn of phrase is descriptive and vivid and his clarity of expression is a pleasure to read. His Pulitzer prize was earned and deserved in my opinion. However, sometimes humour and other charactistics of story telling, which is what this book definitely is, just don't cross borders. While I could appreciate the talent of the writer in an abstract manner, the story did nothing to entertain me. I was basically left unsatisfied and rather replused by much of the story, due, I am sure, to the inability of a non-american to relate to a very colloquial and private joke.
B000B5XOSO|4.0|Batman Returns features the best film dipiction of Gotham City to date. The city is grim, always dark, even during the day, old gothic spires stab at the sky.  This is Gotham the way it was intended: a dark pseudo 1800's looking city with a flare for 1940's decor.  In this film, Burton once again weaves Batman's story into the lives of his villians, shown through Bruce/Batman's relationship with Selina Kyle/Catwoman.  Burton did something most writers simply do not do: develop the villains.  We witness both Selina's tragic transformation to Catwoman, and the origins of the deformed Penguin.  In the comics, these characters were barely ever fleshed out, save for Frank Miller's Batman Year One, where he showed the beginnings of Catwoman as a dominatrix for hire, something to this day that DC would like to keep under the rug.  In this film, Batman and Catwoman have a tremendously complex relationship.  Batman this time around is far more in control of things, has a more streamlined and expanded batcave, and barely speaks while in the suit, all showing a more dead on version of Batman, the efficient strong, silent type hero.  A lot of people critiqued this film as \\"not a kids movie\\" but I always wonder, who says Batman is a kids character in the first place besides Adam West? The comics of Batman nowadays are no where near kid friendly, his villians are darker, more twisted, he's had side kicks brutally murdered, tortured to death, and crippled.  Not to mention that the whole story starts off with an eight year old boy's parents getting brutally murdered before his very eyes. yeah, shame on Burton for not making that all kid friendly... anyway, this film is an artistic masterpiece and set the tone for the aminated series which tried very hard to model itself after the Burton films, even going so far as to get the films composer, Danny Elfman, to do the cartoons theme.  Burton realized that Batman's villains should be just as messed up psychologically as he is, and as such, should be given equal screen time and character development, something they didn't really start doing in the comics until about eight years ago, in the late 90's.  Before that, they were just cardboard cut outs save for a few stories from Alan Moore and Frank Miller.  Batman Returns has a constant theme of wearing masks socially, persoanlly, and in all other aspects of life, Burton shows what happens when those masks are torn away and people are forced to face their own dark secrets.
B00000JGHL|4.0|A complicated story line.  John Cusack is new to me: a performance that only falters in the last stages of the film.  John Cobb (Austin, TX) has said in his review, \\"I am not a big Pacino fan, feeling he only plays one character well, and that one I'm way past tired\\".  I see what he means. <br /> <br />The set characters and set pieces - down to the set music - grow increasingly hollow to the point that you wonder if Pacino was intending to sound hollow.  <br /> <br />This film should not work yet by the end you have been drawn into it.  You have seen something not great but unusual and magnetic.  You watch the credits feeling sombre.  You hope that on one will talk to you for a while. <br /> <br />
B00005JNTX|5.0|This movie is very graphic and dark - themed, but it isn't one of those stupid action movies like Die Hard or Resident Evil (the games are much better than the movies). It's very artistic, with a lot of plot and story. There are 4 stories in this movie, and a few of them intersect. Anyone who is faint of heart should not watch this movie.
6304493681|5.0|OK... if there are 3 movies that id say are all time favourites in anime style I would say Akira, Ghost in the Shell and Princess Mononoko... The 3 have a singular essence in storytelling and digital art not folllowed (on personal opinion) by no other movies yet. <br />This particular movie has all the story of a 300 page or so manga compressed in almost 2 hours with no flaws in storytelling and follow up theme. A definite must in evry anime collector/appreciator/fan
B00003CXCT|5.0|In 1977, George Lucas began crafting a series of movies that would shape the way modern cinema was made for generations to come.  That series was none other than the 'Star Wars' saga, though he began his saga in 1977, the first movie was actually the middle chapter in a 6-part story.  After the success of \\"Star Wars - Episode 4: A New Hope\\" (then it was known only as \\"Star Wars\\"), George Lucas crafted the final 2 chapters in his epic space saga, \\"Star Wars - Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back\\" and \\"Star Wars - Episode 6: Return of the Jedi\\".  Upon completion of 'Episode 6', George took a hiatus from the grand universe he'd created, a hiatus that would last over 25 years, and would leave fans foaming at the mouth with anticipation.  During the mid-nineties there were rumors abound that George was working on the first 3 chapters of his space saga, a rumor that was further fueled by the 1997 theatrical re-release of the original trilogy with new CGI effects and scenes added in.  Finally in 1999, the time had arrived for the unveiling of the first chapter of the 'Star Wars' saga with, \\"Star Wars - Episode 1: The Phantom Menace\\".  Three years later he released \\"Star Wars - Episode 2: Attack of the Clones\\", and in 2005 George Lucas brought his series full circle with the much acclaimed, \\"Star Wars - Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith\\".  I have already reviewed the 3 films that comprise what is known as the prequel trilogy, and now it is time for me to finish my series of reviews based on the 'Star Wars' movies with my review of the box set of the original trilogy.  The following will be a synopsis of the basic plotline for each of the 3 films from the original trilogy, followed by the overall review of the box set.  If you are already familiar with the stories for this series, then feel free to skip the next 3 paragraphs, for those of you that may have been living under a stone for the last 25 years, continue reading the next 3 paragraphs. <br /> <br />\\"Star Wars - Episode 4:A New Hope\\" takes place approximately 16-20 years after the events of 'Episode 3'.  The galaxy is in turmoil under the iron fist rule of Emperor Palpatine and his Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Vader, who together are in complete control of the evil Empire.  Their are very few heroes left in the galaxy, with almost all of the Jedi exterminated during the 'Jedi Purge' that was perpetrated by Darth Vader, all that remains of the former glory of the Republic is a growing group of rebels that hope to one day bring down the evil reign of the Empire.  Assisting the Rebellion, led by an ambitious Princess from Alderaan, named Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), are an old man, who just so happens to be former Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, a young farm boy from Tatooine, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), and a space pirate named Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his Wookie companion, Chewbacca.  Together this rag-tag group of unlikely heroes hope to bring down the Empire's newest weapon, the planet destroying 'Death Star', and the key to this mission rests in the most unlikely of places, with that of 2 droids, C-3PO and R2-D2. <br /> <br />\\"Star Wars - Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back\\" picks up about 5 years after 'Episode 4'.  The 'Death Star' has been destroyed by Luke Skywalker, the Rebellion seemed to be on the upswing, but luck would not last forever, as the rebels have been forced to flee yet again to the ice planet of Hoth.  Luke and Han have become formidable pilots for the Rebellion, though Han and Chewie are looking to leave in order to pay off a bounty on Han's head, and Luke continues to strive to learn more about the Force, though his mentor and guide Obi-Wan Kenobi was killed at the hands of Darth Vader.  For Luke to learn what he must to become a Jedi, and assist the Rebellion in overthrowing the darkness that is ruling the galaxy, Obi-Wan appears as a 'Force Spirit' to Luke and instructs him to seek out an old Jedi Master named Yoda who has exiled himself to a swamp planetcalled Dagobah.  Will Luke be able to become the Jedi he is destined to be, or is it too late to hope for the galaxy? <br /> <br />\\"Star Wars - Episode 6: Return of the Jedi\\" takes place a few months after 'Episode 5', as Luke, Leia, Lando, and Chewbacca are planning to free their captured comrade Han Solo from his Carbonite prison and from the clutches of the vile, sluggish-gangster, Jabba the Hutt.  Once freed can Han and his friends in the Rebellion manage to destroy the currently under construction 'Death Star 2' that is being personally overseen by Darth Vader and his master, Emperor Palpatine.  Will Luke become a true Jedi Knight, and lead the galaxy out of it's darkness that has bound it for so long, or will he succumb to his anger, and embrace the legacy laid out by his father, Anakin Skywalker, by becoming a Dark Jedi?  The fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance. <br /> <br />The 'Star Wars' saga has been by far one of the most influential film series' ever created, and after viewing the entire 6-part saga all together, it really comes as no surprise.  With groundbreaking special effects, and leading the way from film to Digital media, the 'Star Wars' saga has paved the way for how many films are created today in this modern age of cinema.  The 'Star Wars' saga has something for everyone in the family to enjoy, from it's epic 6-part story, to it's awe-inspiring battles and space flights, with some comedy and romance thrown in for good measure.  This series is not one to be missed, and without a doubt is one of the greatest movie series' of all time! <br /> <br />\\"Star Wars - Episode 4: A New Hope\\" is rated PG for violence. <br />\\"Star Wars - Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back\\" is rated PG for violence. <br />\\"Star Wars - Episode 6: Return of the Jedi\\" is rated PG for violence.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Mr. Bungle.    <br /> <br />First, let me say that I do love SOAD.  However, I urge you at all costs to listen to Mr. Bungle's work from the 1990s and you will understand that SOAD is nothing more than a group of clever rip-off artists.   They stole the soul of Mr. Bungle, made the music a little more accessible (much heavier guitars) and radio-friendly, and there you have it.  To Serj's credit, he often speaks about Mr. Bungle vocalist Mike Patton as one of his major influences in interviews, but it doesn't change the fact that these guys have made millions ripping off a talented group who have hardly made a dime since they've been around.   At least give them an opening slot on your tour, you greedy slime!
006072448X|5.0|There are so many layers to this searing, breathtaking novel that it keeps overwhelming you anew, days after you've finished the last page.  Of the author's many, many strokes of genius, the most moving for me is her narrator's artful, formal, and vaguely false use of language--the only thing she has left to shield herself from the raw pain of her tragedy.  Unforgettable.
B0002858YS|1.0|I hate this band, There disco rock, Go listen to Kanye west Or The Beatles, Cuz there lameo disco rock. There lameo :(
B00005QDW5|5.0|Ok the only way a true PF fan will ever accept anything as a greatest hits will be if they run every single album together without cutting a single track.  This compilation album gives one a taste of all of PF's music from their beginning to their current status.  One can only pray that there will be future additions and they will come back for the better hood of the music world.  Then the kids of today can actually here what music is supposed to be like.
B000929AJQ|1.0|Thats what this album is. Miss Bianca Of The Rescue Aid Socity was right saying there lame, Cuz there as lame as lame gets. Man is this CD lame, And old news. The Beatles are WAY!!!! better them old boring Nine Inch Nails.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the O.C., and I have to disagree with reviewers who say the first season was better. They are both great! The continuation of the witty, humorous and also dramatic stories are a great follow-up to season 1. I actually think the 2nd season got even funnier. <br /> <br />The characters continue to be great, although there's the introduction of a few new ones which obviously failed, because by the end of the season, they are all gone. (Except for Alex, bring her back!) <br /> <br />It's definitely worth a spot in your DVD collection! <br />
B0002XDODU|5.0|If I could give this album 10 stars, I would!  I particularly enjoyed the satires between Amerika and Moskau.  Reise, Reise it's an adrenaline rush!  This is a great unofficial translated website of Rammstein's songs. [...] No fan should be without.
068987474X|3.0|I thought this book was a fun read, but definitely overrated and not well-researched.  It seemed to be written by 2 friends who just thought they had great advice to give to people so decided to write a book. <br /> <br />I find it very similar to \\"The Rules\\", and that whole phenomenon about how to act around men, and how it should be.  I agree with some points this book made, but these kinds of things should never be followed 100% of the time.  They make love and relationships sound concrete, so black and white, when relationships are the exact opposite of that. <br /> <br />Again, a fun read, but don't shell (too much) money for it, nor should you expect any enlightenment from it about guys. We as women wil never figure it out!
B000006O7C|4.0|Jeff Buckley, perhaps the most talented singer of his generation, never finished his second album.  Tentatively titled \\"My Sweetheart the Drunk\\", Buckley had recorded an album's worth of material with producer Tom Verlaine before deciding he was unhappy with it and headed to Memphis to work up some demos.  While in Memphis, Buckley drowned in a swimming accident and would never complete the album.  As time has passed, his estate (run primarily by his mother Mary Guibert) decided to release the recordings he had been working on-- with the verlaine sessions on one CD and the followup work on another.  No attempt at retroactively completing them was done, and as such, the material (particularly the second disc) has a somewhat rough feel to it.  As it is incomplete, the release was titled \\"Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk\\". <br /> <br />Listening to the Verlaine sessions, the choice to abandon them makes little sense.  Admittedly, it's not quite as good as \\"Grace\\", but it's not done either, and it is awfully good as is.  It feels like a sort of less bombastic version of \\"Grace\\", with Buckley exploring his mid-range tenor in more detail and experimenting in vocal harmonies and jangly guitar parts.  The music explores a soul sound (\\"Everybody Here Wants You\\", with one of the best falsetto deliveries Buckley ever did), Buckley's lower register (\\"Nightmares By the Sea\\"), alt-rock (\\"Yard of BLonde Girls\\") and the most avant-garde work Buckley ever did (the unclassifiably brilliant \\"New Year's Prayer\\").  And quite frankly, there's not a bad track on the disc. <br /> <br />The second disc finds Buckley searching-- be it for a musical direction or a vocal range to sing in-- check fractured avant-garde blues \\"Demon John\\" for examples of both.  Buckley sings in as low a register as he ever has over a bizarre, churning alternative riff that hints at psychedelia and blues and noise and really is uncategorizably his own.  Likewise, his superb cover of Genesis' \\"Back in N.Y.C.\\" is something to hear-- running arhythmically and feeling more like a free association than a song, it somehow works magnificently.  And while other cuts aren't quite as successfull (most notably psychedelic dirge \\"Murder Suicide Meteor Slave\\"), certainly the material is intriguing, and one wonders where it would have ended up. <br /> <br />The liner notes contain two essays-- one by Bill Flanagan describing the context into which these recordings were both recorded and released, and one by  Mary Guibert talking of her decision to release these. <br /> <br />In all, it's a good recording, it's not \\"Grace\\", it's not complete enough to be \\"Grace\\", and it feels like a love letter to the fans rather than a real release.  Newcomers to Buckley should start with \\"Grace\\", the initiated will want this as well.
0312263120|1.0|Hey Brown!!!!!(Marrn in spanish, really ugly color) <br /> <br />First, I put one star because I have to put something <br /> <br />How are you??? <br /> <br />Well, I'm gonna to introduce myself, I'm a seventeen year old kid, and, I'm from Spain, Valencia. I've been two times in the US (I can't say America, there's to many countries in America, from Argentina to Canada, to many). The first time I was in the US, I was in Maryland, great state, I was for a month, I used that time to be in Washington D.C., New York, and a few states, I really enjoyed it. After that, this last year, I was a foreign exchange student......yep, I was in California, I was in Vegas, Phoenix, the dessert, Los Angeles, I was in a highschool, great teachers and bad teachers, like everywhere. <br /> <br />I found your book, how to say, an insult to my country, I was really upset (when I was done with the book, I wanted to use it in my fire place, because that wasn't worth to keep). I foundtotally depressing what you said  about Seville, I love my city Valencia, but I thought that even the most sense less politic can say that Sevilla it's a really happy, enjoyable and beautifull city, but it seems that is too hard for you to judge that, I'm gonna tell you something, the 20% of the population in the US is poor, living in really bad conditions, thats the population of my country. Look, I have so many things to tell you that I will like to have an interview with you Mr. Brown, Me Mr. xxxx  I invite you to come to my country, you can contact this way, or on other reviews, I just want to tell you that to judge something, somebody, a country, an action, whatever, first you have to judge you country, your people, your actions and your behavior, then you know really good what are you going to judge, then, you can write a story of lies if you want to. Thank you very much for your time, I invite you again to my country, If I had the money I'll pay the plane and all the spends. <br /> <br /> <br />A message from my mother (she wanted in spanish): <br /> <br />  -He leido el Codigo Da Vinci, cuando comprobe que muchos de sus datos historicos eran erroneos pense que sencillamente pretendia contar un cuento relativamente bien escrito, despues de enterarme de su ultima publicacion, la cual me parece ofensiva, no solo para espanoles, sino para toda europa, le digo que como profesional de la sanidad, de este pais, estamos operando a diario alemanes, ingleses, suizos, belgas, holandeses, etc... que han decidido vivir en nuestro pais dado su clima y fijese usted que no vuelven a su pais para sanarse, sino que prefieren ser curados en nuestra sanidad publica, es usted un impresentable mentiroso.
B0002S94BG|5.0|Jeff Buckley's \\"Grace\\" is one of those albums. One of those life-changing records that the first time you hear it (and I mean REALLY hear it-- it took me over ten years to really hear it), you stop what you're doing, no matter what, and you just listen. And somehow, when its done, you start it over again and it feels like everything's changed. <br /> <br />Buckley, who died at a young age after recording only one studio album (this one), has left a legacy with us. Showing signs of his pedigree in downtown New York, his music has that sort of unnamed quality you can't quite pin down. Simple folk songs or delicate blues somehow become quite a bit more. It could be Buckley's voice, a high tenor that feels a bit like a non-tempered instrument, is certainly evocative and filled with emotion. It could be the subtlety of the arrangements. It could be something else entirely. <br /> <br />The point is, its there, and the music really is transcendent. To single out any particular track is a bit unfair, its pretty much all unbelievably good, from blues-based rock (\\"Mojo Pin\\", \\"Eternal Life\\") to ballads (\\"Hallelujah\\", \\"Lilac Wine\\", \\"Corpus Christi Carol\\") and some material that just defies even such broad categories (\\"Last Goodbye\\", \\"So Real\\"). But really, star to finish, a superb record. <br /> <br />The Legacy Edition has been newly remastered, admittedly probably somewhat unnecessary given that the album is only a decade or so old, but noentheless the sound is crisp and clean.  The bonus disc includes a dozen or so tracks, b-sides, alternate versions, and so on.  The material isn't quite as essential as the album, but it's all awfully good, and certainly several of the tracks are as strong as the material on \\"Grace\\" (\\"Forget Her\\", \\"Mama, You Been on My Mind\\").  The set also contains a DVD with a \\"Making of Grace\\" documentary filmed in the '90s and updated for this set that is quite an interesting watch and runs about 30 minutes long.  Buckley's band in particular is a treatto hear interviewed.  The disc is also augmented by the videos for the album's singles.  Finally, the liner notes contain commentary about all the bonus tracks by producer Steve Berkowitz and Mary Guibert (Jeff Buckley's mother) and a brief essay on \\"A Decade of Grace\\" by Bill Flanagan.  All of this comes wrapped in a giant digipack and a plastic slipcase.  All in all, it looks quite nice (and it matches \\"Live at Sin-E\\" well too-- now if only \\"My Sweetheart the Drunk\\" would get this treatment!). <br /> <br />All in all, this is one great value, and a nice way at looking at the legacy of what really is one of the best albums of its decade.  Highly recommended.
0895260131|1.0|Beyond just being an attack on Islam as a religion, this book attempts to rehabilitate the crusades into something wonderful.  As such its worth reviewing some parts of the crusades.<br /><br />The first crusade ended at Jerusalem with the extermination: men, women and children of all the muslims of the city.  As for the Jewish population, they took shelter in the main synagogue.  The Crusaders deliberately set fire to the building and rather deliberately set about burning every person inside.  The crusades also left a trail of dead jews in their wake all the way from Germany to Jerusalem.  Contrary to the book, there is nothing good that can be said about the crusades and a whole lot wrong that left unsaid by the book.<br /><br />In the later crusades, far more christians were killed than muslims by the crusaders.  They destroyed christian cities, set up kingdoms over christians and wrecked churches.  As today, it wasn't enough to be christian, you had to be the right kind of christian or you were as likely to be killed as jews or muslims.<br /><br />Anyone who claims to have a graduate degree in middle east history should know these facts.  Any book that tells christians that the crusades were good is as anti-jewish as it is anti-muslim.
0812550706|5.0|Not everybody was a genius growing up. I certainly wasn't. But most people can remember a time in their lives where they didn't really fit in, and this story fully captivates that thought. Andrew is brilliant, he's loved by almost everybody, but his gifts make him an outcast.  <br /> <br />This is my absolute favorite book I've ever read. I don't particularly like Sci-Fi books, but this one is different. I've made a lot of my friends read this book, and I've noticed that (not to stereotype) guys tend to like this book better than girls. I think we have a bit of a superhero complex in that we feel we could be that one saving the world--and this story is just that. Andrew Wiggin has to save the world, and he's just six years old. It's not that girls can't appreciate this book, it's just that guys are built in such a way that, after reading the book they sit back and say, \\"I could do that.\\" <br /> <br />Some people have said that this book is too graphic, too violent, and yet it really wasn't. It was violent, sure, but not bloody or gorey. Andrew had to defend himself a couple of times, and he did so well. He didn't cut people up with a samurai sword, or anything like that, but rather had to use quick thinking and speed to get himself out of difficult situations. The language in this book was not extreme by any means. Someone even said that it was sexually explicit, but I can't imigine how, as they're prepubescent kids. <br /> <br />This book is one hundred percent made for the person with the hero complex; for the person who would love the chance to pick up a sword and stop the forces of evil. Card shows a lot of insight into how people work, especially children. In a way, it's rather sad, as there's not a whole lot of happiness in this story. Just a bunch of kids who have a job to do, and Ender overcoming every challenge put before him. Overall, it's a wonderful book to read. <br /> <br />As a side note, I've also read the rest of the books in the series, and although they are great books, they're not very similar to Ender's Game. It seems like Ender's Game was written with a large audience in mind, whereas the rest in the series are much more Sci-Fi oriented. Good books, just much different in tone than Ender's Game. <br /> <br />

I drove my co-worker's crazy by playing your second album A Rush of Blood to the Head over and over.<br /><br />I never thought I'd like a song more than In My Place, Clocks and The Scientist from your 2nd album but Fix You goes straight to my heart. The more I listen to the lyrics and the touching way it's sung the more I get choked up.<br /><br />Yes, ColdPlay, you had me from \\"Yellow.\\"  And you still have me after the last note is sung on X&Y.

B000059QYB|4.0|During the 80's, Billy Idol was a commercial force to be reckoned with, releasing a series of tracks that seemed to fit in perfectly with the New-Wave & Album Rock radio orientated tracks, that seemed to make up a large part of the commercial music charts.  Mixing a punk attitude with the catchy hooks of rock, and the accessibility of Pop, he had a series of singles that frequently entered the singles chart in the U.S. (with some small success in the U.K.), and such was his ubiquity, that several tracks made their way onto a fair few American 80's films, and music compilations. <br /> <br />His was a sound that successfully mixed a confident swagger, with the rowdy and brash bravado of his more Punk-rock orientated tracks (\\"Rebel Yell\\", \\"Mony Mony\\"), alongside more theatrical and stylish New Wave/Pop crossover songs (\\"Dancing with Myself\\", \\"Sweet Sixteen\\", \\"Hot in the City\\"), and always clever enough to remember that at least one anthemic ballad should be included on every album (\\"White Wedding\\", \\"Eyes Without a Face\\").  And as the record companies have noticed that the new current bands these days, are frequently referencing 80's music in their songs, (or indeed 80's act's rejoining), that the timing is perfect for a compilation that highlights the best tracks from one of the 80's biggest hitters.  <br /> <br />Billy Idol's career didn't really revolve around albums, (he wasnt much of a album artist), and instead, was a much more potent force as a singles artist.  And it's here that the compilation purely concentrates on, offering a short, sharp & sweet culmination of his career, in a compilation that pretty much includes all the essential singles, that document his career.  And Unlike a lot of the other 80's artists that you may have had a fondness for, Billy's music has dated incredibly well.  For proof of this, stick on \\"Hot in the City\\", \\"Eyes Without a Face\\" or \\"Dancing with myself\\" to hear a sound that is quite clearly 80's in sound and instrumentation, yet still has that emotional attachment/connection that it had the first time around.  Maybe this is due to the fact that some of these singles are still in rotation to some degree, in various forms of media/Music.  And so, maybe this means that we never truly got a chance to forget about them???  But what is clear, is that when listened to, they still contain the rebellious nature and appealing blend of pop hooks, punk attitude and rock bluster to hit all the right buttons.  And thankfully some care has been taken with the compiling of this compilation, as unless you are a die-hard fan, there isn't really anything noticeably missing here.  There is an live acoustic version of \\"Rebel Yell\\" on the last half of the album, and although it'll never replace the studio version (also on this disk), shows that Billy could deliver the goods, Live.  (although it probably would have worked better, being stuck as the last track on the compilation, rather than second from last).  And my only real compliant would be that one of my favourite tracks \\"Don't you (Forget about me)\\", is a newly recorded version. Why???.....the original was utterly sublime, and although this new recorded version is still excellent, you can hear that it's ever so slightly more uptempo than the original, and remains slightly inferior to the original version. <br /> <br />But that is a small point, and its surprising, just how well his works stands up, after digging this superb compilation out and listening to it, some 4 years since the last time it heard it.  If you (Like me), just want a compilation of all the hits without having to dip into the studio albums, you really should make this the only Billy Idol purchase you'll need.  It is arguably the finest of the small amount of compilations that have been released for him, and will completely satisfy anyone, either new to, or looking to revisit his work.  highly recommended!!!
B00003W8NM|5.0|From the opening sequence traveling through the inner workings of Edward Norton's neural system it's clear that director David Fincher wants to assault your senses with 'Fight Club'. He throws in everything including a few kitchen sinks so that by the end of his film you'll want to take the ride again. He doesn't care that some aspects don't quite make that much sense or that the main character Tyler Durden has a viewpoint that some would call fasscist. He wants you to think about 'Fight Club'...but not until the last (and very vivid) frame is over. <br /> <br />Edward Norton plays Jack - a depressed business man stuck in a nine to five job and hating every second of his miserable existance. So much so that he cannot sleep a wink. He stumbles into the world of support groups (namely testicular cancer) and begins to feel better about himself; he is finally able to sleep. That is until a chain-smoking, pill-popper Marla comes in with the same plan of crashing support groups. His lie reflects his lie. After meeting an eccentric soap salesman by the name of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) the two decide to unleash their aggrevation with the world by beating each other up - and loving it. <br /> <br />From the opening scene Fight Club is full of ideas and principles and logic. Half-way through many of those ideas have either meshed together to form something greater or collided with a bang/thud - and still formed something more substantial. By the end of the film we're in chaos. The ideas still make sense but we're so immersed in the story of Jack and Tyler that we can't stop and think about all this logic. This is not a bad thing. In fact, it's a great thing.  <br /> <br />By the second half of the film you are no longer allowed to have a breath of fresh air. There are no moments of release where you will think that one character is going to be okay. David Fincher hands over the controls to Tyler Durden and we strap ourselves in.  <br /> <br />Fight Club is brilliant and the critics never gave it the respect it deserved. Not only is the film full of ideas, but it's extremely well acted by the entire cast, offers some breathtaking imagery (much of which is CGI but rarely noticeable), and startling and frank scenes of violence and uncontrolled mayhem. In many films that would be a detractor; Fight Club goes overboard with every element but at the same time manages to pull it off perfectly. Kudos to David Fincher for assaulting us - nobody could have done it so well.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|The soundtrack to this musical is absolutly amazing.  Though it does not feature the current broadway cast, I've personally found that I enjoy the original just that much more.
B00005OMTT|5.0|Ah. Enigma. Savor the word. Feel it flow off your tongue. Rarely does a musician choose such a captivating alias, yet alone one that so perfectly describes the intricate music laying underneath. With this greatest hits release Love Sensuality Devotion we are taken into the mysterious world of Michael Cretu, via 18 sensational tracks laced with beauty and rinsed in atmosphere. Think of a beautiful painting, the kind that forces you to stare for minutes on end. Now imagine this painting being transformed into a song, and you should have some sort of idea as what to expect from this mastermind. Mixing dancepop beats with Gregorian chants, a diverse range of synths, and gorgeous female vocals placed here and there, Cretu never hides his love for artistic experimentation - which makes Enigma's success all the more interesting, given all the tasteless musical trends that have emerged over the past decade and a half. Perhaps it's that such hits as \\"Return to Innocence\\" and \\"Sadeness Pt. 1\\" are just so darn addictive. Who knows? But why complain?  <br /> <br />Production-wise, the album fails on no level. It is obvious which songs have been remastered and which have been left untampered with, but they all sound great in the long run. From the calm tenderness of \\"Shadows in Silence\\" to the catchy atmo-synth of \\"TNT for the Brain\\", you will be left speechlessly dazed and entranced (especially after multiple listens, which are required for full musical comprehension). Other hits like the epic \\"I Love You...I'll Kill You\\" complete with blaring guitars, or the infectious \\"Turn Around\\" - a song exclusively written for this record - are also essentials. My personal favorite track is number 3, \\"Gravity of Love\\", fronted by angelic female singing, rounded out by an ethereal chorus and some rather enchanting operatic vocals. Actually, since there are no weak tracks to be found, the album flows pretty darn well too - a big plus in my book, especially for \\"best of\\" releases which are often muddled by poor organization.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, LSD is an essential, comprised of pure new age classics, fit for any and all CD collections built on the foundation of good music (aka music with substance). Don't let yourself miss out on such an incredible masterpiece - you'd only be mistreating yourself. Don't believe me? Well, I'll sum this CD up in three words - find, grab, buy!  <br /> <br />10/10 <br /> <br />[Originally written August 1, 2005]
B000002MFN|5.0|<br /> <br />When Erotica was released back in 1992, I ignored the album thinking Madonna had lost her golden touch. Then I purchased the cd a few years later and still wasn't impressed. But now, I am older (and wiser), I grown to not only love but appreciate Madonna's honestly when it comes to life and love. Like most people on here have stated, this cd is not about sex. There are only two songs that reflect this, but Madonna sings about sex in such an imaginative and creative way, you don't feel nasty about it. You feel like someone told the truth on a subject most Americans are too embarrassed to discuss or to be honest about and as a result, this will probably go down as Madonna's most underrated work. Janet Jackson went this route AFTER Madonna made it a success and even Madonna considers this album to be one of the best two albums of her career. My favorite songs are: <br />Erotica-I never understood what the big deal about this song was. Many people have erotic fantasies about sex. The song subject is backed pounding and dark club beat. <br />Fever- Madonna does a great job in covering this song. <br />Bye Bye Baby- I loved this song the first moment I heard it, but I hated the ending (now I love it). The song has a hip pop beat. <br />Deeper and Deeper- an instant classic. Although Madonna attempted to celebrate the 70s with this song, she actually created a sound that transcends time/era. <br />Where Life Begins- love this song and I love Madonna \\"wink wink\\" lyrics. The song is backed with a jazzy feel that's romantic. <br />Bad Girl- one of Madonna's greatest ballads. I often wondered if the song is about her because the lyrics sound so personal. <br />Waiting- this song should have been a single, although it's not radio friendly at all. Madonna mostly talks in this song about waiting for love and she is backed by  <br />Secret Garden- I never try to fully understand what Madonna is talking about in her songs, but I think there is a reason why she let this song be the last song on this very dark album. I feel the song offers hope. It offers a chance to feel what love and sex should be about, romance, and to find partnership with someone of the same mind and maybe start a family. Madonna is backed by 60s style jazz. <br />It's a shame people still ignore this music that was so ahead of it's time. Maybe her upcoming cd will bring more awareness to this collection. <br />
0930289528|2.0|Cliche, predictable, lifeless and boring are just the obvious adjectives that come to mind when I think of V for Vendetta. Maybe it wouldn't seem so dull had 1984 never been written. In that case I might find it more inspiring and exciting. But the fact that Orwell was such a master of his craft and painted a much more intriguing vision of a totalitarian future than Moore could accomplish even with the aid of actual illustration just makes V look childish. <br /> <br />I had heard nothing but praise for this book, and was utterly disappointed. I've been reading that the movie version (the trailer for which is what sparked my interest to begin with) is not all too faithful to the actual comic, and I can only hope that this is true. Hopefully the Wachowski brothers re-vamped and pumped some much-needed life into this story. <br /> <br />If you really want to read a comic that contains a brilliant and truly thoughtful story, I suggest either of Frank Miller's masterpieces Batman: The Dark Knight Returns or Batman: Year One.
B000000OE7|5.0|I have to say one thing. Freddie Mercury deserves the most respect out of anyone in the world. This is a sad album, but it makes me feel good that Freddie went peacefully. Because of his excellent voice and success, he deserves to go peacefully. \\"Let Me Live\\" and \\"Made In Heaven\\" are 2 songs that make me tear. Freddie, I hope God is taking care of you in Heaven, and that you are having a great time in heaven. I'll see you up there when I die. That probably won't be for a while.. heh..
B000002JS6|4.0|I think I'll give this CD 4 stars because I like all four songs.<br /><br />Hells Bells, Shoot to Thrill, You Shook Me, and Have a Drink on<br /><br />Me. Better together with Highway to Hell, and AC/DC Live.
0446677450|1.0|Nice generalities, nothing else.  If anything, I admire how the author generated a huge buzz about his books.  He does know how to make a fortune, and he&#8217;s not about to give away his trade.  You&#8217;d probably learn more watching his book sales than reading them. <br />
B000002H97|3.0|I think this is good but In my opinion, Metallica needs a compilation but with my top ten song, Enter Sandman. But I really<br />don't know a lot of their songs, thanks.
B000059MEK|1.0|Interesting that the two French DJs known as Daft Punk would imitate robots, because their music is as mindless and repetitive as something that would come from an automaton.    I've listened to a lot of bad albums, but Discovery stands out as one the most uniquely unpleasant listening experience I've ever had the misfortune of enduring. Not being satisfied with one listen, I instead subjected myself to the entire CD's length at least three times in the vain hope that it would somehow grow on me. Quite the opposite, as I found myself despising it with a greater and greater passion with every listen.    Can one honestly tell me that any effort was put into this CD when nearly every track is repetitive and cylical to a downright ludicrous degree? With the exception of \\"Digital Love\\" (the only halfway decent song on the album), each and every song consists of a single hook looped fifty to a hundred times over a simple beat for nearly the entire length of the song. Tracks go nowhere, build to nothing, and only if you're very lucky will they ever change at all. Take \\"Superheroes\\" for example, where a single vocal sample repeats for nearly three quarters of the song's duration. This wouldn't be so bad (at least, not nearly as unbearable) if the songs were at least somewhat catchy, but they're not. There's nothing remotely memorable, and at a later time I had difficulty remembering anything about any of the songs. This isn't minimalism; this is music at its most lazy and uncreative. The only circumstance in which the songs on Discovery would be remotely listenable would be if I were high out of my mind, and even then that would be doubtful.    As if maddening repetition were not enough, Discovery is replete with irritating synth samples that sound like they were dredged out of the worst of 80's synth-pop. Vocoder vocals are used throughout, and only create further irritation and disgust. The whole album comes off as sickeningly cheesy and unaware of it. If Daft Punk had conceived this album as a mockery of Dance and House music, it would be a downright brilliant satire. More cynically, Discovery sounds like it was tailor-made for television commercials; each song containing just enough material for a half-minute jingle, and repeated over and over to stretch it out to a full album.    Your tastes might vary from mine, but I don't recall ever disliking an album as much as this one. Most bad music makes me feel either disappointment or boredom, but Daft Punk's Discovery is the first to inspire outright loathing and disgust. To my amazement, I have heard that Daft Punk's latest album \\"Human After All\\" is even more repetitive in nature than this.    How is that even possible?
B000002JS8|3.0|This album rocks the highway like crazy! Highway to Hell is one<br /><br />amazing track with great riffs and vocals. If you have the money,<br /><br />buy this album just for that song.
0140441409|5.0|Although this book is the only translation that I have read on Marcus Aurelius's Mediations and do not have another example for comparison, this particular book has been a favorite and read many times.  Meditations is a timeless record of Stoic philosophy, not a religion as many people have misconceived; and therefore, this philosophy has historically received acceptance, and even, embracement.  With the heart of a warrior and the wisdom of a great leader, Aurelius shares how to weather the most difficult times, with grace and compassion.  His advice is practical and readers will identify with him on the common problems experienced by humans, and from his wisdom, learn how to apply his suggestions to our own times.  The introduction defines the Stoic Philosophy and devotes a brief section to the role that it played when the early Christian Church was formed.  Similiar to the Book of Proverbs style, it is possible to read one item every day for reflection.  This book is small enough to easily carry, and yet, the content is worth every penny of the book cost.
B000069HKH|4.0|Its ok, Mary's Place is one of the most annoying bruce songs<br /><br />ever recorded. The Rising, Lonesome Day, Waiting on a Sunny Day,<br /><br />and Further On Up The Road are all my favorites on this. Thanks<br /><br />for the review.
0743455967|5.0|I loved this book. Its candid and humorous. I want to thank Stephen King for keeping me up at night all through my child hood, and then when Im grown I get this.

B0000E1ALR|5.0|What is the big deal. The 2ND DISC HAS MANY GREAT SONGS, BORN<br /><br />IN THE USA, GLORY DAYS, DANCING IN THE DARK, HUMAN TOUCH, & THE<br /><br />RISING. Born In The USA is a track you must repeat. Recommended<br /><br />if you like Dire Straits' Brothers in Arms.
B00007FOMP|5.0|What is there to say about this landmark album that has not already been said, if your are reading this review you probally know about the hesitation for Motown to release it, Marvin's internal deamons and the like.<br /><br />However, to me this album is ageless and speaks to the human condition not matter who you are. Can't relate to Inner City Blues ?, than what about Mercy, Mercy, Me (the ecology).<br /><br />There is something here to touch anyone (that is anyone worth touching), and as our nation is once again in a war of immense question, why hasn't Whats Going On (the single) been re-released???.<br /><br />An interesting addition here is God Is Love, Marvin came from Gospel routes, but was haunted by the many forces that seemed to pull at him all at once. In this song he seemed to take comfort in knowing a God was there.<br /><br />Had Marvin not been taken from us so young, could he have given us another classic like this one??, perhaps, but then again perhaps not.
B000002G87|4.0|Layla, is actully one amazing song. It is a classic. Layla has<br /><br />a great ending to the song. Worth the money to get this since<br /><br />I havent heard this CD yet. Highly recommended for Layla.

B0007OCG4W|3.0|The menage a trois of Columbia/Tristar/Sony begets a Superbit product bringing all \\"Closer\\" to tears.    Damien Rice's \\"The Blower's Daughter\\" constitutes the bonus material--if one can call it that. Amid nine trailers, the music video from the soundtrack and Rice's debut album melts in tears.    None can take eyes nor mind off Natalie Portman's transparent face in the \\"extras\\" window.    Consumers buy the DVD to see the content of the cutting room floor. Typically, the feature falls secondary despite Dolby 5.1/DTS, high definition, anamorphic widescreen, bilingual audio and subtitles.    As for the film itself, the motif rings true: Infidelity triumphs over monogamy when all's said and done.    The Closer you get...the harder it becomes...to walk away. If viewers prefer not to watch, they need to leave \\"just like that\\" without hesitation.    \\"It's the only way to leave,\\" says Alice (Natalie Portman) Ayres.    Director Mike Nichols deserved more than mere nominations for the big screen adaptation of the award winning play, even though he shot it chronologically--for the most part--rather than Tarantino style.    Nichols also forgot caption to capture transition in his rendition. Now, the audience must pay close attention to the dialogue--God forbid.    So far, Patrick (playwright-turned-screenwriter) Marber's accurate portrayal of Love's uncertainty does not disappoint either. One should consult the original text for further insight regarding a masterpiece.    Films leave out some of the best lines sometimes: Anna (Depressive) says, \\"Love bores you.\\"    \\"No, it disappoints me,\\" replies Daniel Woolf (in Sheep's Clothing).    Then again, the somewhat-unrealistic dialogue improves when Alice (the Wonderland) bursts out \\"what a FLOOZY\\" instead of \\"what a sl*t\\" to a stranger in public.    \\"If you believe in love at first sight, you never stop looking,\\" according to the \\"Closer\\" tag line.    Luckily, love at first sight tops the rare encounters chart. Infatuation serves as one of two reasons why true believers \\"never stop looking.\\"    The worst thing a person can do is get to know someone. The process dismisses a great deal of--if not all--ideals. Remember, there is no such thing as \\"perfect.\\"    The second boils down to lust at first sight. Both mistake it for love until burning passion consumes all other aspects of their relationship.    The age-old theory ensnared my soul eight years ago, so I can attest such foolishness. The eerie part is she resembled the Golden Globe winner for best supporting actress. Her name was....
1573223026|5.0|I bought this book on impulse: the premise sounded a little different from the norm, the cover was a nice shade of blue, and I needed another purchase to reach the $25 free shipping total :) <br /> <br />I am very happy to report that it was money well spent.  <br /> <br />Nick Hornby brings together 4 very different characters, all with real problems in their lives, all about to take the plunge off the top of a tower block.. and yet his story is not dark and depressing.  <br /> Each of the four main characters take turns at telling parts of the story, which is an interesting writing technique - the reader discovers each character through the eyes of the 3 others, and also from their own ramblings. <br /> <br />Four complete strangers on the same roof, on the same night, contemplating the same fate - can they help each other? do they want to?   I won't give anything away, just take my word for it - this is a good little book.
0156027321|2.0|It's difficult to rate this book as just 2 stars.  The author, Mr. Martel, rightfully has received an outpouring of praise for his talent.  In fact, I felt a real psychological kinship with the author for many pages even beyond the first 100, which were so good. However, my 2-star rating reflects how I personally felt as a reader after finishing the book . . . very disappointed, misled and somewhat resentful that my time investment did not paying a bigger dividend.   <br /> <br />After the first 100 pages or so of excellence, the book gets TEDIOUS.  There's ocean drifting in extreme detail, with one trial after another that is ultimately irrelevant (at least to my small mind), except to make the reader appreciate the simultaneously boring, painful and trying nature of Pi's ocean voyage.  Still, it was overkill. <br /> <br />After the tedium, the book gets STUPID AND TEDIOUS. Pi encounters an acid algae island full of meerkats.  This development had two negative effects on me: first, there's the obvious tedium of reading someone's weird tales pulled out of thin air that seem to have little to do with the rest of the story (unless I want to put on a really heavy thinking cap and get creative like my old college English teachers--maybe then I could find some rationale for the Meerkat Island saga).  Second, the unapologetically fictitious nature of the Meerkat Island saga made me doubt certain interesting facts about animal behavior and swimming that Mr. Martel had weaved through the first part of the story.  Was any of that true?   <br /> <br />Yes, in retrospect, I can see where this was all leading.  I appreciate that one of the punch lines to this book is that truth is irrelevant in some sense.  But I felt then, and still do feel, a bit misled to have suspended disbelief enough to enjoy and thought I'd learned a thing or two from the first part the book only to be unable to trust any of it during the long remainder. <br /> <br />Having finished the Meerkat Algae Island saga, the book gets EVEN MORE \\"OUT THERE\\" AND TEDIOUS until Pi is interviewed by 2 men working for the Japanese Ministry of Transport.  This exchange was written quite tongue-in-cheek.  But think about what the reader has been through up until that point!  Tongue-in-cheek may have entertained the author, but I felt even less connected to the book than ever.  Though this is a fiction book, I craved a tone of reality and grounding. <br /> <br />And it's then-at that very point-that Mr. Martel gives us the \\"twist at the ending.\\"  As the reviews attest, many readers assumed this was reality and grounding.  I was tempted too.  As a reader invested at about 350 pages by then, I wanted to embrace the twist and say \\"this made it all worthwhile; now it all makes sense!\\"  But it didn't.  It didn't make sense because the new story (\\"twist\\") does not fit well with the original story.  It does in broad terms, but when I think back to details of the original story, the \\"twist\\" isn't congruent with many places-or at least not how I can see.   <br /> <br />Again, I know that the irrelevance of Truth is a big point of the book, so the sort out this fiction into something more \\"believeable\\" is beside the point intellectually--but readers have emotional needs too.   <br /> <br />Here's why truth and believeability are irrelevant in this book.  Pi asks the Japanses Minsitry investigators 2 versions of his terrible tragedy at sea and asks which they like better.  One has animals and is fantastic in the truest sense of the word.  The other is, to quote Pi, \\"a flat...dry, yeastless story.\\"  But is it really?  In that story, a man is \\"swinging his arms and catching flies and eating them greedily.\\"  Then this same big, nasty man who has done terrible things develops a conscience, thereby loses the will to live, and lets Pi kill him without a struggle?  That sounds like a real yarn-spinner story to me. <br /> <br />I suspect either bad writing here, or more likely, both stories (the mainbook plus the \\"twist ending\\") are unbelievable crocks.  Just as there's no discernibly True reason for the sinking of the ship ever found, I as a reader got no reasonable explanation for what happened to Pi at sea.  And that's okay, except I don't even get a good explanation of why I don't need a True explanation. <br /> <br />I only have theories: <br />***Pi may see investing stories as part of turning to God.  Although Pi mentions doing his prayers at sea, he only mentions turning to God after he kills someone in the second version of the story (p. 390 \\"I turned to God. I survived.\\").   <br /> <br />***Another reviewer did a nice job of summing up her take on Pi's view on religion and God.  Maybe she got it right.  Maybe Pi is saying there's no True God in the traditional sense, but only interesting and uninteresting stories (including those about God) that people either enjoy or do not enjoy.  Since the facts of life stay the same, and many religious claims are unproveable, is Pi saying one may as well pick the interesting stories you like that make reality more palatable?  Pick the religion(s) you wish? <br /> <br />***Another interpretation of Pi's perspective is that there is a God, but the stories describing for him--i.e., all the different religions--can't be validated as true or untrue sometimes and you just have to go with what story you like, and Pi likes them all.   <br /> <br />Maybe I am just not smart enough to see the ONE true message here that would make all my other criticisms pale by comparison.  If I were, maybe I'd have ended this book feeling good about what I'd read and not frustrated by little payoff for a long effort of reading.  Maybe I should call up some of my college English professors from 15 years ago so they can clear it up for me.  :-) <br />
B00005JNTX|5.0|It's not for everyone. Different, and those over 50 would probably think you were nuts for watching such a weird movie. But's it's not to be missed by anyone who appreciates a good and strange flick.<br /><br />Almost entirely CGI, it's actually beautiful and extremely well crafted. It's like one of those movies that looks like a cartoon, but with real actors. I can't get over the detail given to certain scenes. Someone really loved it into a movie.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|This is still as good as the first time I saw it years ago.
0060536357|5.0|This book covers in depth the LBO of RJR Nabisco in the late 1980s. Recommended to me by an investment banker friend that knew I wanted to go into M&A work, I decided to read it. I thought the book was excellent, but maybe unnecessarily long. The authors were meticulous in explaining everything about the deal and those involved - from the history to every single meeting and telephone conversation. The two authors never mentioned whether they were present during every conversation or not, but did an incredible job at recreating all that happened nonetheless. For someone interested in pursuing a top Wall Street job, this book is a must. For everyone else that just likes good non-fiction, this book does a superb job at representing the greed of an era.
6304119046|5.0|My favorite passage of dialogue from the film: \\"A fellow will remember a lot of things you wouldn't think he'd remember,\\" Mr. Bernstein (Kane's manager) says. \\"You take me. One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on the ferry, and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in, and on it there was a girl waiting to get off. A white dress she had on. She was carrying a white parasol. I only saw her for one second. She didn't see me at all, but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.\\"  That was written by Herman J. Mankiewicz, and Welles himself had to agree it was the best passage in the script.  But he got his \\"revenge,\\" if you will, when he inserted the most memorable line (\\"cuckoo clocks,\\" etc.) into Graham Greene's superb screenplay for The Third Man (another one of the greats). <br />
B000B5XOSO|5.0|The reviewer Alan Stowe gets it.  Batman Returns was a good movie.  It is visually one of the best looking films I have seen (especially for that time period).  I love the first Batman movie and I think I'm programed to say that its my favorite, but I watch Batman Returns alot more just because the look of the film.  Every character had thier own background story, their own look, complete with thier own theme music (by Danny Elfman).  The costumes were well designed (and worn well).  The movie (like the first) had a lot of iconic scenes that were very memorable, like when the bat symbol was lit and Bruce Waynes stands up in his study with the emblem shining on the wall behind him, or when Batman meets Penguin and Catwoman for the first time face to face, and my favorite scene when Batman removes his mask by ripping it off.  Hot!  There are alot of things that I love about the movie also... like how drastic Michael Keaton changes his voice between Bruce Wayne and Batman.  I am a comic fan and a movie buff.  Batman Begins satified the comic fan in me, but Batman Returns did both.
0385491026|5.0|Top 50. I've probably read this book three times. The first time, I was about 21 years old and maybe not far enough yet out of the hard kind of high school years that those of us glasses-wearing skinny smart loner girls have if we're not careful. One of the creepiest, scariest, saddest books I've ever encountered. Atwood gets inside the skin of a teenage girl not only scorned, but tortured by her peers. Gripping, and makes huge demands on one's empathy, compassion, and patience for the main character. Great moments of beauty, but real encounters with evil, apathy, and terror.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|The first song I heard off of this album was track #7, \\"Wake Up\\".  My reactions at the time were \\"wow, this sounds pretty special\\", then \\"actually, this is really good\\", to \\"man, this is kinda brilliant\\". <br /> <br />The same goes for the rest of the album.  There is tremendous energy, intelligence, and musicianship in this album.  What makes it really stand out from other contemporary bands is the instrumentation - sounds like there are about a gazillion instruments playing on each song.  While this could lead to a muddled/muffled type of over-inflated production for other bands, here it is absolutely gorgeous.  The sound is tremendously rich, with nothing superfluous. <br /> <br />Also, each track really stands out, and the melodies/chord structures are all at once simple, catchy, and original.  Very very high quality pop. <br /> <br />Why only four stars?  Very honestly, the lyrics lose me a bit.  Don't get me wrong, lyrically the album is fascinating, and clearly carries a number of themes throughout the record.  Two things bother me a little bit: (i) the lyrics are a bit too personal, and incomprehensibly baroque at first listen - you need to know about the bandmembers' history a bit to get them, and (ii) many of the lyrics are jarringly somber and melancholy, which doesn't seem to jive with the upbeat tempo of the songs.  As a result, the songs come across as a massive collaborative effort, but with perhaps more focus on the music (which sounds wonderfully organic) than the lyrics (which sound like one or two person wrote all of them and then forgot about them when the music was being composed).  Also (but this is a small point): elocution.  Difficult to understand what they're singing without the booklet at hand. <br /> <br />These are pretty minor drawbacks, though.  Overall, very highly recommended: it's moving, fun, and haunting music.  You'll be listening to it for a long time.
0804106304|4.0|I first read this book nearly ten years ago and I can still remember passages of it that last for probably three pages. This was one of my first exposures to Chinese culture, and being introduced to China by someone who feels both inside and outside the culture felt like a rare privilege, a gift from someone who is generous and compelled to give away as much as she can.<br /><br />This was also a welcome return to women protagonists after a college education that relied too heavily on male voices to tell most stories. The women in this book are strong -- headstrong and lifestrong -- and there's nothing \\"women's studies\\" about the writing here. This is a good book, period, no need to ghettoize it.
B0000035E7|5.0|This is a great album. Right now I think its their best.<br /><br />BUT Don't expect<br /><br />1. the pop-like catchyness of \\"nevermind\\" and hits like \\"smells like teen spirit\\". (Which, don't get me wrong, - are great)<br /><br />or<br /><br />2. The sweet beauty of unplugged in NY.<br /><br />- Expect raw and unspoiled heavy bassline and distortioness 90'ies ROCK!
B00005V1Y0|4.0|Both my wife and I thought this movie was thoroughly enjoyable and ranked right up there with Shall We Dance (both versions).
B00023B1LC|4.0|For once Hollywood managed to produce a good movie that was only PG-13...<br /><br />Amidst hundreds of garbage Hollywood films, there are a couple that are actually pretty good, and this is one of them. Things get a bit predictable, but the end is slightly unexpected. It is well done, though it does, as many modern action movies do, rely heavily on special effects to keep it going.<br /><br />I like Matt Damon, and this, like his other films, is quite good, and worth watching
B000023VR6|4.0|This is a very solid sophmore album by arguably the best producer in Hip Hop, but it does not even compare to the jams that he created with the Death Row inmates on THE CHRONIC in 1992.  When 2001 was released, it was a long overdue follow up to one of the best albums in history, and it was as good as should have been expected.  All tracks on here have solid production, with the 3 or 4 that go down as some of his best beats, and though it was refreshing to hear Dre and his producing skills again, THE CHRONIC is far better.  Every single song on his debut album was skillfully laced with funky rythms that would make Bootsy Collins and George Clinton proud and consisted of a young and energetic Snoop along with the rest of the crew to make that album a classic.  2001 is good and is one of the best produced albums of the past 6 years, and when the songs hit hard here, they're hitting real hard.  \\"Xxplosive\\" is a classic that is a little underated, mostly because Dre isn't on it, with a great verses from Kurupt and Nate Dogg.  Of course there are the commercial tracks \\"Still...\\" and \\"Forgot...,\\" but don't be fooled, these tracks are only the tip of the ice burg, from a production standpoint.  The raps by several B-artists bring this album down a little and the gangsta lyrics that were new and innovative in the early 90's seem to be worn out here, but what would a Dre album be without gangsta raps.  All in all, this a good album that was released at a time when rap most needed it, but if you don't own THE CHRONIC, I strongly recommend that album to see the Good Dr. at his best.
1582403589|5.0|Wow! I loved this book! It was very touching and kept me excited all the way through, I was very surprised as i was reading it. It started out like \\"28 days later\\" in the way that the main character was in a short coma and just woke up after the world had gone to hell. I even loved how he worked in the dilusional(sp?) person in the way that he thinks someone is gonna just \\"Save the world\\" and it'll all be better. I think that no other zombie movie has done anything like this and since this is a graphic novel, we don't have to worry about sucky movies that try to do the same as the first, and a constant change of actors and actreses (with the exception of The Great George A. Romero), no this is an on going story and it brings a diffrent spice into the genre that i thing has been missing all these years. I really liked it and am enjoying the rest of the series. <br /> <br />J.Kie

Go out and find it. <br /> <br />I have three- the LP, CD, and DVD and almost forget my picture disk on my shelf for posterity, strawberry apples, 12 inch plastic gimples,  silvery micro disk, saw it on a laptop over the drink, icelandic green ones blackberry signals for all to see.  Are you buying?  But before I have to run, the soundtrack is also fun, George's paisley stratocastery, Paul's bass line mastery, Ringo's a rich man on the snares, and John's voice is indescribable but perfect. You'll see its really a period piece on UK black pool nights, a limey's keg party not one flew over the cuckoo's bus trip, nor any freaky 60's clip, but jolly old fun for u.s. with an English spin.  <br /> <br />I am the Carpenter!

B000A59PMO|4.0|I didn't watch the show when it was originally aired.  I started wathcing re-runs on TV and then I downloaded the eps.  Overall it is a very good show.  Kristin Bell is amazing as Veronica Mars - teen detective.  She has the perfect ammount of sarcasm that she is funny, not annoying.  She is a great character because she is easy to relate to and fun to watch. Some of the other characters are boring and weak to watch.  <br />   <br />  My only complaint about this show is that it is inconsistant.  If an episode is good, then it is phenominal.  But inbetween the great episodes there are quite a few that aren't even worth watching. <br /> <br />  The story starts by introducing Veronica.  She talks about how she was raped the previous year and how her best friend was murdered.  Also, her mother ran out on her.  The season goes on to solve these mysteries along with other mini-mysteries.   <br />   <br />  The best part of this show is the flashbacks.  They go back to show Lily (the friend) and many other things.  It is a great and original way to show how everything happened. <br /> <br />  Overall, it is an awesome show, but it does have many weak points.  If you like the mystery shows like CSI or MONK you should give it a try.  I won't buy it, just because I don't see myself watching it over and over again.  But I did enjoy watching it the first time.   <br /> <br />  (If you like this show, you should also give ALIAS a try.  It's great! See other review)
B00005JMAH|4.0|This movie is definitely darker than the first two.  It didn't do as well at the box office, but I think there are two reasons for that:  (a) The people who liked the first two movies probably went away a bit disappointed.  (b) The people who might have liked this movie probably didn't go to see it, thinking it would be more of the same, which it isn't. <br /> <br />What I liked the most about this movie was that the big three (Harry, Hermione, and Ron) are given a chance to act--and they can act!  In the first two movies Ron especially was forced to do little more than scrunch up his face to look stunned, baffled, awed, scared, etc.  What a waste.  The quality of the acting from all three of the kids was very impressive--especially when you consider they were chosen initially because they \\"looked\\" like the characters in the books, and they could easily have all turned out to be duds, with absolutely no acting ability.  The fact that all three can act is nothing short of a miracle. <br /> <br />In several cases, I thought the screenplay was actually an improvement on the book.  This is heresy, I know.  But listen, in the movie, it's Hermione who realizes that they're to save Buckbeak--which makes much more sense and gives Hermione her due, while in the book it's Harry who makes the connection, something that is slightly out of character for him.  I also like the way that Hermione blows open Sirius's jail cell door near the end (girl power all the way, woohoo).  And the way that Harry overhears the conversation in the pub is much more believable in the film, as it makes use of the invisibility cloak, rather than on the fairly lame \\"move a tree in front of the table\\" ploy in the book. <br /> <br />The special effects are awesome, a big improvement especially over the first movie.  The scene where Harry rides Buckbeak is worth the price of admission all by itself.  The clocktower, bogart scenes, dementors, broomstick scenes, etc., are all done quite convincingly. <br /> <br />The scenery is spectacular and is used to good effect, with the talks between Harry and Prof. Lupin, especially, being done in places where there is very nice eye candy to look at in the background.   <br /> <br />There are also a lot of nice smaller touches, like the scene with the student choir singing \\"Something wicked this way comes.\\"  It's cute, but also adds a real touch of atmosphere.  The womping willow is used as a nice comic relief element, as are the shrunken heads.  (I could have done without the shrunken heads in the extra features part, where I felt it detracted from the otherwise very interesting interviews with the cast and crew.) <br /> <br />When I first watched the movie, I wasn't as impressed with it as I am now, after I've watched it half a dozen times at least.  For me, this movie has enough going on visually to give it quite a bit of replay value--and the eye candy is almost always left in the background so that it doesn't detract from the solid screenplay and the advancement of the storyline.   <br /> <br />I couldn't quite give this one five stars, but it's probably worth 4.5 when it comes right down to it.  Very solid, and certainly the best HP movie so far. <br />
076790592X|3.0|This is a good book.  I like some of Albom's other work like The 5 People you Meet in Heaven... BUT this is not any earthshaking material, certainly not \\"life's greatest lesson\\"... Morrie is no great philosopher and the fact that Ted Koppel put him on Nightline means very little to me sorry.  Just a sad story about someone dying who had a positive outlook on life.  Not the greatest story every told....
B00001IVOF|5.0|No one, and I mean, NO ONE can touch this album.  Mobb Deep has hip hop on LOCK!  I wish we still had this quality of hip hop today.  Maybe I would still listen to present day rap.   <br /> <br />Mobb Deep = Hip Hop!!!!!
B00006RCSR|4.0|My two young girls really enjoy this movie and have seen it many times.   What an nice twist on the Cinderella plot.  Drew Barrymore is wonderful and her character, Gabrielle, is an inspiration.
0380820846|3.0|Julia Quinn is always a top notch romance author.  So this book is still 3 stars, all in all, however this was not my favorite book.  I never felt connected to the characters and I think too much emphasis was placed on the Lady Whistledown plot line.  Penelope was an interesting character, but Colin felt a little flat and never rose to the 'greatness' that Penelope constantly attributed to him.  He just didn't seem worthy of her adoration.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Binaural (2000.), the Pearl Jam's sixth studio album<br /><br />The Pearl Jam were one of the great, if not the greatest rock acts of the 90's. From being part of the 'grunge' alternative rock explosion at first, the band were able to go off in their own direction by the end of the decade. By 2000, they were probably the only band from the grunge era to be still together, much to most people's amazement; not surprising, due to the band's withdrawal from the media spotlight. 'Binaural', the Pearl Jam's sixth studio album, released in 2000 is the capture of the great band entering the new millenium. 'Binaural' has proved to be the Pearl Jam's most criticised studio album, producing controversial opinions from reviewers and fans of the band alike. However, does this album really deserve its reputation as an ok but overly flat album?<br /><br />When I first bought 'Binaural', I was sceptical. I expected to like it but I reckoned that it wouldn't be in the league of 'Ten', 'Vs.', 'Yield' and 'No Code'. After a couple of listens to this album, I couldn't have been more wrong. 'Binaural' is one of those rare works, an album that sounds like no other, a disc that has a sound to it that's so unique whilst at the same time being unmistakably Pearl Jam. In fact, I would go as far to say that after 'Ten' and 'Yield', this album is next best in terms of greatness. Ok, the album overly lacks the aggression of 'Vs.' or the pure rockability of 'Yield' but it more than makes up for it in superb songwriting, diversity and atmospherics. That's not to say the album doesn't have its harder sometimes punk rocking moments like with 'Grievance' or 'Breakerfall' but on the whole the album is reflective and impacts on the senses in an undescribable fashion. Many people have dissed this album for the things I consider as plusses on the album. Many probably forget (non-fans who happen to own this album can be excused from this) that the Pearl Jam always look for a new direction every album and really this album, with its unique style, is one they had to make - fans especially must remember that this band have experimentation at their core. 'Binaural' is also the first Pearl Jam album to feature ex-Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron, who replaced Jack Irons. Certainly a great addition to the band, some of the drumming, 'Grievance' is the song that comes to mind, is excellent. Furthermore, this is an album where the guitar work is much more subtle. McCready's guitar work may not be solo filled, but nevertheless the lower key but certainly adept guitar work works well with the album's style.<br /><br />To get things rolling, the album begins in rocking fashion, with the short 'Breakerfall'. The influence of the Who is definitely here in this one and that's no bad thing in this powered opener. Following this is another short song, the punk rocking 'God's Dice'. On a first listen this song didn't really do it for me, but over time I've appreciated it more; not quite classic Pearl Jam but I'll take it nonetheless! However, next up is a great song in 'Evacuation'. I found this one quite catchy; the drumming is powerful and this backdrops well to Vedder's howling chorus. Then we come to the longer more thoughtful stuff. 'Light Years' is a heartfelt lyrical offering from Vedder with some great but subtle guitar play. Similarly, the thoughtful theme continues with 'Nothing As It Seems', a more downbeat sounding song but with more atmospheric moments. 'Thin Air' is an acoustic gem with some more great lyrics and 'Insignificance', next up, has some sombre but compelling guitar melodies, and a superb crashing chorus. After this impressive passage, things get even better with the beautifully complex 'Of The Girl' with more hushed but striking vocals from Eddie Vedder and some luscious guitar work. Following this is the Grammy-nominated 'Grievance', a stunning track to say the least both lyrically and instrumentally. The pace of the track changes a few times but it worksmagnificently, especially where the drumming is concerned; a great protest song that only Vedder himself could pen. 'Rival' follows this; a step down from previous songs but still a good song, with an interesting growling dog opening. Then we have 'Sleight Of Hand', slow but atmospheric; a classic that builds but to great climax. 'Soon Forget' is an interesting interlude consisiting of Eddie Vedder and a ukelele. Its a poetic ramble that draws comparisons with The Who song 'Blue, Red and Grey'; again though I have no problems with the Pearl Jam being influenced by The Who. Then, to finish this great album we have the emotionally moving and striking 'Parting Ways'. Vedder's vocals are at their most reflective here and the song exit, using guitar and violins/cellos is heart-rendering.<br /><br />If you had to take the two albums which the Pearl Jam have made which have a difference of opinion right down the middle between fans, you have 'Vitalogy' and 'Binaural'. With the former I was on the sceptical side, enjoying a fair share of the album but being left disappointed by some moments, however with 'Binaural' I'm firmly in the positive. This album is a mellow but atmospheric and compelling stroke of genius. Eventhough this is up there with the best (in my opinion), I wouldn't recommend this album to a newbie to the Pearl Jam - that's what 'Yield' is for. However, any fan who appreciates the Pearl Jam's evolvoing and experimental edge should enjoy this album and appreciate its greatness. I'll not doubt that it needs a few listens to get into but nevertheless it is one hell of a masterpiece, just sadly an album that has become underrated and bashed by critics.lly where the drumming is concerned; a great protest song that only Vedder himself could pen.

B000B5XOSO|4.0|If you love Tim Burton, you'll love this movie. If you don't like him, you'll probably hate it. That's because this is one of the few movies in Burton's career where he had absolute, total controll over what happened, a decision WB came to regret when idiot parents brought their babies to a movie about a deformed maniac who lives in the sewer and complained.  <br />The movie still did fine, over $160 million in its time. Adjusted, that's still well over what Batman Begins made, although far under Batman's (1989) gross of $250 million. <br /> <br />This is not an action movie, but rather a dark fary-tale based on Batman characters. The Penguin is an absolute twisted delight as The Penguin, although some fans gripe that his orgin was changed from the Comic Books (as if the Comic Book characters aren't constantly changing, themselves!). He's funny and creepy, and Michelle Pfiefer is nearly as good as Catwoman. <br />Christopher Walken is a third wheel on a villainous bike, and his part could have been done without. It is interesting to note that his character was originally Harvey Dent, to be played by Billy-Dee Williams, and would have become Two-Face at the end of the movie. Batman takes a back seat to the villains in this particular chapter, but Michael Keaton is still very convincing.  <br />With a bigger budget, Burton was allowed even more beautiful visuals. Gotham City never looked better (and never looked as good again, with the exception of Batman: The Animated Series) as it does in its Art Deco, timeless form here. <br /> <br />The movie is far from perfect, but definitely worth trying. Some people can't stand its abandon, imagination, and inventiveness, and prefer a more realistic version of the character, which they got in Batman Begins. But Tim Burton's version of the character will always be one of my favorite interpretations.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|This is a Bad movie from start to finish. <br />Perhaps the trend of tranfering comix books into big screen <br />movies has begun to play itself out. And its time for Hollywood <br />to find some fresh material to use. <br /> <br /> In my estamation this movie was poorly concieved and directed. I've have read one or two of the Hellbound books. They are <br />fairly good. (If your into catholic guilt that is!) <br /> <br /> But sometimes whats just so so on paper, can be really good <br />on film. I was hoping this would be so with Constantine. <br /> <br /> Sadly I was mistaken. Keanue Reeves performance was nothing more that a wise cracking version of his charicter in the Matrix. <br /> <br /> I have two suggestions. <br />  <br />1.Save your money and buy or rent much better movies. <br />Such as the oringinal 60's film \\"The Haunting\\" with Julie Harris <br />and Claire Bloom. or \\"Rosemarie's Baby\\" with Mia Farrell. <br />Or the overlooked mid 70's flick \\"The Sentinal\\". <br />  <br />2.Please Keanue, find yourself some better roles. and get out <br />of the \\"Matrix\\"! <br />
B000B5XOY8|5.0|With all the current hype surrounding Batman Begins now, fans seem to forget all the excitment they had when Tim Burton's version of Batman was released in 1989. Of course, die-hard fans allways knew the true Batman was a dark and sophisticated character, but in the public eye, Batman was Adam West in that goofy outfit who shouted campy one-liners at villains like Burgess Merideth and Julie Newmar. This movie single-handedly turned that image around and had an even bigger impact than today's Batman Begins (much as I love Begins) on the perception the \\"average joe\\" person had of the Dark Knight.<br /><br />Keaton's performance as Batman is under-rated because it is subtle. The character is there and it's a finely nuanced performance, but so many people seem to skip over it completely, then later complaining that Jack Nicholson stole the show. Nicholson as the Joker does, in fact, do a wonderful job balancing fear with humor.<br /><br />Visually, the movie is a real treat. The movie looks timeless because Tim Burton wanted a movie that would last into the future that made usage of every version of Batman thus far. So, the movie is not set in 1989, and it is not set in 1939, but a timeless, gothic, art deco hell that is wonderfull to look at. The late Anton Furst won a production design Oscar for his work.<br /><br />This DVD looks like it's packed with goodies, which is excellent because I've held off on buying the bare bones DVD a long time. It looks like my patience is finally paying off!

B00009W0WM|5.0|Those classic movies that took place in a exotic place are just plain delicious, \\"Casablanca\\" it's obviously one of the best films of all time, but what it is that holds that magical spirit in it, well in my own humble opinion, the simple story of love always got the human race, love is what matters after all, and Casablanca gives a perspective of a different kind of love, how can you learn to let go, if you love that deep.  An amazing movies that won't stop to amaze many people around the world, this is why Hollywood was the capital of the movies.  That era is truly missed, but hopeful that new movies will come and be more smart than some later material from tinseltown.
B00005JN5X|4.0|The critics have given this movie a bad review, but I and my pre-teen boy enjoyed it very much.  Apparently, the critics were hung up by comparing this movie to others directed by Gilliam, but since I had not seen those, I was able to evaluate the movie on its own terms.  The action moved quickly and was easy enough to follow.    Of course, the plot was not deep, but who in their right mind was expecting it would be?  Just a simple, fun, action movie that will entertain, if approached without preconceived notions.
B000002B5L|4.0|Ready or Not-- Boadicea with additional beats sounds great no matter who uses is,  Lauryn really shines in this one, easpecially in the middle when shes singing. 3.5/5 <br /> <br />Zealots-- Wyclefs singing brings this song down, I don't like it very much, poor sampling, Jean and Hills rapping is AMAZING in this song \\"And after all my logic and my theory, I add a motherf*cker so you ignant n*ggas here me\\" awesome! 4/5 <br /> <br />The Beast-- Nice Message, the only song on the album where I feel Wyclef's rapping can compare to Lauryn's, the Chinese restaurant skit is hilarious as well. 2.5/5 <br /> <br />Fu-Gee-La-- Pras could have done better sampling this song. The highlight is Hill's attitude. 3.5/5 <br /> <br />Killing Me Softly-- Lauryn's singing is so amazing, the vocalizing near the end is a little over-the-top, but she makes it sound good. 4/5 <br /> <br />The Score-- This song is intense, the marching the lyrics, the message, I wish Pras wouldn't have sampled Fu-Gee-La, and No Woman, No Cry, it sounds very out of place, it climaxes again when Lauryn starts to spit. My favorite song on the album 4.5/5 <br /> <br />No Woman, No Cry-- Wyclefs emotion while singing this is very good. He did a very good job of keeping it Marley.3.5/5 <br /> <br />Manifest- All three rappers show so much emotion in this song, the scratching is perfect 4/5 <br /> <br />
B000002HPV|4.0|Hunter-- This song is a nice intro to a better album, sounds cool, but I think it's too inconsistent. 2/5  <br /> <br />Joga-- Wonderful mix of electronica and orchestral music, Bjork's voice fits perfectly in the blend 3.5/5 <br /> <br />Unravel-- The eerie low pitched music seems to disappear, Bjork sounds very bare. 3/5 <br /> <br />Bachelorette-- I love the music, however Bjorks strained voice seems obnoxious in this song. 1/5 <br /> <br />All Neon Like-- Very slow moving, but the sounds are fabulous, I wish the lyrics made more sense though. 3/5 <br /> <br />5 Years-- I love this song, the music is wonderful, Bjork sounds great, and the lyrics are quality. 4/5 <br /> <br />Immature-- Bjork's voice is at its strongest in this song, the music is a little offbeat though. 3/5 <br /> <br />Alarm Call-- This song gets a lot of criticism that it does't deserve, its got the most complicated set of sounds on the whole album, Bjork also sounds great, and even though the lyrics are strange, they have a good message. My favorite song on the album. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />Pluto-- This song is awesome, I love the static and roughness it has, and if you can appreciate Bjorks voice enough, this song isnt as bad as it seems. 3/5 <br /> <br />All Is Full Of Love-- I really like how her voice travels from speaker to speaker, too bad this song doesnt really have much going on, and the ringing sounds, cricketty sounding? I'm not really sure how to describe it, seems a little overwhelming at times. 3/5
B00000ADG2|4.0|Some of this album is absolutely brilliant, and other parts (namely most of the middle tracks)are just repetitive bores with positive messages <br /> <br />Lost Ones-- 2/5 that chorus is really obnoxious <br />Ex-Factor-- 4.5/5 great message, singing is outstanding <br />To Zion-- 2.5/5 I love what she sings about, i just don't like the way she sings it <br />Doo-Wop(That Thing)-- 4/5 nice view on men and women great rapping that flows with the great chorus <br />Superstar--3.5 <br />Final Hour-- 2/5 the beginning of that bore in the center <br />When It Hurts So Bad-- 2/5 <br />I Used To Love Him-- 2/5 <br />Forgive Them Father-- 2/5 <br />Every Ghetto, Every City-- 3.5/5 This song is a nice break from all that trash in the middle <br />Nothing Even Matters-- 4/5 D'Angelo and Lauryn Hill sound so good together <br />Everything Is Everything-- 4.5/5 This is my favorite song on the album, great outlook on life. <br />The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill-- 4/5 Nice song for deep thinkers to relate to <br />Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You-- 3.5/5 Her sounds so pleasant in this cover. <br />Sweetest Thing--2.5/5 bad way to end a generally great album.
B00003CXCD|5.0|I'm sorry...I know it's not the thing to attach the word \\"perfect\\" to reviewing a movie (something about personal perspective...blah blah blah), but I seriously can't use any other word for this movie. I LOVE it! I saw it this morning (some would say I'm s hyped up because I just saw it). But I really have an urge to see it again just for Audrey Hepburn's performance and the views of Rome. Very few movies move me to want to buy it (after the first viewing). I enjoyed the beginning and middle but (Mini-spoiler) near the end I was afraid that it would take the cheesy Hollywood-Romance ending that while cute is very clichd and unrealistic. Thank Goodness my fears were not realized; the ending was absolutely perfect. Audrey definitely takes the place of my favorite actress with this role. She even won an Oscar for it! This movie easily is one of the best romantic movies ever made so I whole-heartedly recommend it!

B00008BLB8|2.0|Late '60s, early '70s band from Flint, Michigan came up from the ranks of self promotion and constant touring to establish themselves as America's favorite hard rock party band. So with Grand Funk classics like the hard rock bluesy \\"Heartbreaker\\", would be prog pretty, \\"Closer To Home\\", and later successful hits like the airplay aplenty, \\"Some Kind Of Wonderful\\", and the Little Eva remake, \\"Loco-Motion\\", why does this live recording from 1975 sound as lifeless as a dormant railroad track, and as tiring as an after-party Tylenol? Could be that the band was losing it's appeal as their total output proved the party was chaperoned by a desperate attempt to remain on track with super produced hit singles rendering the band's original American sound anonymous. The uninspired drum solo is here as is an indifferent three minute treatment of the Todd Rundgren produced big hit single, \\"We're An American Band\\", which the band merely checks off their song list, as if impatient to get it out of the way, while \\"The Railroad\\" offers a gentler and heavier Grand Funk as a hard working class blues oriented rock band. The earlier \\"Grand Funk Live Album\\" is the one to get, showcasing this suburban teenage no-future spirit before the spoils of success.

B0001HAHXW|1.0|'Me and Mr Johnson' (fnarr fnarr) 'When You Got a Good Friend' (fnarr fnarr) 'They're Red Hot' (Mr Johnson getting over excited then? fnarr fnarr) and last, but by no means least, the miss-spelled track 14 on the UK sister site: 'Hell Hound on my Tail' (fnarr fnarr and fnarr again). Well, if I had possession over judgement day, I'd tell Mr Clapton to put Mr Johnson away before you get an eric, Eric.<br /><br />I know it was a contractual obligation for white people to listen to the Blues back in the good old days of radical chic, but do we actually have to listen to this bilge now by choice? \\"Gonna beat mah woe-mun 'till I get satisfac-shawn.\\" Well, put down that ghastly harmonica and you might manage a blinding right hook, son. \\"Ahm, jess a travelin' man.\\" Good, here's the ticket. They had a whip round for you at the women's shelter. \\"Kind Hearted Women Blues\\". That must be a women who actually stands still for you as you clench your fist. If I see anything anywhere that has 'blues', 'travelling' or 'riverside' in the title, I cross the street. Even if there's a truck coming.<br /><br />People actually still sit around and listen to this? Trust me, palefaces, you don't have to. Free at least! We is free at last! Trouble is, where I live everytime a cell phone rings you have to listen to the Jihad jingle. But it's still preferable to the blues.<br /><br />\\"Mr Johnson, what are you doing? Lordy, lordy, put that thing away! No, I mean't that Eric Clapton CD, not that other thing that ain't much to look at anyhows. This is Chicago.\\"

B00005JNQA|3.0|\\"The interpreter\\", directed by Sydney Pollack, is a thriller that deals with a plot to kill Zuwanie (Earl Cameron), the dictator of Motobo (a fictional African country) in front of the United Nations' General Assembly. The pace is quick, the general premise interesting, and the actors excellent, but in the end the movie is just good, not great.<br /><br />The main character is Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman), an interpreter working for the United Nations, who lived a long time in Motobo. One day, Silvia returns to the interpreters' booth in order collect some things she forgot, and by chance hears some conspirators whispering in Ku (the language of Motobo) about a plan to kill Zuwanie. Unfortunately for Silvia, they see her, but she manages to escape. The following day, Silvia goes to the police to tell them what she heard. The problem is, they are not totally sure they believe her. And as events develop, one of the officers in charge of protecting visiting dignitaries, a very troubled Tobin Keller (Sean Penn), begins to suspects that Silvia has more reasons that anyone else to kill Zuwabi. In the end, it is difficult to know who is lying, and why.<br /><br />The ending is somewhat surprising, but it feels a little contrived. Also, there are hints throughout the movie of an emotional connections of sorts forming between Silvia and Tobin, but nothings gets round to happening, and some spectators will end up saying aloud \\"Is that all?\\" at the end of the movie. At least, that is what happened to me.<br /><br />Notwithstanding that, I would like to point that I specially enjoyed two of the extra features included in the dvd, \\"The Ultimate Movie Set: The United Nations\\" and \\"A Day in the Life of Real Interpreters\\". My favorite was the first one, in which the director and part of the crew talk about the process of gaining permission to shoot in the building, and what it meant for them to get it, turning \\"The interpreter\\" into the first film to be shot inside the United Nations Headquarters. That feature also shows extra shoots of the building, the General Assembly and the room where the public sessions of the Security Council are held (depending on the issue, there are also private meetings not open to the public).<br /><br />On the whole, and despite the excellent acting, I think that this movie was no more than adequate. Truth to be told, the thing I'll probably remember more about \\"The interpreter\\" is its set, that is, the United Nations' building. But... I believe that something is wrong with a film when the most noteworthy feature is the setting.<br /><br />Belen Alcateature also shows extra shoots of the building, the General Assembly and the room where the public sessions of the Security Council are held (depending on the issue, there are also private meetings not open to the public).

0316172324|4.0|Blink is a short and artful compendinum of many known incidents of foretelling in a crisis.  There isn't a lot new here but its a well told stringing together incidents resolved by intuition. But intuition is too lax a discription. What, Gladwell really reveals is how bits and pieces of our past exprience come instantly together, a processes suggestive of lens clouded with the detrius of missinformation, but one which still renders the outlines of fact in the blur and hurry of a needed decision.  \\"Blink\\" will be new stuff to many but to those who have been around a whild it is nonetheless a refresher course how decisions are made, often under duress.
6305508550|5.0|I'm not really into comedies at all...but one time after complaining about my new office job, my friend sat me down to watch this movie.  I had no hopes of enjoying it, but I constantly found myself exclaiming, \\"It's just like that!!\\"<br /><br />You'll recognize the annoying lady with the chippery, redundant phone voice.  You'll sympathize with the 10 bosses that visit you at all hours of the workday.  You'll understand it completely if you've ever had an office job.<br /><br />I love this movie and I can see it over and over without getting sick of it.  It's highly amusing.
068987474X|2.0|This has been one phenomenon that I can't quite comprehend.  Who really needs this kind of book to tell you what should be obvious if you listen to your gut instincts.  These authors are now rolling in the dough, because they wrote about a common sense approach to figuring out if a guy likes you.  If a guy doesn't call you again after a date, what does that tell you?  I know you can answer these questions yourself without reading this.  Put your money to a better book.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Tastes in music vary, but I strongly believe people with all sorts of preferences will love this CD.<br /><br />It's brilliant--the songs are catchy, melodic, soulful, and flow which is incredibly important to me.  Each song has those qualities and each song is very unique.  It's very enjoyable to listen to, and I'm sure I can listen to it again and again (actually, I'm probably proving this true right now).<br /><br />Keep an open mind though, maybe...the first time I heard it, I was irritated and flipped through each track within the first 5 seconds of each song.  I couldn't have been more incorrect.  Give it a chance and it might grow on you like it did me.  I know this CD is one I'll be keeping for a very, very long time.
B000AU9UYM|3.0|I am not a Batman zealot and in fact only saw the first two Batman movies, the first of which was excellent. Therefore, I approached this movie with an open mind: looking for stylishly presented entertainment. Well, hmmm. This movie has a very convoluted story line with lots of characters who look almost identical, and is shot apparently without the aid of any lights. The only person that can be seen clearly is Michael Caine, who also is the only charming and/or accessible character in this morass. For almost 2/3 of the movie I could not tell what was going on because it was simply too dark. I was not alone in this opinion as my four companions (age range from 5 to 66) concurred. That said, the fear-inducing substance part of the story resulted in some great scary effects, Mr. Cruise's girlfriend has a lovely face, and the Batmobile was cool. The movie pays significant homage to the first Batman movie, which is a positive.<br />Just a note: so the bad guys (Liam \\"Qui-Gonn\\" Neeson whose still waiting for a role without a samurai sword) vaporize the hallucinogen-tainted water with a giant microwave. However, Ms. Holmes and some extra child hunker down right in front of the thing and all that happens to them is their hair gets decorously blown around. Remember, humans are over 70% water. What would happen in real life?<br />Now before you diss my review think: how was this movie really, aside from it's heavily marketed mystical appeal? Be honest.
B00007GZQZ|4.0|I remember this movie being one of my favorites as a kid.  Whenever I heard the Money Pit was going to be on TV, I'd race to go watch it.<br /><br />The acting is great and Tom Hanks is hilarious.  There were so many scenes that make you just think, \\"Ohhh no, those poor people...\\"  Everything that could go wrong with this couple's new house goes wrong.  It almost starts getting predictable...but it's still extremely entertaining to the end.<br /><br />Makes you want to check out your new house a little more before you hand over the money (to the realtor, not the house of course).
B00005JN5X|3.0|The dominant personality on THE BROTHERS GRIMM is that of the director Terry Gilliam, whose love of myth and fantasy and of course silly Pythonesque irreverence of course infects this film.  <br /> <br />Will (Matt Damon) and Jacob (Heath Ledger) Grimm are con men who make money by staging paranormal incidents and then \\"exterminating\\" the witch, monster, whatever. Most of the plot involves the brothers efforts to stop a real monster, a Wicked Queen (Monica Bellucci, underused) who has kidnapped a dozen children from a village in an attempt to regain eternal youth. Plenty of scares and silliness ensue before the brothers final showdown with the Queen. <br /> <br />There are some dead spots, but Matt Damon and Heath Ledger carry things along quite well. Damon shows a too-rarely used comic side and Ledger continues to unleash his inner character actor (as he did in LORDS OF DOGTOWN)with an impressively flustered performance. THE BROTHERS GRIMM is a farce, but also a celebration of the oral tradition....the brothers make money off the fear of old stories but learn much about themelves when the encounter a true one.  <br /> <br />I don't want to overintellectualize though. This movie is a good time, with good effects and fun allusions to classic fairy tales. With Lena Headey, Jonathan Pryce, Mackenzie Crook, and a florid Peter Stormare as an army officer who gets in touch with his inner Grimm.....Recommended..
B000069HK2|5.0|hey if u want to buy a totally kick ass cd and u wanna listen to some sweet music definetly look into the used. i listened to only one song of theirs and i was completely hooked. their lyrics actually mean something which not most bands can say and the way they portray their talent and sing their music makes them truly different from any other band. trust me on this one, if you really want to rock out and headbang and just have a great time, listen to the used, because in my opinion they are the best choice.
B0008ISM40|5.0|Of course we have all been waiting for Micheal Trent's next big release, and some thought that it may never come. Was the original work already over after we recieved a live disc with DVDs ( the sign of most bands that the creative process is over), or was it just a gift to the fans as we lie in  wait for the next disc? Now we know that the process of genius that is NIN was just waiting for the right time to release a great album, and was not going to sacrafice quality to rush out some collection of songs way under par just for some money. <br />     And the wait was well worth it! We now again have an exellent Halo disc to add to our collections. Plus it gives us the opportunity to listen to it in glorious 5.1 surround sound, while watching a slid show of the art from this era of NIN. Not to mention the ability to watch the introductory video in this new series. [And you can also watch the preview/promo commercial for the release of WITH_TEETH]. You go to the screen for viewing the video, then press \\"Left\\" then enter on your remote. The commercial will start, and last for about 30 seconds, not much, but something else for those who complain of the lack of extras. <br />     Now for the music, the best tracks are arguably, EVERY DAY IS EXATLY THE SAME, RIGHT WHERE IT BELONGS, THE HAND THAT FEEDS, ALL THE LOVE IN THE WORLD, ONLY, THE LINE BEGINS TO BLUR. And if you were lucky enough to get your hands on the Japanese Import, HOME, RIGHT WHERE IT BELONGS v.2, THE HAND THAT FEEDS (RUFF MIX), were all excellent songs in my opinion; and gave the album some much needed lengthening, not to mention some alternate takes to two songs. It's just a shame that we have to pay $35 to get them. <br />     This album was of course different from all the rest, and one factor made it sound a lot more organic, Dave Grohl on live drums. Without this, i think, the album would not have the overall power and ferocity that is anchored down to a suitable level so that listeners can feelthe music more; instead of trying to grasp it over and over again [like in \\"Fixed\\"]. <br />     So, one more great album for the ages. And some say this one is just an introduction to his next album already in the works, we'll just have to wait, see, compare. Until then this album draws you in and becomes greater and greater each listening session. So if at first you don't enjoy, give it a try again and again.
0312954468|4.0|About halfway through RIVER GOD, a highly-entertaining novel full of intrigue and detail about how ancient Egyptians thought and lived, I got that sensation of Deja Vu.  Some time ago, I'd read a novel about the life of Hatshepsut, the early woman Pharoah of Egypt, c. 15th Century B.C.  I realized the events concerning the main characters were playing out just as they did in that novel, though the background of the lovely young woman, Lostris, here destined to wed the Pharoah Mamose, despite her love for the young warrior, Tanus, differed from the earlier book I read, in which the future Hatshepsut was the sister of the future Pharaoh.  In each case, however, the heroine bears a child to the warrior, who is believed to be the child of the rightful king, and becomes his heir.  She is then regent while the boy grows up, Pharaoh while the Egyptian dynasty is driven into exile far south down the Nile due to the Hyksos conquest of Upper and Lower Egypt.  By the time the Hyksos with their horses and chariots make mincemeat of the Egyptian army, who have never before seen either wheels or horses, I realized it was much the same plot as the other book. Another key event was identical, involving the disgrace of Intef, the king's vizier, and the manner of discovery of proof of his embezzlement of riches belonging to the Pharaoh. The other book was nowhere near as entertaining, but I wish a reader who picked up the book had been given some clue Wilbur Smith was retelling a story based on the life of Hatshepsut.  She was a real ruler, there is a temple to her in Egypt, etc. History can't be copyrighted, and the story certainly must have been out by any definition of the public domain for thousands of years, but it has spoiled my eager page-turning to realize in advance exactly where this story is headed.  Had I seen some reference to this on the cover or in the reviews, I wouldn't have felt so disappointed, as Wilbur Smith's presentation is so lively and fresh.  As it was, I believed I was reading something entirely...well...new.  Having recently visited the King Tut exhibition in Los Angeles, I realize not a whole lot is actually certain about what archeology knows about much of Egyptian history, who fathered who, etc.  This despite exhaustive excavation and study over more than the last century.  So maybe the events in Hatshepsut's story are based on myth Smith felt free to borrow from, just as perhaps the other author did.  Still, I think it would only have been fair for Smith to give the reader a clue as to the tale the novel  was based on, as his afterward does not mention it either.  Sigh.  Taita was a fascinating if ridiculously gifted narrator, a slave who, to hear him tell it, was in one lifetime responsible for every advancement of science, medicine, art and technology developed in ancient Egypt--a tall order for most readers to swallow, just as it would have been to accomplish. <br />Still Smith is a lively storyteller, and the reader who is new to this legend will thoroughly enjoy it.
B00006RINF|5.0|At first I was skeptical on buying a metal band that is Italian and fronted by a woman, but my worries were set at ease when I saw them at ozzfest.I just couldn't believe how beutiful Cristina Scabbia's voice is, it is probably; no wait, better than alot of pop singers and other female rock singers I.E Amy lee of Evanescence. The band itself is great with great guitars, bass and drums. The male and female vocals mix great in a harmonious balance that is captivating and mezmerizing, how many bands can you say can do this. Thanks to that concert now I am a Cristina Scabbia fan because she is so beutiful, I mean WOW she is hot. To people that say Evanescence is better pick this up and the answers will speak for themself.
B000003TAR|4.0|Kurt Cobain's life in 1993 was about as bleak and stressful as they come: His heroin addiction was crippling him, his relationship with his evil b*tch of a wife was dissipating, and he had the unpleasant task of lugging around his band's superstar status. Playing sold-out stadiums filled with idiotic MTV-whores sure wasn't as fun as the small clubs and punk shows back home in Aberdeen, now was it?<br /><br />Right from the opening lyric of \\"Serve The Servants\\" (teenage angst has paid off well), it's obvious that this is something different: By cutting down on the too-clean production and blantant Pixies worship that plagued many of the songs on \\"Nevermind\\", they created \\"In Utero\\", the best album of their career. The shiny, catchy hard-rock is replaced with a stark \\"setting sun on the last day of your life\\" feel, courtesy of the great Steve Albini's production. Even the 'catchy' songs are grim and foreboding. Make no mistake: this isn't exactly music for cruising down the highway in your '67 Mustang with your buds.<br /><br />On the lone single \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\", you can actually feel the instruments emitting a sense of defeat as Kurt's downbeat guitar riff and sighing voice shuffle onward, into a drum-heavy chorus. \\"All Apologies\\" follows a similar strategy, but this time, it sounds more like a deathblow than a cry for help. Perhaps \\"Rape Me\\" and \\"Milk It\\" are responses to the money-hungry music industry, trying to give the jocks and preps as much exposure to Nirvana as possible. That's at least how I picture it.<br /><br />Although not without it's flaws (several of the later tracks are blurbs that are too short and undeveloped to be considered of much use), this depressing, difficult path is definitely what suited Nirvana the most. Play it on those days when life feels like a hopeless blur. Knowing Kurt's right there beside you is strangely life-affirming.<br /><br />There isn't a doubt in my mind that Courtney Love murdered Kurt (as well as the absolutely beautiful Kristen Pfaff), or that Kurt was showing huge signs of improvement at the time of his death, but \\"In Utero\\" shows that the struggles he faced a few months prior to his demise were real. It's not like anyone else could successfully replicate that formula either: That's why KoRn and Papa Roach, bands that thrive primarily on a fake version of the angst Nirvana displays here, couldn't write a good song to save their lives.<br /><br />Reccommended.ly beautiful Kristen Pfaff), or that Kurt was showing huge signs of improvement at the time of his death, but \\"In Utero\\" shows that the struggles he faced a few months prior to his demise were real.

B000001ED1|4.0|One of Us is not even the best song on the CD- in fact, I would argue it is one of the worst. If you like to shake your booty and give your man a little dance, this is a fantastic CD to help you express yourself. Turn up the volume and sing until you're hoarse.    <br /> <br />St. Theresa, Right Hand Man, Dracula Moon, Ladder, Spider Web, Let's Just Get Naked, Help Me... these are the exceptional songs on the CD- bluesy with soul and heart.  <br /> <br />If you like soul or blues, you'll like this album. If you LOVE soul or blues, you might have to listen to the samples. If you dislike soul and blues, don't waste your time. Check out Spears...
B00008LOS1|5.0|Who's Next is the greatest of the Who's studio releases.  It was truely an album unlike any other in that it was put together like Frankenstein; songs from different origins and parts of Townshend's post-Tommy project, Lifehouse.  The album is composed of recorded, cut, re-recorded, and fine-tuned Lifehouse songs, and one non-Lifehouse song, John Entwistle's dark-humored \\"My Wife\\".  Of all Who albums, the most lasting Who anthems come from Who's Next; the masterful \\"Baba O'Riley\\" (Teenage Wasteland), \\"Bargain\\", the raging \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\", and the musical juggernaut that is \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\".  Although the Lifehouse project was scraped, its soul lives in Who's Next, even more so with this Deluxe Edition, which includes most of the cut Lifehouse songs, not released on the original album in 1971.  Most importantly, \\"Pure & Easy\\", an expression of earlier musical simlpicity, \\"Time Is Passing\\", \\"Too Much of Anything\\", and the alternate versions of \\"Love Ain't For Keeping\\", \\"Getting In Tune\\", \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\", and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\".  The second CD is composed of the Who's April 26th, 1971 Lifehouse performance at The Young Vic Theatre in London, England.  The album only lacks three of the songs performed by the Who that night; Pinball Wizard, See Me, Feel Me, and Bony Moronie.  For the interested, the performance of \\"Bony Maronie\\" from the Young Vic is included on the \\"30 Years of Maximum R&B\\" box set, but sadly, the remaining two songs, taken from Tommy, have never been released on an offical Who record, but is available on the bootleg, \\"Young Vic Blues\\", along with other excepts from the Young Vic Concert.  Overall, this is an essential not just for Who fans, but for any person who has ever listened to a Rock song.  Who's Next defines the bridge between the music of the 1960's and the '70's and beyond.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Let me start by saying that I'm a very big fan of Coldplay and have been since \\"Parachutes\\" was released in the U.S. back in 2000. Since the song \\"Clocks\\" took off a couple years ago, a lot of people jumped on the Coldplay bandwagon. Anyway, take comfort in knowing my opinion on this album is worthy of being heard, because I'm familiar with the band's entire musical catalogue...as opposed to all the ditsy teenage girls that buy their CDs just to listen to a 1 song that the radio wears thin anyway.<br /><br />Ok, when I bought this album, I was really concerned if the band could actually top the creativity that went into \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\". I felt better after hearing \\"Speed of Sound\\", the first single from the new album. It sounded a lot like \\"Clocks\\", but it also had it's own thing going on. I still think this is probably the best song on the album, or at least my favorite. Another favorite of mine is \\"Talk\\", which features guitar work that was unmistakingly inspired by U2. \\"White Shadows\\" also has a U2 feel to it. The album's opener, \\"Square One\\" grows on me more every time I hear it. It sounds like something you should listen to while being in a planetarium. Actually, this whole album has a lot more atmosphere to it than the past 2 albums. There is less acoustic ballads, and more spacey, futuristic sounding songs...which I like. Another really beautiful song on the album is \\"Fix You\\", which singer Chris Martin wrote for his wife Gwenyth Paltrow after her father died. One other song that stood out to me was \\"Low\\", which starts off kinda like \\"Politik\\" and then goes into a verse similar to \\"Moses\\". With the first couple of listens, this CD seemed good, but not great. But I noticed that each time a put it on, a new song would get stuck in my head. So I would put it on again to hear the song, but then the NEXT song would get stuck in my head. So eventually, this album came to be quite addicting. Is it better than \\"Rush Of Blood...\\"? No. But I didn't really expect it to be. Do I still love this album? Yes!ect it to be. Do I still love this album? Yes!
B000002P2W|5.0|The Who By Numbers is an album different from other Who albums.  It is an expression of the angst and inner-feelings of these four aging rockers.  Pete Townshend writes some of his most honest music for this album.  The mellow \\"Blue, Red, and Grey\\" is as far from an rock song ever produced, it rips the seams of the canvas that shielded Pete's true feelings from the world.  Pete and the Who express their questions as to their fame and rock status through songs like \\"How Many Friends\\", \\"They Are All In Love\\", and \\"However Much I Booze\\".  John Entwistle contributes his usual dark humor through his song, \\"Success Story\\".  Keith does some of his best drumming on the album in \\"Dreaming From The Waist\\".  Although The Who are a rock band, this isn't a true rock album, but, nevertheless, a important album to hear to truely understand the previous and following Who albums and the band members themselves.  At it's time of release in 1975, many music critics called it \\"A Suicide Note\\", as it was a 180 Degree turn from the previous Who album, Quadrophenia.  As always, first impressions and opinions aren't always correct; The Who By Numbers now stands as one of greatest look into the live of a rock group.  It is an essential to any Who or Rock fan.
B0000256KE|5.0|Every album Roxy did in the early seventies is very good.  Siren, Country Life, and parts of the debut & Stranded(my personal favorite Roxy song would probably be Sunset) are all brilliant. However, the second one \\"For Your Pleasure\\" is the best and for one reason only: it was their weirdest, wildest, and most experimental, not to mention influential.  Unconventional and different sounding even today this is the one that everyone who thinks all rock music sounds the same should own.  Every song is a winner and there is not a weak minute contained.  It should contain a warning to beware of solo breaks, they are brutal.
B000002P2V|3.0|Who Are You is much different from any other previous Who album in that it's musical composition was more synthesiers than guitar, drums, and bass.  Originally released in 1978, Who Are You is composed of mostly songs that are statements of Pete Townshend; his dislike of the Disco genre (Sister Disco), Musical Composition (Guitar and Pen), and an encounter with an up and coming Punk group, The Sex Pistols, in \\"Who Are You\\", the title track.  Although any Who fan, and most rock fans, are extremely familiar with \\"Who Are You\\", as it is a solid rock anthem, most of the other tracks have been lost behind earlier Who works, such as Who's Next and Tommy.  Unlike other albums, John Entwistle has more of his compositions on Who Are You.  A lack-luster \\"Had Enough\\", a curious look at cloning (905), and \\"Trick of the Light\\".  Who Are You was the last decent Who Studio Album, as Keith Moon died shortly after the album was produced, of an accidental overdose on the medicine prescripted to him to combat his extreme alcoholism.  A very little know fact is that although Keith Moon died shortly after the album was produced, he did play \\"Who Are You\\" live, twice.  The two concerts occurred in Toronto on October 21st, 1976, and the later was the dismal Kilburn Gamount State Concert in 1977, which was setup to produce live performances for \\"The Kids Are Alright\\".  Overall, this album is last studio stand for the Who, before the \\"Kenney Jones Years\\".  If you are a Who fan, buy this album not just for the title track, but for the attempted Punk / Hard Rock Conversion it attempted.
B0002858YS|1.0|I havent even heard this album yet, the 2 songs I have heard on tv have sucked, I mean they are bad, really bad, this band is just another example of how bad music is today, I mean look at the music of today, Frenz Fernidad or whatever they're called, modest mouse...I mean come on, wheres the talent? I would never get this album ever, but the good news is that Rock is on its way back! all these great bands from back in the 80's are all coming back and are gonna blow this crap away. I recommened L.A.Guns-Tales from the strip or Buckcherry's new and upcoming album \\"15\\"

B00070Q7VO|5.0|Fabulous! Fabulous! Did I say fabulous? <br />I can't get his voice out of my head --- and who would? <br />My only suggestion would be to buy more than one copy because you'll want this cd everywhere you go and playing all the time!
B000002UAO|5.0|Although it's not as lauded as later albums, \\"Rubber Soul\\" marks a huge step forward for The Beatles in terms of maturity. Mainly, the lyrical content is more serious. There's still a lot of songs dealing with relationships, but they're delivered in a more mature, introspective way. There's definetly a ton of Bob Dylan influence on this album, as they delve deep into a more folky, artsy sound on many songs. <br /> <br />Paul McCartney's tuneful \\"Drive My Car\\" is a buoyant, can't miss opener with a deliciously catchy chorus. It suggests that \\"Rubber Soul\\" may be a pretty breezy, upbeat album..then, Lennon delivers \\"Norwegian Wood\\", a cryptic folk song which features George Harrison on sitar, giving it a slight indian feel as well.  <br /> <br />However, both Paul and John (and George to a lesser extent at this point) are masters at creating intriguing, catchy melodies in their songs. So stuff that may sound weird on paper still comes across as highly melodic pop. For instance, Lennon's gorgeous, melancholy \\"Nowhere Man\\".  <br /> <br />\\"Nowhere Man\\" isn't Lennon's only downbeat gem on here. He also turns in one of his best songs of all time (if not *the* best) with \\"In My Life\\". The fact that he's dead adds even more weight and emotion to the song. Everything from the verses to the harmonies to George Martin's piano solo in the middle is just perfect. <br /> <br />For the most part, Paul's songs sound much more upbeat (which was the case for all the Beatles albums). \\"If I Needed Someone\\" and \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" are both blissfully perfect pop songs, with a shimmering, jangly feel throughout. Very Byrds-y. <br /> <br />He also turns in a minor key gem with \\"Michelle\\", as does John Lennon with \\"Girl\\". These lush, intricate melodies are far removed from what The Beatles were doing even a year prior to this.  <br /> <br />Other highlights include the anthematic \\"The Word\\", George Harrison's folksy \\"If I Needed Someone\\" (which also recalls The Byrds), the urgent \\"Wait\\", and the country-ish \\"What Goes On\\", in which Ringo Starr takes lead vocals. <br /> <br />Maybe not as mindblowing as \\"Revolver\\" or \\"Sgt. Pepper\\", but \\"Rubber Soul\\" is just as essential.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|I had to buy it to get my Buble fix and it's worth the bucks to anyone who enjoys Michael Buble, actually for anyone who enjoys listening to good music. Buble is so funny. You'll laff when you hear 'how he's going to take over the world' with love. What a sense of humor!
B0006GAI6O|4.0|For those of us who have recently discovered the joys of ballroom dancing, the feelings expressed in this movie cover the whole range of what we went through: feeling of guilt, surprise at the \\"comic\\" mimics and posture of the professional dancers, discovery of the difference of expectations between a ballroom class and a disco, and above all, the wonderful sensation of getting off the ground and moving to those great musics. The movie is therefore an invitation to the rest of you who have no idea or are just intrigued by it, to get inside a ballroom class and let go! It is so nice to have the plot and these great actors, Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon, play it down to let dancing be the star. I loved the deleted scenes that you can only see on the DVD (versus the theatre movie). Stanley Tucci is such a versatile actor: a dark professional hitman in the Pelican Brief, and this Mr Jekyll/Doctor Hyde dancer with so much fun in his attitude here. The two other male actors became such good dancers after practicing for this movie, that it gives hope to all of us! Jennifer Lopez is also served by her excellent dancing. And Lisa Ann Walter as the blunt talking Bobbie is so much fun and dances so well. The whole thing is so enjoyable, you can watch it with your kids. Hopefully, it will get more boys and men to learn dancing and stop thinking: \\"this is for girls\\"... Who will dance with the girls if they don't learn it???!!! And \\"chicks LOVE dancing!\\" as Lisa Ann Walter says...
B00009RAJI|4.0|Now that title may seem deceiving and it is meant to be. The difference between this Mac, Mac I and Mac II is galaxies apart. Truthfully I prefer the blues of the original Mac to this but how could I not own one of the best selling albums ever. If what you're looking for is almost perfect pop or '70's pop then this is it. Even Mac II with Bob Welch lends something of a more raw sound than this. That said, listening to this in 2005 gives it a much different sound than 30 years ago. Then the singles, including Silver Springs, were all over the radio and it was played to death. Today the guitars, the rythym section, and the vocals blend together even better than yesterday. The internal turmoil of the band produced some of the most wonderful, angry and hurt songs ever recorded. I know this all seems to be pretty convoluted but I guess you have to have lived, loved, and been thrown away to appreciate it all.
1577312082|5.0|Although I have not read the book and have only heard the audio version, I can imagine that the book might seem repetitive. The audio version is stunning. It does not seem repetitive in the least, but nuanced and thorough in its elucidation of the unique state of presence. It is apparent that he speaks from what he knows intimately. His voice is compassionate, resonant--and the act of listening itself becomes an exercise in being present. <br />Forget about the book, listen to the cds for the opportunity to be present in the voice of Eckhart Tolle.
B00000K0E5|5.0|There are two Bond movies that I hold above the others: The Living Daylights, which was my first ever Bond experience, and GoldenEye, which along with the popular N64 videogame really got me hooked on Bond mania.<br /><br />This is still the strongest of the Brosnan-era Bond films. It has a very strong story with lots of memorable action set pieces and an excellent cast, while never being overshadowed by the multiple explosions and pyrotechnics that have dominated the newer entries. What really seperates GoldenEye from other Bond movies, in my opinion, is how the Bond girls and supporting characters are given personalities and histories that exist outside Bond's world. Whereas most of the films introduce the girls as Bond meets them, here we get scenes of Natalya and her hacker co-worker Boris before they are entangled in the GoldenEye conspiracy. This gives the characters more depth and adds another layer to the story. Sean Bean gives a strong turn as a 00-agent turned villain, and Famke Janssen pretty much made this her break-out role. Really, the only possible quibble is Brosnan himself, who in retrospect is still somewhat green as Bond. But this is of course his first film, and his performance still easily calls to mind the perfect mix of the previous Bond actors. It's easy to see why he's become second favourite after Connery.<br /><br />This is a strong DVD, loaded with commentaries and an archive of tv spots and trailers. I do wish they'd included more GoldenEye-specific documentaries instead of the general \\"World of 007\\" special that aired on tv, but it's still fun. Definitely one of the top five Bond movies for me, and a perfect rebirth of the franchise after the six-year hiatus.
B000002GQE|5.0|1967 was a watershed moment in pop music, as the broad horizons of the post-Pet Sounds landscape beckoned to bands like The Beatles, The Moody Blues, Pink Floyd, The Rolling Stones and many others. Each went off in their own directions, Pink Floyd in pursuit of the ultimate sonic acid splash, The Beatles to perfect Britpop in the studio, and the Moodies to make a classical pop record. (The Stones, for their part, tripped and took a noisy tumble down the hill.) <br /> <br />While some of the original gilding still shines on Days of Future Passed, the psychedelic precocity of its intent has left a patina that obscures some of the fine handiwork involved in its painstaking fabrication. The London Festival Orchestra, conducted by Peter Knight, might have been the subtle salting needed to bring these songs a better flavor, but mostly it places the Moodies in the middle of Pepperland (though they did arrive there first). The spoken poetry, introduced here for the first time, is the height of pretension, invoking Helios in a Homeric summoning of the dawn as if the sun shined out of their art. And yet, it's this ambitious pretense to music as classical art that makes Days so compelling. <br /> <br />Much of what the Moodies reach for is simply beyond their grasp; \\"Dawn Is A Feeling\\" and \\"Another Morning\\" are mawkish attempts to merge classical and pop themes. But no amount of failure can diminish the album's great achievement: \\"Nights In White Satin.\\" This was, and remains, one of pop music's most sublime victories, invoking a majesty that elevated the medium in an instant from popular voice to artistic expression. Not to be overlooked is \\"Forever Afternoon (Tuesday?),\\" which introduced the mellotron into the Moodies music and achieved much the same effect as Nights without the strings. The remainder of the record has its moments, \\"Peak Hour\\" (despite its remarkably shrill chorus) and \\"Twilight Time\\" among them. At this early stage, Justin Hayward's songs carry the day, while John Lodge and Ray Thomas (whose affection for Eastern sounds here suggests an affinity with George Harrison) search for a suitable muse. That would all be in the past, though, as the Moodies looked forward to a new future where each songwriter found their own voice. It was indeed a new day dawning for the Moodies and for pop music in general. Not bad for a day's work.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I personally love Carole King's voice, and her voice really shines through on this album. I have been listening to Carole for years, (my mom originally got me listening to her), and I still really like her. I feel the lyrics are very good, and really relate to real life. I like all the songs, but I especially like \\"I feel the earth move\\", \\"It's too late\\" and \\"Where you lead\\". I also really like that  her song \\"where you lead\\"  was used as the theme song to the the WB's hit show Gilmore Girls (which is my favorite show!), she actually changed it some, and shortened it, but it's just as good as the original song- and she sings it with her daughter (that's always a bonus to have a mother-daughter duo). This is a great CD for people of all ages- whether you're 8, or 48, this is a definite must-have for all Carole King music lovers!

B00007B8PF|3.0|As diehard AC/DC fans are aware of, the \\"High Voltage\\" album that was originally released in the US in 1976 is NOT their honest-to-goodness debut album.  The original \\"High Voltage\\" album came out in Australia in February of 1975, and the subsequent US album of the same title only includes 2 of the same tracks, with 4 additional tracks from the Australian version later turning up on the \\"'74 Jailbreak\\" release.    So, what we have here is a CD issue of AC/DC's true debut album.  It's been said again and again over the years how all AC/DC's music sounds the same, and although that's a justified statement, their music did evolve a fair bit in the '70s, and this debut album does sound rather tentative.    On the one hand, yes, the boys do have their trademark sound more or less nailed down already with this record.  Bon Scott's wailing vocals, Angus Young's fluid guitar soloing, and the crunching dual rhythm guitars are all on display.  So what makes this album different?  Well, for one thing, there's a song that honestly qualifies as a BALLAD, and NOT a blues ballad along the lines of \\"Ride On\\" or \\"Night Prowler\\"--it's the tepid \\"Love Song\\" which actually features acoustic guitar!  Granted, a love ballad featuring acoustic guitar was hardly a radical idea in and of itself, but this is AC/DC for crying out loud.    The main problem here is simply that the material isn't that strong.  Angus and Malcolm clearly had a way to go at this point before becoming masters of hard rock riffs.  \\"Show Business\\" is a dull boogie-rock number with corny background vocals.  \\"She's Got Balls\\" is pretty grating with dull riffage, and it's quite tedious with its slow tempo and close-to-5-minutes running time.  \\"Little Lover\\" has nice licks, but again, it drags and grates, with annoying lyrics, and a shockingly long false ending.  The boys sound like they're afraid to really cut loose on \\"Stick Around\\" which gives the song a tentative feel despite the great guitar tone and a nice bluesy feel.  \\"You Ain't Got A Hold On Me\\" does have catchiness and uses a simple-but-effective drum fill, but again, they sound like they're holding back, to tentative effect.  \\"Soul Stripper\\" is quite good though, with cool licks, a simple-but-effective 2-note bass line, plus an extended instrumental intro featuring woodblock and congas, also unusual instruments for an AC/DC record.  And there's no denying that the fast-paced cover of \\"Baby, Please Don't Go\\" rocks big time--it's clearly influenced by Them's version, but it's much more exciting, and although Bon does get a little carried away with his screaming on it, it's still quite a blast.    So, in retrospect, this is a promising album from AC/DC that has its moments, but it's mostly for diehard fans only.
B000002MTR|4.0|I see all this bitching about this album...but if you think about it this album was just a rough time in all of the member's lives. It's definitely different from Blood Sugar Sex Magic, but there will never be an Album like that ever again. It sucks that John's not in the group because he's got to be one of the greatest guitarists of all time, but with out this time in their lives there could possibly not be Chili Peppers around, and I, for one, would not be able to live in a world where the Red Hot Chili Peppers did not exsist. Rock on!
B000002UAU|5.0|This is a recording packed with loads of good old fashioned Beatle lore.  Paul-is-dead-lore, The Beatles are the next Mozarts lore, The Beach Boys scared the Beatles back into the studios lore (this is true...just ask Sir Paul McCartney, who is of course alive and well, thank you very much, and on his gazillionteenth tour with Lady Heather and baby Bea in tow)...and in the Days of Vinyl it took turns being called \\"the greatest\\" along with \\"Abbey Road\\".  Being knee-high to a cicadid when the Beatles were at their height, but nonetheless a huge fan, I knew them from AM radio, not albums.  So I never knew which songs were on which lps until high school, when our team-tought humanities instructors (see my \\"So You'd Like to be a Pseudo-Expert in Western Culture\\" list) gave their infamous \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" Lecture!  Aha, thinks I, This is An Important Record!<br /><br />And it was.  Many thought it was the first album with a theme (although Brian Wilson's \\"Pet Sounds\\" beat the Beatles to that punch). And \\"the boys\\" continued to show influences as far flung as British music-hall and Indian classical music.  Put together, it was nothing less than delightful.  And just think, it was sixty years ago today, or something like that....
B0006IIPIK|5.0|Great movie, Super Special Effects. The extra features were very interesting. Must see for the Action/Adventure movie fan.
B00005JN5X|3.0|Not a bad movie it was just very very disjointed.  Some of the special effects were very cool but when you stop being awed by the cinematography and take a step back you realize how shoddy the construction of this movie is.  Plot threads lead everywhere and were never really effectively resolved.  There was no chemistry between any of the actors, every single person in the cast played their roles sort of tongue and check like they were expecting the other person to bust out laughing.   <br /> <br />The movie would not annoy me so much if not for the moronic choice of villains.  I can forgive wooden acting to a certain extent I cannot forgive wooden pointless villains.  Any time the plot actually threatened to break into new territory one of the idiotic villains would show up and ruin the moment.  If these guys were supposed to scare me or make me root for the Brothers why was I rolling my eyes when the bad guys said their lines?  Why use French people as the main point of conflict in the movie?  A lot of things in this movie don't make a whole not of sense but this is probably the biggest point.   <br /> <br />Bottom line-Not good, not awful I don't hate myself for watching it in the theater but I am certainly not wasting my time with it ever agian.   <br />
0439679958|5.0|I read this book In 2 days and It really was the best book I have ever read. It had a great blend of action, horror, and  suspense. I think that was the first book that actually kept me up until 1:00 in the morning. Ravens gate grabs you by your collar on the first page. If it were a movie, I would guess it would probably be rated PG-13 because of horror, and some graphical images (there is an execution at the end). I would definatly reccomend this book to anyone who likes horror as much as me. Ravens Gate is the best!
0786715103|5.0|This is the first book on any genocide that I have read and I dont think I have the stomach to read any thing else. As I read the General's detailed account of almost each day in hell, I was shocked, angry,restless,bitter,poignant and totally bewildered as I just could not fathom that a genocide of such enormous proportions was let to \\"happen\\" by the World(the so called protectors of humankind, the Western World in particular). General Dallaire lambasts this hyprocricy in his own professional way but you can feel the guilty feeling in him too as in pages after pages he ruminates that he was not doing enough or he has not done enough or he could not do enough to stop this massacre.<br /><br />The General starts off by explaining how he came to be in the army in the first place and by these accounts you really get to know the man that he is: brave, outspoken, smart, and sometimes a touch arrogant.In the next part he writes about the harrowing times during the actual \\"peacekeeping process\\" in which day after day he sends cables to the UN for more troops, food, logistics,supplies but to no avail. This is most frustrating part of the book, I almost feel like the General is wasting pages by giving us accounts of his daily lives before the genocide, but after reading the book I feel for him and his troops. They were deserted by the world and their countries. They were told to keep the peace with almost next to nothing. But hats off to General Dallaire for keeping the unit intact despite the terrible shortcomings of the UN and the US in particular. When he writes about the accounts of the war- the barbaric and senseless killings, the stench and the smell,the journey to insanity - you just realise how petty your life is and how me and you are so apathetic to the problems of this world. When he writes to say that he saw\\" children slaughtering children, women with babies on their backs killing women with babies on their back\\", you can only gasp in horror for this utter disdain for human life. At another instance he writes that \\" As we sat down , we saw a strange creature coming towards us, it was not a dog though it was of the same size, but in fact an overblown rat which had feasted on the living and the dead\\". Believe it or not I literally threw the book away as I read that sentence. I still get shivers thinking about it. General Dallaire and his troops got to see such horrendous accounts of carnage and death and he desrcibes it in a clear and lucid manner as he wants the world to get a feeling of how such a dastardly act might look like.In the end I have nothing but my sincere respect for General Dallaire for here was a person who was betrayed by the rest of the world and who had the option of backing off but he didnt and saved the lives of thousands if not millions.<br /><br />I wish I could have done something for the people of Rwanda and I wish this tragedy would never have happened. I can still do a lot of things, we all can contribute something, but we are so absorbed in our selfish lives that after a week of reading this book we will go about our lives as if nothing has happened and that is the saddest and most apalling part.in for human life.

B00008PX8P|5.0|This two disc DVD set is simply incredible. I have always enjoyed listening to Led Zeppelin, so being able to view their past concert performances makes the overall experience even better.
B000063UR2|4.0|Ridley Scott's \\"Legend,\\" like \\"Dragonslayer\\" before it and \\"Labyrinth\\" that succeeded it, had the misfortune of being released at a time when films of fantasy took a back seat to the outer space battles of the respective \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Star Trek\\" film.  Had the aforementioned films been released during today's friendlier fantasy times, after the box office successes of \\"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy\\" and the Harry Potter films, they probably would've fared better at the box office.<br /><br />Though not a great film, \\"Legend\\" does have a couple of good things going for it.<br /><br />First off, it offers a look at a truly innocent Tom Cruise, not the superstar or scientology advocate or psycho-blabbler that we've come to love, but a genuine star on the rise.  He looks as fresh and wide-eyed as...say Katie Holmes...just right for the role of an forest-dwelling innocent that must restore the world order after his beloved princess (Mia Sara) makes an error in judgment.<br /><br />Secondly, the film has a unique look, so characteristic of Scott's film.  Listening to the director's commentary is a fascinating experience as he tells how he achieved that look under tight budgetary constraints and a studio mishap.<br /><br />Thirdly, the restored Jerry Goldsmith score is a auditory treat.  The \\"Dress Waltz\\" is one of Goldsmith's most riveting pieces and the entire score ranks as one of his best of his later compositions. It is baffling as to why the \\"suits\\" decided to discard the composer's work in exchange for the avant garde yet boring Tangerine Dream score.<br /><br />And finally, Tim Curry is brilliant as the \\"Lord of Darkness\\". Although hidden under layers of make-up (to give him his menacing and muscular appearance), the actor's vivid portrayal illuminates every scene in which he appears.  It's a shame that the film's short running time didn't allow for more screen time for the gifted actor.
0930289528|5.0|if you're considering buying this book, know one thing: its not an action story.  dont expect high flying machine gun blazing antics from V, a point where Evey picks up a machine gun, yells \\"for father!\\" and plows down 50 some odd police officers, or anything else of the sort.  the story is a tale of a dystopian Britain, a facist government now facing down an anti-hero, anarchist vigilante named \\"V\\".  If you enjoy the sort of story with a lot of comparison between two \\"evils\\"- facism and anarchy, or the tale of Guy Fawkes, or are a fan of Moore's other work (or George Orwell's 1984), this book will probably suit you well.  be warned, however, there are relatively few \\"action\\" sequences, and the movie will have to stray far from the book to make it a fall blockbuster action movie.

B00005JNTX|5.0|Sin City, quite frankly, is not for the squeamish or faint of heart. This film is almost impossibly violent, with cannibalism, decapitation, dismemberment, castration, and torture occuring throughout the three major segments. However, anyone who has ever actually read the source material would not complain. The action is frequently over-the-top and unrealistic, but it makes sense when one considers that this is a \\"translation\\" of Frank Miller's graphic novels. Most of Sin City's dialogue and voiceovers are lifted right out of the comics, as are many individual shots. Three loosely-connected storylines make up the bulk of the film, beginning with \\"The Hard Goodbye,\\" continuing with \\"The Big Fat Kill,\\" and ending with \\"That Yellow Bastard.\\"  <br /> <br />The cast is simply excellent: Mickey Rourke brings the thuggish Marv to brutal, excessively-bandaged life; Benicio Del Toro's Jackie Boy exudes half-crazed menace; Nick Stahl's performance as Junior perfectly conveys the character's bratty psychosis. Even non-speaking characters are well-played (Elijah Wood is downright creepy as the murderous Kevin). <br /> <br />I really don't understand the accusations of misogyny. Most of the women are strong-willed and powerful, like Gail, Wendy, and Miho. The men of Sin City are almost always portrayed as callous, amoral killers. Well, technically, everyone in Sin City is somewhat lacking in morality. Anyone easily offended by immoral behavior should rent or buy a different movie.
B000005JA8|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut wrote some of the best classics for the sixties generation, and he did it with a more probable cause than making a Cat's Cradle a drug-mythic-apocalypse road through a thick fog of interpretation and LSD like journeys. That book, and Captain Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica, lie on a similar course of arrangement. Whereas the main points should be refined from piece to piece, the two take extraordinary means to twist the old into some new, wonderful, beautiful creature. Which, if you didn't know, is what Miles Davis did. <br />Like a dark tornado of beastly arrangement, the slick artistry churns everything into this extrapolated part, a song. The main theme is NEVER lost, but it turns you to this new world where bat-chain-pullers and radio-station men take xynthols and laser beams to mind when walking on a friday morning. KEEP IN HIGH MIND! They, the magic band, rehearsed this for twelve months in a house with blacked out windows, after Beefheart had written and composed a lot of the album in less than a few hours. It is remarkable that this would come out of such heartache. Some would probably wonder how in the world they came upon this sound. I'll guess at you. <br />The evolution of the Beefheart sound starts with him trying at bands and albums too eccentric for the early sixties. He was, as you all know, a student in the same school of Frank Zappa somewhere in a desert in around Southern California. Before that he had been a failed art student with clay, having turned down a great promise to go learn in Europe with the masters at age thirteen. Again, remarkable and instrumental in figuring upon his genius at a young age, since so many find it difficult to understand now. Music labels were not kind to Beefheart, duly named for sounding just like the blues legend Howlin' Wolf, and being very white. You can hear an early song of his on the nuggets compilation-dIDDY-wAH-dIDDy; it sounds similar to every other song within Nuggets. An irate \\"screw you\\" toconformity by being just like everyone else and recording a psychedelic single-weren't the sixties great?!  <br />Well, anyways, this grew into Safe as Milk-a real album, and The Mirror Man Sessions. Those offer much greater lead upon the eventual sound of Beefheart and his magic band: Everlasting atrophy; growing Mississippi blues doused in Gris-Gris voodoo all the way from New Orleans. In these early stages, they turn old southern classics into twenty minute songs. This practice with playing for long periods of time would come to make the Magic Band out of dust, scum, and fire-from the depths of Cali. <br />Then, suddenly, everything morphed into this gigantic monster that went terrificaly right! Practice and rehearsal got the magic band in form, while the Captain lost his @!$%!@#$ mind. CB is best only when manic and criminally original. Frank Zappa was producing this one, and whenever Frank touches anything, his iconoclastic views normally add a composure, rythm, and overall weirdness that's really catchy. So it was a spledid plan to be able to record the album in a very limited amount of time-had they all not rehearsed so much, it would have taken a year. <br />Then, during the release of the album, Zappa supposedly marketed Beefheart as a freak, and Beefheart went into nothingness for five whole years. The two did not come together again until, I believe, Bongo Fury. CB went on to make other albums, of course, but none were so spectacular as this genius, masterpiece of art and sound.  <br />Psychadelica at its best. <br />P.s. By the way, was that really Matt Groening down there? The voice sounds right, and he would have been old enough to have seen beefheart. I think it is. Just Wonderin'.
B00006DEFA|2.0|This is painful for me on two counts: in general I am a big fan of director's cuts, and \\"Amadeus\\" is one of my favorite films of all time.  But not this \\"Amadeus.\\"  I am obliged to politely disagree with those who feel the added scenes contributed in any way.  Rather, they bog down the story and keep threatening to send the plot scampering away on wild rabbit chases.  As much as I like Christine Ebersole, her expanded scene following the \\"Seraglio\\" performance adds nothing, absolutely nothing, and weakens the effect achieved so chillingly with one baleful glance in the theatrical release.   <br /> <br />The worst blunder is the added scene between Salieri and Constanze.  I have no idea what Schaffer and Forman were thinking even to script and film it.  This is a variation on a key scene in the stage play.  There, it brilliantly showed Salieri's conflicted and tortured soul: with Constanze more predatory, it further developed the character of Salieri as God's victim.  Here, it has been rewritten in a way that only makes him look sadistic, and to an utterly innocent non-combatant in his war with God.  The only thing this scene contributes is a nice chill to Constanze's later line \\"I regret we have no servants to show you out.\\"  Oh, and snag a completely gratuitous R rating. <br /> <br />Other scenes have some value in showing Salieri's conspiracies to isolate Mozart in society and ruin him financially.  But they are eddies, backwaters that ultimately drag the story and momentum down.  It's almost as if the theatrical release achieved what F. Murray Abraham's Salieri said about Mozart's music: displace one phrase, and there would be diminution.  That's what this cut is. <br /> <br />Most disappointing of all are the \\"extras,\\" which are surprisingly lean and uninformative for such a landmark film.  There is only one commentary (author Peter Schaffer and director Milos Forman), and even that is full of prolonged silences interspersed with banal, unrevealing chatter. <br/> <br />Okay, I've seen it.  Now I'll be selling it and returning to the vigor, pace, scripting and complex but perfectly woven plot lines of the theatrical release.
B0006B29Z2|5.0|Having been an Iron Maiden fan for the better part of two decades, I have to say this DVD delivered waaaaayyyy more than I ever expected.  From the production quality to the historical content, this disc is a full blown keeper!!  Take it from someone who's banged his head to these brutal Brits since he was only twelve.  If you fancy yourself a fan, buy this DVD.  You will not be disappointed.  I cannot wait until the next installment of this series hits the shelves.  This disc made it all the more clear that it'll take a lot more than the abuse these guys suffered at Ozzfest in California this year to put them down for the count.  The beast that is Maiden is a class act that just won't quit!  Up the Irons!!
B00009RAJH|5.0|The decision of Mick Fleetwood and John McVie to abandon Fleetwood Mac's blues-rock heritage to merge with the California soft-rock duo of Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks, with Christine McVie serving as the bridge between the two, is one of the more inexplicable masterstrokes in the history of popular music. The only thing that would have been stranger is if somehow things had been different enough that the two members for whom Fleetwood Mac was named had been the ones that departed rather than the pair that stayed the whole way through.<br /><br />Fleetwood and McVie had never been the creative driving force behind their group, and it was Lindsey Buckingham and his devotion to the same sort of meticulously arranged music of the Beatles and the Beach Boys that created the Supergroup of the late 1970s. More than anything else it was the exquisite harmonies that gave the new and improved Fleetwood Mac its distinctive and popular sound. Buckingham's vision would come to fruition on \\"Rumours,\\" where he was clearly the dominate force in terms of the songwriting, either by himself or in concert with the rest of the group. But on this self-titled 1975 debut album, it is really Christine McVie who shines forth.<br /><br />Buckingham opens the album with \\"Monday Morning\\" to make it crystal clear that Fleetwood Mac is now something completely different and closes with \\"I'm So Afraid,\\" and Nicks has the two fan favorites with her witchy \\"Rhiannon\\" and the elegantly simple ballad \\"Landslide.\\"  But McVie has her best pop-soul songs ever with her hits \\"Over My Head\\" (#20) and \\"Say You Love Me\\" (#11) (\\"Rhiannon\\" also hit #11 on the pop singles chart off of this album). Actually, that is a pretty decent balance between the old and the new for this first time out. The only real reason to mark this album down is that clearly \\"Rumours\\" is so much better. But if you compare \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" to what else was coming out in 1975 instead of the group's high water mark, then it stands up pretty well (at least a 4.5 and every reason to round up). Nobody else was singing harmonies like this, and when the group got back together for \\"The Dance\\" it was like they had never stopped singing together. This album hit #1 in 1976, which was 197 places better than the first \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" album by Fleetwood Mac did in 1968.  So much for the verdict of history.ds up pretty well (at least a 4.5 and every reason to round up).

B00005AQE8|5.0|This is probably 2pac's most popular cd. Every girl I ever dated had this record, I mean its unbelievable. A little story, when this came out my boy drove me up to the store on a snowy day to get this, and on the way home his car almost slid off the bridge. But when I got home and put this in and heard the words I wont deny it im a straight rida you don't wanna f*** wit me got the police bustin at me, but they cant do nothin to a G and then the beat came on and I forgot all about the accident. This is the best double cd in rap ever. Probably his best cd, I mean look at the hits. How Do You Want It, I Aint Mad At Cha(his best video), 2 Of Amerika's Most with Snoop rappin his a** off, Of course California Love (probably his 2nd most played radio song today), All About U. Then U got the underground classics, Ambitionz Az A Ridda, Thug Passion, No More Pain, Picture Me Rollin, and Heartz of Men. What people have to remember when they rate this is that Pac and Dre put this album together in like a week. This album is more about Tupac having fun and its more thuggish then any of his others. It's somethin for everybody on this album, from Wonda Why They Call U b**** to Life Goes On to Run Tha Streetz to We Aint Hard To Find. And one of my personal favorites Heaven Aint Hard To Find. There's also some more of Pac predicting his death on Aint Hard To Find he spits, \\"I heard a rumor I died murdered in cold blood dramatized, pictures of me in my final stage you know imma cry, but that was fiction some cowards got the story twisted, like I no longer existed mysteriously missing\\". If you dont have this cd get it, This and Me Against The World are the best rap cds ever.
B000002TYX|5.0|OK. FREE AS A BIRD  is a fine song, near perfect, but the thumping drums are its one serious flaw, for this old time (40 year) Beatles buff. After this late Lennon piece, are many interesting and unique tunes and interviews/shows of mixed quality. MY BONNIE and AINT SHE SWEET, two really old songs, hold up well as early rockers, and the band gets into some nice grooves on each. The British TV Variety show segment features THIS BOY, I WANNT HOLD YOUR HAND, and a very amusing skit with the show's MC's, one calling Ringo \\"Bongo\\". A nifty photo of this show is included, and the linear notes are all top notch.A waltz version of I'LL BE BACK may be the most interesting number here, radically different than the version we are used to. AND I LOVE HER,a very famous early love tune, also is done as a near-rocker, with Ringo thumping along the beat, another very different style. ONE AFTER 909, recorded much later, sounds better here than on the late 33 RPM version. TILL THERE WAS YOU really shows their fine balladeering, led by Paul, in this terrific live version. And we are treated to John's famous \\"Rattle Your Jewelry\\" line before the command performance of TWIST AND SHOUT, not one of their better songs. Some joking is in order during the recording of NO REPLY,and CANT BUY ME LOVE is given a totally different harmonic style than in the famous single release. I'LL GET YOU, one of their best \\"B\\" sides is done live in an acoustic version ,not as good as the better known version. And there are nice versions of SHE LOVES YOU, MONEY, LONG TALL SALLY, YOU CANT DO THAT, and others, pretty similar to the later recorded versions. So, all in all, an excellent,perfectly packaged CD with about all you might want, if you would like to hear the alternate versions of early hits, and earlier unrecorded songs.
B000007MVM|5.0|But I do.  That's what matters.  If you like long droning guitar solos and 20 minute songs that should have lasted 3 at most, go buy Dark SIde of the Moon.  Syd was great.  I beleive him to be a genious.  He was great, and it's even better that the songs can develope a meaning for you personally and not what some crappy book or half assed webaite says.  Buy it if you liked Piper.  If not, don't bother.
B000001FRY|3.0|After several spins, I find myself enjoying this vibrant U2 album.  Who is U2?  They're four Irish lads with great musical talent.   <br /> <br />I first heard \\"Boy\\" at the record shop I frequent.  Gary, the totally awesome manager of Spins, Tins and Grins Vinyl on campus, had this record playing one day when I was in there looking for Blondie's newest LP.  I couldn't help but be sucked in to the sounds of \\"Boy\\" filling up the well-worn shop.   <br /> <br />The first thing you notice about U2 is the singer.  He has a good voice and sings with a lot of passion.  My understanding is that he cares a great deal about world politics and the ongoing Catholic/Protestant war in his homeland of Ireland.  His energy toward seeking peace, understanding and reconciliation with senseless violence is admirable.  For that, he is to be commended. <br /> <br />The second thing I notice about this upstart new wave rock band is the guitar player.  He doesn't play riffs exactly, not in the same manner as someone like, say, Eddie Van Halen, but he does play atmospheric chiming that sets the mood of songs and becomes quite infectious.  He provides lots of melody and atmosphere to U2's brand of really tubular new wave sounds.   <br /> <br />I don't know much about bass and drums, but the bass sound is pretty prominent in parts when I blast my Panasonic stereo.  Likewise, the drumming is also good.   <br /> <br />Whether this band is accepted by the public definitely remains to be seen.  Will the U.S. embrace such a modern, politically driven agenda?  My guess is that the band will ruin it for themselves and eventually break up.  I gather that the boys in U2 are somewhat shy, and the lead singer is particularly reticent to face the press.   <br /> <br />One more thing to mention: I think side 2 of \\"Boy\\" bests side 1 by just a smidgen.  Listen and judge for yourself.   <br /> <br />Well, I'm off to play Pac Man...enjoy!

B0009I7NNA|5.0|I got this Avenged Sevenfold cd because I heard part of the song Bat Country on Fuse one day and I am a big Fear and Loathing fan so I thought what the hell and got it. This has become one of my favorite cds in my collection and has made me a huge A7X fan. I acually saw them at Warped Tour this year and had the chance to meet them.They were without a dought the best band there and really cool guys. <br /> <br />  Some of my favorite tracks are \\"Bat Country\\" an ode to the late \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" writer Hunter S. Thompson. I really liked \\"Trashed and Scattered\\" as well. <br />And the \\"Seize the Day\\" slower song is sweet as hell too. The whole cd is just amazing so do yourself a favor and pick this up now! <br /> <br />  I didn't even now about the whole M. Shadows blowing a vocal chord until a few weeks ago and it did even change how I feel about this incredible band,I feel he's doing his best if not better to make it work for A7X. I think it's a retarded reason to not like the band or cd anymore. <br /> <br />  I'd say don't stop with this one buy  Waking the Fallen and Sounding the Seventh Trumpet as well....Avenged Sevenfold are simply amazing and I recommend them to everyone!! <br />  <br />                ZaNe

0618526412|5.0|Reputations! Some so portenuous that the mere title bristles with their scent. Such is, The heart Is a Lonely Hunter, a killer title that has become an inherited cliche, absorbed into mainstream language.It is timeless and gripping. You can sense kinship with, 'To Kill a Mockingbird', and the more florid Cormac McCarthy's, 'Suttree'. It's realisation of ambivalent, struggling, and confounded people is so complete that some of the social economic reforms, petitioned between the covers, would have to actualise before its impact paled to irrelevance. The pace is unhurried. The weather necessarily imposes itself on the lives of its fistful of characters. And as they saunter and scrape through a year, mostly perplexed and projecting their anxieties on the mute, Singer, (an ironic nomenclature) the plot waxes and wanes for each of them. The injustices of power and wealth distribution are given vent by the most driven, most outsiderish two men, who find peace and consolation in the company of the mute. Their political and spiritual impotence at first pulls them close, then segregates them, ideologically and racially. The random violence that so rudely grooves their destinies is casually evoked: dramas to be sure, but absorbed in a literary consciousness that has no urge to moralise or proselytize. It's a remarkable book, if for this alone; its lack of pretension. And, in its very ordinariness it both attains and retains the dignity of its vivid life.
0395389496|5.0|My two yr old loves this book for one thing:  It starts off about a train.<br /><br />It's a nice story. Not sure kids of any young age will understand, but not all books to be read and loved have to make since to the audience.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|\\"It's not who I am underneath that counts. It's what I do that makes the difference.\\"<br /> - Batman consoles Rachel Dawes, as Gotham City's legacy of corruption ends & \\"Batman Begins\\"<br /><br />\\"Batman Begins\\" is the best \\"Batman\\" film, to date & is also one of the best films of 2005. Christopher Nolan takes the source material and does something Tim Burton & Joel Schumacher could never do... delivering a worthwhile \\"Batman\\" you actually care about.<br /><br />After witnessing the murder of his parents, at the hands of thug, Joe Chill, a young Bruce Wayne is taken care of by the family butler, Alfred Pennyworth.<br /><br />Fast forward roughly a decade later as Bruce Wayne returns to Wayne Manor, leaving college, to watch & see if Joe Chill recieves an early release from prison after ratting out Gotham mob boss, Carmine Falcone. When Chill is released, Bruce finds out that the Gotham City he grew up with, has changed into an evil corrupt hellhole run by the mob. His point is proven as a newly freed Chill is shot in cold-blood on the courthouse steps, thanks from hired thugs payed off by Falcone.<br /><br />Disillusioned, Bruce searches the world for a way to fight injustice. Trying to learn & understand the criminal underworld Bruce is caught as a thief & lands up in a Chinese prison where he meets a mysterious man by the name of Ducard. Ducard offers Bruce a chance to learn what he has been looking for. Bruce accepts his offer & meets Ducard's master, Ras Al Ghul, a sorcerer & extensive master in many martial & mental arts, who has trained Ducard in his ways.<br /><br />Taken under Ducard's wing, & through extensive & arduous training both mentally (Bruce has to learn to face his fear) as well as physically, Bruce becomes what he had so longed for. But, everything comes with a price & Bruce finds out the true meaning of his training. After passing his final test, Bruce is given an ultimatum. Either, commit his life to serving Ras Al Ghul as a member of his League Of Shadows & help destroy Gotham City, or die. Bruce makes his choice & dedicates his life to saving Gotham City.<br /><br />Once back in Gotham & with the help of Alfred, Bruce begins to search for items that can help him in aiding his fight on crime. Through his father's former company (now Bruce's), Wayne Enterprises, Bruce finds Lucious Fox, an old friend of his father's who is glad to help him out.<br /><br />\\"Does it come in black?\\"<br /><br />With the help of a lot of discarded army prototype's that the company gave up on, light weight, bullet-proof armor becomes the batsuit, while memory fabric becomes the basis for the batcape, & a vehicle called the tumbler, that makes the new model Humvee look like a Yugo, becomes the hell-raising Batmobile.<br /><br />Justice has a new face & for the filth & scum of Gotham City, fear has a new name in the form of..., Batman.<br /><br />\\"Why bats sir?\\"<br />\\"Becuase I fear them. It's time my enemies share my dread.\\"<br /><br />With the help of former girlfriend turned city attorney, Rachel Dawes & an alliance, partnership with, a future police commisioner, Jim Gordon, the first order of Batman's business is to destroy Falcone and his mob. But, Falcone isn't the only trash that Batman has to take to out. A mad psychiatrist who goes by the name of Scarecrow, who uses a toxin that hallucinates the victim's worst fears, is secretly in league with darker forces. Forces that have a link to Batman & Bruce Wayne's past.<br /><br />\\"I can't kill you. But, I'm not going to save you.\\"<br /><br />After the horrendous \\"Batman & Robin\\", I thought this was the end for the \\"Batman\\" films. There were some rumblings about trying to do something with \\"Batman\\" in the late 90's, but, nothing concrete to go on. With the success of \\"Spider-Man\\" & the \\"X Men\\" films, & not wanting to let the latest comic book to movie fad pass them by, Warner Bros. gave the greenlight for a new \\"Batman\\" film.<br /><br />\\"Why do we fall?\\"<br />\\"So that we learn to pick ourselves up.\\"<br />\\"I thought you'd given up on me.\\"<br />\\"Never.\\"<br /><br />Christopher Nolan agreed to direct the film, after being influenced by the \\"Batman\\" comic serial \\"The Long Halloween\\" (starting in 2000 \\"The Long Halloween\\" spanned over a year & is considered to be one of the best \\"Batman\\" stories of the new millenium). With great respect towards the DC comic & it's long running legacy, Nolan began searching for the new Batman.<br /><br />He found Batman in the form of Christian Bale. Bale's resume includes the cult film \\"American Psycho\\", as well as \\"Reign of Fire\\" & \\"The Machinist\\". Out of the four actor's who have portrayed the character, for me, Bale is the best Batman (Keaton comes in second, Kilmer third, & Clooney gets the consolation gift). He brings a certain physicality to the role that was somehow missing in the past. Bale, also, seemed to slip into the role easily, since he played this sort of character in the past. A dark revelation that's a bit uncomfortable, is that Patrick Bateman is no Batman but, both Bateman & Bruce Wayne have dual personalities.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is terrific. Michael Caine gracefully takes over for the great Michael Gough as  the butler, Alfred, bringing warmth & charm to the fatherly figure that Bruce needs.<br />Katie Holmes is perfect as Rachel Dawes, instead of being the usual Bat-dame, she gives the role smarts.<br />Rounding out the cast is Morgan Freeman as Lucious Fox, Cillian Murphy, Rutger Hauer, & in an awesome role that I hope he reprises in the sequel (like there isn't gonna be one?!), Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Jim Gordan. Oldman nailed the part of Gordan so well it gave me the creeps. From the feathered back graying hair, the bushy moustache, & the classic glasses & weather beaten trenchcoat Gordan jumped out of the comic book & right onto the screen. Oldman's performance is that good.<br /><br />I really didn't have any problems with \\"Batman Begins\\", like I did with the other \\"Batman\\" films. With Tim Burton's two \\"Bat\\" films the problem, for me, was that even though the films were dark & gothic (that's not the problem) it was that the films seem to take place in a different part of history, in a different place, just off kilter.

B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend really hit a homerun with his first album/project along with help from good ol' Kanye West!  Get Lifted has to be one of the standout albums of the year, not just for male R&B but albums period.  If this does not pick up a Grammy this coming February, it is highway robbery.  Chicago is known for it's soul and making you feel good on the inside as well as connecting from the heart on heartbreaking and down times.  This album does that very well.  The balance of going from up-tempo type of beats to slow melodic harmonies is shown well on here.  He has a great voice and combine that with his great ability to play the piano shows him as a great, outstanding artist.  The album starts off with Let's Get Lifted, very good start.  Then comes the album's first single, When I Used To Love U.  I was so feeling this when it first came out late last year.  This track rings so true cause there are people (both men and women) who don't appreciate things you do for them or cut you down for things you can't do for them so you have to let it go.   Tracks 4-7 is telling a story kind of how he's approached a lady he's seen and makes her his girl on the side type of situation cheating on his main girl but comes to realize he doesn't want to lose her and decides to change his ways (Alright, She Don't Have To Know, Number One, and I Can Change), all great tracks.  But the album really shines to me from Track 8, Ordinary People, on through the rest of the album.  Ordinary People of course was the second single and as it should have been was a big hit, although they started to play it too much.  Stay With You is a very uplifting, while slow, melodic  type of song.  This track is outstanding to me basically talking about how he will never leave now staying through good times as well as the bad.  Let's Get Lifted Again, So High (current single), and Refuge shine as well.  But my favorites are the last two tracks: It Don't Have to Change and Live It Up.  It Don't Have To Change isa track dedicated to how his family used to be and have kind of gone their separate ways, kind of how my family is now which is why i love this track so much.  But he said it doesn't have to change their love.  Then comes Live It Up when he finally makes it big and he can share it with the one he loves, something I hope to be able to do and sing to a lady down the road.  This album is vintage old school.  If you love classic R&B, you will love this.  Way to go, John Legend!

Coupled with an equally fetching soundtrack (worth buying in itself!) I had a really hard time looking away from the screen...thank God for the pause button!<br /><br />The theme of forbidden passion in a rigid moralistic society is fairly common in Chinese films, here the visual and aural beauty gives it a massive kick in the @ss.  This is a film worth watching many times, it has many layers and its characters are complex as is the actual plot.  Plot, schplott, who cares when a film is this beautiful to look at and listen to?

B00080ZG60|5.0|This is a sensational, sci-fi, alien invasion, action film with a terrific cast and superlative special effects. Alien invaders suddenly darken the skyline across the world, as city sized flying saucers hover ominously over major cities world wide. A computer geek, David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), figures out how the alien ships are communicating with each other and realizes the import of what he has discovered. He manages to have an audience with President Whitmore (Bill Pullam), as his ex-wife is one of the president's top aides, and tells the president of his findings. Wonder at the alien saucer spectacle turns to terror, as the meaning of the ships in the sky becomes clear.<br /><br />The White House evacuates just in time, as the aliens launch a world wide attack in complete synchronization, an awesome spectacle that enthralls the viewer. A counter attack is launched, led by fighter pilot Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith), which ends in disaster for the fighter pilots, as only Hiller survives to fight another day. He manages, however, to bring in a captive. Notwithstanding the gravity of the premise of the film, there are moments of comic relief interspersed throughout.<br /><br />Meanwhile, our computer geek, realizing why the counter attack failed, comes up with a solution, one that requires nerves of steel and a desire to walk on the wild side. A second counter attack is launched world wide, which leads to some terrific action scenes and heroics by a most unlikely candidate. Naturally, mankind is victorious. It is not the victory itself, however, but what leads up to the victory that makes the film so entertaining.<br /><br />This is a fast paced film with a myriad of subplots and coincidental pairings that may stretch the viewer's credence but do not take away from the enjoyment of the film. The special effects are dazzling. The cast is excellent. Will Smith is charming and funny throughout. Bill Pullam is appropriately presidential, and Jeff Goldblum is a most convincing computer geek. Look for fine performances from the stellar supporting cast: Mary McConnell, Robert Loggia, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Judd Hirsch, James Rebhorn, Harry Connick, Jr., and Harvey Fierstein. All in all, this is a marvelous film.<br /><br />Be prepared for an unintended poignant moment in the film, when the camera pans to the New York skyline and the viewer sees the World Trade Center twin towers standing proud and tall on the horizon. It is a moment that gives the viewer pause in remembrance of what was. It is, indeed, a moment to remember.ost convincing computer geek.

B00062J00S|5.0|Since I saw this movie several times before, when I decided to see it again I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did.  One sign of a truly great movie is that you can watch it more than once and enjoy it.  This is a great movie.<br /><br />It cuts to the heart of the question of what makes life worthwhile.  The answer that it gives is that the kind acts that we do, the love we show, are what makes life worth living.<br /><br />I like the way it portrays America as being run by greedy and power hungry men.  The whole world is run by them.  But they don't run everything.  And I believe that the underlying premise of this movie, that there is a Heaven, that there is a God, even that there are angels, is very likely true, and that the purpose of living our lives here is not to amass the greatest fortune before we die.  It's to build bonds of loyalty and love to take home to Heaven with us when we graduate from this school of hard knocks.<br /><br />I don't want to claim that this movie is perfect.  It never pays to do that.  A good review, even if it's a rave, should have some constructive criticism in it.  I haven't seen a perfect movie yet.<br /><br />In that spirit I would say that even though Donna Reed's acting is good as George Bailey's wife, the script writer used her as a cardboard character who never falls off her pedestal.  It was a badly written character, a non-person, just too perfect.  I see no reason for that, considering that the writer showed us George Bailey at his worst, badgering a teacher on the phone, badgering his kids, occasionally being a dope.  The writer should have breathed at least a little life and imperfection into Mrs Bailey too.  She should not have been written as a robot.  She could also have been given a sense of humor.<br /><br />I got a kick out of the cabbie and the cop being named Ernie and Bert.  I understand that the Sesame Street characters were named after them.<br /><br />In today's world, where we only believe what we can see with our own eyes, I think we've lost some truths that are contained in this movie.  I'm not kidding.  I think there are angels, and I think there is a Heaven, and I think that those things are more real than the chair you're sitting on.  We teach our kids to believe in Santa Claus, and then we pull the rug out from under them and let them know Santa isn't real, but I think you will be surprised to find out that Heaven is real, angels are real, and God is real.  I don't think those are just children's stories.<br /><br />I would also disagree with the director's decision to show Jimmy Stewart at his worst.  In a few scenes he is really, and there is no other way of putting it, an obnoxious jerk.  As soon as life deals him some legal trouble, he gets really bad.  I'd prefer my heroes to show a little more poise under pressure, and George Bailey fails miserably in that department.  While Donna Reed is far too goody-goody, with no blood running through her veins, Jimmy Stewart is at times a most unlikeable hero.  We have to remind ourselves that he did save a life or two and make a few sacrifices earlier in life.<br /><br />Another problem I have with this film is that I don't understand how a bank president (isn't that what he is?) and a real estate developer (isn't he that too?) is doing so poorly financially, and why the loss of $6,000 would be so devastating to his savings and loan.  That's a bit much to swallow.  When Uncle Stupid lost the money, I really don't think the roof caves in on a savings and loan.<br /><br />In other words, we are being fed a sob story that can't be real.<br /><br />Lionel Barrymore makes a wonderful villain.  Actually he reminds me of Jim Backus as Mister Magoo, minus the myopia.  He represents the Evil Capitalist, the greedy miser who owns everything.  Did you notice that when George Bailey is removed from the picture, it turns out that Mister Magoo turned his town into a place full of girly shows?  That is so funny.  In those innocent post-war days, the way they painted a bad town was by putting girly shows in it.  Drugs?  Crime?  Of course not.  Those were innocent days.<br /><br />There are times in all our lives that we want to escape our reality, we want to die, we wish we were never born, and so on.  I feel that way a few times a day, actually.  It is comforting to think that it really is important that we lived, that we really did have a good impact on someone.  Did I?  I don't know.  I'm glad for George Bailey's sake that he did.  Now if only he could learn to curb that obnoxious and self centered behavior of his, and be more sensitive to other people's feelings.  Sometimes he's like a child, just popping out with the stupidest and most cutting things.  Good thing he gave us reasons to like him, because it isn't always easy.in it.  Drugs?   Crime?

B000002JPA|5.0|This is Dream Theaters 2nd cd and is their 2nd best. If it wasnt for Scenes from a memory then this would be the best.
0812932293|4.0|Branson's book is very interesting and inspiring.  He does a good job of describing how he makes his decisions and what he thinks is important.
B00006G8G1|3.0|First, the music on this DVD is spectacular! I recommend any IM fan to pick up the CD version of this concert which, as far as I could tell, is the same music as the DVD. See my review of the CD for more. <br /> <br />On the plus side -- it's good to see Bruce and Adrian back with the boys. Although in their mid to late 50s, they still put on a heck of a show. <br /> <br />Some gripes -- if you do not have Dolby 5.1 or DTS, you'll be disappointed. I watched the video on my laptop through stereo headphones (the DVD audio menu doesn't have a stereo option), and all of the rear channels were completely wiped out, which means most of the crowd noise was gone (which is a bummer on songs like \\"The Clansman\\" and \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\" but a plus on songs like \\"The Evil that Men Do\\"). It's also hard to tell which guitarist is in which channel some of the time (how do you port 3 guitarists through 2 channels?!). On Live After Death, Dave Murray took the left channel exclusively and Adrian Smith the right channel exclusively. I imagined that the production designers would funnel Murray into the left channel, Smith into the center channel (or rather, \\"both\\" R+L channels), and Gers into the right channel, but that's not always the case. Smith's signal roams a bit depending on what he's doing (and he totally leaves the stage during the intro to \\"Fear of the Dark,\\" which he states on the Iron Maiden official website is his favorite to play from the years he was outside the band!). I'm also a bit disappointed with the song list. With Adrian back, it would be nice to hear some of his stuff like \\"Wasted Years,\\" \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" (which the band attempted to keep playing after Smith left and failed miserably each time I heard them play it), anything off of \\"Powerslave\\" (besides \\"2 Minutes to Midnight\\"), \\"Still Life,\\" \\"The Prisoner,\\" etc. <br /> <br />The main gripe that I have is very, very serious. I adore Steve Harris immensely. I think he is the best bassist of his music genre, hands down. However, I don't think he's a very good production supervisor/editor of movies (I believe he edited this DVD). Here's why: during the DVD, you probably view each shot for about 3 seconds (maximum!) before switching to another band member or angle. Honestly, I felt like I was in some kind of blasted haunted house with a strobe light the whole time. I actually felt dizzy after a few songs. The constant switching of cameras and angles is terrible. I remember watching Live After Death on video tape years ago and that was a great production; lots of wide angle shots, and none of this hyper-camera switching going on. It's not the production quality of the film that's poor, it's the editing that needed help. <br /> <br />One last thing -- Guys, lose the spandex. The 80s are over. And Murray, stop wearing Iron Maiden t-shirts. It's corny to wear your own band's shirt. <br /> <br />If you're a completist, you'll want it. If not, I suggest just renting the DVD from an online video rental company, watching it, enjoying it, and then returning it.
6305657947|5.0|For a movie just to remove the ordinary from your day and bring a touch of lightheartedness to your world, this is a great pick! There are twists that are understood and some sleight of hand not to be understood but just enjoyed.  After you watch this movie, just getting a glimpse of a derby hat in the distance will create a whole new enjoyment. While others have indicated there is not enough sophistication in this movie, the cast brings it just the right touch of class. Not a movie to be forgotten. Watching it just once, it will be remembered. But for the full enjoyment, you'll want to watch it again.
B0007CNXUK|3.0|First, when I say \\"not a kid's movie\\" I do not mean that it contains anything inappropriate for children, but simply that most kids will be disappointed if they watch it based on the ads they saw for it on TV.  Despite me stating that the plot of Neverland is \\"predictable\\", I found that the way it was marketed left me completely surprised when I purchased the DVD.  I was left expecting a show that was fantastical and sort of a \\"real life Peter Pan story.\\"  This movie is instead a poignant story of a young boy dealing with the death of his Father, illness in his Mother, while developing a mature and unique relationship with the man who would write the play that became \\"Peter Pan\\".  Depp's character borrows from the imagination of this pained youth to develop Peter Pan while attempting to provide the boy with a safe harbor in which to express and deal with the obvious pain he feels. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a sophisticated quasi love story with a back drop of the real and imagined creation of Peter Pan, you'll probably enjoy this movie.  I prefer movies with happy endings, and this one doesn't fit that bill (at least for me).  The peformances of Depp and Winslet are everything you'd expect.  The performance of Freddie Highmore, who plays the key young man (Peter, of course), is almost itself enough to make this movie worth watching.
B000006P8I|5.0|If you are a fan of either David Bowie or Marc Bolan, you will probably know that both were friends and rivals, and both were Glam stars, Bowie solo and Bolan with T.Rex. What you may not have known is that both had a completely different sound than their future efforts, but a very similar sound to each other.  <br /> <br />This album is more of a folk-pop-rock album than anything Glam, and it is all the more charming for that. It is similar to the early Tyranosaurus Rex albums, so if you are a fan of them, pick this up. If you would like to hear a different side of Bowie, buy this. Each song [with the exception of Please Mister Gravedigger] is excellent.  <br /> <br />I would highly recommend picking up this album, it is well worth the minimal cost, and it is very interesting to hear such a different sound from such a household name.

0895260131|5.0|This book is an excellent, if unbalanced, view of Islam. That said, I don't think anyone would expect it to be balanced, and in fact I do not think it is the author's intent to be balanced. Spencer, I think, is trying to even the scales with those apologists who claim Islam is harmless and presents no inherent danger to the West and those in the mainstream media, the left, and the academic world who simply ignore facts that might bring their worldview crumbling down. It's more an expose of the ugly underside of the subject, one that rarely sees the light of day because of our biased media and insufferably PC academics, than it is a full review of Islamic history and thought. <br /> <br />In that sense this is an important book to read for those interested in the middle east, terrorism, history and islam. It may be a sad truth that academics and mainstream media won't say a truth merely because they think it will make someone angry or because it is a truth that makes a group that is protected by the PC dogma look bad, but it is a truth just the same. Americans have been poorly serbed by our \\"experts\\" and this book offers an antidote to the cowardly and often disengenuous approach too many take to the subject. Spencer is to be admired for his attempt to point out some ugly issues that rarely, if ever, see the light of day and to offer facts that we would not, unfortunately come across otherwise.

B00005JNTX|5.0|There are, as of this writing, 363 reviews of Sin City at Amazon.com. Frankly, I find it difficult to say anything that hasn't already been said. I have long been a fan of the Sin City comics and so I'm delighted with the movie. No other film based on ANY comic has so accurately been brought to life. I was entranced. Yes, it's violent. And dark. And graphic. Well, duh. It's called \\"SIN CITY\\" for a reason. If you're a fan of the comics, you will love this movie. If not, you probably won't. It really is that simple. My only complaint about this film is shallow. Really shallow. Be warned. <br />Jessica Alba plays a stripper in danger who is repeatedly saved by a cop named Hartigan (Bruce Willis). This is my complaint: strippers take off their clothes. She doesn't. Told you I'm shallow. But, still. Given the incredibly faithful adaption of the rest of the comic to film, this one ommission was glaring. Actors and Actresses take note: if you have a \\"no-nudity\\" clause in your contract, you are probably not the correct person to portray a stripper.   <br />That aside, this was an extrordinary film and I'll definately watch it again.
B00025ETIW|5.0|Usually when i buy a cd, there are always a few tracks i dont like, but not with this cd, every song is worth listening to! if ur a fan of pop music like usher and black eyed peas you probably won't like this, but to anyone who is a fan of punk, rock or emo this is a must buy! Gerard, Mikey, Frank, Matt and Ray are an awesome band, their first cd was pretty good and this is definatly a step up.  Three cheers for sweet revenge has a good mix of songs with great lyrics.  Some of my favorite songs are Helena, Im not Okay, Ghost of you, I never told you what i do for a living, and all the other songs on the cd!

B000001DTM|5.0|Should be required listening for anyone trying to deepen his or her enjoyment of music.  Seriously, it is that good.  This album does not play like it is over 10 years old; in fact, it embarrasses most of the bands out there today, indicting them with compelling lyrics and heart-piercing instrumentation.  Time to grow up and add this to your collection.

The bonus live performances: 'Why Does It Hurt So Bad' and 'Lover For Life' are fantastic!!

B0007GAERG|5.0|ALthough I am a crazy Mariah Carey fan and love The Emancipation of Mimi to death, I have to also promote a good friend of Mariah. Toni Braxton, another favorite of mine, is bringing the heat on the 27th. You'll need to cop that album, LIBRA, beacause the songs are great and her voice is beautiful. For even more information go to her website [...] Just like Mariah's return to form and diva status, Toni Braxton is right behind her. May this wonderful Diva continue to grace us with her presence, just as Mariah. So please, BUY LIBRA the 27th.

0380789035|4.0|Neil Gaiman is simply a fantastic (in both senses of the word) writer and a deft hand at generating a palpable world filled with the most bizarre yet believable characters and circumstances.<br /><br />I wasn't certain what I would find in this book and as a Heathen dedicated to Odin was prepared to be generally annoyed and disappointed and Mr. Gaiman's handling of the Gods I walk with.  I have never had my expectations more happily obliterated.  Mr. Wednesday strikes very true to the old One Eye I know in so many ways and the tale that plays out entangling Wednesday, Shadow and Low Key is worthy of the Gods involved.<br /><br />I also thoroughly appreciated the author's less than subtle dig at the neo-pagan community.<br /><br />If this book were from any other author, it would have garnered five stars from me.  However, as a follow up effort to Gaiman's previous novel \\"Neverwhere\\" this book is actually a little disappointing as it simply falls short of his previous masterpiece.
B000001FS3|5.0|Here is a beautiful object lesson for today's \\"angry youth\\":  you don't have to girate to a repetitive, mindless beat while shouting pointless, profanity-laden tirades to express yourself.  Marvel at how these guys do it.  Subtle, eerie, thoughtful, powerful.  You feel that these guys are searchers, not always happy with the state of things, but not resorting to jeuvenile antics to express themselves.  They're political without naming names.  Great stuff that needs to be in your collection.

B000002MFN|5.0|To me this is Madonna's best album besides \\"Like a Prayer.\\"  If it had not been released alongside that crazy book, it may have gotten more of the respect it deserved.  Lyrically she is at her best on this album.  There's hardly any s-e-x stuff on it, contrary to what people believe.  I'd say though it is her least accessible album.  But highly original for its time!

B00005JM02|5.0|My 8-year old grandson and I watched this one evening, and I was more than pleasantly surprised by the fun I had.  The characters and voices are so lively, and it's a wonderful message for people of all ages.  I haven't watched a cartooon in years, and found the humor geared to adults and children equally.  (It really is amazing what they can do with the computer cartoon drawing nowadays --  it was like watching real people!)  If you want to spend quality time with youngsters, while being entertained, then this is the perfect film.  If you are a romantic, like me, you might even find need of a tissue later in the film.  Both the humor and poignancy will wet your eyes.  Enjoy!

B0000CDL93|5.0|Oliver Stone has not been precisely my favorite director, but it goes far beyond any other reason not to acknowledge the undeniable virtues of this superb movie. A treasured picture that will be increasing gradually through years, once the actual generations or the previous who lived and witnessed the sordid JFK `s assassination and all the set of dark events hidden backstage.<br /><br />Stone recreates through a superb edition work a true sinister puzzle of unknown mechanism, disproving the pretended and infantile argument that argues Lee Harvey Oswald was the only brain master and executor of  this horrid fact. Kevin Costner starring Jim Garrison will be the assigned spokesman to reveal step by step, the immense tangle and multiple circuital web of facts and characters evolved. The thesis of the self will bullet that described a curious path is a trick that hardly could be managed by the same Dave Copperfield.<br /><br />Intriguing, sensationalist if you want but extremely passionate, systematic and exhausting rebuilding of the events that make you reconsider -with Executive Action, a previous film of 1973 sincerely recommended- that not all what it glitters is gold.<br /><br />Towering performances by Pesci, Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones and the brief cameo by Sutherland.<br /><br />\\"Commit a crime; and the world is made of glass.\\" Ralph Waldo Emerson.

B000005RFQ|5.0|I know that many black sabbath fans are purists and they don't accept other singer as Ozzy. But let me share my thoughs about the band and this album in particular. <br />The band has shown during all its life to adapt itselt to the environment. We all know that many singers drummers, bass players have jammed with Mr. Iommi.  <br />Ozzy carved his trade mark with a raw style, delightful and soulful by the way, but also Dio did three great albums and Tony Martin did great albums as well, listen the ethernal idol, and so on. <br />Born Again it is an album that will produce awe at first feel and the more you play it you will sign your own covenant with this album. Gillan is a master! <br />The band starts with thrashed, when you listen this song you will fell like you were drinking beers very fast in a rollercoaster in motion. The albums also have a cople of instrumental songs, stonehenge and the dark, they are the intros for Disturbing the Priest and Zero the Hero (just incredible!) <br />One of the best parts in the album is born again, melancolic and sTrong! and the album has a great finale with \\"keep it warm\\" <br />This album is a good one

B00081U7HC|4.0|The first thing that strikes the audience after have viewed Pretty Woman is the contrasting similarities between the two leads.  One an aristocrat the other belongs to the lower class.  They share occupational immorality in their quest for money.  Neither fit into the other's environment, as each social setting requires a certain street smarts, or social etiquette, yet they manage with the help of the power of economic status.  Despite their financial differences they both share a mutual vision of integrity and righteousness.  Pretty Woman delivers a Cinderella story in the modern light where socioeconomic values are tested.<br /><br />Turning tricks is what the high school dropout Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts) has to do when money is short and rent is due.  It is not something she strives to do for a professional career, but her situation leaves her no other options than to seek monetary refuge in the oldest of professions.  Carefully Vivian approaches her job with protection of latex and cleanliness, as dangers lure around every corner.  In addition, Vivian must take care of her roommate Kit De Luca (Laura San Giacomo) who easily falls in the hands of the wrong company and drugs.<br /><br />On occasion dreams come true, but there are no more knights in shining armor that come and save the day.  Instead the sharp businessman and billionaire Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) approaches Vivian's street in a Lotus Esprit that he handles feebly.  Lost and disoriented Edward requests Vivian's help, but she does not help him for free.  The situation leads Edward to hire her as a guide back to Beverly Hills where he is staying in a luxurious hotel's penthouse.  In turn it leads to a night and then a week that Edward hires Vivian's company, as he also has just broken up with his girlfriend hours before he met Vivian.<br /><br />The time that Edward and Vivian spend together displays the differences between the two through awkward, yet amusing moments.  There are also moments where the social differences are accentuated through offensive behaviors towards Vivian and her presence while shopping in expensive stores.  However, Edward's presence, or known existence seem to be all Vivian needs in order to get out of trouble.  This strongly suggests that money rules, and a scene when Edward takes Vivian out shopping displays the ultimate truth of human greed.<br /><br />The director Garry Marshall creates a fairy tale where impossible happens, a rich businessman falls in love with a cheap hooker.  For many it might be a dream, a dream worth dreaming, but it is also important to understand that dreams only come true through hard work.  This hard work is present in the film through Edwards' relentless efforts to continue to build his empire, which has helped him build fortune.  Another notion that emerges during the viewing is they both help one another to find a happier existence, which suggests that wealth is not everything in life.  All of these moral messages are brought out amidst the contrasting similarities in Pretty Woman, which delivers an adult and lightly amusing contemporary fairy tale.<br /><br />One thing that hurts the film is its R rating, as the film presents adult material with a PG approach.  The notion of an adult themed fairy tale should be pondered in the light of the Brother's Grimm stories, which were disturbingly bloody and intended for children.  Nonetheless, Pretty Woman also offers the idea that violence and horror is not necessary to present at message.  However, the gentle method of telling the story of Vivian makes it a little too one-dimensional for an adult, and more intended for a teen audience.where the social differences are accentuated through offensive behaviors towards Vivian and her presence while shopping in expensive stores.

B0009QTS1M|5.0|it's about time the greatest movie ever made gets an extended edition dvd released.  if you've seen this movie already you don't want to miss out on a chance to own the theatrical and extended version. <br />the 2nd disc is jam packed full of extras that go in depth on the era the film takes place in, production, wardrobe, weapons, etc.. <br />i highly recommend this dvd.
1573223026|1.0|This book is horrible.     Let me sum it up for you so you don't waste your time reading it.    Four suicidal people happen upon each other on top of a building on New Year's Eve. They all intend to jump off, but don't. You are then taken through 300 pages of painful stream-of-conscious dialogue from 4 very uninteresting characters that become friends and do absolutely nothing that resembles a story or is even remotely interesting.
B000092ZYX|5.0|About 2 years ago, i was stuck in a rut musically. All music sounded exactly the same to me. It seemed everyone was doing the whole emo/hardcore thing. One day i decided to be completely random, and by a radiohead CD. This cd was hail to the thief. <br /> <br />THIS ALBUM IS INCREDIBLE! <br /> <br />2+2=5 starts the CD off with an eerie sort of dark song that slowly picks up in to a really interesting almost heavy song. Then all of the other songs flow so beautifully. It truely is amazing. The things they can do amaze me every single time i listen. Since i bought this CD, i bought Okay Computer, Pablo Honey, Amnesiac, but this one is my favorite because of its unique sound, and their ability to combine so many different sounds to create one enormous musical beast.
B0000CAXID|4.0|There are a lot of reviews that analyze the songs, and go &quot;This one is about Nirvana, this one is about corruption, this one is about the industry...&quot; Blah blah blah...It's not true! Dave says the songs are about nothing. NOTHING! He says he just put nonsense that rhymed or fit the melody, and though people try to analyze it, it doesn't mean anything. Don't let someone tell you what the songs are about, and don't try to analyze them yourself. To each his own, if it speaks to you...it is what it is. They're cool, I mean, they're good songs, but they mean NOTHING to the person who wrote them. Remember this.
B00005JN5X|1.0|Okay, will someone please tell Terry Gilliam that even in today's world well-written characters, good acting, and crisp plotting are still essential elements of a good movie? <br /> <br />Now the ideas in The Brothers Grimm are outstanding.  Jake and Will Grimm are a cross between 18th century ghostbusters and storytellers.  It was indeed intriguing to see Gilliam's vision of twisted origins of our favorite fairy tales.  Fascinating it was to see how daily events -- some dramatic, some mundane - led to elements of Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Rapunzel.  Not to mention Cinderella, in the only truly amusing scene where Damon and Ledger scrub a hut in frocks and bonnets.  And whenever Gilliam avoided CGI, the cinematography was (excuse the pun, but it's truly the correct word) \\"enchanting.\\" <br /> <br />So now you're wondering -- why the 1 rating? <br /> <br />Simply put, I've just revealed all that is good about this movie.  How should we begin to describe its flaws? <br /> <br />Let's start with the needless gore.  This movie didn't need to show a torso missing its bottom half.  (It's not Scream, for God's sake!)  But even worse, there was absolutely NO point to include a scene where the heroine trapper skins a rabbit for about 2 minutes.  And this next one should convince you to leave the kiddies at home...how do you like a cat falling into a spinning rotary torture device, getting splayed, being spattered across the room, having bloody parts land on people, and having one of them cheekily pluck it into his mouth.  Ahh, what a delightful hor'dourve cat innards must make. <br /> <br />Pointless, expendable, completely unnecessary.  Now as a fan of zombie flicks and horror films, I am not a sensitive soul who cannot appreciate a bit of the visceral.  But not in the movie.  It only serves to bring you out of the story. <br /> <br />Let's talk CGI, shall we?  Awful.  Completely takes over the movie.  Sometimes it is OK.  Sometimes it is so fake that you wonder if you're watching the Incredible Hulk again.  The werewolf (yes, I said werewolf) in particular can't even compete with the 1980's computer wizardry in such movies as the Howling.  Also the use of swarms of CGI bugs was ok once....but repetitive after the third time. <br /> <br />The acting was abysmal.  If you have any respect for the actors Matt Damon and Heath Ledger (as I do), you'll be amazed at how flat they are.  Ledger practically disappears into the exquisite scenery, while Damon tries in vain to project the wise-ass comraderie that served him well in Dogma.  Try to imagine the worst high school play actor you've ever seen and the worst French accent you've ever heard.  Put them together and you pretty much have the prototype for all of the French characters in this film. <br /> <br />Finally, Gilliam adopts a page out of Michael Bay's book. \\"If you don't like this exciting scene; don't worry, another will be coming right at you.\\"  Gilliam throws everything but the kitchen sink into this story which taxes the viewer to endure event after event.   <br /> <br />The Brothers Grimm should be studied in film school as an example of how to completely ruin a good concept.

0375703861|5.0|To be honest, in the aftermath of the July 7 bombings in London, my mind flew back to this novel, the brilliant literary debut from then 23 year old Zadie Smith. Why? Some common elements between the two.<br /><br />It's a witty, funny, and touching look at the lives of some immigrant families in the UK. In particular, the intertwining of the families of white Archie Jones (a `loser' married to a black West Indian woman Clara) and his friend Samad Iqbal, a muslim originally from Bangladesh (who tries to bring up his twin sons (Millat and Magid) to be good muslims, and at the same time decent British citizens).<br /><br />Archie has a beautiful but confused daughter Irie, and her relationship with her parents, as well as with her maternal grandmother is a mix of comical and sad.<br /><br />Samad, on the other hand, is worried that his sons are derailing from the religious path he has tried so hard to steer them along and in despair sends one (Magid) off to Bangladesh to acquire traditional and religious rooting. However, Magid comes back drastically changed, and there lies the parallel with July 7. No, he does not become a suicide bomber but you do get some insight into the thinking of these people.<br /><br />The characters in this book are not super heroes, or anything that glamorous; just simple, warm, funny, confused individuals, something like you and me? A very vivid look at the multi ethnic hot pot of London.<br /><br />Very well written and captivating, it was made into a TV series in the UK in 2001. A brilliant debut!

0060005696|5.0|You don't have to do anything but die and pay taxes. Really, you don't even have to pay taxes; you choose to because not paying them would lead to problems.<br /><br />Barry Schwartz, in this little gem of a book, reminds us that life can be defined as a series of choices. You choose to get up in the morning. You choose to shower, get dressed and go to work. You choose where (or whether) to go to college, what car to buy, what job offer to accept, what flavor of ice cream to eat.<br /><br />Twenty-first-century Americans have a wider array of choices to make than any other society in history. More schools, more cars, more occupations, more styles of blue jeans. That should be a good thing, right? Well, yes... and no. Schwartz shows us how an overabundance of choices can lead to us to squander our time and our emotional energy, endlessly agonizing over every single choice, breathlessly analyzing every possible option, angle and outcome. As if that weren't enough, Schwartz explains, the more options there are, the more likely we are to regret the one we chose, no matter how well it might suit our needs.<br /><br />The \\"simple life\\" of our ancestors was one of limited choices. People tended to spend their lives in the city where they grew up, stay married to one person, and keep the same job until they retired. As limiting as that sounds, research shows that people were happier 40 years ago than we are now.<br /><br />So will it take a return to the 1960s to make us all happy? Certainly not. Abundant options are a good thing, as long as we approach them rationally. For every decision we face, there's another decision we have to make first: whether to maximize or satisfice. To maximize is to meticulously analyze and compare every possible option. To satisfice is to limit the number of options considered and to accept the first one that will satisfy us. Whereas you should be a maximizer in choosing a mate, you can probably afford to be a satisficer when you pick which car to buy. Even if you find later on that the car you bought is inferior to one of the others you considered, you must weigh that disappointment against the emotional cost of agonizing over a decision whose implications are relatively temporary.<br /><br />The Paradox of Choice is the best kind of self-help book. It's unemotional and never preachy. It makes its case  with hard scientific data, never talking down to the reader. And, in the last quarter of the book, it suggests practical solutions for simplifying life.which car to buy.

In fact, I never pay for these sets, even though I love the show, I always ask for them as gifts because I weon't spend the money on a collection with no commentary.

0062511408|1.0|Un libro que se traduzca a por lo menos cincuentisis idiomas y que supere las veintisiete millones de copias vendidas tiene que ser fabuloso, verdad? Un libro que siga por aos en las listas de popularidad y que catapulte a su autor al estrellato tiene que ser excelente, cierto? Un libro cuya edicin ms reciente traiga una introduccin, un prefacio y un prlogo --es decir, tres prembulos-- tiene que decir algo importante, no es as? <br /> <br />Las respuestas son no, no y no. <br /> <br />Me refiero a El Alquimista, el bestseller de Paulo Coelho.  <br /> <br />Es uno de los peores libros que he leido. No lo digo por exagerar. <br /> <br />Lo s. Habr quienes dirn que esta crtica es el sentimiento amargo de un don nadie que envidia el xito del autor. Estn en lo cierto en cuanto a que soy un don nadie. Aclaro tambin que s, que me placera si estuviera mi libro entre los ms vendidos, pero no critico esta obra por su xito sino a pesar de su xito. <br /> <br />Tambin s que llego tarde con mis pobres abucheos. Se public hace ms de diez aos. Pero ahora fue que lo le. No lo le antes porque ola el muerto. Sospechaba que el libro era un producto empacado, como las tocinetas que ponen en plsticos de mallitas pero no dejan de ser tocinetas. Un amigo me advirti que las analogas de Coelho eran tan burdas como un hipoptamo en bikinis. <br /> <br />Lo le por recomendacin, aunque la persona que lo recomend era una desconocida, y mejor que lo sea. Supongo que la recomendacin era una de las benditas seales de las que tanto habla el autor en su fbula para seguir sueos. Porque una novela no es. Tampoco es un cuento. Y como muchos sueos es incoherente. <br /> <br />Me burlo de las introducciones, todas escritas por el mismo autor --imagnense esto: un artista que sale a la escena y se presenta a s mismo tres veces --, pero dir que estos prembulos son lo ms digno que tiene el libro. Es donde Coelho revela el secreto de la vida: caerse siete vecesy levantarse ocho. <br /> <br />Yo me ca como siete veces al leer el libro, pero fue de la risa. <br /> <br />Es una especie de catecismo; mal escrito, por cierto. Esta es la trama: un pastor que se llama Santiago tiene un sueo recurrente. El sueo le muestra las pirmides de Egipto. Una gitana, interpretadora de sueos, le dice que all hay un tesoro. El pastor (o \\"el muchacho\\", como el narrador prefiere llamarle en tono paternalista) vende sus ovejas, abandona su mundo y arriesga todo en busca de su tesoro. Encuentra dificultades, pero persiste en busca de su supuesta historia personal. Adems se le aparecen sabios, que lo animan a seguir. Y termina encontrando lo que buscaba, con la ayuda de un tal alquimista que solamente aparece en la ltima parte del libro, y enamorndose de una mujer, pues necesitaba su Dulcinea para que trajera el paquete completo. <br /> <br />Esa es solamente la trama. La gracia de la historia no est tanto en lo que sucede, sino en lo que \\"el muchacho\\" aprende en busca de su tesoro. Y all es donde se encuentran joyas de sabidura como estas, que transcribo a la exactitud: <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Cuando no se puede volver, slo debemos estar preocupados por el mejor modo de seguir adelante\\". <br /> <br /> <br />Increble. Qu iluminador. Entonces, cuando no se puede volver hacia atrs hay que seguir adelante. Nunca se me hubiera ocurrido. Gracias a El Alquimista ahora lo s. Pero como el mismo \\"alquimista\\" (del que nunca sabemos ni el nombre) nos dice: \\"estas cosas son tan sencillas que pueden escribirse en una esmeralda\\". <br /> <br />Y ya no sigo, porque ni siquiera hablar de las oraciones vacuas, del antiintelectualismo simplista, de la repeticin de frases de la Nueva Era y del Dios-Al-Creador, ni del amor instantneo que \\"el muchacho\\" profesa por una mujer que no conoce. Los personajes son de cartn; la trama es risible; las lecciones, desquiciadoras. <br /> <br />Queda la pregunta de por qu un libro que sea tan malo (porque no soy el nico crtico) se haya ganado los corazones de tantos lectores. Yo me atrevo a decir que la mayora de los que lo compran no son lectores. Son curiosos que nunca leen el libro ms all de las introducciones. El tema de la alquimia intriga. Adems, es provocante la falsa promesa de realizar los sueos. Con ese mismo tipo de lgica es que se venden los boletos de lotera, a diferencia de que algunos de esos saldrn premiados. <br /> <br />El libro, de alquimia tiene muy poco, excepto que el autor s logr convertir el plomo literario en el oro de la fama y fortuna. <br /> <br />Dichoso l. Es, como algunos de sus personajes diran, suerte de principiante. <br />

B00008PX8P|5.0|Led Zeppelin fans rejoice! After decades of murky bootleg concert footage, the occasional Page/Plant reunion, the sub-par The Song Remains The Same concert film, Zeppelin fans finally have what they've only read in tacky tell-all books or heard tales of yore about from people old enough to have seen them, Led Zeppelin live and in thier prime. <br />    Since Zeppelin's heyday were in the seventies, before MTV, the only video footage available of them wsa the truly God-awful The Song Remains The Same,which, even by thier own admission, was a shoddy, piss-poor collection of material, culled from a series of Madison Square Garden concerts in 1973 hurriedly slapped together and released years later while the band was on hiatus and needed something, anything, out on the market to satisfy rabid fans. <br />    At first your jaw drops at the sheer depth of material Jimmy Page has included on these two discs. Every era is well represented. From the bluesy pan-psychedelia of the late sixties to the booze and drug fueled hard rock stomp of the seventies to the masterful executions of the early eighties. Over the years hard-core Zeppelin fans like me were relegated  to paying big bucks to shady characters for crappy VHS tapes of dubious quality to catch just a slight glimpse of the greatest rock band of all time in concert. Now, the bootleggers must be weeping. With the release of over five hours of material Jimmy Page has exacted sweet revenge by making them, in every sense of the word, irrelevant. <br />    For Page and produccer Dick Caruthers assembling all of this tape must have been a labor of love. Try to imagine how frustrating, tedious, and painstaking the work probably felt, since it surely took them months, maybe years, to sort through thousands of hours of concert footage, old black and white television appearances, 8 milimeter home movies, interviews, deciding what to use and discard, then crossing their fingers and praying the footage didn't melt or shred during the re-mastering process. You have no choice but to marvel at thier technical wizardry. <br />    As for the music, every one of thier best songs are here, sprawling and majestic, and as they were meant to be heard, live. Zeppelin were a band that sounded best in concert. Many musicians make that claim but only a rare few have the skill and acumen to pull it off convincingly. Listen to these versions of 'Achilles Last Stand' or 'Black Dog' and then compare them to the albulm recordings. The live versions posess a depth and complexity, well, more like ferocity, that render the studio tracks sounding like poorly concieved demos. <br />    For me personally disc 2 is my favorite. It features Zep in their prime, 73 to 80 with the Knebworth Festival performance thier finest hour. At this point in thier careers they were being attacked by punks and critics as self indulgent dinosaurs. They responded by stripping down thier arrangements of pretension or artifice and played just straight forward kick-ass hard rock. Robert Plant has said in interviews that Knebworth was Zeppelins greatest moment and he isn't exaggerating, they never sounded more in command of all the elements that rose them above thier contemporaries and transformed them into legends than they did those on those two nights. But the Knebworth footage clocks in at a mere 50 minutes. I wish Page would have included a bit more, like 'Ten Years Gone' or the shimmering 'No Quarter' I have on bootleg, both include instrumental passages you ususally don't get from Rock musicians, but geniuses like Coltrane or Hendrix. I suppose Page has good reasons for these omissions, like time contraints. But these are only minor quibbles. Maybe he can include them in future releases. <br />    Both discs contain hidden nuggets and surprises, none of which I'll reveal here, so you won't be robbed of that moment when, after some searching, you will find them and exclaim \\"Awww Coool!\\" <br />    Page has also placed four versions of 'Dazed and Confused', three versions of 'Communication Breakdown', and two versions of 'Whole Lotta Love' in chronological order beginning early in thier live repertoire, minimalist, stripped down, sounding much like they did on the albulms, then we hear them beginning to grow, to flourish, one member hearing a piece of music another played then improving on it, the four exchanging ideas, pushing one another. They treated songs as just a starting point, a launching pad. The spectacle of Zeppelin, like all the greats, was listening to the risks they took, to the heights they could reach.  <br />    And I have a feeling these two discs, over the years, will surpass all of their previous releases and stand alone as the definitive Led Zeppelin recording.

They have withstood cold, hunger, lack of medical attention and  inadequate housing ----  and  through it all, they keep their sense of humour.<br /><br />A heartwarming story of  human resolve to survive each day by putting  one foot in front of the other. With all his shortcomings, the father left this family  a legacy greater than gold...that is the ability to laugh at themselves.<br /><br />It's a \\"full box of kleenex\\" type of book, as you're either laughing or crying.<br /><br />E. Perry

I am greatful that they still rock and terrorize the world with incredible guitar work and desicrating bass playing and total domination of drum playing. WHOA!

B000005ALN|3.0|This is not a bad album album, it's just not a great one. The first two songs, and the last two, are really the only tracks that stand up to Michael's previous work. All of the pieces are presented with very professional aplomb, and you have to give Michael credit for somewhat broadening his sound (there's even some trip-hop influenced stuff here). Nonetheless, as a whole, this work pales in comparison to, say, Listen Without Prejudice.
B0000028RR|5.0|One of the GREATEST bands that ever set foot on this planet we call Earth! (Led Zepplin and Nirvana don't count, they're from planet ROCKYOURSOCKSOFF!) HAHHAHAHAHHAH! I will laugh and point fingers at anyone who says Rage Against the MAchine was a bad band! They are so intense, they made me cover my ears and take a crap in my pants because it was so awesome! I am the best guy alive! <br /> <br />So to sum up my incomprehensible meander, buy this album! Because man I am so damn drunk! HAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAH <br /> <br />_PEACE OUT AND REMEMBER TO NOT EAT TWINKIES BEFORE SHOOTING VODKA!
B00005JM0B|4.0|Well after 12 whole years of waiting Terminator fans were givin another chance to see Arnie blow some stuff up and survive rediculous amounts of explosions and so on and so forth. Anyway this time Arnie returns as a different cyborg from the same line as the one from the first two (so he doesn't remember all of the fun he shared with Edward Furlong in the second installment). He's back to pretect John Connor (this time played by Nick Stahl) and Kate Brewster (who happens to be a girl from John's past, played by Claire Danes) from Skynet's toughest cyborg the T-X (played by Kristanna Loken).<br /><br />This third installment in the Terminator series dissapointed a lot of T-Fans but not me! It wasn't as good as the first but I honestly thought it was just as good, if not slightly better than #2 (and you can just bite me Ebert). I just thought that the action was all there and it was ther apleanty (just what I expected and wanted from this film too). Now to comment on the acting. Nick Stahl, although he did a good job I just didn't think he was right for the charcter. John Connor is supposed to be a \\"rebel\\" and they even comment on how he is still one today but Stahl didn't come off as that type of guy but rather just a normal guy. Claire Danes did good as well and she was perfect for her part. Kristanna Loken didn't really need to be there, it could have been anyone playing her character...man or women (but she was great to look at). Arnie gives a performance that is all that you'd expect it to be. He is quite funny in the movie too (the line \\"talk to the hand\\" was awesome). The visuals were stunning. But unlike the second one (which broke new grounds in the way of visuals) you see this kind of thing everyday, so it is a very typical action movie style of visuals. The movie was very exciting and action packed. It is one of those movies that makes you fell breathless and makes you fell like you've been out running. Not to mention that it makes you think at points and really brings the \\"Terminator\\" saga to new levels.<br /><br />I don't know what everybody's problem with this was. It was a fun, action-packed ride that won't be forgotten (and Ebert can just shove it).<br /><br />~This review originally appeared on my \\"Yahoo Movies\\" file metalhead_movieman~d really brings the \\"Terminator\\" saga to new levels. <br /> <br />I don't know what everybody's problem with this was.

Dude, if you want to buy an album that actually has people playing their heart and soul out and pouring dark and powerful emotions into music, then do yourself a favor and walk (or drive) to the local fye and by the damn album! <br /> <br />Alice in Chains are so good that they have actually inspired others that created knock-offs (aka Godsmack, Nickelback, Black Label Society, etc) and other things. Alice in Chains is one of the world's premiere bands and no one will ever match their darkness, sadness, and sickening lyrics that could make anyone barf with angry rage and say: <br /> <br />\\"Holy Schnike!

1559277246|5.0|I think  the Hard Eight was very entertaining!  It continues to portray Stephanie as a cluster, but always lands on her feet.  Lucky girl having Morelli and Ranger!! (yummy).  It is  entertaining because if something bad is going to happen, it happens to her....but she always gets to run to Morelli or Ranger and  they fix the situation.  Evanovich has written her character to be a realist, she is not rich or famous and she does not care what people think.  It is a fun book!
B00005JNTX|5.0|I thought that Sin City was an instant classic. I thought that Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller had made an awesome movie. I also thought that the guest directing of Quentin Tarantino was amazing. Even though I haven't seen Kill Bill Vol. 1 or 2, I think that Sin City will be a great film for the ages. Also, the cast all played amazing roles in the movie and the casting directors all picked the right people for the movie. Here is my review about the casting and the directors job: <br /> <br />First off, the casting call was an amazing job. I thought that when I saw the movie that they looked actually like the real comic. Hartigan (Bruce Willis) is saving a girl named Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) from a bunch of killers. First off, I thought that the casting of Bruce Willis and Nancy Callahan as Jessica Alba was an amazing choice because he has the scar and he has the look and everything. I think that this story was an amazing choice because Bruce going against the Yellow Bastard was an awesome scene and a story.  <br /> <br />In the beginning, The Man (Josh Hartnett) and Shellie (Brittany Murphy) start talking about the city and how much of a sin it is. Then, The Man shoots Shellie, but she lives and the movie starts. <br /> <br />Then it starts off with Marv (Mickey Rourke) getting with a girl named Goldie (Jaime King). Then, she dies with no scars and no bruises by a guy named Kevin (Elijah Wood). First, the casting of Mickey Rourke of Marv was like it just happened for him because I thought that he looked exactly like Marv. So, Marv goes on a rampage and goes looking for the killer of Goldie until he meets up with a girl named Wendy who is the twin of Goldie. The two go on a rampage and get the killer Kevin. In the end, Marv is in trouble with the cops and the people. In the end, he is in prison with an electric chair and he is dead. Goldie and Kevin were great casting calls for the movie.  <br /> <br />The second and final (since I told the last one), is aboutpeople named Dwight, Shellie, and Jackie Boy. Dwight (Clive Owen) is on a run to save the hookers of Sin City and trying to get the head of Jackie Boy, that the cops have so far. Shellie (Brittany Murphy) is in the beginning of this story trying to stop Jackie Boy (Bencio Del Toro) to abusing her. When Jackie Boy goes to the bathroom, Dwight goes and kills him, not knowing that he is a cop. When he finds out that he is a cop, he's got to stop the rest of the cops so that they don't find out about his head. He teams up with Miho (Devon Aoki) to save the person that he loves who happens to be Gail (Rosario Dawson) from Manute (Michael Clarke Duncan) and the person that told them, Becky (Alexis Bledel). Although Becky lives, the rest of the cops die and Gail and Dwight are happily together in Sin City.  <br /> <br />I think that Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino did an amazing job making this a black and white movie with some color (kind've like the comic). Although, when I first heard of this movie, I wasn't really excited to see this movie. Then, I read some reviews and heard from people that this is an awesome movie. I watched it and it is way better than most of the movies that I have seen lately. Great casting calls for all of the people and make sure that you go and you watch this movie because you will not be dissapointed. <br /> <br />In a rating for this movie out of ten, it will give it a 9/10.  <br /> <br />Rated R for sustained strong stylized violence, nudity, and sexual content including dialogue.
B00006RU5B|2.0|So you say this band is comprised of memebers of Rage Against the Machine, one of the most innovative metal bands of all time, and Soundgarden, probably the best grunge band of all time?  Well, what are you expecting? <br /> <br />Are you expecting either: <br />A) FAST-PACED guitars, SWEET basslines, KICKIN' drums, and some IN YOUR FACE vocals/rapping/lyrics? or... <br />B) SLOW, GRINDING guitars, DEEP, DARK bass, INTENSE drumming, and DEPRESSING vocals/lyrics?  or... <br />C) A REALLY boring band. <br /> <br />If you're expecting A or B, don't be surprised that Audioslave is probably the most boring band you'll ever hear.  If you're expecting C, you're in for a treat!  They're just PRETTY boring, and easily ignorable.
B0007VCZ50|5.0|I was very pleased to see \\"Bring on the Night\\" released on DVD. I remember seeing this movie in the theaters many years ago and always wondered why it hadn't made it to digital, but no more!  <br />     The viewer can ignore the \\"dramatic\\" subtext of the movie (\\"Can Sting, risking his career, make it as a solo artist playing with jazz musicians?\\"; I think that the answer was never in that much doubt)that they try to establish through a series of interviews with Sting and others. Sting is overly stiff and didactic (and, frankly, boring!); the only guilty pleasure is seing Miles Copeland (his manager) run roughshod over evryone who is not Sting.  <br />      This movie is about the band and the music that they create. All of the band members are exceptionally strong; you can see and feel the pleasure that they get from playing with each other (check out Omar Hakim's smile as he solos in the middle of \\"Burn for You\\"). The set list draws from (for me) Sting's best solo work and some tasty new arrangements of Police hits (the plaintive \\"Message in a Bottle\\" stands out). But the best thing in this movie is the FUNKY jazz groove that the band adds to Sting's compositions. Check out the extended jams on \\"Consider Me Gone\\" and \\"Bring on the Night.\\" <br />      In short, if you want to see and hear musicians playing great songs WITH, not against or over, each other (listen to Branford Marsalis' sax support the melody and the message of \\"Fortress Around Your Heart\\"), check out this movie.
B0009KA7BS|3.0|I dont want people to be Mad at me when I say this wasent a very good movie. For all you people who are obssesed with this movie and will kill anyone who gives it a bad review, I recomend that you not read the following review.<br /><br />Anyway Constantine is really confusing. It follows a Exorsist trying to buy back his way into heaven because he has done so much bad stuff. He meets a girl who is determined to find out why her sister has comited suicide, so she askes for Constantine's help.<br /><br />I am not saying this movie was horrible but it just wasent that good. I give it 3.5 stars because the special effects and action was relly cool, but the story line wasen't.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review, I hope it was helpful.

B000957O82|5.0|Hitch is a wonderful romantic comedy focusing in on two relationships in the show. Will Smith is at his best in this movie, and works along with a spectacular cast. Hitch is a perfect comedy movie. I love it. If you havent seen it yet I would rent it first, but if you have seen it and you like it I would highly recomend buying it.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review, I hope it was helpful.
0385338686|5.0|I've always read non fiction.  I've always thought books like this were meaningless fluff~I was wrong.  The author writes in a great, easy, flowing style, you get so caught up in the totally ridiculous but cannot put it down story. This book is a great escape from everyday stresses.
B0001L3MI0|5.0|The story is a little weak in some places but it is a solid one.  I won't go into the storyline as dozens of people before me have already done that.  This however is one of the better bad guy alien movies...
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Abruptly violent non stop action with few glimpses of normalcy then many brilliantly hyper visual effects...you are taken on a wild roller coaster ride laughing uncontrollably during all the bloody battles & the ridiculously cool caricatures of bizzaro ordinary citizens with super kung pao powers. LMAO ! Eccentric and zany - best film since the Gods must be crazy and lock stock and two smoking barrels... Action comedy without borders as every culture watching this can relate..
B00005JKJA|5.0|*spoilers* <br /> <br />Taken conventionally, the first 2/3rd of Mulholland Drive tells a compelling (albeit fractured) tale of murder, sex, amnesia, Hollywood corruption, and mistaken identity.  Then the last 1/3 flips over on itself...Characters change, and the plot seemingly exists in an alternate universe.  The one complaint (I'm not even sure it can be considered a legitimate flaw) is that the true power of Mulholland Drive (which is only partially the compelling murder-mystery stuff) won't make any sense until you know the twist, becasue the twist informs everything that came before it, and logically and emotionally ties everything together.  Because of this, the film MUST be seen at least twice... <br /> <br />So what is the surprise?  Everything in the first 2/3rds is a dream.  Before that sounds lame, I can honestly say that Muholland Drive is unlike any other film I've ever seen.  Why?  Because it uses dreams to explore a character by inhabiting their psyche completely, telling a story from the inside out.  Everything you see in the first 2/3rds exists within the unconscious of Diane Selwyn (Naomi Watts).  Thus every little weird turn of event, every erotic encounter, every nightarmish scenario sheds light on who she is, her aspirations, and her fears.  The 3rd of the film shows reality as it actually exists and thus correlates the associations Diane's dreaming brain makes with the reality of her miserable, tormented existence.  Even the illogical moments of the film make sense within the logic that it was dreamt and associated with something in Diane's actual life.   <br /> <br />That is where the beauty and power of the film lies.  We see inside a character so completely.  It's an almost frighteningly intimate filmgoing experience at times, especially as Diane is repeatedly humiliated in the third act.  And the adventurous joy of the first act is imbued with a tender sense of melancholy as it is a doomed fantasy of a happiness that can never exist. Lynch's template can take him anywhere, and thus he goes everywhere.  Mulholland Drive is a meditation on dreams, on the Hollywood machine that chews and spits out wanna-be starlets, and a profoundly jealous and disturbed personality.   <br /> <br />As for the performances...You've all heard how good Naomi Watts is in this film.  I can assure you that the praise is justified and more.  Like Lynch, her performance goes anywhere and everywhere, to the depths of despair to triumphant moments of one's greatest narcissistic realization, to...you fill in the blank.  It's an outstanding, phenomenal performance. Laura Harring is great too, but in a more conventional way.  Her amnesiac Rita makes an appealing femme fatale, but because Rita/Camilla only exists within Diane's warped psyche, this is really not a character exploration as in-depth as Watts'.  Still, a damn fine performance.   <br /> <br />Upon repeated viewings, Mulholland Drive reveals itself to be a pitch-perfect masterpiece.  From the concept to the performances, Mulholland Drive is a phenomenal movie.
B00005JKC3|1.0|If one day you find yourself stuck on some desert island, bereft of books and companions, but with a fully working DVD player and a copy of this movie -- and nothing but tedious years stretching ahead of you as you wait to be rescued . . . don't watch it.<br /><br />It wouldn't be worth your time.
B00005JN5X|2.0|I'm a big Terry Gilliam fan, so the sense of disappointment (nay, betrayal) that I felt watching The Brothers Grimm put me into a deep funk.  There really is nothing to recommend this movie.  The story is a mish-mash, the characters are tinny and weak, the acting is, at best, passable. The whole thing feels like a weak drink, watered-down Brazil with a dash of Tim Burton shallowness.<br /><br />If I had to pick the weakest part of the thing, it has to be the script. It's unevolved, never fully realized, like a amateur's third draft: lacking the life of the first and chock full of bad items that someone thought might make it ideosyncratic.  And it never finds its footing, its tone. It drifts from slightly funny to to mildly strange to loud and conventional.  What makes this all the more disheartening is that the story concept has great potential -- charlatan ghostbusters coming face to face with the real thing.  And this movie, sadly, even borrows from Ghostbusters, with a silly scene involving a character who looks like a chocolate-dipped Stay-Puft® Marshmallow Man.<br /><br />I'll wait for Terry's next film before carving my disappointment in anything permanent.  This movie looks and feels like Terry was asleep at the switch, like he was going through the motions. Like some numb Hollywood committee was at the controls.<br /><br />Here's hoping.

B00005J6SZ|5.0|Many  recording artists have fallen victim to the Sophmore Slump. They release a great debut, and expectations for a follow up are high. They are rushed into the studio to record another smash hit album. And it bombs. It happens all the time. This, I can assure you, is the exception that prooves that rule. Hooks galore, incredibly  tight music ( courtesy mostly of the Chic rhythm section, plus producer/guitarist Nile Rodgers ) catchy choruses, provocative ( for their time )  lyrics. The album cover  is brilliant in both its aesthetic beauty ( the sepia tone photo is a classic ) and its blatant attempt to stun and shock ( Madonna, in a wedding dress, with a belt buckle that says \\"Boy Toy\\", I am sure made parents across America wonder what was inside this album their teens were bringing home.)This remains Madonna's best selling album and for good reason. No less than four hit singles. And the album cuts are great too. The ballad \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\" ( a cover of an old Rose Royce hit) contains one of her best vocal performances, and \\"Shoo Be Doo\\", despite its rather puerile lyrics, has a great vocal hook.  She would go on to loftier critical success ( eventually winning the coveted Grammy for Pop Album of the Year for her \\"Ray of Light\\" ) but this is the real begining of Madonna Mania. This remastered edition doesn't really add much in the way of sonic improvement ( it was originally digitally recorded anyway ) but does contain the 12\\" mixes of the two best known singles, the title track, and \\"Material Girl\\". If you are one of the very few who don't have this already, and are a fan of pop music, I can wholeheartedly recommend \\"Like A Virgin\\".
B00006J3KT|5.0|Where do you start to list the immense contributions of David Bowie to music in general.  Never truly original to begin with but constantly borrowing from others to eventually come up with a very original product, the man still sounds and looks good to this day.  I saw him last year in concert and I thought he was even better than over ten years ago, the last time I saw him in concert.<br /><br />Anyways about the discs, get this 2 -disc version because the sound quality is really good and they really did a good remastering job here.  Also, 2 discs are good enough as the 3 disc version out there is really for collectors and rabid fans and it's mostly filler.<br /><br />Get this UK version too because the U.S. version inexplicably leaves out very good tracks like \\"Sorrow\\" and I believe, \\"Wild is the Wind\\" both indispensable tracks in any Bowie retrospective.  Even the Pet Shop Boys rendition of \\"Hello Spaceboy\\" is great here as all the tracks are great choices to include on the 2 discs and never sounded better.<br /><br />This is I think the best Bowie compilation that is out there so get this disc as well as remastered versions of \\"Ziggy\\" and \\"Hunky Dory\\" and you'll be happy as a clam!  Cheers!
B000063V8T|5.0|This was the best season, hands down, of TNG. There's just no comparison. <br /> <br />Stardate 45020.4 \\"Redemption, Pt. 2\\" The second part of season 4's finale.

Excellent. 5 stars <br /> <br />I love this season...the next one is almost as good, but not quite.
B00005L8Y9|5.0|The Duke and Trane together!  Who would have thunk it!  Anyway, the very well Japanese remastered version with the cool gatefold case is worth getting.  The playing of the aging Duke seems a little subdued and Trane plays as if in awe of the master but still very listenable and a worthy addition to any jazz collection.  Glad I got this before they were all sold out!  Good sound, good tunes, good packaging all good reasons to get this disc.
0393317552|5.0|Rather than rehash the geographic determinism, cultural determinism, and racial determinism debates (you can read that in the other reviews), I will simply give you a flavor for the book by offering you my favorite quote (from page 399 of the 1999 edition): <br /> <br />\\"Had Africa's rhinos and hippos been domesticated and ridden, they would not only have fed armies but also have provided an unstoppable cavalry to cut through the ranks of European horsemen.  Rhino-mounted Bantu shock troops could have over-thrown the Roman Empire.  It never happened.\\" <br /> <br />Now that's quite a mental picture! <br />
B0007MUR2W|5.0|Thank you Dr Toby Mountain!  He's the dude that's credited with the digital mastering of this RykoDisc version of Bowie's classic album.  I remember owning this on cassette too and it still sounded great!<br /><br />Anyways, this disc with the extra tracks especially \\"John, I'm Only Dancing\\" and \\"Velvet Goldmine\\" is a really good one to get.  I see it's out of print but the other remastered versions out there make me wonder whether it's worth it getting them when this version is so very good already.<br /><br />Great tracks and great sound so I'm holding on to this version that I have until they truly come up with a good reason for me to get another version.  Mmm, maybe something with the same tracks but remastered and coming in a Japanese, LP-style miniature slipcase?  Might just do it...<br /><br />In case you haven't yet heard Ziggy and are wondering what this is all about, wonder no longer and get yourself a copy, even if it's a used RykoDisc version, it's still good.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that this is at least as good as if not better than \\"Sgt. Pepper's...\\"  for too many reasons to be mentioned here in this review.  Maybe, I'll write an article someday if someone will pay me for it... : )

B000A5DV42|5.0|\\"Road to Rouen\\" is an excellent collection of songs from the most consistently talented and clever bands to grace the planet this past decade.  For those who would compare this release to previous efforts, it is not as brazen and crackling as \\"Coco\\", nor is it as filled with new energy and momentum as \\"In It For The Money.\\"  It shares a little of the melancholy sound and dark atmosphere of \\"X-Ray\\" and has very little in common (style-wise) with \\"Life on Other Planets.\\"  It is a well-scripted and marvelously conceived journey through new territory.<br /><br />This release can be divided into two primary sections...  The first begins with \\"Tales of Endurance - Parts 4, 5 and 6\\" which can be seen as a testament to Supergrass as a band that has spent the last decade and more re-defining music with sometimes little recognition for the brilliance embodied by their efforts.  Clever tongue-in-cheek sarcasm pokes fun at themselves as well as the vision over success approach to music.  A wide variety of instruments abound with the three parts shifting gears from a western-style guitar building eventually into a solid rock production.<br /><br />The first half of the release continues with \\"St. Petersburg\\" which is a piano-led gentle roller that features a stunning array of late 60's-style instruments including a splendid string section and a kind of strolling pace.<br /><br />\\"Sad Girl\\" uses a brilliant organ-laden foundation to tell its story.  The steady beat leads the song along as it moves from one section to another.  I know I am not alone in favorably comparing this one to the latter Beatles efforts, when the genius was at its most uncaring of public acceptance.<br /><br />The last song of the first half, \\"Roxy\\" is an amazing song.  Again, it is not a rocker as much as it is a symphony Supergrass-style.  I can't express how superb this song is.  The complex and stirring orchestral sound that accompanies the majority of the song add a majesty to the music that has not been captured by a band in such a long time.  It rocks out to its conclusion ending the first half of a brilliant release.<br /><br />\\"Coffee in the Pot\\" is the instrumental intermission.  It is meant to be a light buffer between the first half which builds up to \\"Roxy\\" before moving on to the second act.  This song is short, humorous and included for the sole purpose of drawing a line between one side of the \\"record\\" and the other.<br /><br />The title track is a solid seventies-style rocker with a police-chase-through-the-streets-of-San Francisco soundtrack and an occasionally Bowie-esque lyrical style.  Complete with a little siren sound-byte thrown in the more quiet moments, and a driving beat, this is one of the heavier tracks as far as setting a groove.<br /><br />\\"Kick in the Teeth\\" is the closest Supergrass comes to giving fans a taste of their previous catchy verse, defined chorus style of music.  It shows that while the Wheatly lads have developed an even more versatile sound, they are still capable of throwing a bone to the fans stuck in a previous era of Supergrass.<br /><br />At this point the songs begin to wind to a close.  \\"Low C\\" is a somewhat Lennon-sounding song that uses a light piano and a kind of tavern-band drum beat (similar to the beat and tempo of \\"Sex\\") to roll along.<br /><br />The final song, appropriately titled \\"Fin\\", quietly closes the release.  It is soft and filmy and filled with such a sense of the sublime it leaves you with a sense of loss akin to reading the last page of a beloved book.<br /><br />This may need a few listens to grow on people expecting a heavier rock-and-roll or pop sound.  \\"Road to Rouen\\" may not be the greatest thing ever released by Supergrass, but that is only because they have put out such brilliant material over the past decade and more.  It is more complex than anything they've done to date, but if you run through it a few times you will see that it is a marvel in it's own right.  It is not a long-playing release, but at just over 35 minutes, it is long enough to express all of the elements without losing its soul.  I think it is a stunning addition to their catalog.not a long-playing release, but at just over 35 minutes, it is long enough to express all of the elements without losing its soul.

1586216880|4.0|I had to read the book for a class so I purchased the audio to go along with it to help speed things up.  The audio  follows the book's order, but skips over sections here and there.  As a stand alone audio, it flows just nicely and was very enlightening.
B00079FUI6|2.0|I am not the only one to admit the fact that Desperate Housewifes is way to overated.  Desperate started off great.  I was like, \\"wow that was really funny and good,\\" after the pilot.  The show had everything, comedy, drama, a killer cast (except for one, I'll get to that later), and plot, something television hasn't seen in awhile since realit TV has taken over.  The show was fantasic for the first half of the season, then without warning the show steadily got more and more boring (kind of like LOST did, see other review)  the mystery about Mary Alice was getting old, and I really think that the cast and crew knew that.  Then after 8 months came, the most highly anticipated fanali, when that episode finished I felt like I had just watched an episode of The Golden Girls, IT WAS HORRIBLE.  What...after months of watching that was their kick ass fanali.  Not only did the answer about Mary Alice suck, but the cliffhanger(if you could even call it that) just sucked.  Now for the cast.  Eva, Nicolette, Marcia, and Felicity keep up the good work (Felicity (Lynett) should win the emmy).  As for the \\"star\\" of the show Terri Hatcher, her acting lacks what the others have, she isn't believable as a person.  Terri Hatcher won the Golden Globe because she is considered the \\"star\\" of the show, not becuase of her acting, if it was based on that, the only award she might win is a rasberry award(award given out to bad actresses).  Overall the show is just ok, I'll still watch next year, maybe they won't screw up the mystery.  I will however not purchase this dvd.  If you want to watch entertaining shows watch, ALIAS, and Veronica Mars, becuase honestly these are the shows that should be getting the buzz, not a show about women who just complain way to much
0792846443|4.0|**UPDATE: I wrote the below review in 2005 in response to the 2000 DVD release of Misery, which was non-anamorphic widescreen and lacking bonus features.  That was the second time it has been released on DVD, so the continued shoddy treatment by MGM was unacceptable and I gave it 2 stars out of 5.  Perhaps somebody was listening, because as I predicted in my review, MGM released a \\"Collector's Edition\\" DVD in 2007 that finally included an HDTV-friendly transfer and bonus features.  As of 2014, both of DVD releases are available from Amazon.  Be sure to pick up the 2007 Collector's Edition DVD if you have (or ever plan on having) a widescreen TV.  Since MGM did eventually did make things right, I'm increasing my rating from two starts to four.**       (Original review)    This is the 2nd release of Misery on DVD and MGM still didn't bother to create an anamorphic (enhanced for 16x9) widescreen transfer.  The widescreen version offered here is non-anamorphic letterboxed, so widescreen-TV buyers beware.  The print they had to work with is decent, but nowhere near perfect.   One of the better King adaptations, largely due to Caan and Bates, but only 2 stars for a second lame DVD transfer.  It will be interesting to see if MGM releases it for a 3rd time in an anamorphic special edition, or if they will just wait for the inevitable high definition release.
B00005JNTX|1.0|I will confess, I have never read Sin City comic strips, but I think the movie industry should have chosen a different comic strip to make a movie about.  I decided to watch this movie because the credicts raved about this movie, to me after watching it--a very big disappointment.  Here are things that I did not like about the movie.  First, Bruce Willis acts exactly same no matter which movie he is in.  He has one facial expression for everything. When I thought he was killed of very early in the movie, I became very happy thinking that I don't have to put up with him anymore, but he came back towards end of the movie. I generally don't watch any movies with him in it.  Second, I heard some professional movie credict say that the running scene in which Bruce runs through the forest was a great scene, because it was done with a forest back drop and that he was not actually running throught the woods.  Well, after watching this scence, my friends and I thought it was not a big deal.  In fact, the whole scene looked very fake to us.  It actually look like a fake back drop was moving while he was just running in one place.  I think it would have looked better if he was really running in the woods.  Third, the white brightness of the movie really bothered my eyes.  I had a hard time keeping my eyes on the movie,  Fourth, The dialog was just oful, more of one liners throughout the whole movie.  Fifth, When a crook throws a garnade, some people got killed and others who were blown clear away had not even one scratches on them and they were perfectly fine.  Some people got shot many times in the chest and got killed, while others got the same thing but just walked away.  Sixth, Why does all the girls including the female pro officer walked around wearing skanky clothes.  Almost all the females in the movie were prostutes.  No wonder the females in the real life have a tough time being taken seriously.  This movie was nothing but violence, nudity, bad dialog, bad acting, bad lighting, and confusion.  I would not recommend this trash to anyone.

B00005AR3G|5.0|This too is a movie that can be appreciated by both children and adults the moral content high, its totally hilarous,and its lesson is obvious \\"act like and ass and you might become one\\". Good stuff

1573223026|1.0|Using 'A Long Way Down' as an example, Rod Liddle wrote an excellent article about the problem with contemporary English literature,    I think what he says is spot on. For me, this book lacks quality in every way. The characters are totally unengaging, the dialogue is bad and it fails to tackle serious and potentially rich themes with any depth or intelligence. Essentially, this a book with no balls. It reads like a script for a bad Hollywood movie. I read this just to see how bad it was and whether I agree with Rod Liddle, and I find my suspicions confirmed. This is feelgood pap with dismally unabsorbing characters, a book completely lacking in depth. Although I have never been much of a fan of Nick Hornby I read High Fidelity a few years ago, and remember it being a lot better than this, if insipid nonetheless. I would say this effort shows that he should stick to what he does best; writing lite cosmo-friendly novels about breakups, relationships, and the like. Had Nick Hornby not already become a very bankable household name following the success of his previous work, I'm sure this would never have found its way into print. I can't imagine anybody I would consider interesting or intelligent being impressed by this book.
B00003CXI1|5.0|My children ages 3 and 5 love this movie!  They have watched it over and over and can't get enough of it.  My son just started getting into Harry Potter and now my daughter loves it too.  It brings much to the imagination.
