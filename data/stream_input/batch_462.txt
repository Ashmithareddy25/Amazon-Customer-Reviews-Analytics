B0002V7ODI|5.0|The theatrical cut was good, four stars. But now, thanks to the added minutes, the story and the characters get the time to develop the way they should have. The love story between Liz and Hellboy finally makes sense, the dark forces receive more depth and the humor hits you harder because you finally get the time to laugh without fearing to lose the story. Mignola did wonderful work with the comic books. His art and storytelling are splendid. G.del Toro obviously respects and loves the comics and in adding his own wit, grace and professionalism makes this film one of the very best comic-to-films. Ron Perlman shaving his horns .... my favorite scene of the year!
B000002JSR|4.0|Some great tunes that didn't make the other albums.  A MUST have for TRUE Zep fans who want more!
1565847032|4.0|If I were judging this book on bravery, accessability and scope, it would get an easy 5 stars. I liked the edited-interviews format very much.  <br /> <br />Many things he says are dead-on accurate and represent the best of free speech, particularly  in how he dissects the motivations of the power brokers. Having said that, I think he's more a polemicist and dilettante than a serious intellect. He leaves out all kinds of facts and counterweights and seems to have a superficial understanding of many issues, e.g. he mischaracterized the Cuban Missile Crisis, leaving out Soviet fears that Kennedy was not in control of his Army and incorrectly claims that Cubans, rather than Russian generals, were in control of mobile-launched nukes in Cuba.  <br /> <br />...but at least he's out there speaking his mind. A rare quality these days.
078693123X|5.0|I've read this book, and wow everything was excellent there weren't ANY boring parts, one thing just led on to another. It's about a dark elf named Drizzt Do'Urden who is born in the Underdark of Menzoberranzen, sorry for the spelling error. There are houses in Menzoberranzen Do'Urden being the third house in favor of the Spider Queen, until Drizzt Do'Urden is born. Drizzt is born with lavender eyes and doesn't have any bad reaction toward light. As he grows older he grows compassion, understanding, and cleverness, yet he does not know how the dark elves are with hatefullness because of his father's protection for Drizzt's innocence. Later in the book he becomes the best swordsman in the underdark, like his father. Drizzt and his father share the same feelings, but Drizzt's father had to live in guilt and shame. Drizzt doesn't want to live the same way so he runs away from the Underdark with Gwen, the panther leaving the house Do'Urden in ruins.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|Wooow! Dark, tough, violent. But also so much more funny than the theatrical version. By adding the additional minutes and scenes (even a complete small story on the side) this movie finally gets the pace it needs. Slow at times, to let you suck in the characters, then all of a sudden the pace takes off, taking you with it through the dark and rainy skies over Hell's Kitchen and into the depth's of Daredevil's soul. Terrific!!!
B000002UAU|5.0|I'm only fourteen and recently found myself knee-deep in Beatles. I love every song, and all the songs. I've never even heard most of the songs the Beatles did and yet i LOVE all of this CD. <br />the weird thing is that the whole Segerant peper's band thing came from wanting to be normal - like not be super stars!!! Like they thought it acutally might have worked!!!
B0002SROT0|4.0|Sadly, too often the great songwriters of our generation get overlooked by the public at large. Elliot was never a million-seller during his life, despite the endless critical acclaim, but I hope that more people will discover his music now that he is gone. \\"From a Basement...\\" is not a polished and complete as \\"XO\\", but it is a great rock album by any standard, and it is a fitting farewell album that is reminiscent of Jeff Buckley's \\"Sketches for my Sweetheart\\".<br /><br />\\"From a Basement...\\" is perhaps Elliot's darkest album to date, and knowing what we know now, it reads almost like a suicide note. \\"Pretty (Ugly Before)\\" is sad, almost self-deprecating in tone, while songs like \\"A Fond Farewell\\" and \\"King's Crossing\\" make direct references to suicide (\\"I can't prepare for death anymore than I already have\\" and \\"This is not my life, just a fond farewell to a friend\\" are two examples). Like \\"XO\\" and the more eclectic \\"Figure 8\\", Elliot's lyrics speak louder than the music. He was a brilliant songwriter, perhaps one of the most honest and telling songwriters of our generation. I would rank him up there with Kurt Cobain, Jeff Buckley, and Nick Drake. Musically, \\"From a Basement...\\" ranges from mellow acoustic to the heart-stopping rock that made his prior songs like \\"Sweet Adeline\\" and \\"Baby Britain\\" so moving. Next to \\"XO\\", this is Elliot's best work, with each song standing out in it's own way, and each one as lyrically brilliant as the next one and the quality of the music being consistent throughout the album's fifteen tracks.<br /><br />Fans of Elliot's music will definitely be satisfied with this album, as it maintains his level of quality despite being unfinished at the time of his death. People who are new to his music should start with \\"XO\\" and this album, as they are both very similar, and then move on to his other works like \\"Either/Or\\" and \\"Figure 8\\". Highly recommended.
B000002HHB|5.0|I have owned this CD for almost ten years now and still get astounded when listening to it every once in a while. The 90's were a cynical decade, full of exciting and unexpected things and this CD is indeed something else. While listening to it you'll find the cynicism expressed in song  like  \\"San Andreas Fault\\", \\"Wonder\\" and \\"Cowboy Romance\\", but also deep loss - \\"Beloved Wife\\", \\"The Letter\\", regret -\\"Jealousy\\", \\"Seven Years\\"-and soothing places \\"Where I go\\". The lyrics still pack a lot of punch, the arrangements are beautiful and understated and the voice of Natalie Merchant lures you and guides you through the whole affair without you even noticing. This is still my favorite Natalie Merchant CD.
B00005Y7L4|1.0|I ordered this through Import CD Specialists and got a DVD which cannot be viewed on the North American system. Read the fine print!
B0006399FS|5.0|If you are going to judge this whole album on the basis of Vertigo, you have got it all wrong. That song is fun, fluffy radio and I-Pod friendly stuff, but there is so much more to this album.  This is deep, heartfelt work that is right up there with the best music they have ever created.  Some of the standouts in my opinion are \\"Miracle Drug\\", \\"One Step Closer\\" and \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own\\". In the album sleeve there was special thanks given to Noel Gallagher on \\"One Step Closer\\" so you Oasis fans should find something to like as well.  Peace
B0002XVSRE|5.0|I'm still on the fence about the entire disc of \\"Bomb,\\" but this apparently extra song \\"Fast Cars\\" is the best thing in the past 15 years!<br /><br />I've listened to it 5 times in a row now, and I'll probably listen to it 5 more times!  The drums are Moroccan, the entire Mideastern vibe just makes your feets \\"get 'mobin!\\"<br /><br />Why didn't they make this a single?  I can't believe they made this an \\"extra\\" song, when it's the most rocking tune on the whole disc.<br /><br />:):)
B00005JN0T|3.0|I'm not a Will Smith fan (unless your talking about DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince) and I really wanted to hate this movie.  This stems from the fact that Mr. Smith is not an actor as he is a personality and (for the most part) most people could not name any character he has played. It's just Will Smith in a movie about such and such.  With that said, back to my point, I was ready to hate this movie.  I was surprised to find that Alex Proyas directed this (as well as the superb Dark City) and the story (while not any kind of ground breaking Sci-Fi) was strongly rooted in the Sci-Fi and Mystery genres.  It unfolded well and was interesting, heck, even Will was good as Detective Spooner (Yes he gets props for actually acting, even if it was still just a sombre paranoid version of himself).  Ok, it had it's holes, but not too many.  Oddly enough it was the \\"stylized\\" action sequences that failed the story to me and they just seemed to be out of place in this straight forward Sci-Fi piece.  Also the Mystery side of it never really panned out.  The movie does have it's charm, though and if this is any indication of the status of the blockbuster movies coming out of Hollywood right now, then at least that's a good thing.  Again, not great and not nearly as \\"smart\\" as it wants to be but far better than the usual Hollywood faire.
B0001HAHXW|4.0|OK, let's be moderate here people. All the other reviews I've read of this album have been rather excitable and have missed the point, in my humble opinion. I'm an avid fan of Clapton and Robert Johnson & I'd argue that no one understands Johnson like Clapton - he's certainly spread his music further than any other and is the medium through which I discovered the King of the Delta Blues.  <br />For those of you who have been saying that Clapton can never do RJ justice - that wonderful little truism misses the point of this album. It's not meant to do it justice... look at Clapton's last few albums - they're there to please him rather than any of us. If we like them, great; if not, he's not bothered. I think that this album concludes a journey of sorts and does so wonderfully. If you dig what you hear then something has been achieved and Clapton's done his job of converting the masses to the seminal recordings of Robert Johnson.  <br />For those of you who say this album is rubbish because EC's weak and has lost his rock n roll guts etc - you too have missed the point. Listen harder. He did this for him, not us. Forget that it's Eric Clapton for a second and just listen to the music, then go out and buy a Robert Johnson album and get ye healed. <br />It's all classic stuff but has to be put in its perspective. It wasn't meant to be a return to rock stardom by EC or an exact copy of the hard livin' Mississippi blues master. If it is either then great but that wasn't the point. [BTW, if you want to hear Clapton do almost exact copies of Johnson's work check out the Unplugged disc.]
B000099T2L|3.0|I like Destiny's Child. I like Beyonce. I think she's beautiful and has a wonderful voice. But I don't understand why Destiny's Child have had a curse on them since there biggest album to date, \\"The Writings On The Wall\\". That whole album was slamming and everybody and their momma (my momma included) were listening to it but since they ditched LaToya and LaTavia they haven't caught magic much, still...still yes they have had some excellent songs since the breakup and addition of Michelle Williams like \\"Survivor\\", \\"Bootylicious\\" and \\"Independent Women\\" but I was a trifle dissapointed in \\"Survivor\\"-The Album. It started with gusto and then faded into...ahem..crap. Same goes for Kelly's solo debut album, \\"Simply Deep\\" and same goes for Beyonce's. The girls have talent for slammin' and bangin' first singles (especially their newest release for \\"Destiny Fullfield\\"-\\"Lose My Breath\\" and \\"Solider\\" which are crazy good) and then the rest of the album isn't much to listen to.  <br />Beyonce, not to dog her or anything, I had alot of high hopes for and thought that she would have come out with a-groupstar gone solostar-success, she did... but half-way.  <br />The beginnings of \\"Dangerously In Love\\" are just fantastic. The first single \\"Crazy In Love\\" exploded in the Spring of 2003. Then the groovin' and sensual notes of \\"Baby Boy\\" feat. Sean Paul were heard. Followed by the smooth and quiet anger of \\"Me, Myself and I\\". Other standouts were the funky and upbeat, \\"Naugthy Girl\\", the quirky \\"Hip-Hop Star\\" feat. Big Boi and Sleepy Brown and the 70's sounding slow jam, \\"Be With You\\" but then after that it all goes down the drain. I should make an exception with \\"The Closer I Get To You\\" feat. Luther Vandross, which is good but the rest like \\"Signs\\" (why do a song about each zodiac sign?) and \\"Yes\\" (which is annoying) are just so bad that you scratch your head and wonder did Beyonce take a nap while recording this last part. \\"Speechless\\" and \\"Dangerously In Love Pt.2\\" (why?) are great songs that help with insomnia...I forget the rest of this album due to it's boring ending.  <br />Now I do think that Beyonce has talent and I think she has deserved every award she has gotten, including her Grammys (except for best female R&B album or something like that)but for her next outing she needs to come AND go out with a bang not half-way do it.
B0000029GA|5.0|If you consider yourself to be a fan of hip hop and dont own this cd then your just F'n yourself. This is with out a doubt the most classic of all of hip hop albums, no collection is complete with out it. If you dont like this cd cuz you think its got 'poor production' or whatever then i suggest you get your cracker *** self back to your home in the suburbs and bump your g-unit cd and be happy. But dont come up here and talk all this jazz about this cd is weak or whatever cuz in reality it is classic and nobody is touchin it.

B00004Z459|5.0|This album is really cool, when it released, I was a 10-year-old girl, but I just love Linkin Park because this wonderful album. When I first time listen \\"Papercut\\", I just love it, it's hip-hop but not all of, Mike Shinoda's rap is so HOTT, and Chester's voice is so SEXY! \\"One Step Closer\\" is the COOLEST song of Linkin Park, and other songs are very good,too! This is a wonderful album, and a great start of Linkin Park!
1400034779|5.0|I was so overwhelmingly charmed by this book and protagonist, I can't wait to break into the next in the series.<br /><br />Alexander McCall Smith has created a wonderful character: Direct, sympathetic, heartfelt, and worldly. The book breaks the mystery tradition of a detective solving one case over the course of a novel, and instead drops us into her daily routine, and the many varieties of cases she's called upon for. Funny, observant, and also quite touching, the book breaks the mold and create it's own category of mystery/fiction.
B000001DYA|5.0|I first bought this great album in 68 Since then I must have listened to it whether it was in vinyl,8 track,cassete,or CD format at least a 1000 times and never get tired of it .A definite must have! Blue Cheer Forever!!!

0156027321|1.0|This book had received so much hype that I could not wait to read it and once I started it I found it to be boring, boring, boring and was pleased once it finally ended.  The story line has so much potential, but the author fails to connect and make the book interesting and engaging.   <br /> <br />The book moves so slowly that it to me forever to get through it...I was quite frustrated in that I had wanted to love it after all the positive press I had heard about the Life of Pi, but I was greatly disappointed once I read it.  This book just does not live up to the hype!
B000002KJQ|4.0|It's sad that this album got lost behind ZZ Top's 1983 <br />mainstream hit album \\"Eliminator\\" because this is the <br />best overall album they did. In my opinion, LaGrange  <br />is the best song they ever did. But this album is deeper <br />as it has other well known tracks like \\"Beer Drinkers and <br />Hell Raisers\\" aswell as \\"Jesus Just Left Chicago\\" to round <br />out 3 big hits. However, the rest of this album holds it's <br />own.... \\"Waitin' for the Bus\\" a top notch ZZ Top song as <br />the hermonica is played at it's best here. Sheik is also <br />very underrated.
0385513755|5.0|I would suggest the illustrated version because it make it easy to follow the intrepretations of the paintings and architecture. It also enhances the imagery in the novel.<br /><br />The symbolism, characters and the plot make the novel so distinguished. More importantly, the subject matter will keep you involved and thinking.<br /><br />This is the kind of book that can spark your interest to read and research things you never thought about before.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|If one did not believe in Santa Claus, after watching this movie and realness of Acting and beauty of Scenery then he needs to have his or her head examined! We watched a few nites earlier the Cole Porter extravaganza \\"De'Lovely\\"! Then another effort to get into the \\"GARDEN STATE\\" of New Jersey with its drugs and Sex but not sexuality, for 8-9 minutes! Then we switched to the true Christas Spirit with Santa played by Ed Asner, the big ELF by Will Ferrell, his troubled Father by James Caan and human-lovely Mother by Mary Steenburgen.     After easing out of Santa's Bag back-home in ToyLand, the little guy not much bigger than our new Great-grandson, Roger Sidney IV was on the way to becoming a new Son of Good-Old Bob Newhart! Our 2003 ELF blossomed into Leader/Fixer of Santa's Snow Mobile and Chief Cheerleader with all of Santa's Elves!       Altho Christmas was already over, we swiftly moved to the Joyous Peace, Fun Excitement of Christmas, watching Will in an Elf/Suit nearly single handedly, save the Christmas Journey for Santa and his Raindeer into the City of the Big Apple. Great Fun for James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Ed Asner, the Real-life Santa!

B0006399FS|1.0|I know when U2 will release their \\"new\\" ( sorry but I can't name this album as a \\"new\\" one because it's evident were copied from all that you can't leave behind ) many fans will say \\"it's the best since achtung baby !!\\" or \\"it's the third masterpiece, buy it now\\", etc because it's hype time once again.     Where's the word NEW  in this album ?. This is not a dark album, this is just cheap commercial music for easy teens who listen to Britney Spears, Eminem, etc. Moreover, this album is far from \\"classic\\" U2. Word CLASSIC doesn't mean to copy themselves trying to sound like Joshua Tree or Unforgettable fire. That's what happen with this album, they just tried to sound like younger and better times, but they didn't make it. The album just sounds like a bunch of old men without new and fresh ideas to show us. I bet you by 2010 everyone will be listening to their real classics, I mean, Achtung Baby, Joshua Tree, UF, War, Zooropa, Boy, etc. But, like what's happening with All That You Can't Leave Behind, all fans easily will forget this failed bomb.    Sad but true. I've been a U2 fan since 1985, for 20 years. But I can't support this band anymore, specially with all that shameful marketing and Ipod stuff.    Have you been checking [...] recently ? ...    Please U2, stop stealing money.
B00005JN0T|3.0|This movie was both different and better than expected.  Will Smith does a good job as the detective, but the Robot steals the show.   <br /> <br />The story line was interesting.  Had the writers gone in a different direction, this could have been a great movie.  They chose to follow the simpler, entertaining path and made a really good action flick about robots going out of control.  The more difficult path would have been an exploration of the robot's evolution and how to define \\"life\\".   <br /> <br />Overall it's a good summertime action flick.  Worth buying and watching with the kidos.
0393324818|5.0|This is an enjoyable read, whether you are a baseball fan or not.  If you ever have to evaluate performance in any field, or if you are ever evaluated yourself (and this includes virtually all of us), then you should find this book fascinating.  Lewis gives us an inside look at the evaluation of baseball talent, and shows us the many ways that people are under or over valued.  Just imaging the difficulty of evaluating performance in fields where there are not dozens of objective statistics.  How far off are your supervisors evaluations of you, or your evaluations of your subordinates.  Raises interesting questions about defining the goals of an organization and analyzing the actions that further their achievement.
0452282152|5.0|I started reading this book and I could NOT put it down.  Tracy Chevalier has a way of writing the point of view of a young lady in this book that you'd actually think that it happened in real life. I like how it is written from the point of view of the young lady 'Griet'. I love the way its written.  Its easy to understand and the book just sinks you into it and you want to know more. I cant wait to buy and read her other books.  An A+++++ on my scale!  You must read this!
B00005JN4O|5.0|I went to the theatres with my friend to see Finding Neverland and expected a sappy drama. It turned out I was wrong. The movie was well played out, because of it's cast. The timeline (order of events and linkage of scenes) was perfect. Everything made sense and a few of the scenes were very dramatic. I would definately recommend this movie to anyone. This would be a great family movie to watch because there are no inappropriate love scenes (there was only one scene where there was a kiss on the cheek, but that's really mild.) No bad language that stood out (nothing vulgar is what I mean.) It's a great movie to show to kids because it shows what true family values are, and it shows that no matter what, you can never truely grow up...
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Great film but re the previous review : It is NOT the first full-length animated movie : <br /> <br />The 1st such film is generally thought to be Lotte Reiniger's \\"The Adventures Of Prince Achmed\\" ( 1926, Germany, available on DVD from Amazon ) - although possibly there are still earlier ( full-length ) contenders. <br /> <br />With reference to this; as usual it is generally the Europeans, not the Americans who created most of the greatest achievements in animation history; with some exceptions : eg Disney's \\"Snow White\\" & the sublime early work of the Fleischer brothers;  especially their magnificent Out Of The Inkwell / KoKo The Clown series ( which inspired Disney to do an awful animated  series in the mid-twenties called \\"Alice In Cartoonland\\" ): <br /> <br />Just as America often thinks its the centre of the universe in terms of world affairs & so on, so people often even have this view in relation to cultural matters also ; which in terms of the history of animation ( to anyone with any awareness of this ) - as is in so many other areas - is plainly not the case. <br /> <br />\\"Snow White\\" is of course a wonderful masterpiece for all the reasons so many people have given.
B00005ASHM|5.0|It's difficult at best to say that Pet Sounds outshines Sgt. Pepper and I suppose it depends quite a lot on which side of the musical fence you reside.

B00005JN0T|4.0|Having read Asimov, I rented this DVD with hesitation.  Expecting the worst, I was surprised.  No mental alarms or protests went off while watching the film.  It caught the spirit of the short story collection by the same name, while presenting a plausible future.  As this film presents a contrast between advancing technolgy and an eroding societal infrastructure.  It is the flip side of the coin to Blade Runner, more positive but still not the best of futures. <br /> <br />The added irony to the film is casting Will Smith as the detective: a black showing prejudice toward mechanisms, which are developing self awareness and filling a slave role.  Sadly Will Smith seems to have one character, as he plays the role as he did in Independence Day, Wild Wild West and other films; aggressive, sarcastic, a brother with an edge. <br /> <br />I plan to add this to my collection, and I plan to reread the original short story collection.
0140177396|5.0|Of mice and men is one book I have read and enjoyed.  If you are thinking of buying and reading a book this would be a great choice.  These are some suggestions why you should read Of mice and men.  I am a soohmore in High School and I believed that this book was going to be such a boring book.  But after a few days I began to enjoy it.  It was a book I can visualized in my mind. After the students read the book, it was the talk of the school.  <br /> <br />    Of mice and men is about two people named gearge and Lennie, Lennie was not such a bright men, he had the mind of a three year old. Lennie and George were on a aventure to fing a job because they were low on money(who isn't) when they find their job and they can hang on until they have enough money to buy a house. They didn't know the consequences, this might destroy their friendship, and even change dramatically the est of their lives.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000640VN|3.0|Meg Ryan is one of the problems with this movie. The other actors are much better. Meg is rude, her hair is an absolute  mess, and as others have stated why would anyone want to fall in love with someone so prickly. I found the other characters such to be more interesting. Kate is not a likeable character. Leo is sweet, funny, has great manners and is so likeable that it makes the film itself seem out of balance.
0060931671|4.0|The novel's protagonist, Oedipa Mass, starts out as a housewife in a \\"ticky-tacky\\" little suburb and gradually and seemingly randomly starts noticing things in her daily life that seem to be evidence of a secret society.  Its purpose is to conduct a secret alternative mail system.  She starts investigating this secret society and becomes engrossed in the belief that it actually exists, though in the end she's not sure whether it's for real or, as a few people she meets claim, an elaborate hoax.     As far as I can tell, The Crying of Lot 49 is basically an allegory about the nascent stages in the growth of various subcultures (the New Left, Reaganism, etc.) in Southern California during the early sixties (represented by the secret mail society) and mainstream America's slow realization of their existence and its subsequent fascination with them (represented by Oedipa).      Interestingly, this secret society seems to have adherents from both the cold warriors of the libertarian right and The New Left (or rather allegorical equivalents of these movements), suggesting some deeper similarity between these opposites - namely, their dissatisfaction with various (though mostly different) aspects of the anti-individualistic rigidity and staidness of middle-class post-war America.    Characters who submit to the shallow satisfactions of conventional society - such as Oedipa's husband, who becomes a sort of middle-aged teeny-bopper - come to look like freakish zombies.  Yet the alternative doesn't look so nice either.  Feeling pressed upon on all sides, the characters who don't submit want to escape into some sort of freedom but have little idea of what sort of freedom they want or what to do with it.      The only thing that unites all the people in this secret society is their unwillingness to participate in a generally accepted institution, the US mail system.  Yet they don't have much of a good reason for not participating considering that it's not as if the US mail system was corrupt or broken at the time.  In practice, this secret mail system is useless and absurd, so it's almost like they're not participating merely for the sake of not participating, as if they didn't know what to do with their willingness to drop out of conventional society.      What's interesting about Pynchon's book is that while we generally remember the more purposeful, driven radical elements of sixties culture (everything from the yippies to Goldwater), Pynchon reminds us how much of that dissatisfaction with Post-War America was just a vague, general ennui or anomie.  Of course, the book leaves open the possibility that the secret society doesn't exist at all, in which case it's all an illusion projected out of Oedipa's head, a fantasy generated by Oedipa's own wish for escape.      Considering how shallow and conformist America still is, it's easy to see the continuing relevance of this book even though so many things treated in the book have changed since then, such as the ascendancy of the radical right into the mainstream and the utter disappearance of the New Left.      Yet I have to admit that the book's critique of bureaucracy rings a little hollow these days, considering how many Americans there are now who wouldn't mind the staid yet secure postwar world so hated by these characters and probably Pynchon too.  As a temp worker who can't afford anything better than catastrophic health insurance, I know I wouldn't mind a bit more security, even at the cost of having to be a \\"company man\\" in a gray suit.      Regarding the notorious pranksterism of the plotting, the cartoonishness of the characterization, and the manic, elaborate parodies of all sorts of contemporary modes of rhetoric, I do have to admit that Pynchon overdoes it sometimes.  There are moments of hard-earned pathos if not sincerity, but as in the films of Godard, it's hard not to wish that they came little more often and with a few less caveats.  Still, fans of Nathanial West and Flannery O'Conner (or for that matter, Mystery Science Theater 3000, Harvey Birdman, and Radiohead) should feel right at home here in this cynical, scathing, absurdist brew.
6305949980|5.0|Perfect film to watch with family and friends for Halloween AND Christmas! Or in fact, any day of the year. Really, it's quite good (OK, it's REALLY great). Very dark in its design but it also contains a very uplifting tale and I think anyone of any age can enjoy (though perhaps not the wee ankle biters--the ghouls might scare them). <br /> <br />The stop-motion animation in NIGHTMARE is quite amazing and a treat for the eyes. Honestly, it's quite extraordinary what the animators and director did with both character design/movement and camera-panning. The songs by Danny Elfman are... wow. Singable, catchy, some a bit melancholy, others just pure fun. Never, ever boring. So what are you wasting your time for with reading this review? At least go out and rent this masterpiece. :)
B00005JNBQ|1.0|This is the worst movie i have ever seen. MY friend told me it was hilarious and it was so boring i couldn't watch it for more than a half hour, then i started to fall asleep. Most of my family left the room after the first half hour!!!!!!!!!!   Terrible. I absolutely hated this movie. Don't see this. Its a waste of money.The main character looked like he couldn't keep his eyes open, and he had no personality!! Not like a nerd. Just none at all.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I absolutely love this movie, no doubt about it. and the the update from Aileen Quinn, not approx. 30 years old was very interesting into the some of the props and even the fact that they're were two Sandys not just one.  The only thing I dislike is it's Full Format you you miss alot of the off-screen action.  The widescreen edition is older and is $40... not worth it for me now.  Hopefully in the future they will fix this problem and offer an affordable version in Widescreen.  Otherwise this is the best, watching it over and over again, you will notice alot of the background chatter is quite interesting and humuorous but you may have to put on subtitles to catch it all.

B0002X314C|4.0|John Legend's debut is all that it has been hyped up to be.  John Legend has the true soulful voice of which Kanye West has personally boasted about in reference to his protege.  It is nice to see a sort of retro-soul/neo-soul debut from an up and coming R&B male artist.  Compared to most R&B male artists, John Legend is in a whole different genre, with maybe the exception of the soulful Anthony Hamilton, who had an equally polished album with COMING FROM WHERE I'M FROM (which I also highly recommend).<br /><br />You can tell that John Legend definitely has church-influenced ideas within this album because it is so soulful compared to say an R.Kelly or Usher album.  One criticism might be for me that maybe it just gets a bit too soulful and takes away from the overall polished nature of the album.  Also at times, it seems like Legend's songs might just be missing something...but then if you think about classical soul artists, they didn't have all of they synthesizers, programming, and such in their songs. While I like all the songs, I have to say that I think that on \\"NUMBER ONE\\" feat. Kanye West, that Kanye West wasn't necessarily needed. A note to parents that \\"NUMBER ONE\\" specifically, does have a few sexual references as well as some language that might normally be censored or might not be considered healthy for children to hear.  There isn't a great deal on the rest of the album except for the \\"a\\" word or the \\"s\\" word and again only occasionally, but it would in most circumstances be censored or labeed with an Explicit sticker.<br /><br />A huge positive with this album is that it focuses on acoustic piano as opposed to all of the synthesizers that are gradually trying to take over contemporary R&B. Also the harmonized vocals just make this album twice as soulful and you feel like you are in the \\"church\\" of John Legend. The harmonized vocals are directly borrowed from the harmonies of an AME or Baptist Church Choir despite the fact that the album is definitely secular.<br /><br />My top picks from this album specifically are \\"LET'S GET LIFTED\\", \\"USED TO LOVE U\\", \\"SHE DON'T HAVE TO KNOW\\", \\"I CAN CHANGE\\" (feat. Snoop Dogg), \\"SO HIGH\\", and a very strong concluding track, \\"LIVE IT UP\\" feat. Miri Ben -Ari.  Excellent, Excellent, Excellent debut John!  4 1/2 stars!nitely secular.   <br /> <br />My top picks from this album specifically are \\"LET'S GET LIFTED\\", \\"USED TO LOVE U\\", \\"SHE DON'T HAVE TO KNOW\\", \\"I CAN CHANGE\\" (feat.

0425173895|5.0|Truely one of the most surprising endings of a mystery book.  Even if you're familliar with Christie's writing, this will very likely throw you off your feet. <br />The story itself is a pleasent one, written in Christie's usual light manner.  There are the colorful English characters, and all flows well enough, until the ending slaps you in the face like a full sized vegetable marrow.  If you've guessed the ending, my hat's off to you.  If not, don't feel bad, I've not met the person who has. <br />If you'd like, you can keep your eye out for the clues - they are there; very very subtle, but planted in the book.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|I do not know who at Dreamworks was responsible for this travesty of a DVD, but I would like to meet them so that I could tell them in person what a total hash they have made of the best anime (and one of the best films PERIOD) of the year. Never mind the imbecilic cover art (which in no way reflects the breath-taking art in the film) - WHAT is the rationale for HEARING IMPAIRED subtitles?? I always use subtitles - but as so many other people have written, I don't need to be informed of the sounds in the background. The theatrical release didn't have such intrusive subtitles - why are they here?!?! And let's face it - dubbing is not exactly a novelty on ANY foreign DVD: why not make it available here? I can only assume that, as usual, the corporate honchos at Dreamworks didn't actually SEE this, and handed it off to some hack who got their job because of knowing someBODY, not because they were competant. I will be waiting for Dreamworks (or maybe someone else with more intelligence) to re-release this. In the meantime - DON'T waste your money on THIS DVD - rent it if you want to see it, but DENY Dreamworks any more dough until they get their act together and put out a quality DVD that this film so richly deserves.
1572814349|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful and carefully prepared tarot decks I have ever seen: truly a work of impeccable art! From the moment one views this superb deck, the essence of bygone elegance and sophisticated packaging come to mind. Not only are the images from a bygone era, but the way the cards are presented speaks of the care and luxurious aesthetics of yesteryear.<br /><br />Created by Kat Black and published by the well-established company, U.S. Games, this deck offers timeless beauty and a sense of refined inquiry to your tarot reading sessions. Kat combines images from the Medieval, early Renaissance, and particularly the International Gothic period to provide well-known yet unique interpretations of the various cards' symbolic meanings. She particularly focuses on art from the periods 1300 to 1500 A.D. Kat deliberately chose to conform to the card styles introduced by the traditional Rider-Waite-Smith deck, but her own version offers a genteel, softer and much more personable version, in my humble opinion. The box that protects the cards is gorgeous - deep lapis blue and burgundy accented with gold embellish this sturdy, perfectly sized box: it looks like an elegant jewelry box. Inside, the cards are perfect for fitting in the hand, and feel wonderful as you hold them; the gold gilt edges give off a cool royal feeling as one listens to and touches the cards during shuffling, choosing and reading. A rare treat in this day and edge of plastic wrap and cheap paper. The publishers should be commended on their devotion to fine craftsmanship and customer experience.<br /><br />The Golden Tarot deck has the same basic structure as more traditional tarot decks - 78 cards in total with 22 key Major Arcana and 56 Minor Arcana cards, sorted into four suits (click on the link to view illustrations of all 78 cards). Kat presents the cards as the traditional suits coins, cups, swords and wands though she attributes interesting Medieval/Renaissance terminology to describe the meaning of each suit.<br /><br />The seamless collage approach used to create the lovely images of the Golden Tarot offers clear and familar imagery which helps the reader hone into the meaning of the cards. For instance, the Ace of Coins is represented by, \\"A beautiful red-haired angel holds a large coin. He stands in a rocky outcrop, but there is a lush garden in the background with a natural arch. The angel is flanked by a small lion, a peacock and a stem of lilies.\\" Kat chose to use angels for all of the four Ace cards, which adds an ethereal and blessed sort of energy to these prime cards of the minor arcana. (NOTE: Click on the card images to view an expanded interpretation and illustration of the cards on Kat's site).<br /><br /> The Royal Face cards are graced with regal wise looking monarchs and the face Trumps such as the High Priestess (who is represented by a woman who might be Pope Joan) display noble pictures of notaries and impressive players of the time. I particularly like the Queen of Wands, which also graces the front of the deck's display box. Kat describes this card's imagery: \\"A sensual red-haired Queen stands with her hands crossed elegantly on her breast. She holds a wand and wears rich red and gilt robes. A gold brooch emblazoned with a black rampant lion is pinned on her cloak. She is flanked by red angels glowing in the darkness.\\" All of the images smack of elegance and grace: Kat has truly done an amazing job of capturing the best of the Gothic/Medieval/early Rennaisance Period and made them meaningful for us in the 21st century.<br /><br />The deck comes complete with a palm-sized interpretation mini-book, that offers sensitive and intelligent meanings for each card as well as a detailed description of the original sources for the collage elements for each. For instance, her reading for the Queen of Wands states: \\"A strong, sensual woman. Knows what she wants, and isn't afraid to go for it - but she'd never step on anyone along the way. Passionate and creative. Down to earth, pragmatic and generous.\\" All in all, this is one of the finest decks available today. I highly recommend Kat's creation- the perfect gift for yourself or a loved one. It will appeal to the taste of people of all ages, and deserves a top spot in any tarot devotees' deck collection.nyone along the way. Passionate and creative.

B00065GWK6|5.0|I was not aware that all the people who enjoyed this film were teenagers on drugs. I guess that makes me one. When my friend made me see this movie, I had never heard of it, but once i'd scene it, I loved it. It was funny, strange, and has a large number of people who either love it, or hate it. I suppose it all depends on your sense of humor. <br /> <br />In a way, it's hard for me to understand why some people seem to dislike the characters so much. It kind of seems like your not even supposed to like them, and to me, that makes them loveable in their own weird way. Napoleon seems to have this idea that the popular kids are the ones who are losers, which in this case, they are. Sure he's kind of a jerk sometimes, but how do you expect someone to be that has never really had someone be nice to him.  <br /> <br />Another thing that I've heard people say about this film, is that Napoleon is an unbelievable character. Sadly, I have to disagree. I have know someone almost exactly like Napoleon, weird afro, and all. He was also a jerk and thought everyone else was kind of a loser. He was treated just like  Napoleon by his peers. To me, this movie was very truthful about people and even though it's presented in a strange, yet delightful way, it is a movie worth watching.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|Simply put: This movie was funny, but could have really been hilarious. <br /> <br />It is definitely NOT for everyone though. Especially those who have a hard time viewing anything that is not mainstream comedy (\\"Meet The Parents\\" variety of humor) and is most certainly not for those who are a bit ... sensitive to movies that may have a pinch of racial comedy. I have also found that this movie will generally disturb those who were part of the \\"In\\" crowd in High School or College because it pretty much puts a nail in their superficial coffin. It isn't as bad as people have been rating it, but it isn't a GOAT (greatest of all time) film either. But it is worth the 20 bucks.
B00005JMYI|3.0|I gave this movie an ok in the middle rating because it's so-so. There were a couple of laugh out moments. I do mean just a couple.  The anchorman rumble  with the other networks was funny) and \\"Afternoon Delight\\" was funny- But nothing to write home about-/ It's a could've been type of movie, lots of places where it could've been funny but just missed.
156898443X|5.0|I loved this book. I collect books on how to keep an art journal and this is the first one that unleashed my drawing and writing about everyday life. The other books are so polished and beautiful it made me feel like my drawings and writing weren't quite good enough. I love how he includes partial drawings because my sketchbook is full of partial drawings, they caught a glimpse of something so they are worthy of keeping. I also love how his writing can be a simple or funny thought that occurred to him during a drawing, rather than always something deep and profound. A beautiful book that will go on my very special favorites shelf to be read again and again.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Ok, the standards to enjoy this movie:<BR>1. Must be over 25 years old.<BR>2. Must not crave the hype of the stereotypical americanized 'funny' movie with Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, or Jim Carrey.<BR>3. Must know someone or been in Napoleon's shoes in the past.<BR>4. Must have grown up in or near a small town.<BR>If you meet these standars....THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE OF 2004!!!!! I LOVE YOU NAPOLEON
0425152251|4.0|It's amazing to me how very much my US public school education did NOT cover! SOPHIE'S WORLD is an excellent overview of Philosophy- and if you are anything like me, it's a relief to have a guide that puts everything in a (quirky) summarized timeline. <br /> <br />If one is a person that's not studied philosophy as a subject previously, it seems our knowledge of the subject and the philosophers is a confused smattering bits collected from various works we've read over the years.  This filled me in on pretty much all I missed in the broader sense- and now gives me direction on where I'd like to study next.  <br /> <br />I have mixed feelings about the whimsical blend of a fantasy story amid the chapters of history.  It did breathe life into the subject, forced me to take a break and contemplate what I've studied, and at times gave excellent examples for some of the concepts, but also was \\"in the way\\" at times when I just wanted to skip the whimsy and study the philosophies.   I'm delighted I came across the book and I'd certainly read the philosophical summaries again, but I doubt I'd read the fantasy story again.  <br /> <br />It's definitely worth reading if one has not studied philosophy previously, highly, highly recommended! <br />
0790731894|4.0|In \\"Executive Decision\\", Kurt Russell stars as a reluctant hero who is charged with saving the country from a airborne terrorist attack on the US that would have unbelievable consequences on the country.  Co-starring are Steven Seagal as Col. Austin Travis, the leader of a group of Army Rangers who provide Russell with the backup that he needs during the movie.  Halle Berry (before she really became HALLE BERRY) stars as the brave airline attendant, Jean, who provides the Rangers and Russell with help during their counterattack.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a terrorist group's reaction to the capture of their leader in the Mideast.  Their response to the arrest is to take over control of an American airliner and hold the passengers for ransom.  Or is that really their plan?  Rather than provide the viewer with too many plot details, let me suffice to say that a significant plot twist occurs during the first third of the film that changes the pacing and interest level of the film dramatically.<br /><br />Viewers who enjoy Kurt Russell's action movies and any of the \\"Die Hard\\"/\\"Lethal Weapon\\" genre' of films will certainly enjoy \\"Executive Decision\\".  The action is pretty much non-stop and will keep many viewers on the edge of their seats.
B000000OSG|3.0|I have the same problem with the \\"Illusion\\" albums as everyone else does.  They both have their moments, again, as everyone has stated a million times, there is enough good material here to put together one memorable album, but not nearly enough for two.  GnR was an excellent hard rocking band with a wide appeal, a band people somehow related to.  Looking back on those days, it seems like such a shame.  GnR were arguably the biggest band in the world when these albums were released, who knows how far they could have gone had the egomania inherent with such sudden, overwhelming success had been held in check?  These rambling, incoherent albums, chock full of filler material and heavily laden with plenty of whining about the difficulties involved in Being Axl, diffused the wave of excitement they initially generated.  They were largely met with mild enthusiasm, then bored yawns, which, listening to them now, they fully deserved.
B0006284JQ|1.0|This......is not music. How can this genius have a greatest hits album ALREADY????!! What, she's had 2 albums?? Britney Spears is a sick joke. She doesnt WRITE her own music, she doesnt PERFORM an instrument. This is a joke. It has to be. This is music for prepubescent 11 year olds who have not a clue as to what music actually is. Hopefully, they'll all grow up one day, realize the errors of their ways, and spend their hard earned (??) money on something worthwhile. Til then......
B000002MIY|5.0|Reportedly, Donald Fagen was stricken with writer's block in the `80s following the release of his debut solo album, 1982's \\"The Nightfly\\".  That would help to explain why he was as musically inactive as he was during the `80s.  The thing is though, it's hard to shake the feeling that it probably wasn't so much a case of writer's block as it was a case of Fagen holding himself to an extraordinarily high standard, & that he just felt that the music he was writing wasn't living up to the high expectations he was setting for himself.  Considering the level of commercial, as well as artistic success that Steely Dan & his debut solo album had had, he certainly could afford to take an extended break from recording.  Over 10 years after the release of \\"The Nightfly\\", Fagen finally released his second solo album, \\"Kamakiriad\\", in May of 1993.  Interestingly, \\"Kamakiriad\\" was produced by Fagen's Steely Dan partner Walter Becker, & Becker also co-wrote one of the songs & contributed guitar & bass work--that said, it really does make the album, to an extent, a bonafide Steely Dan reunion.  However, it was a smart and very respectable move from an artistic standpoint to credit it as a Donald Fagen album & not a Steely Dan one because the album is very much Fagen's baby--6 of the 8 tracks were written by Fagen alone, & he didn't disappoint.  I really can`t see how any Steely Dan fan would find this a disappointment.  Yes, there is indeed a certain `90s sheen to \\"Kamakiriad\\", but don't let that give you the wrong idea--the album is extremely tasteful & *sounds* great, with prominent organ, electric piano, & Walter Becker's luscious solo guitar tone.  \\"Trans-Island Skyway\\", \\"Countermoon\\", \\"Springtime\\", & \\"Tomorrow's Girls\\" are funked-up tracks that show Fagen's incredible knack for ultra-catchy hooks to be as strong as ever.  The Becker/ Fagen composition \\"Snowbound\\" has a great, soothing, richly harmonized chorus, and although it's let down a bit by the verses, it's still a damngood track overall.  \\"Florida Room\\" is somewhat overcooked, but it's still fun & catchy.  The lush ballad \\"On the Dunes\\" has an extended instrumental coda that runs on a minute or so too long, but apart from that, it's a great track.  In the end, you really can't go wrong with \\"Kamakiriad\\"--it's great to see Fagen staying true to himself and in such strong form.  If you truly love the Dan, you won't regret picking this up, and with so many cheap copies floating around, why not?  If you see this in solid condition on CD for $3, this is a steal.

B0002XNSY0|4.0|Talk about nuclear proliferation -- \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" is back on DVD, making its fifth appearance in that video format's relatively short life. This \\"40th Anniversary Special Edition\\" of Stanley Kubrick's blackest of black comedies targets households bunkered for the widescreen age. The primary upgrades are the high-definition transfer (its first) and -- more dramatically -- a re-engineering into 1.66:1 anamorphic widescreen.<br /><br />Aspect ratios usually don't draw attention, but \\"Strangelove\\" is a special and controversial case. The previous Columbia DVD, released in 2001 (included in Warner Bros.' \\"Stanley Kubrick Collection\\"), followed specs issued by the director. Kubrick's home-vid vision -- presumably influenced by VHS and the square TVs that still dominated in the 1990s -- was mostly full screen (1.33:1) with some slight ratio adjustments. Criterion's marvelous laserdisc of 1992 shifted between 1.66 and 1.33, again per Kubrick.<br /><br />Columbia's latest thinking was to redeploy \\"Strangelove\\" in its \\"correct\\" original British theatrical widescreen ratio of 1.66, providing consistent dimensions scene-to-scene as in 1964. A direct comparison of the 2001 DVD and the new disc reveals a lot of lost visual information, some significant. The effect on compositions inside on Ken Adam's famed War Room set ranges from meaningless to dramatic when A-B'd. The transfer holds other surprises. The new version is markedly darker at the expense of imagery previously much more brightly cast. The older versions tended toward coarse, blown-out contrasts, however, and many viewers will appreciate the new more elegant and sinister look. Sony's restorers were able to exterminate a lot of the debris evident on the older DVD, even though they used materials several generations away from the mother negative (the original is long gone).<br /><br />Audio options are Dolby Digital, DTS and mono, all solid choices, but don't expect much from the 40-year-old sound. (Kubrick wanted you to hear it in mono.) The 5.1 formats add some rear-channel rattle and hum from the bombers and some echoes, but the sound mostly holds its center-channel position. All that great dialogue from Kubrick and Terry Southern is crystal clear, an upgrade from the 2001 version, which sounds a bit hollow.ted you to hear it in mono.)

B0000508U6|4.0|I just read the hateful \\"review\\" by 'A music fan'.  I'm surprised that people with nothing but hate are allowed to review at Amazon.  Parachutes is a sublime record, and that is coming from someone who loves Metallica, Fear Factory, Killswitch Engage, SYL, Emperor, and many more metal bands.  I also love great music from other genres.  Stop the Brit bashing from fools like 'A music fan', and enjoy this for the great rock record it is.
B000002BE9|4.0|The first thing you notice about an Apple album, is how low everything is.  Not only does the 'little girl' growl and bellow well below middle-C, but the fast-moving, intricately-intervaled piano accompaniment is solidly written in the bass clef.  The result is a rich, soupy sound that is entirely origininal and new if subtly influenced by the nearly monotone work of folk singer Suzanne Vega. <br /> <br />The clearly literary lyrics go for the jugular from the first - <br /> <br />\\"I tell you how I feel, but you don't care. <br />I say 'tell me the truth,' but you don't dare. <br />You say love is a hell you cannot bear, <br />And I say give me mine back and then go there for all I care.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />From there the opening track \\"Sleep to Dream\\" rolls into a forceful assault that rises from the bottom of the soul, screaming out to the audience at the bridge: <br /> <br />\\"Don't even show me your face, 'cuz its a cryin' shame <br />Just go back to the rock from under which you came\\". <br /> <br />From there the album slows to a more introspective tone, which eventually dominates the album.  Songs like \\"Sullen Girl,\\" and \\"The Child is Gone\\" Are best understood in the context that they are written: at an early age, Apple was raped and much of Tidal is work about her survival. <br /> <br />\\"They don't know how I used to sail the deep and tranquil seas <br />All day and all night <br />He washed me ashore and he took my pearl <br />And left an empty shell of me.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Shadowboxer\\" picks up where \\"Sleep to Dream\\" leaves off.  It might be my personal favorite track, because it's emotional intensity abosultely burns.  Though the song starts off even tempoed and under control by the bridge, its built up serious steam: <br /> <br />\\"So I'll be sure to stay wary of you love <br />To save the pain Of once my flame and twice my burn\\" <br /> <br /> <br />The tune is catchy, in the odd way that alternative piano based rock can be, but is ultimately quite satisfying. <br /> <br />The awaited moment.  \\"Criminal.\\"  \\"Criminal\\" is Apple's best known song, in part because of the unsettling video that hit the MTV airwaves.  Momentarily putting aside the Abercrombie and Fitch kiddie porn, and looking soley at the song - \\"Criminal\\" is a masterpiece.  Lyrically, \\"Criminal\\" seems to tell the tale of a young woman suffering from the borderline personality disorder, but that's probably a little deep.  I'm sure the intended meaning of the lyrics is a little more mundane: it's the story of a girl who cheated, and boy - she must have cheated bad. <br /> <br />\\" I've got to make a play <br />To make my lover stay <br />So what would an angel say <br />The devil wants to know <br />And I need to be redeemed to the one I sinned against <br />Because he's all I ever knew of love.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />Technically, the most interesting aspect of the tune is the use of double-tracking on the second chorus.  It's a technique that since the digital revolution is being much abused, but coming into the chorus \\"what I need is a good defense\\" the vocal tracks don't quite match up.  It's the auditory effect of a serrated knife that might remind one of the chorus to Cocaine, the vocals glow like a neon light. <br />\\"Criminal\\" is not sparse music, but the arrangement is never overbearing.  It stays true to the original piano writing but the addition of flutes on the verses and thick string sounds in the chorus and bridge make the song even more intense, and increase it's natural drive.  \\"Criminal\\" would run away with a lesser vocalist, but Apple's aching melody line remains strong until the last. <br /> <br />Perhaps though, the placement of \\"Criminal\\" on the album is unfortunate.  It seems that the rest of the album is entirely downhill. Though momentous and more musically meaningful than anything release by female pop artists in the last five years, tracks five through ten seem to pale in comparison to the first four. \\"Pale September\\", \\"First Taste\\", \\"The Child is Gone\\", \\"Slow Like Honey\\" and \\"Carrion\\" are all strikingly similar.  They run into each other very fluidly and can be indistinguishable from each other.  By the end of the album, Apple is singing so far in the back of her throat that her words are almost unintelligable.  Though \\"Never is a Promise\\" is certainly a deep-track gem, being buried in such mire makes it difficult to appriciate.  When \\"Carrion\\" is over, you'll want to press play again, just to make sure that you leave your stereo and this CD with a good taste in your mouth. <br /> <br />I give this album a four.  Four what you say? <br /> <br />Four tickets to Lilith Fair.

Deep) <br />Square dance - 3/10 (I hate this song. the beat isn't good at all and the lyrics aren't focused) <br />the Kiss (Skit) <br />Soldier - 10/10 (Amazing song with fast beat and hard lyrics) <br />Say goodbye To Hollywood - 9/10 (Very good song with simple beat and brilliant lyrics) <br />Drips - 9/10 (Quite funny in places where its telling you the dangers of unprotected sex) <br />Without Me - 10/10 (Classic eminem song where he just goes all out. fast beat with good bassline and lyrics) <br />Paul Rosenberg (Skit) <br />Sing For the Moment - 10/10 (good rock beat and pure quality lyrics) <br />Superman - 10/10 (brilliant beat with equal lyrics) <br />Hailie's Song - 9/10 (Nice slow song where Eminem is singing for his Daughter) <br />Steve Berman (Skit) <br />When the Music Stops - 10/10 (Beat is brilliant and the lyrics are really witty from all of D-12) <br />Say What You Say - 10/10 (Hard beat from Dr. Dre with verses from Em and Dre) <br />'Till I Collapse - 7/10 (sloppy beat with OK lyrics - not a standout) <br />My Dad's Gone Crazy - 10/10 (Cool song with very good beat and amazing lyrics especially on verse 3) <br />Curtains Close (Skit) <br /> <br />Overall this is an amazing album for the beats AND the lyrics. Well worth buying... <br /> <br />
B0002NRRAG|4.0|I give this album 8 out of 10
B00006RINF|5.0|I love this album, because it just has that sound, that you just can't get enough of. This band has more of an edge over Evanescence, because the music has a lot more power and sound. The vocals for the Cristina Scabbia are done a lot better, then they were for their previous album Unleashed Memories, nothing really wrong with the vocals on Unleashed Memories, but you can understand her a little better on this one. Some of the singing still sounds sketchy but that is not surprising, they are from another country, they are just trying their best, and that's all that matters. All the songs are great, Self Deception is fine but doesn't really have the effect that the other songs on the album have. Angel's Punishment introduces Cristina's speaking voice on the album, and she does a fantastic job, the difference between her speaking voice and singing voice is amazing. Of course the band has to give a song that is in Italian Language, which is the final song, Comalies, mixed Italian and English words, it is a fine song, and even if you don't understand what they are saying, you will like it. Rock fans will respect the effort on the 9th track Unspoken, which is well recorded, and wonderfully played. In my view this is a great album, and is superior to Evanescence's Fallen album, and i mean that, and i like that album aswell.
B000002NBY|5.0|Well this was a sort of transitional period in Paul Simon's music. As \\"Hearts and Bones\\" was his foray into 80's new wave, this album shows him straying from the 80's sound and going into world music (with a little Zydeco thrown in). The 80's sound is still present (You Can Call Me Al, as well as recurring synth drums) but it will be completely gone by the time he records Rhythm of the Saints.  <br /> <br />So what makes this album so much more celebrated then his other 80's albums? Well, the songs are flawless. \\"Crazy Love, Vol. II\\" is probably the worst song on the album IMO, but it's still great. It's a fairly personal album as well, expanding on his divorce with the song \\"Graceland\\". Add in some humorous songs and life-affirming pop and you have possibly the best album in the 80's.
B0000028RR|5.0|The best rock/rap mix to ever grace the musical landscape RATM flat out knock your socks off with this CD. The mix of intelligent socially aware lyrics, Zack's fiery delivery, and the awesome hard knock sound make Rage the band of the 90s and their self entitled debut an instant classic and must have for all rock fans. The great thing about them is that you don't have to agree with their views or even know what Zack is talking about. The meaning and historical references in the songs are simply there if you choose to enjoy them. The music isn't a slave to the message it just adds the message for those who want to catch it. <br /> <br />
B0000UJDLM|5.0|I bestow this epic Johnny-5 out of 5 stars.  <br /> <br />Not since \\"Police Academy 4 - Citizens on Patrol\\" has Steve Guttenberg given us such a stunning performance. Mr. Guttenberg doesn't tell the story he lets the story tell itself. The cast of supporting actors shine as well. Keeping up nicely with the high mark Mr. Guttenberg has set. It's a shame that they weren't the recipients of the 1986 Academy Award. Johnny 5 the most lovable of the bunch looks similar to what you would have if you were to take a box cutter and slowly skin away the latex covering on E.T. to reveal just the animatronic puppet beneath. Even with the aforementioned statement Johnny still makes for a very deep and inspirational character. In fact he inspired me to pursue my love for Jamie Lyons, and just for the record ,Jamie, it doesn't say anywhere in the restraining order that I can't mention you in a online movie review of Short Circuit on Amazon.com so just lay off b1tch, God I love you!!  <br /> <br />The story starts with Johnny 5 as a killing machine made for Military uses. After getting struck by lightning in a demo for the Military Johnny receives feelings and the ability to tell bad jokes. Funny because a friend of mine Keith Ko, was struck by lightning and all he received was 10 minutes of unconsciousness and a soiled pair of tighty whiteies to boot. After Johnny gets his new found talents he takes us all on a journey that we will not soon forget. It's up to you if you will take this journey with him. Buy this DVD and for the next 2 hours you can leave all yours woes, transgressions and that DUI behind you and just enjoy the trip. <br />
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is a movie for the ages. Really one for the ages. I rented this movie upon the advice of a Broadway producer friend and was just overcome. I usually just hate Hollywood doing Broadway (like Chicago, barf) but Hollywood doing MTV works. And Ewan is a hotie. See this movie at once. See it today. See it!
B00009V7T2|4.0|If you only listen to the vast musical wasteland known as mainstream radio, you might think there are no innovative rock bands out there nowadays.  Well, you'd be wrong, because Mars Volta (formed, as everyone and their brother knows by now, out of the ashes of At The Drive-In), have given us one of the most unique and interesting albums of the past 5 years in the form of De-Loused in the Comatorium.  This album, pardon the cliche, is one wild ride, filled with intrepid free-form experimentation and startling musicianship.<br /><br />The Mars Volta take the punkish aggression and Tejano flavor that so often characterized ATDI and reinterpret it through the unpredictable, anti-song structures of progressive rock.  While the Rush comparisons (both positive and negative) on this site are somewhat apt, Rush never sounded this tight or hit this hard.<br /><br />At its best, this album is a whirling vortex of sound, driven forward by Omar Rodriguez Lopez's whiplash-inducing arpeggiated guitar riffs and the spastic drumming of Jon Theodore.  At other points, the band delves into a spacy latin/jazz/rock hybrid, perhaps best exemplified by Omar's piercing, Santana-for-the-21st-century guitar solos on Drunkship of Lanterns and Cicatriz ESP.  Better yet, even in its lighter moments, such as the near-ballad Televators, the album maintains a certain emotional intensity that shows through even more without the musical acrobatics that are so often present.<br /><br />Wide-ranging as this album is, vocalist Cedric Bixler handles his demanding task brilliantly, thanks to an elastic voice that hits hard even when he's reaching into the higher registers.  So basically, if you're intrigued by the idea of metallic, punkish, progressive, latin-flavored rock music and you haven't heard this album yet, you should check it out.  And that's that.
B00008S2VG|2.0|This album stinks to high heaven. What a no-talent wannabe Madonna is. This is a dreadful attempt for Manny keep up with her much younger contempories. But...the results are laughable. A rapping Mandonna...now, that is amusing.
B0002BO0AS|3.0|Unearth are a tough band to figure out.  On one hand, they're vastly superior to the legions of contrived nu-metal and \\"tough guy\\" hardcore bands out there.  On the other, they still haven't reached the heights routinely achieved by such bands as Meshuggah, Converge, and the Dillinger Escape Plan.  That's too bad, as all the ingredients for a great band are here.  These guys are all skilled musicians, they clearly put loads of emotion into what they do, and their songs are typically catchy in addition to being fiercely heavy.<br /><br />So, you might be asking by now, what's wrong with that?  Well, nothing's really wrong with Unearth Per se, but they don't really do much to stand out either.  While the above-mentioned greats are all committed to experimenting with their sounds and pushing the boundaries of heavy music, Unearth seem largely content occupying their own safe metalcore niche.<br /><br />On the whole, while delivered more than competently, Unearth's sound is distinctly average, and not especially varied.  I want to like these guys a lot more, but after hearing their last two albums I'm not convinced.  Call it Killswitch Engage syndrome.
B0000029DD|5.0|this song was played on a West Wing tv episode - and stayed with me Ever After... and it's wonderful to find it - to stand with Dust In The Wind by Kansas AND Sarah Brightman AND GunsNRoses... this song is to me what Amazing Grace means to most people...
0380977788|5.0|\\"Coraline\\" isn't a book for the youngest of children. Not only is it lengthy, but the content might be over their heads, and the ideas might be too frightening. However, for the growing reader, children in upper elementary school, and even for juveniles and adults, this book is excellent.<br /><br />Coraline is a somewhat neglected little girl whose parents both work at home. She spends her days exploring the flats where she lives and the area surrounding them. On a rainy day when she cannot go outside, she explores inside the house, and opens a door that's supposed to open to a brick wall... but instead opens to a dark corridor. On the other side, she finds a world similar to her home, but somewhat off. Most different are her parents. They actually pay attention to her. But they want more. They want her to stay and be their little girl; they want to change her, and not let her go.<br /><br />Coraline is the best kind of children's book, not because of its subject matter, but because it doesn't talk down to children. As an adult reading this, while I felt some of Gaiman's prose was simplified, the content and narrative were not. It was written as a book for children to grow into, not to just have and forget.<br /><br />It isn't boring for adults for that matter; it only makes one regret not having it as a kid. There's some very clever dialogue in here, and a lot of interesting thoughts about Coraline's situation. Also interesting, questions are brought up concerning Coraline's other mother and what this alternate world is, yet they're never answered, with only hints given that what's happening is bigger than what Coraline has guessed. I believe a young reader who is reading this now will appreciate it all the more when they go back to it after growing up. For anyone who has already grown up, you have a book you should read.
B00000D9TQ|1.0|The introverted piano sonatas of Beethoven, the raining atmosphere of Coltrane, the cultural impact of the Beatles. But no... alas, millions of people are tasteless and dead enough on the inside to find this music \\"good\\". However, Phil colins, for all his shortcomings, does possess an amazing rampart with the mentally retarded. It's beautiful that he can be the voice of millions of stupidity imbued people around the world. If only other recording artists of the 80's would find a cause to redeem there banal soul's before inevitably puting a 12 gauge shotgun in their mouth and splewing their meager brains out the back of their' thoughtless little heads. Phil Colins makes Britney Spears look like Nietzsche, and if you don't know who Nietzsche is, then his music has apparently already took hold and there's no hope for your soul.
0375701427|1.0|While the novel is extremely well written, it drones on and on and in the end is very disappointing.  We have to sift through many ideas and counter ideas but never learn what happens!  Who was Rita Cohen?  He goes on and on about her- yet we stay mistified.  What happens to Merry?  Does she die of starvation?  Does she go to jail?  We don't know.  What about his life after Dawn?  The plot is very thin and the commentary about american life is very thick.  I didn't disagree with any of his ideas but instead thought, \\"so what\\"?  In this story it seemed that the problems of the United States caused the problems of the hero. Not believable.  Here is what we come away with:  Mr. Roth is very bitter about the United States.  Voila. Dull!
0140386335|5.0|A student of mine gave me this for Christmas, as I'd never read it, and I totally enjoyed it.  I read it all in one day while waiting in airports and flying across country, and it was compelling all the way through--a very wide-ranging and imaginative epic adventure.  It's really a meta-novel:  a children's book about a book within a book, one where the lines between \\"reality\\" and \\"fantasy\\" get completely blurred as the protagonist, a boy named Bastian, discovers that he has become a character in the book he's reading.  The story has a realm of mythical creatures from centaurs and giants to tinies and luckdragons, all of whom coexist in the realm of Fantastica.  Although in translation (by Ralph Manheim), the descriptions are beautiful, and the adventure is compelling throughout.  The first half portrays a hero, Atreyu (a ten-year old boy), trying to find the solution to the illness of the Childlike Empress (a title that I found mysteriously evocative throughout) which is corresponding to the growing destruction of Fantastica--evils that are apparently external to the characters themselves.  But the second half, which is still as adventurous, takes us into the consequences of the flaws and poor choices of Bastian himself, a ten-year old boy with both selfless and selfish impulses.  Atreyu's quest is thus to save his home and the Childlike Empress from destruction, while Bastian's quest is one more of loss, choices, and self-discovery.  Each step in Bastian's path, whether progressive or regressive, has tremendous effects on Fantastica, and, paradoxically, he has to forget as much as he learns in order to find himself.<br /><br />Each of the 26 chapters begins with the letters of the alphabet in order, and the illustrations for the first page of each chapter are wonderful.  The paperback version alternates between the \\"real world\\" and Fantastica with the use of different typefaces; I hope some day to get a hardbound edition that uses two colors just like the book that Bastian is reading.hat Bastian is reading.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|My first introduction to the Beatles was over 2 years ago. I picked up the Abbey Road album, listened to a few songs and thought it was junk. \\"So much for the Beatles I thought\\". I was really into heavy metal then. It wasn't until a few months ago that I ran into a former classmate of mines who was overly obsessed with them, which sparked my interest again. To make a long story short, I picked up this album and gave it a listen - and let me tell you this album ROCKS big time. <br /> <br />Listening to the album with fresh ears, made me realize how great this album is. It also includes classic songs that I always loved to hear on the radio but never knew belonged to them. Songs such as, \\"hello,goodbye\\", \\"hey jude\\", and \\"let it be\\" are all classics I love.  <br /> <br />Some say this album is inferior to the White Album and in some ways that is true. Most of this album consists mainly of love songs, whereas the white album contains a lot of funky and experimental stuff. But make no mistake this is a GREAT album and if you want a great introduction to the Beatles and the best bang for your buck, don't skip out on this one.
0375805613|5.0|I owned this book as a child and I still remember and cherish it. Although my daughter is only 1 month old. I am looking forward to reading it to her to the point where she will \\"read\\" (really memorizing the story) it to me, like I did with my mother.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|this movie was wicked funny.  there really is no point to it but its just funny.  some if my favorite things he sais is, \\"idiot\\" \\"what do you think?\\", \\"sweet\\", \\"fine\\", and \\"maybe i will, gosh!\\"  and hilary duff's sister is in it. wierd... o well.  DYNOMITE!!!!
B000001EAQ|3.0|I love everything by U2 up untill POP. POP isn't a bad album, and I don't think it's a \\"light\\" album either. It's probably the most depressing U2 album I've ever heard. But there's a certain dynamic that I feel like is lacking here, that was strongly present in some way shape or form on all the other albums. This album is short on a grand vision and that unique, idealistic, self-assured, sweeping, spirited core that carried all the other U2 albums.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|What started out as a Sundance film eventually turned out to be the \\"talk\\" of my high school. I am not much of the going-outter since I have a strict mom, but nevertheless after months of seeing Vote for Pedro tshirts and endless quoting from my peers, I bought the movie on DVD and it surprised me. This movie is really a breather from the endless list of teenage high school movies about boy/girl lusting after girl/boy and what they would do to get there. Not to mention all the drug/alcohol/etc references made in between. This is not a love story, though there are romantic tie-ins, but simply, the dork of the school having to deal with a unusual family, mean bullies, and helping Pedro win the school election against popular Summer Wheatly. He is truly the kind of character that is unforgettable. Some people might not like it as much as others. Depends on your sense of humor. But it has some slapstickish funny moments if you can only laugh at those.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|An extremely clever and witty spoof of Dawn of the Dead, this film deftly mixes comedy, romance, and zombie movie staples into a perfect package. It is, without doubt, not only one of the funniest movies to come out of Great Britain in 2004, but it is also one of the better horror films.  <br /> <br />\\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is a must-see for fans of well-done comedies and zombie movies alike; its got all the zombie movie staples and it treats them with respect and seriousness even while surrounding them with absurd and hilarious situations. Basically, \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is what the many sequels to \\"Return of the Living Dead\\" wished they could be.
B000002I25|5.0|Henry McPruter.......hehaheha. Is this guy for real or what? He goes around saying great bands like The Doors, Pink Floyd, Led-Zeppelin, Metallica, Guns N' Roses, and Van Halen are crap.Ohh and get this he thinks New Kids On The Block, and NSYNC are awsome. This guy or should I say girl must be kidding. I'm not sticking up for these bands just because they are some of my favorites. The album sales prove that they are some of the best ever.There must be some reason why these bands are sucessfull and it is their talent.Their legendary.Number one NSYNC doesn't play one instrument. And Number two their not even around anymore!!!! Is this guy out of his mind? NSYNC is the one that sucks.They couldn't even keep their band together for 5 years.As for New Kids On The Block they only lasted for about a couple of years.I never seen a man that listens to pop music. He has got to be a homo.Get a life Henry. Quit makeing fun of the legends.
0780631684|3.0|I'm a lover of horror films, and I really wanted to like this one. The premise of this film seemed interesting to me, but its execution is severely lacking. It never manages to convey a sense of urgency, or even the inevitability of the deaths closing in on the characters. Part of the cause for this is that the mysterious fates that are stalking the characters do so in a rediculous fashion... and then they bother to hide the \\"accidents\\" as suicides.  <br />
B00018D44U|5.0|For this album, i really liked the songs, and their country-jazz verges. It's not my favorite, but for something outside my spectrum it was really good. To say as some did that she is not talented is quite an absurd falsity... on the contrary i find especially in her remake of the classic Duke song that she holds so much potential... Reviewers like Hans have no right to say that she could ever be compared to a different era.. Let's think about it logically Sarah Vaughn vs. Norah Jones, need I say more, they're both good in different ways, but to compare Norah to even Coltrane would seem asinine, and yet it's been done... Also to say you'd rather listen to pigs being slaughtered than listen to this CD, and that we should avoid it if we can, is wrong. For one have you even heard the sound of pigs being slaughtered? and two, you have every right to state how you feel, but don't tell others not to buy the CD. All of these comments bothered me extremely of people who find the music uninteresting, and plain, obviously you'd rather dismiss something without even intellectually approaching it... <br />
B0006213WG|5.0|Before buying the cd, I had heard of the band Sum 41 a couple times but never bought their cds. While watching MTV one night, I saw the making of the video We're All To Blame. From the second I heard the song I was dying to get the cd just for the song. Once I scaned through all the songs I was amazed what brilliant band I had been missing out on. I don't know and can't tell you if this is there best cd but compared to other cds, this one is a GREAT one and everyone should add to their collection!

B000002UB3|4.0|On Abbey Road that is. I can never figure out what is the best Beatles album, but it is between this and Sgt. Pepper's for sure. Overall the Songs are better on Pepper's, but this one has a few of the real Gems that weren't hits (I want You, she's so heavy, and  She came in through the bathroom window) I think The Beatles themselves Knew this would have been the best they could do cause it was their last. Plus in the 35 years since none of thier solo stuff even came close. Now there is still some boring tracks on here, filler if you will, as there is on all Beatles CD's and it is probably not the masterpiece that the Bands 60 year old followers will tell you, but it is timeless
1558908323|5.0|Seven years before Guillermo Del Toro gave us \\"Hellboy\\" he gained himself a beachhead on the American horror movie front with \\"Mimic\\", 105 minutes of chilly, goopy, genuinely creepy high-tension nastiness that does what most New York apartment dwellers don't wanna do: checks behind the fridge.<br /><br />Ever heard that expression, \\"for every one you see there's 100 more\\"? If you've lived in New York City you have: whether you live in a luxury high-rise with a doorman or a Bowery flophouse with communal toilets, you're going to deal with roaches. The city is infested.

Problem solved, New York's children saved.<br /><br />Or are they? Cut to three years later: New Yorkers are disappearing in droves, and mysterious, shrouded figures are lurking around the subways and back alleys. Oh, and they like to make funny noises as they stalk their victims, noises like \\"click-clock-click\\".

B0001ZMWQO|2.0|I'm not sure why this contrived, by-the-numbers, overhyped \\"alternative\\" CD resonated with so many people in 2004. I was even predisposed to like Franz Ferdinand because of all of the critical rave-ups of this young Scottish band.  Upon repeated listenings, I found little more than a generic rock band using the marketing template of alternative rock. If this is \\"alternative\\", I'll take whatever alternative there is to \\"alternative\\".<br /><br />What is so astounding about this CD is all those critics who about Franz Ferdinand, do little more than compare them to other more inspired alternative bands. Tell me what I'm supposed to like about this band, other than they sound like (pick one:)1.Blondie, 2. The Strokes, 3. Interpol, 4. Radiohead (!) or any number of other bands.  Franz Ferdinand's problem is they have none of the imagination or lyrical sensibility smart pop bands the bands they've been compared to. I've heard the Shins and Franz Ferdinand ain't the Shins, folks. If you can't tell the difference then you need a new set of ears.<br /><br />Franz Ferndinand's problem is a symptom of the larger problem with the entire genre of \\"alternative rock\\" ... Alternative rock is nothing more than the product marketing focus groups. Music for the psuedo-cool who think \\"hipness\\" is just another product to be purchased in the marketplace. Alternative has become ambient music for shopping at the Gap. Much of it sounds bloodless as the rest of the bland warmed-over gruel that the five major record labels serve the consumer.<br /><br />One reviewer praised Franz Ferdinand as being \\"21st Century Duran Duran\\"... Since when is being like Duran Duran a good thing??? Where I grew up, Duran Duran was a posuer \\"haircut band\\" for MTV teenyboppers.

But this incredible box set I was expecting quite a bit, especially for 10 DVD's with 35 hours of added featurettes, cartoons, extras etc... Although being a fan I'm pleased with what this box set offered, they once again left the \\"superior original\\" Matrix with the skimpiest additions.  The movie itself got a \\"supposed\\" new digital transfer, and I have to say, while it looks astonishing, I have to say I really don't see a visual difference compared to the original DVD that was released. It has 2 new commentaries and a 17 Featurette which focuses on the movie from conception from completion. It's nice to have this, but compared to Reloaded and Revolutions which are medicore movies at best (we'll get to that later) the original Matrix deserved so much more because it's the best of the bunch, so why give it the least attention? Fans who know, will agree, but if you can forgive that, you still might want to pick up this jammed box set and Matrix fans probably had this on opening day.      The Movies:    The Matrix: The best of the trilogy by far and back in 1999 it was still before its time, anyone who says otherwise -- shame on you. The story gripped me from start to finish and it's the ultimate mind boggle movie. \\"As Morpheus says, if you want to know what the Matrix is, you have to see it for yourself\\", so watch the movie. And although there were some answers and conclusions for everytyhing in Revolutions, the original Matrix could have been a perfect stand alone movie. I think that's one of the simple reasons why Reloaded and Revolutions did not turn out as one may have liked because all the good ideas, great storyline \\"and good characters\\"  were basically used up in the original. I don't think the Wachowski Bros (the directors) were really planning on a sequel, at least not until they noticed a massive success, and that it what happened, the Matrix broke some majorrecords for both movie and DVD sales. For me, the story of the \\"Matrix\\" was concluded for me at the end of the Matrix. Sure the movie left you hanging a bit, but Reloaded and Revolutions seemed to leave a nasty taste on my tongue and I wanted Reloaded and Revolutions to go back to the drawing board, But this is what we got, so we need to deal and make the most of it. I think the characters in Matrix are also much more appealing. How could I forget the evil seed Joe Pantoliano (Sopranos) who was sorely missed in Reloaded and Revolutions. And \\"Gloria Foster\\" still makes for the best Oracle, thank goodness she is in Reloaded for one last stand.    The Matrix Reloaded: A convoluted storyline with the best fighting scenes I've ever experienced. Not as bad as Revolutions and not near the experience of the original Matrix, Reloaded is the \\"Return of the Jedi\\" of the Matrix focusing on some major action and that alone saves the movie and action buffs will not be disappointed. \\"The Burly Fight\\" scene where NEO takes on a hundreds of Smiths (Agents) is the most astonishing fighting sequence I've ever seen. If you have a workout machine in front of your TV, turn this fight scene on to get pumped. It's 10 minutes of the ultimate craziness which won't be surpassed for some time. I was saddened to find out the character who played the \\"Oracle\\" (Gloria Foster) died shortly after shooting Reloaded which explains why she did not return for \\"Revolutions\\".  Her replacement character, while acceptable, can't seem to match her genuine tenderness and realism that she gave NEO in both movie. I will miss her.     The Matrix Revolutions: Blah blah blah blah. You know what, I read so much about this movie before it hit theaters and actually heard how bad it was, I didn't even give it a chance when it was in the theaters, so I decided to watch it when it came to DVD. When it finally did, it certainly had a conclusion (a sad one) to a point, but it's not quite as bad as I thought it was goingto be and once again, focuses on action rather than character developent or plot. Revolutions, clearly the worst of the trilogy, manages to get the job done and does conclude the story and puts an end to the questions, but when you compare it to the original, there is no comparison.     This box set is what it says, \\"the ultimate Matrix\\" collection ---Fans won't be disappointed with the countless featurettes, extras, trailers, tv spots, character interviews, tons of commentaries, 9 AniMatrix Cartoons, all jammed packed into 7 DVD's along with the 3 DVD movie discs. It was nice to see the movie trailers and tv spots finally for the three movies as they were never included in the prior released DVD's, what was with that anyway? As mentioned above, the best movie \\"The Matrix\\" received the least attention, \\"sigh\\" and the two sappy sequels got the most. \\"Of course\\".  The Matrix movie alone may not be enough to spend 60 dollars -- but you need to ask yourself, is \\"Reloaded\\" \\"Revolutions\\" and the countless featurettes worth your dough? Reloaded was decent, Revoluitions was simply a \\"time passer\\" so keep that in mind. But the astonishing sound, action scenes, amazing picture and extras will probably be worth your time especially if you're a fan. But if you're like me, you'll probalby be watching one movie over and over, and it won't be Reloaded and Revolutions.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|The first few seconds into this movie you will know whether or not you love it, or hate it. For me it became an instant comedy classic along with Tommy Boy and Dumb & Dumber. If you sense of humor is often a little warped, you will appreciate this movie.<br /><br />NOTE FOR PARENTS: This movie is completely appropriate. One cuss word is used, no sex or nudity, and no violence. I'm not sure your kids will appreciate it or sit through it, but you won't be embarressed for them to see it.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I have seen Mel Gibson's \\"The Passion of the Christ\\", twice. In many ways it is a beautiful if profoundly disturbing film. It certainly demonstrates with uncompromising and graphic detail, the physical suffering that Christ had to endure because of the sins of humanity. After the first viewing of the film, I had concluded it was a little \\"over the top\\" in terms of the amount and duration of the graphic violence. I found myself sympathetic with what I felt were Gibson's motivations for making the film but intolerant of his technique. I fervently believed at that time that Gibson could have achieved the same impact by merely suggesting violence, by even threatening the possibility of graphic detail without actually ever wallowing in it as he did. I was happy to share that opinion with anyone who was interested. Gibson of course was after a much more visceral reaction from his audience. Gibson wanted to rub people's noses in Christ's suffering and in their own culpability in that suffering. From being forced to view the pieces of flesh and chunks of bone which were torn from Christ's body during the scourging. we were sickened. This was followed by the barely recognizable Christ, with most of the skin tissue lashed from his body, forced to carry His Cross in unknowable agony up to Calvary. This left us gasping with the mixed emotions of revulsion, anger, pity and despair. Ending with the gut-wrenching hammering of the spikes into His bloodied limbs and His flopping helplessly on the Cross like some recently caught fish on a filleting board. We were overwhelmed by the horror of crucifixion.. Curiously, as the weeks passed after my first viewing of the film, a parallel memory, which I had virtually ignored in my disgust with the graphic violence, started to assert itself in sharp relief. I remembered, particularly during Christ's scourging and during his struggle up to Calvary, how struck I was, as if by a hammer, with a sense of the unrelenting intractability of both Satanic and human evil. It was this parallel insight into the nature of evil, which brought me back to watch the film for a second time. On the second viewing I was equally repulsed by the violence but equally I confirmed the great and unapologetic statement Gibson was making about evil and the terrible suffering Christ willingly endured to combat it. Perhaps the degree of graphic detail was not necessary but then again, perhaps, in this age of insensate and clobbered audiences, it was. Sensationalist media coverage of inner city violence, Iraqi terrorism, forced relocations in Darfur, Rwandan machete genocide, etcetera, have numbed and alienated us all from our own emotions. That Gibson, despite the howling of his critics and at considerable professional risk, felt it was necessary to rub our noses in our own filth and degradation for the sake of our possible salvation, is a credit to him as a Christian, an artist and a man.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Okay. I have always been a Star Wars fan, as long as I can remember. I love these movies - and when I saw the DVD versions, it only added to the enjoyment I got from them. I love the modifications Lucas made to the films - though they are only minor changes of course. I don't see why everyone is making such as fuss over them, its not like they totally shifted the flow of the movie - who really cares about the voice dub overs, the added footage, and the appearence by Hayden? Its not like it ruined the movies - I feel that everyone is just blowing this way too far out of preportion - Modified or not, Star Wars is Star Wars - it kicks major ass! I suggest buying them, but if you really dislike the thought of change, than don't buy them. All in all its your call, this is only my perspective.
6305313687|4.0|The breadth of subject matter and the beauty and mastery with which it is presented is what makes this film such a success. Why not the fifth star, you ask? It was close, but a little more could've been done as far as plot and wrap-up with the other members of the Supremists organization. All-in-all, an awesome movie. I will pass on what was told to me: \\"It will make your teeth hurt.\\"  Enjoy.
0767834739|4.0|Dont get me wrong, I loved this movie. There were just a few details that I didnt exactly like. Well not a few, there was 2 details. 1 - There was too big a portion of time missing when Jill and Carlos rescued Alice after she got like \\"revamped\\" with the mind powers and what not. There was like this gap thats left for our imagination to fill. the 2nd thing I didn't really like though it wasnt that big of a deal was the look of the Nemesis. I found it had a very corny look to it - like it didn't look real enough I found. All in all - damn good movie.
B0000CABBW|5.0|I had never heard of this movie until our daughter told us we needed to rent it for a school project. I am so glad we did. IN fact, I just purchased it from Amazon minutes ago...<br /><br />Whale Rider is a tale of hope for a desperate and listless times. The old traditions, while stuck in their ways, still hold value. The future, however, brings change. This movie is about change, the merging of past,present and future.<br /><br />I found it inspirational and beautifully acted, written and directed. This movie should have won many Oscars if it didn't...
B000089RVR|5.0|Woah!... I am one of the biggest Dido fans anywhere and this keeps me right in her fan club. \\"Life For Rent\\" is a beautiful album with gorgeous songs. It starts out with 'White Flag' which is a great song with a catchy hook. 'Stoned' follows and is my favorite song of the album. It makes a good point in a laid back, surprising way. After this, every song is memorable especially 'See You When Your Forty' and 'Do You Have A Little Time'. The final track, 'See The Sun' is a gorgeous song to listen to on a crappy day and the hidden track (\\"Closer\\") can go toe-to-toe with any song on the main part of the record. With all the trash on the radioways (i.e. Britney Spears, Ashlee Simpson...) it's a great reassurance to see someone like Dido sing about things and occurrances that normal people go through in their lives. Thank You Dido for giving the world an amazing album we can ALL listen to.  <br /> <br />Favorite Songs: \\"ALL OF EM\\"
068817776X|4.0|Many other reviewers have chosen to summarize the plot in their reviews.  These reviews capture the essence of the book because it is a straight-forward recollection of Edith's experiences.  While her observations and experiences are terrifying and numbing, to say the least, the book is not painful to read.  The tone is sober and relays Edith's (Grete's) feelings and thoughts, but it does not dwell on the evil and pain generated by the Reich.  Edith does not use this book as a platform to preach against anti-semitism or genocide, which seems to be the focus of so much Holocaust-related literature.  Instead, Nazi Officer's Wife focuses on Edith's own experiences only.   <br />Her story was so compelling that I did not want to put down the book.  It was a fast read and I would definitely recommend it to everyone.  \\"U-boats\\" tend to be forgotten in WWII history and should not be, since they suffered so greatly as they lived in constant fear of discovery in the Reich and the loss of their community and identity.
0743243307|4.0|The Story tells the story of one woman's journey to find her true self-desires, interests, opinions.  I had a difficult time putting it down, but there were parts that were somewhat dry.
0679428895|3.0|Just like the movie, Titanic, this book does not have a surprise ending.  Since the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius and Pompeii's fate are so well-documented and cited in our culture, the audience already has an expectation about the plot and is more likely to be critical.   As a former archaeologist and an Earth Science teacher, I couldn't help but look for inconsistencies.  As other reviewers have pointed out, Harris does come up short in some ways.  However, I really appreciate his approach to the story. <br />The book reads like a mystery, where an aquarius is trying to determine why the aqueduct (the water lifeline) has gone dry.  As he investigates, he encounters many symptoms of impending volcanic eruption, but has no way of knowing this.  He is suspicious and compelled to understand the phenomena, like his acquaintence, Pliny (Yes, Harris does make a character of the epitomal historian).  All the time, Harris reminds us of the science that relates to these phenomena by opening the chapters with excerpts of volcanology resources. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book as a read for a summer vacation at the beach or a cold weekend in blankets.  It is a quick read and is very entertaining and compelling, but does not require reflection or mental exercise.
B00005JN0T|3.0|Like so many reviewers of this movie out there, I am a huge fan of Will Smith but this isn't one of the best things he's done.  All he needed was a partner and it would have been like Men in Black but with robots instead of aliens.  The special effects are not all that impressive considering how far we have come in that department.  This movie is good if watched at a party with a huge group of people but it's not exactly something I would pop in the DVD player when I just feel like a good flick.
B00005QIPH|5.0|... A new age in the possibilities of the new music that can be produced an end to the commercially stale and same old music that has been cranked out of the record companies since the mid '90's.  The Strokes are that possibility like the german expressionistic scene that erupted after World War One a diverse new way to make music has been created.  This is the band of my generation and I intend for that to happen.  The Strokes unlike my generation have a bright future and are the next big thing
B000002UDB|5.0|It seems that nearly every review for MMT has the qualifier of \\"Not in the same league of the Beatles' best stuff but worth owning nonetheless.\\" I suppose I understand the point, as the album is somewhat disjointed and isn't an \\"album\\" so much as a collection of fantastic songs. However, I always felt Rubber Soul was much the same way, and even Revolver to some extent.    Though the first side of the album (or rather through \\"Your Mother Should Know\\") is slightly below the expected greatness of the Beatles, \\"Fool on the Hill\\" and \\"Blue Jay Way\\" are fantastic songs, and the title track is little more repetetive than the much more highly regarded Sgt. Pepper's theme. \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" is even nice and catchy.     And the second side (well, actually \\"I Am the Walrus\\" on) may be the best side of music the Beatles ever made (if not the second side of Abbey Road). You have six beautiful pop songs, ranging from the strangest and most circumspect ideas (\\"I Am the Walrus\\") to the simplest and most important (\\"All You Need is Love\\"). Not to mention Lennon and McCartney's own signature songs in \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and \\"Penny Lane\\", respectively. Perhaps I would choose \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\" as Lennon's best, and \\"Yesterday\\" or the \\"Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight/The End/Her Majesty\\" suite for McCartney's, but these are probably the songs they are known best for, and rightfully so.  \\"Hello Goodbye\\" is an extremely catchy song that reminds one of the Beatles' early and \\"innocent\\" days.    Whether this is actually the most underratted album in the Beatles catalogue is certainly debatable--the beautiful Let It Be rarely gets the credit it deserves as well--but this is truly a must own for any fan of music. Actually, it would probably be an excellent introduction for someone new to the Beatles, as it is extremely accesible because of its \\"collection of singles\\" feel.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|When I first saw this movie, I would have bet it was Hans Zimmer as I recognized the musical style, but it's one his mentorees who has done a fantastic job honoring his mentor, who overproduced this by the way. Even with so many bits reminiscent of Zimmer, you can see Badelt's style emerging. In the world of theatrical scores he is definitely one to watch. <br /> <br />I have a vast collection of movie scores and this makes a fine addition and I'll look out for more of his work to add to the collection. <br /> <br />There are powerful themes and more subtle music mixed in here for a nice balance. I really enjoy the use of horns in the main theme.
0671004107|4.0|Although this science-fiction novel is different than the movie, it was an interesting and fascinating read.  Contact, by Carl Sagan, is the story of a woman in search of extraterrestrial life.  The main character, Ellie, encounters a transmission sent from the stars above and begins to decode the message.  In the process of decrypting the message, Ellie is challenged by government officials, religious leaders, and personal feelings.  While Ellie is allowed to finish deciphering the message, what it contains becomes a world issue causing world governments to take control of the project, and remove her from her position of supervisor.  Although she is irate about the situation she has been put in, Ellie finds what she is looking for in the end. <br /> <br />  This intriguing novel is a great story whether one is interested in astronomy or not.  It is filled with the search of extraterrestrial life, but more so with the life of a woman who is obsessed with the search of other existence in the universe.  If given the opportunity to read this novel, one should not pass the chance, but take advantage of it. <br />
B00005JKC3|4.0|To begin with, I had very low expectations of \\"The Hulk.\\" Many of my friends had gone to see it in the theatre and the basic sentiment among most of them is that it was \\"boring,\\" \\"too-long\\", and \\"confusing.\\" This coming from people who are not simply violent-action movie junkies convinced me to wait until this movie was released on DVD. In a way, I'm glad I did.  <br /> <br />As someone who only has a basic knowledge of Hulklore, I can't authentically critique the movie much when it comes to how well it followed the comic books. What I can say is that in comparison to many other well-adapted comic book series (X-Men, Spiderman, and yes...even Daredevil) this one actually stands out when it comes to how well the main character's inner turmoil and past experiences are used to shape his current conflicts with not only himself, but the forces around him. Eric Bana (who cemented his hunk status with his stunning performance in the lackluster Troy) has received a lot of criticism for his lack of energy in portraying Bruce Banner, but when you consider how repressed and guarded the character is about his past and present emotions, it's obvious that Bana's performance is actually quite impressive in it's accuracy. <br /> <br />Another thing that stuck out to me from a characterization viewpoint is how Sam Elliott's character (the main villain) was far from one-dimensional and actually very relatable and humanistic, especially when it came to his relationship with his daughter Betty (an appropriately subdued portrayal by Jennifer Connelly.) In fact, other than the typical villain-type Talbot (Josh Lucas did very well too, by the way), none of the players in this film were overtly or innately evil. Not even Bruce's psychotic father David (Nick Nolte, in my opinion, took this character to a totally new level of moral ambiguity by adding necessary layers that most likely would have been lost if the character were in the hands of a lesser actor.) <br /> <br />All in all, I'd saythe Hulk was kind of similar to \\"Daredevil\\" in the way that it's cerebral nature can either offend or enamor one to the film's nuances. I for one liked the comic-effect the split screens and overlays supplied, and despite a few awkward scenes the CGI Hulk was astoundingly humanistic in it's movement and especially facial expression.  <br /> <br />Don't be discouraged by those who flat-out hated the movie. Keep an open mind, and don't be surprised if you find yourself enjoying the movie as much as I did.
0440224764|5.0|A huge fan of Grisham, I have read many of his books and this one definately caught my eye.  It was far from a typical mystery; it kept me interested and made me finish it in two settings.  Read this book! You'll get hooked!
0385510438|4.0|John Grisham's latest book really impressed me. When I read this book, I could almost see myself there. I could picture each character, especially Lucien when he was mad in court.  <br />It was very entertaining and funny in many places. It was also suspenseful in many places. I liked how Grisham slowly started with the suspense and then made it more and more suspenseful until the end. If you're looking for a book that will surprise, entertain, and will let you have a good time, read The Last Juror by John Grisham.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I disagree with 'Jamie Hardy', not only am I a fifteen(almost sixteen)year old junior in highschool, I find that I can relate to this more than anyone else. I first saw this movie with my senior friend, her sister, and our art club. We're the semi-nerds at our school and have had the best time watching this DVD over and over again. We bought it on the 30th, my little sister's birthday during a surprise party and made a few new fans out of it. <br />I think that the cast said it best that everyone can relate with at least one of the people portrayed in the movie. For me, it's Napoleon, for my sister, it's Kip, and for my senior friend, it's Deb. This movie has someting for everyone and that's why everyone loves it!
0312995423|5.0|I recently started reading Dan Brown's books starting with the Da Vinci Code. I got Digital Fortress for my birthday and I read it in one day. I loved it. I could not put this book down at all.  <br />At first, many parts seemed to be confusing and not make sense. The more I read, the whole puzzle began to fit together. The plot was very interesting and the characters were colorful. <br /> <br />To the other reviewers that thought this book was a total waste of time, that Brown didn't do enough research and thought this was a one or two star book: <br />    1. This book is fiction (not true). Not all the words in this book is going to be true. Including stuff about cryptology and computers.  <br />    2. This is supposed to be a fun novel that takes you through twists and turns. It's not supposed to be the encyclopedia where everything is accurate.  <br />    3. If it's such a predictible book, why did you finish reading it? Some of you even said: I only read it because I wanted to know what happened. <br />    4. For all those computer \\"geniuses\\" who've read this book and thought it was offensive, this book was out in 1998. That's not very new. Some of the \\"facts\\" probably weren't true because of the date.  <br />    5. You guys need to be more open and imaginative. It doesn't have to be perfect and according to everything that's true. <br /> <br />To readers who are looking for a book that keeps you at the edge of your seat, with a plot that twists and turns until the very end, read Digital Fortress.
B000268QB2|5.0|This band is unique!  They have captured magic in a bottle on their debut LP and have a special talent of making everything sound good...and that includes their LIVE performance as well.  TOM has a GREAT voice that has somewhat of a FREDDY MERCURY quality to it, that even my 9 year old son Joshua recognized.  Tim and Richard are equally talented and playing music that sounds like it is coming from a quartet.  Only one trio in my memory had the talent of making less sound like more...and that was THE POLICE.  This trio will have staying power and will continue to prosper musically for many years to come.
0156027321|5.0|I have never read a book like this before there is lots of adventure and sorrow at the same time. You will never find yourself board, and if you think that it is starting to boar you, you will get pulled back in again and not be able to put it down. <br /> <br />This book is not just told by Yann Martel but the character in the book. He tells you about his life and what kind of adventure he had gone through but after you find out that he is now happy and could has everything he could ever want, you almost think that the events in the book actually happened, it seems so real that it could happen in real life. Yann Martel's writing is phenomenal, he doesn't just write like every other author out there he really talks about the important parts in the book he makes it so you can understand in the non-boring way.  <br /> <br />This book is now my favorite of all time it is mesmerizing, I would defiantly recommend this book to anyone who likes to read or like adventure you will never be able to put it down. This book just may change the way you look at life and how you might take it for granted sometimes. I hope you will read life of pi and think the same way I do. <br />
B00004YYZC|5.0|The year is 1975 and I once read in an interview with Ozzy that he believed he was possessed at this time.  It was right after the release of the movie \\"the Excorcist,\\" that this was released.  Ozzy's vocals are at his best on this album and he truly does sound possessed on some of the tracks.  This album can only be described as Psychadelic Horror Metal.  It's perhaps the most creative album of any band to come out of the 70s.  It starts out with the hard driving \\"Hole in the Sky\\".  This song qualifies as one to blast out your window.  The next piece is \\"Symptom of the Universe.\\"  It's marked by some great riffs by Tony Iommi and ends with some jazzy accoustical guitar.  The next song is \\"Megalomania.\\"  The perfect song to play for one's mother.  It is a Horror masterpiece with a great deal of guitar orchestration and multi-tracking.  Ozzy plays the part of a man possessed and he truely fits the role.  Next is \\"Thrill of It All.\\"  It opens with an orchestra of demonic sounding guitars which feed into a hard driving solo which is among Tony's best work ever.  This song ends by again showing Sabbath's versatility.  \\"Superztar\\" is a trip.  It's operaetic with a metal guitar backround.  \\"Am I Going Insane\\" is the only low point of the album but what it feeds into at the end is classic.  You'll hear laughing and crying that sounds like its from an insane asylum.  Then the bass line will kick in.  Turn the volume up and it'll knock you off your rear.  If Ozzy sounds angry in this song it's because he was.  \\"The Writ\\" was written about Black Sabbath's management that had been ripping them off for years.  It ends with some trippy harp music.  Don't get the US version as they have ruined the feed from \\"Am I Going Insane\\" into \\"The Writ\\"  The original LPs have them feed together as one continuous track but the US versions of the CD switch them in order and cut out the beginning of \\"the Writ.\\"   Hope this is helpful. <br />Norman W. Nonnweiler.
B00008J4P5|5.0|When I bought Elephant, I had heard White Blood Cells, and I wasn't very impressed - I'm not a big fan of punk-sounding music. But this album really blew me away. There are no duds here - every song is different and altogether wonderful. It has everything: mellow and sincere (\\"In the Cold, Cold Night\\", You've Got Her In Your Pocket\\"), upbeat and pleasant (\\"I Just Don't Know\\", \\"The Air Near My Fingers\\"), dark and grim (\\"There's No Home For You Here\\", \\"The Hardest Button to Button\\"), powerful and energetic (\\"Seven Nation Army\\", \\"Ball and Biscuit\\"), souped-up classic rock (\\"Hypnotize\\", \\"Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine\\") and biting punk (\\"Black Math\\", \\"Little Acorns\\"). Needless to say, there is a great variety of songs on this album, and all are done masterfully. Even those who may not care for some of these styles will be able to appreciate them as well-done works and not as a half-baked sonorous backwash of noise. (I'm not naming any names here, but there are plenty of examples in today's music...) Jack is a talented musician and a great writer; all of the lyrics are worth listening to, and some are downwright amazing. The White Stripes take the straight-up rock formula from the past and use it as a vehicle for some fresh and very exciting music. This is one of the few albums that I can honestly say nearly everyone will find enjoyment in.
B000002KKS|5.0|I love Ozzy but I I also love Dio.  This one ranks as my second favorite album of all time behind \\"Diary of a Madman.\\"  Many people think of Dio as just the man who replaced Ozzy in Sabbath but he'd been performing music since 1957.  His first single being released in 1958.  From \\"the Vegas Kings\\" to \\"Ronnie and the Rumblers\\" to \\"Ronnie and the Red Caps\\" to \\"Ronnie Dio and the Red Caps.\\" In 1961 his band became \\"Ronnie Dio and the Prophets.\\"  Under this name he recorded a live LP and many singles.  In 1967 his band became \\"The Electric Elves\\" then it became \\"the Elves.\\"  After a tragic accident where members of his band died and after Dio's own personal recovery from that accident he formed Elf.  Which is where most people know his start.  Throughout the 70s and early 80s it is my belief that Dio had the best voice in music.  Elf led to Rainbow which led to him joining Black Sabbath after Blackmore wanted to go more pop styled with love songs.    This is the first album he did with Black Sabbath and it is the best.  In my opinion this is the best album Sabbath did and the best album Dio did.  It starts out with \\"Neon Knights\\", a song Dio has stated is very dear to his heart.  This is nothing like Sabbath with Ozzy.  There is a more classical feel.  Iommi gets to show his mastery of composition with a strong versatile vocalist in Dio.  \\"Neon Knights\\" is short and fast paced.  A song that sounds great with the stereo cranked.  It's the openning to what I would call the best side of music anywhere.(it was originally released as an LP)  The second song starts soft in trademark Dio style.  Just as the first song though, \\"Children of the Sea\\" is another one to crank.  This song is about a mythilogical people and again draws a lot from classical music.  Next comes \\"Lady Evil.\\"  \\"She eats rats from her hand\\" and this one cranks with a great driving bass line from Geezer.  \\"Heaven and Hell\\" the title track deserves its place as the title track.  There aren't many songs better.  The main riff is hard and heavy and it opens the song.  A simple bass line is all that's heard when the vocals enter.  Dio's vocal performance is great.  From loud to soft to loud, there are a variety of dynamics in this song as there are a variety of tempos.  It ends with a haunting antique sounding lone classical guitar.  The next three songs are good as well though not of the classic stature of the first 4.  \\"Wishing Well\\" \\"Walk Away\\" and \\"Die Young.\\"  The later being the best of the 3.  The last song  is \\"Lonely is the Word.\\"  It starts with an ominous multitracked guitar part that in its simplicity creates a unique and evil sound.  Dio's vocal performance is the best on the album.  It ends with a long solo by Iommi.  Starting out softly with some jazz influence it progresses into Iommi's errie style of lead work.  This is a must for anyone into Dio, Sabbath or any metal for that matter.  It set the standard for the new decade in 1980.  Norman W. Nonnweiler.    For those of you who don't know the History of Ronnie James Dio's early music in the 1950s and 1960s, I have a \\"So You'd Like to Know Guide.\\"  In it you will find a complete discography of everything Dio did in the 1950s and 1960s and there is a lot.
B00005JN0T|4.0|Books aside, the movie stands up pretty well.  Asimov had  <br />envisioned a 0th law (not mentioned in the movie) that robots <br />should protect the human species from itself and over protection <br />of individual humans.  The movie shows what happens when the <br />0th law is taken to an extreme.  The result is Big Brother robot <br />society controlling humanity.  The major deviation from Asimov <br />is the robot created with the ability to ignore the 3 laws and <br />the downloads from the central USR computer (VIKI).  At least <br />the movie makes it easy to identify the unsafe robots by the  <br />red bellies.  The robots don't really revolt against the 3 laws, <br />they're obeying a higher law: the misguided \\"protection\\" of <br />humanity.  In other words, an orderly utopian world without <br />violence, suffering, poverty, etc. except when robots need to <br />cause suffering or act violently for the greater good of society. <br />Bridget Moynihan is great as robopsychologist Dr. Susan Calvin  <br />(one of the few characters from the books).  Also, It is unclear  <br />exactly what role the CEO of USR supposedly has in the robot  <br />takeover.
B000002BE9|4.0|Epic has been holding onto what would be Fiona Apple's 3rd CD for a year and a half now.  They say it isn't commercial enough.  When was she ever commercial?  Its a shame that Epic feels that way.  There is a drive to bug Epic until they release it.  Lets hope it works.   <br />     This is Fiona Apple's first CD and it is a good one.  Different than your typical mainstream pop, it has a jazzy side and you can feel her bend the notes.  She is an original musician unlike the typical pop world where everyone copies each other and there actually only a handful of original songs in existence.  Criminal is the highlight of the CD  but every song is good.  I highly recomend this one for her vocals as well as the piano--for the jazzy feel and the use of differnent dissonances.  This CD has excellent orchestration(instrumentation) and again I like her subtle use of dissonaces. I like the fact that she doesn't try to sound like the rest of the pop and rock world.  Other noteworthy songs would be: Shadowboxer with a great vocal performance,  Slow Like Honey with great piano and vocals.  Never Is a Promise.  Pale September for its use of a dissonant piano part and her vocals and Carrion which has a haunting feel.
0792165020|4.0|\\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" is a subtle and sometimes elegant thriller, of course, it helps that the movie has such a talented cast that includes Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, Cate Blanchett and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, all of them carefully directed by Anthony Minghella. <br /> <br />The strongest points in this movie are the cast of course, and the story. The plot of this film revolves around Tom Ripley, a very clever guy whose specialty is to assume other people's identities. Soon we learn that Ripley has a lot of hidden talents and secrets, most of the time Ripley is using his intelligence to get away with his tricks and scams, but even though he is an elegant criminal, he is also a very disturbed man that once in a while allows his inner demons to dominate him. <br /> <br />\\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" is a showcase to Matt Damon (by the way, he is a better actor and chooses better roles than his untalented fella, Ben Affleck), but the rest of the cast is equally impressive. When the movie came out, we all knew that Gwyneth Paltrow was more than just a pretty blonde girl, she is a fine actress and this movie is another example of her acting talent. \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" also was the introduction of Jude Law to the big audiences, and the supporting cast includes talented people like Cate Blanchett and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. <br /> <br />The locations in this movie are beautiful, and the director Anthony Minghella and the cinematographer John Seale used the beautiful backgrounds to create beautiful visuals. \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" is a clever film and its very interesting to see the story of these characters.
B000002KFJ|5.0|The year is 1975 and I once read in an interview with Ozzy that he believed that he was possessed at this time.  It was right after the release of the movie \\"the Excorsist\\" that this album was released.  Ozzy's vocals are at his best on this album and he truly does sound possessed on some of the tracks.  This album can only be described as Psychadelic Horror Metal.  It's perhaps the most creative album by any band to come out of the 70s.  A word of advice do not get the cheaper versions that have \\"the Writ\\" coming before \\"Am I Going Insane\\" in track order.  This version chops out the beginning of \\"the Writ.\\"  On the original LP \\"Am I Going Insane\\" is before \\"the Writ\\" and feeds directly into it as one continuous track.  You won't get the proper affect if they are out of order. <br />     The album starts out with the hard driving \\"Hole in the Sky.\\"  This song qualifies as one to blast out your window.  The next piece is \\"Symptom of the Universe.\\"   It is marked by some great riffs by Tony Iommi and could qualify as the beginning of thrash metal.  The song ends with some jazzy accoustical guitar work.  \\"Megalomania\\" the next song is the perfect song to play for one's mother.  It is a horror masterpiece with a great deal of guitar orchestration and multi-tracking.    Ozzy plays the role of a man possessed and he truly fits the role.  Next is \\"Thrill of It All.\\"  It opens with an orchestra of demonic sounding guitars that feed into a hard driving solo which is among Tony's best work ever.  It ends in a way again showing the versatility of Sabbath.  \\"Superztar\\" is a trip.  It's operatic with a metal guitar backround.  \\"Am I Going Insane\\" although not bad is the low point of the album but what it feeds into at the end is classic.  You'll hear insane laughing and crying and then the bass will kick in.  Turn up the volume and this song will knock you on your rear.    If Ozzy sounds angry in this song it's because he was.  \\"The Writ\\" was written about Black Sabbath's management that had been ripping them off for years.   It ends with some trippy harp music.  Don't get the cheap version that has the songs out of order!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />To get the full effect of \\"the Writ\\" get a version where \\"Am I Going Insane\\" comes before and feeds directly into \\"the Writ.\\"  They actually cut out some of the intro to \\"the Writ\\" in the cheaper versions of this CD.  Hope this is helpful.
B00005N5S5|4.0|\\"The Terminator\\" is the first installment of one of the best Sci-Fi franchises, but this movie not only is one of the best Sci-Fi movies that you can find, it's also one of the best action movies as well. The story in this movie is so clever that it doesn't matter if some of the visual effects look outdated today, or if some music tracks sound kinda silly, because the plot of this movie must be the most intelligent story about machines. <br /> <br />The main characters have a lot of depth, specially when we are talking about robots. Arnold Schwarzenegger is just perfect for the role of a killer cyborg that travels from the future whose mission is to kill Sarah Connor, the woman that eventually will give birth to John Connor, the leader of the humanity in an apocalyptic future. Sounds cool, doesn't it? <br /> <br />Linda Hamilton plays the role of Sarah Connor, a young woman living a simple live, and overnight she becomes the target of Arnie. At the beginning of the film she is kinda sweet and shy, but at the end of the day she becomes a survivor, fighting for her life and for the life of her unborn child. Sarah Connor is one of the toughest movie heroines that you will ever see (specially in the sequel). <br /> <br />Michael Biehn is also great as Kyle Reese, a warrior that travels from the future to protect Sarah from Arnie. And of course Schwarzenegger found the role of a lifetime in the Terminator franchise, nobody else could fit in this role like Arnie. James Cameron also built a strong reputation with this film, Cameron is one of the best directors in the Sci-Fi or action genres, also he knows a lot of stuff about technical aspects like visual effects and action sequences. <br /> <br />The action sequences are jaw-dropping and thrilling, check out the high speed chases, and of course, the final battle. \\"The Terminator\\" is one of the best Sci-Fi movies, it doesn't matter if some visual effects look dated, because the story will test the proof of time, like the good wines.
B000006TRV|5.0|<br />The Wall is not just an album, it's life story. That's the reason why The Wall is timeless. Touch so many aspects about human life ( isolation, lonelyness, sorrow, hapiness, lies, madness, etc ) that it's the most powerful and touching album ever made.  <br /> <br />It's not a weird thing why this album has been the most succesful one among the Rock albums, and the second one in the music history ( the first one is Michael Jackson ). <br /> <br />The Wall throws the heart out of your chest, makes you to think about your own life and about other ones. <br /> <br />how many albums do you have on which each track is made for the the next number ?. Most of today's music is ephimeral, but The Wall has survived for 25 years and it will keep doing timeless. <br />Most of bands nowadays must release short albums, radio frienly, with 11 or 12 songs containing at least 6 filler numbers. No connection, no meanings, nothing. Just pure commercial crap. <br />But inside The Wall you'll find an experience, those kinds of albums you must listen from the first second until the last one. I mean, even from the very first second ! ( \\"isn't this...when we came here\\". Try to listen those words, if you're astute you'll realise what I'm talking about ). <br /> <br />Moreover, not just in the lyrics you'll find connections and relationships. The music is played tighly, and you'll find a lot of messages on it. For example, the album starts with a few seconds of \\"outside the wall\\" !!. There're a lot of voices before \\"comfortably numb\\" including the teacher ( appeared at the end of \\"another brick in the wall part II ), the girl ( appeared at \\"one of my turns\\", etc. Even you'll find \\"echoes\\" guitars on \\"is there anybody out there\\" !!. That's makes the album so exciting and interesting. You'll find a lot of secret messages on it, unlike boring and predictable today's music.  <br />I know you've listen a lot \\"Another Brick In The Wall Part II\\", \\"Comfortably Numb\\", \\"Run Like Hell\\" and played a lot that classic guitar from \\"Is There Anybody Out There\\". But The Wall is so fantastic that makes you forget the previous songs while you're listening to the next ones. That's amazing, keeping you inside the main history told in this album. <br /> <br />This album is a book of life, a life filled with extraordinary music and lyrics.  <br /> <br />THE MOST MAGNIFICENT MASTERPIECE FROM MUSIC HISTORY <br /> <br />PS: I really want to see someday Pink Floyd The Wall Live DVD ( there's enough footage filmed both on 1980 and 1981 !!!!! ) <br />
044024157X|4.0|Although John Grisham has followed the likes of James Patterson and David Baldacci in recent years, and successfully moved away from the formula that made him rich, it wasn't until I'd read 50 pages or so of \\"The Last Juror\\" that I finally got the joke.  Although sold as a legal thriller -- the front cover illustration on the paperback edition is a jury deliberation room -- this book does not have a lawyer as a protagonist.  And there is no $30 million at stake, driving the characters' motivation.  This is new ground for Grisham: a legal thriller, without the lawyers. <br /> <br />What follows in this book will test your devotion to the Grisham legal thriller formula.  He is not interested in plot this time around: although the back cover sells the book as the story of a jury being killed off, member by member, nine years after their deliberation in a sensational Southern murder trial, you will have read 400 of the book's first 475 pages before any juror actually dies.  And while the various Clanton, Mississippi characters will be familiar from older Grisham novels (slovenly divorce lawyer Harry Rex Vonner -- the soul of Joe Don Baker in the body of Oliver Platt -- shows up for at least his third Grisham outing), the main character is a Northern journalist who accidentally finds himself publishing a small town weekly.  The novel's title character is an older black woman who unwittingly winds up as the keystone figure in Clanton's long-overdue integration. <br /> <br />That's really all you need to know about \\"The Last Juror\\".  You already know that a lot of space will be devoted to descriptions of Southern food and religious practices.  Grisham writes with his usual flurry of self-contained chapters, so that you can finish the book in literally a few hours if you have a mind to.  He doesn't mind digressing -- the action stops dead about 50 pages before the end, when our journalist hero tries to block Wal-Mart from colonizing Clanton.  And you'll also be able to figure out who done it long before the author tells you. <br /> <br />The bottom line is standard fare for Grisham, but with a twist.  The blurb for his forthcoming hardcover also appears to advertise a book without a lawyer protagonist.  However, you need not be afraid that Grisham is losing his touch with what made him famous: \\"The Last Juror\\" is still classic Grisham, even without the lawyers and the guns and the money.
B00014TJ6Q|5.0|This is Harrison's seemingly comeback album after taking a few years off and after several music critics seemed to cliquishly attack his music as if all they listened to was Harrison's Dark House single making assumptions that he was done in spite of some very fine work in between like 33 1/3. Harrison received many positive reviews for the first time in years possibly due to the up beat pop sounds of commercial hits \\"Blow Away\\" and \\"Love Comes to Everyone\\" but also because it contains a bit of nostalgia with \\"Not Guilty\\" and \\"Here Comes the Moon\\". The latter being a take off of \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" (\\"a little brother to the sun\\") but the former is more an introspective of the Beatles' problems indicating that they were struggling to stay together a few years before the break. \\"Not Guilty\\" is about the trip to the Maharishi, which turned disastrous and this is Harrison's response to any blame put on him (written in 68). The Album also features significant points in Harrison's life, his relationship with his then future wife in a sweet ballad called \\"Dark Sweet Lady\\" and his fascination with race cars in the story of racing in \\"Faster\\" that plays some energized riffs. Harrison also includes his sense of humor in \\"Soft Hearted Hanna\\", which sounds like a fun throwback tune with a tuba playing in the background. It sounds somewhat familiar to some of Harrison's Extra Texture tunes. My personal favorites are \\"Love Comes To Everyone\\", which is a pretty snappy tune full of positive statements and music with perhaps the best lyrics and music that flows nicely with the lyrics and \\"Soft Touch\\", which features some unique guitar work that is uniquely Harrison with a tumble down sound on the guitar that is as unique as the waltz like riffs on \\"I, Me, Mine\\". Overall this is very positive sounding album by a happy Harrison with plenty of upbeat songs such as \\"If you Believe\\" and \\"Your Love is Forever\\". In many ways, the pop hit \\"Blow away\\" is the weak song on the album, Harrison's personal happiness is evident and his creativity thrives with the guitar. This one, as 33 1/3 should have, aptly puts to bed the any false stereotype that Harrison only wrote dirges.'s personal happiness is evident and his creativity thrives with the guitar. This one, as 33 1/3 should have, aptly puts to bed the any false stereotype that Harrison only wrote dirges.
B00005QW4K|2.0|I bought this in the hope that I'd see more Bruce Campbell wise cracks. What you get is the theatrical feature with ungraded cuttings from the editing room floor glued in with chewing gum and paperclips. The original film is one of my all time favorites and this version proves that editors do a very good job by removing anything that is unneccesary, misleading or of poor film-making quality. This DVD is basically everything that is great about Army of Darkness with added unneccesary, misleading and poor quality footage. <br /> <br />Hail to the Editors baby!
044651652X|4.0|The Bridges of Madison County, is a touching and inspiring book that teaches you to go for your dreams but also to accept your responsibilities and then take action. The love that Robert and Francesca have for each other is so strong you can almost feel it while you read the book, (which i could not put down). The story is just so sweet because its about a one of the last cowboys and simple farm wife that fall in love under the covered bridges of madison county, there are some twists and turns along the way, but you'll just have to read it for yourself to find out, it is a great book that I would suggest to anyone looking for a good, sweet love story.  That is why I give this book four stars and I cant wait to rent the DVD as well.
038572179X|5.0|I am seventy years old, have been reading all my life, and cannot remember ever reading a novel that astonished me more.  Mc Ewan's moral imagination transferred in the four parts of the book between different protagonists at different times, his mastery of the relevant detail, his integration of the apparently disparate parts, is breathtakingly orchestrated.  We start with the voice of a privileged and precocious thirteen year old in 1935 and end with the same person more than six decades later.  There is a long and very powerful evocation of the retreat to Dunquerque, an interlude in a wartime British military hospital, a birthday celebration for a seventy seven year old writer.  All of them are reflections on our ability and inability to exercise moral imagination, and on the tie between the exercise of that imagination and our self-realization as human beings.  The disparate parts of the book are brought together very powerfully at the end - like listening to fine symphonic music, wonderful in itself, mysterious in our inability to predict where it is going, and perfect once it has taken us there.
0385493622|5.0|If Simon Singh writes it, I am going to read it. He is that good and that dependable as a writer. Just as he did with \\"The Code Book,\\" he as taken a potentially dull subject and turned it into a brilliant read. Reading this book you will be completely entertained, while at the same time learning a huge amount about the history of mathematics. Unlike what you might think, this history reads like well constructed novel, with strong character development and no shortage of twists and turns in the plot. When you finish this book, you will feel very good about the time you spent reading it. It gets my highest review.
1591840562|5.0|I found The Art of The Start full of common sense laid out in such an organized, informative way, that I feel empowered by having read it.  It was the most enjoyable non-fiction book that I have read in ages! Overall a helpful, uplifting and fun read.  For anyone involved in start-ups, this book will help improve your odds of success.
0385495323|5.0|Simon Singh has a true gift for writing. In the wrong hands the material presented in this book could have been dull. Mr. Singh, however, turns this material into what reads likes a page-turning novel. This book is loaded with fastinating information presented in clearly written manner. If you have even the slightest interest in the subject matter, I promise you that you will love this book. One of the things that makes it great is that it looks as deeply at people as it does at the science and math involved. You will find yourself getting attached to the men and women who were so heavily involved in the developments in this subject matter throughtout history. For a top-notch learning and entertainment experience, go read this book now.
B00001SIES|5.0|I like both bands, Muse and Radiohead, and I don't see why they are compared. They have nothing in common, exept that they make both emotinal music. Although I like Radiohead more, this album is still excelent. This is Muse at their rawest, most emotinal and simply at their best, although this is the least accesible of all their albums. The stand out-tracks are Showbiz, Sober, Cave, Escape, Unintended, (of course) Muscle Museum and strangly enough I do like Overdue alot. Showbiz and Muscle Museum are by far the most exciting tracks on the album, you can really lose yourself in one of those songs. Sober is lyrically a masterpiece, Cave is a first class rock-song, Unintended is more mellow and Overdue is poppy and very catchy. Sunburn is an emotionally great intro. What the hey, they are all great songs on this album, Muse at it's best like I said before. Although I don't recommend this to buy if you're new to Muse. Buy Origin Of Symmetry if you're new. Buy this if you want Muse's masterpiece.
B00003CXC7|5.0|...more of the characters, more of the neighborhood, more about how the movie was made. Genius, pure genius. Be sure to watch the \\"making of\\" documentary that is included - my admiration for Hithcock grew as I watched. Clever set and an even more clever director.<br /><br />This movie was a pure joy. I had never seen it before (in fact it is only my second Hitchcock movie! Yes, I have been neglecting my education!) and this goes right into my personal top ten list!
B000002LCD|3.0|I did not see this movie and bought the CD only for my collection. So so sountrack with good dance songs, specially the ones from Madonna: Can't Stop, The Look of Love, Who's that girl (A number 1 track) and one of my all-time Madonna favorites Causing a Commotion, love this song that peaks at #2 in the billboard charts.
B00005JN0T|4.0|I watched this DVD with trepidation.  The previews looked like they had pretty much thrown out Asimov's basic plotlines, but they didn't.  Will Smith plays a detective in 2035, which is populated by robots as delivery robots, servants, dog walkers, etc.  Almost any job not requiring a lot of thought could be done by a robot.   <br /> <br />The chief robotic scientist, who developed the 3 laws and designed the first general purpose robots, commits suicide, or was he murdered by a robot?  Will Smith is called in as a detective who doesn't not like or trust robots, despite the rest of the world trusting them completely.  He follows the clues left to him by the dead scientist to solve the case. <br /> <br />In the end, I could see this movie as having been an Asimov story. <br /> <br />I give the movie 5 stars, however, the extras on the DVD are disappointing, hence the overall rating of 4 stars.
B000002L6P|5.0|Even tough here 1983 self-titled debut had some hits mostly in the club areas and generated such hits as Holiday and Borderline; Like a Prayer was her very first masterpiece that gives the world an idea or what Madonna could do.  <br />This album generated her first number one in the USA, the title track stayed 6 weeks at the top of the charts in Dec 1984. This album would have another big chart-toppers as Angel, Material Girl (with a very nice video), Love don't live here anymore and the International addition track for this album and an eventually world dance it Into the Groove.  <br />For pop and Madonna fans only, and for anyone to wants to have a classic in their collection.

B000002L9S|5.0|This was Madonna's third studio album, containing 9 tracks: <br /> <br />1. Papa don't preach.- A number one song for two weeks, big controversy about the theme of the song, the baby is her boyfriend or is she pregnant? 5/5 <br />2. Open your heart.- Stayed at number 1 one week, very sexy video in a brothel. 5/5 <br />3. White Heat.- Odd song with a rap, not a personal favorite. 3/5 <br />4.

Lift me up every time I hear it. 5/5 <br />6. True Blue.- A number 2 song that has trascende time, one of her best ballads. 5/5 <br />7. La Isla bonita.- One of her first latin-inspirated songs, a personal favorite from her since has been played in all of her tours but the last one, top at number 4. 4/5 <br />8. Jimmy Jimmy.- Catchy song. 3/5 <br />9. Love makes the world go round.- Another dance song with a message. 3/5 <br /> <br />The album worth for the 5 singles and Where's the party, she sure knows where!
B00005JL0I|2.0|Great cast, cinematography, and great location shots in Scotland and England, but really - the movie is just TOO silly.  There is very little artful comedy here. I think a lot of rich movie people got together to make this on a lark, to celebrate themselves, and to enjoy a six week long party.<br /><br />Don't waste your time, unless you're REALLY bored and have absolutely nothing else to do.
0784010501|4.0|If you are not a Madonna fan, this dvd will be worth just for the live performances or part of(Express Yourself, Oh Father, Like a Virgen, Promise to try, Holiday, Live to tell, Causing a commotion and Keep it together). <br />If you are a fan you can see Madonna close and somehow personal during her Blond Ambition tour back in 1990. At that time she was the most famous wild and single girl in the music world (now she is a very more respected artist), you can see how she prepares for each concert, all the commotion involved, how the crew becomes her family and how fame can be a prision sometimes. Film mostly in black and white is a representation of how a tour is and all the elements involved in it.
0783225199|5.0|I'd say this is my favorite movie. The only movie that can compete with it, for me, is Back to the Future. This movie is very funny, The acting is superb, and on top of all that the music is terrific! There are appearences by Aretha Frankin, John Lee Hooker, Cab Calloway, James Brown and Ray Charles. The movie begins with Jake Blues getting out of jail and his brother Elwood coming to pick him up..... in a police car! Turns out Elwood traded their old Cadillac for a microphone and baught this police car second hand. After picking up Jake from jail, Elwood drives him to the orphanage where they grew up to visit the Nun who runs it.   Elwood: \\"You Promised you'd visit the Penguin the day you got out\\"  Jake: \\"Yeah... so I lied\\"  Elwood: \\"You can't lie to a Nun!\\" \\"We gotta go in there and visit the Penguin\\"  So, reluctantly, they go in to visit \\"Tht Penguin\\" During the visit they find out that the orphanage can't afford to pay it's $5,000 in property tax, and is going to be sold to the board of education. Jake and Elwood are determined to get the tax money before it's too late, and decide to get their old band back together to raise money for the orphanage(after the Sister refuses to take their stolen money). I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of comedy and good music.

0156027321|5.0|This is one of the most incredible books I've read in a long, long time.  All avid readers have known the odd mixed feeling of satisfaction and emptiness upon finishing a really good book, and this is one of those - you will find yourself missing the characters and wishing that their story would continue, as well as searching for another read that will prove as satisfying.  You will search for quite some time (but Louise Erdrich works well :) <br /> <br />I've just finished reading Life of Pi for the second time, and it's amazing what a different perspective this brings to the book.  I'll admit that I rather missed the whole point of the thing on the first read, being so caught up in the action.  (I can't understand how some Amazon reviewers have found the book boring, or a slow read; I was on the edge of my (airplane) seat the whole time, utterly in thrall!) <br /> <br />The core idea of the novel is one that will keep you thinking for a long time after you've absorbed the story.  I highly recommend it as a book for college courses and discussion groups, and to anyone who appreciates a powerful work of imagination.
B000067CPX|5.0|This is an album that will stand the test of time and will eventually be looked back when the Red Hot Chili Peppers are Rock Legends in the world of music.......this album portrays emotion in a  whole new level it also brings the Californication feel back only it advantages it to make it a more deeper experience the songs on this album are top notch 5 star epics (It will be hard for the Peppers to top this album) but all in all 2 thumbs up good job Boys you did it again
B0002KVUKM|2.0|I saw the film for the first time last night on DVD.  <br />The first annoying thing about it is that it seems to have a hard time deciding whether it wants to be a spoof, e.g. \\"Love At First Bite\\" or a serious endeavor e.g. \\"Dracula\\".......in either case they definitely missed their mark. <br />In the opening sequence we see Dracula finish off Dr. Frankenstein and then later he is seen lamenting, that he really needs Herr Frankenstein to bring his 'babies' to life. I am wondering \\"wait a minute did you not ravish him earlier? so why is he not one of your minions at your beck and call?\\"....that was never addressed. <br />By the way, I think Jackman made a very interesting Van Helsing......(wasn't the earlier version an old, cranky doctor with a daughter Mena???)...a younger, more vibrant Van Helsing was a vast improvement to me....... <br />And speaking of Van Helsing, who is he exactly??? The film never adequately identifies him, at least for me.....Early on we learn he was picked up on the steps of the Vatican.......later he speaks of witnessing the destruction at Masada, which leads me to consider he is either a vampire, like Vlad, or an immortal e.g. Duncan MacLeod....so which is it? Later the confusion about his identity is further compounded when we discover, along with Anna and his faithful monk Carl, that he has been bitten by Anna's brother, who is now a monstrous werewolf. So does this mean that he is NOT impervious to fatal wounds? apparently not, so that leaves out the possibility that he is a vampire or an immortal.......and speaking of werewolves, I could not believe how much they hauled out for this film....every nightmare you could conjure up e.g. werewolves, vampires, Frankenstein etc. I was unaware of all of this, i.e. that it was full of 'problems' for Van Helsing when all along I thought it was just 'Vlad' and his 'brides' who Van Helsing would be dealing with. Also, the 'babies' Vlad was wailing about looked more like gargoyles than junior vampires.....In the film, I think it speaks of the 'babies' being a result of crossing vampires and what? <br />I thought Richard Roxburgh did well in the role of Count Dracula.....I just wish they had been able to make up their mind as to what they wanted him to do with the role. Half of the time, he was doing a schtick routine of Louis Nye and the rest of the time Gary Oldman. <br />In the final scenes we are left with the impression that the producer envisioned maybe a sequel or two which would be the further adventures of Van Helsing and Carl?  <br />I think not......... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
1878424432|5.0|I am referring to the audio version of this book: <br /> <br />This is a real gem that can turn ones life around, it oozes of magic. I don't usually give 5 stars, but here goes. I recommend buying this book.
0767834739|1.0|Who hired this director? Not one scene in the movie works! What a waste. Being a big fan of the games I was hoping to get at least a decent follow-up to the watchable first installment. But Apocolypse is a disaster. This movie is all over the place and I was bored after two minutes. The only good thing about the film is Milla, although she is lost in the midst of a forgettable cast. And the zombies...oh my God this amateur director uses slow motion and some cheesy blur effect to make them \\"scary\\"!!! Terrible. My advice is rent Shaun of the Dead or the brilliant Dawn of the Dead remake if you want to see a fun zombie movie. Resident Evil is a great concept but the producers have to start hiring better talent to realize its potential.
0783225857|1.0|Boring!  Why do so many people like the book and movie?  I had to read the it in three weeks (three chapters every weekday), and it was not good at all.  My teacher then gave us the choice to watch To Kill a Mockingbird or All Quiet on the Western Front (another classic we read prior to To Kill...) for our final.  And lucky me, I'm in a class with students who not only voted for To Kill... but they didn't even watch it.  But that's beside the point.  To Kill... seemed to have no plot whatsoever.  Not only that but it was not fun to watch/read.  The little conflicts Scout and Jem find themselves in are outrageously dumb.  Do not watch, do not read... stay ignorant of Harper Lee.
B00005JLEX|4.0|As time goes by some comedies stay fresh. I think it would be great to live next door to these people, instead of other neighbors. They may not be real but they are funny.
1594200106|5.0|This has to be the best book I read in 2004.  I was just absorbed with the characters and plot.  There is a simple elegance to the writing.  Its a wordy novel yet somehow they all fit together as a unified whole.  I cannot help but tell anybody and everybody to read this novel.
B000002U82|5.0|this is one of the greatest floyd objects to be manufactured on this earth (or wherever floyd was from). A+
B000002UAU|5.0|One reviewer wrote at the time of \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" release was that it was a moment in pop music where black and white turned into color.  It's that pronounced a record in the annals of musical history.  And despite pushing the boundries with their 2 previous discs \\"Rubber Soul\\" and \\"Revolver,\\" with \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" it's a different level altogether--all the way down to the then innovative cover design.<br />Though in theory it's a concept album, the Beatles themselves  disavowed that later.  It certainly starts that way with the title track: \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" which even sounds light years from what they did barely 10 months ago.  All the instruments seem to have a sharper defined tonal quality that made previous records seem almost dated.  McCartney's bass, for example, is so much more hilighted in the mix it's almost as if he's playing a lead bass on some songs.  This cut leads right into the Ringo sung \\"With a Little Help From My Friends.\\"  Ringo is finally given a proper song to sing, instead of a cornball country tune or some novelty song or a Lennon/McCartney throwaway.  The songs theme is Ringo's persona and he easily wins us over with his self effacing performance. Super job.  \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\"  shows John's gift of wordplay never deserting him---even in psychedelia.  In fact, it's never been better.  \\"Getting Better,\\" inspired by temporary tour replacment drummer Jimmy Nichol, is a superb song featuring a light/dark side of the Beatles: the verses shimmering with optimism and great Beatle harmonies give way to the middle filled with a heaviness and pessimism.  It's this give and take that give the song it's excellence.  \\"Fixing a Hole\\" would be my choice for underrated gem on this disc.  For Paul, the words are outstanding and the electric guitar which echoes the meleody line, hold the song together really well.  While being a good song, \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr Kite\\" taken away from \\"Pepper\\" doesn't really stand on it's own.  It's a great marriage of music and words however.  You can literally feel the circus in the song.  \\"She's Leaving Hone\\" showcases the Beatles(always) superb vocal harmonics to their best abilites.  The voices just blend with the orchestration.  \\"When I'm 64\\" is Paul doing his old-time shtick.  Here it's sublime as he hits all the right spots, especially the clarinets wistfully playing over Ringo's shuffle as Paul sings the woes of aging.  Paul would do this type of song again many times in his career but never as good as here.  \\"Within You, Without You\\" is George's contribution to this set.  And although it's not as commercially accesible as his previous Indian(\\"Love You To\\")song, the words are far more spiritual.  Next comes \\"Lovely Rita\\" which is probably the purest pop number on this disc so far, even with the honky-tonk pianio.  After everything you've listened to up to his point it's very welcome.  \\"Good Morning, Good Morning\\" features Sounds Incorporated on horns blasting John Lennon's televison based song forward.  Listen for Ringo's inspired drumming under the mix.  \\"Sgt. Pepper's (reprise) is a super gap filler.  Faster and more stripped down than the title track, its exuberance puts you at the somber door of \\"A Day in the Life.\\"  \\"A Day in the Life\\" could be the crowning achievment of their career.  A mini-opera fueled by Lennon's imaginative words and George Martin's rising and falling orchestration and brought thunderously home by Ringo's timpani- like drums.  It's one of those rare times that music can leave you breathless when it's over.  Deserving of every accolade given, it's a masterpiece.<br />And pretty much can be said about the album.own.

B0006399FS|5.0|I knew after the masterpiece that was the \\"The Joshua Tree\\", that U2 would have to try really hard to top it. They did with 1991's \\"Achtung Baby\\". Not only did that album top it - it blew it out of the water. <br /> <br />So it was only a given that U2 would keep experimenting, and in the process, wrote some of their best songs in the 90's. But who says that EVERY album must be another inovation? Reviewers like Mofo seem to think so.  <br /> <br />In 2000, came a fantasticly stripped down album called \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind.\\" It had great songs, and maybe some not so great ones. One thing it did not have enough of was The Edge. <br /> <br />\\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\\" marks the full return of the guitar. Edge shines here! I think some tend to think that he should return to the crazy guitar/non-sounding guitar of some of U2's 90's work. Why can't he just be The Edge? THIS is what he sounds like! He'll tell ya the same thing! <br /> <br />U2's latest release is probably their most complete sounding album of all time, next to \\"Achtung Baby\\". While \\"The Joshua Tree\\" was brilliant, it had more 'filler'.  <br /> <br />\\"HTDAAB\\" starts off incredibly well with pure rock and roll adrenaline. \\"Vertigo\\" is the sound of four guys just jammin in the garage not because of money, but because they just love to ROCK! Yes, they allowed Apple to use this song for IPOD commercials, but no money exchanged hands.  <br /> <br />The albums highlights include \\"Miracle Drug\\", \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\", \\"City of Blinding Lights\\", \\"Man and a Woman\\" and \\"Original of the Species.\\"  <br /> <br />This is U2 in top form, just writing great songs that sound like U2. If you aren't enjoying it, maybe you should try something a bit lighter. I hear that Destiny's Child just released a new album....
B00005JMYI|4.0|Adam Mckay's Anchorman is a pretty funny, comedy/sex romp starring Will Ferrell doing what he is known for making a jackass of himself for our amusement. He is superbly funny in the movie despite the many shortcoming the movie has. For example  Ferrell's cast members like Steve Carrell are not funny at all,  in fact he has some stupid lines in the movie.    For instance after everyone gets drunk at Ron's party , his character Brick Tamland mentions the awful thing he did: \\"I ate a red candle\\". Later on in an office meeting when its announced  tbat a woman will enter the hormone male infested world of  KWN Brick yells but admits he doesnt know why. This is not  funny, I think Steve was tacked in at the last moment as a favor for somebody.    As someboy else mentioned if you never seen any of Ferrel's  stuff youll not only think its not funny but offensive as well.  Ron Burgundy while prouding himself as a \\"stud\\" is completely  offensive to women, theyre just sex objects to him.    Even when an Angel appears in Veronica Corningstone, he cant help but make a fool of himself in picking her  up:  \\"You have a breaktaking heinie\\", he says. LMAO    Later on when the two are working together, he cant even  give keep his physical attraction from her:  \\"Mr. Burgandy you have a massive erection\\" says Veronica Corningstone.    What the hell is this? Porn talk. LOL    But since the movie takes place in the 70's with these loose  morals, one expect this in \\"Anchorman\\". I recommened it only for Ferrel fans.    The dvd as well despite having a boatload of extras is somewhat  disappointing in the commentary track, with Ferrell only kidding around and telling jokes but giving no details about h9w the movie was made. For that I recommend the featurette on the film.    Anyhow \\"Anchorman\\" is a funny movie.
B000687M48|4.0|I really enjoyed this CD.  This is a great band with a bright hopefully LONG future.
B000001ELR|5.0|I can't be labeled a Kiss fan. I like Kiss about as much as I like Heart, Foregner and maybe even Boston. I consider these groups excellent for what they did in their time and I enjoy many of their songs and own several of their CDs. Kiss, to me, is a great band but not the best I've heard. I actually get repulsed at the songs, \\"Cold Gin\\" and \\"Firehouse\\". And I also think Gene Simmons' rap on \\"Christine Sixteen\\" is very putrid and embarrassing. <br /> <br />However, when Kiss rocked they rocked well. And what was sad is that there weren't more albums like Creatures Of The Night. And in reality the closest we got to Creatures was twice with Revenge in 1992 and Psycho Circus in 1997. <br /> <br />I say all of this for the fact that this album is about as classic as any of the hardest rocking albums in history (up there with Led Zeppelin's IV and possibly even a good Judas Priest or Iron Maiden album). <br /> <br />Creatures Of The Night was a turning point Kiss was looking for but it took them in the wrong direction. 1983's Lick It Up was a cliche by all meanings of the word and the following two albums didn't stray from that sad distinction. Asylum not as good as Animalize but all three albums are boring heavy metal done better by Aerosmith's worse albums. <br /> <br />But what sets Creatures apart is it's thunderous approach and how the album, only represented by \\"I Love It Loud\\" which could have been the best possible advertisement one would need to show you what's on the inside of the album, is distinctly a true heavy metal album with no flash, no flair, no blood and no tongues. Kiss did right by music history by releasing this album, but it was a shame to know that Kiss lost it's fan base by this time and this album was buried under the miles of crap from such cliches out there in those days. <br /> <br />Amazingly - but not really, is the songwriting contribution of Bryan Adams, who just that same year broke out with his Cuts Like A Knife album and the ballad, \\"Straight From The Heart\\". <br /> <br />Bryan contributed \\"War Machine\\" and \\"Rock and Roll Hell\\" which are both, by nature, extremely well crafted HEAVY METAL tracks and two good reasons to even consider listening to this album. <br /> <br />Eric Carr was one of the most classic of drummers in his time and unfortunately better than Peter Criss many times. But it was Criss' style that assited in opening the floodgates of the Kiss Army. And Eric's drumming on here gives this album the same stylings Criss did on the earlier albums. Carr is certainly deserving of any accolades we give him because he was a mild personality who spoke through his drumset and gave everything he had to Kiss. <br /> <br />Put away any prejudsism you have against Kiss and don't think about the make-up or the flash Kiss could give you, and listen to this album with the knowledge in knowing that Kiss was truly a great rock band and this album certainly helped. <br />
B000065V41|5.0|When Jim Henson passed away, Brian Henson (his son) decided to pick a new type of project for the Muppet films in the arena of literature adaptation.  Well, he pulled it off, and he could not have made a better choice than to tackle Dickens' Christmas Classic: A Christmas Carol.    The Muppets are the characters, but people are along for the ride too, such as Michael Caine who stars as Scrooge himself.  With their quirky Muppet styles, and Caine's good acting this movie goes far in presenting this story to a new generation over and over again.  The story, with many of the original lines, has all of the joy and sadness of the story, but with so much more liveliness.    I highly recommend this film, as it will probably become a Christmas classic in your household.  Adults and kids will like this, and maybe not just in December either.
B00000AF95|2.0|<br />...they really rock. And I have to admit, shamefully, that the 80's Kiss albums are rock-laden collections that can put a party into full effect. But in reality these albums, Lick It up, Animalize and Asylum, are extremely boring rock albums with no direction (as stated in my Lick It Up review). <br /> <br />I think Tim Curry's 1979 Fearless album was more exciting than this trio of albums. And it's a shame to have to say so because Kiss is definately rock legends and certainly not your fly-by-night band of dumb kids with no senses left. <br /> <br />But the days of old, those prehistoric 80's, says that heavy metal had to be boring with alot of hair and girls to spike up the punch at a party. But when you require good music in your library, it's very important to note Kiss' 80's trio of crap is not where your interests should lie. <br /> <br />THe 80's were a systematic time for Kiss where every move they made was mainly scrutinized by former fans who were sick up to here with Kiss because of the big letdown Kiss was noted for. But when you release a classic collection in the form of Creatures Of The Night and then turn around and barrage us with mediocre crap in the form of Lick It Up, Animalize and Asylum, you really need a vacation to reasses where you're going in life. It's a trick Paul McCartney needed to do by 1986 when he released the first pile of crap he saw. Kiss was certainly in need of a good overhaul - and that didn't happen until 1992's Revenge. <br /> <br />AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Rolling Stones, The Who, The Beatles and Kiss. They all seem synonymous with rock history and legendary rock and roll. But it was over when John Bonham died, when Ozzy was fired, when Keith Moon died and when Kiss took off the make-up and wanted to be noted as serious musicians. Well history will tell you they were taken serious with the make-up on the music was inventive.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Well, many great debut bands earmark this year, and Franz Ferdinand stands out as one of the most prominent of these..    This Scottish four-piece has come together to make a fine album.  Songs like Take Me Out gain the radio play, but others such as Matinee and This Fire deserve high praise as well, as they may be the better songs.    My radio DJ once said if there is one album to get then get Franz Ferdinand.  Well, I would have to agree, because pop or not this band is precociously good.
B000001EL3|5.0|Typically one would have to buy a few albums and re-record their own 'party tape' to get what they would call the perfect album. However, you may not need that in this case. <br /> <br />Destroyer is one of the finer classic rock albums of our time simply for the fact that every song on here is not typical of Kiss' catalog and every song is classic in it's approach and just leaves you wanting more. <br /> <br />\\"Beth\\" was it's own classic, but I still can't get over the obvious Elton John rip-off it was [Border Song, 1970]. However, when listening to \\"Beth\\" you can't help but know what it was Peter Criss was trying to get across and to who he was doing it for. <br /> <br />Kiss is legendary for a reason and this album has justified why.
B00008YLV2|5.0|It's really that good! \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is one of the greatest war films I've seen, almost as good as \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and \\"Platoon.\\" Director Ridley Scott rarely has disappointed me; he is in top form here. <br />The film documents the events that took place on October 3-4, 1993 in Mogadishu, Somalia. U.S. Army Rangers and Delta Force were assigned to arrest two lieutenants of warlord Mohammed Farrah Aidid. The raids were supposed to take 45 minutes, but two Black Hawk helicopters ended up being shot down, and it turned into a 16 hour bloodbath. In the end, 19 Americans and over 1,000 Somalis were killed. The film focuses on the American soldiers, played by such actors as Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore, Eric Bana, and William Fichtner. Sam Shepard and Orlando Bloom play smaller parts. <br />The acting? It was decent enough, but then it didn't have to be that great. Scott's direction was superb. The cinematography was outstanding, as well as the other technical aspects (the film received Oscars for Film Editing and Sound).  <br />I can't tell you just how good \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is. It's the best war movie I've seen since \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" by far. Nothing else has come close. It's quite gory in some scenes, but it's well worth seeing.
B000089RV6|5.0|<br />    Back In Black is possibly a flawless album. It rocks in places it needed to and slows down the pace where it's relevant. Where \\"Shoot To Thrill\\" was a touch of what Bon Scott gave AC/DC, \\"Hell's Bells\\" slows down the pace to a practically demonic sludge. You are guaranteed to commence in headbanging no matter where you drop the needle. <br /> <br />    Brian Johnson, as suitable as he is as a replacement for the most excellent Bon Scott, still gives Back In Black the character it needed to make this album truly a classic hard rock set. <br /> <br />    And oddly enough, the album can actually be deemed important, not for the well known cuts, \\"You Shook Me All Nite Long\\" and \\"Back In Black\\", but also for the lesser known cuts, \\"Let Me Put My Love Into You\\", \\"Have A Drink On Me\\"  and \\"Given The Dog A Bone\\". And even though \\"Rock and Roll Ain't Noise pollution\\" falters slightly, you can still make this album out to be one of the truest rock classics still alive today. <br /> <br />    Some will tell you, \\"It's not Bon Scott!\\" and they'd be right. It's not. But it is the second phase of a great rock band who never gave you filler. Ever notice there is no Greatest Hits collection? Don't need one. Any album is a super set of classic rock treasures.

B00008BXJG|5.0|[excerpted from a 1999 radio show by Joanne] <br /> <br />    You take all of the AC/DC albums ever recorded and released and none of them will show the band at their best than this album. Highway To Hell is not only one of AC/DC's best, but it also stands as one of the greatest rock albums ever released. So much in fact, that today I can't hear a single dated song that shows the bands time of peak. <br />    This was the perfect opus to Bon Scott's destructive lifestyle that ultimately took him away from us. And where would the world be had Bon survived? Certianly not on the levels of Highway To Hell. <br /> <br />    And where most bands are looking for their ultimate classic masterpiece (in the vein of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band) AC/DC found it here on 1979's Highway To Hell.
B000000OQF|5.0|I got this album for Chritmas, Christmas 2003.  Surprisingly enough, I'd never heard Welcome to the Jungle.  But now it's my 2nd favourite on this album, after Sweet Child o'Mine.  All the songs apart from tracks 8 ,5 and 11 are 5*.  Until I bought Iron Maiden, Number of the Beast (the album I bought after this), it was by far my favourite. <br /> <br /> <br />The best songs on this album are Welcome to the Jungle, Sweet Child o mine, Paradise City and Nightrain, in my view.  I have given a closer look at all the songs below. <br /> <br />1.  Welcome to the Jungle. 5*.  This song kicks off the album really well- with a slightly slow intro, then into real GNR style, energetic riff. <br /> <br />2.  It's so Easy. 5*.  I like this song.  Axl starts off by singing in a deep voice, most of the way, then he goes higher towards the end, accompanied by Slash's awesome guitar.  <br /> <br />3. Nightrain.5*  One of my all time Heavy Metal favourites.  This song is REALLY effective, and i love it.  A great load of guitar skills applied by the guitar master Slash. <br /> <br />4.  Out ta Get me.  5*.  I really like this song too.  Axl has some really strong vocals here, Slash has some great guitar playing.Duff, one of the worlds most underrated bassists, has some great bass here too. <br /> <br />5.  Mr Brownstone. 4*.  A bit of a disappointement compared with the rest of the album. <br /> <br />6.  Paradise City. 5*  This is INCREDIBLE.  My 3rd fav. on the album, this song has all the heavy metal charachteristics.  Its amazing. <br /> <br />7.  My Michelle. 5*. Starting off acoustically- then getting real heavy metal style.  THe hardest on the album.. Potentially the best, too. <br /> <br />8. Think about you. 3*  I shall say no more.  By far the poorest on the album.  I'd scratch the bottom of this CD badly to get rid of this song. <br /> <br />9.  Sweet Child o mine.  5*.  Far and Away my favourite GNR song.  It's incredible!  The least agressive on the album, this solo is my all time favourite.  Get it just for this. <br /> <br />10.  Your Crazy.  5*  On the whole a good song.  Possibly A BIT fast, otherwise, very good. <br /> <br />11. Anything goes 4*. The basics for a good song, possibly just not applied properly. <br /> <br />12.  Rocket Queen.  5* This one is an excellent album ender.  Leaving the listener on a high, the last part is extremely well done, well linked from the first part.  Some incredible guitar in this song.  Well worth 5*, and one of the greatest album enders ever. <br /> <br />Well- I've nothing more to say. If you want to enjoy an album, with energetic songs and no regrets, then get this now! <br /> <br />That's all I have to say.  Thankyou very much. <br /> <br />Matt. <br /> <br />
B00006GFAB|5.0|<br />When you went to a Kiss show you were excited from the moment the MC shouted, \\"You wanted the best, you got the best! The hottest band in the world...KISS!\\" all the way to the \\"Detroit Rock City\\" encore and this album is slightly like going to a Kiss show. It captures you immediately and doesn't let go until the end. <br /> <br />And I caught Kiss during the \\"crisis years\\" in Tampa during the Dynasty tour (1979). And I loved it. I appreciated Kiss and looked past the disco-flavor rumba. And even to this day I still can look past Dynasty as a piece of crap and see that it was Kiss trying to change with the times. It was sorry loss but Kiss revamped themselves and got back on track and are now the quitessential classic rock band. <br /> <br />And as far as quintessential rock bands go, I can deem this collection a necessity for anyone wanting in on this little thing we've got called Rock Legends!
B000002U82|5.0|Well... This is actually my Brother's album, however, I've listened to it a fair amount, and I have really come to like it.  Most of the songs get 5*.    1.  Breathe. 5*. This is a good, average p. Floyd song, although not their best.  read the lyrics.  They are amazing.  Yet depresing- all about death.  There is some great guitar on here- good rythmic rock, which is a charachteristic of Pink Floyd.    2. On the Run. 2*.  This could do with not being a separate track to itself.  It is effectively a link to 'Time', track 3- it should be part of this song, or part of breathe- although they are already linked.    3.  Time. 5*. Arguably my favourite Pink Floyd song ever, with an excellent, one-of-Gilmour's-best-guitar-solos.  Again, very depressing- yet stunning lyrics.    4.  Great Gig in the Sky. 5*.  This is an excellent song- heavy for Pink Floyd- just a woman screaming in tune (!).    5. Money. 5*.  One of my Pink Floyd favourite, this has another good guitar solo.  Sung by Dave Gilmour instead of Roger Waters, it is a good contrast between the two different voice styles.    6. Us and Them.  5*.  This one starts off a bit 'boring', but gets so much better as time goes on- into a good chorus, there are several of them.  Possibly the softest on the album, again, it gives good contrast against the rest of the songs.  Full Marks.    7. Any Colour you Like. 4*. A great example of instrumental music, and building up to a climax.  It changes style part way through, to make an excellent piece of guitar work.     8. Brain Damage. 5*.  I think this one is possibly my joint favourite on the album, along with Time.  The singing on this song is quite excellent.    9.  Total Eclipse. 4*.   Literally my favourite album ender I've ever heard.  It finishes as it begins.  Soft drumming makes a similar sound to a heartbeat.  At the beginning, 'Breathe' begins with a soft heartbeat, in my opinion signifying birth, and the way the heart starts beating in a development, up to a climax where the music bursts in.  At the end, the same drum beat is heard, yet fading away into nothingness, which i feel signifies death.  If you turn it up right at the end, a soft voice can be heard, saying \\"There is no Dark side of the Moon really- as a matter of fact it's all dark.\\"  It slowly beats away into silence, and that's where it ends.  A sinister, yet amazing album ending.    Just buy it.    You'll be pleasantly surprised if you think Pink Floyd is boring.    All the songs are linked together, which I feel resembles the continuity of life, until the heart stops beating.    Thank you very much.    Matt.
B00005NB0H|5.0|<br />I wrote a review of Live at Leeds in a music publication back in 1995 when the Cd was remastered and re-released and I stressed in that review the extras added into the release and praised the album for just that fact alone. <br /> <br />Fast-forward to 9 years later and I'm just absolutely compelled to write about this second re-release. With the bonus Tommy material performed live I am finally 100% satisfied. But I can't just review this CD with only that as the premise for what it's about. <br /> <br />Here you are actually getting The Who at their finest. I can even say this is one of the finest live albums, if not overall performances ever dropped onto vinyl and CD. And this in the midst of the essential releases, Tommy and Who's Next. With that, we are given one of the longest strings of perfect rock albums in any bands history - even the Beatles and The Stones. <br /> <br />From this we were blessed with excellent works by the Who in the form of Who's Next and then Quadrophenia. Four essential rock albums which converted the Who from slowly emerging as one of the best rock band to one of the absolute greatest rock bands. <br /> <br />So make the plunge and go out and buy Tommy, Live at Leeds, Quadrophenia and even By Numbers to obtain what is quite possibly some of the best collection of albums in rock history.
B000002H2H|5.0|Voted Metallica's greatest album, I'd say it is joint 1st with Master of Puppets.  There are 8 excellent tracks on here, all worth around 5*. <br /> <br />Here they are. <br /> <br />1. Fight Fire with Fire. 5*.  The first time I heard this song, I didn't really like it.  When I bought the CD, I prefered it considerably to the first time I heard it.  Arguably Metallica's fastest song, it has a very impressive riff, and a very impressive guitar solo.  Looking back, I now ponder at why I originally disliked it.  Full marks for this song. <br /> <br />2. Ride the Lightning. 5*.  The first time I heard this song was while I was listening to the CD for the first time.  Another very impressive starter riff, and intro to the guitar solo, where it slows down slightly, into a classic heavy metal style.  Then enters one of the greatest guitar solos I've ever heard- literally.  Another INCREDIBLE song. <br /> <br />3.  For Whom the Bell Tolls. 5*.  This song has an extremely good entry, lasting for about half the length of the total song.  I'm very impressed by James Hetfield's trademark vocals, in my view, as far as heavy metal goes, some of the best.  My one criticism of this song is that it has no real guitar solo.  A few subtle notes of the guitar come in at the end whilst the bell which started the song fades away, but overall i was disappointed at the lack of guitar solo. <br /> <br />4.  FAde to Black.  5*.  Apart from Master of Puppets and Sanitarium, this is my favourite Metallica song.  The trademark Metallica acoustic intro begins this song, until it breaks off into a cacophony of typical Metallica loudness which I REALLY like.  A great typical energetic Kirk Hammet solo finishes this song.  Yet another 5* rated song. <br /> <br />5. Trapped under Ice. 4*.  This song is not actually up to the same standard as the rest, but I still like it. <br /> <br />6.  Escape. 5*.  Back to another 5* rated song.  This is very impressive, I like the vocals in this song, althoughthe tune gets a bit 'dark' with James singing low with the accompaniment of the guitar, the bass and a funeral bell, like 'For whom the Bell tolls' <br /> <br />7.  Creeping Death. 5*.  This song's lyrics are to do with the bible verse to do with Moses, the Pharoah, and the plagues sent over Egypt.  The chorus of this song is very impressive, a typical Metallica chorus,  I really like it. <br /> <br />8.  The Call of Ktulu.  5*.  Although I feel this song is not as good as 'Orion', the instrumental song on Master of puppets, this song(instrumental I hasten to add), has extremely good playing, an amazing acoustic intro.  An amazing ending to an album, an excellent build up then decline to the acoustic intro again, this is followed by a strong blast of the electric guitar, adn the album ends.  This album has one of it's strong points against the 'Master of Puppets' Achilles' foot.  Master of Puppets has an extremely poor ending, as opposed to an incredible one, leaving the listener on a high. <br /> <br />So, that's it. <br /> <br />This album I'd recomend to every Metallica fan, right, back and centre. <br /> <br />JUST GET IT!!!!!
0671027344|5.0|The book \\"The Perks Of Bring A Wallflower\\" is an amazing book that shows you an inside look at the life of a wallflower.  This book shows an amazing perspective into the lives of high schoolers and what they deal with in their daily lives.<br /><br /> Through Charlie's letters you get a first hand look into his life and what he has to deal with.  Charlie's letters take you through his freshman year in high school and all of his experiences like the death of his only friend, making new friends, girls, drugs, and \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\".  Through Charlie's letters you can see him maturing with the help of his English teacher, which is more of a friend then a teacher and two seniors, Patrick and his sister Sam.<br /><br /> The Perks Of Being A Wallflower was a book that I hated to put down.  I think this book is great for kids in high school because they can relate to some of the things he experiences. I loved this book. Stephen Chbosky is amazing.
B00005M91K|4.0|There is no dialogue, other than incidental.  You will not be disappointed if you approach this movie as if it were your favorite album (CD) and you are going to sit down and listen to (watch) the whole thing.  It has some slow spots (depending on personal interests) but the imagery is awesome.  There are lots of Time-lapse segments that are nothing short of inspiring.  It can put things into perspective, from the sped up city scenes set to a hypnotizing musical set with people running around shuttling through a city maze, to chicks being shuttled through a hatchery, while their destiny lingers. I can certainly look to this movie again when I am in need of a change of mind.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Director Edgar Wright and co-scripter(and film's star) Simon Pegg so seamlessly blend the elements of horror and comedy that there is no easy way to categorize \\"Shaun of the Dead\\".  It is a laugh riot but the looming horror keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The film that I think comes closest as far as marrying these elements is \\"An American Werewolf in London\\" from 1981 but I think this film is more successful.  The films conceit is that prior to confronting real zombies, Shaun is in fact a zombie.  That point is obvious and it's not beaten into the ground.  It's not until Shaun has to do battle with the real McCoy that he breaks out of his funk.  Pegg is excellent in the title role, handling both the comic and action demands superbly.  Nick Frost as Ed, Shaun's best friend, is a hoot.  Not since John Belushi's Bluto in \\"Animal House\\" in 1978 has the screen seen such a memorably unapologetic slob.  I'd also like to note Bill Nighy as Shaun's stepfather, Philip.  He's good here and was the best thing in the otherwise turgid \\"Love Actually\\".  One final question.  How does Lucy Davis(\\"The Office\\"), who plays Diane, get that kind of tan living in England?
0060922583|5.0|Michael Talbot's \\"The Holographic Universe\\" is in a word fascinating. Before reading this book I read and reread \\"Seth Speaks\\" by Jane Roberts. Speaking through channeler Jane Roberts, Seth an entity no longer inhabiting planet Earth explains the \\"Nature of Reality\\". There are many common denominators between the two books. Most importantly perhaps is that mind creates reality not vice versa. Both books also talk about the realities underlying our existence and how time and space is but an illusion, and that we live many lives and prepare for each life before we are born. Seth Speaks is more of a text book in that he gives detail in \\"lessons\\" while Talbots book gives instances and anecdotal evidence. It being the new year I think I'll resolve (yet again) to seek from within the secrets withheld from our conscious mind. Caveat Emptor, be prepared to meet some personal demons along the way. We are too focused in this world. Any new forays into the unknown can be frightening. Imagine finding onesself in the midst of an OBE (out of body experience) and not knowing if you'll make it back. If you're one who can remember dreams this book may make you want to seek a deeper understanding of your dreams. I have taken many trips in my dreams but it would be nice if I could take such journeys consciously. The conscious mind, however, likes to be in control and fears losing it, at least to me. Anyway, it's a fascinating book. I suggest you read both Seth Speaks and The Holographic Universe.
B00005R2IS|5.0|I remember seeing \\"Mad Max\\" in the spring of 1980.  Now this was the days before multiplexes.  \\"Mad Max\\" was distributed by American International Pictures, Samuel Z. Arkoff's outfit whose forte was drive-in fare i.e. Grade B action and horror films.  I was seventeen at the time and the way this film was promoted was appealing to me.  The TV commercials were full of car chases and fast action.  When I saw the film naturally it was a real rush.  It didn't disappoint in the action department and the good guys were good and the bad guys were vile.  Something seemed a little off to me, though.  The landscape didn't look like anything that I was familiar with in America.  The speaking parts seemed a little off even though they were distinguishable American accents.  One of actresses in a minor role, Sheila Florence(May) was familiar to me from a popular Australian women's prison soap-opera from that time,\\"Prisoners of Cell-Block H\\". Never mind.  If this film was reviewed at all it was generally dismissed as exploitation trash.  I forgot about this film completely until I read a review of it in \\"Time\\" magazine, I think it was Richard Schickel, a couple months later extolling the virtues of this high-octane action thrill-ride.  The next I heard of Mel Gibson he was appearing in the highly praised \\"Gallipoli\\" this time speaking in an Australian accent.  Summer of 1982, \\"The Road Warrior\\"(or \\"Mad Max 2\\" as it was known overseas) was released to better box office and critical acceptance.  Home video was breaking at that time and both \\"Road Warrior\\" and it's lesser received original were released around the same time.  The legend continued to grow.  I watched \\"Mad Max\\" numerous times over the years and always enjoyed it but those bogus accents were always a detriment even as Mel Gibson's celebrity continued to grow.  I'd watch it and try to imagine what it should sound like by inserting in my mind Mel Gibson's actual voice instead of that lame dubbed voice.  Now,finally, we have the version that should have been available all along, \\"Mad Max\\" in all it's down-under glory.  For those who don't remember the original \\"American-version\\" of \\"Mad Max\\" don't even bother to seek it out.  I don't feel the least bit nostalgic for it.  This is the \\"Mad Max\\" that should have been available all along and we can leave the old \\"Max\\" to the garbage heap.

B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones loves ballads, as evidenced by the 14 short and sweet tracks united in Come Away With Me. Every song on this album works to her advantage. You can't help but swim in her soft vocal symphony and the simple sounds of piano, guitar and drums. The surprising addition of the accordion, organ and violin in two songs add a contrast to the jazz sound.<br /><br />This album embodies relaxed comfort. Norah controls all the vocals. No back up singers distract from her voice, she's that good. Obviously, since she won eight Grammy Awards in February. The fact that Norah's father is world famous sitar player Ravi Shanker hasn't helped or hindered her. Her sound is unmistakably her own and she demands her own audience.<br /><br />The opening track, Don't Know Why, won Jesse Harris a Grammy for song writing. He also wrote four other fabulous songs on this album and played acoustic and electric guitar. Harris has a new release out with Verve (Jesse Harris and the Ferdinandos). The sorrowful lyrics of Don't Know Why like \\"catching teardrops in my hand,\\" and \\"my heart is drenched in wine\\" are visually memorable when combined with Norah's vocal talent.<br /><br />Bass guitarist and songwriter Lee Alexander wrote four songs. Like Harris, Alexander's lyrics are short, simple and tell emotional stories that leave a lasting impression on the listener. They are talented storytellers.<br /><br />The title track, Come Away With Me, was written by Norah Jones and is a rich vocal dance with the piano. A true love song, this is pure romance from start to finish.<br /><br />Long Day Is Over is an impressive 33 words long. It surprised me how Norah and Jesse were able to turn 33 words into a smooth and beautiful salute to nightfall. The final track, The Nearness Of You, is a haunting duet between Norah and her piano.<br /><br />I keep mentioning the simplicity of this album. It is consistent throughout. This is definitely not a bad thing. When I say simple what I am referring to is the lack of bells and whistles. In a day and age that seeks to overexcite our every sense, Come Away With Me tickles the senses with the basics. It is real music for a society awestruck by reality everything.<br /><br />Norah Jones has had a sudden burst of fame and recognition but she is not a one-hit wonder who will disappear into the sunset once the media frenzy dies down. You can expect to see more releases as she spreads her wings. I wait patiently for the next flight. I totally recommend this one with all my senses.<br /><br />Review Originally Posted at [...]ng to is the lack of bells and whistles.

The lead girl singer had an amazing voice.  The guy's voice isn't as great....at all but gives it a rougher sound.  Overall i enjoyed it and look for more out of them
B000022TSW|5.0|Ok I absolutley LOVE this movie.  The first time I saw it was last year. It is hysterical but i agree with whoever wrote that it was too ani-christian.  I agree 100% that it is anti-christian. But it is the funniest movie i've seen so far and it is definatley not appropriate for kids.  I love Terrance and Phillips famous song (will not mention online) and I love that evryone curses becasue you're not really used to them saying it!  It's very funny and I think its a great movie
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I had a bit of skepticism going into watching this film because of all the praise it had received. Usually those types of movies don't live up to the hype after all. It is true that there are two types of comedy: those that rely more on slapstick humor, and those that are more of a deadpan kind of humor. This movie definitely is the latter, and based on which kind you find more appealing may determine whether this movie is for you. However, as far as being in a class all its own, Napoleon Dynamite definitely deserves that distinction, as it is one of the more refreshing comedies to come out in a long time. It does not rely on nudity, profanity or potty jokes to get its laughs; rather, it uses the oddities of its characters and their unlikely situations. <br /> <br /> Napoleon Dynamite, which was made by MTV, is a movie that chronicles the high school life of one geeky teenager (Napoleon), and uses odd characters and situations to gain much of the humor Some notable characters are Pedro (the new kid at school that Napoleon befriends, who eventually decides to run for class president), Napoleon's 32 year old brother Kip (who lives at home with Napoleon and chats online to women) and Uncle Rico (Napoleon's sleazy and macho uncle, who apparently is still living in the 80s).  Napoleon is the kind of guy that some may classify as being odd, weird, eccentric, unusual or maybe a little of all of those. His mangy orange hair and monotone voice seem to add to his unusual personality.  Both at school and at home he tends to get himself into unusual circumstances and predicaments.  <br /> <br />This is one movie that really didn't need a plot, mainly because its strength is its characters and their ridiculous situations. For instance, there is a segment where Kip talks Napoleon into going to a self-defense program called Rex Kwan Do that is hilarious. Rex is a loud, aggressive, obnoxious body builder type who wears a bandana with stars on it, yellow glasses, a polo shirt with his name on it, and work out pants that are red, white and blue. After Kip volunteers to be the guinea pig while Rex demonstrates his methods on him, Rex exclaims boldly to the class of listeners, \\"No more flying solo! You need someone watching your back at all times!\\" There is also a funny scene where Pedro runs for class president and Napoleon, who had been practicing dancing, does a solo dance for the class after Pedro's speech.  <br /> <br />Uncle Rico's character really stole the show in many respects. After Napoleon's grandmother leaves town for a few days, Uncle Rico comes to watch over Napoleon and his brother. Rico is obsessed with the idea of going back to 1982 so he could relive a high school football game and make the critical pass in a game.  He eventually gets Kip to buy a time travel machine online, which, of course, doesn't work. He also invites Kip into a little business endeavor where they are selling items door to door. Eventually Napoleon becomes angry because Uncle Rico is pestering everyone around him, even the girl at school who likes Napoleon, with his business. <br /> <br />Although the movie seems to be stuck in two different time periods, I thought the film was an original idea for a comedy. Far too often comedies have become formulaic and this is one movie that doesn't have a predictable mode to it. Normally these types of odd characters in a film only go so far (as we have seen with many of the Saturday Night Live skit based movies), but Napoleon Dynamite works well, and doesn't try too hard for laughs, which probably gives it more of an appeal. Overall I thought it was hilarious, and would recommend at least giving it a try.  <br />
B00005OM5L|5.0|Excellent selection of Tracks. Excellent Guitar play on this DVD. The DTS and PCM sound tracks are extremely good and are audiophile quality. This is a DVD that you can use to demonstrate your audio equipment.<br /><br />Cranck up the volume, select the DTS option and play track 1. Pure BLISS.<br /><br />I listen to this every once in a while.
B0000AZKLF|5.0|Imagine what it must be for anyone of us to have the honour and the proud of playing guitar with your childhood' s idol and even your youth. That blessing gift was in this time for Stevie Ray Vaughn when he recorded with this another monster legend of the blues guitar . May be Albert King never reached the status of B.B.King but without any doubt , he was a heartfelt , honest and sensitive musician .<br /><br />Listening Pride and Joy one of the most known Blues themes in the story , you feel touched immediately for this kind joyful conspiracy .<br /><br />Call it Stormy Monday was an inspiration of Aaron T. Walker , the pioneering electric blues guitarist from Oak Clift  is a moving piece .<br /><br />Ask me no questions is a clear device to show the abilities of the piano player : Tony Llorens . It is a funny and easy to follow theme filled with grace and fine irony .<br /><br />Blues at Sunrise is to me , the most impressive blues of the album with special homage to Janis Joplin and Jimmie Hendrix serving as introductory and brief speech and since it runs 15:10 the different curtains allow us to appreciate the undeniable virtues of this underground guitar player .<br /><br />Try to get that recording . It is a hidden jewel
B0002XDODU|5.0|I loved each song on this CD and it makes me want to get all there earllier albums.  I highly recommend this to all.
B00005JMYI|4.0|Alright first I'll start off by saying I went to see this movie on July 9th (opening day) and I laughed my [...] off.  I definitly think it's the funniest movie of the year.  With that said I was eagerly awaiting the Dvd release, and when I found about this new Unrated version, I was even more excited.  But when I got it and took it home and watched it, the unrated part fell flat.  It's a joke.  The reason it's unrated is because Burgundy says the f word fives times now instead of the 1 time in the orginal cut.  There's also a scene where he must eat cat poop.  The other few minimal new scenes don't add to the movie at all.  I think the unrated part was a joke to get higher sales.  There's no nudity in this version either, all though at the beginning of the movie it says there is.  Very weird.  Anyway, don't let this joke stop you from buying the funniest movie of the year.
B00013F38K|5.0|Amazing Series - 5 stars <br /> <br />To the poster below - Bruce Lee was 75% Chinese, his mother was 1/2 German.  You can tell, somewhat, by looking at him. <br /> <br />Not much else can be said about the Kung Fu series that hasn't been said below, however...  It's not about the acting as much as the importance of morality and the value of life.  If you're looking for an action flick, you will not find it here.  While there is some Martial Art, always in self-defense, the series focuses on philosophy and wisdom rather than how to knock the aggressor senseless. <br /> <br />If all you want is action, buy a Jackie Chan movie. <br />If you're in for the hope that you might gain some knowledge about what it means to be a Shaolin or a Kung Fu Master you will end up watching all 15-16 episodes in a single sitting. <br />
B0000844I8|5.0|Even at four years old, I knew this movie would be my favourite for years to come. <br /> <br />A film about a Colonel (Kurt Russell), hardened by the accidental suicide of his son, who accepts an apparently suicidal mission to another planet by use of a 'Doorway to Heaven'. The mission appears simple on paper. <br /> <br />Enter an academically unpopular Egyptologist (James Spader), who translates the coverstone of the gateway, which other scientists had mistranslated. 'Doorway to Heaven' becomes 'Stargate'. <br /> <br />The two, accompanied by a military team, travel through the Stargate to the planet Abydos, and meet the primitive natives (primitive because an evil alien who had taken the persona of Ra had supressed the Abydonian's academic evolution). <br /> <br />An hour and a half, a couple of deaths-then-revivals, a blossoming relationship and a turn-back from suicide later, the foe is defeated and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br />Personally, this movie is well worth the price of purchasing the special edition. Though the DVDs don't have much extras, the small booklet which comes with the set is full of information about the production and history of the Dean Devlin/Roland Emmerich partnership. <br /> <br />This movie rocks!
B00005NVT1|4.0|now i don't know about onyone else! but i happened to like the way they 'smashed' alot of their hits from the two earlier albums they produced!
B00062J00S|5.0|I've seen this movie a ZILLION times.  On TV, on tape and even in theaters, it always looked and sounded worn out with missing frames, scratches and pops and awful sound.  Watching this DVD was like seeing this movie for the first time!  The print is beautifully restored, NOT colorized, but in pristine Black and White.  The sound is crisp, clear, and they've even made the music sound amazingly less like the \\"tinny\\" sound you'd expect from a motion picture from it's time period.  I had my doubts when I read the \\"digitally THX Mastered\\" banner at the bottom of the DVD container....but they really did do a great job on restoring this Holiday classic.   If you love this movie, you won't be disappointed in this DVD.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I kept hearing great things about this movie from a coworker, so I decided to rent it and check it out. What a mistake this was. The movie has no plot, poor dialogue, made no sense at all, and had the worst soundtrack I have ever heard. Then again, what can you really expect from a movie from MTV. This was a huge waste of time and money, with which I could have purchased an empty box and been much more entertained.
B00000720W|5.0|the first thing that i would like to cover, this cd is NOT black metal, its more on the death metal side. i dont think that the band (at the time) was musically talented, the drums are comoplex and interesting, but especially the guitar lines, they are just very simple, its really easy to play along with the music on your guitar, the riffs are uncreative and just too simple. the production is kida raw, although thats not really a big turnoff to me. the vocals are very different than your usual death metal riffs, i like em, but i cant immaginge that anyone else would like them. it dosent sound like much time and effort was put into the album, but you know what? i absolutly love this album. its just the songs, no matter how much it appears that the band (at the time) has no talent, the songs are amaizing. they are really catchy. however this cd is only a ep, the only thing i dont really like about this albulm is that it is not really worth the price. this cd is also very different from mayhem's later works; however, i only like two cds by mayhem....this one and another one called De Mysteriis Dom Satans. DMDS is the greatest album i have ever heard, by that before you buy this.<br /><br />if you like this particualare album, then i recomend you try venom, burzum, darktrhone, possesed, and celtic frost.<br /><br />let me add that eronymous was not a great guitar player, he was average. hail varge\m/
B00006CXXU|1.0|How, I ask you, does this happen?? Yet another talentless drone who thinks she has singing capabilities just because she has a recording contract. How nasty this drone is... she is exactly (99.999999....%) like stupido Jennifer Lopez. Eeeeeewwwwww!!!! How sick is that??? And not to mention... if the fakeycakey targets a teenage audience, then why in the world would she sing tracks for movies in the child sensation Pokemen??? get a life!!!! Youre just as bad as SpearsCakes and THAT IS SAYING SOMETHING!!!!
B00005JMCN|5.0|I just had a few brief comments on this film.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film and was surprised at how good it was and how well it kept my interest, especially considering I don't know much about horse racing. I'm usually not too sentimental about films, but this one is truly a heartwarming story about a kindly, big-hearted tycoon who basically takes in three rejects and outcasts: the jockey (Toby McGuire), the old cowboy and horse-trainer (Chris Cooper), and Seabiscuit himself, and with his support and encouragement they overcome all odds to turn into a winning team and make Seabiscuit the most famous racehorse of all time. As Bridges says in one of his speeches to the press, \\"Our horse is too small, our jockey is too big, our trainer is too old, and I'm too dumb to know the difference,\\" (which gets a big laugh from the crowd).<br /><br />One of the most touching scenes in the movie is when the jockey and Seabiscuit, both recently injured and thought too seriously to ever return to racing, are both shown limping around the estate's grounds together on their long road back to recovery.<br /><br />Also, it's nice to see Ned Beatty is still working. He has a brief cameo as the doctor who advises Jeff Bridges that McGuire shouldn't try to ride since if his injured leg breaks again, he could be permanently crippled and never walk again.<br /><br />I read part of the book before seeing the movie, and there was one fascinating fact there I wanted to mention. The year Seabiscuit was winning all his races he had more mentions in the paper than the president himself--a truly amazing fact and another testamonial to how famous he became. The story of Seabiscuit captured the imagination of a depression-weary America with its tale of an unlikely underdog who eventually defeats the legendary War Admiral to become the champ.<br /><br />I also recall some years ago the Associated Press and ESPN did a 100 greatest athletes of the last century, and Seabiscuit was listed right along with Babe Ruth, Jesse Owens, Carl Lewis, Muhammed Ali, Sugar Ray Robinson, and other famous names.ewis, Muhammed Ali, Sugar Ray Robinson, and other famous names.
B000069AUI|5.0|I first heard of coldplay in a car commercial and it stuck with me for 2 years! I just recently discovered who sang it and, not hearing any of there other songs bought it. It is my favorite cd in my collection! The songs have a deep meanings and i love the guitar. Its so refreshing to get away from a lot of the pop that is out there. I highly recomend it!
0440234743|4.0|I recently started reading John Grisham again, and I'm enjoying his novels.  This one combines an interesting plot about a billionaire's will with the exotic setting of Brazil's Pantanal region.  Like all of Grisham's books, it reads fast and the characters are flawed but endearing.
B000065V41|5.0|The Muppet Christmas Carol has been a classic in my household as long as I can remember. Every year at Christmas my family would pull this movie out and watch it.  <br /> <br />The Muppet Christmas Carol combines Muppets with humans in a style only a Henson could do. It has humor, a story, moral, and loveable characters that last a lifetime.  <br /> <br />Michael Cain is the gruff old miser Ebenezer Scrooge. He plays this character masterfully, sending chills into any room. Gonzo the Great (David Goelz) plays Charles Dickens. He and Rizzo (Steve Whitmire) follow Ebenezer Scrooge as he encounters the three spirits. <br /> <br />I would recommend this movie to anyone, but for the Muppet lover this is a must watch.
0517201658|5.0|The Thorn Birds is up there with Gone With the Wind on my list of favorite epics.  I love the setting of rural Australia, I love the characters, I love the tragedy.  After you read the book, watch the classic miniseries with Richard Chamberlin!
B00004XOWM|1.0|IMO, this album is melding of rap and rock with Fred Durst's insufferably obnoxious vocals, his often downright stupid lyrics and his personality.  <br /> <br />About five of the songs on this album are either lethargic and boring tracks where Fred tries his obnoxious \\"singing\\". One and My Way have enough decent melody or energy to be at least mediocre. Boiler, It'll be OK and Hold On are the bad ones. <br /> <br />The first half of the album is made up of high energy rap rock with the Limp Bizkit sound and structure (intro, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge/quiet section, climax/chorus). The energy is there with Wes Borland's unremarkable guitar and Fred's trademark rap/whine and shouted choruses. Unfortunately, the annoying macho attitude of the lyrics and Fred's voice are annoying. Plus, I don't like rap much anyways. They go from decent (Take A Look Around) to mediocre(Livin it up, My Generation, Full Nelson) to incredibly stupid(Hot Dog, Rollin). Also, what's with the excessive profanity. It is one thing to swear to express anger, it gets tiresome when you have scores of F words for the sake of having scores of F words (\\"That makes 46 F***s in this F***ed up song\\"). <br /> <br />There are also 2 straight rap songs. They are Rollin(Urban Assault Vehicle) and Getcha Groove On. Limp Bizkit brings some rappers like Redman, Method man and DMX onboard for these tunes. As I don't like rap, there's not much I can say for these songs. <br /> <br />If you like this album, it's perfectly fine. It so happens I don't, so i'm reviewing it negatively. And I have listened to it. I would reccommend RATM for some better rap rock with meaning and better musicianship. But if you like you rock with a good deal of rap, you probably would like this..
B0002XVQNU|4.0|You know, Superman ain't that brave - short of kryptonite knuckledusters, the average criminal can't hurt him at all. And Batman, at least on the big screen, is wearing bullet-proof armour - that shows a certain level of \\"caution\\". What does it take to be \\"The man who knows no fear\\"? I'll take complete invulnerability, thanks. Some super-strength would be nice, too. No? I don't get any of that? <br /> <br />Daredevil, the man who knows no fear, isn't invulnerable, isn't bullet-proof, and isn't super-strong. He's blind. I'm not kidding - he lost his sight as a child in an accident. Admittedly, his other senses were heightened to a remarkable level - his hearing, in particular, is extremely acute. So acute, that a resonant sound will bounce off things and give him a radar-like image of his surroundings (I gotta say, even though the movie and the comics talk about radar sense, it is actually SONAR, as used by submarines - would it have been so hard for them to get that right?). The catch is that he has to sleep in an isolation tank, because all the sound in New York keeps him awake. <br /> <br />Daredevil, like every good superhero, has a secret identity - his is Matt Murdock. Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) is a lawyer who will never make the big time because he insists on working for the innocent, and prosecuting the guilty, much to the despair of his long-time partner, Franklin \\"Foggy\\" Nelson (Jon Favreau). Matt is a man for the ladies, and he's not above using his blindness as a ploy to pick them up. It doesn't work with the latest gorgeous, but mysterious, woman (Jennifer Garner, who looks really good with green eyes) - she brushes him off. When he follows her, she gets physical, and is astonished that he can fend off her attack. Their sparring gets more serious and becomes a form of foreplay - this is one of the sexiest fight scenes you'll see, as well as being an impressive use of playground equipment. (The extras show how it was Affleck and Garner doing all the wirework for this sequence - quite impressive).  <br /> <br />For an action movie like this we need a villain, or two, and we have them in Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) and Bullseye (Colin Farrell). Both are absolutely fabulous in their roles. <br /> <br />This is a dark movie, much darker than Superman, and even darker than Batman. And that's right, because Daredevil isn't a light-hearted character, fighting for truth, justice, et cetera. He's a vigilante, seeking revenge more than justice, revenge on a world that killed his father. His is not the shiny world of Metropolis, or even Gotham City supported by the Wayne Foundation; he lives in Hell's Kitchen New York, the ghetto. He doesn't dress as an angel, come with heavenly justice - he dresses as a devil, come to punish the wicked. <br /> <br />I have never read the Daredevil comic books, so I was surprised when I saw this film. It's a very cool movie, and they've done a superb job of it (and they are proud of it - check the extras). Strongly recommended, especially if you thought Batman wasn't dark enough.  <br />
B00004Z459|2.0|Hybrid Theory is catchy, to the point and accessible. It is no surprise that it was such a big hit with the general public. The album mixes a little techno with rap rock and pop melodies.  <br /> <br /> The DJ often lays down much of the beat with the drummer playing simple bass drum/snare rhythms. The electric guitar is rather simple, playing riffs that range from mediocre to catchy at times(One step closer). The bass follows the guitar. All the instruments basically take a back seat to the vocals of rapper Mike Shinoda and the rough/screechy singing of Chester Bennington. The rap is OK but the melodies are not bad. However, they are quite poppish. <br /> <br />The problem with this album is that the songs are repetitive. But it isn't the same 12 songs over and over again like on Meteora. Some songs are a bad as it is onlittle different from the others. However, the quality varies unlike on Meteora(where most of the songs are OK but not great). Points of Authority, Pushing Me Away, and Runaway are all decent but somewhat forgettable. The other songs are mostly unremarkable to just bad. In the End, One Step Closer and Crawling are overplayed and annoying. There are no truly horrendous tracks on this album, but there aren't any classics here IMO. I got bored of this fast. Overall, this album is catchy and commerical but unfulfilling.
B0001WTWCO|5.0|I'm one of the people who was completely taken with THE ENGLISH PATIENT when I saw it in theatres, but was also amused when Elaine Benis on \\"Seinfeld\\" goofed on it later.  Or, should I say, goofed on everyone who loved it.<br /><br />The non-linear story structure, the superb acting, the gorgeous photography, the unfolding mystery of what happened to the doomed couple--all of it hit me just right.  While other people complained at the film's slow pace, I was soaking up the period details and authentic locations.  I played the soundtrack CD for months afterward (and still do sometimes), finding myself lost in the distant and sometimes-haunting music.<br /><br />There were so many terrible movies in the 1990s, just mere product crafted by committee and focus groups, that the intimate--though tragic--feel of this story felt very personal and real.<br /><br />You know the couple played by Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas are in BIG trouble from the moment they meet.  Just watch their eyes and expressions.  Allowing a passion to spread like that has major implications on everyone around them and, in this case, also has major implicactions on a world on the brink of war.<br /><br />(One footnote: the church I attend put out a list of Top Ten Reasons to Boycott Disney shortly after the film came out.  Perhaps scraping for a reason to fill out the list, number 10 was \\"Boycott Disney because it funds Miramax, which produced THE ENGLISH PATIENT, a film that glorifies adultery.\\"  Huh?  How anyone can watch this film and believe that these characters, tormented by guilt and confusion, indulging in a passion that not only kills them all but also contributes to Nazi victories in Africa, completely escapes me.)
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I found this gem while browsing in Virgin. I was busy listening to another CD through the headsets when the DJ played a few tracks 'over the air'. I got hooked on track 2 - Don't wait too long.  <br /> <br />Peyroux's smoky vocals and phrasing are classic. This is one of the few Jazz album's that is accessible on first hearing and then grow to love after a few hearings. Great background music and there's very few things better than to put it on, grab a good book and take some time for yourself. <br /> <br />If you're thinking about buying , focus on track's 2 (Don't wait too long) and 4 (You're gonna make me lonesome - a Bob Dylan cover). The phrasing and lilt to her voice on track 4 is worth the money on it's own.
0062502174|2.0|this book is just too simple.  i can't get into all the detail that other reviewers, because it was done well already. i find it interesting that the woman's dream was just to have a man delivered to her from the desert, and she knew it her role to wait for him to find his dream and support him with that.  since, of course, her dream was already fulfilled by him.
B00066VUPM|4.0|I have been a huge Travis fan since their early days, and they have only gotten better with age. Four albums into their career, \\"Singles\\" takes stock of all of their singles that range from humble beginning tracks to arena-filling anthems. This works better as an introduction to those new to the band, and depending on your level of fanfare, the two new songs make it worth a purchase for the diehards.<br /><br />The tracks are basically divisible by the albums. The tracks from \\"Good Feeling\\", their debut, are more Britpop infused, with standout tracks such as \\"U16 Girls\\", \\"All I Wanna Do Is Rock\\", and \\"More Than Us\\". The songs from \\"The Man Who\\" are definitely more polished, and it is easy to see why they hit is big with this album. There are few bands who can produce songs like \\"Driftwood\\", \\"Turn\\" and \\"Writing to Reach You\\" on the same record. The tracks from \\"The Invisible Band\\" take the sound to the next level, with more stadium-rocking tracks like \\"Sing\\", \\"Side\\" and the country-infused \\"Flowers in the Window\\" (perhaps my least favorite of the tracks). This is my favorite Travis album, as it is the most consistent. Next we have tracks from the fan favored but critically underrated \\"12 Memories\\", which is their weakest album, but one that packed more than a few great songs. Included here is the hit single \\"Re-Offender\\" (one of their best songs), \\"Love Will Come Through\\" and the politically-charged \\"The Beautiful Occupation\\". The highlights of each album are here, and it makes for a nice, comprehensive overview of their work so far.<br /><br />Being a singles collection, there are loads of good songs that are not included here. Missing are some of my favorite Travis songs like \\"As You Are\\", \\"Last Train\\", \\"Happy to Hang Around\\", and \\"Peace the F*** Out\\". But this is to be expected, as there is a sharp difference between a \\"Best of\\" package and a \\"Singles\\" compilation. Many good songs are overlooked. But what I am happy about is the inclusion of \\"Coming Around\\", which was a one-off single released between \\"The Man Who\\" and \\"The Invisible Band\\". The new song, \\"Walking in the Sun\\", is a good tune in the typical Travis style, but I wouldn't buy this compilation on the strength of that song alone.<br /><br />Overall, you can't go wrong with a Travis CD. They have had many great songs and I hope that they have many more to come. For someone new to the band, this is the best place to start. The fans probably have all the albums, so this compilation is not an essential purchase.hich was a one-off single released between \\"The Man Who\\" and \\"The Invisible Band\\".

B00005JMJ4|3.0|Interesting movie to a certain extent but gets old after the first hour and then it becomes extremely long and boring, i can only take so much japanese culture. Its loaded with exquisite images of the city , the life and the culture of the Japanese. About 2 strangers played by bill murray and scarlet johansan who find eachother in Japan while staying at a hotel. HO HUM. I was more interested in the japanese people than the characters bill and scarlet played. I recomend Virgin Suicides ( also directed by Sophia Coppola) over this. 3 Stars.

B000001F76|5.0|Hank Williams was the greatest and most important country singer of all time.  This set offers 40 songs that prove that fact.  Every single song here is a bona fide classic. Hank was a superlative songwriter as well as a great singer.  He wrote in two basic styles.  There were the lighthearted songs, like \\"Mind Your Own Business\\" and \\"Howlin' at the Moon\\", which took a humorous look at some often serious subjects.  And then there were the serious songs, like \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\" and \\"My Son Calls Another Man Daddy\\", that are among the saddest songs ever written.  I could go on and on about how great Old Hank was, but I think I'll stop now.  Highly Recommended.
0312330529|5.0|I read about 100 books each year, mostly historical fiction.  Shantaram is up there with the best I have ever read.  It takes an amazing author to sustain my interest for 900 pages.  Roberts did it easily.  Once I got to page 600 I dreaded the impending ending because I knew that anything else I read next would pale by comparison.  While I have no desire to go to India Roberts took me there and let me smell, feel and touch the sub-continent.  This is a must read.
B000002GHH|5.0|The rest of the album is fine, good, entertaining (\\"Memphis in the Meantime\\"), lovely (\\"Lipstick Sunset\\"). <br /> <br />But \\"Have a Little Faith in Me\\" is one of my two or three favorite cuts by anyone, ever, period. <br /> <br />Wny?  Two things.  First, there's the combination of Hiatt's rhythmic, measured, controlled solo piano with his emotional, sandpapery, soul- and gospel-flavored pleading vocal.   <br /> <br />But second, and more importantly, there's a big emotional wallop in what I see as the ambiguity of the lyrics.  This is on its face a romantic song -- a man pleading to someone (addressed only once, as \\"girl\\") to have faith in him.  But change that one word, and listen to the lyric thinking of the singer as God addressing someone.  It works, totally. <br /> <br />However you want to imagine the singer, this cut is deeply satisfying.
0375713751|2.0|There are some very, very funny moments in this book.  However, as this book continued, this character rang false for me, which detracted substantially from the humor.  Kate is a caricatured composite of a \\"career woman\\" combined with a grab-bag of anecdotes about what can go wrong when one tries to combine family life with a high-powered career.  It is as if a group of women sat around swapping clever quotes, jokes and horror stories about career moms, then tacked them all rather awkwardly into this story.   <br /> <br />At the beginning I was willing to go with it as a story about the \\"days where everything goes horribly wrong\\".  But this character consistently makes choices that do not make any sense in the real world, which, as far as I can tell, is just meant to make the plot spin more and more out of control.  Since I don't know any mom who would make the bizarre, nonsensical choices this character continuously makes, after a while this just read like a somewhat mean-spirited cautionary fable, meant to convince women not to try to \\"have it all\\".  Why is hubby sitting around while mom (who is out of town much more often) acts as gatekeeper, insisting that she controls the nanny, the shopping and the other domestic organization?  Why is she so concerned about what the stay at home moms will think about her school bake-sale contribution, while caring so little about the actual mental and physical well-being of her kids?  Why is she still acting like a single career gal who hasn't had to rethink her entire priority list, organizational plan and way of living?   <br /> <br />For all of the real women I know who combine a career with motherhood (and for their spouses), pregnancy and having a first child meant a radical rethinking of how life worked--it meant bending a lot of the rules so that the system didn't break.  I have a 5 and 2 year old...and a highly demanding career I love in a tough, male dominated field.  It is wonderful and workable.  While occasionallythings will spin out of control, it seems completely non-sensical that anyone would just continue to unthinkingly and miserably rush through an unsustainable lifestyle that is no fun on either end, no good for the kids, the spouse or herself, without doing a lot of hard thinking about how to better balance things to make life workable.  <br /> <br />Supposedly this woman has a 5 and 1 year old, so she's certainly had plenty of time for such a rethinking.  Eventually, this strained Kate's credibility beyond my ability to enjoy her tale or relate to her.  As far as I can tell, the answer to the questions I've just posed is that it is all just a plot device:  in the end, (SPOILER ALERT!) the whole life-spinning-out-of-control does just break down, Kate gives up her high profile career, and she discovers she is so much happier.  What a shame that Kate is still basically the same person at the end as the beginning...no more self-awareness, no more ability to do things based on her own sense of self and priorities, and to shelve the guilt and need to meet other people's diverse expectations about who she is.  What a pointless exercise and wasted opportunity...
B0006213WG|3.0|Being a huge Sum fan, I eagerly anticipated Chuck. But I have to admit, I'm disapointed. I wasn't expecting this at all. Most of the songs just aren't Sum 41. They're trying too hard to be something they're not. I love Sum 41 because of their catchy pop punk goodness. They've ditched that on the majority of the tracks and instead opted for some Nickelback/Linkin Park/Iron Maiden sound. Don't get me wrong, some of the tracks are good. No Reason and Welcome To Hell are great. But the rest aren't up to par. Bottom line is, if you're new to Sum 41, pick up Does This Look Infected or All Killer No Filler. And hope their followup to Chuck isn't much more of a disaster. Sum 41 should just go back to what they do best, instead of trying to become some serious emo type rock band. It may be the new fad but it doesn't mean its any good. I have nothing against bands changing their sound. I just have a problem with it when they change their sound and I know they can do better. <br /> <br />

Renee's Bridget is \\"Every Women\\" - and I can certainly relate to her.<br /><br />Colin Firth is amazingly sexy and handsome in this movie. He was the best thing in the move. Every Woman's Dream man.<br /><br />I loved the sequel, and I hope they continue making more.
B0002EXH40|4.0|Youthanasia is a guilty pleasure of mine.  It is one of Megadeth's most commercial-sounding albums - and is one of my favorites.  With this sixth album, it is obvious that Dave Mustaine wanted to \\"open up\\" Megadeth to new audiences (or markets), and usually I have a problem with that.  Not on this occasion.<br /><br />Youthanasia has some strong pop elements weaving in and out of this album.  We see strong evidence of this in the very catchy choruses of \\"Stream of Consequences\\", \\"Addicted to Chaos\\", \\"Elysian Fields\\", and \\"Victory\\".  I sometimes find myself actually playing these songs while washing my car (you can't really do that with the likes of Exodus or Testament).  Also, Mustaine and crew stray away from the hard, thrash-roots sound of \\"Killing is my Business...\\" or \\"Peace Sells...\\" and opt for a more radio friendly brand of heavy metal.  There are some elements of blues-influenced forms and riffs throughout (even a few harmonica appearances!).  A word of warning - there are no really fast-tempo numbers on this album.  Gone are the days of Peace Sells-esque thrasher cuts like \\"Devil's Island\\" or \\"Black Friday\\".<br /><br />The lyrical content is also more mature and serious.  No more anthems to insanity, nuclear war, axe murderers, or satanism.  These songs address more, shall we say, relevant issues like dealing with mortality, fighting drug addiction, learning from mistakes, and child abuse.<br /><br />If you're worried about musicianship, don't be.  Mustaine and Marty Friedman still take turns shredding on every song.  David Ellefson still faithfully thumps away terrific lines on bass, and drummer Nick Menza pounds out some dizzying rhythms.<br /><br />My choice cuts are \\"Train of Consequences\\", \\"Addicted to Chaos\\", \\"Elysian Fields\\", and \\"Family Tree\\".  Overall, Youthanasia is a gem.  Yes, it is different and it does stray from the formula, but it is nicely done.  If anything, this offering proves Megadeth's versatility and willingness to open up and explore.<br /><br />PS.  If you didn't like this album, then DO NOT get \\"Risk\\".<br /><br />PPS.  Megadeth's latest album, \\"The System Has Failed\\", is excellent.idn't like this album, then DO NOT get \\"Risk\\".    PPS.  Megadeth's latest album, \\"The System Has Failed\\", is excellent.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|Don't look at the star rating on this review thinking that I disliked this film.  On the contrary I found this film to be one of the best films (animated or otherwise) I've ever seen.  However, the DVD of the film was clearly rushed.  I wouldn't watch the english dub, but for an american anime release the lack of one is strange.  But the lack of english dub isn't the main issue, the subtitle production for the film is atrocious.   <br /> <br />Unlike other anime movies (or any other movie, foreign language or not) the only subtitles offered are subtitles for the hearing impaired.  That's it.  If the movie were a movie in the english language this might be excusable however seeing as this is a Japanese movie, the lack of any other subtitle options is just a horribly lazy and stupid decision on Dreamwork's part. <br /> <br />And for a comical note, it seems to me it would be a bad sub for the english impaired anyway, as many of the prominant sounds are left out of the subtitles anyway. <br /> <br />The bottom line is, if you have any respect for the film at all, don't buy this DVD version of the film and if you're an anime nerd like me, hope that Dreamworks recieves enough hate mail that they release an alternate version of the film with proper subtitles included.
B000022TSV|5.0|This film version of Carmen is outstanding.  It was shot in Seville, and captures the lifestyle of the peasants perfectly.  Carmenita compensates for her low social status with her beauty and her skill of manipulating men.    I usually prefer stage performances, but film has its own advantages that makes this opera beautiful, such as the stampede of horses running freely, and the peasant children chasing the bullfghter.     Watch this immediately!
B0006A9FKA|4.0|I tried to see this film twice in theaters, and failed both times. The first time was because the theater that was supposed to be playing abruptly changed their schedule and didn't notify the papers. The second time was because I had brought a pretty girl with me (Hormones and whatnot, you understand), and, since she was only 16, they would not let us in. It was the only time I'd EVER been carded (I've been able to pass for a man in his thirties since I was 17), and we couldn't see it. I was in pain, which only increased when she decided we should see THE GRUDGE instead. <br /> <br />Luckily, this movie proved to be worth all the trouble and wait. It's hilarious and horrifying, often at the same time. Shaun and Ed are two very believable slackers who I'd very much like to hang out with. And they handle the situation pretty much like every other slacker I know would: Badly. But they more or less get through it.  <br /> <br />Mind you, this movie does seem to shift attitudes a lot. One second it's goofy comedy, the next it's suspense, the next it's flat out gory horror. It may get on some people's nerves. It didn't mine, so I ended up loving the flick. This would make an excellent double feature with the new DAWN OF THE DEAD. You can compare the filmmaker's attitudes toward the whole zombie genre. Personally, I think this one's better, as I've never really liked the new 'Fast Zombie' fad currently in horror movies. <br /> <br />Buy this movie. Even if you're one of the folks who don't typically like British Comedy, I think it'll pleasantly surprise you.

B000002U9P|4.0|I remembered when this album came out in 1986.  I liked Typical Male, where Tina tried to go for the dance sound that Janet Jackson did on her Control album.  The rest of the album has a rockier feel, especially on What You Get, Break Every Rule and some other cuts.  While I like Two People, it sounds like both What's Love Got To Do With It and We Don't Need Another Hero, especially on the bridge leading to the final chorus section of the song.  I find myself singing both What's Love and Hero at that part.  Tina must have been so blown away after Private Dancer's multiplatinum success that she wanted another song like that on this one.  Maybe she didn't know that when she recorded this song.  But Break Every Rule was another solid post-Private period effort from her.

B000001EXB|5.0|I picked up this album at the midnight release of the \\"Candle In The Wind '97\\" single. It wasn't supposed to be released until the following morning, but I got extremely lucky in asking what was playing while the cash register went down and asking if I could purchase it then. <br /> <br />I am quite firmly convinced that it's the best random purchase I have ever made. The only song that hits me wrong in the general feel of the album is \\"I Can't Steer My Heart Clear Of You\\", and even that song communicates a depth of feeling that allows me to ignore the break.  <br /> <br />The best song? \\"The End Will Come\\", hands down. Followed closely by \\"Love's Got A Lot To Answer For\\", \\"If The River Can Bend\\", and \\"Wicked Dreams\\".  <br /> <br />My ex-husband introduced me to Elton John's music. Normally, this would turn me off an artist simply because of the memories. Instead, I became a fan. This album has gotten me through a lot of hard times, and I don't think I'll ever stop listening to it regularly. It's been a regular on my playlist since it's release.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Metallicas black album, Pink Floyd the wall, and now Rammsteins Mutter. One of the best cds ever put togther. Hands down. Just by it and you shall see.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I cannot believe it...I wasn't much of a green day fan ok...I have ilsten to their old stuff, and I didn't like the Warning cd, but man, this American Idiot cd is just awesome. <br /> <br />They weren't kidding when they say its a Rock opera cd.  Every song is good. I don't skip over any song.  This band has potential, and it shines in this cd. Do not be fooled. Definitely get this.
B00021TL20|3.0|It always seems to be a very well case when a artist does very well and captures the 80's, but just doesn't recapture that triumph. That has happened to so many acts including Michael Jackson, Sting, Rick Springfield, and one of the most legendary artists of the era, Phil Collins. During that era, he achieved a double dose of extraordinary wonders in the music industry, with his solo status, and his time as the lead for Genesis. Yet, with all that time, his solo efforts really broke so much ground all over the world. During that time, he made so many great songs, but for a good collection of his music may seem like another story.<br /><br />Phil Collins Platinum Collection is a collection that consists of three of Phil's well recieved studio albums of the 80's: his solo debut, the Grammy-winning Album Of The Year No Jacket Required, and his 1989 album But Seriously. The albums each include a lot of great pop songs including One More Night, the infectious Sussudio, Phil's groundbreaking debut song, In The Air Tonight, Another Day In Paradise, and many others. The collection fairs well for some, while others might feel that it really is a waste of the dollar. The albums are great, but could've been remastered a little better. Another downside is that the collection overlooks a lot of good songs including You Can't Hurry Love, Against All Odds, Two Hearts, and Seperate Lives.<br /><br />All in all, Phil Collins Platinum collecton is good for anybody who doesn't have all 3 of these respective albums, but for anybody who has one of these records, this collection might not be worth buying... seriously!!<br /><br />Face Value: C<br /><br />No Jacket Required: B<br /><br />But Seriously: B+<br /><br />Price: C<br /><br />Remastering: C<br /><br />Overall: C+
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Personally i don't care what people think of Fiona as a person.  I have literally thousands of CD's and \\"When The Pawn\\" is the best lyrical CD i've ever heard.  Theres nothing i've ever heard lyrically that even comes close to this CD.  Not much else i can say other than if your thinking of buying it please do.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|ok well i bought this the other day at amazon and did 1 day shipping and well I was so excited to watch this! I put it in my playstation 2 for watching pleasure and then i go to setup and then to audio and what do I find!? No options for english voice acting! Why would they do this when the first film and the show has english voices!? When I found this out I turned off my ps2 and put the dvd back in the case. I will probably never watch this movie unless they have a remake dvd where there is english voices. Sorry i ain't into subtitles at all and also people said the subtitles are done horrible too. So anyway i'm really enjoying the show but I will not watch the 2nd movie and really review it until there is a rerelease of the movie with english voices. so anyway 2 the people that was thinking of buying this and didn't buy it yet DON'T! They may rerelease wit a english voices.  <br /> <br /> <br />again i know I shouldn't give this review a 1 because the movie really probably deserves a 5 but the dvd is horrible!  <br />aight so 1
B000001GGV|5.0|I really think Pogorelich provides a definitive interpretation to the Scarlatti Sonatas. I have talked to many people about this, and as a concert pianist I can say that he plays the pieces a little fast, however that is the way Scarlatti intended most of them. He has a very crisp, light touch which really make the colour of Scarlatti come alive.
1881273628|5.0|Mr. Chapman speaks the truth in the most easily understood and entertaining manner. Everyone needs to read this to relate better to your significant other. I would especially recommend this as a wedding gift. For days, weeks, or years after marriage, the perpetual love will seem to die, but it is merely transformed and knowing this will prevent divorce. No facades in this book. Mr. Chapman tells it like it is and gives mini homework assignments in each area to improve your ability to speak your spouses' love language.
0671004107|3.0|In the year 1999, one astronomer makes a discovery that would shake the very foundations of the world. Eleanor Arroway, a graduate of Harvard and California Technological University and a native of Wisconsin, would make such a discovery. Working in a radio telescope compound known as Argus, she searches the sky constantly, in hopes of receiving a message from a distant civilization. Dedicated to her work, she finally makes progress when one of her telescopes receives an overwhelmingly strong signal from a star named Vega. Looking at the screen of 1's and 0's, she discovers that it is a video clip of Adolf Hitler welcoming the world to the 1936 Olympics! After further studying this awkward transmission, she discovers that there is a message underneath the video clip. Quickly, the rest of the world joins in the effort to collect this message and hopefully decipher it. As the message continues, members of the Soviet Union make the discovery that the message may be a blueprint for the construction of a machine. This novel follows the life of Ellie Arroway during this fictional period of discovery. Playing a vital role in the construction of the Machine, she also becomes the representative of the United States to the alien race that sent them the Message. She always believed that there were other intelligent beings in the universe, and for the first time, she has her proof.     I enjoyed this book. It was full of exciting \\"what-ifs.\\" Also, Carl Sagan did an excellent job with the character of Ellie, who was both extremely smart and very much human, unlike other genius characters in other stories that seem to be above everyone else. He gave all the characters deep emotions and backgrounds that kept me interested in the book. I would not recommend this book to those who cannot stand reading anything that isn't full of action. Though there are some exciting points in the book, I would not say it was full of action. Also, the language used in the book was highly scientific, and with my \\"junior in chemistry class\\" understanding of science, I could barley understand it. I did, however, have some idea of what was going on at all times. In short, I recommend this book for the open minded and the scientific, otherwise, I suggest staying away from it until you figure out what isomers, harmonic oscillators, and erbium dowels are.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I watched this film because someone I barely know saw it and told me that it's her favorite movie of all time.  Whenever someone says anything is their absolute favorite anything, it's usually something that should be looked into.  So I rented the dvd and now of course I own it because this IS a great movie.    What I mostly like about Eternal Sunshine is that it's not so idealistic like all the other movies out there.  Most films end when the relationshp in question is just beginning, but this one actually shows you the ups, downs, and in-betweens.  I think that's really important.  So many people today who are trying to meet someone think that everything is supposed to end up like it does in almost every movie you see.  That happily ever after crap is thrown out the window in this film.      The camera work, effects, and music are all really well-done, too.  I like that it's a little weird and complicated.  It's one of those that you really have to see multiple times to truly appreciate.  As for the acting, I think Jim Carey did the best job of anyone.  He nailed that mopey, slightly boring character.  I kept thinking that Kate Winslet's character could have been portrayed better by someone like Winona Ryder.  Maybe that's just because Winslet seems so proper with all those period films she's been in and all.    I'd recommend Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind to anyone, except maybe people who like happily ever after chick flicks and don't like things they can't fully understand right away.
055321263X|4.0|I have just read this book for my A level English Literature course and found it absolutely thrilling. The story weaves together so well and leaves you guessing for so much more. If anyone could help I'd like to know how people think the protagonist overcomes adversity in this book. Thanks!
B00018D44U|2.0|I, like so many millions loved the first Norah Jones album.I anxiously awaited the follow-up, hopeing for a repeat of such a great package of songs. I was sadly disappointed. The first had no weak or throw away songs, the second seemed to be the left overs not good enough for that debut. I strained to find something that was likeable and easy on my ears. Memorable songs that made me feel good. This album seemed to be either rushed to cash in or simply uninspired.I continue to listen to the first and have filed away the second as a bad investment. Her mamagement could learn a few things from that of Tierney Allen, the silken voiced jazz and standard singer who has yet to come into her own with a major following.Ms. Allen's music always is up lifting and easy to listen to on \\"repeat\\" on my CD player. Not so with Ms. Jones second time out.

B000002UAF|5.0|That I am a 25 year old dominican chic that loves early beatles.  I always tell people that if I had grown up in the 60's I would've fainted left and right from beatle mania and I would've most likely stalked paul mc cartney...  They were all so cute in the early 60's....  sigh....  Anyway, all of this is besides the point.  I LOVE this album, as corny as people may think it is.  My fave songs are I should've known better, if I fell, just to dance with you, and I love her. I honestly know ALL OF THE LYRICS to all of the songs in this album.  I swear.  Anyway, just buy it.  C'mon, it's the beatles for christ's sake!
B00031TXBI|5.0|This is probably the most Funky, Grungy, Distorted album that John has made so far.   It's my favorite of all his albums because of this.   Omar Rodriguez from The Mars Volta makes a guest appearance on the track 666.   Josh Klinghoffer does a good job playing most of the bass tracks and all drums.   Best song on the cd is Look On.   Incredible song with the best guitar solo by John yet.   I recommend this album completely.
0783225849|5.0|I have never seen this movie until tonight, but one view of this movie and I can say this is one of the best horror films ever created. Alfred Hitchcock really knows how to create atmosphere and that alone is what makes this movie more than just a horror flick. And Psycho, I won't tell you what happens, but it comes to a point to where the movie totally delves into the mind and the possibilities within. The famous \\"shower scene\\" is intense because of the whole atmospheric build-up before the woman is killed. And I will tell you, since I have seen this movie, I will be taking a second glance over that shower curtain.<br /><br />One more thing, to that one star idiot. It is Ed GEIN, not Ed Gaines you foolish imbecile. That right there proves that you have no idea what the hell you are talking about when you bad-mouth this movie. Take the corncob out of your arse and be quiet you infantile little snot.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie, about a nerdy kid, is definitely one that any of us can relate to. It's not that I want to spoil it, I want you to see it for yourself. Definitely worth all of the money, and the deleted scenes rock. <br />-Katie Burnett
B000002UA9|5.0|And if you're a true beatles fan you should have it.  My fave songs on this album are I saw her standing there, Anna (go to him), Ask me why, please please me, do you want to know a secret and there's a place.  To people who enjoy late beatles or classic rock from the 70's, this might be hard to adjust to...  But I love early beatles so naturally I enjoy the corniness and cuteness of the vocals and lyrics in this album.
B00065U08Q|5.0|This album came out of nowhere, and the style had totally changed.   Instead of a rock album, this was an experimental partially techno partially piano dominated album.   The opening song is wonderful.   It's a 10 minute song and has a beautiful guitar part that John made in the song.   This is more of Josh Klinghoffer's album more than John's.   Josh sing's a dominant amount of the tracks.   Communique is the best song on the album, along with sphere.   Also the final track is just John and piano.   \\"My Life\\" is the song, which at times sounds like \\"Let It Be\\" by The Beatles.   very pretty song
0517220784|5.0|Anyone who has any interest in literature should read at least most of the original Sherlock Holmes stories. Not only are these great jigsaw puzzles that challenge the reader's imagination, but they collectively construct one of the greatest characters ever to be conceived. Holmes is far from the flat intellectual personality that one might imagine, or as he is sometimes portrayed on screen. <br /> <br />Some of my favorites: <br />The Red-headed League <br />The Man with the Twisted Lip <br />The Adventure of the Six Napoleons <br />The Problem of Thor Bridge <br /> <br />This book does use a very small font (as others have mentioned), this didn't present any problems for me, but I can imagine how it would for others. There are also a few more typos than usual. But nevertheless, 5 stars as I enjoyed reading it and will probably read it several times more.

Not too many games out there can fit this description, so check it out.
B000002UAU|5.0|\\"A Day in the Life\\" is quite simply the greatest song ever written by the greatest band to ever play instruments. I have been listening to Sgt Pepper since for more than 20 years now, and I still get goosebumps.
B0001XALTG|5.0|I'm sorry it has taken me so long to write a review for this movie.  If you are reading this and do not own it buy it now.  The look, the genius, the color, the music, the best.  A whimsical world of heroine is traced in this Scottish-speaking masterpiece.  I hold it up there with classics such as \\"Pulp Fiction.\\"  It is by far my most favorite film in my collection.
0060958324|5.0|\\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" is an astonishingly good book, even though it's hard to characterize.  It's a travelogue, philosophical meditation, intellectual autobiography, father/son story, spiritual quest, and tale of madness -- all rolled into one.  Because of the book's ambition, it's easy to take cheap shots at it.  For example, it's impossible to deny that the author, Robert Pirsig, is a crank -- who else would believe that he's solved the deepest problems of Western civilization?  It's also true that some of Pirsig's details about Greek philosophy and the history of science are wrong -- Copernicus did not, for example, discover that the Earth is round.  However, these are quibbles.  The overall impression \\"ZAMM\\" leaves on the reader is that thinking is a serious, almost life-or-death adventure.  In a culture awash with materialism, fundamentalism, and nonsense disseminated on the internet, that's a huge accomplishment.  I can't think of any book that would do a better job of getting an intelligent high school or college student turned on to philosophy.  Six stars!
0316779237|3.0|I have read Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim and Me Talk Pretty One Day.  I love them both with everything in me.  So, I was very excited to backtrack and read Holidays on Ice.  I waited until I went to New York for Christmas and took the book with me with high hopes.  I was very disappointed.  I was not aware that a lot of Sedaris' early writing was simply fiction and did not really have grounding in his family or life--most of this book is like that.  The stories are mildly entertaining and imaginative.  They seemed even darker than usual and even more cynical than I could handle, which I found strange.  David's cynical outlook framed in a humorous, matter-of-fact manner is one of the things I love about him.  A couple of the entries in this book almost made me feel dirty, due to disturbing violent imagery.  However, the very thing, which took it way over the top, also is what helped get the point across.  I would still recommend this book for any Sedaris fan.  Don't read it to get in the Christmas mood and you will be fine, come at it with the framework as a social commentary.
B000002J1U|5.0|With the third album we start to hear the maturing LED ZEP sound we all know and love.  Great riffs that move from the early ZEP sound to their most productive middle period.  Great Zep sounds as usual. Rock at it's hard hitting best. An essential part of any rock collection.
B0002S947K|3.0|a nice display of \\"white\\" soul-ish, dirty folk-r/b pop. it doesn't seem to me that he's van morrison  at all, more like the band, and he sounds like ryan adams (he's wonder-full!!!).  he's got an interesting story, kind of helps his media marketing.. worth picking up but not that incredible.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I didn't know about slipknot before, but the vol. 3 THE SUBLIMINAL VERSES is one of the best cd's I ever bought.

B000646MNE|5.0|Sex and the City is a magnificent tv show starring four New York women.  In the show you learn about the love and the lives of these women.

B00008J4P5|3.0|Really good CD- some reviewers said they wre going for a Zeppelin-sound - late, uninspired Zeppelin.  Anyway, the best comparison is with 80's hair metal - have the feeling this album was meant to be silly, after all the expectations raised about the band.  The earlier CD's seemed to be all rhythm - here he's trying to have fun sort of playing lead, if that makes any sense when talking a band with one guitar.  That said, the lyrics are great (\\"Girl, You Have No Faith in Medicine,\\" \\"Hardest Button to Button\\"), and this is better than a lot that's out there.
B000669GAI|4.0|This CD is a collection of Pearl Jam's most well-known songs. These are certainlly great songs but they are only the tip of the iceberg. Pearl Jam has a tremendous amount of songs that are great and not included on this album. If you are a die-hard PJ fan who owns every CD, there is no need to buy this CD. However, if you are casual fan, this is the perfect album for you. However, I would encourage you to buy some lesser known PJ albums like Yield or No Code to hear just how great PJ really is.
0345350499|2.0|As you can probably tell by other reviews, most people either hate this book or love it.  I'm of the former school.  While I acknowledge its importance as a \\"feminist-revisionist\\" approach to Arthurian myth, I'm just not a content-over-form type of reader.  This book is abominably didactic, not to mention **very** poorly written.  The dialogue is horrible.  MZB's prose is stilted & amateurish (at best) & the whole thing just reeks of that cheesy neo-Druid goddess-worship that calls itself feminism.  And those who accuse MZB of religious bias are correct.  The anti-Xian stuff is a given, I think, but expected considering the book's subject matter.  I wasn't bothered by it.  However, Bradley is also pretty harsh on atheists & agnostics (like myself)-- in fact, she's pretty much harsh on anyone who doesn't subscribe to a very specific sect of paganism...  Anyhow, there's better stuff out there, but if you're into all that pagan-\\"feminism\\" stuff, this is probably the book for you.
B00004XQP4|5.0|So after the disappointing Nimrod, Green Day with the surprising and amazing Warning album. This is by far one of the best albums I have ever listened to and also one of the most underrated. It seems that most of the record buying public doesn't want change from Green Day. Instead they want punk like riffs that sound heavy. None of that can be found on this record except for maybe Minority but with quality tracks like Church on Sunday, Waiting, Warning and Macy's Day Parade there's no need for complaints.
B00005JKQ6|4.0|This is a slightly disturbing yet beautifully simple story of a man's slow unnerving return home. Burt Lancaster plays Ned Merril, a seemingly popular socialite amongst the wealthy suburban estates he neighbors. But today he has decided to swim home, going from pool to pool in a metaphorical river back to the home he shares with his wife and two daughters. Along the way he meets people he knows, including a young woman who once baby-sat his kids. But the more he swims, and the closer he gets to home, the more his facade of charm and joviality melts, ultimately revealing something else altogether.   Lancaster is great in the part. And considering he was a major actor at the time, this is a risky part, one it must be said, he plays in a bathing suit and nothing else. He is also in every scene. The man's eventual deterioration though is dealt with well, slowly building as the audience gets clues as to the possible ills surrounding him and his family. Based on a John Cheever short story, this is an excellent, yet troubling film, one possibly not well known, but featuring a superb performance from Lancaster.
B00005JMUL|3.0|I saw this movie in 3D at the IMAX theatre in downtown San Francisco.  The technical features are spectacular.  There are several breathtaking scenes, including snowflakes falling down from the sky, the train sliding right over you on the ice, the roller coaster ride in the North Pole, and three children walking on a very high bridge. <br /> <br />There is not much beyond technical brilliance.  The movie lacks emotional warmth and magic that usually exist in a Christmas movie, such as Elf or The Santa Clause.  The train conductor and the guy on top of the train are sometimes too creepy, maybe that is why some young kids do not like the movie.  This movie won't make you a believer of Santa Clause for sure.
B00000I01A|5.0|Rocky IV was always one my favorite movies back when I was <br />a kid in the mid 80's.. The soundtrack for this album played <br />a really big part in my interest in the movie. The solid <br />band Survivor comes back with a another really good song <br />\\"Burning Heart\\" that helps make the movie worthwhile.. But <br />to me other than \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" the best track is \\"No <br />Easy Way Out\\" as the beat to that song is niffy and fits <br />it's part in the movie. The guy doing the singing is pretty <br />good also.. And we have a niffy James Brown tune that gets <br />decent play in my cd player. The only song that had no <br />interest to me is \\"Double Trouble\\" as I can't say it's a <br />bad song... It just doesn't do anything for me.  <br /> <br />I wish there was some real rocking stuff on here... But I <br />guess it wouldn't fit aswell. Still one of the best sound <br />track albums ever...
B00005JNBQ|5.0|As someone who has been to Preston Idaho, has a good friend from there (who is currently in Afghanistan), and currently lives in Utah, (but went to High School in semi-rural Massachusetts, class of 84), this movie moved me quite a bit.  I won't say I was a Napoleon in school, but the situations, and the characters, should be familiar to anyone who went to a small town high school.  While it does not have a plot in a normal literary sense, it very definitely has a meaning.  It is a humorous, subtle, revenge of the nerds.  Everyone who was not a jock or cool dude in High School can probably relate and enjoy.    For those people who are confused about the setting of the movie -- it is in the current time, probably 2004 (in the opening credits the HS ID card is labeled 2004-2005).  This is \\"small town\\", and in Idaho, where, like Utah, trends take 10 years to show up from the West or East coast.  The everage student at Preston High in the movie looks like they are from the current age -- Napoleon, who seems to shop at the local \\"DI\\" (Deseret Industries -- Idaho, Utah, NV, Arizona thrift store chain), like many people in small towns who don't have lots of funds, probably do -- looks like the 80s some of the time because of his economic \\"class\\" which leads to his choice of stores to shop at (see above).    All the \\"Flip\\", \\"Fetch\\", \\"Sweet\\" and such words bring a smile to anyone who has lived in Idaho or Utah.  There is a \\"local\\" feel but excepting some of the Idaho/Utah culture that sometimes shines through, this could have been set in Indiana or Nebraska or Iowa or anywhere else with small rural towns.    I thought it was great.  My brother back in New Hampshire thought it was funny, but probably would have given it 3 stars. My wife, who is from Japan, left after the first 30 minutes -- she doesn't have the cultural background to relate at all...    The last scene of the movie, with the dodgeball, brought it all to a touching conclusion for me.  In their own ways, the geeks or nerds find friendship and \\"love\\" as well...
B00005NKK8|5.0|This album is HUGE and great. Lots of great music by different <br />singers/bands. The album follows the time period thoughout  <br />this movie starting in the 50's and 60's. You have \\"Sweet  <br />Home Alabama\\" which is considered by many to be one if not  <br />the greatest southern rock songs ever. I'm not a huge fan  <br />of the band, but there is no denying the greatness of some of their work.  <br /> <br />You have some great MoTown cuts like \\"I Can't Help Myself\\"  <br />by The Four Tops is one of my favorite Motown classics. We   <br />also have Frankins \\"Respect\\" that is a classic that you  <br />just have to love. This is arguably the best soundtrack  <br />ever put together. If you love 50-70's music there has to  <br />be some stuff here for you. Jackson Browne classic  <br />\\"Running On Empty\\" is another track not to miss aswell as  <br />CCR's classic\\"Fortunate Son\\" another outstanding track. If  <br />you were to put together a classic album spanding 4 decades  <br />this 2 disk set would be close to being perfect. <br /> <br />This is a must have for lovers of classic music that has  <br />stood the test of time.

B0002OERI0|5.0|I've had an off and on interest in Green Day since I first heard them 10 years ago or whatever, but I've never really been able to get all that into them.  From Going to Pasalaqua to Warning, I've really enjoyed a lot of Green Day songs, but any time I've listened to a whole album there have been just too many songs that seemed to drop off in quality.  But this album is great from start to finish.  The band sounds as loose and energetic as they did on Kerplunk! but much better and more focused from their years of experience.  I think a few years out of the limelight and a couple albums that didn't become huge hits might have given the band enough distance from their star status so that they could really concentrate on the music and develop something special. <br />The title track is an awesome song and the album never drops off afterwards... alot of energy and great lyrics.  It's pop punk and its got a message too (the two can go together!)
B000003C2U|5.0|Death is a unique and highly creative band, and Human captures them in what is arguably their prime. This is music that is built on dissonance in a way I have never heard elsewhere. Singer, guitarist, and songwriter Chuck Schuldiner is truly in a league of his own, disregarding every rule of music theory, and creating an album of music that is twisted and bizarre, but often catchy and inviting. There is an unharnessed aggression on this album that is brought out by the cold, distant production, demonstrating a strange paradox about the music -- it sounds spontaneous, but also complex and painstakingly crafted. If you can own only one death metal album, Death is probably the band, and Human just may be the album. It isn't as primal as Scream Bloody Gore, and it doesn't have the production of Sound of Perseverance, but it is a near-perfect document of amazing death metal music. Listening to it gives the listener a sense that he is listening in on Schuldiner's innermost abstract thoughts.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I will always remember the first time I heard \\"Wicked\\".  There aren't many experiences I've had in my life that I can qualify like that.  All technical complaints aside, there has to be some sort of magic in a musical that touches so many people this way.  I was lucky enough to see it just before Kristin left the cast and I have to say that after all the months of listening to the music, it was a beautiful experience to finally see the show live.  Emotional is not even the word. <br />Idina was my far-and-away favorite from listening to the soundtrack, but the one thing you can't capture on the CD is the comic genius that is Kristin Chenoweth.  People refer to her that way all the time but you really don't know til you've seen what she can do.  Gifted is all I can say about her.  It was so clear from watching them together that the two leads had developed such respect and affection for one another.   <br />Honestly, I can't even put into words the beauty and emotion this show evokes.  I've listened to it countless times and love it more every day.  If you can, and even though the cast is no longer the original, please see it.  You'll be awestruck.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Living in Europe and being a regular reader of various British news sources and music magazines I quickly came <br />across Franz Ferdinand, early 2004. Soon I decided to check out their song 'Take Me Out' and took an instant liking to them. The album I purchased this summer. <br /> <br />Now for a moment let us forget the hype surrounding Franz and concentrate on the music. The name of the band is certainly remarkable, but those of us who are somewhat educated(it helps to be from Europe) certainly already knew of the role of the Archduke in world history. It certainly seemed as though Franz esteemed their talents very highly by choosing such a name. But do they live up to their promise? <br /> <br />Franz Ferdinand have been described as 'New Wave '80s Post Punk'. I truly have no idea what kind of music this alludes to, having never conciously lived through the '80s. But there are other influences in Franz's work. Specifically the influence of German music. It is difficult to describe. But Alex's intonation and his style of singing take after German pop. Also the use of stomping, marching rhythms, the German songtitle, the German verse at the end of 'Darts of Pleasure' and the allusions to Nazi Germany in their music videos indicate an interest. There is also the influence of stage musicals and vaudeville present, as evidenced by the lyrics. <br /> <br />If there is a criticism it is that all the songs have similar chord structures. I have noticed this as our band is playing some of Franz's songs. The rhythms and tempi are rather similar too, all of which cause Franz Ferdinand's songs to seem rather similar. This is the reason why I am not reviewing the songs one by one. I shall name some stand out tracks, though of course all of them are good. <br /> <br />Jacqueline - begins deceptively quietly, but then crescendoes into a full-scale stomper. The lyrics are also great, \\"It's always better on holiday\\". <br /> <br />Take Me Out - This is their first single. What really makes this song stand out are the changes in tempo. <br /> <br />In the Dark of the Matine - The 2nd single. The video shows the band as pupils in a class watching some sort of Nazi propaganda film. There is not much I can say about this song except that it is very sexy(honestly, almost all of the songs on the album are) and catchy, catchy, catchy. <br /> <br />Darts of Pleasure - Fantastic lyrics, and the German verse turns this one into a winner. <br /> <br />Michael - Some intolerant reviewers have trashed this song merely for it's homo-erotic lyrics. Open your mind, for heaven's sake! <br /> <br />'40 Feet - Actually this song has great sentimental value for me. Gives the impression of lazy and lost summer days at the beach. <br /> <br />Ignore the hype, which will cause a lot of people to think that this band is overrated. Although they might not be the second coming they're still damn enjoyable. And did I mention this album is great to dance to? Admittedly I never dance to it since I can't dance to save my life. This record is great for the summer, to listen to which lazing around sipping iced drinks at the beach.
B00000IOSU|3.0|Like ac_mcfa82 below, I think this CD is not a great \\"Live\\" CD because it was too over-produced.<br /><br />Granted, the performances are FLAWLESS, the sound is FLAWLESS, everything is perfect.  Too perfect.  For this CD they recorded concert tracks at multiple venues during her Surfacing tour, and chose the best ones to put on the CD (it's *not* a CD copy of the Live DVD).  While this makes good sense quality-wise, it doesn't make for a very involving live album.  The tracks fade in and out, like on a studio album, and there is no cute banter with the audience at all.<br /><br />Listening to Mirrorball you do not get the feeling that you're at a Sarah concert; it's more like a \\"Best of Sarah McLachlan Live\\" compilation.  If you don't mind that then this CD is for you, like I said, it's technically perfect.  But if you're looking for a concert experience, you won't find it here.<br /><br />If you're looking for an accurate recording of a Sarah McLachlan concert, try Afterglow Live!  Though it's not *quite* as technically perfect (performance wise or sound-quality wise) as Mirrorball, it's a much more involving album and a better representation of what she's like live.
B0000046KM|5.0|Shirley Horn is a woman of plenty of style,plenty of grace and plenty of talent.I brought this album on cassette around 1992 (No cds at that time) when it first  came out.I wasn't expecting anything fantastic or exraordinary.I brought the album mainly because Shirley  Horn looked so elegant and classy on the album cover.She  looks like she's ready for a night out on the town.And I  said to myself 'If the music is as good as the album cover I can't lose,and if not all I'm out of is a few dollars'.Now when I got the album home and gave it a listen.It just blew me away,what a great piece of work.  Ms Horn is in the same elite league as Ella Fizgerald,  Billie Holiday,Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington(Those  ladies are no longer with us but they still live in our  memories).On Here's To Life(an album dedicated to Miles  Davis)Shirley Horn teams up with producer and arranger  Johnny Mandel for the first time(The next teaming of the  two would be a few years later on the 2001 release You're My Thrill).Shirley a long time fan of Mandel's music made the Here's To Life project even more special for the both of them.Shirley Horn is such a gifted singer and with great interception of lyrics.When she sings it's like she's singing only to you.She sings so slowly at times that you find yourself hanging on the edge of your seat.  Waiting for the next word to come out of her mouth to satisty your soul.And Johnny Mandel's arrangements are lush and beautiful and complements Ms Horn's style of music perfectly.Mr Mandel also co-wrote three of the songs on the album.Being backed up by violins,cellos,  flutes,harps,french horns and a host of other instruments Shirley Horn delivers a masterpiece.From the first note to the last you are transported to a place I call 'Shirley's World' a world she shares with us through her  music.Here's To life is a perfect album to relax to or  to share with someone over a candlelight dinner.Or maybe  you don't want to do anything but listen to some great  music.The song selection on the album is wonderful.And my personal favorites are Come A Little Closer/Wild Is The Wind, Return To Paradise and If You Love Me.But nevermind me the other eight songs on the album are just as great.  Thanks Shirley for sharing your world with us.to some great    music.The song selection on the album is wonderful.And my personal favorites are Come A Little Closer/Wild Is The Wind, Return To Paradise and If You Love Me.But nevermind me the other eight songs on the album are just as great.  Thanks Shirley for sharing your world with us.
B000002MX7|5.0|Epiphany: The Best of Chaka Khan is a long overdue greatest hits collection of one of the most influential singers ever.  Chaka Khan's stamp on the music industry is well documented.  Known early in her career as \\"Little Aretha\\" this sexy siren has a voice which such range.  From highs to lows and even some screaming on key, this is an incredible singer. <br /> <br />Included on the 16 track cd are some of her biggest hits like the touching \\"Through The Fire\\", the mega smash Prince remake \\"I Feel For You\\" and her first solo hit \\"I'm Every Woman,\\" a track later remade by Whitney Houston.    There is also a live version of \\"Tell Me Something Good\\" -the Stevie Wonder written hit for Rufus and Chaka Khan. Other selections featured on the cd may not be big hits but they definitely showcase the dynamics and versatility of Chaka's voice.  Songs like \\"Night In Tunasia\\" and \\"The End Of A Love Affair\\" demonstrate what Chaka can do when it comes to a jazz tune.  There is also the heartfelt \\"Love Me Still\\", a collaboration with Bruce Hornsby from Spike Lee's CLOCKERS soundtrack. <br /> <br />This best of cd also features 5 new songs.  These songs actually were apart of a shelved 1995 Chaka cd entitled \\"Dare You To Love Me.\\"  \\"Everywhere\\" is a Fleetwood Mac song that Chaka reworks, but instead of a traditional rock rhythm....it's done reggae style.  \\"Never Miss The Water\\" is a funky tune which features R&B/bassist M'shelle N'degeocello.  \\"Something Deep\\" continues the funkiness.  However the mood gets more somber and touching with \\"Your Love Is All I Know\\" - a Chris Walker remake.  Closing out the best of cd is a jazzy/fusion song called \\"Every Little Thing.\\"  <br /> <br />This may not be a complete best of cd whereas some significant hits like \\"Sweet Thing\\" or \\"Everlasting Love\\" could have been added.  But still the track selection is a solid offering of Chaka Khan, one of the most copied and influential voices in the music industry.
B0001MDP3G|3.0|The early battle scene is the most gut-wrenching image of war that I have seen on film. Its darkness, claustrophobia, savagery, hopelessness, desperation is only heightened by the background music: the shape-note singing of Idumea, an American religious chant at once ecstatic, popular and primitive. And the knowledge that these are Americans killing one another gives chilling irony to the words \\"civil war\\". My stomach still hurts. A moment when art makes horror almost beautiful.
0553260111|4.0|The Bourne Identity is a well-written thriller.  It has a strong and consistant plot spiced with many details.  I think that even though it might not be that believable at times, that is what a book is created for, to escape our \\"real world.\\"   <br /> <br />Robert Ludlum produced a world where confusion and caas engulf Jason Bourne.  This leaves Bourne to travel the unknown labyrinth of the world and his own mind.  All the time, facing new and dangerous adventures.  To sum it up, it was a fun book to read.
B0000019PA|1.0|This is the most painfully pretentious pile of dreck ever produced. I know quite a few people who swear that Neutral Milk Hotel are the greatest thing since Oreos, but the off-key singing, overwrought lyrics that try REALLY hard to be deep and touching and the headache inducing lo-fi production make this one of the least impressive widely loved albums.  Actually, It's a mystery to me why people like this band so much.  I mean...  I understand that you have to like some things to be considered hip, but Neutral Milk Hotel cover up talentless bass playing by layering so much fuzz on the bass that there is a low-end buzz through the whole album that makes my teeth hurt.  Do yourself a favor, listen to the song \\"Demented Man\\" from Warrior on the Edge of Time by Hawkwind.  Every Neutral Milk Hotel song is an attempt by a sad hipster to duplicate this rad tune from the 70's.
B000068TPN|5.0|....here's another movie used by Mel Gisbson to show the world what a devoted Cathiloc he is.
B0002Z1EG2|1.0|Only the masterful Shania Twain can incorporate the two most deeply-rewarding and expressive genres of music: pop and country!  Whether she's shrieking and giggling or whirling and feigning hick, I just can't get enough of this awesome country chick!<br /><br />Well, gotta go, my ferrets need their anal electrocution before Tess of the D'Ubervilles shows up with the goat milk!<br /><br />Buh-bye!
B0002ZDVF4|2.0|The idiots who made this film apparently had no idea why the first Bourne film was so great. The Bourne character is a shadow of his former self, with an almost total absence of character development. What there is of Bourne's famous inner conflict is mostly a shallow rehash of a few moments that were better done in the first film. Matt Damon does a good job of breathing life into the material, but unfortunately the script is as amateurish as a second-rate Marvel comicbook. All the other characters are strictly 2-D. <br /> <br />The filmmakers (and presumably the author) apparently know little about story arcs. They kill off the female romantic lead in the first five minutes, quickly putting an end to the dramatic juxtaposition that made the first film so popular with women. They do bring forward a potentially excellent villain -- adding evil intensity to a character from the first film. Then, surprise surprise, they kill the villain off half way through the movie! (They don't even do him in properly, in my opinion.) <br /> <br />So what's left? Car chase after car chase, through exotic locations. That's about the extent of the imagination that went into this sorry exercise. They even skimped on the C.I.A. high-tech wonders that were so fascinating in the first movie.  <br /> <br />If you like car crashes you will love The Bourne Supremacy. Otherwise, welcome to Hollywood at its dumbest. <br /> <br />'nuff said <br />
B0001BKAEY|4.0|Revolutions manages to clear the cobwebs of confusion that Reloaded left me with. The good vs. evil becomes clearer, and the plot moves at an intense, yet even pace. The action scenes are great fun. I particularly enjoyed the concluded Smith(s) encounter. There is some metaphysical dialogue, but it does not distract--rather it adds an almost ironic humor to the battle. Additionally, the \\"nose to the grindstone\\" vs. fighting for faith dilemma that settles on Zion is almost a mirror image of America's spiritual landscape. Believers far outnumber the skeptics--yet the voices rage with almost even volume. Quite a commentary. <br /> <br />On the down side, this was not a deep conclusion. Everything wrapped up rather neatly, and perhaps too easily. Additionally, for such a upbeat finale, the scenery was quite dark, making it a bit of a chore to watch. <br /> <br />Bottom-line: This was a decent ending to an interesting movie series, that would probably make a better and most intriguing novel series. It's enjoyable, if not a bit frantic and dark.
B0006399FS|1.0|Ok mates, let's get honest for a while. All we're U2 fans here, but... where's the excitement in this album ? I mean, all we already have All That You Can't Leave Behind, so why do we need this one ?. As many fans pointed out here, this album has nothing new, neither nothing worthy. It's true City of Blinding Lights is a great song, but what about the rest ?.    Another safe and hyped album isn't pleasant listening for me, really.   This is desperate stuff with hamfisted lyrics and very little room for melodies and new ideas. I really don't know why U2 felt the need in release this half-worked stuff from All That You Can't Leave Behind.     They seem to spend more time in promoting any new album rather than writing truly worthy music for it. This album is musically turgid and thematically empty. After 5 listenings to it, the only words that keep in my mind are MONEY, GRAMMY and IPOD, what a pity.     You could miss this album out entirely, really you could, although if you're a collector fan you'll want to get it. Anyway, in the end you'll realise you were ripped off by this huge marketing campaign.    classic U2 sounding doesn't mean the same keyboards and guitar sections again and again.    I know if you're a casual fan you've been told Zooropa and Pop aren't that good, but now it's time to take a complete and serious listening to both albums ( even better with headphones ). You'll be so excited by that experimental U2, because you'll realise how wonderful those albums are...but you'll be so dissapointed by this hyped sold 2000 band.     Wanna try ?
0671004107|4.0|The novel Contact by Carl Sagan was an excellent read.  Carl Sagan tells the story of Eleanor Arroway's search for extraterrestrial life.  The trials and tribulations that she goes through in order to reach her goal are amazing.  After many long years of research, she is rewarded with a transmission that appears to be coming from near the star Vega.  Ellie immediately begins decoding the message.  Ellie's life is forever changed by her discovery of the transmission. <br />     Ellie has a rough time in becoming an astronomer and her life doesn't get any easier.  Through college, she is the only girl in her glasses and is often made fun of by the other students.  Following her graduation, she begins as an observer and works her way up to being the Head Supervisor of the Project Argus observatory in New Mexico.  Fellow astronomers believe that the SETI project that Argus is focused is on is an extreme waste of time and money.  Ellie must defend her position constantly.  After Argus radio telescopes pick-up the transmission, Ellie is forced to deal with the constant nagging of government officials and religious leaders.  Ellie never gives up on her search and continues it no matter what problems come up. The discovery of the Message spreads throughout the world and the decisions are no longer Ellie's to make.  A great adventure begins that will leave the reader with a great desire to know what will happen next. <br />     This science-fiction novel is an excellent choice if one is interested in adventure and the struggles of a woman to have equal respect in the world.  Although the novel is slightly jumpy at times, the adventure that the people must face is not too hard to understand.  The novel also digs deep into the feelings and thoughts of Dr. Arroway.  It allows the reader to understand Ellie's decisions while enjoying the novel.  I strongly suggest that everyone read this novel and enjoy the adventure.
B0002EXH54|5.0|Megadeth's  PSBWB album put Megadeth \\"on the map\\"...and with good reason...This cd  contains some of the best speed/thrash metal that I have ever heard! Now, about this remixed/remastered version, there are some songs that I like remixed/remastered and some songs that I like the original sound better on.<br /><br />The songs that I like the original production on are Wake Up Dead, Peace Sells But Who's Buying, and Devil's Island. Here are the reasons why I like the originals better...On Wake Up Dead, the remixed vocals at the end of the song sound like crap in my opinion, and I like the original drums better on this song, Gar's cymbals just seem to literally cut thru the song, and his snare sounds better on the original.  Peace Sells the original sounds better too for the drums and I love the raw power of the original on this song. Now, Devil's Island, there's something about Gar's snare, hi-hats, and cymbals that just sound better to me, I guess you wouldn't really notice unless you play drums, and his ride cymbal bell that uses thru-out the album sounds louder and more defined, which I like better.<br /><br />Now, onto The Conjuring remixed/remastered, this song sounds a lot better to me. I always thought that the original sounded great, but it seemed kind of weak sounding with the original production, now with the crisp, clean remaster is seems to have added some weight/muscle to it. I feel the same about Bad Omen, I thought that it was a really cool song, but the original production seemed to make it kind of weak, and now with the remastered version it sounds a lot meatier.  Black Friday and my favorite My Last Words, sound excellent remasterd, the only thing I don't like is how the Gar's tom rolls and ride cymbal bell use kind of toned down, but other than that they sound awesome!<br /><br />So for me, I burned my own compilation cd and mixed the originals with the remasters, with the only set back is having to play with the volume control, but for me, this is my opinion on the original vs. the remastered version, I say get both!!!<br /><br />13 out of 5 stars!his is my opinion on the original vs. the remastered version, I say get both!!! <br />13 out of 5 stars!
B000001ELF|5.0|Ace Frehley's self-titled 1978 solo album is a classic rock album.  While Paul Stanley's solo album is my personal favorite, Frehley's solo album is very good also.  What I like about Frehley's solo album is that on this album, Frehley releases the side of him fans had never seen before.  Yes, we've heard the earlier KISS classic \\"Shock Me\\", which Frehley both wrote and sang, but in the original line-up of KISS, Frehley probably did not get the microphone as much as Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, and Peter Criss did.  Ace Frehley is all about music- and this album proves it.  \\"Rip It Out\\" is a good way to open an album, and while all of the material on here is all very good, some of the songs on here are also funny.  With no argument, the best song on here is Frehley's cover version of Hello's \\"New York Groove\\".  Frehley made the right choice to cover \\"New York Groove\\", as it was not only a great cover version, but the best out of the singles Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, and Peter Criss released off of their solo albums.  If you don't have Ace Frehley's solo album, your collection of KISS albums is incomplete.
B00000F14B|5.0|Meridith Willson's gentle musical about his native state in the early 20th century is beautifully committed to film.  Robert Preston, Paul Ford, and Hermione Gingold -- scene stealers all, and what a chemistry they brought to this wonderful film.  Shirley Jones as Marian, Pert Kelton reprising her Broadway role as Widow Paroo, and Ron Howard as Winthrop, all fit into their characters as though they were them.<br /><br />The very funny malapropisms of Paul Ford, the \\"not on yer tin type, girly girl!\\" of Harry Hickox, and Buddy Hackett add so much more humor to an already funny book.  But my favorite has to be the \\"Pick a Little, Talk a Little\\" ladies.  What a stitch!!<br /><br />While I've seen numerous stage productions, and Matthew Broderick's excellent \\"Professor Hill\\" on TV, Robert Preston will always be my Music Man.<br /><br />This is a keeper.

B00009W0U4|1.0|This film was only made for exploitation and shock value. I see no entertainment value in this movie. I wish I never watched it. There is no character development, not much of a plot. The only reason this film received praise is because it's French which automatically puts in the artsy category. Vincent is a great actor but he's wasted in this mess. After watching this film the only things you will remember are the brutal rape and violence scenes. To prove that, in the DVD extras all the director talks about are the rape and violence scenes, he could careless about actor interviews or any other insights about the film.
B00004TDTO|5.0|I haven't read all of the other reviews of \\"Jaws\\", so I don't know if there's any praise to be heaped on this movie that hasn't been covered yet, but here goes anyway.  \\"Jaws\\" is one of the true great \\"monster movies\\" ever made - it may be the best of the genre since \\"King Kong\\", and it hasn't been surpassed.  The really great thing about this film is how laughably terrible it could have been (just look at all of the ripoffs that followed - even the \\"Jaws\\" sequels after \\"Jaws II\\").  Somehow, though, everything fits together, from the strong performances from every actor involved (except for Bruce the mechanical shark,), to John Williams' score (I've heard that Spielberg laughed when Williams first played the score for him, thinking Williams was joking, but those couple of notes are as scary in their simplicity as the \\"Psycho\\" score).  I'm sure this film is constantly dissected in filmmaking classes - even as a casual viewer, I catch something new every time I watch it.  \\"Jaws\\" is a textbook example of effective moviemaking, and a great rollercoaster ride of a movie.

B000002H33|5.0|So then, 'Master Of Puppets', can it live up to the hype? Yes it can. <br /> <br />Track By Track <br /> <br />Battery: A fantastic opener. Great build up of tension to start, all regurgitated in fantastic fashion as one the greatest album openers of all time (So far I think only 'Aces High' from Iron Maiden's `Powerslave' tops it). An absolutely brutal song, unrelenting and with a great wah drenched solo from Hammet. In other reviews I've seen the musicianship of the band slandered. Well for those guitar players amongst you try nailing the main riff to this song, and you'll see why many regard Hetfield as the greatest metal rhythm player of all time. <br /> <br />Master Of Puppets: This song is just too good. It starts of good, gets better, and then finishes with a bang (Actually manic laughter). Great interlude, showing the band can do subtle as well as all out thrash. Again Hammet provides a fantastic guitar solo, as does Hetfield in the interlude. This song has to be heard to be believed. The pinnacle of the thrash genre, in my opinion. <br /> <br />The Thing That Should Not Be: Another beauty of a song, though possibly a very, very slight dip in form from the previous efforts on the album, though it's virtually impossible not to be. Another great Hammet solo (spot a pattern here) though this time Atonal, unusual for him.  While not as good as the previous two, if it were a school kid it'd still be bringing home straight A grades. <br /> <br />Welcome Home (Sanitarium): They've proved they can thrash, now they prove they can do melodic. The lyrics in this song really shine, probably because you're paying more attention to them as you're not headbanging so hard. The chorus is where this song achieves greatness, when it comes crashing in it is just so powerful, it's unbelievable. <br /> <br />Disposable Heroes: Another great set of lyrics, exploring the futility of war. This song sees Metallica back into thrashing away like they do best. A very good song, but probably the worst on the album so far. Leper Messiah continues this slight dip in form, begun with Lars' counting in but never quite achieving the highs much of this album does. <br /> <br />While the last two songs are a slight dip in form, it is only from sublime to exceptional, they're still fantastic. Now on to the final quarter of the album, which like the Australian cricket team when batting, hits hard right to the tail. <br /> <br />Orion: I'm not usually a great fan of instrumentals, this is one of the few I listen to. Great riffs throughout and some great bass work from the now deceased Cliff Burton.  <br /> <br />Damage Inc: A great album closer, the most thrash of all the songs on this album it begins with some haunting volume pedal work from Cliff Burton. Then everything comes crashing in. At high speed. Very High Speed. Very Very High Speed. Not quite as fast as some Slayer but still scorching quick. Hammet Pulls out another great solo, the beginning of which is the third fastest guitar playing ever recorded at around 19 notes per second (And people have been saying he can't play........) After the solo more blistering riffing including the line 'F**k it all and F**king no regrets', later to resurface on St Anger. A great album closer. <br /> <br />I'm a big fan of heavy metal in general. I've hard a lot of what there is to offer, but by no means all of it. So far, I have found nothing that betters this offering from Metallica. 'Powerslave' from Maiden comes close, as does 'Rust in Peace' form Megadeth but nothing as yet has topped it. While Metallica may not be the most talented musicians in this genre (That crown probably goes to the 'Rust' era Megadeth, Friedman is a god) or have churned out good albums over the longest period (That has gotta be Maiden, exceptional quality all the way except for a few Blaze related incidents) they produced the one greatest heavy metal album of all time. That's my opinion anyway, though I'm always searching for somethingto better it, however hard that maybe. <br /> <br />5/5 <br /> <br />Thank You <br />
B0002WYS6S|5.0|Dream Theater's latest DVD release \\"Live At Budokan\\" is there definitely their best yet. Filmed at their show at the legenday Budokan in Japan from the Train of Thought world tour this is just more proof of why they are some of the best musicians in the world. The video is perfectly clear and the sound is very sharp which enhances the experience.    The concert kicks off with \\"As I Am\\" which is one of the best off \\"Train of Thought\\" and is played flawlessly and outdoes the album version. They play more tracks off of that album which are all done  almost perfectly. \\"Beyond This Life\\" from the \\"Scenes...\\" album has an unbelievable solo that needs to be seen to be understood of the greatness. Another stand out is the \\"Instrumedley\\" which combines many of their instrumentals combined in one song and just shows you how amazing they really are. The classic \\"Pull Me Under\\" is also performed here amazingly and \\"In The Name of God\\" is played as an encore.    The second disc of this set contains a documentary of the Japanese Tour called Riding The Train Of Thought which is very interesting to watch to see what they do to prepare for shows etc.. Also John Petrucci and Jordan Rudess give you a mini tour of their equipment which is nice to see. Mike Portnoy's drum solo is also excellent and its nice to see how he gets fans involved with it. The Opening Video to the show gives you a brief history of the band and there is a multiangle version or the Instrumedley.    Overall if you are a Dream Theater fan or into progressive hard rock or metal than you should definitely check this out. It is better than there other DVD's that are currently availabe. Also highly recommended to guitar players.
0689835604|5.0|My little one who is 9 months old now has enjoyed this book since she was 3 months.  In fact she enjoys all the Karen Katz books.  I'm not kidding you she recognizes the babies in all these books!  They are great and we love reading them to her.  She gets excited and claps when she sees the pictures!!  I totally recommend this!!!
B0002OERI0|5.0|In my opinion, this is by far the best Green Day CD yet, and I have been a fan since their first CD, 1,039 Smoothed Out Slappy Hours (before they ever made it big!).  This CD is a little different for them, I think, but it's fantastic.  Love tracks 6 and 10, which are more like their old stuff...but this whole CD is just awesome.
B00004Z459|5.0|hybrid theory is fantastic! its my favorite cd out of all of them. my favorite songs are: in the end, forgotten, and a place for my head. all the songs are extreamly catchy and i get one stuck in my head every day! but the songs are so good i dont even care that they're in my head! chester has amazing vocal skills and mikes rapping skills are unbeleavible! plus they have a varity of different types of music like, rock,rap i could go on and on. so if you like that kind of stuff i would deffenetly reccomend this cd. its flawless!  in other words its the greatest cd ever!   ~taylor~
076790592X|3.0|I found this book to be an easy read, and quite predictable. Of course the man's going to die, but I mean predictible sentiment and predictable examination of conscience, etc. It's very accessible for the casual reader (I notice many reviews by high-schoolers here) but not a challenge to understand, nothing deep, nothing we haven't heard before. Yes, we should be kind to others before it's too late. We should love one another. We should get our priorities straight, not work too much, not be afraid to hug. This book is a pleasant reminder of those lessons, but they're lessons we already know. If you like \\"Chicken Soup for the Soul\\" and other feel-good light spirituality stories, this is probably for you. If you think \\"Chicken Soup\\" is flavorless, you'll probably think the same of this story.
B00008H2LB|5.0|linkin park's new cd meteora is awsome! my favorite songs are numb,lying from you and breaking the habbit they did way better than their first cd (hybrid theory) and i thought that was impossible. joe hahns keyboard affects seemed very diffrent but still awsome. their gutair skills are still great and chester bennington seemed to experiment with screaming a little more but his vocal skills are like always....perfect! mike shinodas rapping skills are unbelieveabley great and the lyrics and songs are increadable and better than ever overall meteora is an amazing cd with no flaws what so ever! :)    ~taylor~
B00004TLN3|2.0|I was looking forward to seeing a movie version of one of Jane Austen's novels that had not been filmed in the past decade but this one really frustrated me.  While the images that play through Catherine's mind as she reads a new gothic novel are more vivid and stressed than in the book I guess that some of it was necessary in order to understand her fixation on the death of the hero's mother.  But it was over done. <br /> <br />I also found that the characters of Cassie and her obnoxious brother were much overdone showing them more as wiley villains rather than the pathetic characters in the book who must marry for money and play the game to get it.  Granted, they're not very nice people but the smirks, sneers and minxy smiles were too much. <br /> <br />The actors who played the Tilney's were fine and totally believable in their roles.  I was please that they were portrayed will skill and understatement.  But I was most disappointed in the portrayal of Catherine.  Katherine Schlesinger was too pretty, too smiley and was not believable as one of many children on a country Anglican minister. <br /> <br />The visuals are wonderful though, of the countryside and of Bath (although I wonder if that's really what it looked like, the costuming terrific and the actors who played the Allen's perfect.  And the conversation between Catherine and the Tilney's is very true to the original, especially of the day that they take a walk and a boat ride. <br /> <br />Would I recommend the movie?  If you're a died in the wool Janeite, I would say no, but if you can get beyond the fact that it's not pure Austen and want to see a lovely story, then go for it.
B0006B29Z2|5.0|My brother got this DVD for Christmas from my dad's friend and I just watched it a couple days ago.  I thought these were just gonna be a bunch of old bootlegs with bad quality but I was completely wrong.  The quality of the videos is unbelievable considering the times when these concerts were taped.  They seem like they're from only a few years ago.  The audio quality is even better.  It was restored flawlessly.  You can hear every note on the guitars and bass, and the voices and drums are clear and crisp.  Plus, Paul Di'Anno's voice is ALOT better on this DVD than on 'Iron Maiden' or  'Killers.'  My only problem with it is that on 'Beast Over Hammersmith' and 'Live in Dortmund', they don't play that many songs off of 'Piece of Mind.' <br /> <br />Features- A <br />Quality- A+ <br />Value- A+++ <br />Overall- A+ <br /> <br />If you're a REAL Iron Maiden fan, you MUST get this DVD along with 'Rock in Rio.'
B00005JMYI|4.0|I LOVED this movie when I saw it in the theatre over the past summer- so I was pumped to see an \\"unrated\\" version come out on DVD. <br /> <br />Whomever was in charge of putting this DVD together yanked a huge chain on this release.  I had expected the \\"unrated\\" version to be funnier than the theatrical version which I thought was one of the year's funniest movies, because in general, \\"unrated\\" cuts have been better than the \\"regular\\" release. <br /> <br />This \\"unrated\\" version skips a couple really great monents from the theatrical version, one instance is when Carell's character \\"Brick\\" utters \\"I ate a big red candle\\" during the party hangover sequence and they replace it with a joke that's nowhere near that great non-sequitor.  Near the end of the film they edited out Ferrell's lines just before he picks up the phone in the bar (something about \\"once being an anchorman\\")which was more in line with the film's plot/angle than the new scene of Burgundy eating cat poop. A TERRIBLY UNFUNNY ADDITION. <br /> <br />The crapper of it is, the unrated DVD has different and admittedly better extras than the theatrical DVD release, so to actually get the theatrical cut(which is a better cut than the unrated version) the customer gets screwed if they want the better extra features.  lame.  <br /> <br />in all actuality this review would be 4 for the movie, and 1 for the way this fiasco was put out on DVD. <br /> <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />
B000001ZS4|5.0|Of all the Electronic Music from that '70 period and leading up <br />to now, Jarre's stands the test of time. His orchestral approach to sounds and instruments, be they synthesized or sampled distinguishes him from most of yesterday's and today's brass. <br /> <br />How many trance, dance, techno... songs have we all heard that begin the same, have the same damn drum arrangement and even same <br />string/pad chord work, that's because today's synth nerds all need 200 synths just to make a simple bass line - with no musical theory knowledge, where as look at Jarre. He had around 8 synths and made the masterpieces that is Oxygene! Even his fellow musicians of the time Vangelis, Klaus Schulze all pioneered the way electronic music was made and communicated to the people, by using the minimum amount of instruments and maximum amount of creativity and knowledge! <br /> <br />Equinoxe to this day sounds fresh just as it did in 1978, one of the cool things Jarre does on both Oxygene and Equinoxe is treat <br />his left and right channels seperately, infact if you listen especially to Oxygene 2 and Equinoxe 4 there's difference between what you hear on the left channel compared to the right - which is the one that contains all the echo's and effects. <br />This makes his music sound fresh(As if it's been recorded today) <br />and great on stereo equipment. <br /> <br />Long Live Jarre. <br /> <br />Thanks for bringing to the world accesible ambience music fused with classy pop tunes and reaching 'extravaganza of a life time' levels at concerts - that have yet to be reached by others.
0140288503|4.0|The last \\"vacation novel\\" I took along with me was Mark Bowden's Black Hawk Down.  If you want to see the reality of war, this will deliver the goods.<br /><br />Bowden is a writer who decided to research out the story of America's involvement in Somalia, specifically the actions in Mogadishu in 1993.  The mission started out as a UN-led humanitarian effort to feed the population after years of war and the total breakdown of any sort of government.  It turned into a US action to remove a Somali warlord named Mohamed Aidid.  The whole campaign came to a head when the US ran an operation to raid a house known to house some top officials in Aidid's clan.  Due to mistakes and miscalculations, it ended with two Black Hawk helicopters being shot down, scores of dead and injured Rangers and Delta Force operators, the capture of a soldier, and images of dead US soldiers being paraded through the streets of Mogadishu.  The US commitment to the Somalia mission was questionable before the episode, and it totally evaporated after it.  Bowden takes great pains to tell the story of the soldiers who took part in the operation, and to voice their feelings and emotions of what they went through.<br /><br />As a documentary of an ugly time in US military history, Bowden has done his job well.  His research has sorted out fact from fiction, and he does a good job in telling the story without injecting personal bias until the epilogue and afterwords.  The reception from various military sources after the book was published was very positive, and speaks well to his efforts.  The book does seem to be a bit repetitive at times, as much of the action involves trying to fight their way out of tight confined quarters (or trying to navigate to a downed copter to support the downed crew).  Still, what happened is what happened, and Bowden relates it well.
6305308659|5.0|Pleasantville is like a colorized movie version of Twilight Zone.  A modern day boy (Toby McGuire) dreams of going back to the innocent days of the 1950s.  When he gets his wish via a magical stranger played by Don Knotts, he and his sister Reese Witherspoon steps into a black and white world of Pleasantville, a town stucked in the 1950s.  As the town's innocence is wiped away with the introduction of books and knowledge, color replaces the black and white starkness of the town and its people.  Beautifully acted and filmed, this movie has heart and a brain.
0767834739|1.0|This movie was so bad it made me angry. Angry because it should be scary. But this director doesn't even try for horror. He goes for action and he fails at that too. The problem is, this is a director who simply doesn't know how to make a movie. What's the movie about? I'll tell you. There's this super woman, this group of people, a mad scientist and a monster guy and they all run around shooting stuff. There, you don't need to see it now. My favorite scene is when this super sexed up cop enters a room with a little girl and there are zombies in the room and the girl is scared but the cop says not to worry because the zombies are slow and they can just run right around them. HAHAHAHA! That takes any kind of threat out of zombies right there. End the movie now. But no. It drags on through this plot that makes absolutely no sense. Somebody explain to me what the point is of scientists making two monster people and making them battle each other. There's no suspense in this movie, no drama, horrible acting, so-so special effects and no story what so ever.<br /><br />And it's sad because the Resident Evil games are known to be the scariest games out there. So what the heck is up with this movie?
B0002UXBD6|5.0|This, by far, has to be Green Day's best album to date.  I was very surprised at just how much this band has grown and matured over the years.  I must admit that I haven't listened to them in quite a long while, but when I heard \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\", I was instantly hooked and had to have the album.  That song has to be one of the best of 2004, and its lyrics are so meaningful and timely.  Once I got the album, I listened to it all the way through and discovered that this band has some real talent, and I am glad to see them heading the charts again.  It is great to see a group bounce into the spotlight (the Dookie-era), take a break and do albums that support their fan base (albums after Insomniac), and then return to the spotlight with a changed feel and attitude (American Idiot).  What I thought was a band on the edge of the downward spiral has actually reinvented themselves, and it is a great thing.  I hope to hear more great things from these guys in the future...and as for now...I will keep listening to AMERICAN IDIOT!!
0679722610|5.0|This is my favorite of the Continental Op stories.  The basic conceit is quite clever and original.  It has been much imitated in the movies, e.g. Yojimbo and one of the Sergio Leone movies.
B00009L1OB|3.0|By the time this album was released, I was in the depths of my Duran Duran depravity. I was about 12 maybe and I LIVED for Duran Duran (remember those years??). My room was covered (literally every wall) with pictures and posters of the fab 5. I had the buttons all over my super cool jean jacket (gag!! What was I thinking). Anyway, I hadnt listened to this album for YEARS until I found all my old records (yes, records) and tapes. I put this one on and was sucked back into a teenage time warp (I even got some instant pimples and was angry at my mother for a few minutes). Compared to RIO this album is too 'Pop' but it's still good. I cant really be negative about anything Duran Duran put out when I was young because it had such a HUGE impact on my entire life back then. After listening to 'Seven and the ragged Tiger' again (20rs later) I didnt find it quite as thriling as I did when I was 12. However, it's still a decent piece of work. They were really heavily into keyboards on this album (not as badly as 'Girls on Film') but the guitar playing is much more pronounced then on earlier releases. My favorite songs on this album are \\"New Moon on Monday\\" 'Union of the Snake\\" and \\"The Reflex\\"
B0006A9FMI|5.0|Saturday, January 01, 2005 / 5 of 5 / Dense, complex, and beautiful.<br />Once again we have an excellent addition to the Ghost in the Shell cannon joining the original, and the stand alone Complex versions.  This anime has a dense and complex thematic plot, bringing philosophical questions of identity and self again to the forefront as cyborg agent Batou must investigate the mysterious malfunctioning and suicides of beautiful doll like mecha children.  Aiding him whenever he enters the Net is the first film's Major whose ghost has gone on to merge with the Puppet Master  into the electronic web.  While the story is slow to unfold, its intellectual dialogue and mystical quality is marvelously paired with the CG effects, the 2d animation, and the haunting score.  For those who can appreciate a good winding story, this is an excellent thinking man's anime. Highly recommended.<br /><br />[Update 2/10/17]: The newly released Blu-ray is sumptuous in its presentation, the warm color timings and effects are just gorgeous in high def. My feelings about the story haven't changed since I last viewed and reviewed this 12 years ago, heh.  Very dialogue dense with episodic action; it's a bit different than any of the other entries in the mythos.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Tupac Shakur was a poet. HE WAS THE GREATEST RAP ARTIST OF ALL TIME. This album is classic. ABSOLUTELY worthy of a five star rating. The beats are hot and you already know about Pac's lyrics. He shouldn't have had any guest appearances on this album cuz Pac just kills em. Meth and Snoop and Red, etc. all come off sounding like amateurs. Pac wasnt murdered, he was assassinated.
B00005RDSM|4.0|Yes, there IS a scene missing from the 1953 Disney movie!  We watched it again recently after seeing \\"Finding Neverland\\".  I was waiting for the \\"if you believe in fairies, clap your hands!\\" part (my favorite moment in the original film), but IT NEVER CAME!  What is Disney thinking???!!!  Does anyone know if the unedited original is available for sale anywhere?
B000002LCX|4.0|Aside from \\"The Queen is Dead\\" this is the best Smiths album. Great production and great lyrics. This album gets no respect from other Smiths fans, and I've never been able to figure out why. I think it's close to being \\"five\\" stars. If you're new to the Smiths, I would satrt with \\"The Queen Is Dead.\\" I like all the songs on this album, no favorite.
B00008EY65|4.0|When I first saw the trailer to this film, i admit i turned my nose up at it. It looked to be another one of those stupid, over the top, CGI overboard movies. I ignored it completly when it came out in theatres.<br /><br />I only watched it on a rainy day when I had nothign better to do, and nothing better to watch. (my old man bought it if you care) and to my suprise, the movie was absolutly nothing like I thought it would be. It was the complete opisote!<br /><br />I wasnt expecting anything but something i'd eventualy turn off after a while, but it was not boring or turning me off with over-used CGI or corney little things that dont make sense or are put there for no reason. I had no idea what comic book the movie was based on, i'd never heard of Hellboy.

B000007WNN|5.0|This is quite possibly THE GREATEST hard rock album of all time. Every song on this album is great. To use an old cliche, it's a \\"timeless classic.\\"  The Cult totally rocked on this album. Ian Astbury's voice is like a primal scream while the guitars are fierce and almost terrifying at times. ELECTRIC is on my list of greatest rock albums of all time. Period. TEN STARS
B000001DTM|5.0|You probably already own this album. If not, you're probably familiar with most of the excellent songs within it because of the huge amount of airplay and media coverage it deservedly generated. If you're not, you may be from another planet. Welcome. <br /> <br />Achtung Baby sees U2 turn away from America and embrace Europe, as well as the darker side of life (at least that's my impression). It's an impaccably produced collection of beautiful classic rock songs that sounds as good today as when it was released. <br /> <br />Sure, rock bohemoths generally aren't cool, but you can't let the fact that your dad likes U2 - or that this album has probably come as standard with every new VW Golf for the past ten years - put you off. Whether your CD collection has more Deftones than Dire Straits, this still deserves to be within it. <br /> <br />When released, a new generation of rockers were taking the world by storm with their grunge sound. But rather than sound bloated and 80s due to Achtung Baby's impeccable production, the ingenuity of the layered and fresh/original sounds, The Edge's swathes of slashing guitar, and quality of the songs meant U2 proved themselves as relevant as ever. And of the 1990s, only a handful of albums, of which this is one, have stood the test of time - unlike, say, Radiohead's OK Computer, which was hailed as revolutionary but has been very much overshadowed by Radiohead's subsequent output. U2 by contrast have come close to Achtung Baby's brilliance on a few tracks since, but in terms of producing another album so perfect, cohesive and complete? Nein. <br /> <br />I would suggest that if you are a fan of rock and/or popular music, this is one of those must-own albums you hear so much about! The good thing about this one is you'll want to own it - and play it regularly - until you get old and start liking Cliff Richard and Classic FM. <br /> <br />Oh and by the way, if Bono's posturing and his band's recent jumping aboard the iPod corporate brandwagon annoys you as it does me, well, this album excuses all that. Seriously, it does. And that's saying something.
B000002U84|5.0|After all these years, I still love this album. This was the first \\"record\\" I ever purchased when I was young. I believe it came out in 1982, so I was a mere 10 (my GOD....am I really THAT old??!). Anyway, this is a beautiful album. It had the popular songs \\"Rio\\" and \\"Hungry LIke the Wolf\\" which were also some of the first videos ever aired on MTV. My favorite songs on 'Rio\\" are \\"Save a Prayer\\", \\"New Religion\\" and \\"Lonely in Your Nightmare.\\" Simon LeBon never sounds better than on this album. An almost perfect piece of work for Duran Duran before they became TOO popular.  On my list of all time great albums.
B00000DP01|5.0|The first time I bought a 'real Genesis album,' the CD was \\"Nursery Cryme\\" & I did not know what to expect.  I was hoping to hear cuts like \\"Abacab\\" or stuff from \\"The Numbers Album,\\" or \\"Duke.\\" Was I in for a rude awakening!  It was late June, early July 1995, I was 17 years old.  I just finished up my junior year at East Detroit High School & was over a month away from beginning my final year as a Senior in High School.  At that time, Green Day's 'Dookie'(released 'Insomiac' in 1995), Soundgarden's 'Superunknown', Pearl Jam's 'Vitalogy', & Alice In Chain's 'Jar Of Flies' were the albums that were the order of the day.  People were still trembling from Kurt Corbain's apparent suicide a year later.  The Eagles were on a comeback tour.  The Smashing Pumpkins would release the double album, 'Meloncholy & The Infinate Sadness' that year.  Korn & Rage Against The Machine came out of nowhere.  The Red Hot Chili Peppers released 'One Hot Minute' which was a departure from their previous albums.  However, Alternative/Grunge was at it's final death stages at this time (but we didn't know it then).  1995 was also the year of the Page/Plant Unledded show on MTV which was huge!  The O.J. Simpson trial was still lingering in the presence of the media circus.  Pantera's 1992 album, 'Vulgar Display of Power' was the album to have (if you didn't have that album in high school, you were considered that something was wrong with you).  The beginning of New Year's Day, 1995 marked the 10 month countdown to the Beatles Anthology special on ABC.  Z-Rock was THE radio station.  Flannel, band shirts & faded different coloured jeans with sneakers or military boots & long hair was the fashion as well.   <br /> <br />And so here I am at Record Time on 10 Mile & Gratiot (They now moved to 11 & Gratiot), buying a CD.  When I saw \\"Nursery Cryme\\" I was like \\"What is this?  An album cover with a Victorian Nurse w/ a mallet in her hands & severed heads on the ground?  Interesting.\\"  I bought it for 10 dollars & took it home for a listen.  Now mind you, I didn't even hear a note on this album at all....yet.  Thinking that it would be only Phil Collins, Tony Banks & Michael Rutherford on this album, I was in for another surprise:  \\"Peter Gabriel was in Genesis?\\"  I said to myself. \\"And who's Steve Hackett?  Oh this I have to listen to.\\"  The first song I played was of course, \\"The Musical Box.\\"  Right from those beginning chords, the song was like 'the performance had already started & we the listener have arrived late to the concert' type of feel.  It was unusual listening to Peter Gabriel singing in Genesis (I was familar w/\\"Shock The Monkey\\", \\"In Your Eyes\\", \\"Sledgehammer\\"....but then again I was a sucker & naive in what to believe).  When the quiet slumbers turned into explosive blasts from Rutherford's 12 String Rickenbacker & when Hackett's Gibson Les Paul comes flying in like a bottle rocket, my jaw hit the floor!  I never heard anyone solo that different in my life.  Let's just say that my life had changed forever.  Now enough of my life story, let's go through all the songs. <br /> <br />THE MUSICAL BOX:  This song is exactly like the tune \\"Stagnation\\" from their second album, \\"TRESPASS.\\"  However, with newcomers, Drummer Phil Collins & Guitarist Steve Hackett, it becomes immediately known that the final 2 pieces of the puzzle are finally in place & the 'Class of 1971' lineup is now complete.  A somber tale about 'Old King Cole' as Gabriel desperately wants to be touched \\"NOW, NOW, NOW, NOW, NOW!\\" behind the roaring of Tony Banks' Hammond Organ L122 & Hackett's mournful outro solo. <br /> <br />FOR ABSENT FRIENDS:  This is where Phil Collins makes his first lead vocal debut (Not \\"More Fool Me\\" from \\"SELLING ENGLAND BY THE POUND\\").  Phil's 'sensitive voice to 12-string guitar' was beautiful in blending his voice w/ the acoustic about 2 widowed ladies remembering about their lost loved husbands while going to church.  The song title itself would be an errie forshadowing of what was to come within a few years down the road with this band.   <br /> <br />THE RETURN OF THE GIANT HOGWEED:  The title itself is hilarious when I first saw the name of this song.  The opening of this tune was like a hogweed dancing through a distorted swriling pattern behind Hackett's fuzzed Les Paul & Banks' distorted Hohner electric piano.  The song was based on an actual newspaper article when hogweeds were 'spreading' in English countryside.  Gabriel has some unusual lines in this song like \\"They all need the sun to photosensitive their venom\\" and \\"They all are inmune to all our herbicidal batterings.\\"  Hackett's guitar tone is almost like an army of hogweeds that are \\"threatening the human race.\\"  Phil Collins tries to slash on through behind his Gretsch drumkit, but there is no hope-THE GIANT HOGWEED LIVES! <br /> <br />SEVEN STONES:  A dreary tale about an old man who makes a living on greed & chance.  Here's where Tony Banks' Mellotron MK II makes its presence adding more to the mournful landscape.  When you hear this song, sit back, close your eyes, and hear \\"the old man tell his tale.\\" <br /> <br />HAROLD THE BARREL:  Here's where everyone, except Hackett but he makes his Black Beauty Les Paul sound voicelike, joins in on vocals.  Here's where Peter Gabriel's dark disgusting sense of humor comes in.  A quick story about a restarunt owner who flees & tries to leave town for 'cutting off his toes & serving them for tea.' Once the angry people surround Harold in a house, he threatens to 'take a running jump' from the upstairs of the house.  His mother is brought in she begs Harold not to jump because \\"His shirt is all dirty & there's a man here from the BBC.\\"  This song could've been processed as a rock opera for it was a funny story. <br /> <br />HARLEQUIN:  Another pretty song on this album where Phil & Peter take the lead on this one where 'all is not lost'.  The tune has a hint of Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young in a way, but still worth listening to.   <br /> <br />THE FOUNTAIL OF SALMACIS:  This was the song that really sold me.  If there was one way to end this album this was the way.  As the Hammond Organ & the Mellotron plays call & response in the opening of this tune Gabriel tells the tale of Hermophidites.  Hackett & Banks once again develope their musical swriling patterns that would eventually become a trademark of Genesis.  Lastly, the way this song ends the album, no other band created such an atmospheric ending to a wonderful album even before or after.   <br /> <br />THE MUSICAL BOX & THE RETURN OF THE GIANT HOGWEED sound even better in the 1973 \\"LIVE\\" album.  THE FOUNTAIN OF SALMACIS & the other 2 mentioned songs are also great when Genesis was on Belgian TV in 1972, otherwise known as \\"THE WHITE ROOM SESSIONS.\\" <br /> <br />This is a great album from start to finish eventhough it's just over 39 minutes, but well worth it.  For me, it finally grew on me & it was because of this album, it was the beginning of exploring progressive rock & the end of listening to 90's music, and mind you, this is coming from a 26 year old who 'shouldn't be listening to this.'
B0002OERI0|1.0|Okay, the cd is not THAT bad.  But green day has lost whatever it was that made them green day in the first place.  They dont have the attitude anymore, they dont play music that defines them.  Its like they did this because they realized they needed to do something different to get noticed.  And hey, they achieved that, so good for them.  But for people like me, who appreciated who they were before, and now have to deal with it playing on every radio station and channel on tv atthe same time until I want to blow my head off, its not so good.  Listen to some real \\"concept albums\\" done by some real bands, and see what musical genius is. Just cuz MTV says theyre gods now doesnt mean that they are. Calm down people.
B00005NTJK|5.0|Tull's second album is as good as any album Tull has ever done. Very rootsy. It's an amazing and unique blend of blues and English folk that I can play over and over and over. It also contains one of my all-time favorite bass solos in the Bach inspired piece Bouree by Glen Cornick. The one thing missing from the original album is the very cool gatefold jacket with the pop-up representation of the band. Overall a gem and one of my favorite albums of all-time.
B00005JN0T|4.0|i was expecting a no point action movie but this movie wasn't that. It is also visualy beautiful.
B00005NWLO|5.0|This is one of my top 5 live albums of all-time and what a great job MCA did in packaging this. They updated the concert by including two songs that weren't on the original album, Simple Man and Gimme Back My Bullets. It also includes 8 alternate versions of songs already on the album. It's totally remastered. It includes a 28 page booklet with some very interesting liner notes. One item I found particularly interesting was how Tuesday's Gone was the last choice of what the band wanted to perform but Tom Dowd insisted that they try playing it. The man had good instincts. Also, on the original Freebird, Allen Collins was unhappy with his live solo, so he took it back to the studio and did 29 takes before he finally overdubbed a new solo. When they were putting this new recording together, they couldn't find the tape with Collins' solos so they had no choice but to release the never-before-heard original Freebird. In addition to some great photos, this package also includes all the original photos as well as Cameron Crowe's original liner notes.
0780020693|3.0|im sorry, but i disagree a little with everyone out there. i mean, i recognize some merits in this film, the structure is splendid, its a film bout the town as a character rather than a person or gruop. but theres something about it i dont like. its really naive (too naive sometimes) and really pretty. Antonioni once said that every good story is about something \\"bad\\", sufferting or something like that. Amarcord is about people being happy for two hours. and when theyre not, everything is filmed in a happy manner. sorry, but i cant like this film (altough the scene of the family at lunch is superb)
B000002VMD|5.0|This is \\"a Whitney CD\\". No doubt about it. Despite Lisa's, Kenny G's efforts...Whitney reigns supreme in this soundtrack. <br />There will never be a singer as she is.... for me that's crystal clear.
0671027387|3.0|Mr. Brown's entire structure of this book is plot, plot, and plot.  Everything is said for a reason, and every character development is done to drive the plot forward.  It's about action and it's about suspense and if you feel like you've read this type of book before, don't feel bad -- you have!<br /><br /> Rachel Sexton is the protagonist who uncovers a deception in a recent NASA discovery and of course encounters a rising body count, action sequences that are on the verge of laughable, along with astonishing lucky breaks that save her neck.  Senator Sexton is her father, with a one-dimensional desire for power using the destruction of NASA as his abortion issue that gets everyone riled up and drives the polls in his favor.  Rachel of course hates her father, and what he represents, but that relationship goes undeveloped because she needs to focus on saving her life which seems to be an ongoing dilemma.  If she isn't drowning, she's being shot at or directly attacked or must endure more drowning.  She drowns a lot in this book but must save all in uncovering this crisis and save NASA and the President and get a love interest.  Whew, she's a busy woman!<br /><br /> In the end everything wraps up along with the required love scene as well as the \\"everything is fine now\\" sequence.<br /><br /> Of course I'm a bit hard on this.  The pace is great and Brown works hard not to reveal too much to keep your curiousity up.  The pages turn quickly and the plot is engaging albeit ridiculous at points.<br /><br />  My biggest complaint is the handling of NASA.  NASA being both a military and science organization who spends a lot of its money handling spy satellite payload is given a unfair head banging.  Yes they are not perfect and yes they are unfocused and every mistake they make is headline news, but remember their achievments never get ANY attention at all and they are plentiful.  Plus they're cheap.  Social security and the military are significantly more expensive for the government.  Get the facts right Dan.<br /><br />  So if you're looking to not think too much and just enjoy a James Bond type adventure check this out.  If you are looking for hard science fiction with complex characters read Issac Asimov or Ben Bova.  Nuff said!et the facts right Dan.   <br />  So if you're looking to not think too much and just enjoy a James Bond type adventure check this out.

B00030590I|2.0|I waited excitedly for another Jet Li movie to come out.  After looking at this movie, I was very disappointed.  The same killing scene kept repeating iteself. I didnt like the movie at all.  I wanted my money back.  I am a big Jet Li fan.  Hopefully his future films will be much better.
B000255LNE|5.0|I remember listening to I Can't Stop Loving You when I broke up with a boyfriend and my world was rocked. I grew up and realized that I was just being a romantic fool. Guess what? We're playing Phil at our wedding many eons of years later. And a friend I met at a Phil Collins/Billy Joel online fan club is one of my brides maids!
B0001VWP8I|5.0|Anastacia is one of those rare artists that boasts her unique voice and makes every song bend to her bidding. She is one of those artists that you'd like to see try various styles of music... her last two albums explored pop, dance, and R&B and this album lands her in a mine field of explosive rock and anthemic choruses.  <br />Right away, with \\"Seasons Change\\" this album kicks off into high gear via an array of heavy electric guitar riffs. Once she sings, the dreaded feeling that this will be a horrible album tinged yet again by Miss Lavignes influences, is washed away as it becomes clear that her voice was made for this sound.  <br />\\"Left Outside Alone\\" Was my favorite song before I bought the album but because I wore out the single I bought, it kind of got overplayed my my own foolish desires. Ha ha... but this song is truly killer material and she belts out so lively... you feel her emotion as she belts out what her emotions are.  <br />\\"Time\\" is a gorgeous song. Simple yet up tempo and and then rocking out for the chorus, this is a song so aptly suited for her voice.  <br />\\"Sick and Tired\\" is so beautifully grafted. It is rock sounding but the addition of a man singing reggae style is intriguing and adds an interesting twist to the song.  <br />\\"Heavy On My Heart\\" is one of the better ballads out on the scene right now. Anastacia has some heavy duty power vocals. <br />\\"I Do\\" which features Sonny of P.O.D, opens with a guitar riff that is indicative of an arabic sound... and has a crafty, errie effect. The song is like an anthem... with a wonderful meaning. The sound compliments her voice and the song has a slight evanesence feel thanks to the vocal contribution of Sonny. <br />Skipping the next three songs, \\"Welcome To My Truth\\", \\"Pretty Little Dum Dum\\", and \\"Sexy Single\\", which are good but not as good as the others on this CD, I move onto the next standout. \\"Rearview\\" sort of starts out like Celine Dions version of \\"I Drove All Night\\" but it stops with thebeat. The song is about realizing that it is too late to go back and fix the mistakes made in love.  <br />\\"Where Do I Belong\\" is powerful and has a zinger of a message. It depends on how you would interpret it, but I take it as she is uncertain where she fits in to the scheme of life and she doesn't like other people forcing their beliefs on her. Very personal and powerful stuff. <br />\\"Maybe Today\\" Is my favorite song on the album. It is slow, piano driven, and lyrically complimenting to Anastacias voice. This song is like a second pard to \\"Where Do I Belong\\" but this one is more about being free and united with others in unity. Pretty... and it affects me personaly. <br /> <br />This is a wonderful album. Instead of feeling the need to skip through to find my favorite songs like on the other albums she has done, I can listen to this one straight through. Her voice satisfies throughout and I was so glad that I found this CD even though it is not readily available in the States. It needs to be... out youn pop divas in training could use some lessons from a woman who knows how to make the music reveal her... emotions and other things that music is meant to do.
0887306667|5.0|For someone who does not have an MBA, and knows very little about business, this was the best book I ever read for giving me the most insight into what I should/should not do in my business.  I have recommended this book to every other entrepreneur that I know, and keep it on my desk as one of the \\"must have references\\" for my business.  While the stories may seem outdated, the principals are still true today. My favorites are \\"The Law of the Category\\", \\"The Law of the Mind\\", The Law of Duality,\\" and \\"The Law of Division.\\" I have used some of the \\"laws\\" with many a client and gotten them to see that their planned road of marketing was not the right road.  You must buy this book!

B0002OERI0|5.0|American idiot was the first Green day Cd I bought. I am also convinced that is the greatest punk album ever. It Deserves to stand right next to the Whos Quadrophenia and tommy.A modern Classic. No songs dissapoint my personal favorites are the 9 minute long Jesus of suburbia  Homecoming whatsername  Holiday  Boulavard of broken dreams and letterbomb. This album is a rock Opera following the story of Jesus of suburbia.if you dont already own this album and you remotly like any type of rock you should buy this album and if you dont you should still buy it. american idiot- <br />9/10 probably the weakest track on the album and over played but still awsome <br />Jesus of suburbia-10/10 my favorite song jesus is introduced best part city of the damned Holiday-10/10 another awsome number with very political lyrics <br />Boulevard of broken dreams-10/10 the second single (american idiot was fist) <br />Are we Waiting-10/10 not as strong as the others but still great <br />St. Jimmy-10/10 a faster song that sounds more like older green day st. jimmy introduced   Give me Novacaine-10/10 another classic song   Shes a rebel-10/10 whatsername introduced   extrodanary girl-10/10 another song about whatsername <br />Letterbomb10/10 just listen to the song it will blow you away   wake me up when semptemper ends-10/10 a song thats a little depressing but great homecoming-another 9 minute song the weaker of the two but still incredible <br />Whatsername-10/10 A song that is sad a awsome conculsion to an album in my opinion deservses a place next to classics like let it bleed paranoid Quadrephina Santana III Appetite for destruction Abbey Road and blonde on blonde.

B000669GAI|5.0|I only started listening to Pearl Jam 6 months ago, but since then they have become my favorite band.  I now own all of their albums.     <br />People may complain that some of their favoirtes were not on this disk but it is still a good compilation of their most popular songs.  I am still waiting for Nirvana liek box set that Pearl Jam releases.  I was glad to see that there were some previously unreleased songs on this album, such as State of Trust and Love, Breath and Man of the Hour.
0142437611|5.0|This is a good book to read in one sitting after you've had a horrible day and you are seeking to feel good about yourself. The story is about a forty something year-old Tommy Wilhem who looses his job and refuses to take any responsibility for his misfortunes. He is a loser by our society standards. He moves into a hotel, expects his father the notorious Dr. Adler to pay his rent while he gambles his money, pays no attention to his physical appearance, and indulges on alcohol and pills. Neither son nor father can sympathize for each other. Tommy blames his father for not supporting him, and father is disappointed that his son didn't follow the notion of the \\"American Dream\\", by choosing a lucrative career path such as that of becoming a doctor, and instead chose an untraditional route that of becoming and actor. However, Dr. Adler is a stubborn man that believes that his son should own up to his mistakes and get a  job, but at the same time he lies to his friends at the hotel about how well his son Tommy is doing business wise. There is a an intriguing element of illusion and reality in this work as Dr. Adler gives himself a false sense of relief my masking the truth that he himself as a father is not a failure, and neither is his son.
B00000J7J4|2.0|this is ok for a quick listen, but its nothing compared to santana's earlier albums. people who like modern pop will like this, but longtime santana fans will be disapointed his music is diluted with pop culture singers.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I loved these films growing up (as most people did), and I was disappointed by the 1997 re-releases.  But these new changes really take the cake; over-dubbing Jeremy Bulloch's dialogue as Boba Fett with a very flat sounding Temuera Morrison ruined ESB for me, and RotJ just isn't the same for me anymore without the Ewok song at the end.  Plus replacing Anakin at the ending is just plain insulting. <br /> <br />Maybe one day George Lucas will come around and give the fans what they want; the original movies!
B00005JNLY|2.0|The title of this review is advice that works on several levels.  In my case, I was enthusiastic about seeing Spanglish and my wife was not.  We went, bad decision.  In the case of the movie, Adam Sandler is America's greatest working chef -- hey, I didn't believe it either, but the New York Times review everyone reads hungrily in the movie says so -- and St. John to everyone (and especially Flor and his daughter Bernice, particularly well-played by Sarah Steele) but his wife with whom he never talks.  Now admittedly she is bipolar -- half the time a harping shrew and the other half some sort of New Age physical fitness addict who constantly screams \\"Left, left\\" to people she is passing as she jogs, as if they're going to commit some kamikaze leap into her path.  One hopes Tea Leoni has replaced the agent who steered her to this part, where among other things she is required to be made up to look like a 20 years younger version of Hillary Clinton.  <br /> <br />And why is this movie so interminably long, over two hours to reach its two banal lessons -- 1) be true to your roots and 2) you need to work continually at your relationship.  Which leads back to ... pay attention to your spouse/partner if s/he says not to see this movie.
0060594888|5.0|Jack has brilliantly blended all of the key elements for a successful life into one magnificent book. Combining supporting stories and action steps, The Success Principle provides a clear pathway to certain success for anyone who chooses to follow it. One of the best books I've ever read. Canfield has outdone himself. Bravo!
B0001BKAEY|5.0|I will begin by saying that the first movie is the classical one that started it all, Matrix Reloaded wasn't THAT good because there is not much action with guns but there are many fight scenes with martial arts, Matrix Revolutions is my personal favorite.  <br />Here are the pros. and conts. <br /> <br />Good: <br />* PERFECT special effects mixing with EXPLOSIVE ACTION!!! <br />* AMAZING cinematography. <br />* AWESOME opera song in the final battle. <br />* Great acting. <br />* This is the best movie-parody of japanese animation in the trilogy: This one contains the dark setting desing of AKIRA and FINAL FANTASY 7, the battle war of ROBOTECH MACROSS and TECKNOMAN, the fight scene of DRAGONBALL Z and X THE MOVIE, and the suspensfully insane ending of END OF EVANGELION and AKIRA (look alike). <br /> <br />Bad: <br />* There are only three long and memorable action scenes. <br />* The bullets of hand-guns were not shot in slow motion close-up cameras. <br /> <br />P.S: I am NOT a fan of Matrix but I am a HARDCORE fan of Anime and that was the main reason that I bought this movie. <br /> <br />adios.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|This is an excellent boxed set at an excellent price. <br /> <br />Granted, it is not for everyone. Personally, I enjoy DVD \\"making-of\\" special featurettes and cast commentary. Since a majority of the discs included are just that, I would only recommend this boxed set for those who enjoy seeing the inner workings of film-making and it's special effects. However, even if you only liked 2 of the movies, this boxed set more than makes up for that with it's price of about $6 per disc. <br /> <br />Everyone rips on the Matrix Trilogy as being a let down; The truth is that even Reloaded and Revolutions are better than 90% of the Science Fiction movies released in the past decade. Don't believe me? Look at such crapfests as Battlefield Earth, Jason X, Timeline, etc. <br /> <br />Bottom line: If you're a fan of good science fiction movies and the intricacies therein, this boxed set is a steal.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|Through all of the band's many changes this show puts the best foot forward.  From the vocals being on key and not strained throughout all songs, to the more upbeat, quicker rhythm of Chris Slade's drums, this was AC/DC's finest moment as a rock band.  All of their other videos do not come close.  Check out the audience during the first song, Thunderstruck.  It's a mass of people just jumping up and down in waves - definitely pulse popping.  Awesome all the way through.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I consider this the best Z-movie I've seen for plenty of reasons.  The main one, though, is because the story makes a serious effort to show many, if not all, of the zombies before their reanimation.  E.g., carefully watch the opening sequence and you'll see part of what I mean. <br /> <br />And the dry British humor is inescapable.  The funniest scene has to be when they're \\"dealing with\\" the zombied pub owner all to the beat of a Queen song.  Genius.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I am a teenage girl who rented this movie to watch with my family. My cousins had said that it was funny, but I was doubtful because they are strange. Anywho, I was laughing the whole time. Now, my family and I cannot stop quoting this film. I think they picked awesome actors to be in this movie. My favorite quote was, \\"Tina, come get some ham!\\" I would buy this product if it wasn't $20.99, but I will wait until I have more money to spare. If you ask me if this movie was good, my reply would be, \\"heck yes, it was!\\"
B0002OERI0|4.0|Hey, big Republican, conservative, Bush supporting so and so here. I just mention that because I don't buy CD's to hear a bold political message, I listen to be entertained. <br /> Nothing offensive here, just an incredible CD, one of the best I've ever heard, I just can't seem to take it out of my player. <br />\\"American Idiot\\" gets it going.  Catchy tune that draws you in quickly, \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" is the best, man over 9 minutes of song and not long enough. <br />I've never been huge in to Green Day, now that I've heard this, I've got to go back and find all their stuff.  Surely it can't match this but we'll see. <br />I could go on and on trying to come up with intellegent and well-spoken reasons to buy this. Nah.  It's just good, so just listen!! <br /> <br />
B000002KD9|5.0|I had been trying desperately to get into Neil Young, but I never seemed to understand what he was going for, sampling material from every facet of his career...then I picked this up the other day and all I have been listening to is any Neil Young I can find in my sloppy record collection...This man is...well...he's Neil...The songs are so sparse, there's really so little to it, but so much to be gained from hearing this music...and his voice...I love bad singers...Dylan, John Mayall, Tom Verlaine (not the same caliber, but I couldn't think of anyone else right now)...His voice is so melancholy and almost innocent...It really seems like the songs are built around his voice, but that's not a real valid point...I don't know the man's process, I just know the results are breathtakingly beautiful, poignantly insightful (if you are, like I'm told I am, a gloomy person, just pick up almost anything from this period in his work and you'll find something there), and they give me a feeling of great appreciation that this man has lent us his art throughout the years...Keep searchin, Neil, keep searchin...   ps  I hate writing reviews, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity here...don't mind me....
0793518326|1.0|That's about what you need to read this book.  I was so geeked up because here I read all these great reviews about this book, obviously by Beatle lovers as myself, but what a dissappointment!  The writing is sooooooooooooooo small you need a magnifying glass to see the tablature.  Do yourself a favor if it's looking for good, I mean GOOD Beatle tablature, get the Complete Beatles volumes 1 & 2.  A lot cheaper than this book and much, much easier to read!
B0007TKNIS|3.0|I was impressed by the film--the new elements added to the story worked very well. This is one production where Joel Schumacher's penchant for overdone set pieces actually works. I've seen the stage version twice (and listened to the London recording countless times) and was apprehensive about the casting of the Phantom (Gerald Butler). His voice is offputting at first, but not bad--he simply sounds so different from the soundtrack we've all been listening to since 1988 that it comes as a shock when you first hear him. By the end of the film I'd accepted his singing and enjoyed his rendition of \\"Past the Point of No Return.\\" For \\"Music of the Night,\\" Crawford is still the definitive voice of the Phantom in my mind. My wife, however, who has never liked the singing of Michael Crawford, bought this soundtrack because she thought Butler was better. On this issue, it is a matter of taste.  <br /> <br />Now for the worst element of the film, the point where it was almost ruined for me as a moviegoer--the Phantom's make-up when unmasked. Did they run out of money at this point? Whoever was responsible for the design of this Phantom's face should be ashamed. It looks like a bad skin condition that a good scrubbing would take care of, not a facial deformity. Close-up photos of Crawford's 1988 stage make-up are more convincing and far scarier. Also questionable was the use of lighting in the Phantom's lair--there is no mystery with everything so bright (also there was very little \\"mist upon the vast glassy lake\\"). The tendency of Schumacher to have the Phantom's shirt open 3/4 of the time makes him seem less mysterious, far too human, and more like a lounge singer from the 1970s (like a costume from Three's Company). With the Phantom costume choices I really don't think Schumacher knew what he was doing (very much like putting nipples on the Batman costume)--he ruined the Red Death costume at the Masked Ball. And what was with the break-dancing? This made the scene laughablewhen viewing it now--how will it look ten years from now? Again, a good film, but it could have been great with a director who was willing to respect what worked in the presentations of the material that preceded his own.  <br /> <br />
B000053V7O|5.0|It's been more than 18 years since I watched this film and I've not come across a better jazz singer than Lonette McKee ever since! Her performance of Gershwin's 'How Long Has This Been Going On' alone is worth everything and more. It is hauntingly beautiful.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I was pleased to finally get the trilogy on DVD after watching it for years on VHS.  While they have restored the colour and improved the sound, I was disappointed in the additional CG scenes they added which I felt didn't add anything to the film just added minutes. But I was even more frustrated when they completely changed one of the characters in the final scene of Return of the Jedi where Obi, Yoda and Annakin appear.  Instead of the older actor who played Darth when his mask is removed they superimposed a young Annakin.  It would have been nice if they had included untouched versions of these scenes as additional footage so at least we can see how it originally was.
0385513755|4.0|Don't let the size of the book intimatdate you, the 400 something pages go by very fast. The amount you pay for the book(around 22$, hardcover) is worth it. Its the type of book where you want to be right on it looking for clues and trying to solve it yourself. The beginning is as shocking as the end, and its a great book for older aldults and middle age kids. It includes tons of history mixed in with a plot, and has become very popular with readers. I am recomending this book to all readers, and to go out and grab it, may be a great gift for friends and family.
1400032717|5.0|You've probably been recommended this book by at least two people and the good news is: they're right. They were completely wrong to recommend you `Vernon God Little', mind, but that's another story... When I was a teacher in an American high school we had a half-day training from the special needs department on Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism. Kids with Asperger's are often very high-functioning, smart kids, but are unable to relate to other people and have an extremely hard time understanding metaphors, sarcasm and facial expressions. We were taught how to adapt our classes if we had a kid with this condition in class. Had this book been written at the time it would have been a perfect introduction to understanding this fascinating mindset and learning about the daily struggles these kids, and their guardians, face.<br /><br />Christopher is the `gifted', teenaged narrator of this story which starts with the murder of their neighbour's dog. He sets out to investigate who killed it and along the way learns family secrets and travels far outside of his usual comfort zone. His strangely ordered thinking and lack of shades of grey in his emotions make his narration unique. His reasoning is impeccable but weird and even the most mundane goings-on are rendered bizarre through Christopher's eyes. The more red cars he sees in a row on the way to school, the better day he'll have and if he sees yellow cars, then he won't talk, eat or communicate with anyone for potentially days. He wont't eat any food if it touches a different food on his plate yet he can do all the Rain Man mathematical tricks.<br /><br />At one stage, he ends up going on a solo journey, recording people's bewildered reactions to him as he goes. As a reader, you're caught up in worrying about him and at the same time amused at the gentle fish-out-of-water comedy that will be familiar to you if you've read Iain Banks' `Whit' which has a naïve but preternaturally smart member of a Scottish cult leaving home for the first time to complete a holy mission in the outside world.<br /><br />The lack of verbiage and insistence of the plot makes this highly readable. It's a great read for a plane or train journey, or maybe even a long tube ride if you skip the mathematical sidetracks. If you know someone with this condition or are likely to encounter someone in your profession, you'll gain a lot of insight through this well researched and gripping novel. Even if you don't, you'll enjoy your travels with Christopher and maybe pick up some 'A'-Level maths along the way.eaving home for the first time to complete a holy mission in the outside world. <br /> <br />The lack of verbiage and insistence of the plot makes this highly readable.

B00005JMUL|5.0|Oh to be a child again.  The Polar Express was indeed the most enchanting movie I've seen in years.  Yes, if you grew believing in Santa Claus and Christmas this movie is definitely a treat.  It has all the fixings of a holiday movies that follows in the same vane as \\"A Miracle on 34th Street\\" as well as other Christmas tinged films, such as \\"A Christmas Story\\" that provide a sense of child-like nostalgia that might date back Christmas memories of the 1930s, 40s, or 50s.  Also, the film carries on the tradition of Clement Moore's \\"'Twas the Night Before Christmas\\".<br /><br />The animation is excellent and effective.  The computer graphics provide one romp of a ride on the Polar Express that simulates a disney-like quality like riding on the matterhorn.  And the film soundtrack isn't bad at all -- what would a Christmas film be without Kate Smith, Bing Crosby, Perry Como and host others singing those beloved tunes like \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\\" or \\"Jingle Bells?\\"  And for those rockers out there, Steven Tyler of Aerosmith adds a little raunchy tune that'll keep the elves jumpin' and jivin'.<br /><br />So grab a seat, savor some hot cocoa, or simply watch the film and become enchanted with one great movie that won't leave the child in you disappointed.
B0002X314C|5.0|This album is a MUST HAVE.  It's not worth categorizing, because this record to me transcends classification.  However, if you're a lover of soul music and hip hop this is THE record for you.  I feel bad it's not getting the marketing push it deserves, but I have a feeling it will quickly generate incedible word of mouth.  John Legend and Kayne West created an album that uses a classical soul sound with a hip hop feel to tell everyday tales with contemporary dialect. <br /> <br />Cop this disc.
B00005JMAH|5.0|For the most part, the casting is spot on with what I've seen in my head when I've read Rowlings' novels.  I miss Richard Harris, but his replacement is able and I believe will eventually take the role as his own.   <br /> <br />I particulary enjoy seeing Alan Rickman as Snape.  He's exactly the actor I would have placed in that role.  <br /> <br />The special effects are entertaining and emphasize the points of the story without becoming too distracting.  That's sometimes hard to do in a sci fi or fantasy film.  Particularly amusing as the Rasta-man shrunken head who is the co-pilot for the night bus.  Bugbeak is beautifully realized with enough fantasy and animal characteristics to make him stand out in my memory as an outstanding creation.   <br /> <br />I also think the team of kid actors are growing nicely into the part.  What I like about Harry, Ron, and Hermione is how well they work as a team.  They learn from each other and grow as friends, which I think is one of the best points of the story.
B000002KLG|5.0|What to say? I own some of George Benson's albums 'cuz I'm still a big fan he's one of my next endeavors of jazz I grew up since Chuck Mangione, Miles Davis, Donald Byrd, Grover Washington, Jr., Duke Ellington whom I listen 2 the most around my childhood. I always admire him for his sense of singing, scating and guitar playing. People dubbed him the Wes Montgomery of 2day in jazz history. <br /> <br />I love every song that he did on this album incl. the touchy song \\"Moody's Mood for Love\\" whom he duet w/ Patti Austin which is kinda of sultry paying tribute 2 the saxman James Moody. <br /> <br />It has 8 vocal songs and 2 instrumentals and still is bangin. I don't care if u're ain't a fan to jazz or else don't listen to secular music.  <br /> <br />If this is not 4 you, you shouldn't buy it. <br /> <br />I recommended for any music lover or jazz lover to appreciate the kind of history that GB was in during his career.
6305622914|5.0|Just about the time you think no one is capable of making a fresh and original comedy anymore, along comes something like The Full Monty, to surprise and delight you with wit and subtlety and insight.    The story of unemployed steel workers in Sheffield, England who decide to put on a male striptease show for one night to make some money is a simple premise that is beautifully realized because of the time the film takes to build our understanding of these men and their different plights and motivations.  We come to know and care for them as they come to care for each other. The comedy grows from the characters and their personalities and their different reactions and situations.  There is sympathy and sensitivity to their desperation: Gaz (Robert Carlyle), the ex-con hustler, desperate to keep a connection with his son; Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), the manager, desperate to hold onto his middle-class lifestyle; Dave (Mark Addy), chubby and insecure, desperate to hold onto his wife; and so on.  Expertly played by these actors, new to American audiences in 1997, but now familiar, the laughter evoked is wry and humane and, in the end, joyful.    The film carefully builds the story with expert comedic setups (the auditions and rehearsals, etc.) of everyday men trying to do something they are seemingly unequipped and ill-prepared to accomplish, with touches of pathos as we see the troubles and strains in their personal lives.  All this leads to the Big Night and a grand finale that is funny, heart-warming and beautifully filmed.  A terrific little film with a lot on its mind, beneath the humor.  Something to do with the dignity of work, of self-respect, and of the touching care one can find amidst people undergoing hard times.  A gem.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|From the start of the film, it is obvious that Napoleon Dynamite is a comedy that is not for all tastes.  Those who enjoy the predictable, low brow, gross out comedies like Old School or recent hits like Dodgeball will most likely get little enjoyment out of the film, but fans of films of Wes Anderson may find something to admire here.  Taking place in Preston, Idaho, high school student Napoleon (Jon Heder) spends his days either being ignored or ridiculed by his fellow classmates.  His family life isn't much better, with his free loading uncle in the mix and his older brother finding his soul mate via the internet.  Napoleon experiences other adventures, such as an ill-fated trip to the school dance, and helping his friend Pedro run for school president.  Oh yeah, Napoleon dances too.  The comedy is subtle to say the least, so don't go in expecting any laugh out loud scenarios.  Napoleon Dynamite isn't a bad film at all, but it's not something that everyone will enjoy, and some will even be annoyed at some of the film's pacing and style, but that aside it's still worth watching.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I'm not going to join the war over whether this is a great film or not -- it evidently appeals to a certain audience, of which I am one.  <br />That audience might be \\"film geeks\\" because I'm a little perturbed at the DVD packaging claim of \\"widescreen anamorphic.\\" It's not in anamorphic widescreen. <br />One side of the DVD contains a 1.33:1 cropped full screen version. The other side contains a LETTERBOXED version, not, as the package says, an anamorphic 1.85:1 version. Thus, on a widescreen television, you're presented with the choice of a stretched but cropped image, or a letterboxed, stretched, less-resolution image. <br />Just a warning.
B00069L0XG|5.0|first, an action horror movie is a great concept. to put resident evil as one, and even better concept. now some people didn't like the first because it didn't have much to do with the first game. that was the point of paul anderson, he was trying to breate a prelude to the story, there is nothing wrong with that except when he was making the film he didn't know that resident evil 0 was being made. oh well, what can you do. the movie is still a good movie.  <br />the motive was to figure out what happened and now that they were stuck, they had to get out. the wasn't slow anywhere, it was a good fast paste movie for not having a lot of action in it.  <br />now the second movie, a tab bit less story, but still had a story to keep it motivated and not to be dull (slow moving or to drag the story out) at any parts. some parts seem redone in other movies, like the graveyard scene with the dead coming out of the graves. well is resident evil 3 the game this happenes, and what is the movie based on? can anyone help me here... THE GAME! that's right! so not only is it a great action sequence, but also taking from the game as well for the fans. this is how you make good action movies and people will not relize that this is one. has there been a good action movie lately without a bunch of CG effects in it that makes it look cartoonish? this movie uses alittle, but it mostly stunts, and that is how most of them should be. <br />people don't like this movie because they usually don't like action movies about defeating the bad guy. these movies serve there purpose, i like action movies, but you should see my collection, i own 13 going on 30, why, because i likes the plot and the story was good and held up well, i also own the wedding singer and other comedies. good will hunting all the way to the terminator for God sakes! the point of the is i don't select movies by action or whatever, i judge on how they are put together.  <br />resident evil 1 and 2 are put together good, andgive you a rush of action and quick story telling enough to make a good movie, but someparts you might now want to be eating spagetti for dinner, try some tums or gingerale.     <br />if you get upset at some people for saying it is a bad movie just remember they probably never watched it. and also rememnber, resident evil made 200 million dollars and the second film made just about that. these movies are here to stay for at least a third and they already set the date for it for 2006, so start getting excited! resident evil: afterlife is the name for it now, but it could change at anytime. resedent evil apocolypse had 3 names before it was finished. <br />ok, i hoped this helped and made more knowledge for you. by the way i played all the games too and beat them all. if people say bad things, whatever they just hate themselves and there lives and have nothing to live for or benefit other people. have fun with life, but don't do stupid things. buying used movies from amazon.com makes me feel better. if you don't like the movie then you don't, but it doesn't mean it's stupid. over 400 million dollars gross for 2 movies says something, hey people like them, you don't? don't watch 'em and shut up.

B000062YAZ|5.0|few guitarists can match the spitfire chops that kerry king and jeff hanneman serve up here. the greatest axeman duo IMO. this cds full of classic speed metal songs. ANGEL OF DEATH is one of my fav songs ever, along with RAINING BLOOD. those are the standout tracks, but some other good ones are ALTAR OF SACRIFICE, JESUS SAVES, NECROPHOBIC, and some others i cant think of right now. only song i always skip is PIECE BY PIECE, becasue of the super cheesy lyrics. pick this up if u like speed metal, but be warned, Slayers vocals arent as soft as metallica or megadeth, so if u only like real singing i wouldnt get this yet.
B000002UR7|3.0|This was Radiohead in 1993. Before the Bends, Before OK Computer, before they attracted millions of impassioned fans all over the world. It represents their breakthrough to music recognition. 'Creep' is the signature song on this album and, for me, the best. It sums up much of what Radiohead is about - a sensitive, introverted outsider, sick at the superficiality of the world. It's style is fairly mainstream, stadium rock almost. Radiohead are known for their experimental sounds but they still do the basic stuff superbly. Other great songs on the album are 'Anyone Can Play Guitar' featuring interesting vocal distortions by Thom Yorke, a trait he developed in later albums, 'Stop Whispering' and 'Blow Out', which culminates in a tumultuous crescendo of guitar sound.<br /><br />Apart from that, there is much that is not great in this album. Many of the songs on the second half are pretty mediocre and forgettable for me, not displaying any of the original musical traits of themes that Radiohead are known for.<br /><br />I don't think this is an exceptional album that is only underrated because of the later success of 'The Bends' or 'OK Computer'. It is held back by too many uninspiring songs. But it is the album that held the key to much of Radiohead's later success, and it is interesting because of that.
B0006A9FMI|4.0|Despite the fact that this dvd really doesn't include english subs just captions, i just want to add that when i received my package, the security bandage was stick to the silver side of the dvd which as you all know is the side the dvd player reads so i have to remove it carefully, i could do it without damaging the dvd but the manufacturers or dreamworks should take note of this.
B0002X314C|5.0|I have to say I probably purchase CDs about once a year.  I love music, but it's only once in awhile that I can honestly listen to the same artist for 15 tracks in a row and not get bored, but John Legend's \\"Get Lifted\\" is such a truly amazing collection of music, lyrics, and instrumentation that I haven't taken out of my cd player in the past week.  I was almost upset that I paid such a LITTLE amount for such a worthwhile investment.  He is comparable to modern artists like Musiq Soulchild and D'Angelo in the sense that he encorporates the rhythm and soul of old-school and gospel music and instrumentation into the lyrics of modern r&b.  Truly superb effort. <br />Key tracks: <br />#6- Number One <br />#8- Ordinary People*** <br />#9- Stay With You*** <br />#12- Refuge
B000053V7Q|5.0|When watching the rehearsal portion of this DVD, check out James Burton's music stand!  You'll see an original sheet music copy of American Trilogy by Micky Newberry.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|In my humble oppinion I think this movie is fantastic.  It draws you into this fantastic dreamy world filled with rained soaked heavy clouded sky and shimmering distant city lights.  I felt like I was trapped in this enormously beautiful hotel in the middle of nowhere, far away from home.  Having been left in many a hotel across the country by my father on business trips, I identified with Scarlett Johanssen's character.  \\"Lost in Translation\\" translates to \\"Lost Souls\\", in my analogy of the film.  Both of the characters seemed to be jaded to some degree and both suffered from manic depression that seemed to be untreated. \\"Lost in Translation\\" has the charm and mysterious intrigue of the Japanese culture (which I happen to be fascinated by), and has a soothing pace and temperment that subtlely mesmorizes.  This film has become one of my all time faves. Brilliant directing as well, Sofia Coppola shocked the hell out of me with this.
B000002J03|4.0|With this album Led Zeppelin found their sound. A Whole Lotta Love is the standout song, THAT RIFF IS SOMETHING ELSE. But my personal fave is Heartbreaker. The Lemon song would be banned today. Quite sexually explicit.\\"You got that Juice running down my leg\\". Moby Dick is a Bonham showcase, where Bonzo hits everything but the kitchen sink. And my second favourite song on the album is the beautiful \\"Thankyou\\".I rate this album as Zeppelins 3rd best ever. With \\"Physical Graffiti\\" and \\"Zoso\\" coming in at 1st and 2nd place. Still no true Zep fan can be without this album. Buy it.

THESE CAPTIONS ARE DESIGNED FOR THE HARD OF HEARING AND IT IS GREAT THAT STUDIOS INCLUDE THEM.  HOWEVER,MOST STUDIOS ALSO INCLUDE A SEPERATE SUBTITLE TRACK, IF THERE IS NO DUBBING.

B000002UAO|3.0|For those of us that were there at the time the album came out, the song \\"I've Just Seen A Face\\" is sorely missed. It was on the original US release and for some unaccountable reason the much earlier \\"Drive My Car\\" is substituted. Why can't they just release these things like they were originally. I want \\"Beatles VI\\" for instance! Is this all Michael Jackson's fault?

6305308659|5.0|Perfectly cast, with an unusual theme that no one has really come up with before and put to the big screen.  I sat enthralled the entire time.   <br /> <br />I think this was both Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon's first big acting breaks, we know they both went on to huge things but talk about breakthrough, watershed moments for both of them.  Witherspoon is slutty Jen in moder times, and sweet, pure, virginal Mary Sue/Muffin when she and her brother are transported through means of a magical tv remote (given to them by tv repairman, Don Knotts.)  She takes care of the sweet, pure and virginal side of Mary Sue in short order.  I was just waiting for someone in the film, probably her brother David (Maguire) to bring up how her actions could affect the time/space continuem thing... <br /> <br />Then there's David, (\\"Bud\\" in Pleasantville).  God, Maguire's good at playing geeks and nerds and doing it while being completely endearing and likeable and charming.  He's the quiet, unpopular half of the Jen-David twinset.  His favorite show is the tv sitcom from the fifties, Pleasantville, with which he can recite all the lines right along with the characters.  <br /> <br />This movie isn't just a fluffy little bit of fifties-visitation. People have to remember that this isn't Happy Days.  There are no greasers in Pleasantville. It's a tv show, and it's depicted just the way Leave It To Beaver or Father Knows Best used to do it, where the women stayed  home to do the housework and cooking (in crinolines and pearls, of course), and met the \\"breadwinners\\" at the door with a martini and a dazzling smile. <br /> <br />It's amusing, but there's something so beguiling about watching two teenagers bring the apple to paradise. (That's a direct reference in this movie, by the way.)  Jen and especially David's confusion and wonder at being in this place that shouldn't exist, watching their newly introduced ideas colorize the inhabitants of this place that shouldn't exist, subtly making statements about closeminded people and the results of non-pluralism and the great lengths and lies and blockage some, particularly leaders, will go to maintain their own illusions, is both a poignant and potent statement of the state of things in the modern world. <br /> <br />I can't emphasize enough what a stellar cast is in this film--Loved William H. Macy in this, and recognized several alumni from the tv show Buffy the Vampire Slayer too!  Everyone in it is just outstanding.  In fact the whole movie is just outstanding. This is one that I will be able to watch and enjoy more than just once.  <br /> <br />The movie has a little bit of everything, it's funny, sad in places, at one point it's very frightening as we witness the reaction of a mob to such a radical idea of a nude work of art on a store window (In color, yet!)  I rooted for the characters the whole time.  We even sympathize with George (Macy) as his whole perfect, insular world crumbles around him, his marriage unravels, and he's reduced to eating cocktail olives because he doesn't know how to fix anything for himself to eat. (Betty always took care of that, but she's \\"gone out\\".  For 3 days.) <br /> <br />It's a quirky little film. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I decided to spoil myself and by this for my x-mas, and I haven't been disappointed. This is a spectacular review of World War 2.  <br /> <br />For me, the best thing about it is that it produced in the 70's, so the vast majority of the interview's are first hand accounts. Whether it's people who were close to the main protagonists, general's in the field, or civilians who were affected directly by the combat. <br /> <br />Secondly, it does not take a judgmental stance. I haven't watched the episode's that deal with the discovery of the concentration camps, but I'm assuming that they will maintain their editorial integrity at that stage as well. The fact that they are relating the facts to the viewer, without colouring the accounts about who was being a \\"goodie\\" or a \\"baddie\\". Accounts from German (particularly) soldiers are given as much credence as those from the allied powers. <br /> <br />This is truly a masterpiece of documentary film making, which has been beautifully compiled onto DVD. Laurence Olivier's narration is perfect for the piece, and the sheer scale of the footage used is breathtaking. <br /> <br />Would make a spectacular (if rather pricy!) present for anyone interested in the genre. If you have an interest in the Second World War, don't shirk because of the price, you'll love every single minute of this DVD, and treated right, you'll have it for another 30 years.
B0006JC4UO|1.0|This is a fun movie.  John Wayne, Maureen Ohara, Stephanie Powers,  the Duke's son Patrick, plus all the other actors, must have had a ball making this film.  It shows.  Unfortunately, the DVD is so bad, you can not enjoy it.  I don't know when the John Wayne estate will release an authorized DVD, but I MOST HIGHLY RECOMMEND you wait for it.
B0002X314C|5.0|This CD is absolutely amazing. I wasn't really familar with John Legend until a friend suggested I buy the CD since I'm a huge R&B fan. If you like artists like Musiq Soulchild or Anthony Hamilton, where the lyrics are meaningful and the songs have a message..then go get this album. His lyrics are beautiful and truthful. I highly recommend this album!

B000002OZY|5.0|What I love about Tommy is that it is one of those rare albums that is at the same time revolutionary (and, yes, artistic) and superficially enjoyable. Like most early concept albums and rock operas, this particular Amazing Journy is highly song-driven, memorable for its spectacular individual tracks. This is different than, say, Dark Side of the Moon, which derives its power from the combined effect of its nine songs, hich on their own would be interesting at best.  <br />This is not to say that Tommy is no more than the sum of its parts. Quite the contrary, the opera's conceptual sweep, interlocking musical themes, and story create a spectacular atmosphere which all but nullifies the existence of the album's weaker moments (and trust me, there are very few of those). <br />So, in that sense, Tommy is a nearly ideal concept album: A collection of mostly spectacular individual songs that combine to form something even better. <br />The story of the opera is actually one of its weaker aspects, in that it doesn't hang together very well in some places, while some scenes seem completely superflous (my guess is that they were placed there as an excuse to include a really good song to illustrate that scene. For example, you could have removed \\"Pinball Wizard\\" and and a few lines from \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\" and the story would have made just as much sense). To me, the true conceptual triumph of Tommy is the atmosphere the music creates, that feeling of intensity, gloom, and hope, that epic quality that's kicked off from the first dramatic note of the \\"Overture\\" and is sustained to the closing notes of  \\"We're Not Gonna Take It.\\" <br /> <br />The story of Tommy does, however, bear repeating. I think this can best be done on a song-by-song basis: <br /> <br />1.Overture- This is a mostly instrumental piece of music which contains a lot of the themes that can be found later in the album. A bit of lyric at the end informs us that \\"Captain Walker didn't come home, his unborn child will never know him. Believe him missing with a number of men, don't expect to see him again.\\" <br /> <br />2.It's A Boy- Young Tommy Walker (son of the afformentioned Captain) is born. <br /> <br />3.1921- The title refers to the year in which our story takes place. Tommy's mother takes a lover in the absence of her husband. It is this lover who sings the oppening verse. but then, surprise surprise, Captain Walker returns home, discovers what has been going on, and kills the lover. Tommy witnesses this event, which causes the father to panic. He tells the boy that he didn't \\"hear it, didn't see it,\\" and tells him not to say a word about was happening. The effect of this on Tommy's psyche is devestating: So shocked is he by what has happened that he forms a seemingly permanent mental barrier between himself and the world, behind which no-one can reach him. He is effectively deaf, blind, and dumb. It is interesting to note that the father sings the last verse of this song, which is identical to the first, which was sung by the lover. <br /> <br />4.Amazing Journy- Tommy, isolated from the world outside, developes his imagination to abnormal levels. The title refers to the \\"amazing journy\\" that the boy takes within himself. <br /> <br />5.Sparks- A spectacular instrumental piece which reflects Tommy's inner journy. <br /> <br />6.The Hawker- A cover of a Mose Alisson song about a prostitute, it takes on a new meaning in the context of this album. Tommy's parents take the boy to some sort of faith healer or witch docter to try to help him. This is, of course, a failure. <br /> <br />7.Christmas- Tensions are heightened in the Holiday season. Family and friends come to visit the Walkersand celebrate Christmas. The celebration is darkened by Tommy, who sits silently by himself and doesn't notice anyone. Religious family members worry that he will never be able to worship, and they fear for his soul. There is a happy side to the song, however. As a present, Tommyrecieves a miniature pinball machine, which he somehow manages to play. More on that later... <br /> <br />8.Cousin Kevin- the first of two darkly funny songs by bassist John Entwissle, tells of how Tommy is sadistically tortured by his nasty cousin. <br /> <br />9. The Acid Queen- Another song in which the Walkers take their son to a miracle healer without success. <br /> <br />10.Underture- Another incredibly good instrumental, \\"Underture\\" seems to have no real purpose in the story, except perhaps to serve as an \\"intermission.\\" Note that on the original album, which was a double LP, \\"Underture\\" was the first track on the second record. <br /> <br />11.Do You Think Its Alright- The Walkers debate weather or not they should let tommy's uncle Ernie babysit the boy while they go out.  <br /> <br />12.Fiddle About- They decide to leave Tommy with Uncle Ernie after all, but guess what? The old man has an innapropriate little hobby. This is the second of the two disturbingly funny Entwissle numbers. <br /> <br />13.Pinball Wizard- Tommy turns out to be incredibly good at pinball, and uses his condition to his advantage in order to win a championship. <br /> <br />14.There's A Doctor- And he just might be able to cure the boy! <br /> <br />15.Go To The Mirror!- The Doctor doesn't cure Tommy, but he does make a shocking discovery: Tommy's problem isn't physical, it's psychological. <br /> <br />16.Tommy Can You Hear Me- The Walkers are filled with hope at this new turn of events, and struggle to \\"revive\\" Tommy into the real world. <br /> <br />17.Smash The Mirror- Some progress is made in this area. The boy seems to be fascinated by mirrors, which suggests that he can see himself. However, it seems he can't do much more. In a fit of frustrated rage, Tommy's mother smashes the mirror. This act of blind emotion pulls Tommy right out of his stupor. <br /> <br />18.Sensation- Word of what happened spreads, and Tommy becomes a celebrity. The boy is able to speak English and function normally in society, perhaps due to the fact that he really did learn about the outside world during his stupor, and kept it all in his subconcious. Or maybe Pete just got lazy. <br /> <br />19. Miracle Cure- This one really should have come before \\"Sensation.\\" It just illustrates that the papers have gotten wind of what's happened. <br /> <br />20.Sally Simpson- Tommy begins giving lectures (possibly of a religious nature), drawing from his experiences with the mental block. Sally is a particularly enamoured follower of his. She decides she has to talk to him, goes to great lengths to do so, and ultimatly gets injured. <br /> <br />21.I'm Free- Tommy begins to believe that he is some sort of Messiah, and urges people to follow him. <br /> <br />22.Welcome- Tommy expands his house into a sort of religious center and invites the town to live with him. <br /> <br />23.Tommy's Holiday Camp- At the advice of Uncle Ernie, Tommy builds a religious camp for his followers. <br /> <br />24.we're Not Gonna Take It- This story does not have a happy ending. Tommy becomes increasingly egomaniacal, and his religion becomes all the more demanding on its followers. In the end they rebel against Tommy and he's left all alone. <br /> <br />And so, there you have it. <br /> <br />Tommy is a spectacular and influencial work, an entertaining, thought-provoking and downright essential record.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is a concept album, the thought of which usually sends shivers down my spine as invariably they are awful. OK Computer, however, takes its central theme of a modern computerised world which dehumanises man, stripping him of emotion and feeling, and skillfully threads it throughout the album. Every song touches on this Orwellian idea in a unique and insiteful manner, both from a lyrical and musical point of view. From the 'town where you can't smell a thing' in Subterranean Homesick Alien, to 'a job that slowly kills you' in No Surprises, Radiohead paint a gloomy, terrifying picture of a dystopia that is almost a reality. Just as in Orwell's 1984, OK Computer leaves you both frightened and angry, no better highlighted than in the standout track of the album, Paranoid Android. This is an incredible song, bringing together a myriad of rhythms and emotions in a single, epic anthem. It is an emotional rollercoaster, taking you from despair to anger and back again, amidst haunting vocals and powerful guitars - one of the greatest songs of all time.     Many people consider OK Computer to be depressing; while it can be bleak and despairing, it is angry and defiant at the same time. In Fitter Happier a computer recites instructions on how man must live life. Radiohead's mutinous response is to deliver an album that resists categorising, is intentionally uneasy and non-listener-firendly, has no standard verse/chorus/verse formula, and is remarkable for its originality of form. This lack of traditional structure means the album never loses its impact or grows tired. It's one of only a handful of albums I honestly never get sick of listening to. No CD collection should be without this album, it truly is that good.
B000002U9W|5.0|this is the most underrated pink floyd album, maybe the most underated rock album! everyone calls it \\"transitional\\" \\"experimental\\" blah blah, it's pure genious!! i'll admit it is quite often bizarre, but nothing close to let's say, Frank Zappa, or even The Wall for that matter. \\"Summer '68\\" and \\"fat old sun\\" are two of my favorite pink floyd songs, and In my opinion this is by far better than (oh go ahead and crucify me) The Wall. If you like mellow, rainy day type of music (kinda like the stuff that's on Meddle)you're sure to love this
B000067CPX|3.0|Despite the fact that I've known about the RHCPs for many years (as a matter of fact, I used to play in a local rock band that covered Under the Bridge sveral times), I never got into their music until quite recently. That was when I spent a month in Paris visiting various used CD stores.  <br />I stumbled across Californication and thought it was simply GREAT!!! I also bought their Live at Hyde Park double CD and several others as well. <br />Contrary to what most people think, I find their One Hot Minute CD HOT!!!!!! It totally kicks a--!!!!!! I'm also glad that Dave Navarro will be playing with the newly reformed Motley Crue, one of my all-time favorite 80's metal bands, during their Reunion Tour. <br />Getting back to the RHCP thang, I also managed to buy the By the Way CD. Although I must confess that it does have its moments, I must declare that it's the WEAKEST of their CDs.  <br />Producer Rick Rubin must have kicked their a---- around a little to get them OUT of their present pop ballad state!!! Even though it's been amazingly produced by the Super Rock Guru, By the Way is pretty bland and somewhat of a clunker... <br />I hope that the RHCPs get their act together and release a new album this year that won't alienate their new fans like myself who prefer their old sound over their somewhat syrupy and \\"mature\\" radio-friendly pop ballads!!!  <br />I just hope that that happens and the RHCPs manage to deliver an album somewhere between Californication, BSSM and Mother's Milk this year. <br />Bon courage and Godspeed to the RHCPs in their new artistic and musical (hopefully funkier and heavier!!!!) endeavours in 2005!!!!
B000002KET|5.0|Now, this doesn't compare to the masterpiece of Paranoid, but all in all its still a great album... Sabbath Bloody Sabbath is phenomonal, National Acrobat and Sabbra Cadabra kick ass (these were combined by Metallica, my favorite band, into a song off their Garage, inc. album...) Fluff is crazily good, Killing yourself to live is awesome, and the list goes on... I definately reccomend anyone who likes this cd gets Garage, Inc... its phenomenal and the cover of Sabbra Cadabra is great...
B000001F76|4.0|Well #129 aint so bad fer an ol hick from out west. I always listen to this CD set when Im grooming my horses or plucking the chickens. Ol bess jus luves it for that special night out by the barn when the mood is right...Just kidding.   This is an essential album to have if you like country music. I like the simplicity and frankness Hank uses in his lyrics. I cant imagine a better greatest hits compilation for Hank than this one. A worthwhile purchase.
B0002Y4T92|2.0|Brian May on the cutting room floor?  Deduct three stars for that.
068484267X|2.0|Even though it wasn't a page-turner, I enjoyed this book at least half way through because it was written so candidly.  However, by the end of the book, I found more reasons to dislike it than I did to like it. <br />#1. Yes, as many others have said, it was supremely depressing.  I can tolerate a lot of depressing literature as long as there are small victories, or occasional heartwarming lessons, or true humor toward the situation, but I found none of that with this book.  I'm not sure what had others \\"roaring with laughter.\\"  The most I could find were tiny oddities and ironies that could render no more than a smirk. <br />#2. Can you really win a Pulizer with that many references to masturbation?  I really could have done wihout that. <br />#3. This was the most disappointing of all.  I realize that it was an autobiography, and, therefore, isn't supposed to have a regular plot, but it did need some form of resolution.  After reading a novel, one shouldn't have to read the sequel to find out the ending.  Perhaps a good editor could have helped Mr. McCourt cut away some of the the masturbation so that he had room to finish the story. <br />
B00005JNLY|3.0|John Clasky (Adam Sandler) has a problem, well actually he has two: one is his freaked out wife, Deborah (Tea Leoni) who is in desperate need of Prozac to control her mood swings, and her general bumping off the walls in a kind of early mid-life crisis, I lost-my-job, woe-is-me, I'm just a soccer Mom now, what-am-I gonna do panic.<br /><br />John's other problem is that he very well may be in love with the new Nanny, Flor (Paz Vega) who is every thing that Deborah is not: warm, loving and caring.<br /><br />John Brooks (TV's \\"Mary Tyler Moore Show,\\" \\"As Good As it Gets\\") in a rare for him, miss-fire has made a film that is just not very funny: the writing is average and most of the performances are barely present. That is except for Leoni as Deborah whose performance is so whacked out and out of control; we can only blame Brooks for the miscalculation. In previous films (\\"Flirting With Disaster,\\" \\"Hollywood Ending\\") Leoni has been witty, smart even Katherine Hepburn-ish. But here the material she has to work with and Brooks direction have her saying and doing things to her family that are just plain thoughtless on the plus side and ugly on the negative. Brooks: this is not \\"Ordinary People,\\" this is a Comedy!!!<br /><br />On the positive side, Paz Vega as Flor fills the screen with warmth and sensuality and a hell of a lot of horse sense: something truly lacking in the Clasky household. She is a real find and she brings a needed stability to the proceedings. Sandler plays his regular guy, put-upon schlump here and as usual he does a good job.<br /><br />\\"Spanglish\\" is a minor blip in the career that is James Brook's but the one thing of which it will always be remembered is the introduction of the luminous and incandescent Paz Vega to the American screen.
B00005JNLY|3.0|Spanglish is a film that attempts to display the diversity of two different cultures.  Culture clash is often overlooked when one is travelling abroad, one prefers to assume that their own culture idealism/values/beliefs/habits are one in the same throughout the world.   <br /> <br />A movie showing the differences is always a neat idea, and is often educational as well.  Spanglish attempts to show this, but the true, the underlyining story in this movie is an unhappy American woman who needs to learn a lesson on being content with what she's got and not to reach out for unrealistic fantasies.  Sandler plays her unhappy husband and starts to stray. The premise of the Mexican mother and daughter coming to LA for a better life and finding the culture clash challenging is not the true story in this film. <br /> <br />That is not to say that I didn't enjoy this film, just that I thought would be focused more than what is depicted in the trailors.  Sandler is great, I really enjoy his more serious roles.  All the acting is superb, which may be the only thing that saves this movie. It is not the story of culture clash, it's a story of troubled people in a troubled marriage.  It would of been nice if the American couple learned lessons from the Mexican import, but that didn't happen.  There is really no reason or purpose for the cultural reference in this movie. <br /> <br />It is nontheless entertaining enough, a bit slow, a bit humerous, worthy of seeing once.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|\\"Mary Poppins\\" is back and I am glad that she is: all spiffed up, digitally remastered, looking young and fresh once again.<br /><br />It has been many years since I've seen Mary (Julie Andrews) and Bert (Dick Van Dyke) and if anything the film is more fun, the songs more tuney and beautifully performed than ever.<br /><br />In many ways \\"Mary Poppins\\" is aimed at adults, rather than children: the Suffragette story line of Mrs. Banks (Glynis Johns) and the honor-your-children-as-human-beings story line of Mr. Banks (David Tomlinson).<br /><br />In other words, \\"MP\\" is more profound, deeper, thoughtful and sadder for adults than it would be for children. It works on at least two levels and that's more than you can say for some of the tripe being released recently.<br /><br />At the finale when Mary's duty is completed and it is time for her to move on to another family, I shed a tear for good old Mary and particularly for Julie Andrew's performance as Mary: you can have your current pop icons, I'll take Mary Poppins... no spoonful of sugar needed.
B000003S09|5.0|Even if you are not into `progressive rock', this is still an important album in the development of rock and roll and a must for any serious collector of rock music.  <br />In the Court of Crimson King is one of the landmark albums in the development of progressive rock. The music alternates between soothing and smooth(I Talk To The wind),doomy and gloomy(Epitaph),anarchic and chaotic,yet controlled and precise jazzy playing (2ist century Schizoid man),experimental(moonchild), and epic(The title track). <br />Mellotron is used heavily to the fore here and it`s probaly one of the reasons this album has held up better than progressive rock bands utilizing the hammond organ,which sounds dated and quaint. <br />All of the playing is superb; Robert Fripp glides on guitar,Michael Giles is sensational on drums alternating between delicate and just flat powerhouse playing. Ian Mcdonald`s contributions on woodwinds and mellotron are nothing short of sensational and it is he who wrote the bulk of this album. And Greg Lake is highly underrated as a bass player. Check out the bass runs on schizoid man. But he had one of the more magnificient voices in rock;his vocals add just more class to the proceedings. <br />35 plus years later,it`s still a classic.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|\\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is so low-key and understated as to be non-existent. If this is the state of actual teenagers today, this country is in big trouble.<br /><br />MTV Movies has assembled this film to go after the cult movie business: that is the business that keeps-on-a coming! As in \\"Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" and \\"Showgirls\\": films so bad that they are good.<br /><br />The problem here is that both the makers of the \\"RHS\\" and \\"Showgirls\\" tried to do something important and wound up on their a**; whereas MTV bypassed the important thing and went directly for the a** heap which is calculating at least and pandering at best.<br /><br />But, as I've always said: it's what is up there on the screen that counts and what there is up there in \\"ND\\" is dull, dumb and disastrous...the three deadly d's.<br /><br />With absolutely no redeeming qualities, either artistic or otherwise, \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" will probably make hundreds of millions while a film like \\"Sideways\\" will wither and die. But that is life here in the USA, 2005. And don't argue with success, right?
B0006399FS|4.0|If you are looking for experimental U2 such as `Zooropa' and `Pop',then this album is not for you. <br />But if you are looking for clear, concise,good qualty songwritng in which there is a dearth of nowadays,then this album is for you. <br />It`s not my favorite U2 album(I`m more keen on their early period,particularly `War'),but I still enjoy it enough to listen to it repeatedly. <br />Highlights for me are `Vertigo',probaly one of the more hard rocking U2 songs in a while. `Sometimes you cant make it on your own',City of Blinding Lights, and `Man and a  Woman' still prove U2 can make stirring,heartfelt, emotional music. How many bands can you say of that nowadays ?
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Troy became one of my all time favorite movies as soon as I walked out of the theatre. I enjoyed this movie more than any other historical epic(Braveheart,Spartacus,Gladiator, etc) It was just amazing to watch. The fight between achilles and hector in particular was really cool. The major complaint you will read about this movie is that it is historically inacurate which is somewhat true but if you want a really entertaining movie you have to change the story up a little to be entertaining or you just end up with a movie like Alexander. I am a brad pitt fan and I couldn't be happier with his performance in this movie, The movie was just thrilling from start to finish.
B0000033P0|2.0|There is no doubt that ELp are masterful musicians. But this album is one of their weaker efforts. <br />The Tarkus suite has some fierce, tight as a drum playing,but the production is quite crude(sounding as if it was recored in a cardboard box) and such techniques such as Lake`s voice processed with echo are woefully dated. <br />Worst of all are some of Lake`s lyrics for the Tarkus suite in which they are muddled and confusing. How can you talk to the winds of time?How can you know how the waters rhyme/taste that wine..Whatttttt!!!????? <br />`Battlefield' is the one track where it sounds as if Lake wasnt indulging in weed. Here his lyrics are concise, detailing the futility of war. <br />If it wasnt for the one track, I doubt very many people would get the concept. Thankfully, the artist, William Neal has portrayed tarkus kicking the ass of several other man/mechanical mutations , finding his match in Manticore,getting wounded, and then skipping town,floating down the river. <br />This suite had much more energy live(listen to the triple live set,Welcome Back my friends..)and ELp were alwys better in a live setting than they were in the studio. <br />The second side is made up of shorter tracks that are mostly forgettable. Questionable and silly, insipid lyrics abound once again. `Jeremy Bender' is supposed to be about a cross gending fender bender,so not so bad there. But A time and a place and particularly `Infinite space' are hilarious. In `Infinite space', Lake lets loose with lines such as; <br />`Can you believe/ God makes you breathe <br />Why did he lose/six million Jews? <br />!!!!!!???????? <br />Or this classic bit of rhyming; <br />Now don`t be afraid/Man is man made <br />And when the hour comes/don`t turn away <br />Face the light of day? And do it your way?It`s the only way <br />`Bitches Crystal' is supposedly about witchcraft,but Lake resorts to shrill screaming that makes it hard to decipher what he is ranting about over with hysterics.  `Are You ready Eddie' is just filler,trying to prove that ELp can play simple rock and roll,but Emerson cannot stop his compulsion to solo, throwing in licks for showtunes.  <br />This album is recommended for people who   dont let  silly little things such as lyrics get in the way,or for those  who regularly sustain a diet of hallucinogenic drugs. Great playing is essential, Ill give you that,but what you say is just as important. <br />If you want quintessential ELp, try Brain Salad surgery. The lyrics and production are far superior.

B00002MZ4V|5.0|This was my first John Williams CD and I am not disappointed. Both CD's have a great mix of fast and slow songs. I just want to clear up what certain people said in some reviews. Nothing is wrong with the quality of the recordings. There are only four Star Wars songs on the CD's (3 on the first and 1 on the second). Each Star Wars song is different and comes from a different movie in the trilogy (except the main theme). Sure maybe they're re-recordings but who cares if they are slightly faster than the original. They sound the same, and still sound great. I have to say that this is a great CD for anyone who wants good music.
0312330529|5.0|WARNING: This book is choc-a-bloc full of purple prose, schoolboy metaphors and glib philosophizing. It also never convinces you that it's real as true as it's supposed to be (though admittedly it's not being sold as an autobiography). But what the hell. It's also the most compelling and thrilling book I've read in years. Clearly Roberts has thrown his heart and soul into his work and his commitment (the sort of commitment only available to a monk or a guy in a prison cell) shines in every page. It's a remarkably generous book. Look past the cosmetic flaws and you'll be enthralled. <br />

B000002KMY|5.0|Dio sounds mean and so does Iommi in this the follow up to Heaven and Hell.  This sound carries through the first side.  I would say this is the rawest and meanest sound Sabbath ever had.  \\"Voodoo\\", \\"Sign of the Southern Cross\\", and \\"Mob Rules\\" are among Sabbath's best work.  The whole album is good.  \\"Slipping Away\\" has a more bluesy riff. \\"Over and Over\\" is a great ballad and has a great solo.  Iommi who never liked to play the same way from album to album in the early days again has a unique style on this album.  If you are a Dio fan or a Black Sabbath fan or an Iommi fan, this album is a must.  \\"Turn Up the Night\\" is fast paced and jams.  \\"Voodoo\\" is what I am talking about when I say mean and evil.  \\"Call me a liar, you knew,\\" or \\"Call me the devil, its true\\" are lines right out of the song.  \\"Sign of the Southern Cross\\" is epic and has a heavy main riff. It opens with a classical feel and which leads into the heavy main riff.  Clearly a Dio flavor with the beast and rainbows being subjects of the song.  It appears to be a mythilogical song based in the end times.  This is of course one of Dio's favorite subjects in the 80s, also inspiring songs like \\"Holy Diver\\" and \\"the Last In Line.\\" \\"Gather all around the young ones, they will make us strong,\\" are lines near the end. \\"Sign of the Souther Cross,\\" clearly the best song on the album.  \\"Mob Rules\\" is another mean one.  Its fast paced and jams.  \\"Country Girl\\" is a great song, great riff. \\"She was up from another world, just to bust another soul.\\"  A good song but not a great one is the blues riffed \\"Slipping Away\\". \\"Falling Off the Edge of the World\\" is another good one and again I say the solo on \\"Over and Over\\" is one of the highlights of the album.>>>>>>>>>>>>>  For those of you who don't know the history of Dio's early work in the 50s and 60s, I have a So You'd Like to Know Guide. Please check it out.  It lists a complete discograpy of Dio's work in the 50s and 60s.  If you didn't know he did almost 40 songs in that period.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|I have read the iliad more times than the newspaper, and this is not the epic trojan war that i know, its a fun movie, but not accurate, except for people names and the setting  (that would be troy).  upon my saying that, get it, cause you might be intruiged enough to learn and read the real trojan war, and not wolfgang petersons trojan war
B000002B7O|5.0|Diary of a Madman in my opinion is the greatest masterwork of music in the 20th century.  Many love \\"Blizzard\\" better because it has the popular \\"Crazy Train,\\" but no other rock 'n' roll album has had more musical thought put into it than \\"Diary of a Madman.\\"  \\"Blizzard of Oz\\" was a great album but this album showed where Randy's style was going.  The orchestration on this ablum is phenominal.  The different layers of guitar work and Randy's knowledge of the entire Guitar (fretboard, knobs and switches) is shown on this album.  Ozzy's vocals like on Blizzard are the best of his solo career.  The lyrics are well thought out and poetic. And Besides this album jams more than anything else ever put on vinyl or CD.        Randy showed a control over his guitar and amplifier and all the features and possible notes, noises and feedbacks on this album that surpass even Hendrix.  And it all is very musically sound and classically inspired.  No other guitarists work has as much feeling and originality to it than Randy Rhoads.  Even a blues man I knew said \\"that boy's got soul.\\"  One review I read called this album dull in comparison to \\"Blizzard.\\"  That's a joke.  Randy is harder and more raw on this album.  While many guitarists have tried to be classical, most end up unoriginal, or boring or lacking a soul a spirit to their music.  Who wants to sound exactly like Bach.  There are many technically proficiant players out there.  Some may even be better players but Randy blows them all away because he doesn't just play good, he sounds great.       Highlights: the solo on \\"Over the Mountain\\" , all of the guitar work on \\"You Can't Kill Rock n Roll\\". On this track Randy shows a knowledge of all the different voices a guitar can have.  \\"Believer\\" is a great song.  Dissonant with an ostinato bass line openning it up, there is much to do with classical inspiration in this song.  \\"Tonight\\" -- a ballad with soul.  It has a strong bass line with many different layers including piano, guitar volume swells and the ending solo is perhaps Randy's best solo work-- an emotion stirring solo that uses a knowledge of the entire electric guitar and possible noises that can be produced.  SATO starts with a mystical classical feel and drives into a hard fast jammer.  The last song on the album \\"Diary of a Madman\\" in my opinion is the greatest composition of modern music.  Completely classically inspired it showed Randy's complete depth as a classical composer.  The openning arpegiated chords are disonant and complex in nature.  They are played with a rubato feel.  This leads into a fast extemely hard driving theme very complex in rhythm.  Alternating 9/8  and 3+3+2/8.  The 1st verse is in 7/4 time.  The main theme is actually developed.  A classical concept.  The time signature in this song actually changes dozens of times.  The bridge is in 4/4 time and builds to an explosion and the ending returns to the main theme this time done by a guitar and an exorcist like chorus.  \\"Enemies fill up the pages are they me. Monday til Sunday in stages, Set Me free.\\"      If you don't understand what I've said here.  Don't worry.  I love this album the most because it jams.
B00005A0V0|3.0|Caravan's third album (their second for Decca/Deram) had two distinct sides, the second comprising one 22 minute suite conceived by keyboardist Dave Sinclair, Nine Feet Underground, with linking passages devised by the rest of the band. It would be wholly unfair to suggest it should have been renamed Six Feet Underground and quietly buried, but it is a less effective suite than, say, For Richard or The Love In Your Eye, although it became a concert favourite and is a good example of their instrumental dexterity, veering towards the more \\"progressive\\" end of their repertoire. The following year Dave Sinclair decamped to Robert Wyatt's Matching Mole, having played on his End Of An Ear solo album, making this the last album with the original line-up.<br /><br />However, it is the four songs on side one that best stand the test of time. Pye Hastings' only song on the album, Love To Love You, was the first of the results of the album sessions to be granted a release as it came out on a single a month before the album was released. The other side of the single, Richard Sinclair's charming Golf Girl, was equally strong but at 5.02 must have been considered too long to be an A-side. Richard Sinclair also contributed the title song, complete with fabulous bubble blowing solo, and Winter Wine, which Pye Hastings generously describes as \\"probably the finest song Richard Sinclair has ever written\\" in the notes to the album. The liner notes also point out with some pride that the album has never gone out of catalogue since its release in 1971.<br /><br />This re-issue comes bundled with a selection bonus tracks, starting with the out-take I Don't Know It's Name (Alias The Word) and an early version of Aristocracy, which turned up on Waterloo Lily. Work-in-progress versions of Winter Wine and Golf Girl follow, and finally an alternative mix of the last two sections of Nine Feet Underground
B00005176F|4.0|I was desparate for this album for about half a year, until I bought it.  It was my pride and joy, until I bought Guns N Roses, Appetite for Destruction.  The Guns n Roses literally put it to shame at the time, and I would have given it probably a 2* at the time.    Recently, nevertheless, I have been listening to it more, and have been more involved within it, and have been enjoying listening to it a lot more.  It now gets a 4*.    I don't know how many of you heard this, but Graham Coxon, the band's influencial guitarist left Blur before the recording of their most recent album, Think Tank.  I bought this album under the impression that it would be another impressive album from Blur, without realising that Graham Coxon had left.  I was very diappointed on first listening, therefore.    One of the things that makes this compilation good is that I enjoy listening to the band as the original four piece line- up, with Graham Coxon's somewhat impressive guitar, although not as good as some other guiatrists, which is one of the reasons why this album gets only 4*.    17 out of the 18 tracks gain at least 3*, most getting 4 and 5*.    1.  BEETLEBUM- 5*  2.  SONG 2- 5*  3.  THERE'S NO OTHER WAY- 4*  4.  THE UNIVERSAL- 5*  5.  COFFEE AND TV- 4*  6.  PARKLIFE- 4*  7.  END OF A CENTURY- 3*  8.  NO DISTANCE LEFT TO RUN- 4*  9.  TENDER- 3*  10. GIRLS AND BOYS- 3*  11. CHARMLESS MAN- 5*  12. SHE'S SO HIGH- 5*  13. COUNTRY HOUSE- 4*  14. TO THE END- 4*  15. ON YOUR OWN- 5*  16. THIS IS A LOW- 5*  17. FOR TOMORROW- 4*  18. MUSIC IS MY RADAR- 2*    Thats it.    The best songs, in my view, are Beetlebum, Song 2, The Universal, Charmless Man, This is a Low and In the End.  These all gain 5*.  They all have impressive guitar work from Coxon, and I don't know why he ever left.    Music is my Radar is my least favourite.  This in my view, is quite poor, and Blur have produced far better songs, which do not feature on the BEst of.  This is another reason why it does not gain 5*.    I used to be mad about Blur, I guess I still am, in a way.    This album will get you into all sorts of music- it did for me.  These days I prefer heavy metal, but I would have not dicovered heavy metal had I not bought this album in the first place.    I would recommend this Best of Compilation to anyone who wants a basis to rock music, with one of the world's most famous and popular Brit- Pop bands.    Thankyou, and I really recommend you buy this album.    Thankyou.
B00005UT85|4.0|There was a burgeoning musical scene in Canterbury in the psychedelic era of the later sixties, much of which stemmed from a band called the Wilde Flowers. Groups to emerge from this original nucleus included Gong, Soft Machine, Kevin Ayers and the Whole World, Hatfield and the North and of course Caravan, now based in nearby Whitstable, who evolved out of the remaining members of Wilde Flowers during 1967 when they decided not to be a soul band anymore. They were signed to Verve Records in 1968 with a line-up comprising singer and principal writer Pye Hastings, the brothers Richard and David Sinclair and Richard Coughlan.<br /><br />Their first album, Caravan, was released in October 1968, with the first two tracks, A Place Of My Own and Ride, extracted as a single the following January. It was in some ways a groundbreaking album that captured the whimsical and exploratory moods of the times with a sound that built on the changing styles of the contemporary underground and took them further.<br /><br />Pye's brother Jimmy played on the dreamily evocative Love Song With Flute, never having heard the song and recording the flute solo on the first take. The following song, the stage favourite Cecil Rons (a disguised Cecil Rhodes?) is in contrast a rowdy powerful piece with a yelled chorus. Guitar and bass are swapped over on two songs so that Richard Sinclair can take over on lead vocal for his songs Grandma's Lawn and Policeman. The closing track was a complex nine-minute piece inspired in part by a melody written in Wilde Flowers days by then member Brian Hopper. Where But For Caravan Would I? was the precursor of the direction Caravan would take on future albums, alongside their other strengths.<br /><br />On this edition both mono and stereo mixes of the album are included, and as a bonus track, the single version of 1970's Hello Hello, recorded for Decca as Verve/MGM had folded by this time, rounds off the CD
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I desperately wanted to like this movie; The rave reviews, the awards, and Bill Murray were all so enticing.  I tried.  I truly did.  But it was so boring.  It lulled me into a stupor and I can't even recall how it ended. <br /> <br />If it were possible, I would give this zero stars.  I graduated from film school but I\\"m not snooty.  I enjoy almost anything; all I ask is that it hold my interest.  This most definitely did not.   <br /> <br />There are very few movies I truly detest for boring me to tears.  In fact, the only other one I can think of right now is \\"The Bridges of Madison County\\".   <br />
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Even if you are not a fan of this type of music, you have to admit they sure can play! I found most bands of this type to be very generic and not that talented. This is one of the few exceptions. Great songwriting and excellent execution. I swear I have had this in my cd changer for a year. This band singlehandedly resparked my interest in metal.
B00008976Y|4.0|The first of Kryzysztof Kieslowski's colour-titled films based on the French tricoleur flag and also from the French Revolutionary concept of Liberte, Egalite, et Fraternite, is Bleu.<br /><br />Julie de Courcy has survived an automobile accident that has taken the life of her husband, a renowned contemporary composer, and five year-old daughter Anna.  Uncertain and abandoned, she is determined to make a new start for herself, leaving behind traces of the past, especially as it turns out she was the one writing the music for her husband's compositions.  When I say survived, maybe I mean physically.  Emotionally and spiritually, she may as well have been a casualty.<br /><br />Leaving her large countryside mansion, she rents a spacious apartment in Paris.  It is more than just her past she is leaving.  She is also getting away from Olivier, a colleague of her late husband who has been in love with her all these years.  However, despite her attempts to remain an anonymous nonentity, some loose threads from her past need to be tied up.  Her husband Patrice was working on a concerto, the anthem for the European Union, which is Beethovenesque given some strong strings and a chorale.  A young man who witnessed the accident tracks also tracks her down.  And later, she learns that her husband had a mistress, and after learning from Olivier that he knew, decides to confront the woman.  The past also goes deep into a fear for rats that infest her apartment.<br /><br />Her attempt at noninvolvement also fails.  When a neighbour tries to get her to sign a petition demanding the eviction of a tenant, a loose woman, Julie refuses saying it's not her business.  Later, the woman, Lucille, arrives at Julie's flat with flowers, joyful that because not all the tenants signed, she is allowed to stay in the apartment building.  Julie later discovers Lucille works at a strip club.  When asked why she does it, Lucille says she likes it and everybody does.  The garish though briefly seen club scenes are a diametric opposite to what Julie's trying to achieve through her gloomy solitude.<br /><br />The theme of blue can be seen whenever Julie goes to the swimming pool.  The pool's bottom is reflected blue from the lights, symbolizing Julie's attempt to reenergize herself in her newfound liberation. Yet the implication here is that despite achieving liberty, or being Blue, one does so at the cost of destroying one's soul.  The liberty might as well be as hollow as the glass or crystal as those of the chandelier ornament Julie takes with her.  Sure it's pretty, but so what?  Is it spiritually or emotionally nourishing?  Or the blue lollipop wrapped in the blue Julie crunches down forcefully.  It seems equivalent to forcing liberty by the throat instead of making it a comfortable blanket.<br /><br />As Julie, Juliette Binoche turns in what's one of her best roles ever alongside her roles in The Unbearable Lightness of Being and The English Patient.  She isn't a grieving widow, but one who has decided to go through her life and tying up her past in her own way.  I give this 4.3 stars, rounded down and not a 5 because of Red, which I liked the best.  But I like this deeper shade of blue.  Benoit Regent gives credible support as her tempered yearner, Olivier.  Charlotte Very also stands out as Lucille.  And that's Emmanuelle Riva (Hiroshima Mon Amour) as Julie's senility-ridden mother.<br /><br />The story was also written by famed Polish director Agnieszka Holland, the woman behind Europa Europa.  Kieslowski followed this with Blanc and Rouge.seen club scenes are a diametric opposite to what Julie's trying to achieve through her gloomy solitude. <br /> <br />The theme of blue can be seen whenever Julie goes to the swimming pool.

B0001UL7RY|5.0|God Save The Queen -- The Rodney On The Rock's Danger Field & Screamer -- The I Get No Street Cred And TRL Can Just Go To Hellion. For 10,000,000 Avril Fans Can't Be Wrong. <br /> <br />I don't know about you but in these hazy days when you can't tell oh how convenient from compassionate conservatism, when homeland security is obscenity who really cares all is tony blair, when this real old nowhere man knows he's got no home to go to, he makes a date to dance with the better angel of his nature, to ignore all alien orders and to get real gone for a change inside Avril's overflowing \\"Na Na, Na Na Na[s]\\" ...just to do some dreaming upside her song, \\"He Wasn't.\\" <br /> <br />Now when the Straight People defeated The Rockers back on a cold dark rainy day in early November 2004, I went straight into the blues bin. A few daze later I emerged and somehow managed to throw on the album Under My Skin, and then along came Avril. And then she hit me like a diamond shot through the middle of my skull and she rightened by lightening my ship, even if but for the fleeting moment of a sweet little epiphany. In the midst of her pop-punk war against deep dark depression, the sunlight of joy in \\"Who Knows\\" wins the battle of the day. In the context of this album and these times, suddenly the saints come marching in and triumphantly bring it on: \\"Who knows what could happen/ Do what you do/ Just keep on laughing...\\" Now Nietzsche warned that \\"Hope is the worst of evils, for it prolongs the torments of man,\\" but try and live for long without just a little bit of it. <br /> <br />Avril may party like a sinner but she has the voice of an angel, even if she has the edge of a deviled-ham showgirl. She has the insight of one sinned against as well: \\"Nobody's Home\\" is transcendent pop poetry. The words swim the depths of despair as the song spins in the air: \\"...Her feelings she hides/ Her dreams she can't find/ She's losing her mind/ She's falling behind/ She can't find her place/ She's losing her faith/ She's falling from grace/ She's all over the place yeah...\\" Beautifully sad and empathetic, it recalls the 1990's hit by Soul Asylum, \\"Runaway Train,\\" but with both an update and an upgrade. <br /> <br />Both hard rock and alternative radio won't play the Canadian Queen Dream that is the La La Lavigne, even though she blows U2's latest \\"atomic bomb\\" completely out of the water. The Grammy Award nominations and the many Best Of 2004 Lists I've read all completely overlooked Avril. They blew it, man.  <br /> <br />\\"Nobody's Home\\" is the best pop ballad of the year. Meanwhile Avril's big funtime and yet emotional rescue of herself that is Under My Skin, got way under and saved my skin like no other pop-punk-rock album of 2004.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|I really liked this movie and thought it was funny, but the rest of the family didnt like it. There is alot of stuff in the movie that us americans wont understand, not just because of the different sayings but some of the stuff you just cant understand what there saying lol. You have to follow the movie to understand some of the jokes and other stuff thats going on or you might not think its funny and thats what i kept telling my dad. he needs to watch it again and actually watch it. <br />There wasnt anything over done in the movie either. which is always good
068987474X|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was hilarious, full of thought, and definitely a real eye opener. However, I've tried to share some of the wisdom from the book, and a majority of my friends just \\"don't want to hear it.\\" Come to think of it, who really does want to hear, \\"He's just not that into you,\\" over and over and over again until you finally get the message? Well, aparently a lot of people do because this book was a New York Times best seller. <br /> <br />At times, the book was hard to read. It was hard to realize that the infamous \\"I don't want to ruin the friendship\\" excuse was not valid, or that \\"I'm married, but I hate her\\" was also a loud of crap. It's hard to hear. It honestly is. But after I finished the book, I honestly felt a lot better. Even if I didn't want to hear all of the advice Greg gave, it was nice to know it. Why would you turn down the advice? Even if you don't want to hear it, it's better to endure the pain than to continue living a miserable life with a boyfriend, husband, or friend that is \\"just not that into you.\\" <br /> <br />Conclusion? I loved the book. I absolutely loved it. But some others haven't. Buy the book if you're ready to hear it. Want to still live in fantasy land? Then don't buy it.
0380977788|5.0|This book was creepy but I was enthralled by it.  I will never look at buttons the same again.
B000069CWE|5.0|LP's done it again. They've released another disc that totally rules. I wouldn't say that I'm a rap fan, but Linkin Park makes rap sound good.  <br /> <br />They seem to have split the album into halves. The first half is the rapper's side, and the second half is the rocker's side. The first half has a mostly rap feel to it, but has heavy guitars with it to keep it from going all-out rap. The music is awesome in FRGT/10, as it accents the lyrics very well and makes it the most awesome rap song that I've heard since \\"Come With Me\\". They use the same tactics in the other rap songs, aswell. The [RIFF RAFF] cuts the halves nicely; it makes it very easy to cross from rap to rock. <br /> <br />On the rock side (second half), they focus more on heavy funk/rock phrases and wicked beats to keep the album rollin'. Songs like 'BY MYSLF' and '1STP KLOSR' are very heavy tunes that can easily become the favorite for us metal fans out there. Jon Davis doesn't blow his top in 1STP KLOSR (Like he does in most KoRn songs), and actually sounds like he belongs in it. KRWLNG is a good cool-down song, and makes you want to hit the loop button. <br /> <br />If there is any problems with it, it would be 'ENTH E ND'. It doesn't really appeal to me, because it is pure rap. But that's just me. <br /> <br />As a bonus, the PTS.OF.ATHRTY video on the CD-ROM part of the CD is wicked awesome. Be sure to have Quicktime so you can watch it! <br /> <br />Overall, this is probably my favorite LP album. It has a pretty psychadelic feel to it, which keeps you awake and listening. All the songs are very different, which is a plus. I say, buy it. Buy it now.
1573225517|2.0|I thought Nick's life was really depressing, even though it's probably the truth.  I mean, his relationship is falling apart, he works in a record store and well, he doesn't think about anything besides his past failures.  Also, he kept talking and talking about music, and which kinds are 'cool' or whatever.  Overall, I really felt down in the dumps after reading this book because it made me wonder if my future will be like that.
B00000JLWW|5.0|I respectfully disagree with Skittles version of the movie and anyone else that hates the movie simply because they know the Titanic sank. I knew it too. That doesn't take away from the fact that it's a good story and a good effects movie. Movies aren't based on truth all the time, so why is telling a story that is likely to not happen a farce? We all see movies that couldn't possbily be true, what we like to call \\"Movie Magic\\". One thing is completely wrong, you can fall in love at first sight. I know it's true because it has happened to me. An undying love that will last for as long as we are both alive. There's some great story to tell, they might as well make a movie out of it. Since it's the highest money making movie ever, we're apparently not all wrong. IMHO
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Edgar Wright's \\"SHAUN OF THE DEAD\\" is an absolute zombie masterpiece! This movie is the \\"RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD\\" of this generation. Like Dan Obannon's \\"R.O.T.L.D\\" this is a zombie parody that will turn out to be more of a classic than the countless zombie classic's that inspired them. \\"SHAUN\\" is 1 of a very small # of absolutely flawless zombie movies! its perfect! you can't complain about anything! its just one GUT-WRENCHING HELLA GORE TIME! In my opinion Zack Snyder's \\"DAWN 04\\" & Edgar Wright's \\"SHAUN OF THE DEAD\\" have SAVED a genre that was on life support & is now alive & living very well in the hearts of new & younger zombie fans like my 9 year old little brother who loved both movies & keeps hounding me to watch all the zombie classics that i have collected over the years. that tell's ya somthing doesn't it?! I thank both Zack Snyder & Edgar Wright for making such great new classic's & also for turning my 9 year old little brother into a new generation zombie fan!!!(i can't wait to introduce him to Fulci). so zombie fans hurry up & get your \\"SHAUN\\" dvd its got some great special features to go along with the great flick you can't go wrong here!!!! ENJOY!
0671027387|3.0|I was intrigued by Dan Brown's first novel The Da Vinci Code, and although I found many flaws to it, I still couldn't put it down (the short chapters might have been something to do with it). I then saw Deception Point and tried it out. What I found was a very similar formula, and as in the Da Vinci Code, you can work out who the villain is going to be about half-way through the book partly because there are so few characters and no more are going to be introduced, and partly because it's a Dan Brown novel, so the reader is expecting there to be a huge twist anyway. I cannot say that I was \\"blown away\\"  or massively impressed by Deception Point. On the other hand, I couldn't put it down. I found the plot to be weaker than the historically fascinating 'Angels and Demons' and 'The Da Vinci Code' but overall it was a decent read.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I never thought I'd say this about a movie associated with MTV but I really enjoyed this one. The characterization is perfect, they couldn't have casted this movie any better.
B00005JN2X|3.0|Why is this different?<br /><br />Because I'm the only one here who's citing the source of this film.  Collateral is NOT an original idea.  It has its roots in a 1993 Japanese film directed by Masato Harada called Kamikaze Taxi in which a young Yakuza hires a taxi driver to take him around to the homes or hangouts of the men responsible for his girlfriend's death and the deaths of several of his friends.  These include his Yakuza boss, Yakuza soldiers, and a corrupt, sleazy senator.<br /><br />While not the same story--Collateral takes off from the above to involve Jamie Foxx as the driver in a ruthless series of hits by anti-hero Tom Cruise, totally unrelated to revenge--the basic concept is the same.  In fact, Collateral is much less credible than Kamikaze Taxi.  Why wouldn't the hitman kill the taxi driver once the latter recognizes what the hitman is and what he's doing?  Just to avoid having to take another cab?  Not likely.  This glaring point of non-credibility weakens the story considerably, even though Cruise is really good and believable as a hitman (truly vicious), and Foxx is equally as good in his role.<br /><br />It's interesting that the screenwriter chose not to do an American version of Kamikaze Taxi directly, but instead twist the plot somewhat to try to make it look original and, possibly, more \\"American\\".  Nevertheless this is too close for comfort to Harada's film which is now available on DVD and is an interesting piece of work.<br /><br />The three stars here are for the performances by both Cruise and Foxx which are admittedly quite good.
B0002ZMIU8|2.0|I've been a huge fan of Da Ali G Show, and knew a feature film couldn't come close to the outrageous originality of da show.  Still, \\"Ali G Indahouse\\" isn't half bad and if you're a fan at all, it's certainly worth a viewing, just to see some familiar names fleshed out.  There are some genuinely funny moments - but it's obvious that the (at least seemingly) spontaneous quality of the series can't really be replicated for \\"da film.\\" <br /> <br />Sasha Baron Cohen is brilliant with this (and his other characters), but I hope in the future if Ali wants to get in \\"da movies\\" he sits back, watches a few episodes of the show and decides to keep doing what he does best. <br /> <br />
B0002X314C|5.0|I've been listening to this cd constantly since I bought it the day it was released.  I agree with others who have said this is one of those that you can listen to over and over again without skipping a single song.  It's the combination of Legend's voice, lyrics, and style that combine to make this album absolutely one of the best of 2004.  He reminds me of a cross between Carl Thomas and Anthony Hamilton with a little Marvin Gaye thrown in.  I obviously love the whole thing, but my favorites are \\"Alright,\\" \\"Number One,\\" and \\"Stay With You.\\"
B0000CDLA7|4.0|I think this cd is very good. All the songs are good, and each and every one has their own high points. The band sounds awsome on this cd. still progressive as hell, and well written. they are just a bit heavier then usual. they still sound great anyway. I dont know why so many people trashed this cd. its a really good cd. Just open your mind and apriciate the experimenting this band always does. this cd is deffedently worth the money.

B00030590I|5.0|I object to the \\"Crouching Tiger\\" comparisons.  Treating violence as ballet is more suitably attributable to Sam Peckinpah's \\"The Wild Bunch\\" or 1939's \\"Jesse James\\" or even \\"The Matrix\\", all of which treated the action that way.  The dramatic beauty and color palette are more attributable to \\"The Scarlett Empress\\" and \\"Lost Horizon\\".  If \\"Hero\\" and \\"Crouching Tiger\\" have anything in common, it is that they both serve their purposes, and this means they have nothing in common.  They have one supporting actress in both films, and the same music composer.  Perhaps the director knew what he wanted to stay away from when dealing with his first martial arts film: namely, typical martial arts films.  Aside from that, the two are completely different, and \\"Hero\\" is a better film.  \\"Crouching Tiger\\" surprised many people with it's \\"Disney-esque\\" or \\"Wizard Of Oz\\" fantasy plot and visuals, but \\"Hero\\" defines the understanding of the secret developments of real warriors.<br /><br />  The truth of \\"Hero\\" comes through the balletic violence.  The film is more about what causes a development within a soldier through an act of non-violence.  In a way, the balletic violence is no different from the other love scenes in the movie.  Really, the film is not a film with mindless violence, (like most martial arts films.)  It is a film about ending war by submitting oneself to ideals above the lines on a map regardless of death, when death serves peace or love.  Would you not welcome death if it served love?  What is the purpose for war?  This is a good movie, above the average intelligence.

0062502182|5.0|I loved this book because it made me change how i saw the world and people. I think that all the people that hated it didn't take the time to try to understand the book's message. You can read the book in many different ways, because it is a simple straight forward tale. If you cannot read between the lines and see the depth in the characters and need some author to baby you through character development and plot with lavish words then you probably won't like this book. However if you are a person willing to dream and change how you see the world i would read this book.
B0001L3LUE|2.0|After listening to the inept, revisionist McNamara ramble on in this film, one wonders what's next -- a documentary from Jimmy Carter on how to be a great president?  Step one: create double-digit interest rates. Step two: stand impotent in the face of terrorists holding Americans hostage for 444 days in Tehran... <br /> <br />What a shame America abandoned the people of South Vietnam, who were then steamrolled by the Soviet-backed North Vietnamese army, where millions of South Vietnamese were then murdered in communist \\"re-education camps,\\" or died while fleeing into the open sea in small boats to escape the communist onslaught from the North. <br /> <br />The film gets two stars because it's at least instructive to observe the failed McNamara flailing about. <br />
B000021Y7X|5.0|Filmed at the apex of their tour for Speaking In Tongues at Hollywood's Pantages Theater, the combined efforts of David Byrne's storyboarded presentation (from literally empty stage to full ensemble plus offbeat choreography - dancing with lamps and running marathons around the stage, not to mention the now iconic 'big suit'), and director Jonathan Demme and cinematographer Jordan Cronenweth's superb camera and lighting work create a concert film experience like no other.  Not only are there no 'MTV'-style quick-cut edits ('Once In A Lifetime' is done in virtually one long uncut take), and cuts to other members of the band at what would normally seem to be inopportune times give the viewer a sense of playful intimacy rarely seen in concert videos made ever since.    My own exprience in TH albums prior to the film and soundtrack album came only with 'Remain In Light' and 'Speaking In Tongues' when they were first released, but the film made me a fan of everything they did musically before and after, and it is a sad reality that there has never been another band like them since they called it quits.    The film only covers about half of their stage show from that tour, but there are so many highlights, simply beginning with David Byrne's awkward dance to the opening 'Psycho Killer' (reworked with only David, an acoustic guitar and Roland drum machine) performed on a virtually empty stage, as one-by-one we are introduced to all the players in this little drama.    When most filmmakers find the band boring, there are usually hundreds of jump cuts to the audience or behind the scenes taking the audience out of the experience ('The Last Waltz' and 'The Song Remains The Same' come easily to mind).  Fortunately, the focus is entirely on the band - the audience in the theater is treated like the audience in the concert, and the only time the camera breaks away to the crowd is at the absolute end of the show, and we see that the original audience has been loving every minuteof it, dancing in their seats or grooving in the aisles - this is just a fun concert film that you can't but help move to, and don't be embarassed if you start dancing, too.    Oh, there's some bonus stuff on there too, (like David Byrne's self-interview and two - three if you consider the second is a medley - excised songs from the original extended VHS release taken from an old 1\\" videotape master) but you'll get more mileage out of the restored concert footage, which looks rich and sounds stunning thanks to 3 separate mixes - PCM stereo, theatrical 5.1 and 'studio' 5.1 versions (the theatrical mix is really the best).    To borrow from David Byrne, overdubbed in post-production for the intermission break, \\"Does anybody have any questions?\\"
B00005NTN5|5.0|Before the (godawful) Matrix series, the Wachowski brothers gave filmgoers the erotic \\"Bound\\" starring Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly. I am by far no fan of Jennifer Tilly, her voice irritates me to no ends of the earth. Plus most of her films that I have seen her in have been pretty bad but surprisingly enough I liked her in \\"Bound\\". \\"Bound\\" is one of my favorite films from the '90s.<br /><br />Gina Gershon stars as Corky, a convicted felon who had just gotten out of prison. She lands a job that involved fixing up an apartment in a seedy apartment building. There she meets Violet (Jennifer Tilly), the girlfriend to the psychotic, abusive Caesar (Joe Pantoliano). The two women literally hook up together within minutes of the movie. Normally that would happen in the middle of a film but the Wachowski brothers decided to avoid the cliche and put the love scene in the first 15-20 minutes of the film. I read that erotica expert Susie Bright was hired as a consultant in the film for the love scenes between the two actresses. I thought the love scenes were pretty convincing, a lot more than in most mainstream films that involves lesbian love scenes. After hooking up with Corky and listening to Caesar and his mob buddies punish another mobster, Violet realizes that she wants to get out of this life once and for all. She recruits Corky's help to help steal $2 million from the mob (which is in Caesar and Violet's apartment) and skip town with it.<br /><br />I am not really into gangster films but \\"Bound\\" is by no means your traditional gangster film. I found the writing engaging and the performances by the Gina Gershon, Jennifer Tilly, and Joe Pantoliano entertaining. For people who might be faint at heart, there is a lot of bloodshed in the film but no more than in most films nowadays. Still the scene with Caesar and his mob buddies torturing another mobster made me cringe, no matter how many times I have seen the film. I thought the dialogue was hilarious although it bordered on hokeyness like when Violet says to Corky that she was glad that she [Corky] told her about her time in prison. Another cheesy moment was when Violet was talking to Corky over the phone and both women placed their hands on the wall in the exact spot where each other's hands were in each different room. \\"Law & Order: Special Victim Unit\\" star Christopher Meloni (with a lot more hair) makes a cameo appearance as the stupid, psychotic mobster Johnny. I loved it when Johnny would find a way to irritate Caesar.<br /><br />I wish movies today were as engaging and fast-paced \\"Bound\\" was. What I really liked about \\"Bound\\" is that the film didn't drag on for an eternity. It was fast paced. I thought the way the film was edited gave the film viewer a glimpse to what was to expect from the Wachowksi brothers. There were moments when I felt that the film had that same feel in cinematography that the first \\"Matrix\\" film had. Great movie. Certainly one of my favorite movies from the past decade.t bordered on hokeyness like when Violet says to Corky that she was glad that she [Corky] told her about her time in prison.

0316777722|5.0|David Sedaris has emerged as one of the funniest and wisest voices of the last decade. He has the endearing ability to mine his painful childhood and his unsuccessful early adulthood, emerging with nuggets of wit and rich humor. He also has the dreadful power to translate uncomfortable experiences into discomforting reading. I can't think of another writer whose pain and humiliations are so literally gut-wrenching.<br /><br />\\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is a compilation of stories having language as their theme, centering on Sedaris's own pathetic attempts to learn French. His classics include \\"Jesus Shaves\\" -- a hilarious vignette of beginner French students trying to explain Easter to a Muslim student; \\"Go Carolina\\" -- a bittersweet memory of being singled out to correct a speech \\"impediment\\" common with unpopular kids; \\"12 Moments In The Life Of The Artist\\" -- a skewering of the pretensions of performance art;  \\"I'll Eat What He's Wearing\\" -- Sedaris describing his father's peculiar eating habits. Sedaris's sense of the absurd is almost superfluous; all he needs to do is describe the weird people he encounters (attracts?) In any event, Sedaris draws the listener eagerly back for more of his tales of the bizarre and the all-too-recognizable.<br /><br />I highly recommend the audio CD, voiced by Sedaris himself. His tinny and timid voice is a perfect cover for his ironic barbs. Several of his stories were recorded before live audiences. These are actually less successful than his straight readings, transforming Sedaris's understated humor into a string of guffaw lines. It was somewhat like trying to enjoy the subtleties of a fine wine when at every sip, the folks at the neighboring table boorishly sing its praises. Nevertheless, it's heartening that this son of failure has found his muse and ridden to fame.
B00005JN4O|5.0|Finding Neverland is the story about how Sir James Barrie inspired by a widowed family and wrote the all time classics Peter Pan.<br /><br />James (Johnny Depp) was having a serious writer block and his last work flopped badly. He was in need of inspiration and his marriage was on the rocks. Fate brought him to meet the widowed family of Sylvia Davies (Kate Winslet), whose deceased husband left her 4 boys on her own. Through interactions with the boys, each having their own character, James weaved together a masterpiece that originally was thought of insane, but then turned to be the classic that everyone now still reads and enjoys.<br /><br />Johnny Depp gave a spectacular performance again as James Barrie. Not that he put on an accent for the role, but the way he re-created James Barrie as a living character again. The struggle he exhibited for his career, the way how he wanted to solve the marriage problem and yet tried to avoid it, the straight innocence and purity for his care of the boys, and his crazy and imaginative way of telling his stories. Johnny Depp handled every single aspect of the character with a magic touch and yet you could see any side of his character fell apart from the main body. The scenes in which he told Sylvia his childhood secret. and the last scene with Peter were just so well done that you just got drawn into the world of James Barrie and felt that you were there.<br /><br />Kate Winslet as Syvia Davies gave a good turn of her character choice compared to her other movies. She re-lived the life of a woman who contributed her life for her 4 sons. She was worn out by life, she was living through grief, and yet she still wanted to believe that imagination could be solution to problems. You could feel her pain inside her glances from time to time. The character choice was great.<br /><br />The supporting cast was also great. Nick Roud who played George and Freddie Highmore who played Peter were two of the more outstanding ones in terms of performance opportunities. Both were boys who were forced to grow up because of the mishappening at home, but deep inside they wish they could still live a life as a boy of their parents. They are the muse for James and thus eventually named the main character in his play after Peter.<br /><br />Finding Neverland is about the retention of childhood, imagination and creativity in the grown up world. It is the desire to remind the audience about, what matters inside your mind and make believe is the energy of life, no matter what the situation is. This is why James Barrie reserved seats for a group of kids on the opening night, despite the opposition of the theatre manager. It was only through the laughter of the kids that, the audience felt relax and could actually enjoy the imagination and creativity provided by the Neverland.<br /><br />The movie itself has quite a bit of sad elements in it, however, because of what we saw the characters were trying to do, even after weeping (yeah you could hear people weeping in the cinema) you would still feel very good about the movie. The subtle positive energy delivered by the movie would make you to remember it, feel it and appreciate it. The soundtrack accompanying the movie is also marvellous. The tune just fit perfectly into the world of the movie and helped carry the emotion to the audience vividly.<br /><br />Finding Neverland could easily be one of the best movies of the year, without shedding blood, cutting limbs, or any 100 million dollar special effect. In fact, just looking at how older day's theatre tried to expand their imagination on their stage design is already a pleasure. It is not a moving to be missed during this post holiday season.n terms of performance opportunities.

B00030590I|4.0|Watching \\"Hero\\" for the first time was difficult. Who is the hero? Is he the supposed slayer of assassins he claims to be? Or is he hiding other motives? Are the assassins ruthless, cold murders? Or metaphysical poets of calligraphy and swordplay? A second viewing is required to absorb the subtleties of the portrayals.<br /><br />The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. Each scene is saturated in a particular hue -- crimson, emerald, gold -- requiring an artist's palette to keep track of the color changes. The Chinese scenery is almost mythical in its beauty. The acting is alternately taut -- with movement kept to an absolute minimum -- and expansive, as in the many fight scenes.<br /><br />\\"Hero\\" is a movie of visual poetry, martial valor and physical tension. Though the use of wires in martial arts movies is now familiar to the point of clich&eacute;, their use in this film was astoundingly complex. The locations are extraordinary -- from a miraculously still lake to an autumn whirlwind of golden falling leaves. Thought the plot is rather spare, \\"Hero\\" is beautiful to watch.
6302212529|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater when I was really young clear back in 1989. It was only the second time I had been to the movies. I thought it was so good that I got it on VHS the following year.    It's a tale that's great for young and old alike. It's also a movie that everyone has seen, at least in my circle of friends. The soundtrack is good, the animation is wonderfully done, and even a guy in the 18-21 range (myself included) can get a good laugh or two out of it.    This is a film the current generation of teens will wind up passing on to their children ten years from now. Destined to go down next to Snow White and Bambi as a Disney masterpiece, Little Mermaid comes highly recommended for anyone with young children (or anyone who is either young at heart or has a sudden feeling of nostalgia).
B000004166|5.0|This is what I felt when I finally got to listen to these concertos after couple of years of intense searching. Although technically maybe not so difficult as said everywhere, I found them extremely difficult as far as music and 'the ritght tone' goes. Horowitz once said that nowadays people play Mozart like Chopin and vice-versa. And this is true for many of the recordings with violin concertos. None I've listened before really told the story of these concertos. I got as close as I could with Mutter/Karajan and Perlman/Levine. Yet sometimes the violin was to impersonal (Mutter) or the orchestra not quite on the subject (Levine). This Chrismas I finally got to listen to Grumiaux of which I've heard before and let me tell you this: everything you read here is true. Grumiaux is playing the whole Mozart in these concertos. I'd go as far as to say that is is one of the best Mozart 'incarnations' in sound in all recorded music history. He is elegant, wonderful and full of understading phrasing. Everything is there in full range. Colin Davis does, as usual, a great job accompanying an outstanding performance in every aspect. Even those of you who only enjoy a very good recorded sound have all the reasons to be happy. It hardly can get better than this. But Grumiaux deserves all appraisals above all. What he does is extreme and sweet justice to Mozart and to his music.
B00005UKE0|5.0|RELEASED IN 1970, GEORGE HARRISONS \\"ALL THINGS MUST PASS\\" HAS BECOME WITHOUT A DOUBT, HIS SIGNATURE ALBUM. WITH THE TWO HITS \\"MY SWEET LORD\\" AND \\"WHAT IS LIFE\\" YOU CAN NOT MISS WITH THIS ALBUM. ALTHOUGH GEORGE WOULD RELEASE OTHER GREAT WORKS OF ART, THIS RELEASE WOULD SET THE TONE OF WHAT WOULD COME. \\"WAH-WAH\\", \\"ISN'T IT A PITY\\", \\"LET IT DOWN\\" AND \\"BEWARE OF DARKNESS\\" ARE EXCEPTIONAL TRACKS. HARRISON ALSO HAD THE HELP OF SOME LEGENDARY ARTISTS FOR THE RECORDING OF THIS ALBUM, WITH THE LIKES OF ERIC CLAPTON, RE-KNOWN STEEL GUITAR MASTER PETE DRAKE, THE MEMBERS OF BADFINGER, AND ALSO PHIL COLLINS OF GENESIS, WITH PHIL SPECTOR PRODUCING. IN CONTRAST, THE ALBUM AS A WHOLE HAS, A NICE EVEN FLOW, WITH BEAUTIFUL HARMONIES AND SHOULD BE IN ANY MUSIC FANS COLLECTION. A GREAT ALBUM BY A LEGENDARY FIGURE, WHO CAME FROM A LEGENDARY BAND. R.I.P. GEORGE.
0385510438|5.0|Mr. Grisham remembered the first rule of fiction that he followed in A Time to Kill.  He wrote what he knew.  He finally returns to Clanton, Mississippi with both a great legal story (with the legal inaccuracies Mr. Grisham admits) and great characters - many of whom the reader will recognize from A Time to Kill.  Despite the fact that the main character is a journalist rather than an attorney, this book strikes some of the same tones as A Time to Kill.   <br /> <br />I have always thought A Time to Kill was Mr. Grisham's best book.  The Last Juror is on the same level.  The characters are fascinating.  The story is intriguing and has just enough twists and turns to be believable.
B000062YAZ|5.0|What a genius quality metal album this is, Slayer's masterpiece 'Reign In Blood', and only 1 minute short of being a full half hour. Excellent. Kerry King & Jeff Hanneman blast through a fury of riffs that just don't stop! They shread like true mothers, and the solo's are just the pit of the entire thing, not to mention the awesome drumming! I'm glad Dave Lombardo decided to rejoin Slayer again, considering in my lifetime I've only witnessed the band with Paul Bostaph on the drums.  <br />'Raining Blood' & 'Angel Of Death' are great thrash metal tunes to annoy the neighbours to, and are just pure anthem's that really gave other metal pioneers such as Megadeth, Metallica, & Anthrax (whom are bands I really like too!) a run for their money! <br />If you want the speediest Slayer album ever! Then this is as far as you need to go!
B00003CXRM|5.0|Every few years, among the dung heap of crappy movies comes along a masterpiece. This is one of them. Ok, it's not Gone With The Wind, but it's still a classic.  You leave the film wanting more, but knowing a sequel would be a let down. You play back certain parts in your mind, and you wish to watch the movie over, and when you do, you take away even more from the film - my definition of a classic. Who would give this less than 4 stars? I knew it before I even looked, but I looked anyway - Holy-rollers. They can't stand anything that slaps religion in the face.  I've been saved.... My sins have been washed away..... even from that piggly wiggly I robbed.... If you can't laugh at something like that, either get the starch out of your collar, or don't buy or rent movies. Just put your money in the offering plate.
1400032717|5.0|I will keep it short and sweet, much like the book at hand.  I bought this book on a whim, knowing my roommate at school had read it and said it was good, plus i needed something to take my mind off of reality a bit.  I found myself reading it every chance i got, wanting so desperately to find out what happened next.  The title is rather deceiving, but plays terrifically into ones presupposition of the book... that it's about a dog.  Christopher Boone is one of the most intriguing characters i have ever followed within a novel.  The author, Mark Haddon, has created himself a gem and i am greatly looking forward to his next novel.
B00009ATIX|5.0|Soy un amante de las peliculas en las cuales el casting, la fotografia, las actuaciones, la musica, la direccion, etc. forman un todo en armonia que le agrega valor a la pelicula. Solaris, es para mi, una agradable sorpresa. Segun las criticas que habia escuchado por ahi, era una peli?cula mas del monton, asi que cuando la vi, no tenia grandes expectativas. Pero tuve la oportunidad de juzgar por cuenta propia, y tengo que decir que resulto de esas en las que uno se prende de tal modo en la trama, que cuando termina se queda con ganas de ver mas. Y como broche de oro, me encanta esta peli?cula en cuanto a que deja muchas preguntas a criterio del espectador:\\"Muchas preguntas y pocas respuestas\\" Como dijo alguna vez el Capitan Jean-Luc Picard.  Mejor no podia ser. Creo que va a entrar en mi lista de peliculas que las veo una y otra vez.
0767834739|4.0|This is very similar to the George Romero Dawn of the Dead Movies with similar zombies trying to eat the living.  This was caused by an experiment gown awry.  The group of people in this one are in a cordoned off city looking for the daughter of the scientist who caused the mess. <br /> <br />The female action hero is excellent (reminicent of Gena Davis in The Long Kiss Goodnight) and the action is well choreographed.
B000002TQV|5.0|I don't know where to begin... <br /> <br />OK, now I do. <br /> <br />I was introduced to Radiohead through a burned copy of Amnesiac. BIG MISTAKE!!! The songs were much too wierd. I was currently getting into rock legends like Zeppelin, The Doors and Hendrix. I simply could not enjoy such wierdness as \\"Pull/Pulk Revolving Doors\\", \\"Packt like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box\\", and \\"Life In A Glass House\\". Still, I admired the slow, sometimes haunting beauty of \\"Morning Bell\\", \\"You And Whose Army\\", \\"Pyramid Song, \\"Knives Out\\", \\"Dollars and Cents\\", and \\"Hunting Bears\\". So, I ordered The Bends used for a few dollars. <br /> <br />This has been one of the greatest choices in my life. <br /> <br />I pop the CD into my computer, turn it loud, and press PLAY for track 1. The blizzard-like sound rushes from speaker to speaker and seems to ascend into the air like a flock of birds. The piano finally slams into the song and echoes loudly like a hammer to my speakers as the slick yet booming drums go along perfectly. I, enthralled and glued to my seat, crack a smile as I stare at my computer screen mindlessly like a labotomized elephant. It was a sublime experience I'll never forget. <br /> <br />Planet Telex, which I described, is an excellent standout track with Thom yelling \\"Everything is broken, everyone is broken!!\\" The follow-up track, The Bends, is a masterfully composed rocker that sounds like nothing I've ever listened to. The acoustic High And Dry; an unfogettable anthem that simply demands to be heard. The gorgeous, elegant Fake Plastic Trees is about whateer you want it to be. So unstructured...I like that! Bones, a nice and short rocker. Nice Dream is a great track which will grow boring to the impatient. But those two tracks that are the least memorable are immediately followed up by the catchy, rocking, commanding song Just; such a classic!! The smooth, haunting futuristic riffs of My Iron Lung make for yet another worthy sequel, a song about the band's hatred forthe smash hit Creep. Bullet Proof is a memorable song, but Black Star and Sulk are instant classics. Black Star is pure catchy rockability, and the crazy computer sounds add to the pure greatness and great guitars of Sulk. But the album really ends on an awe-inspiring note with Street Spirit, a slow, beautiful, all-the-way-there ballad. <br /> <br />OVERALL, out of 10, I would give: <br /> <br />Planet Telex: 10 <br />The Bends: 9.5 <br />High And Dry: 10 <br />Fake Plastic Trees: 10 <br />Bones: 8.5 <br />Nice Dream: 9 <br />Just: 10 <br />My Iron Lung: 10 <br />Bullet Proof...I Wish I Was: 8.5 <br />Black Star: 10 (YEAH!!! I LOVE THIS SONG!!! YOU WILL AT LEAST LIKE IT TOO, OR YOU'RE AN IDIOT!!!) <br />Sulk: 9.5 <br />Street Spirit: 10 <br /> <br />Yeah, pretty good rating. <br /> <br />So, if you're looking for a: <br /> <br />Rock album <br />Pop album <br />Great album <br />Album with no really explicit lyrics <br />1st Radiohead album <br />Five Star album <br />Piece Of Art <br />Album you can sing along with and rock out to <br />Album You Can Fall In Love With <br />Album known as the Best Of Radiohead <br /> <br />Then buy this.

B000002VMH|5.0|This is an awesome album.  \\"Cold\\" has been a long time favorite of mine.  It's the kind of song where you can feel the emotion put forth in lyrics and tone.  \\"Walking on Broken Glass\\" is also an awesome song.  Definitely an album to cherish!
6305364648|4.0|True Lies is probably Arnold Schwatzenegger's best movie (the other candidate might be Total Recall).  The overall story is nothing original, but there are a lot of funny, light-hearted moments and it's an entertaining movie to watch.  The Arnold is actually likeable in this film, although the other Arnold (Tom Arnold) is quite annoying.  Tia Carrere is gorgeous.  There's just a lot of action and comedy in this 1994 production.  This is a movie I've watched and will watch again many times.
B000002JSJ|5.0|I get so tired of these so-called Led Zeppelin fans always apologizing for this album. This was a great album. Moreover, Jimmy Page is on the record as saying it was his favorite album. You can tell why, the whole album is Jimmy just rockin', no other LZ album was as outgoing as this one. I love this album and consider it one of their best and I would never presume to say anything bad about Led Zeppelin.
B00005JNLY|5.0|This is one of the more enjoyable movies I have seen in the past year!  It focuses on a single Mexican mother (Flor), who is trying to raise her daughter by working two jobs.  When she realizes that she needs to spend more time with her daughter, she talks to a friend about helping her find a job that pays at least the combined salary of her two jobs. <br /> <br />The friend takes her to the home of a wealthy couple to be a housekeeper/nanny.  This is a major change for her because since she came to the US, she has not ventured outside the LA Mexican barrio.  On top of that Flor speaks zero English and the family for whom she will work for speaks no Spanish. <br /> <br />Flor also learns fast that the wealthy mother is a control freak and her restaurant owner/master chef husband (Adam Sandler) is a wimp.  The daughter is a sweet girl but badly treated by her mother because she is overweight and not \\"perfect\\" in her studies.  Flor develops a bond with the daughter and when Flor is forced to bring her own daughter to live with the family, Flor bonds with Sandler because they both have very strong ties to their daughters. <br /> <br />This movie seemed to be a tear-jerker for most of the female patrons that I saw at the theater and was a very enjoyable, fun movie for all the males.  The actress who plays Flor's daughter looks like a comer, who will be a big star someday!
B00005JNLY|5.0|This film was a real treat.  My husband and I went to this movie and we were delighted with the high quality of the story itself and the wonderful performances all around. <br /> <br />  Paz Vega is a single parent raising her daughter while working as a maid for an American family.  This is the story of how she does it while managing to keep in her own family values though being in a different culture and a different family and not speaking the language.  It's funny and heart warming, a real gem.  It's the best movie I've seen since Big Fat Greek Wedding.
B00002E23E|5.0|This video is one of my favorites, because it contains the best songs of led zeppelin albums records, \\"Dazed & cofused\\", \\"The song remains the same\\", the legendary \\"Stairway to heaven\\" and more... <br /> <br />In this concert we can appreciate deeply what means to be a star in the 70's; the hair cut, dressing, even the jimmy page old school way to play his double-guitarr... it's just magnificent, glorius and beautiful the power that contains inside... and thats why I gave to this dvd 5 stars. <br /> <br />The real power is in our heads.
006092988X|5.0|I read this book while home from school and ill in 1960.  I was 12 and very certainly male.  I still remember this vivid, moving, enthalling story while I have forgotten most any details from the usual 'thrillers' that I read in those days.   <br /> <br />I am not surprised to find that most of the reviewers are female.  The central character is a young woman, but her coming of age and coping with the realities of the human condition are pertinent to anyone, anytime.
B000002JSP|5.0|Some of the LZ fans just wanted the boys to keep recycling old blues numbers, just keep repeating what they did on I and II. However, Robert PLant and John Paul Jones wanted to go in another direction. I am glad they did. I love this album! I like the different influences on this album, in many ways, it is the most unique album they did. It has the bluesy rockers, but also has the Samba dance numbers and alternative fare as well. And I tell you what, if Jimmy had included \\"Wearing and Tearing\\" on this album, like he thought about doing, all LZ fans would be re-thinking the poor marks they gave it. Change is good and this was a good album!
B00008BRB5|5.0|By the release of SYNCHRONICITY, their fifth album, The Police were the biggest band in the world.  It came as quite a shock when the band members went their seperate ways at the peak of the group's popularity.  Fortunately, SYNCHRONICITY is as magnificent an epitaph as a band could wish for.  Since its release, the album has become nearly legendary.  The first half is great - particularly the uptempo \\"Synchronicity I\\" - but it's when one reaches the ferocious \\"Synchronicity II\\" that the album really takes off.  What follows are some of the most impressive and memorable songs to come out of the 1980's, and possibly out of rock music in general.  \\"Every Breath You Take\\", with its unforgettable guitar riff, needs no introductions; it is not only the band's signature composition, but the most requested song in the history of radio.  \\"King Of Pain\\", \\"Wrapped Around Your Finger\\", and the dreamy \\"Tea In The Sahara\\" are brilliant; \\"Murder By Numbers\\", another excellent song, was tacked on to the end of the album when it was released on CD as incentive for fans to purchase the pricier CD version.  Though the other band members contribute some compositions (Stewart Copeland's charming \\"Miss Gradenko\\", Andy Summers' bizarre \\"Mother\\"), it's clear that Sting was running the show.  The immense success of the album convinced Sting to go solo, thus ending the reign of one of the greatest bands of all time.  SYNCHRONICITY is pure gold, ranking among the finest albums of all time; it's a fitting end for such a wonderful band.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|My son doesn't write, much less write reviews, nor does he read.  He bragged the other day that he's only read one book in his entire life.  Of course, he thinks I'm a total freak because I constantly read and obviously, I write reviews here at Amazon.<br /><br />This film is, you've probably already guessed it, one of my son's all time favorite films.  He could be a salesman for it, he's sent dozens to rent it or see it at the show.  He bought the sound track.  He's seen it a dozen times already, and when he got me to sit and watch it today with him, he was constantly saying the punch lines right before they happened.  The turd.<br /><br />Anyway, so I thought it was about the most stupid and pointless flick ever, thus the three star review.  He thinks it's a five, I think a one, one plus five divided by two equals three.  Easy.<br /><br />So anyway, should you watch this?  Well, if you're actually reading this far into this review, let me guess, you'll probably think the movie is as dumb as I did, however, if you need a cool gift for a 18 something teenage boy, this is definately it, assuming the kid wasn't/isn't in fact, one of the nerdy type.  Probably my problem.<br /><br />Maybe I'm too cynical, perhaps the movie is such genius that it really is brillant after all.  Perhaps you'll have to find out for yourself, I mean, even Pulp Fiction was hated by some and loved by others.<br /><br />I'll say this; the last major scene of the film, a dance number done by the nerd in front of the school, that was well done.  You have to be really good to dance well in a bad way, if you know what I mean.  Anyway, good luck figuring out if this movie is worth seeing.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|In 1999 I had the privilege of spending close to two weeks with Madeleine as she was touring through the southeast.  She was close friends with a couple of musicians I was playing with at the time and they suggested that I meet her.  I had no idea who she was, or what she was all about, but the moment I heard her, all of my questions were laid to rest.  One month after hearing her for the first time on Dreamland, I was sitting in the same room with her, running errands with her, watching movies with her, listening to music with her and cooking gourmet meals with her.  We worked on music. She invited me into her head space with songs like Careless Love, which I still have written in the back of my Real Book from one afternoon at the piano.  Then, I had spent 10 out of my 19 years studying music in world class conservatories and she somehow graced my life with more musical insight and integrity than anyone I had ever met.  I listened with a great amount of intensity to every word of advice she gave me about my own musical career.  In the end, what I took from those two weeks was something I can only hope to impress upon you all who compare her to the late Lady Day.  Madeleine Peyroux is a woman with a voice unlike any we have heard in decades.  I am sure it confuses people when they first hear her, but only because consumers today have been starved of great singers by the popular market.  It is easier for people to accept something different when they have something great to compare it to. But make no mistake, Madeleine is a true and honest musician with a voice that weaves these beautiful strains of music that were almost forgotten into a rich masterpiece filled with texture and sincerity.  Though, to many, she sounds like Holiday, I assure you it is only by virtue of her natural ability.  She was born with a sound that resonates throughout her body and with the ability to convey her interpretations of lyrics and poetry in song.  I am certain, that no person trying to mimic the late, great musicians of jazz, would be able to accomplish what Madeleine has on Careless Love or Dreamland.  She is a unique gift to the music world and I am honored and proud to have known her.  Careless Love, Dreamland and with luck, the many more to come, will surely stand the test of time and create a well deserved place in the annals of history's great musicians.  You don't need to know her, to know that she is great.  You only need to open your ears and accept that this is music the way it should be.

B00005JMEW|5.0|When I saw the previews for Kill Bill, I didn't think it was a movie I'd like.  It was recommended to me by my sister, who loved Natural Born Killers and since I do recall liking that movie (however stoned I was whenever I watched it) I decided to give Kill Bill a chance.  I'm so glad I did! <br /> <br />The story line is kind of over the top, as are the fight scenes, but it's still such an excellent movie.  Not very much is explained in Volume 1, but I actually liked it a little better than Volume 2.  The reason being that my favorite part has to be when The Bride goes to Japan and takes out the Crazy 88 and O-Ren Ishii.  From the moment she yells \\"O-Ren Ishii you and I have unfinished business\\" till O-Ren realizes \\"That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword\\" I was completely glued to the movie.  For some reason the serenity of that winter scene of lightly falling snow in the Japanese garden has left an imprint in my mind.  I can't get it out of my head!  <br /> <br />When Volume 1 ended, and I waited for Volume 2 to start, I was saying how much I liked this movie so far and someone else asked why I liked it so much and all I could say was \\"I don't know, it's just really good.\\"  Then we all sort of agreed that that's all we could really come up with to explain why we liked it so much.  Just see it, it's worth it!   <br />
B00005JMEW|1.0|This movie is nothing but an orgy of violence. I cannot see this movie's appeal, unless you really like watching a relentless stream of hacked off limbs, blood gushing everwhere, pedophilliac rape, etc. The movie has very little plot. What truely amazes me is that I didn't turn it off earlier. <br /> <br />For Parents: If you are one of those parents that use the rating system with some latitude, don't do it here. Keep your kids away from this one. This one is sick.  <br /> <br />I think the critics must be afraid of Tarantino or something. I cannot understand how they present their reviews of this flic. I suppose that in some way the movie was art, but the critics certainly should have at least qualified their praise. It really scares me that virtually every critic I read recommended this movie without qualification. With something like this, they need to do more than just rely on the rating system.
B0002VEX7S|5.0|I don't know what it is with Canada. Sometimes it seems as though every musician I really like hails from our neighbor to the north: Gordon Lightfoot, Rush, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, and quite a few others. Including Loreena McKennitt.<br /><br />I tend to agree with other reviewers that this release doesn't really break any new ground for her. But hey, when you've got a formula that works, you might as well stick with it for an album or two.<br /><br />This stuff is just hauntingly gorgeous. I originally picked it up so that I could hear the entirety of 'Night Ride Across the Caucasus' (of which a snippet is heard in one scene of Kurt Russell's SF film _Soldier_), but her setting of Alfred Noyes's 'The Highwayman' rapidly became my favorite.<br /><br />But the main reason I'm writing this review is to comment on the DVD, since I recently upgraded to the 'limited edition'.<br /><br />It's pretty good (and please note that the _same_ DVD is released with every single 'limited edition' CD, so you only need to upgrade one CD to get it). The highlight, natch, is the (slightly abridged) video version of the lovely 'The Bonny Swans', a song that is surely one of the high points of McKennitt's career. (It's on _The Mask and Mirror_.) The half-hour 'documentary' is about as interesting as you'd expect it to be (i.e., not very, in my case, but mileage varies on this sort of thing).<br /><br />I've got a major issue with the sound, though. It sounds okay played through a television, but if you've got your DVD player's audio run through a sound system (as I do), you'll be annoyed. The volume level on this DVD is _way_ high, and the low end (where you can see the levels peaking out steadily as it plays) sounds like mud.<br /><br />Again, you won't notice if you play your DVDs through your TV. But since McKennitt and her crew went to a lot of trouble to make all that cool stuff happen down there in the bottom end, it's disappointing that the audio engineers didn't bother to preserve it -- especially since it would have been such a simple matter to _turn down the frickin' volume_.<br /><br />The DVD gets five stars for content and three for sound quality. The CD, of course, gets five stars.such a simple matter to _turn down the frickin' volume_.    The DVD gets five stars for content and three for sound quality. The CD, of course, gets five stars.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|The worst and most boring movie I have ever seen ...
B000687M48|5.0|Amazing two-disc set....the dvd is fun and entertaining, and i watched the whole concert through, and trust me, i don't like watching concerts on tv. But this one is very well-done, with good lighting, interesting special affects and a display of this band's amazing talent. the dvd also features all their music videos so far, as well as hilarious behind-the-scenes footage that will make u think &quot;look, they're normal. they're not drama queens. they're not divas or ordering other people around. they are like anyone else, eating McDonalds and having a good time!&quot;<br />then there is the live CD...no Evanescence fan should go without this!! So you think Amy Lee sounded amazing on the Fallen CD right? Wait until you hear her sing LIVE! She blows her own studio tracks out of the water! If it's possible, Evanescence is even better live than in studio! We also get the honor of hearing 4 new songs on this cd (one is a cover), and i'll summarize them for you:<br />1.Thoughtless- 5/5: this song seems to have stirred up some controversy over it's lyrics. Yes it does contain two, barely audible swear words in it, but it is not a big deal and should not be a problem. This is a cover of Korn's Thoughtless from their Untouchables CD...and it is an AMAZING cover! I personally do not like Korn, so i enjoyed this cover better than the original<br />2.Farther Away- 5/5: The drums really drive this song... the bass and drums are heavy, combined with Amy Lee's piano picking and vocals and you will be BLOWN AWAY!<br />3.Breath No More- 5/5: Possibly the best unreleased track on the CD. Amy's voice and pianist skills are really emphazised in this song. It has the ballad sound of My Immortal or Field of Innocence, but its also very different. Enjoy the Spanish guitar rifts as well ;)<br />4.Missing- 5/5: This song was recorded in the studio I believe, because it doesn't sound live. It also is NOT on the dvd, to my dissapointment. It is a very haunting song, with Amy's voice drivingthe mood and the tone throughout the song. It has the usual slow beat drums and piano, with Amy's choir-like voice acting as background music. Very good!
B00005JMUA|5.0|Kill Bill Volume 2 isn't quite as action packed as Volume 1.  This half tells more of the story and of what happened to make Bill and his team of assassins turn against The Bride in the first place.  We see The Bride continue to remove people from her hit list one by one, with Bill being the last to die.   <br /> <br />I have to admit, that after Budd buried The Bride alive, I was thinking there was no way she was gonna get out of that one but I knew she did because I knew she continued on with her list after him.  It was cool to see her training with Pai Mei really pay off! <br /> <br />The fight scene between The Bride and Elle Driver wasn't as entertaining as the fight scenes from Volume 1, but it was still disturbing in a different way.  Wow, did Elle get hers! <br /> <br />When The Bride finally finds Bill, the movie slows way down.  I actually got a little bored while they were talking.  At one point I actually felt sorry for Bill and saw a glimmer of  \\"and the two best assassins of all time ended up happily ever after.\\"  That only lasted for about three seconds though.  I was all set to see The Bride and Bill fight with their Hattori Hanzo swords and was disappointed it didn't happen.  But I do like the way she did \\"Kill Bill.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />
B00000JLWW|5.0|I watched Titanic on New Years Eve too at a party and now I am begging my mom to get on DVD for me.  We had it on laser disk but laser disk is no longer IN.  But OMG I LOVE that movie!!!!  I have always been fascinated with the Titanic.  Kate Winslet was great, Leo DiCaprio, hmmm...  Well lets just say I am not his biggest fan.  I never really liked him too much.  I don't think he had chemistry with Kate.  Kate is older than Leo and you can tell that from the movie.   But Rose in 1912 is supposed to be only 17 and Jack is supposed to be 20.  For that reason they don't look good together.  But the movie is a good choice for hopeless romantics like me and for those who would like to see the Titanic with special effects, not like in the documentaries. Those are nice, but they do not have the imagery that the movie does.
B0001906O0|5.0|Like Robert Smith himself, I always listened to the B-sides first.  It was there that you found out what a band listened to, where there influences were, what new directions they were considering.  The singles you could hear anytime on the radio.  The B's, though, that's where you got the real treasure. <br />   My favorite Cure song has always been \\"I'm Cold\\", which I heard for the first time on the B side of the Standing on the Beach cassette tape in the early 80's.  It's still my favorite.  This one song mixes all the great things about The Cure into one perfect package.  Technical effects, strange melody and off-kilter harmony, the slightly out-of-tune sounding guitar which somehow worked just right, and the tendency to add layer upon layer upon layer to a song.  This song describes the whole box set, really.  There is experimentation from the late 70's (10:15 Saturday Night, from Three Imaginary Boys), extended instrumental cuts (Another Journey by Train), psychedelia (Mr. Pink Eyes) and unabashedly cute little injokes (Do the Hansa).  And that's just the first disc. <br />   The other three discs include extended and dance mixes of singles from their 25 years of music, soundtrack singles from movies like The Crow and Judge Dredd, and covers, including Doors and Jimi Hendrix tracks done over in the Cure's inimitable style.  The set is rounded out with cuts from overseas and limited edition pressings of later albums. <br />   Nothing in this set is typical, and that's just fine.  Not everything works, as you might expect from songs that weren't chosen for albums over the years.  The commentary is very good at exploring what Smith and others in the rotating door roster of The Cure were thinking when a particular song was made, and there are things to make you smile throughout the booklet.  All in all, one of the best rarities collections of any band, since The Cure obviously did exactly what they wanted when they wanted to, and took chances where other bands would not.  I admit to being partial to the older stuff, as I am when listening to their albums, but there are gems from all periods of the band's evolution, and enough to make any fan listen for hours on end.  Highly recommended.
1400032717|5.0|My daughter is mildly to moderately autistic as just one aspect of a more complicated genetic syndrome.  Mark Haddon has his character Christopher's behaviors down so well there were times when I forgot I was reading about someone \\"odd\\" because Christopher's behavior was what I am used to in my daughter's life -- the reassurance that comes from petting a dog (they don't pet you back) or getting in a snug space so that you can be \\"hugged\\" by the firm pressure of the compartment walls, etc.  The unexpected treasure I found in this book was  that the presentation of these odd behaviors from Christopher's point of view makes them reasonable to do.  I had come to this level of understanding about my daughter (now 20) but it has been hard to explain her to someone else aside from asking the person to watch the movie Rainman.  But even Rainman is written from the brother's point of view.  As an outsider who has looked deeply into the autistic's world, I recommend this book as an excellent foray into that world with empathy, understanding, and genuine appreciation and respect.  I plan to keep copies to give people -- \\"read 10 or 20 pages and you'll understand more than I can tell you in a week\\".  You'll understand the autistic and you'll understand a lot about Mom and Dad, too.  And, oh yes, it's a very well told story as well!
068987474X|4.0|About a month ago I learned that my boyfriend of four years is married and has two children.  He had told me that he was single, never married, no kids.     I started reading this book before I found out the truth about my \\"boyfriend,\\" and it was very hard for me to read at first.  It's written like a series of Dear Abby columns, with some narrative explanations scattered throughout the book. The \\"Dear Abby\\" (or in this case \\"Dear Greg\\") letters were from women with stories just like mine; \\"my boyfriend is very busy,\\" \\"my boyfriend has committment issues,\\" \\"my boyfriend doesn't want to spend time with my family,\\" \\"my boyfriend....\\"     I kept putting the book down. I'd pick it up a few days later, read a few pages and put it down again. I didn't want to face the truth.  I am still not sure that I do.    But, as you'll read in Greg and Liz's book, we are worth more than this. We deserve to be treated better. We deserve a man that will love us AND that is available. He's Just Not That Into You: The No-Excuses Truth to Understanding Guys, helped me see that more clearly.     The book is \\"technically\\" an easy read. You can pick it up and start in the middle, or the end, or on any page, and understand it. The message is solid, we (women everywhere) are lovable, smart, beautiful, and deserve to be treated well.  Why is it that it took a man telling it to us for some of us to believe it?
B00005JMAH|5.0|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has a decidedly different feel to it than the first two Potter movies.  No doubt this is due in part to new director Alfonso Cuaron, taking over for Chris Columbus.  The movie has a darker, more serious tone to it with Harry as well as his friends showing tinges of anger that we didn't see in the first two films.<br /><br />As the film opens, Harry, in a fit on anger at his Uncle Vernon, packs up and runs away from home.  He is quickly picked up by a spectral double-decker bus that speeds him along on his way to the pickup point for Hogwart's.  Harry soon learns that a dangerous and murderous wizard named Sirius Black has escaped Azkaban prison, and that he was a servant of Voldemort's that betrayed Harry's parents and now wants to kill Harry.  Thus begins a tangled plot of deception, mis-conceptions, in what ends up as almost a who-done-it kind of plot.<br /><br />With Sirius Black on the Castle Grounds and the Ghostly Dementors (Azkabans ruthless guards) searching for him, the castle is locked down for the safety of the students.  The movie introduces us to Professor Lupin as the new instructor of Defense agains the Black Arts.  He has a particular interest in Harry and it's quickly apparent that Lupin is a red herring.  Once Black is found, though, all is not what it seems....<br /><br />As mentioned, this movie is very different than the first two.  We see very little of Harry, Ron, and Hermione attending classes and learning their studies.  That all takes a backseat to the main plot.  Also, the characters of Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall are reduced to VERY minor roles although Professor Snape and Hagrid still get a fair amount of screen time.  In addition,  Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton)is reduced from an arrogant bully, to an arrogant bully who spends most of the movie as a sniveling coward and gets punched out by Hermione.  Gary Oldman plays the role of Sirius Black and although his role is relatively small, he's effective as the murderous Black in his typical over-the-top style.<br /><br />Another departure from the previous films is that much of the action takes place out-of-doors rather than in the mysterious walls of Hogwarts.  Some may be put off by that since the magic and mystery of Hogwart's castle is a strong drawing point but I found it quite refreshing to get the fish out of water a little bit.<br /><br />Having never read the book I can't comment on how closely the film followed the story but I for one enjoyed the movie quite a bit.  I think it allowed the main characters of Harry and Hermione to branch out a bit more and show a broader range of emotions and abilities.  Harry even comes off a bit frightening when his anger causes him to put a rather horrible spell on Aunt Marge and then refuse to reverse it.<br /><br />A Good effort by new director Cuaron.'s effective as the murderous Black in his typical over-the-top style. <br /> <br />Another departure from the previous films is that much of the action takes place out-of-doors rather than in the mysterious walls of Hogwarts.

0767834739|4.0|First of All, I've never played any of the games except the first one, and that kicked my ass... I am one of those weak little players that gravitates toward RPG or tetris games... &lt;so sad...>. <br />I've heard that the movie was better for people who haven't played the games, and must agree. I was told more about the storyline (What, I'm not telling you- What, are you too lazy to play the game?!) and it was quite different with other characters and whatnot.  <br />Overall the visuals were decent and it \\"didn't get boring\\" at all. The only thing I didn't like was the final fight scene where the cameras were switching back and forth and it was a bit disorienting. <br />Nemesis was wonderfully portrayed but should of had a bigger part. His rocket launcher was also very entertaining... <br />My opinion? Go buy it. If nothing else, you WILL be entertained by the black guy's witty humor.
B00005JN0T|3.0|This was an impressive film.  Not from the standpoint that it was a great story or with great actors, it was the quickness of the plot that impressed me.  I don't normally say this, but the fact that I. Robot moved exactly to the points that needed to be moved without any misleading, poor back story, or cheesy Will Smith moments impressed me.  Director Alex Proyas knew exactly how to manage the excessively huge budget and make sure that we, the audience, were getting the biggest bang for our buck.  Yes, there were downfalls to this film, but somehow I could overlook them.  I will be the first to admit that this was not my favorite type of film.  The huge CGI scenes, the grossly overpaid actors, and the disrespect to one of Asimov's infamous books by the same title will really churn your stomach (as it did mine), but unlike the rest of these types of film, I, Robot did something different.  It kept the eye candy going throughout the film and really never let your eyes rest.  This very imaginative world, almost a fantasy world, had something to keep your eyes busy the entire time, and I loved it.  Whether it would be Will Smith's semi-plastic looking Audi, or the Sony created \\"Sonny\\" robots infiltrating the city, your eyes will definitely walk away from this film with bulging bellies and a desire for more.<br /><br />Outside of the visually pleasing aspect of this film, you really don't have much to enjoy.  Will Smith's performance is mediocre at best.  He tries to do his best throughout the film, but after his introductory shower scene that was completely unnecessary it is only continually going downhill.  He tries to play the bad boy style that he patented in such film like Bad Boys to this project, what ultimately fails is his ability to handle the discrimination towards the robots.  I never really felt as if he actually disliked them, no matter what the sub-story claimed it just never felt real.  I think what ignited this feeling was Chi McBride's role.  Don't get me wrong, he is a decent actor, but he was trying to bring his role from Boston Public to this part.  He was trying too hard to be the hard-nosed Lieutenant that constantly fought with Spooner, but instead it just came across as Chi being Chi.  There wasn't anything exciting about him in the least bit.  Looking deeper into all the characters, this is what I felt was a major flaw with this film.  The actors really gave nothing spectacular to their roles.  They were minimally developed and several of them seemed like Swiss cheese.  It felt like wasted talent in this film.  Proyas knows better.  He knows how to get great performances from his people; I don't know what pulled him from his norm in this project.  Cromwell, Greenwood, and even Bridget Moynahan were just hitting that average line.  This was yet another glowing example of what happens when money is spent on CGI instead of highly trained actors.<br /><br />So, it looks like we have a superbly visual film coupled with horrible, below the line acting.  What did you expect?  This was your average action film with superior CGI.  I mentioned before on how the visual work is what really kept my eyes glued to the screen, but there was one other element that just rattled my mind.  In an attempt not to give the ending away, I will say this much.  It is not happy.  I do not think that upon viewing the ending of this film you have this sense of joy and comfort knowing that everything is going to be hunky-dory.  It is as if you are viewing the beginning chapter to a much bigger story, and that was interesting to me.  Proyas is notoriously known for his subtle dark endings that keep you on the brink of wonder (see Dark City), and I, Robot was no exception.  It was a brief moment of excitement to see this ending, after a brutal battle sequence where your mind could literally fall asleep because you already know the results, you have this mind-bending ending that really creeped me out.  Perhaps I read the ending wrong, butI wasn't at ease when the credits rolled.  I snickered because I thought of what could be coming, but definitely not a jump-up-and-down with glee sort of moment.  It was strange, but beautifully Proyas.<br /><br />Overall, this was a decent film.  I think I would reference this film similar to the way that I felt about the actors, it was just barely hitting the average line.  This was better than I expected (which isn't saying much since I was expecting it to be a dud) with really amazing visuals, but you cannot stand on those alone.  For this film to really have succeeded, you would have needed to counter balance the CGI with a better story (more details about the laws and more development with Cromwell's character) and much better acting.  I see why the producers went with Smith because he is bankable, but he just didn't bring the human element to the table like it was needed.  I couldn't see his hatred enough to really bring about his emotional change.  I needed more, but found less.  Decent, but nothing that will touch my DVD player again.<br /><br />Grade: *** out of *****but I wasn't at ease when the credits rolled.

B00005JNBQ|4.0|Napoleon Dynamite. You'll either love it or hate it. Me? I loved it. To me it was just a sweet, funny movie about a nerd who really didn't care that he was nerd. After all, he had skills! I think many people will be able to relate to the nerds vs. the popular kids theme (I mean, didn't your school have a Summer Wheatley?) and Napoleon's sense of not really caring made this a real 'feel-good' movie. So many scenes reminded me of my school years--tetherball on the playground, slow dancing in the gym, tator tots in the cafeteria. Great lines too! I find myself saying \\"Yessssss\\" far too often now, but what a fun movie find! Make sure you listen to the commentary on the special features. Oh yeah, I let my eight year old son watch this and he loved it too. Definitely a safe movie for families to watch together...if you like that kind of humor!
0780622650|4.0|There's not much here that will rival Arthur C. Clarke's best work or change the face of modern science fiction - and that's how it should be. This is Lost In Space. That means the Robinson family and a really cool robot facing all kinds of weird monsters and fun adventures in space. I never missed an episode of the classic tv show and I enjoyed this remake too. It's a modern take on a childhood favorite and it works on that level. I loved this movie.

4789009637|5.0|For those of you who didn't have the chance to browse from a selection of Japanese language book, let me recommend this textbook to you. <br />There is a total of 24 lessons in Genki I & II. Genki I consist of 12 lessons. <br />Here's the sequence to which the lessons are structured <br /> <br />1. Dialogue <br /> <br />2. English translated dialogue <br /> <br />3. Vocabulary <br /> <br />4. Grammar <br /> <br />5. Practice <br /> <br /> <br />What I've found best about this textbook compared to other japanese textbook is in the organization. I sometimes stare at \\"Japanese for Busy People II\\" and get overwhelmed by the difficulty and the globs of unspaced words. It in turn become very discouraging to continue reading because it is not the vocabulary or the grammar that you'd be focusing on, it's finding what's important in that glob of paragraph that takes away your concentration. <br /> <br />Grammar: <br />(average of 6 grammar per lesson) <br /> <br />In \\"An Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese\\", important grammars are bolded, spaced, and highlighted. The explaination in how to use the grammar are precise and neatly spaced along with an example or two to illustrate how to use it. <br /> <br />Vocabulary: <br />(Average of 50 words per lesson) <br /> <br />The vocabularies they teach in this textbook are basically the same as the ones in other textbooks. Useful in everyday conversation. But again I must stress that this textbook organized very efficiently. <br /> <br />1. Noun <br />2. i-adjective <br />3. na-adjective <br />4. u-verb <br />5. ru-verb <br />6. adverbs <br /> <br />For a beginner, you might not know the reason to distinguish between i-adj and na-adj. But it becomes very useful when you start studying grammar. Some textbooks out there also distinguishes the types of verb and adjectives, but some doesn't. <br /> <br />Practices: <br />(6-7 pages per lesson) <br /> <br />The practices in this textbook uses both pictures and words to test your recall ability. From the looks of the practices in all the japanese textbooks, they are not designed to be a self-study course. There is no accompanying answer-key along with the practices. I agree that the practice is designed so that you can figure it out by rereading the lesson, but personally, it bothers me because you cannot be sure at that moment whether your answer is correct or incorrect. In a way, it prevents me from putting it into my long term memory because my answers might be wrong. I'm sure my opinion can be argued. <br /> <br />Lastly, there is also a Genki Workbook (sold separately). Each lesson has around 8 pages of extra sheets to practice. Again, it has no answer key. The last page in every lesson is a listening assignment. Which means unless you have the CD (not provided within workbook), you cannot do that assignment. But it's still good if you want the extra 7 pages/lesson of practice in writing. <br /> <br />A little story to end this review <br /> <br />A boy went into a language bookstore and asks the store owner which japanese textbook is the best. The store owner replied: \\"Genki\\" - The End <br /> <br />I know, it's an awesome story.

But it's worth noting that \\"Hero\\" is an unique film in itself, in that it's the first such film released in the U.S. who dares to carry a political message. <br /> <br />Boasting an all star cast of Tony Leung Chiu Wai, Maggie Cheung, Zhang Ziyi and Jet Li*, director Zhang Yimou (\\"Raising the Red Lantern\\", \\"The Road Home\\") undertakes the project of making a multi-million dollar martial arts fantasy film for the first time in his career.  It becomes apparent during the film that Zhang is not only concerned with the choreographic beauty of martial arts action, but also wanted to make a film that superimposes several elements of cinematic aesthetics.  He notably takes inspiration from several other works.  The action sequences are no doubt similar to that in \\"Crouching Tiger\\".  The use of different colors corresponding with different scenes in the film, in the effort to convey certain moods, is an obvious tribute to Akira Kurosawa's \\"Rashomon\\": There's a scene where the two leading female characters duel in red silk robes in a forest, as they fight, all the leaves falling from the trees and on the ground begin to turn red.  One could even say that some of the grand scale fighting scenes and computer generated graphics are Zhang's response to American productions like \\"Lord of the Ring\\" and \\"The Matrix\\". <br /> <br />The movie's story is somewhat superficial in its execution, but manages to stay on target with the message of how we define a hero.  In the film, Jet Li's character ultimately sacrifices his personal aims for the greater good --- the unity of the Chinese nation.  I have to give Zhang credit for daring to inject into his film a political message that's not easily accessible to everyone, especially the American audience.  In the end, I nonetheless found the film to be visually stunning, as it makes very good use of China's beautiful natural landscapes, combined with richly colored photography. <br /> <br />Where the film falls short is on the overall strengh of the cast's acting.  But this is partly the director's doing.  Zhang never bothered to delved too deep into his characters, and preferred to have them do the talking by moving gracefully or sitting silently in beautiful color-matching robes most of the time.  The acting, when there is any, tends to be overly melodramatic, and even pretentious at times.  The film is also a bit inauthentic in its obvious nods to \\"Crouching Tiger\\": Some of the action sequences and techniques are too similar.  And also the music, because Zhang had actually gone as far as hiring the same composer from \\"Crouching Tiger\\" to compose the music for \\"Hero\\", and this fellow ended up giving us almost a duplicate score. <br /> <br />Aside from its lack of authenticiy in certain areas, done so mainly to please the identified tastes of a foreign audience, \\"Hero\\" remains an interesting piece of work by director Zhang, both visually and plot wise.  For a contrast in plot and character studies, check out his new martial arts fantasy release, \\"House of Flying Daggers\\" (also starring Zhang Ziyi), due out in the U.S. in December 2004.  <br /> <br />X.J. Zhou <br /> <br />* Wai and Cheung can be found in \\"In the Mood for Love\\" directed by Wong Kar Wai, Zhang Ziyi is of no relation to Zhang Yimou, but both had also worked together in \\"The Road Home\\", whereas Jet Li is a man who needs no introduction.

B0002XDODU|5.0|this album is like all rammstein albums IT RULES. its not their best but i still highly recommend you pick one up. the theme of this album is travel as the title implies. my favorite track on here is either mein teil or moskau.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|\\"Elf\\" will likely become a perennial Christmas favorite - expect to see it on TV annually beginning next year.  But it deserves that future-classic status, because it is a sweet and often very funny Christmas film.  Will Ferrell is perfectly fey and naive as Buddy, the full-sized human raised as an elf at Santa's North Pole.  Never quite fitting in the elf-world, he discovers he has a birth father in the \\"real\\" world, and embarks on a journey to find and bond with him.  His guileless misadventures in real-world New York are amusing and sometimes touching.  The supporting cast is first-rate: James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Zooey Duschamel... and I especially got a kick out of Bob Newhart as Buddy's adoptive father, Ed Asner as Santa, and Leon Redbone as a Burl-Ivesish snowman.  Jon Favreau directs it with style and humor, with the obligatory Christmas sentimentality that never veers into mawkishness.  This is a great film for all ages.
B000660UN0|5.0|I absolutely love Clapton, but I was still very disappointed and unsatisfied with his studio album of RJ covers.  Despite the fact that the musicianship was superb, it just felt way too sterile and bland.  I think \\"Sessions for Robert J.\\" more than makes up for that.  They should have shelved \\"Me and Mr. J.\\" and released only this album, as it blows \\"Me and Mr. J.\\" away.  You get the same superb musicianship with added energy and passion that just seems to be missing from this album's studio counterpart, plus you get some superb smoking Clapton solo accoustic work which blows me away everytime I watch it on the DVD.  It's one thing to listen to Clapton and admire him, but it's really quite amazing when you watch him make it all look so easy.  I was never a huge Clapton fan until I had a chance to see him live, and I was sold after his first solo.  The CD/DVD combo is something artists should do more of.  You can put the DVD on at home be mesmerized, and you've also got a CD to take with you in the car.  \\"Me and Mr. J.\\" isn't bad, but if you have to chose, this one wins hands down.  All Clapton fans should love it, and I can't imagine a \\"purist\\" blues fan not being able to find something that he or she likes on it either.
0679428895|3.0|\\"Pompeii\\"  ends with a bang: the Vesuvius eruption of 79AD, which buries the town and wipes out most of the characters.  A good guy -- a waterwords engineer -- and a bad guy -- a real estate developer -- struggle, but the reader can't help thinking that what they do doesn't matter because they will all be dead in two days anyway.  While I enjoyed \\"Pompeii\\" as holiday reading, I found it less of a page turner than other books by Robert Harris, such as \\"Fatherland\\" and \\"Enigma.\\" Both were about people confronting the human-made disaster of nazism with their wits, and with the ability to affect the outcome by their actions.<br />\\"Pompeii\\" also dwells too much for my taste on the dark side of Roman society.  Yes, they had slavery and masters who abused  slaves, but  so did every other contemporary society, and so did the US until the Civil War.  Of the many characters we meet, only a handful  have any integrity. All the others are hustlers or corrupt officials. If 1st -century  Rome truly had been this rotten, it  is hard to imagine how it could have achieved what  we still marvel at  2000 years later.<br />The \\"Disappointed\\" reader who reviewed the book on 12/1/2003 is mistaken to assume that the hero's rejection of  religious beliefs is anachronistic.  Writing \\"De Natura Deorum\\" more than 100 years before, Cicero states that there are philosophers who don't believe the pagan gods exist.  He himself makes no strong statement of  faith, but, like Thomas Jefferson with respect to Christianity, he believes that the disappearance of piety  towards the gods will entail the disappearance of loyalty and social union.  In other words, whether the gods exist or not, it's good for the people to worship them.
B00005JN0T|5.0|WELL, I ALMOST LET THIS ONE JUST PASS ME BY, AFTER READING SO MANY NEGATIVE COMMENTS FROM MY FELLOW AMAZON.COM WRITERS, BUT BOY AM I GLAD I DIDN'T! WILL SMITH AS ALWAYS SPARKLES IN HIS LEAD ROLE, TAKING SERIOUSLY WHAT IS TRANSPIRING BEFORE HIM. HE IS STILL OUR ULTIMATE HERO HERE, AS IN HIS OTHER WORKS IN FILMS. THIS INCREDIBLY EXCITING FILM WAS TRULY A REAL BLAST FROM START TO EXCITING CLIMAX. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE TOTALLY AWESOME, AND THIS DIGITAL TRANSFER, FROM 20TH CENTURY FOX REALLY EXCELS ON MANY LEVELS. THE PICTURE QUALITY IS TOP NOTCH PRISTINE, AND THE USE OF THE DTS AUDIO WILL TRULY SHAKE ANY ROOM IN YOUR HOME, WHEREVER IT IS SET UP! WOW, WHAT A DVD, AND WHAT A GREAT SUMMER FLICK THAT HAS TRANSPIRED INTO ONE OF THE YEAR'S END TOP MUST OWN DVDS. WILL, KEEP ON TRUCKIN, GUY YOU DEFINITELY RULE, AS DOES \\"I, ROBOT\\". IT'S A KEEPER FOR SURE.
B00065JTBA|4.0|I have been a fan of Bon Jovi since about 1988 (I was 8 at the time), but I must admit that I lost faith in the band after the exellent Keep The Faith. Not that their albums have been bad since then. But they have only contained a small amount of the great songs that we all know that they can write. It's not because I'm against bands growing. <br /> <br />I got the box set as a Christmas present ( I am a fan after all), and it totally suprised me. These songs are great!! There are of course non of the big hit songs like Living On A Prayer and Wanted Dead or Alive, but still great songs. This box set made believe in Bon Jovi again and actually fall in love all over again with the band. the only thing that bugs me now is the fact that they left some of these great songs of their weaker albums. But hey, Jon wanted to leave of Living On A Prayer on Slippery when Wet.  <br />
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This CD is amazing.  I enjoyed the first CD.  This CD, however, blew me away.  I could relate to so many of the songs.  I especially like number 7 (nobody's home), because I could relate to it in my own way, just as I could number 8 (have you forgotten).  If you didn't like Avril's first CD, I would recommend buying this CD and giving her another shot.  I think we see the true Avril come out in this CD, not the Avril that the producers wanted to promote on the first.
B000646MNE|5.0|I love this series.  I saw a couple of episodes out of order and had a little bit of a hard time watching, but when I started renting the series and watching, I couldn't stop until the whole show was over.  The thing that confuses me about this box set, however, is the fact that if you buy each season separately you save over fifty dollars.  Can someone enlighten me as to why it is more expensive to buy the box set?  Thanks
B000001FKY|5.0|I remember being a young boy wathing MTV in the late 80's. Back the they actually played music. Anyway I saw Pour Some Sugar On Me, and was stunned. I begged my uncle, who owned Hysteria  to make me a copy. Since then I have bought everything Def Leppard has released. first on tape then on CD. It's almost 10 years ago and I still consider Hysteria their best album and one of greatest albums ever released. <br /> <br />There are a lot of reasons why this album is so great. First of all the songs. This album produced 7 hit singles. I dare you, try to find that many hits on a single Britney Spears album. I don't think you can. It may not be clever or intelligent song writing, but the songs are very cathcy. The album was released in 1987, but the album has stood the test of time. The singles are stil playing on the radio. when you hear Pour some sugar on me, love bites or Animal you can't hear that it is songs from the 80's. Eventhough, they are typical 80's song, they dosen't sound like everything else from that period of time. And that is best thing about this record. I guess, that this is mostly due to Mutt Lange, the producer. Last but not least the band them selves gives their best performances ever. <br /> <br />So there you go. Sadly Def Leppard has not made a truly great album since then, apart from the underrated Slang album, but I haven't lost faith in them.
B000089CJI|1.0|Well a couple turnoffs include the sickeningly dull, totally non-poetic lyrics and weak, emoish singing style. No not beautiful so much as realllllllllly sappy. A couple of the melodies are kinda memorable but in an annoying way. And come on people, can we maybe  stop with the \\"anybody who loves music\\" will like this s%@*. I happen to LOVE music but not this. It's also insulting to bands like the Shins or New Order to be compared to this. For cool \\"warm\\" electronic check out Plaid's \\"Not for threes\\" or for cool catchy music try the Shins, the Strokes, the Pixies, Spoon, early Cure, the Smiths among countless others . Don't get duped into wasting money on one of the most overrated/hyped products around.
B0002X314C|5.0|As a lover of SOUL music (nothing \\"neo\\" under the sun), I was getting tired of these wannabe deep artists, then John Legend came along. I am upset because all Circuit City, Best Buy, Target and Walmart stores in Raleigh and Winston-Salem, NC have been sold out since this album's release date; I haven't been able to purchase it (and I called myself trying to beat the rush by going on my lunch break)! I have, however, listened to my cousin's copy (and unsuccessfully tried to steal it) and I purchased \\"Live From the Knitting Factory\\" from his website. \\"Refuge\\" makes me cry. It is in competition with \\"Overjoyed\\" to be my favorite song of all time. Thank you John for creating good music! THANK YOU!
B0001KL5DA|5.0|The second season of six feet under really starts to go more in depth with each character and you start to know who they truly are. It has much more twists and turns and is very addicting. I didn't start watching the show until recently on DVD and I am hooked, I would watch up to 4 hrs. a day. I can't wait till they release season 3&4 so I can watch it in time for season 5. It is a must see show and anyone can relate to at least one or more characters. It is the best show ever. You have to see it!
B000000OAN|5.0|This album is simply amazing. Freddie Mercury's vocals sound incredible on every song. This album defiitely showcases the band's versatility, they can do everything from the operatic \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" and \\"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\\" to more metal-y songs like \\"Sweet Lady\\". There isn't a song on the CD I don't like. A must-have for lovers of all musical genres; there is something for everyone on this album. Five and a half stars! <br />-Bohema
B0002EQ7EC|5.0|Rhythm of the Saints is one of the best albums I own. As well as being one of the most richly layered sounding albums I've ever heard, it has incredible songwriting.    To create the lush sound of the album, Simon brought together an amazing group of musicians for this album. The South African guitarist is particularly wonderful. He makes the guitar sound like a different instrument.    But what I think defines this album is the drumming. I have heard that Simon went to Brazil and recorded live drumming, then created his songs around it. Thus Simon's songwriting is very different from his earlier, more linear style.  The lyrics are like snapshots; quick impressions strung together.      I am a huge fan of almost all Paul Simon (in fact, I own almost verything he's ever recorded, including S&G), but I truly enjoy the more experimental songwriting in Rhythm of the Saints. It can still gives me chills at certain moments.     Rhythm of the Saints is at the top of my desert island album list. I recommend it highly.
0790730960|5.0|I am a really big fan of the Femme Fatal! Michelle P. does a great job, she plays that passive, stressed out career woman perfectly. She stunned me with her preformance as that creepy, domanering Catwoman. <br /> <br />My bff loves the penguine, so this is the purr-fect flick for both of us!!!
0553582445|5.0|Robin Hobb's first trilogy about the Farseers is one of my all-time favorite series of books.  The story of Fitz continues in this trilogy as he is pulled back from his secluded retirement to once again be the catalyst around which the next generation's events turn.   <br />The beginning of the book was slow (but then again, so is Fitz's life when we look back in upon him) but the intrigue picked up and I lost sleep finishing it quickly.  Just about all the characters are seen in a new light, and it was fun to see Fitz move from the role of student to mentor.  Hobb has followed up with a worthy sequel. <br /> <br />These two trilogies are very reminiscent in style of Melanie Rawn's two trilogies that also follow two generations in her world.  I love the (central) idea of the Witted and Old Blood.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I don't usually write a review because most of the time, there are enough submitted reviews that cover a movie thoroughly, and the averaged number of stars give you a pretty good indication of how good a movie is. <br /> <br />Napoleon Dynamite is truly an enigma.  You've got people praising the movie with the highest rating, and at the other extreme, people calling the movie the worst movie ever made.  I happen to belong to the latter category.  I only watched the first 15 minutes of the movie, and then gave up waiting for something to happen.  The \\"movie\\" was plot-less, the characters flat and dimension-less.  It was like sitting in front of a wall and watching fresh paint dry.  Scenes ended with nothing happening, dialog rolling from the most boring of characters. <br /> <br />I usually look for an Amazon review average of 4 or greater, reasoning that a movie that gets a low vote of 2 and a vote of 5 averages 3.5, which just glancing at the summary vote looks like a pretty good movie, but might be a real dog. <br /> <br />Napoleon Dynamite at an average rating of 4.5 stars with 300 submittals is a mystery to me.
0767834739|2.0|Mostly everyone knows that rarely does a sequel live up to the expectations that its previous installment set up for it. Don't get me wrong there have been quite a few sequels/trilogies that have created legacies for themselves,..the Resident Evil series on the other hand seems to be moving towards disaster. The first installment of the series, Resident Evil, was excellent in my opinion, the story was told in a manner that left you yearning for more and kept you somewhat in suspense. Resident Evil also left you with a cliffhanger wondering what's going to happen next, thus wanting to see the sequel, Resident Evil: Apocalypse. I actually waited a few days after viewing the first Resident Evil to see RE: Apocalypse because I thought the first one was done so well that it will be better if I wait to view the second film. So I watched it and honestly can say that I have no reaction, the was absolutely no plot and if you can try to point one out it is probably a very silly one. It seems as if the writers just wanted to push another installment out so they can get to the next one and create a collectors edition box set. Milla defiantely was not aas appealing in the second film as she was in the first Resident Evil. I don't know but a very attractive woman who seems innocent at first then kicks arse later on in the movie is very sexy. In Apocalypse you already know that Milla kicks [...] so theres no suprise and she looks a little brutish while doing so. Kinda turned me off, The character Jill Valentine was very appealing but I feel she got robbed of a decent portrayal, I was confused throughout the movie as to who she was as there was a very brief intro to her. Overall the film was trying to hard to outdo its previous and failed miserably. There was too much focus and shooting 'em up and not enough story or plot. So a comment to the director/producers, in the next film remember that maybe fans watching the Resident Evil films actually enjoy a good plot and are not mindless like the zombies wandering within the film.
B00006879E|1.0|yet another boring pop/rock band that is pushed forward by media hype, this simply does not mean that it is good music in anyway shape or form,i know good music when i hear it and i've been listening to music for many years now(old & new). Simply put is that pop/rock music is not the same as its used to be, now we have overhyped rubbish such as this band making overrated annoying music that people sadly buy and \\"think\\" it is good music, listen to older pop/rock music and then you'll see what i mean when modern pop/rock bands in today's world suck. It also sucks when bands with actual tallent such as \\"creed\\" break up and we still have these other rubbish music in the airwaves, people who buy this type of music are only fooling themselves and that truly is sad.
B000268QB2|5.0|I've read a number of other reviews for Keane; seen some good, seen some bad.  So, at best, I can try to get my point across.  Sure, it's just my opinion, and everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but to pass up this album, in my view, would be a mistake. <br /> <br />Back when Travis and Coldplay were playing heavily on the radio, there was hype behind the tenderness they evoked in their songs; the longing chords drawing in the listener to sit back and think about the words, to think about why the song was written and what it was behind the choices they made in their songs.  The similarity stops there with Keane.  Sure, they present the tender, longing songs of the broken-hearted or the focused tension of a dismissed love, but they are, themselves, their own band. <br /> <br />\\"Hopes and Fears\\" opens with one of the albums more 'edgier' songs, \\"Somewhere Only We know\\".  I happened to have heard the song while test-playing albums at a local music-seller, and it stuck with me throughout the day.  And just when my mind was drifting away from the lyrics I could remember, I'd hear the song again...and again.  All in all, I heard the song being played in the mall, outside of a Best Buy and on the radio, all within a five hour time period.  So, that is when I picked up the album.   <br /> <br />\\"This is the Last Time\\" is softer, displaying the vocals of Tom chaplin in an arrangement of catchy melody, touched with the longiness of each verse.  \\"Bend and Break\\" follows after; definately one of the catchier songs on the album, and definately one of my favorites.  We drop down in mood a bit with \\"We Might as Well Be Strangers\\", and the even moodier \\"Everybody's Changing\\".   <br /> <br />Without the guitars, the sound is smoother, more delicate, yet each song is carried by the collective melodies of piano, drums and vocals.  And when you get to \\"She Has No time\\" and \\"Sunshine\\", you just want to drift away into the world of Keane. <br /> <br />Keane is a group which I playheavily on my way to and from work, at work, at home...Altogether, one of the top albums of 2004 in my opinion.  So, before you let the negative reviews affect you, spend those few bucks to pick up this album, and I can promise you that you'll be surprised at how much each song can grow on you.
B00005A0N5|5.0|Oceanborn is so difficult to describe to another person. I can say how beautiful the lyrics are, how fantastic the theme is and how passionate the vocals are, but you have to listen to it yourself to experience its magick. <br /> <br />I usually shy away from bands, whose lead vocalist doesn't write the lyrics, but Tarja (mezzo soprano-lead singer) performs Tuomas Holopainen's creations perfectly, and it is clear that he trusts her enough to do this. <br />Personally, Oceanborn is my favourite of all the Nightwish albums. A previous review was stating what little power Nightwish have or something to do with having a female vocalist makes them weak, however in my opinion Oceanborn is one of the most powerful albums I've heard, if you consider the passion and the beauty within its formation, shared by the whole band. <br /> <br />As I wrote earlier Oceanborn's hard to describe, especially when picking out the highlights of the album as, again IMO the whole album flows beautifully from beginning to end. What prompted me to buy this CD in the first place though was the brilliant cover version of 'Walking in the air' from the theme of 'the Snowman' (1 of the more mellow tracks). And when I first got this album I straightaway took a likening to the 'Passion and the Opera' and 'Devil and the Deep Dark Ocean'. The album art is wonderful too and superbly suited to the music. <br /> <br />This album provides escapism for anyone tired of this cruel and mundane world. <br /> <br />
B00004Z4SD|5.0|I recently bought this movie and I am glad I did. A big fan of David Lynch, I now have almost all of his films (except Eraserhead, Dune, and the irritaingly non-existant Twin Peaks 2nd season box set). Upon watching this film, what struck me was the breath-taking beauty of the combination of cinematography and score. Watching the gentle passing over golden rows of corn and hauntingly empty main streets with the excellent orchestration of Angelo Badalementi will warm anyone's heart. The story of a dying old man making a final trip of reconcilliation with himself and with his brother is not something you'd expect to see from hollywood these days. Funny how a movie like this could be made by a director who is used to delving into the dark parts of the human psyche. <br />As I said, the camerawork, score, story, and characters are top-notch. However, there is one complaint I have with this film. I'm not familiar with Alvin Straight the man, but I felt that at times the film portrayed him as some sort of saint, dispensing wisdom to everyone he comes across. Maybe in talking to others, Straight was in a way talking to himself... <br />I highly recommend The Straight Story to anyone who wants a real family film, a film with not only a good message but a film that is a great work of art. <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Tenderness can be just as abstract as insanity.\\" - David Lynch
0393317552|4.0|Find out when you read this book! <br /> <br />Diamond lengthy and detailed book is fascinating, suggesting answers for many of the serious questions about why world societies are the way they are. <br /> <br />Having completed it, I now realise that it is only the starting point for a much closer examination of all sorts of inequalities prevalent today. As a result, I've been drawn to reading accounts of globalism, politics and sociology which I would never have considered prior to this book.  <br /> <br />Definitely worth a read although I would caution the casual reader as Diamond's commitment to thoroughness and the sheer scope of his subject does mean that the book can be hard going at times.  <br /> <br />My only disappointment is that Diamond does not go on to consider lessons we can learn from his review of our history for present and future developments of society.
B0002XVQNU|4.0|This movie was made by Colin Farrell's performance as Bullseye.  I absolutely hated Ben Affleck as DD.  The movie did have much more edge and grit than the original theatrical and DVD release.  It really deserves to be seen as a director's cut, not a glossy PG-13 version.
B00003CXA3|5.0|I just saw this one the other day for the second time and was amazed at how riveting it still is.  It's also one of the only times that I can think of where a car chase scene rises to the level of art.  There is practically nothing in this movie that is black and white.  Even after all these years of cultural and social decline, Hackman's final words to Roy Scheider still manage to disturb.  I was further surprised at how pertinent the themes are and at the unpredictability of the plot turns.  The acting is first rate with the French actors being well chosen.
B00005JMYI|5.0|This is one of the best comedies to come out in the past year.  If you liked Old School you will love this movie.  Will Ferell stars in this movie as Ron Burgandy, who is the local news anchor in San Diego.  The setting for this movie is the 1970's when not many women had important jobs (at least in the movie).  The main point of this movie revolves around a women who falls in love with Ferell and then when he does not show up for work one day, does the nightly news.  This devestates Ferell and everything in his life just goes down from there.   <br /> <br />This movie is appropriate for almost anyone as long as they can handle certain swearing.  There is only 1 part of the movie where there are bad words and it lasts for only about 15 seconds.  There are many funny parts to this movie, and the characters are played to extreme.   <br /> <br />I would recomment this movie to anyone who needs cheering up or has liked any of Wil Ferrell's past movies.   <br /> <br />Overall rating: 5 stars out of 5
B00005U8EM|5.0|No way you still haven't seen this movie. A great concept and really funny. The first time I saw this movie I woke up my parents a couple of times from my laughter (the tv was showing it at 1 am!!) Great great movie and you cannot but really love Bill Marey, the guy is funny...
B0002X314C|5.0|With so much hype about \\"crossing over\\" and being as \\"crunk\\" as possible, it's nice to see someone release an honest-to-goodness R&B album.  Yeah there are songs that liven things up a bit, but the slow ballads and serene piano melodies really take center stage.  \\"She Don't Have To Know\\" is a nice highlight track, and \\"Ordinary People\\" shows his vocal dexterity (complete with what sounds like a REAL PIANO).  \\"Live It Up\\" has a smooth bass line that sets your soul at ease, while the lead single has been topping charts for the past 2 months or so.  (If you don't know the title of this song it's time to come out of that bomb shelter and join the rest of the world...Y2K has come and gone). <br /> <br />If you're a fan of true R&B, and long for the days where missing the forward and back buttons on your CD player didn't matter, then this CD is for you.
B0001906O0|5.0|So U LOVE the Cure, and tired of carrying all the CD's back and forth to your car?  there is an answer, and here it is.  This outstanding compilation of The Cure's greatest hits, some newer remixes, and the hard to find B-Sides.  I have been a cure fan since there \\"CD Pornography\\" was released, I have consistantly collected over 100 12\\" remixes from the USA as well as from overseas with the B-sides, being JUST as important as Side A (the current single).  When My best friend passed away, he left everything music related to me.  He was stationed in Germany in the US Army and, we together as a team, when he moved back to the states were unstoppable.  I was so happy to see these B-sides finally released.  \\"Snow in Summer\\" and \\"Sugar Girl\\" are just 2 of my favorites that bring my memories back to full life of my friend Don, and I now have all my favorites on one brilliant CD compilation.  The booklet enclosed is stunning, the photo's and commentary is brillant.  The pure essence of the cure is visible in your heart and in your soul.  You are a cure fan If you can really \\"FEEL\\" what Robert is singing about like the pain, or pleasure and sometimes just do not really know where or what is is singing about, yet is somehow touches you, Yes Robert Smith may seem a bit strange, but if you look back at history most of the great artists are a bit strange, from Picasso to Jim Morrison, they all are great talents, and mixed in the pot is \\"The Cure\\"  Listening to this CD I remember, to precise detail, where I was or, what I was wearing when I first....heard that song, over and over the memories fill the spaces that were empty, some memories are great and, some sad yet, they are still there, on my B-side  Serious fan's really should look into this CD is is a portrait of art.  Don This is for YOU! love always my friend.   Jason Prof. DJ
B0002234LS|2.0|I'll willingly watch pretty much anything with Johnny Depp in it. He's in fine form in this one, portraying a floundering, misdirected writer who is confronted by a mysterious and violent stranger, \\"Shooter,\\" [Torturro] accusing him of plagiarism. But even Depp's facial tics, quirky mannerisms, and off-beat portrayal can't save this movie, because I figured out the plot in about 15 minutes and spent the remaining 81 minutes waiting for the inevitable conclusion. This film ventures into the realms of Angel Heart and Mulholland Dr., but can't really win either way, and the cinematic clichs about the hermetic, weirdo writer who can't separate fiction from reality are way too familiar and way too stale. We've seen all of this before, and we've seen it done better.
B0000AM6LY|5.0|Simply Red have been a favorite of mine since the \\"holding back the years and $$$ 2 tight 2 mention days\\" from eons ago.  they kinda slipped a bit after the debut CD.  But held a somewhat tight knit of fans.  This past year with the release of \\"HOME\\" they have a pure gold mine of tracks that can easily be turned into \\"gold\\" as a remixed CD maxi or unreleased club mixes (4 tracks released to date and remixed buy so many BIG name remixers)it is \\"SIMPLY\\" amazing.  For so many years, even Back to the \\"Kon Kan\\" days of I beg your Pardon, there have been remixers that are not straight.  Not alot of people realize that, and it is a part of our society, that even being straight, you have to admit we could not live with out music.  It was always so UN COOL to admit that you were not straight, yet in 2004 and 2005 now, it seems the IN thing to do from Movies, to TV, to Music.  It all is a BIG influence on our daily life.  I am not trying to OUT anyone, but the next time you hear a song that you LOVE, and you go and buy it from Madonna to Britney, to Pet Shop Boys, ETC....to just about 75% of the remixes you hear are not straight you eventually HAVE 2 HAVE that song for your own, think about it??? And YOU know who is able to fix your \\"bad hair day\\" (your hairdresser, NOT that he is Gay, but maybe your waiter at Dinner is.)  This world should NOT discriminate, and this is a MUST CD for all Simply Red fans.  This by Far shows so much emotion and maturity from 20 years ago, the lyrics and club remixes are superb, and add new light to a Man who \\"Simply\\" loves to do what he is doing, and that shows determination, in a world where it tends not to be found all that often.  I give this CD 5 stars, just for being here in 2005 when so many one hit wonders are \\"just that\\" keep it up Mick (Lead Singer) you are great, hope this review is of help in your decision process, believe me it is \\"SIMPLY\\" worth it Thanks  <br />Jason @Jason33305@aol.com
B0002XH9Z4|3.0|every new release that has been coming out so far has just been reruns.  except for the dvd, the package isnt worth the money.  i would like to have live recorded versions of these songs from concerts that would be a fresh approach and i would but this if that wsa the case. much better than to have the same songs over and over again.  this is why i returned the number ones collection.  there isnt anything here thats worth while.  if anything, people will probably just find the unreleased songs from some other place on the internet.
B0001MDP3G|3.0|\\"Cold Mountain\\" is somewhat based on the book by Charles Frazier and as one reviewer said, is filmed by Anthony Minghella in an attempt to recreate his success with the romantic \\"The English Patient\\". The \\"English Patient\\" was I believed, an unfilmable novel until I saw the film. It worked. The tragedy in the \\"English Patient\\" was the love story while here, it is the senseless war. This film works because the story is hard to screw up. The war scenes and scenes of Inman's travels back to Cold Mountain are disturbing and haunting. I was really struck by the harshness of that time and the effect of war on women- how difficult it would have been to survive when farms were wiped out by the draft. The failure of this film is that this movie lacks passion in its central relationship. You have to suspend your disbelief and believe there is a relationship- the film does not lend support to the premise that Inman gives up everything for Ida after receiving a letter from her begging him to come home (though that is Hollywood's stamp and not the prime reason for desertion in the book). The 2 love scenes between the leads are particularly dull. Jude Law does a wonderful job as do the supporting cast but the presence of Nicole Kidman strained the film's credibility. What stood out like a red flag for me and ruined the film was the casting of Nicole Kidman. I must admit to not being a fan, but I never disliked her until I saw her in this film which I believe she ruins. With her bleached yellow straw hair contrasting with dark eyebrows, Botox-paralyzed forehead devoid of emotion and Barbie-doll features she fits so poorly into this period-appropriate cast, and God is she a lousy actress here. Renee Zelwegger's line that \\"if I cry one tear for him [father] I stole it from a crocodile\\" is far more applicable to Kidman, whose acting in this film is so contrived. One never forgets she is acting, and an actress. Her technique consists of exaggerated responses- so that rather than becoming the character, she becomes a caricature. Her botox-paralyzed forehead is bizarre and made her displays of emotion especially unbelievable and her performance stands in stark contrast to the subdued Law and ebullient Zelwegger. Were it not for the supporting cast I would not have sat through this film to its end. It is unneccesarily long and repetitive at times. <br /> <br />I suppose this is a particular warning to actresses everywhere- let the botox wear off before you appear in a film! When one is called upon to display emotion, the botox will betray your visit to the plastic surgeon every time. Oh, the wrinkles go- but the artificial frozen look that replaces them is even more bizarre and undisguisable!
B000001FI7|5.0|this stayed in my cd player for frikin ages!! its a desert island cd!!!! cant get enough of it!!! get it now!!!!!
B00005JM02|5.0|Pixar has yet to disappoint me. This is a great family movie and really funny.
B0006A9FMI|5.0|The story is deep and has a lot of philosophical views about \\"the machines\\".  The real star of the show is the amazing blend of 3d and 2d animation.  Just eye candy throughout the whole movie.  I didn't like the caption like subtitles.  If they would of had just had the dialog in subtitles that would of been great.  I don't need to know that a helicopter is making noise when I can hear it perfectly.  Captions would of been great as another subtitle option for the hearing impaired.  Anyway, I really don't understand why people are tripping about the missing English audio.  I thought most anime lovers hated the English audio versions and preferred the Japanese audio with English subtitles version.  Well, whatever, it's still a great movie and worthy of being part of your anime collection.  You love sci-fi and anime, you have to see/buy this movie.
B000007638|5.0|Now if you ask me, and plenty of Wings fans do quite frequently, this here Wings Over America album is just about the best that group come up with in the Bicentennial Year. See, it charted for a total of 86 weeks on the American side of the Atlantic and on the strength of two singles, namely \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" and the James Bond theme song \\"Live and Let Die.\\" This here album was a huge seller and it was because Mr. McCartney was on a roll and the buying public was interested in what he had on offer - particularly catchy pop tunes with irresistible hooks written in. <br /> <br />Mama likes this one plenty good and we listen to it on a frequent basis here in the double wide trailer. I have to admit that I am soft on Paul McCartney, so unless things are really weak I pretty much enjoy his stuff more often than not. This one is not resplendent with weak offering, unlike a few of his other albums, and you'd have to be slobberchopped not to pick up on how good this here album is on first listen. My friend and huntin' companion Clyde \\"Blackie\\" Boyle has this one in his truck at the moment and, truth be node, I believe that scutter actually has my CD in his player because I ain't aware of him every making a purchased of any CD in his entire life. See, he likes to borrow implements and items and kind of use them for a while, then return them when he can get around to it. Well, He done had this CD of mine, and I am quite certain that it is mine, since it was initially released in the CD format. I had to go get me another copy a while back and I guess that is both a testament to how much I like this CD and also to how spineless I am when it comes to being direct and forward with folk who borrowed by thangs and never got around to returning them. <br /> <br />Anyway, I can recommend this CD without hesitation as one of the best that Wings come out with... ever. Get it and make yourself happy - but keep it away from \\"Blackie\\" because that scallywag tends to never get borrowed merchandise back to its rightful owner. <br />
0767834739|5.0|I can't believe the low reviews this movie is getting.  I thought this movie was really entertaining.  The action is awesome, the costumes are right on the money, zombies look great, the women are hot... it's pretty much straight from the video game.  Nemesis looks awesome and Jill looks hot, just like the video game.  It's not as scary as the first one, but it's still good.  The only thing I thought was missing was the creepy electronic soundtrack by Marilyn Manson.  He should of done the music for this movie, it would of been even better.  Anyway, both Resident Evil movies are the best video game movie ever, second being Mortal Kombat.
B0002JJBZE|5.0|...that I did not buy this set in Amazon. I was really thrilled about it so I wanted it right away and I bought it in my country (more expensive, of course)<br /><br />Anyway I dare to use this space to recommend it without hesitation. Not much to say about the episodes, I of course know them from years ago. Video and audio quality are first grade. What is quite nice this time is bonus material. I loved it.<br /><br />Have you read Cervantes's Don Quijote de la Mancha?<br /><br />For me it was like that. I watched the whole set in two days. I was almost convinced the Enterprise really existed and was quite shocked to see such a primitive world outside my window.<br /><br />Seriously. I enjoyed the set and will buy the third season this month (through Amazon this time).<br /><br />After all these years I am really amazed how very good Star Trek is. It is really 20th Century's mhytology.
B0002XVQNU|3.0|I picked this up with a gift card I got for Christmas, since I heard it was a much better cut than the original, and also because I'm into the whole superhero genre.  Anyways, they were right.  It's much better than the original.  While I felt the theatrical cut was so-so, this one has some edge and bite to it.  The characters are fleshed out a bit more, and more screen time is given to the stronger actors in the cast such as Colin Farrell and Jon Favreu.  While, some of the weaker actors such as Jennifer Garner have their scenes trimmed a bit (the love scene for one).  The subplot involving Coolio is good, and adds a bit of mystery to the whole Kingpin connection.  Plus Joe Pantaliano is giving some screen time and has more of a relationship with Matt Murdock, and you can begin to see some mutual respect emerge between the two characters.  This cut turns an average film into a good solid film, that I would still rank quite a bit behind films like Spider-Man 1 & 2, Superman, Blade 2 and Batman, but a bit ahead of films like Hulk and the original Blade.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|to quote another review \\"the subtitle production for the film is atrocious... the only subtitles offered are subtitles for the hearing impaired.\\" <br /> <br />it distracts from the movie so bad that it isn't worth watching! <br /> <br />and even the hearing impaired subs are awful, they sub a song sung in english and dont sub any of the Japinese songs... <br /> <br />when i hear a gun fire and i read a sub {gun noise} it distract from the movie... <br /> <br />the movie seemed to be great and i wish it had been done the the care and technical expertise of the first Ghost in the Shell... <br /> <br />IT SUCKS, DON'T BUY IT AND WRITE DREAMWORKS ABOUT IT...
B00004R99J|4.0|For those who use history as the basis for hating this film, get over it.  Disney was not telling the history of Pocahontas, but the LEGEND of Pocahontas.  As with many historical figures, there are legends surrounding who Pocahontas was, so let's actually look at some of the other big complaints. <br /> <br />1.  They made Pocahontas look much older.  Well, duh.  Do you really want Disney to do a love story of a 12 year old girl and a 30 year old man.  How would that have gone over?  Of course, if they are going to tell the love story, they are going to make the main characters adults. <br /> <br />2.  The sequel shows Pocahontas marrying John Smith.  Apparently you slept through the sequel because it is clear that she chooses John Rolfe in the sequel. (Yes, historically she marries him, converts to Christianity, changes her name to Sarah, and dies before leaving England of syphillis.)  But again, do you really want to explain to your child that this American heroine died of syphillis? <br /> <br />3.  The animal companions/talking tree.  These are representative of the spirit of nature which is sacred to many Native American tribes. <br /> <br />Again, Disney does a really good job of telling the legend.  They never have claimed historical accuracy, because that is not the story they are telling.  Truthfully, the lessons here are wonderful lessons.
0767834739|2.0|As a die hard Resident Evil fan there is a certain amount of consistency I come to expect from the games and even more from the movies.  I loved the first installment, it wasn't based on the games but it had the same feel to it, but Apocalypse is a disjointed montage of things that happened in various games.  Sure I didn't mind many of the inconsistencies to the game to the movie, but get someone who understands how a Beretta operates, the slide locks in place when you're out of ammo.  My biggest issue was the ending, everything made sense how you wouldn't want the story getting out but I think that Paul W.S. Anderson forgot about events in the cold war that led to the establishment of NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) there purpose to track missiles...  Translation you can't nuke the city and get away with it, NORAD has our backs.  Then the refusal to use any other mutant other then Lickers is insulting to the far superior Hunter's of almost every Resident Evil game, 6 foot tall killer decapitating frogs just never gets old.  If you didn't know anything about Resident Evil other then it had zombies and lots of guns then yes you might like this insult to Resident Evil fans but a die-hard such as myself, I had a hard time with number Apocalypse, and when it comes to the next one im going to pretend that the first was the only movie. <br />
068987474X|1.0|For every example they quote to demonstrate that it is futile for the lady to pursue the gentleman, I can find one the other way.  Every guy has gone to a party, met 50 or more people, including 2 interesting women, only to find in the morning that he lost both phone numbers.  He wants to call at least one of tham.  Then, presto, there is an email from Cutie#1 saying \\"It was nice to meet you last night.\\"  He pushes the Reply button, a romance is born, and the second Cutie gets forgotten.  The #1 thing I look for in a woman is SOMEONE WHO LIKES ME. <br /> <br />Men have been known to date women that repulse them, as Slump Busters, if they are tired of being rejected.  To believe that a little \\"playing easy to get\\" cannot matter is lunacy. <br /> <br />Of course, later in the relationship, the authors are more correct: if he's just not that into her, seeing her gets crowded out by life's hassles; if he is, he will move mountains to see her.   <br /> <br />They are also correct that ladies who are way into chasing men defeat themselves: she would do better to spend that time reading a book or doing something interesting, so that when a man says \\"Tell me about yourself,\\" she will have something to really say! <br /> <br />-Rick in Houston
B0001US8EO|5.0|I have seen and heard a lot of rhetoric comparing WYATT EARP with \\"Tombstone\\". In my opinion, there is no comparison. WYATT EARP tells the story of a man, his brothers, and his life in general. The main theme of \\"Tombstone\\" is the infamous gunfight at the OK corral. The movie version is protracted and bloody (not to say that the real fight wasn't) and quite removed from real history. Historians who know of what they speak inform us that the gun fight lasted only a couple minutes and took place at a range of about 7 yards with all the combatants facing each other.In WYATT EARP that has been reasonably faithfully recreated. <br /> <br />When released this movie got some big time boos from some critics, but personally, I've been there before and have seen them shoot down some pretty good flicks and give thumbs up to some real garbage (I.E. EYES WIDE SHUT & THE THIN RED LINE just to cite a couple) <br /> <br />If you like good western movies, rent or buy this one. You won't be disappointed. It's long, but does not drag.
B0001932ZA|3.0|It was between this or the second (but technically the first) Indiana Jones movie or this. I was surprised at myself, wanting to watch Indiana Jones, but it was too long. So this went on instead. I was forewarned about it being too eighties, but I think after you get warned about these things, they're don't jump out as much at you. Only the terrible hair & outfits, but they're only really the noticable things.<br /><br />Stephne King movies have a habit of not being very good. Carrie & The Green Mile are exceptions, along with this. This film is loosely based on a novel written by Stephen King that he penned under the pseudonym of Richard Bachman. He wrote the story in 72 hours, and it was published with virtually no changes.<br /><br />Like 1984, this book/movie was way ahead of its time, and is much more relevant now, than it was then. The ending from the book to movie as changed, and I'm quite curious to find out what happened originally.<br /><br />There are some great lines in this, mainly spoken by Arnie himself and some of the best are:<br /><br />Ben Richards: Killian! I'll be back!<br /><br />Damon Killian: Only in a rerun.<br /><br />Damon Killian: You b*****d! Drop dead!<br /><br />Ben Richards: I don't do requests.<br /><br />Ben Richards: Uplink underground, uplink underground. If you say that one more time, I'll uplink your uplink your ass, and you'll be underground!<br /><br />Ben Richards: [after strangling Sub-Zero with barbed wire)] What a pain in the neck.<br /><br />Amber: [after Richards cut Buzzsaw in half with a chain saw] What happened to Buzzsaw?<br /><br />Ben Richards: He had to split.<br /><br />For a supposed special editon, there's not much in the way of extras, but they include: commentary by producer Tim Zinnemann, director Paul Michael Glaser and executive producer Rob Cohen; \\"Lockdown on Main Street\\": a documentary about the current state of privacy and criminal issues in a post-9/11 society; \\"Game Theory\\": an inside look at reality-TV programming and its cultural impact on society; \\"Meet the Stalkers\\": obtain inside information about the deadliest foes in The Running Man.<br /><br />If you like Arnie, you'll probably adore this movie.

B0000AM6K2|3.0|I came across Josh Rouse and listened to samples of his music on Amazon.com.  I was immediately drawn in by the music - mellow, with a great \\"retro\\" feel, and an R&B smoothness that I would have never expected from a 30 something white guy. <br />However after purchasing the CD I was quite disappointed by its lyrical content.  Lines like \\"you people all know what I'm talking about\\" would be fine if they weren't echoed by a middle-aged man-choir singing \\"yeah you people all know what he's talking about\\".  Furthermore, lines like \\"screwing in a motel room\\", \\"I wanna be your baby daddy\\" and \\"It's the end of the night and I'm feeling sexual\\" sound more like they were written by a 16 year old boy trying to hit on an older woman than a seasoned lyricist such as Rouse.  I was also disappointed by many lines that just seemed thin and meaningless like \\"your building is where we meet / I'm hungry, let's get something to eat\\" and \\"my doctor says I'll feel better soon / fills my vitamin D pills / hands me the big bill\\". <br />Yes, lyrically it lacks substance and is sometimes annoying, but the music is so beautifully crafted that I've found myself listening to it over and over again, trying to block out the lyrics and regard Josh's voice as another instrument. <br />It makes great background music for a quiet day, evening or a mellow get together.
B00023B1LM|2.0|Normally I would expect some subtle differences between a book and movie, but their is so much disparity between the two. Last night I watched this flick growing angrier as the movie went on. The only thing that was the same between the book and the movie was the following: !!!NOTE: SPOILERS AHEAD!!! <br /> <br />1. Bourne does use a woman-but he actually kidnaps her in the book <br />2. There was a bank in the movie-but he doesnt just walk into this high class bank in his dirt/bloody clothes and obtains millions of dollars-it was much more complicated than that. <br />3. There was a treadstone, but the head of treadstone was not killed by someone from treadstone.  <br /> <br />The movie story line is poor as it stands on it's own. Very few things are tied together, we never really learn to care about/for Jason Bourne (why follow the series if you don't like the guy?). The only thing that is worthwhile is the action. If you want to see that go buy a Vin Diesel movie. Don't support lazy screen writers that hack up this wonderful book and series that Robert Ludlum did such a fine job writing.
B00005JMYI|2.0|I wish I bought the regular version.  This \\"unrated version\\" was not as good as the theatrical release, but the DVD commentary was rude, crude, and nothing to do with the movie.  Will Ferrell and Adam McKay spend time coming up with worse and worse swear words to see how much gets bleeped (a lot of it).  Nothing about the movie was discussed at all.  It was insulting.
0156027321|4.0|I'm not a heavy reader, but when something grabs me, I move through it pretty quickly. I spent about 3 weeks getting through the first 80 pages of this story, having a tough time following the backstory of Pi, the main character, and his own coming into several religions while entering his teens. I'm not one for religious discussion, admittedly, so this bored me somewhat, but not altogether. <br /> <br />However, then the story moved to Pi's survival in the open seas on a lifeboat with man-eating creatures and, quite simply, I was hooked to the point of finishing it in a few hours. (Again, I'm not the type to move through most of a book in one day.) I thoroughly enjoy stories of physical survival and equally enjoy learning about zoological behavior, of which this book is filled. If you're not interested in exquisite detail of survival technique and step-by-step procedures of characters striving to maintain their existance (regardless if it's believable), you will probably think it's quite a slow read. I, however, enjoyed this aspect the most. <br /> <br />That some bad reviews mention their disbelief in some of the plot shouldn't bother you, unless you truly cannot suspend your own disbelief. Unfortunately, many reviewers have spoiled the ending, which I will try not to imitate. And in my own defense, if you didn't already know it was mostly about survival in the open seas, you clearly didn't see the cover of the book) :) <br /> <br />The ending does offer a twist of sorts to make you think. Some apparantly find it repulsive or unsatisfying. True enough, the book starts with the assertion that this story can make you believe in God, which, after coming to the conclusion, has miffed quite a few people. While not miffed, I do agree this claim is questionable, but that doesn't stop me from appreciating the fine philosophical points the ending of this interesting story helps illustrate. <br /> <br />This is a story of survival mixed with elements of spiritual and philosophical enlightenment. The potential for enlightenment does not present itself until the end and does not, apparantly, present itself to everyone. But I like taking chances, so I hope those who are like me will take a chance on this book and judge for yourself.
015603008X|5.0|Severely retarded Charlie's heartbreaking journey to genius, and, sadly, back again can't help but inspire, especially in this day of genetic engineering. Can we change a person, what will happen if we do, and should we do it at all? What is the cost to the individual? This book still makes me cry every time I read it. Highly recommend for sci-fi fans and anyone else

B000063S6Z|3.0|I was at the public library one day and I saw this CD.  Being a world-class tight wad, I checked it out and burned it when I got home.  Free music sounds better.  This CD is pretty good.  I'd give it three and a half stars.  It gets pretty repetitive after a while, but it's worth a listen or two.  Find it at your local library.  Take that, recording industry.
B00005RHGL|5.0|Some critics like to to point out that this more isn't all <br />the way accurate... Big Deal! It's a movie! If I wanted a <br />complete accurate story I'd read the book or something... <br />Anyway, this movie is very well acted with Val Kilmer having <br />his best and last good role.... But as somebody said, you <br />can't forget Russell's acting in this movie. He is pretty <br />good and believeable. I'm sad that they didn't get more out <br />of Sam Elliot out of this one.... He is a vet of these type <br />of movies... But seems to really fade into the background <br />too much. One person that should have been left out is Bill <br />Paxton... He is too much of a wiesel for a movie like this.
B000002U82|1.0|I am very disappointed with this album after all the hype surrounding it.It has no energy and is very depressing. Time is the only decent song of the 9 on this album. And the album relies too much on special effects, and the vocals are void of any emotion. Save your money. Led Zeppelin are 10 times better.
B0006399FS|5.0|U2 is a band with power and grace, along with a world wide following rivalling that of the Beatles. \\"Bomb\\" is an album release that forgets all of that and remembers how this band started, and the music that propelled them to the superstardom they have now acheived. Dispite all of the popularity they have already acheived, the experimental music they have created, and the political crusading Bono has done on the side, this band has come together again to create a masterpiece. \\"Bomb\\" goes somewhere this band has not been since \\"War\\", their souls. With heart wretching lyrics in \\"Miracle Drug\\" to the memory of making it in \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" the songs on this album encompass the emotions of the small Irish band we have come to know and love. U2 stood up and made an album they were proud of and with music they were insired with. Producing work like this is why U2 is still the biggest band in the world, and why they will continue to be together, making great music of the soul until their dying day.
B000002J03|5.0|Nobody touches this album in rock history. Its worth the money just for \\"A whole Lotta Love\\". Any serious rock collection must include this album and Zoso. Enough said.
0783229526|5.0|Johnny Depp is excellent as Hunter S. Thompson, and Benicio del Toro is great as his lawyer, the late Oscar Zeta Acosta.  Yeah, yeah, I know... Bill Murray was good as the great HST in Where the Buffalo Roam too, but Depp just has this style... and Fear and Loathing is just SO FUNNY! Some reviewers mentioned that you don't have to be drugged up to enjoy this movie and they are right, altho I can say from experience that it makes the movie 10x better! This movie almost mirrors the book but witnessing the characters in motion and seeing the scenery and places instead of just reading about them is just AMAZING. Terry Gilliam is briliant and accurately portrayed some of Ralph Steadman's best rederings from the book (HST's fav British illustrator). The movie also has the weirdest cameos by some of the most random A-listers and... pseudo-celebrities; like Penn from Penn and Teller, Cameron Diaz, Christina Ricci, Gary Busey, Flea from Red Hot Chilli Peppers, and even Tobey Maguire as one of the FREAKIEST LOOKING HITCH HIKERS. And the best thing about this movie is everytime I watch it (and I watch it A LOT) I see something I never noticed before.  Even HST makes a breif appearance! Some may believe this is a movie for druggies and that it doesn't make any sense, but that's not true.  It's a collection of musings, observations, and ideaologies written by one of the most controversial, outspoken yet brilliant journalists of all time.  The book/movie was compiled from 2 trips Thompson made to Vegas, but he claims that he was searching for the American Dream.  Did he find it???  Uhhhh...  well watch the movie and see for yourself... ok by the end of the movie it's hard to tell but the adventure is worth it, hard conclusion or not.      *hint* in the book the American Dream was supposedly a huge dilapidated black building down the street from some taco restaurant or something, or so someone claimed....
B00000DOZ4|5.0|The great phenomenon of 70s rock. This album is a milestone in rock history Jimi Page is second only to Hendrix in rock guitar history.And his immortal riff on the incredible opener \\"Whole Lotta Love is amazing togther with the heavy bassline of Jones. The talent these four guys had will never be surpassed. Whole Lotta love, Heart Breaker and Moby Dick sisplay the amazing musicianship of Plant,Page,Jones and Bonham. Any serious rock collection must include this album and Zoso.
B0002DKCMG|4.0|Pretty hilarious piece of teen comedic trash.  The excess of nudity in the nude beach scene is a bit eccentric being a heterosexual male, but otherwise it's so fricken funny your stomach hurts.  Hilarious, but weird!
B0000640VO|4.0|This is a funny movie.  You have to sit close to the TV though so you can read all the sub-titles.<br /><br />I think a lot of big budget movies are made with only a single good idea to go on.  This movie has some fifteen good ideas - good solid funny or quirky story ideas - to entertain us.<br /><br />There is, however, some sex here and there, so you have to be careful.  I think it would be just as good a movie without it, but the movie maker goes for some sex gags (and is not shy about showing flesh) even though they are not actually that funny.  Ah well.<br /><br />The actress who plays Amelie is adorable.  She is the centerpiece of the movie, but she has a lot of help making things work.  There are quite a few unique and fun characters coming and going throughout the story.  The little girl who plays Amelie at age 6 opens the movie, and she steals our hearts with her innocence.  My favorite part of the movie is when this 6 year old exacts revenge on her soccer-fan neighbor.<br /><br />But a lot of imagination is used in this movie ... and it is all fun.  Just a fun ride (for us) around Paris, France.
B000002LOE|1.0|After the release of this album, REM have went on to make some really great albums, such as \\"Automatic For The People\\", \\"Up\\" and \\"Around The Sun\\". So thankfully they have made up for writing possibly the worst song in history \\"shiny happy people\\". \\"Near wild heaven\\" and \\"radio song\\" are not much better, those songs are so unlike REM and i'll never forgive them. The rap in \\"The outsiders\\" from \\"Around the sun\\" is sensible and fits in well with the song but on \\"radio song\\" the rapping is ridiculous and childish (it reminds me of Usher). This band is probably the greatest alternative rock band ever, they should never have made an album so happy and pop-orientated.
B0002UXBD6|5.0|I liked American Idiot (the single) but wasn't sure about buying the album until I heard Boulevard of Broken Dreams.  When I heard that song I knew that I had to buy the album.  It is so great to have a cd that really attacks Bush with thought.  Jesus of Suburbia is great, though some of the lyrics are hard to understand (but they give you the lyrics).  Holiday is my favorites song on the album because it has a cool beat and anti-war lyrics.  This is a great cd and I recommend it to anyone who likes punk music and hates Bush.
0887307280|5.0|When Gerber started his Emyth revolution in 1977, I'm sure he didn't have a clue as to how successful his approach was going to be: Over 25,000 small business clients from every industry on all major continents! <br /> <br />Now, 27 years later, he's still going strong. See his latest book: \\"E-Myth Mastery - The Seven Essential Disciplines for Building a World Class Company\\" <br /> <br />If you are a business owner struggling to control your life, make money, and enjoy your family, the Emyth message is timely and useful. <br /> <br />As a business owner and founder myself, I find Gerber's perspective invigorating (not to mention life-saving).

B000002UAU|1.0|Just wanted to let people know that this album has some satanic ties. Myself being a lover of rock music I realized some of the messages being conveyed were satanic. Notice on the album cover of this album, there is a picture of Aleister Crowley (top left second person)the biggest Devil Worshipper who started a satanic following. Listen to the lyrics they sound innocent but listen closely. The message given is \\"Start A Revolution\\" \\"Do What Thou Will\\", Those are teachings of Crowley, also notice the statue on the cover (bottom right under the BEETLES) That statue is mentioned in many of crowleys teachings. Guess who Sgt Pepper is... Yup Crowley!! Notice the lyric \\"It was 20 years ago today...Sgt Pepper taught the band to play\\" Just wanted to give a warning to those who didn't know! Why do you think this band got so big!!
B00028HBKC|1.0|I viewed this film as a DVD rental last evening. It is beyond me what the intent of making this film was. It seems to revel in the portrayal of gore, viloence, and human suffering while almost consciously avoiding the relevance of Jesus' teachings.  <br /> <br />The movie is so quick to get to seeing Jesus in pain that it can't be bothered with the Last Supper. I can't believe people found any value in this film. It's as if the Director wished only to employ every modern film-making technique available to assail the viewer with graphic scenes of violence and torment. The actual teachings of Jesus take less than second-seat to the need for the film to portray inventive ways of torturing Jesus. <br /> <br />I found a recent viewing of Jesus of Nazareth to be an act of artistic genius compared to this travesty. At least that film attempted to convey some meaningful message to the viewer other than \\"glad that didn't happen to me\\". The Passion is an astrocious film and I can't see it making any meaningful contribution other than showing how badly a Actor turned Director can go astray. Avoid it; you won't miss a thing worth seeing.
6305603847|4.0|FIRST OF ALL DON'T BUY THIS VERSION, THERE IS A NEW 25th ANNIVERSARY EDITION COMING OUT ON JANUARY 28th 2005. It's cheaper then this version and it also comes in a cool fold/case thing that look like the wall.  <br /> <br />Well as everyone has said there is no diologue in this movie thats why it got 4 stars. The album is great and is my favorite of all time but the movie needed diologue. Well the good about this is that there is a commentary and that part deserves a full 5 star rating. Roger Waters really tells us what's going on throughout the movie. There are also 2 documentaries that are really good. I gotta admit I did have to take a break from this movie for 10 minutes because I was getting a little tired near the end. The album/music is really what gives this movie a great rating but it's still a good dvd for your PF collection.
B00005JGAB|5.0|I was 15 in 1976, when this album knocked my socks off.  This Christmas I gave the CD to my own 15-year-old son, a neo-punk.  He was flabbergasted.<br /><br />In listening to it with him, I began to wonder whether Joey, Tommy, Johnny and Dee Dee were the smartest, most ironic jokers and geniuses or the luckiest dumbasses ever to cut an album.  And I realized that it doesn't matter.  The result was genius either way.<br /><br />For what it's worth, I also gave the kid Never Mind the Bollocks, London Calling and (the Iggy collection) Nude and Rude.  I haven't stopped hearing them all leaking out of his headphones since.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I viewed this film this past weekend and i'm ashamed to say that i had never seen it before.  The acting was the best, story telling, music, design of the movie was all wonderful.  I realize that this film is rated the \\"Best of Hollywood\\" and i can understand why.  My only fault that i see with this film, and it might just be me, but i don't think it's a film you could watch over and over again.  But don't let that stop you from really enjoying and great piece of work and i'm so glad i finally know who \\"Rosebud\\" was.  Great work of Americana!
B00005JMUL|5.0|\\"The Polar Express\\" is outstanding! The visual look of the film is amazing. The new motion capture is brilliant. Tom Hanks is impressive in 6 roles. Those roles are Hero Boy, Hero Boy's Father, Conductor, Hobo, Scrooge, and Santa Claus. He voices 5 of them and his motion capture is on all 6 of them. Robert Zemeckis' directing is excellent. The powerful emotion of the movie stays with you even until after the movie is over.
B00011D1RC|1.0|I was expecting a flawless transfer a la par with the MGM tradition but it was not to be.  <br /> <br />I hope the people at Warner Bros. will pay attention and give us a truly Deluxe Edition of Garbo's most famous movies, such as Queen Christina, Camille, Anna Karenina, Ninotchka, and Anna Christie (German and English versions).
B0002858YS|5.0|\\"Hot Fuss\\" by The Killers is my favourite album of 2004. It's a great listen. There are alot of catchy tunes and you'll find yourself humming them by the end of the day. This CD hasn't come out of my CD player for months. The beats are addictive and if you get this album you won't regret buying it. By listening to this album, there's no doubt that this band has alot more good music to offer in the future.  <br /> <br />Best tracks: Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine, Mr. Brightside, Somebody Told Me, On Top, Change Your Mind <br /> <br />a.
B00006RU5B|5.0|People, THIS IS THE REAL DEAL.  My previous review for this album was very very stupid and failed completely in conveying the emotional link I have with this gorgeous album.  This is my penitence.<br /><br />There is something beautifully ragged about rock'n'roll.  Some more experimental outfits such as A Perfect Circle, Linkin Park, Tool, or Silverchair and other such things can be very enjoyable and amazing and stuff, but nothing can strike the same chord with me like good ole AMERICAN rock'n'roll bands, such as the Foo Fighters, Pearl Jam, Aerosmith, Fuel, Jet(not really American, but not really Canadian either), and AUDIOSLAVE.  Audioslave just kinda shrieks of genuine, solid, unrepentant rock'n'roll, which is more than can be said for the Nickelbacks(poor Canadians) and Bush's(the band, not the president you idiots) of the world.  There is beauty indefinable within the digital confines of this cd, something that no true rock fan will achieve a good night's sleep without.<br /><br />Which isn't to say that Audioslave doesn't experiment with their songs.  Guitarist Tom Morello has taken his guitar to infinity and beyond many a day back when the band was known as Rage Against the Machine.  Tommy is almost slaved to his love for strange, quirky little noise-making tricks that now submerge in Audioslave, but to an albeit lesser degree.  And his trademark chugging, bouncing riffs are still everywhere to be seen, but when all of this is added to the sacred vocals of Chris Cornell, a higher degree of rock'n'rollishness is achieved.<br /><br />Chris has got to be just about the greatest vocalist of all time.  Or, y'know, one of them.  And after decades of screeching into microphones, this man can still go from mellow, musical crooning, straight into roaring, bloody-ape-monster-gut-crushing screams that would make even Chester Bennington whimper in fear.  Two words, baby!: ROCK AND ROLL.  That's three words, if you're paying attention.  This is two:  ROCK ROLL!  But that doesn't make any sense, so we'll go with the former.<br /><br />GAWL DANG, there are too many out of this world songs to know where to start.  This is one of those albums where like, 7 of the songs are your favorites, but if I were to have a super-ultra-mega-unknown favorite track, it's name would be `Gasoline'.  Rousing guitar melodies and huge, screaming vocal choruses are king of everything on this album, but it all reaches its incredibly high peak on `Gasoline'.  It's that good of a track.<br /><br />Other songs that most people of heard by now include `Cochise', a song that I coulda sworn was AC/DC the first time I heard it; `Show Me How To Live', which I have heard about 50 billion times and still love it to death, FANTASTIC RIFF; `What You Are', rocking, terrorizing song that is as beautiful as it is loud, and it IS loud; `Like A Stone' & `I Am The Highway' are both some of the best ballads I've heard in the past 5 years or so, A Perfect Circle aside.<br /><br />Many other songs on the album will cater to those who appreciate these radio wonders.  The songs rock rock rock all night long and in all the best possible ways.  `Light My Way', `Shadow of the Sun', and `Exploder' all follow a hard, loud, head-banging recipe that is just delectable.  `Getaway Car' and `the Last Remaining Light' are two more soft numbers, the latter being the better of the two, though `Getaway Car' is much more enjoyable than most give it credit for.  `Set It Off' has the best chorus from any band I've heard in the past few years, and `Hypnotize' is worthy of mention, simply because all I can see when I listen to it is disco lights, a disco ball, and hundreds of dancing fools swaying to the groovy beat.<br /><br />So I mean, this Audiolave stuff is a must have for those who need more ROCK, with a bit of experimentation for catharsis' sake.  For those who THINK they have rock, you put down your silly little Nickelback album and go listen to Audioslave about fifty times.  It truly is aGARDEN of SOUND(wink-wink)..  It truly is a GARDEN of SOUND(wink-wink).
B00006CXXU|5.0|\\"Stripped\\" is a great album and it clearly shows Christina Aguilera's range vocally, lyrically, and artistically. This is one of the best albums I've heard in 2002. Aguilera has successfully broken out of the bubblegum pop phenomenon and shocases this diverse set of amazing music and this album proves that she is here to stay in the music bussiness for a very long time. \\"Stripped\\" is a lengthy album clocking in at 77 minutes but every minute is worth listening to. It's filled with potential radio/billboard hits like Impossible, Get Mine Get Yours,and Cruz and the already number one hits like Dirrty, Beautiful, and Fighter. \\"Stripped\\" is an amazing album and make sure you have this masterpiece in your CD collection.  <br /> <br />Best tracks: Walk Away, Infatuation, The Voice Within, Beautiful, Fighter  <br /> <br />a.
B0002X314C|5.0|If you don't have this CD, you are not taking 2005 seriously! I went to 3 stores to find it!.....Well worth the wait!
0553801546|5.0|I couldn't read this book fast enough, but it is impossible to read this book quickly.  This is not an action book.  It is a character driven novel, but that does not mean that it lacks action.  Robin Hobb develops characters like few others.  I found myself alternatively furious with Fitz and then cheering him on.  I'm not a big fan of First Person narrative since it limits exposure to other characters, but this book couldn't have been written any other way.   <br /> <br />This was an extemely satisfying ending to three very good series.    All the characters evolve and grow as the pages turn and each one is satisfyingly complete when the book is done. <br /> <br />Before starting the book, my expecations for FitzChivalry's and the Fool's relationship were sky high.  As I read, I felt a little let down by that devolpment, but when I wrapped up the entire book, I felt a real since of satisfaction.
0767803434|4.0|Another great performance by Harrison Ford. This is a nice action film that moves along quickly, making it wonderful entertainment!
0743455967|5.0|Very enjoyable reading.  King gives an interesting perspective on the crraft of writing.  Part memoir and part how-to guide.  This is highly recommended for King fans, for those interested in getting started in writing or for those who have done some writing already.  King doesn't have the respect of many academics, but his perspective on writing is worth reading because he is a successful writer and solid pro.
B000059H98|3.0|This movie is pretty funny. But since it was based on an already popular graphic novel illustrated by Jaime Hewlett (who also drew the Gorillaz), fans were greatly dissapointed. Tank Girl was originally Australian, but Lori Petty plays her like some tough new yorker chick. I really didn't like the special effects makeup of the kangaroo people, known in the movie as the Rippers.  They were really cute in the comic, but looked really creepy in the movie. So, in closing in my review, I have one more thing to say that I'm sure all other Tank Girl fans would agree with. THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE THE WHOLE MOVIE ANIMATED!!!!!!!! It would have done a whole lot better.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Okay...I never wanted to review this album simply because of all the wonderful things I have to say about it. Where to begin? Where to end? but I thought of a good title to sum it all up. <br /> <br />\\"Time warp\\" is my title to my review simply because you can play this album on the radio 10 years from now and people would be jammin like the album came out yesterday. Most R&B/hip hop albums come out with the hottest producers of the time and the music sounds just as every other track that the producer has out on the radio. Therefore, hearing a song years from now, you could approximately guess what year it was from just from the stylings. But this album is different. There are no boundaries to this album. The music is universal. It is touching, thoughtful, and honest. Nothing can make a great album without them ingrediants.  <br /> <br />Her voice was hidden behind her rapping for years and it was a shock to hear the beauty that came out on this album. She loves life, music, and her surroundings and takes them for what they are. The miseducation should be anyone's education of a piece of \\"untouchable\\" art. This here is an album for the history books.
6305095442|5.0|I honestly dont care about the other evil dead movies but \\"evil dead 2: dead by dawn\\" because the other ones does not even come close to the intense and gory as dead 2 does and the funny parts and disturbing parts to me are classics. I consider this film to be both  black comedy as well as horror and they both go very well together.  evil dead 2 can make you laugh,  feel disgusted and makes you ask \\"what the f*ck? \\" during the movie. Its a truly masterpiece. If you lvoe horror films and you dont own evil dead 2 ? Kill yourself because your not a real horro fan untill you own evildead 2. Highly recommended.
B00003CXBK|5.0|at first, i never was really interested in this movie until i've seen all the reviews everyone made(most of them said it was good)so i got more interested in Princess Mononoke. i first bought the cd which has amazing music.i just bought my dvd earlier this week and let me tell you, it is truly an amzing movie. i watched it 3 times already and i still have not grown tired of it. Sure, it has some violent scenes but besides that it is a very good movie. I am just 13 and I have loved this movie. Although this movie is very good, i recommend it is not a movie for children because of all the violence but if you are old enough, it will seem like a good movie.
B00030590I|2.0|The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of what this DVD wasn't .... what it wasn't was a remake of 'Crouching Tiger' which I certainly will never forget .... that walking on leaves stupidity was only outdone by the poisoning scene that dragged out more than Steely Dan's Revival disks ...  <br /> <br /> <br />OK so Hero has what the great modern Chinese films have, colour, pagentry and a sense of history. What is lacks is writing skill and character development....in trying to appeal to a broad based US audience I guess the writers and directors took the brains out of the movie .... At least they didn't walk on water since there's only one character in my mind that can bring that off convincingly !!! <br /> <br /> <br />Forget it ..... wait for this on Showtime .....
B00001OH80|2.0|This album really depressed me when I originally bought it on vinyl way back in the '80's.   <br /> <br />\\"Let's Dance,\\" while obviously rather lightweight compared to Bowie's previous recordings, was at least catchy and its \\"retro\\" sound, NO synthesizers, was adventurous for the synth-heavy early '80's.  But \\"Tonight\\" sounds muddled, like Bowie wasn't quite sure what he was doing.  The master of re-invention wasn't re-inventing himself anymore.  There is no focus on this recording.  It is a hodge-podge of musical styles.  David Bowie, arguably, could be said to be playing \\"himself,\\" and not Ziggy, or the Thin White Duke, etc.  But at this time in his career, I don't think Bowie even knew who he was or what he was doing.  This is what depressed me about this album as a huge Bowie fan.  I felt Bowie was putting out \\"product.\\"   <br /> <br />It's also sad to think that the Iggy tune, \\"Neighborhood Threat,\\" is probably the best song on this album.  \\"Tonight,\\"along with the albums which came after it during this decade, are arguably the nadir of Bowie's career.  \\"Let's Dance\\" was a weak album, but compared with what came after it in the '80's, it was Bowie's '80's masterpiece.
0393035158|5.0|What an excellent book, and, as an added bonus, it's also a very easy read of a pretty tough topic. It's also easy to understand the great temptation for readers/reviewers in this forum to take Harris work and twist it as a criticism of president Bush and his strong Christian faith, but, I think that they sorely missed the point.       In the end I believe that the author wants us to become critical thinkers, not judgemental, about the role of Faith religion ... etc in our lives.... And that he most certainly does with a clear cut, concise and surgical manner. It hardly takes a nuclear engineer to come to the conclusion that most of the wars that have been fought since man strutted out of a cave have been a direct or indirect result of religious beliefs, but what makes this book interesting is the position of the author that many 'modern' wars have not ended in decisive battles, like the Aztecs, where the winning army ate the loosing army, but rather ended in a truce whereby the war may have ended but the hate continues to fester, grow and strengthen! I guess it's just like an infection, unless you kill it, it will probably return stronger and stronger and returns impervious to antibiotics that may have done the job from day one ...       Harris bring home the point, frightenly so, that today, with the advent of nuclear, biogical and what have you weapons, a very few people can in effect bomb or infect mankind back into caves, and it will be our foolish and unquestioning 'Christian' ethics that will allow this to happen! Silly enough, if anything, Harris is proposing that rather than a Christian President Bush what we really need today is Ghengis Kahn if we are going to have any hope of a long term future for mankind.      After reading this book you won't ever ask where are those WMD but rather you'll ask 'right or wrong' is this really the end of the war, am I risking my family's life in giving the enemy the 'benefit of the doubt'.... is our blind faith going to the END of REASON??? The author doesn't tell us to loose our faith but rather just says ... OK let's talk about that elephant in the room .. OK ...       Certainly a well written book and a must read for any thinking man of faith .....
B0000787FH|3.0|Am I the only one out there who sees a steady decline in the quality of EC's albums from \\"This Year's Model\\" (his best) to \\"Goodbye Cruel World\\" (his worst)?   <br /> <br />I'm going out on a limb, but I think EC's first two albums are the finest work he ever did.  \\"My Aim is True\\" features excellent lyrics with musical accompaniment provided by a hired backup band, Clover.  \\"This Year's Model\\" was an improvement.  It featured the work of EC's own band, the Attractions, who added a tightness to the sound because these tunes had been refined on the road.  \\"This Year's Model\\" also had lyrics which included many puns, but they worked well.  The puns didn't overshadow the lyrics, and the tight, visceral music drove everything home with perfection. <br /> <br />After \\"This Year's Model\\" EC broadened his lyrical and musical approach.  The lyrics became denser and oftentimes featured puns evolving into more puns.  The music became broader and incorporated more styles.  After their second album, EC and the Attractions toured constantly with rare breaks for more recording. <br /> <br />\\"Imperial Bedroom\\" is the result of a composer and a band that has had too much touring and too many nights of chemical abuse.  The lyrics sound good, but are so obtuse they could mean anything.  And in meaning anythng, they could just as easily mean nothing.  The music sounds good, but takes us in so many directions we end up wondering where we went and question whether we should have spent the time going there in the first place.  The album leaves you disoriented.  The listener feels an unpleasant combination of jet lag and hangover. <br /> <br />EC's albums from \\"Armed Forces\\" up to \\"Goodbye Cruel World\\" leave me feeling this strange combination of jet lag and hangover.  I feel like I've seen and heard life from EC's vantage point of airports, vans, bars, and recording studios.  But I feel like I don't quite understand what I've seen and heard.  The result is like seeing the world passing by from a window, either a jet window or a van window, and getting a vague image that passes through your senses quickly only to be replaced my another vague image.  This is the way I feel listening to EC's lyrics on these post-\\"This Year's Model\\" albums.  Individual songs don't mean anything specific, they are collections of images and puns which mean everything or nothing.  Entire albums are obtuse because they are merely a collection of individual songs that don't mean anything specific. <br /> <br />I've listened to \\"Imperial Bedrooms\\" regularly since I first bought it on vinyl back in 1982.  I still don't \\"understand\\" the album.  It is enjoyable to listen to, but I never feel the way I do when I listen to EC's first two albums. <br /> <br />Maybe there's something wrong with me?  But I prefer EC when he was young, angry, and focused.
B00005JKNF|1.0|This DVD has all the earmarks of somethng that I should have liked .... even critical acclaim .... BUT ... I had real troube tying to build up any empathy for any of the characters and, whats worse, has some real problems in even following the story ....  <br /> <br /> <br />The DVD basically throws 30 or so people together in an English country mansion for a weekend of pheasant shooting. There are of course the wealthy and the very wealthy with their attendant maids, valets and butlers ... and of course, thrown into the mix are poor aspiring singers/actors and a film director from California who just happened to be both a vegetarian and of Jewish descent. Cute ....  <br /> <br /> <br />OK so the movie is a whodoneit and it pretty well is a cheap version of the CLUE game, only difference is that in the game it's easier to follow the characters ... in Gosford park there are so many stories and character goodies thrown into the mix I think even the writers got bored in trying to tie all the pieces together....  <br /> <br /> <br />You want great DVD fare the I suggest you buy the set of The Forsythe Saga ..... <br />
B00000JSJC|5.0|This is a masterpiece. Great characters, great plot, a lot of action and imput for a deep reflection about our future and our nature. And a marvelous love story.
6305907145|3.0|It irked me that this director took so many liberties with Austen's story. Jane is so good she needs no help. There are plenty of Hollywood movies that make a social statement- I wanted Jane Austen, not filmdom political commentary. Also, after having seen Justine Waddell in Wives and Daughters, I realized she would have made a terrific Fannie Price. Casting Waddell as the younger sister (small role) was like having Peyton Manning on your team but using him as the backup quarterback.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Were this band American, people would be screaming, \\"Grammy!\\" From end to end this is THE BEST CD I HAVE EVER HEARD! The CD opens up with a heavily gothic / Operatic number called \\"Dark Chest Of Wonders\\" that will astound you the moment you hear it. Track two, \\"Wish I Had an Angel\\" continues this trend with a more intense \\"Rob Zombie Meets Modern Day Opera\\" feel. This thing could have been in Van Helsing....<br /><br />Other tracks of note are \\"Ghost Love Score\\", \\"Kuolema Tekke Taiteilijan\\", and \\"Nemo\\" which is the single that reached the top of UK Charts.<br /><br />Nightwish is a Powermetal act lead by a Soprano front woman who's talent can be described as unmatched in this industry. Following the band is a full Orchestra produced almost identically to the one on Metallica's \\"S & M\\" CD.<br /><br />American Nu Metal fans will whine, no doubt, that Tarja Turunen sucks because she can actually sing and not scream. If you think Fred Durst is a genius, you should probably look elsewhere...<br /><br />On a similar note, if you believe for one minute what All-Music Guide Said, \\"...Following in the footsteps of the Gathering and Lacuna Coil (goth-influenced \\"symphonic\\" metal bands with female vocalists)\\", you have been mis-informed... Nightiwsh has been around MUCH LONGER than Lacuna Coil, and also, contrary to the article, sound NOTHING like Lacuna.<br /><br />If you like GREAT MUSIC, buy this CD... If you want to try something new, again, BUY THIS CD... However, if you think Nu Metal is innovative, than may I suggest you go worhip Mr. Durst.<br /><br />[...]

0060537639|5.0|This book is pretty long and so full of all kinds of facts and very well thought out ideas. It took me a couple of weeks to finish it.  <br /> <br />But this is a book that everyone should read. It is so clear, so convincing. There is really no arguing with it.  <br /> <br />Someone should make a new movie about 1492, and a whole series about 1421-1423. It makes more sense now that Columbus thought that he had reached China, or Chinese territory. There were Chinese artifacts there, and he had heard reports of Chinese ships coming across the Atlantic from the area of the Grand Banks.  <br /> <br />Can't go into it all here. Just an amazing book of amazing work. Goes to show that dedicated amateur historians can outclass professional historians if they have the discipline and energy.  <br /> <br />Just amazing.
B000002UJQ|5.0|If you download their albums you don't give them a fair try, 'cause the music and the albumcover belong together, and it gives a + to the songs (which are good on their one, btw) <br />anyway, because its a concept-album with good music, you surrely have to buy this album
B0002X314C|5.0|It is very rare to find a cd that you can play from beginning to end without skipping songs in between.  Ever since I bought it, my stereo hasn't played another cd.  I absolutely love track 3, \\"I used to love you\\" and his ballad \\"Ordinary People\\", is one of the most beautiful and truthful songs about love that I have ever heard.  He's got and incredible voice that matches his incredible talent.  I would highly recommend this album.  I've even buying copies to give to my friends.
0767834739|1.0|I rented this movie last night, and I honestly feel cheated spending 5 dollars to view it. The storyline has more plotholes than you can drive a sequel through.<br />Yes the 'final battle' is as terrible as you've heard, featuring a different camera angle about every 1 to 2 seconds for most of its duration, which will probably leave you dizzy and disoriented instead of thrilled.<br />This movie isn't worth the time to watch even if you're watching it for free. Just stay far away from it.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Back in 2001, The Strokes were hyped to the breaking point. \\"The saviors of rock, the second coming of The Velvet Underground, the second coming of Jesus\\"...whatever. The point is, even though their debut album \\"Is This It?\\" was a cool (and very refreshing) retro-sounding record, they most definitely were NOT the \\"next big thing\\" that NME had claimed, and from that point on, everyone assumed that any hyped NYC band would be painted with the same \\"let-down\\" brush.<br /><br />Interpol managed to lay low during late 2001 and 2002 while they made their own record, but when it finally came out, critics heads turned & jaws dropped at what they had created. AMG, Pitchfork, Entertainment Weekly, and E! Online all gave the album rave reviews...and for good reason. \\"Turn On The Bright Lights\\" is an absolutely amazing Joy Division-inspired gloom-rock achievement, second only to Modest Mouse's \\"The Moon & Antarctica\\" in the race for best album of the 00's.<br /><br />To put it simply, there isn't a single filler track on the record. Every song sounds impressive, different and fully fleshed out (most of them run for 4 or 5 minutes, no lame 2 minute blusters here). Throughout the record, dark, gloomy guitars bludgeon your ears into a state of hypnosis, menacing, punkish bass lines make the foundation far below, drums shift from casual to aggressive and back again, and Paul Banks sings of loneliness, sex, desperation, and plans that have yet to take place. Highlights include \\"PDA\\" (probably the best mainstream rock song since Radiohead's \\"Paranoid Android\\"), which features chill-inducing eight-note guitarwork that ring out like fire alarms over a city night; and an instrumental second half reminiscent of a rainy day (along with some awesome back-up vocals from Daniel Kessler), \\"Obstacle 1\\", a bleak, thrashing piece with tormented vocals and some very impressive drumming by Sam Fogarino, the mainly instrumental album intro \\"Untitled\\" with it's huge, booming bass, and the hilarious lyrics (My best friend's from Poland, and ummm...he has a beard/but they caught him with his case in a publice place/that is what we had feared) on the very danceable \\"Roland\\".<br /><br />With the album's influence already seen in albums like \\"Bows + Arrows\\" and \\"Franz Ferdinand\\", God knows how many future albums will borrow a bit from this masterpiece. Mark my words: \\"Turn On The Bright Lights\\" will be looked back on as an indie rock classic in 10 years.hilarious lyrics (My best friend's from Poland, and ummm...he has a beard/but they caught him with his case in a publice place/that is what we had feared) on the very danceable \\"Roland\\". <br /> <br />With the album's influence already seen in albums like \\"Bows + Arrows\\" and \\"Franz Ferdinand\\", God knows how many future albums will borrow a bit from this masterpiece.

B00005JNBQ|1.0|Only stoners and 10-year olds would like this one-joke movie. It's like one of those SNL skits that are stretched to feature-length films.  <br /> <br />The skit, in this instance, is hardly bearable to begin with.
B0000026NC|3.0|Like so many fans, I was was weened on Dark Side, Wish You were <br />Here, Animals, and The Wall.  Water's depature seemed like the <br />end.  One ugly law suit, the boys were back in business and <br />Momentary Lapse of Reason was released.  I gobbled that up along <br />with a ticket to see them in Hartford in the fall of '88. <br />The show, though it did not compare to having just seen Roger <br />Waters on the Radio KAOS tour, was still enjoyable.   <br /> <br />Sadly, this album poorly captures the energy of that reunion <br />leaving the listener feeling even further from the band then <br />imaginable, which is amusing considering this problem is one <br />of the VERY themes of The Wall.  If live post waters is what <br />you seek, I strongly reccomend PULSE.
0312263120|1.0|if you've read any of dan brown's other books, you probably already know the storyline of this book.  all of his books have similar characters and are written with the same formula. the details he included about cryptography were very basic, not very exciting, and extremely predictable. the mysteries the characters have to solve are simplistic and i was able to solve in 10 seconds what it took the characters 4 chapters to figure out.  i know many readers are going to think this review is a load of you know what, but then again, most reviews on amazon are.  then again, maybe it'll save someone a few bucks.
B00000163G|5.0|When I first bought this Tupac album in 1996 I was at a different mindset in place spiritually. Now I make it point not to buy explict albums.  I have always been a fan of Tupac he was a evolution had he lived he would have been Living Legend in his art form of writing a creating his words into music you really felt his fun, pain, sorrow and sadness.  I blieve this album was a defining moment from him released from Prison and new label and coming out with this album was reflection a soul so ahead of his time his music will live on for years, years to come.  Thanks to his mother developing and keeping his vision and mission alive.  Some of my favorite songs are Califoria Love.  Just some other songs I really like.   <br />12. California Love (RMX) [Remix] - Dr. Dre    <br />13. I Ain't Mad at Cha - Danny Ray     <br />14. What'z Ya Phone No. - Danny Ray   <br /> <br />I truly believe Tupac was one the Greatest Rapper, Lyrictist at the time of his death and still now with his death.  The sadness is he is not here to put his touch on those songs he wrote.   <br />Sure, the other great rappers but none that will compare to Tupac he was of a class of his own.  To bad there are no clean version that I am aware of.  But, at the time this would have been lost and translation of a Young Man finding his self with a world of conflict, struggles and growth.  I would encourage a person who does not have this album to go a purchase to find out the real tupac before his death.  If I could give this album a 10 stars I would.  It is Simply a Essentially Fine Piece of Art Work with Tupac Words.   <br />May he Rest In Peace-Tupac -  <br />
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I watched this movie over the Christmas holiday with various family members, and although most of us enjoyed it... your mileage may vary. I'm 39, and my son is 11. We both enjoyed the subtle humor. Just a few minutes ago, he was playing Halo2 on Xbox Live and when I heard him say \\"Stop KILLING me! GOSH!\\", I started laughing my head off.<br /><br />Depending on your background and tolerance for diversity, you may love this film... I found it fun and sort of a cult-type film that you won't forget. Much like the dialog of some goofy Jim Carrey films like \\"Ace Ventura\\" and \\"Dumb and Dumber\\", you'll remember lines from this movie and find yourself mimicking/reapeating them for no apparent reason. Alllllll-righty then.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|No one was spared in this dark satire of just about everything.  I thought I was going to burst with laughter.  At one point I wet my pants, ruptured my spleen I was laughing so hard.  Trey and Matt may very well be the next Mel Brooks, OK the next John Waters is more like it.  This is a sick, twisted, and deviant ride into hillarity.  It reminds me what the \\"Thunderbirds\\" would have been like if everyone had been really drunk and said what ever was on their minds at the time.  Celebrities, political leaders, religious leaders, americans, the military, cats, dogs, everyone gets it, NO ONE IS SPARED.  I can only imagine what an unrated director's cut would be like.  (HINT, HINT).  If you don't like vulgar or sick humor then stay away.  If you are a fan of \\"Orgazmo,\\" or \\"South Park,\\" sit down, relax and enjoy the show.
B000060MMI|5.0|These guys kick ass! My 47 year old mom who hates anything vaguely punkish even likes them. They remind me, for anyone who read English authors, of the Nac Mac Feegle in Terry Pratchetts' Wee Free Men.  <br />\\"Stealin' an drinkin' and fightin'! Nae king! Nae quin! Nae laird! Nae master! We willna be fooled again\\"
B0001UL7RY|4.0|After hearing her music for this album on the radio, as soon as it was released, I bought it. I can listen to it over and over without getting tired of it. It's a very enjoyable CD and I can listen to the whole thing without skipping songs all the time. Most of the songs are fun to sing along too and they are really cool. This album is a lot more \\"rock\\" than her other album which is probably why a lot more people like her now. Her other album was more pop, but I love both the albums.    This is what I rate the songs:    1. Take Me Away, 3 of 5 stars  2. Together, 5 of 5 stars  3. Don't Tell Me, 5 of 5 stars  4. He Wasn't, 4 of 5 stars  5. How Does it Feel, 4 of 5 stars  6. My Happy Ending, 5 of 5 stars  7. Nobody's Home, 5 of 5 stars  8. Forgotten, 4 of 5 stars  9. Freak Out, 3 of 5 stars  10. Slipped Away, 5 of 5 stars    All in all, I'd say this is an awesome album. It's pretty rare that you find an album where you love about 90% of the songs. But this is one of them. Go Avril! You're albums rock!
0783228457|2.0|Videodrome is an interesting film in that it makes absolutly no sense.<br /><br />What it is about is James Woods is the owner of a local cable network that caters mostly to porn and extreme violence.  When he finds this fettish show called Videodrome he figures he wants more so he can place it on his network.  However he soon starts to hallucinate as a signal in the videodrome has triggered a reaction in his brain that causes him to mutate.  Eventually he seeks revenge and desire to start a new race of man.<br /><br />This movie is weird enough as is but what sets it over the top is that can get exceptionally violent and even a little gory.  But it's the sexual undertones that rreally set this apart.  You see the videodrome is actually the inner desires of an individual aka sexual desires or what they really want.  IN the end though this is winds up being a messed up movie and really is only for a nitch audience.  I really can't recomend this unless you want something out there that leaves asking more questions than you should be.
B000001Y42|5.0|a lot of people say this sounds like korn. well in my opinion they sound just a bit like them. but this cd is just total PWANAGE. Every song up until after FAITH is awesome but thats when the music starts to stink. <br /> <br />ppl say that metal rap sucks but guess what: this album is like 10% rap and fred durst has so much more singing talent than other bands like slipknot. <br /> <br />this and two other lp cds are worth buying (signifigant other and the choclate star fish and hotdog flavored water) so go buy them now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005N5RM|5.0|The Blob was an entertaining, yet eventually campy classic.  The limited tools for special effects dampered the original but the story and idea was there.  Flash forward nearly 30 years later and the folks in hollywood decide to take another crack at it.  The result is an entertaining, frightening horror film that feeds to a certain extent on the strength of special effects, but also claustrophobia as well.<br /><br />The story is that a meteorite has crashed landed on earth near a small town.  An organizm on the metorite gets loose and attaches itself to a bum passing through.  As it slowly eats him it begins to grow and as it grows it starts to eat, preferably people.  Eventually it comes down to (you'll love this) a cheerleader and a local rebel to stop it.<br /><br />The reason this movie is great is for numerouse reasons.  First the movie realizes that it is campy, and uses it to it's advantage.  It also takes pop culture of that time (1980's) and pokes fun at it.  Case in point is that Slasher films were big then, so what do they do?  They make a scene with a crowded audience watching a really bad slasher film featuring a gardener in a hockey mask using a motorized Hedge Trimmer.<br /><br />The one other area I like about this is the feeling that no one is safe as is demonstrated when a young boy gets absorbed and dissolved by the blob.<br /><br />I can't praise this movie enough.  Definetly worth checking out if you want a fun campy classic horror film.
B00018D44U|4.0|This is great music to hear at the end of a long, tiring day.  <br />For casual listeners, let your ears gently rest on the simple melodious tunes and Norah's sweet voice and see how relaxed you grow as the cd progresses.  <br /> <br />To enjoy the CD even more, I'd recommend you allow yourself to feel Norah's muted passion and listen to the lyrics carefully. It will immerse you in her world, leaving you cleansed and satiated when you emerge from it.  <br /> <br />I'll rate her songs below on a scale of 1 to 5 : <br /> <br />1. Sunrise - 4/5 (An enjoyable song would sum it up) <br />2. What am I to you - 4.5/5 (This song is near-magical. Listen to the words carefully. It is romantic in a gentle, pleading way.) <br />3. Those Sweet Words - 5/5 (An awesome love song. Norah's controlled emotional rendering of the lyrics, and their perfect synchroncity with sweet, fantastic music makes this song one of the best to be released in recent years.)  <br />4. Carnival Town - 4.5/5 (This song will get 'you under its spell.' On the one hand, it conjures up pleasant childhood images of carnivals, and on the other it has wonderfully contemplative feeling. Very good Norah!) <br />5. In the Morning - 2/5 (I didn't like this song somehow. The music was jarring compared to the pleasant harmonies of the other songs, and the words had unpleasant sexual overtones, as in 'My shirt smells more of you than me'.) <br />6. Be here to love me - 4/5 (I really like the words which have a nice poetic touch. Again you can really feel Norah's passion.) <br />7. Creepin' in - 4/5 (A good song. Different from the others in the sense it is much faster. Norah demonstrates her ability to handle high notes well.)  <br />8. Toes - 2.5/5 (Compared to the other songs, this one does not really stand out in terms of lyrics or music. Rather boring as there is not much to gain from it emotionally.) <br />9. Humble Me - 4/5 (It has a nice feel to it, musically and lyrically. Norah expresses vulnerability and regret beautifully on this track.) <br />10. Above ground - 2.5/5 (An okay song.) <br />11. The long way home - 3/5 (It's an interesting song.) <br />12. The Prettiest thing - 3.5/5 (Nice.) <br />13. Don't Miss you at All - 4/5 (Again, don't miss the emotional connection this song can make with you! It's lovely.) <br /> <br />For listeners willing to go beyond the superficial 'catchiness' of a song to appreciate its depth of music and emotion, this CD is a must buy. You will find your appreciation for it only increasing with each listen. Don't miss it! <br /> <br />Note- For anyone who is overly stressed, this album is pure meditation.
B000002J1Y|5.0|They became the first band to record a triple live album of their concert, and then EMERSON LAKE AND PALMER became the second band to do the same thing.  The purpose that I read, which proves a point, was so all five band members JON ANDERSON, STEVE HOWE, CHRIS SQUIRE, RICK WAKEMAN, and new drummer ALAN WHITE who replaced BILL BRUFORD could be in solo spot on the album.  On the other hand, BILL is also in a solo spot for the drum solo on PERPETUAL CHANGE, so that actually makes six band members.  I can only assume that this song was performed live during the FRAGILE tour and not on the CLOSE TO THE EDGE tour.  However, I would have figured that the medley of LONG DISTANCE RUNAROUND/THE FISH (also featuring BILL on drums and not ALAN) would be performed live during the CLOSE TO THE EDGE tour besides the FRAGILE tour.  One way or another, it is great opportunity for BILL to able to be heard on this live album because it is a plain shame that he left to join KING CRIMSON right after the recording of CLOSE TO THE EDGE (my favorite album by YES).  The intro song (probably played on tape) is a excellent beginner, then comes the intro to SIBERIAN KHATRU that really gets the crowd off their chairs and on their feet with the rhythm and blues guitar intro, and the signature sound of the RICKENBACKER bass guitar, drums, keyboards, and vocals.  However, it is unfortunate that the SITAR guitar was not used on this song.  Next is powerful and louder version of HEART OF THE SUNRISE with the overdriven guitar riffs, louder synthesizer,  where the mellotron sounds better live than on the studio version.  As for PERPETUAL CHANGE, RICK'S tone of the HAMMOND organ throughout the song sounds better than original keyboard player TONY KAYE.  Plus, the mellotron toward the end definitely give this song a more powerful and psychodelic sound that is not heard on the studio version from THE YES ALBUM. Furthermore, the other songs from that album also sound a whole lot better on this live album.  The electric 12-string (replacing the acoustic 12-string guitar) and lap steel guitar sound excellent on AND YOU AND I, and RICK'S mellotron and moog synthesizer sound as refreshing on this live version as on the studio version, although the piano and the HAMMOND B5 organ is unfortunately missing.  The acoustic nylon guitar on MOOD FOR A DAY sounds better live than the studio version, and RICK'S composition of THE SIX WIVES OF HENRY VIII is outstanding with the various keyboards used on this song.  The harpsichord sounds excellent, but the grand STEINWAY piano delivers a more relaxing and breath-taking crystal clear sound that is a rewarding pleasure to hear.  Then comes the low-pitch moog synthesizer solo with the mellotron delivering a choir and orchestra sound in the background; however, RICK should have play the mellotron during the high-pitch moog synth solo toward the end.  Then comes the classic ROUNDABOUT that has an excellent sound, which would have been better if RICK'S HAMMOND organ sounded the same as on the studio version from FRAGILE.  However, the moog synthezer sound excellent on this version, and the high pitch harmony of bass guitarist CHRIS above JON'S lead vocal is outstanding.  On the other hand, I always thought it would be guitarist STEVE singin' the high notes, and I always wondered if either STEVE or CHRIS would sing the high notes or neither would do so.  Plus, the electric guitar that replaces the acoustic guitar sounds excellent.  Now for the second cd, I'VE SEEN ALL GOOD PEOPLE is outstanding with STEVE'S miniature acoustic guitar, the harmony vocals, and RICK'S mellotron, sounding like flutes, in place of TONY KAYE's moog synthesizer on YOUR MOVE and ALL GOOD PEOPLE played at a faster pace with STEVE's blasting guitar riffs, ALAN'S drumming, CHRIS'S bass guitar riffs and RICK'S harpischord.  LONG DISTANCE RUNAROUND that features BILL'S drumming, STEVE'S electrifying guitar riffs, CHRIS'S bass guitar and harmony vocal, amd RICK'S harpsichord is excellent, but not meant to be played at a faster pace.  The sound of CHRIS'S bass guitar on THE FISH is outstanding, but his solo is really dragging the song out.  On the other hand, RICK'S HAMMOND organ and mellotrom are excellent on this song too.  My only complaints about the next song CLOSE TO THE EDGE are the tone of both STEVE'S GIBSON ES345 STEREO and RICK'S organ that do not match the orginal studio sound.  For one thing about STEVE'S guitar, there is no overdrive (like on SIBERIAN KHATRU) on the tone of this guitar (OK for rhythm parts though, but bad for solos), and I do not know if this because of this particalur guitar or the setting of a different amp this guitar was plugged into.  On the other hand, this sound would have been no problem for I'VE SEEN ALL GOOD PEOPLE to capture the original studio guitar sound, but STEVE still should have had this problem looked into.  Meanwhile, the sitar guitar sounds excellent.  As I mentioned before, the last two songs from THE YES ALBUM titled YOURS IS NO DISGRACE and STARSHIP TROOPER have a more power sound than the original studio with RICK'S mellotron.  I love the way that STEVE'S guitar solo sounds in the middle of YOURS IS NO DISGRACE, meaning the overdriven rhythm sound and then the bluesy sound.  J0N'S singin' throughout the album sounds is rewarding to hear.  If there are any songs from the FRAGILE and CLOSE TO THE EDGE tours in 1972 that did not make it on the orginal lp, they should have been added to this reissue edition as bonus tracks.  I recommend this as a must have for all classic YES fans, and I plan to get this on DVD in the future.
B00005JN4O|5.0|but I can't.  It's that simple.  The movie is absolutely fantastic.  You'll laugh, cry, and remember your youth from long ago.  It's completely clean and completely innocent, very well-acted, and a complete joy to watch.  I LOVED this movie.
0316666343|5.0|I remember reading this book a couple years ago, and i could barely get through it the first time, i was crying so hard. It was terrible emotional. I have always been a very visual, emotional, in dept person. I've always looked at everything out of it's dictantion. Reading this book was an experience in it's self, weather, you hated the book or loved it till the very end i don't think as the reader you can deny how well written it was and what a brilliant writer Alice is. I have read many books and all different kinds, and they all have impacted my life in their own ways but none have like The lovely bones, none have made me feel so connected to a character, to her family, to her boyfriend, to her death like Susie. No book has keep me as involved and intrested. I always go back to this book. I have read it 6 times now and each time i feel different, i get a different emotion. I truely loved the book, even though the circumstances were very difficult at some points.
B00005JMUL|4.0|A lot of good reviews (positive and nagative) concerning this film.  the detractors find some good and the supporters find some flaw.  To me, that makes sense.  In a nut-shell this is a film full of \\"WOW!!\\" moments with enough flaws to make you go \\"Hmmm?\\".  I won't nitpick the story.  It's compelling enough.  Probably more danger than I'd like to see a nine-year-old face, but that's part of what makes it compelling.  What I do nit-pick is the overall \\"feal\\" of the film.  Sometimes it's spine chilling...  ... and sometimes just chilling.  Here's a list of the things that made me go \\"WOW\\" and \\"Hmmm?\\"....<br /><br />WOW!!!<br />-The overall texture of the film is mind-boggling.  I'd need to see it 20 time to appreciate every detail the artist have included.<br />-The train.  I love trains, and this depiction is just awesome.  Never watch this without, AT LEAST, a decent home theater.  the sound penetrates you.<br />-The flying ticket scene.  A great, uncut sequence.  I think I like it so much because no people are involved for most of it.<br />-The last perils before reaching the North Pole are riveting.  Unfortunately it is literally down hill from there.<br />-\\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\\" is a spine tingling moment.<br />-The overall scale of things is pretty impressive, but....<br /><br />Hmmm?<br />-Things are sometimes so big they are forboding or even down-right scary.  The Northpole is a big and scary place.<br />-The elfs are creepy.  Most have bad skin and razor stubble.  They could also use Hermee to fix there teeth.<br />-You may have heard, Santa is a bit wierd looking. All of the character move in an unatural way and the insides of their mouths are spooky and mysterious.  And then there's those lifeless eyes....<br />-This is picky, but nicely rendered as everything is, why could'nt they make the facial hair NOT look like it was glued on?<br />That bugged me throughout the film.<br />-Steven Tyler makes the scariest elf of them all.  Really out of place.<br />-Overall, the film fealt populated by zombies.  The dancing waiters were the strangest of all.<br /><br />Dispite these \\"little\\" comlaints, I'd have to advise seeing this film.  It had enough magic to make it compelling, and enough excitement to shake your nerves.  My 2 year old son (a train freek with an ear infection) made it about 3/4 through until they stopped showing the train.  Then he cried allot.  We took him out and he cried to get back in.  So, we stood on the side and held him through the last 20 minutes of the film.  The point is, scary as stuff was, he liked it and I enjoyed it too.  And forget the book.  The only thing you'll see from the book is the beginning and the end,  come to think of it, that is the book!g waiters were the strangest of all.

B00005JKNF|5.0|What I want to say about this movie it's already been said! The actors, the director, the argument! Everything, I mean everything is exceptional! It's delightfull to see all of these actors in their most splendid performances! The murder?! Doesn't make any difference! In the end - and it's only a weekend - it seems that nobody remembers the dead - Michael Gambon in a tremendous performance - It's only a diversion for the rest - Secrets, Lies... upstairs, downstairs... Not very well hidden feelings! THAT is the most important and what makes the movie so good! <br /> <br />In one simple word - Original!
B0000AQVCL|2.0|ok ill admit it.\\"cold hard b****\\" is a good song.i like it.not afraid to say so no matter how much beef i get from friends of mine.we all listen to bands like sevendust,shinedown,etc. but it doesnt bother me to branch out.the rest of the cd,other than \\"CHB\\" is just awful.i mean nothing was bearable for more than 5 seconds or so.i just couldnt swallow any of it.just not my style but \\"CHB\\" is a way cool tune.\\"are you gonna be my girl\\" is just annoying and \\"rollover dj\\" sux mega.anyways,the point is,if you want a GOOD side of jet, get \\"CHB\\" on itunes or something and keep to the positive side of things.
068987474X|5.0|I was bummed and depressed surfing the net when I found this book.  I had just come off the worst relationship of my life.  It lasted about 1 year and that was about 363 days tooooo long as I now know because it was obvious from the start that he was...you got it...just not that into me.  Greg and Liz really get it.  I spent a couple of hours reading this book cover to cover and would like to find a way to shrink it and keep it in my purse for future dates.  I found myself laughing out loud at their interpretation of the excuses I have made for guys for soooo many years.  Every single woman in the world should read this.  In fact every single guy in the world should too.  They would then know that they better get off their butts and do something about it if they are really into someone.  Liberated women don't mess around anymore!!

B0006399FS|1.0|First off, I have never been a U2 fan.  However, when I heard vertigo, I thought I would give this album a try.  After putting it into my car cd player though, I almost died in a car accident because the album bored me to sleep.  Honestly, this album is downright boring.  The lyrics are putrid, and the music sounds like they ripped off their other albums.  If you are a fan, stay away from this turd.  It may offend you so badly that you will be forced to end your existence.
0064407667|5.0|RARE it is these days to find classic literature being born right before our very eyes, but this mysterious author known as Lemony Snicket is one such superb author.<br /><br />With a name so persnickerdy, the reader is forewarned that the tale inside the books may prove to be too fearful for younguns.<br /><br />But - that is far from the case - I read this book with my 9 year old son, and it proved to be highly entertaining and very good for his reading skills which are already pretty impressive.<br /><br />Violet, Klaus and Sunny are 3 chillens born into real bad luck and lots of bad stuff happen to them in the book. Besides the biggie of their parents dying in a mysterious fire, they are forced to live with their terrible uncle, Count Olaf, who is a real terror and he's super mean.<br /><br />It gets even edgier when the Count demands that 14 year old virgin Violet marry him so that he can get his miserable hands on the Children's fortune...this is a ghastly plot twist that reeks of pedophilia or incest, but then again,<br /><br />the Brothers Grimm made that an essential ingredient to their story telling formulas.<br /><br />No - Violet is saved in the end by clever Klaus and the happy ending shows Count being arrested and chased far away.<br /><br />The enduring lesson here is that the three siblings strongly have learned to help one another and were able to creatively problem-solve when the going got very very rough.<br /><br />It's a wonderful lesson to prove, that one is never defeated when united with hearts filled with love.<br /><br />I am energized to continue reading the entire modern literary library of this amazing author, Lemony Snicket.<br /><br />Or at least, I have bought the first three books and plan on reading together with my 9 year old....it's fun and it's<br /><br />entertaining and much has been learned by reading this modern tale of plots that entertained people for many, many years.<br /><br />Read this book and see if it doesn't work for you.<br /><br />The warnings are just silly fun from the author - - - he warns that the book is unpleasant, but it's a fun book to read - honest!<br /><br />Good literature in times where American Literature is somewhat sparse to find./>The warnings are just silly fun from the author - - - he warns that the book is unpleasant, but it's a fun book to read - honest! <br />Good literature in times where American Literature is somewhat sparse to find.
B000067CPX|4.0|Let's start things off with a moment of silence.  The Chili Peppers of old have passed away and a new era has begun.  Get over it.  Would you enjoy rehashing yourselves for 20 years constantly playing the same funky rock.  If you are an artist then you will respond with a resounding no.  These guys are artists.  Even in their 80's and early 90's period these guys were constantly being creative and breaking the mold.  They've done it all.  They've made aggressive funk and beautiful ballads and every crazy idea in between.  This album marks a new direction but not a direction they are going straight into.  This is as laid back as I think you will ever here the Chili Peppers and is a perfect chill out album.  Read on for my review of By The Way. <br /> <br />1.By The Way-In the context of this album, it sounds like this song was written during the Californication period.  With a funky bassline and pounding toms, one might be fooled into thinking that they are in for an adrenaline rush of an album.  The one thing this excellent song lacks in is the bridge where Flea should have pulled out an awesome bass solo (Check out Live At Slane and Hyde Park for this) <br />2.Universally Speaking-Pop??  This is totally unlike anything the Chilis have done.  The song is mostly monotonous and generally non memorable.  The songs beat actually creates a problem for it as I have found that if the song was sped up, it would actually rock out quite well.  The solo at the end is relatively weak and uninspired.  I give this song two thumbs down. <br />3.This Is The Place-Haunting song with a cool bass lick outta Flea.  I personally like the effect that John's using on his guitar as it only adds to the haunting effect of the song.  Good rocking song. <br />4.Dosed-Some good ole laid back balladry.  This song is real calm and has a very powerful chorus.  The bridge would have been improved by means of putting a huge solo in where it is set up.  Listen to the song and you will notice that itjust builds and builds then stops.  The solo in the outro though is quite memorable and somewhat addictive. <br />5.Don't Forget Me-John's Satriani inspired fingertapping and guitar work are beautifully layered against Flea's power chords.  This is one of the few songs where John really freaks out and pulls out some great licks and solos.  The chorus is most excellent. <br />6.The Zephyr Song-Real laid back again and the second single released.  John's solo is pretty cool and it's quite interesting to hear him screaming in the bridge.  Flea's light basslines interlock beautifully with John's licks throughout. <br />7.Can't Stop-The old Chilis may be dead but taht doesn't mean that they still can't make songs in the vein of the old skool Chilis.  This is a funky rocker and my personal favorite on the album.  John gets a cool solo in the bridge and this is overall the most upbeat song on the album. <br />8.-9.I Could Die For You/Midnight-These songs are kind of like twins in that they are drastically similar and placed right next to each other.  I Could Die For You floats on some simplistic minimalist guitar playing from John and a cool bridge that segues into Midnight.  Midnight opens with cellos and other string arrangements and slowly builds to the highly addictive chorus.  The song is repetitive but memorable. <br />10.Throw Away Your Television-I was starting to think Flea was dead then I heard this song.  Flea's throbbing basslines and Chad's pounding toms make this song's jungle beat rock out.  I especially enjoy the bridge in which John goes into an insane wahwah induced solo at speeds that were not seen on the album until that point.  The song fails though with a lack of an outro where they should have thrown in the outro they use live which simply rocks out. <br />11.Cabron-Latin influence anyone?  Does anyone else see this?  It's a cool song though, very addictive.  Cool guitar licks overall courtesy of John. <br />12.Tear-Beach Boys inspired Balladry.  Thesong is relatively downbeat and sad and has a consistent string and keyboard arrangement in the backround.  The chorus is very powerful and moving and i personally like the solo John gets before the second chorus as its simplicity seems to make it utterly excellent.  John's hammeron-palooza during the bridge is equally cool as well as hearing horns right at the end of the bridge. <br />13.On Mercury-Ska influenced rocker with some good speed.  This is a fun song that sounds as though it was ripped from the Freaky Styley sessions back in '84.  Cool song overall. <br />14.Minor Thing-Nice laid back rocker with an excellent short solo in the bridge.  Has the only slap bass heard on the entire album.  The outro is beautiful with its light solo and symphonic arrangements. <br />15.Warm Tape-Boring <br />16.Venice Queen-The first truly epic song ever written by the Chilis.  This song moves through three distinctly different moods in its 6 minutes.  It starts with some soft balladry with some cool guitar licks then stops at about 2 minutes and segues into a class rock sounding acoustic riff which changes about a minute later into a more streamlined acoustic riff that finishes out the remainging 3 or so minutes. <br /> <br />Overall this is a beautiful album and a collage of great moments <br /> <br /> <br />
B00006AW2J|5.0|(My review scale: 1-Bad 2-Average 3-Good 4-Very Good 5-Excellent/Classic)      Beggars Banquet is the best Stones album.  Not by a wide margin, but it is the best.  That says a lot when you consider the other albums of the same era.      After the questionable artistic merit of the two previous studio efforts, Between the Buttons and Their Satanic Majesty's Request, the Stones began a five-year run of studio albums virtually unmatched in rock.  Following BB would be Let it Bleed, Sticky Fingers, and Exile on Main Street, not to mention the wonderful live document, Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!      Banquet would begin the era of the classic Stones of legendary status.  The Stones would abandon psychodelia, and return to roots-rock, distancing themselves from the Beatles comparisons.    By this point, Brian Jones was not a factor in the recording.  His drug habit had escalated to the point that he was unable to play, and Keith and Mick didn't want to have anything to do with him.  He would show up in the studio from time to time during sessions, usually carrying some odd instrument he had purchased, and would want to play it on the album.  This was normally nixed by Mick and Keith.  To be honest, the only song that Jones makes much of an appearance on is \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\".  Many think Jones was a big part of BB, but he was not.      This album mixed anthems like \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" and \\"Street Fighting Man\\" along with roots rockers \\"Parachute Woman\\", \\"Jig Saw Puzzle\\", \\"No Expectations\\" and the country influenced tunes, \\"Dear Doctor\\", \\"Prodigal Son\\", & \\"Factory Girl\\".  Along the way you get the unusual \\"Salt of the Earth\\" which features Mick and Keith sharing vocals.  Then there's the blues classic, \\"Stray Cat Blues\\".  An absolutely brilliant tune, and you will have to admit, the song rocks harder than any song in the history of rock, no matter what the gerne is!  There's not a single bad minute on this album.      Banquet would influence countless bands, and arguably sent the Beatles back to minimalist rock after their Sgt. Pepper classic.  It did mark the end of Brian Jones as a Stone as well.  Jones would die during the recording of Let it Bleed, but had already been ousted from any recording at the time LIB was being recorded, to be replaced with Mick Taylor.      Beggars Banquet comes in at #5 on my list of favorite records.  You can't go wrong with this one!
0385504209|2.0|This is a pretty formulaic page turner, a fun quick read. Written at about the level of the average Nancy Drew mystery, it is best appreciated at that level. As far as the content, there are howlers on virtually every page (starting with the hero who looks like \\"Harrison Ford in Harris tweed\\" and is a \\"Professor of Religious Symbology at Harvard\\" -- good work if you can find it). You have to ignore very pulpy, cheesy writing to enjoy this romantic thriller.<br /><br />Intended as a book that a dedicated reader could finish in a day, or something you take to the beach and casually finish in a weekend, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" makes for a reasonable airline novel, so much so that it is often a bit clunky in its desire to ensure that no intellectual effort on the reader's part will be required. Here's a recurring example in this novel: a bit of unfamiliar terminology, say \\"crux gemmata\\" (jeweled cross) will will be explained on page N, then on page N+1, a character will finger his jeweled cross and explain, \\"Oh, yes -- this is a crux gemmata.\\" I've read dinner menus that were more demanding on the reader. My wife and I both read about a third of it in a day, sharing the same copy, and that's a full work day plus taking care of kids, bedtime, etc. That's also a kind of virtue, I guess -- it's fast and peppy.<br /><br />As far as history goes, Dan Brown apparently thinks that \\"most historians\\" give credence to the forgeries and frauds promoted in hoary best-sellers like \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail.\\" This author gets the best of both worlds: simultaneously claiming that \\"it's just fiction,\\" while introducing the novel with claims that the historical record contained within is \\"fact.\\" That claim is ridiculous. To pluck a random example, he spends some time talking about the Council of Nicaea, and incorrectly summarizes it as the origin of the doctrine of Christ's divinity by Constantine. He ignores the Arian controversy out of which it arose, which is like trying to explain the Treaty of Versailles without mentioning World War I. He ignores the documented fact, agreed upon even by the cheerleaders of the gnostics that he is sympathetic to, that the earliest gnostic doctrines held that Christ was *purely* God, and not really man -- the very reverse of the doctrine that serves as the lynchpin of his novel's intellectual base (such as it is). This is a bad novel for weak or misinformed Christians, but anyone familiar with history should spot the train wreck of Brown's ideas a mile off.<br /><br />Oh yes, and in Brown's world, Opus Dei has shadowy assassin \\"monks\\" (in real life, Opus Dei is not a monastic order -- there are no Opus Dei monks, let alone trained assassins), and the Catholic Church has been promulgating known lies as its central dogmas, promotes violence throughout the world, and has been retarding the progress of science and knowledge for 2 millennia. Brown leaves the reader with the impression that this, too, is a matter of settled historical record. Oh, but then again, it's just fiction. Except when it's not.<br /><br />In general, if you're looking for a heady thriller wrapped around Christian arcana, I'd recommend Umberto Eco's excellent \\"Name of the Rose,\\" not this dumbed down, by-the-numbers novel.Treaty of Versailles without mentioning World War I.

0195067142|5.0|I finally got around to reading this wonderful book.  Like many others, I was lead to it by Paul Fussell's \\"Wartime.\\"<br /><br />I have gained a new appreciation for the history of the Pacific campaign and will undoubtedly read more.<br /><br />Sledge's account is a little tedious at times as he makes an effort to nail down historical details of troop deployments, which are important but not particularly interesting to the average reader, but it hardly detracts from the impact of the book.<br /><br />If an expanded edition of this book were published with better maps and perhaps an expanded introduction by an historian I would surely buy it.  Fussell's introduction explains a little bit about how Sledge actually managed to keep notes in combat, which I found interesting and would like to know more about.
B00005JN0T|2.0|The only reason to watch this movie is the spectacular CGI.  The combining of real actors (if you can call Will Smith a real actor) with CG looks terrific.  But the plot is SERIOUSLY lacking... <br /> <br />There are so many plot holes in this flick, I don't know where to begin.  Was there any doubt after 10 minutes who the real culprit was?  Once again, Hollywood's disdain for the \\"evil corporation\\" rings loud.   <br /> <br />During the big robot attack on Smith in his car, does anybody really believe that there isn't another car on the road?  In L.A.?? LOL! <br /> <br />It just goes on and on.  What a terrible, mindless flick.
B0000A2ZO1|3.0|A Reman raised clone of a young Picard conquers Romulas and seeks to capture his unknowing genetic contributor to complete a DNA transfer that would save him from cellular break down and death but kill Picard. <br /> <br />This would have made a better Star Trek: The Next Generation two parter episode but has some nice Trek moments (Riker and Troi marry, Data finds a \\"brother\\"). On par with \\"Star Trek: Insurrection\\" not \\"Star Trek: First Contact\\" as far as quality.  Unfortunately it's the fact that it would have made a better series entry than a movie that weighs it down.  Not really well thought out, predictable except for the end and unfortunately it's a \\"what the @&#% were they thinking!?\\" as opposed to a \\"Wow!\\" ending.   <br /> <br />Mostly disappointing ending to an over a decade long STTNG love affair.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I like this movie mainly because I recognized way too many of the characters. A Napolean Dynamite went to every one of our schools. The nerdy guy who unlike the rest of the nerds wasn't smart. The poor kid who over compensated by glorifying the truly horrid.  <br /> <br />You know his brother. The hundred pound weakling who constantly claims to be working out and takes martial arts classes yet still gets beat down every day.  <br /> <br />And you know the uncle. The ex-highschool jock who wasn't all that great to start with but still finds his high school athletic days to be the high point of his wretched existence. <br /> <br />There are definitely many movies I have laughed harder through, but the parts I found funny I found funny on an unusuall level. I don't know if this movie is a must own, but it is definitely a must see.
0440237688|1.0|There is a lot of excitement about this book.  I read it before my daughter, and man was I glad I did.  This is an intersting, read, but for kids over 14.  I believe the subject of murdering babies is not appropriate, not matter what, for pre-teens.  The book is too dark for young kids.  There are many parts of the story that are wonderful and thought provoking, but it just goes too far for kids.  Call me a prude, but what my kids read IS important -- I urge you, as a parent to read it first to see if you agree.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I can see that most of the reviews on this page are from tween/teeny bopper Britney haters who have probably never heard the album nor understand the content. (On a side note: the comment \\"all she is good for is giving head\\" is pretty ridiculous and irrelevant to an album review.) <br /> <br />I'm not a big fan of pop music, but I really like this CD. It's very sexy. One of the biggest complaints people have had about it is the song \\"Touch of my Hand\\" because of the subject matter. To me, it's just a double standard and I think it's cool that she didn't take the song off the album, plus it's just a sexy song. I also like \\"Everytime\\", \\"Me Against the Music\\", and \\"Early Mornin'\\". <br /> <br />If you're looking for a serious CD, I wouldn't pick this up. But if you're looking for something to dance to or just a fun CD, I recommend it whether you like Britney or not.
B00000K413|4.0|if your a serious collector of tff's works and have no copy of the original release, then by all means buy this one. not only it has clearer sound, it has 4 bonus tracks as well. <br /> <br />as for me, i have all tff albums in cassette (first, because no cd yet then) and on cd as well. i have the original release version and they sound just as good as they should. if you're somewhat a purist like me, you'll settle for the old and a bit bland stereo sound. otherwise, if you're a techno purveyor, then the remastered one is just for you. enjoy!!!
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|TROY was a magnificently done motion picture, kudos must be given to Wolfgang Peterson for his use of creativity and talent within such a film. It was thought for a long time that a movie that depicted the classic of Homer's &quot;Iliad&quot; would be impossible. And granted a few attempts were made, due to the nature of the book and the history behind it(Being one of the oldest and longest standing epics based upon the modern day idea of Heroism)it would be impossible for everyone to love. And within this story, Wolfgang tells the tale of the mortal aspect of the Trojan War. He does this not only for the reason of the impossiblity of explaining the god's to those who were not familiar with Greek History, but also to simply cut the movie down to a good 2.5 hours. The story centered around Achilles, and truly shows the growth of a Hero and the impact it has on all those around him. It is reflective of the &quot;Iliad&quot; not in the direct story-telling but in the feelings and the story of growth that Homer was attempting to portray. The movie captured very well the image that Homer was trying to paint. Even though you own a copy of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; and your copy was not painted by Da Vinci, the painting still has the same lasting effect on you. This film was a romantic and beautiful re-telling of the classic of Homer's wonderful epic poem. And in that way TROY is a tremendious success.

B0006SSOHM|5.0|i saw this movie as soon as it came out and it was worth every penny i paid to see it. this is definitly one of the best suspense/horror films i have seen in a long time. i have not felt fear like this since watching horror flicks as a child. this is a great movie and i recommend for everyone to watch it, put it on for your friends,invite your family.this movie is definitly going down in history as one of the best thought out films ever. the gore is beautifully done. horror and gore fans this is really THE ONE to see!!!!!!!!!!!!a must have for any horror fans dvd collection.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is the most amazing cast recording I own. Buy this! I suggest \\"What is this Feeling,\\" \\"Popular,\\" and \\"Defying Gravity.\\" <br /> <br />Enjoy this awesome cd!
0762412992|1.0|I bought this book to replace my old copy that was lost during a recent move. The book is finely illustrated but the narrative is so full of gaping wounds that the entire charm of the story is lost. I should have searched a little harder for a COMPLETE version.
B00006ZXSK|4.0|This is a great movie! Like someone else has said, dont even bother renting this movie. JUST GO OUT AND BUY IT. Drew Barrymore does an excellent job as the repressed and trod upon Daniella also known as 'Cinder Girl' or Cinderella by her stepsister. What I loved about this movie was that Cinderella did not have to be saved by the prince, rather she saved herself. She is a gutsy, tough, clever and intelligent character who is still a sensitive girl because of her experiences in life. <br />Dougray Scott as the Prince performs his role of childish spoilt rich brat who grows in his love(for Danielle as well as in maturity) with aplomb. Parts of the movie where he spouts romance with utter sincerity such as when he tells Danielle upon her enquiry that did she not already know his weakness for wasnt it obvious? That should have sounded soppy(for a hardened jaded cynic like me) but it didnt! <br />Anjelica H(o)uston as the stepmother is just too good. I can go on and on about this movie but I will conclude by saying that this movie is a perfect mix of romance, drama, action, comedy(Danielle rescuing the Prince from the gypsies) and history(Leonardo Da Vinci!! as well as the fact that many think that the idea of the glass slipper was a misinterpretation where while in translation from French to English the original material fur was mistaken for glass) and just because it is different in so many ways(the second sister sympathizing with Danielle). <br />Watch it when you are feeling down, just like that, when you have the girls over, when you have people over and to give young girls everywhere who love Cinderella a more truthful version of the story as opposed to the rather pathetic wimp that exists in the more popular Disney version of the fairy tale.
B0000541AM|5.0|I don't write to many positive reviews about much because I try to prevent people from making my same mistakes. But trust me when I and everyone else agrees that this is a great movie. I don't need to go into detail just look at all the positive reviews. All of us can't/are not wrong. Trust me !!!
B00005YW4H|4.0|I first got knocked outta my socks when I saw Norah on, of all things, a Willie Nelson special.  She is special and unique and does not have to be compared to anyone else.  This is an award-winning CD for good cause. Pay no attention to those who give it a one- or two-star review.  I looked of some of those hahnyaks' other reviews.  One self-gratifier seems to give 90% bad reviews to all pieces of music (jealousy?), another thinks Britney is the best in any field of music (I wonder if he shaves yet),yet another is a Steely Dan freak, and on and on.  All those positive voters can't be wrong.  Ignore the virgin naysayers and add this work to your collections. Now!
B00006AG5N|4.0|This album represents the cream of Elvis's career. I am disappointed though with the sound quality of this cd and there are two alternative takes (The Wonder Of You) and (A Fool Such As I) that are not as good as the originals. Still for a complete album of classics and for fans new to his music, this is a good place to start.
B00005JNLY|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by \\"Spanglish\\" and found myself enjoying it a lot more than I thought I would. I would actually rate it 3 out of 5 stars if it weren't for the top-notch performance by Paz Vega, who IMO steals the show. By playing a maid, her role unfortunately does not break away from the stereotypical Hollywood role for a Latina actress. However, she is given so much screen time in this movie that she has every chance to breathe life into it, which she does in every scene she is in. And what's even better, having her take center stage lets her avoid getting swallowed up by the starpower of Adam Sandler, Tea Leoni and Cloris Leachman. Although I agree with other reviewers that this movie focuses a lot (perhaps even too much) on Deborah's neurosis, I think Flor is the one whom this movie is really about. After all, the movie is narrated from the first-person viewpoint of Flor's daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce) who mainly talks about her mother's experiences with the family. <br /> <br />In terms of the other performances, everyone does a credible job. Adam Sandler proves that he can take on a more serious role, although there were certain scenes when I almost expected him to suddenly go slapstick on us. The only scene that I found pointless is when Tea Leoni climaxes on top of Sandler with her clothes on. This scene was majorly out of place in the movie and was rather stupid and unfunny. <br /> <br />All in all, \\"Spanglish\\" is a movie that would be fairly run-of-the-mill if it weren't for the injected Latin flavor of Paz Vega, who spices things up and makes it worth seeing. This is her first major blockbuster movie in the American market, and now that she has gotten the exposure she needs, I hope she can continue to have success with her future projects.
0312263120|3.0|I was baffled to see the relatively low ratings for Digital Fortress; I've read Angels & Demons and The Da Vinci Code, and thoroughly enjoyed both of them.  It would follow that Digital Fortress would be just as good, right? <br /> <br />Not so fast. <br /> <br />The book was well written, but the book just didn't grab me like the other two.  The plot seemed dull, comparatively.  The characters seemed flat, more like cardboard cutouts than like the vivid characters of Dan Brown's other novels. <br /> <br />The ending was predictable. <br /> <br />I was not overly impressed, but I wasn't bored with it either.  I'm glad I bought the paperback rather than a hardback edition.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|I am not a fan of horror movies, especially not zombie movies, but \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is not the ordinary zombie movie despite the fact that it is full of realistic-looking zombies.<br /><br />The humor comes primarily from the main, live characters, who are like British sitcom characters whose lives irritatingly get interrupted by flesh-eating zombies.  I loved how Shaun doesn't even notice them at first--a comment about people who live their lives half asleep.  Shaun doesn't even watch the news.  When he does notice them, he is not all that afraid of them, and simply bashes them over the head with his cricket bat.<br /><br />So, I think if you love zombie movies, you'll love \\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" and if you hate zombie movies, you'll love \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" as it's so fun to watch--and not really that gory, except for one brief scene.
B00005JMAH|2.0|Too much book, not enough movie. Too many holes in movie. <br />The book is too big ( twice as big as book 1 or book 2 ) to make a movie out of. I did like it for what it was,and that really was'nt very much, too much of the book was left out, but I've read the book and the movie leaves me wanting more. Just not enough time to make the movie half as good as the other 2 movies were. An extra Hour would not have hurt but 2 would have been better. <br />I suggest see movie first so you won't be too disappointed. <br />I can't see how book 4 or book 5 can be made into movies that will be worth seeing.
B000000H3Z|5.0|This record is easily in the top five metal (not just thrash) albums of all time, it really is that good. Sepultura had other good releases, such as Arise, but they never topped BTR. I like my thrash metal fast, and this record unapologetically delivers insane speed on every song. Crushing guitar riffs mixed with just enough melody and amazing solo work are evident on every song. The speed-picked passages near the end of Inner Self and especially Primitive Future just destroy you and show some orginality from other thrash acts. I especially like how Andreas Kisser avoids the atonal soloing and Max Cavalera avoids satanic themes, both of which are found in many Slayer releases. No filler material here either - every track is either good or great. Personal favorites are Stronger than Hate, Slaves of Pain, Hungry, & Primitive Future.
B00005JN2Z|2.0|I'm not sure why Jaime Foxx is receiving such great accolades for Collateral, when in fact Tom Cruise is the scene stealer in this film. Cruise plays his most vicious character to date as a hitman with absolutely no conscience. The best scene of Collateral has to be when Vincent's briefcase is jacked from Max's (Foxx) cab by a couple of street punks. Vincent just strolls out in time to see the kids walking off with his possession. He approaches them and has a gun put to his head, but in a split second the two young men are dead and Vincent has his briefcase back. Michael Mann tries way too hard to delve deep into character development for Max and Vincent when in fact all the audience really wants is to get an inside glimpse of Vincent's facinating lifestyle. The movie is about a half hour too long and the ending seems as if it was rewritten at least a half dozen times. The ultimate payoff in this film is certainly not worth the ride. Overall, Collateral is a marked step back for Michael Mann but a great expansion of range for Cruise. Recommended only to hardcore Cruise fans only.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Real is the best word to describe The World at War.  This is real people telling real stories of events that happened and the atmosphere surrounding those events.  This is not a biased compilation like most television specials or documentaries that have limited interviews and instead are dominated by a single narrator.  In addition Laurence Oliver, the narrator for War of the Worlds, does a great job and does not sound like he is reading a stuffy old history book in the background.  I enjoy history but unfortunately do not find myself interested in sitting and watching a documentary in my down time but once I saw one of the clips of this set I was hooked.  This set was billed as \\"the definitive history of World War II.\\"  It is a must have for any history buff and I would highly recommend it for those who think history is boring.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|First off, let me set something straight. Pink Floyd Live at Pompeii is \\"live\\" in the loosest sense of the word. What much of the running time of this film consists of is Pink Floyd playing to an empty relic of a coliseum, there is no audience (aside from the viewer and a few sound techs). The track selection is utterly amazing and the execution is flawless: Echoes Parts I and II open and close the film and are undoubtedly the highlights of Live at Pompeii. The remaining tracks are some of Floyd's most challenging material such as Careful With That Axe, Eugene, Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun and Saucerful of Secrets. All of these tracks are interspersed with gorgeous landscapes and computer animation. But the real treat is being able to watch Waters, Gilmour, Wright and Mason flow off of each other's energy during performance. One of these Days is pulled off flawlessly with Gilmour's guitar wailing over Wright's pulsating keyboards. What really fascinated me about Live at Pompeii was the look inside the studio as Floyd was recording The Dark Side of the Moon. Just being able to watch David Gilmour solo over an unfinished Brain Damage should be reason enough for you to own this DVD. The interviews throughout the film have caught the band usually while eating. Waters is still content to be a jerk most of the time by mocking the director or the interviewers questions. Nick Mason has some prophetic words concerning the inner relations of the band which would eventually erode to nothing. Overall, this is a must own for any Pink Floyd fan and a fine addition to any classic rock fan's DVD collection.
0792846443|4.0|There are only a handful of Stephen King movies that I believe actually did the books justice (i.e. The Shining, Christine, Carrie). A lot of the film adaptations were just okay (i.e. Cujo, Pet Semetary, Thinner) and some just plain sucked (i.e. It, The Tommyknockers or probably The Stand, which I never bothered seeing). Misery fits snug into the first category. I saw this film some years ago when I was younger and I remembered liking it. I got the DVD as a Christmas present recently. I was pleased initially, but even more pleased after I watched it. I don't think I was old enough when I watched it the first time to really appreciate this film. The film's suspenseful and taut atomosphere was, to me, reminiscent of something Hitchcock might have came up with. My heart was racing pretty much this entire movie until it was over. I really liked the film's feeling of isolation with a complete psycho. Really worked well. And I don't think any of it was possible without James Caan and Kathy Bates. They play off their characters finely and memorably. A fine addition to the collection.
B00005JN0T|4.0|I haven't read any Isaac Asimov yet, however I know some of his stories, since I've seen three movies based on his books.  From this, I have decided that much Anime (Japanese animation) was inspired by the works of Asimov.  As this may or may not imply, I, Robot does have moments where, if it weren't the fact that it were live action, I could see it coming out of the minds of the greatest Japanese story tellers, although I know better.  This is an action movie which, gasp, actually has a plot.<br /><br />Will Smith plays a cop who has had past, unpleasant run ins with robots, and thus has some degree of paranoia surrounding them.  Soon his paranoia proves correct as he is 'attacked' by a rogue robot who has begun to take on elements of a soul.  The robot, named Sonny, becomes one of many clues leading Smith's character to the true threat presented toward humanity.<br /><br />I found this movie to be surprisingly good for an action movie, with well developed characters and some nice action scenes.  Although not as spectacular as the Matrix Trilogy (especially Reloaded), I, Robot is high above most other movies of its kind.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|The album proves two things about Ms. Keys;she's in a talented class of her own and she demands your attention. When I first heard this album on AOL, I was well, BORED! I had never heard her first debut, which a a litle to over-hyped, so I was expecting for something to grab me. So with this, \\"The Diary Of ALicia Keys\\" is an album in which you must sit down, tune out your troubles and listen to what she is singing about. If you are use to being hypnotized by todays banging beats , songs like 'Dragon Days' may leave you thinking \\"why is this child singing about dragons\\"...or similiar sounds in songs like \\"When You Really Love someone\\" and \\"If I Was Your Woman\\" may bore you! <br /> <br />That is what seperates this album from the other comtemporary fluff of today...it is not so much of her lyrics that are great becasue if you really listen they are no different from Beyonce's but it is the real music, emotion in her voice that makes this album great. She stays true to her roots while still being modern on tracks like \\"Heartburn\\" and \\"Karma\\"......the only downfall to this album is the same structure it has of her first effort, THE SAME EXACT STRUCTURE...it is almost like Ms. Keys tried to write songs according to her last album's tracklist..but it ends up still sounding fresh! <br /> <br />This album is enjoyable, but if you don't understand and appreciate the concept of real sounds then you'll want your money back!
B0001ZX0OW|2.0|I came to this movie expecting to be deeply affected, but came away shaking my head in disbelief.  The fact that Sean Penn (who gives a performance that is so over-the-top that it's actually somewhat amusing), and Tim Robbins (who has made a career out of being overrated) won Oscars for this piece of manipulative hackwork is downright surreal.  Think a two-hour episode of \\"Law & Order\\".  Or maybe \\"Kojack\\".
B000002U9W|5.0|This album is one of Pink Floyds greatest albums, I started listening to it when I already was into PF and had listen to them for a couple of months. <br /> <br />1. Atom heart mother: <br />a). Fathers shout 5/5: <br /> The introducing part, some orchestra making som unrythmic noices, suddenly the drums kick in and the orchestra play the wonderful main theme, a sound of a horses draging a wagon plus som whipping followed by a motorcykle starting makes an maks you exited by the rest of this odd and beautiful song <br />b). Breast Milky 5/5: <br /> An duo of organ and viola, beatiful, followed by Gilmours slideing guitar solos, truley very enjoyeble <br />c). Mothers Fore 5/5: <br /> Drums, organ and solo singing by a women, very beautiful and very typical PF-organ <br />d). Funky Dung 5/5: <br /> Very nice part with as the title describes it \\"funky\\" guitar and bass playing <br />e). Mind Your Throats Please 4/5: <br /> A very wierd and experimental part of the suite, it builds up a tension and makes you love the last part <br />f). Remergence 5+/5: <br /> The wonderful last part. When the electronic voice says \\"Silance in the Studio\\" and the main theme plays, you just can't help but smile and feel your skin revel. Later the choir does the main theme wich is very majestecly and nice. The last chord in the song is very strong and about 50% louder then anything else in the song, very cool and good ending. <br /> <br />Conclution: The title track is a true masterpice you woun't get bored with for a long time Total score: 5/5 <br /> <br />2. If <br /> Nice acoustic song, very good lyrics, though I the hoarse singing can sometimes become kind of anoying, but the rest of the song overshines that, so I'll give it a: 4/5 <br /> <br />3. Summer 68 <br /> Nice and beautiful all the way, the main theme in this song is kind of cool and makes you want to dance, 5/5! <br /> <br />4. Fat old sun <br /> Very beutiful, but in a more kind of drifting and relaxing way the track 3, andI give it a 5/5 <br /> <br />5. Alans Psychedelic Breakfast <br /> This song is a very funny one, the kitchen noices seems more laugheble every time you here it, however its kind of long, and you may get disturbed by the Psychedelic mumbeling and splating chewing sounds. But I really like it, I give it a 4/5 <br /> <br />The album in it's entirety: <br />This is a very good PF ablum, as you can see not a rating under 4, and if you have listen to their faumous album such as DSOTM, WYWH and The Wall, this album wount sound bad in your ears if you give it a chance
B000002BFZ|5.0|Pearl Jam were really listening to the river on this one! this is so much better than Ten! Off He Goes is beautiful & Present Tense is so touching.  In My Tree is amazing and youll never hear a song with a better drum beat!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Meet Napolean Dynamite. He's a nerd extraordinaire, complete with bad hair, glasses, and an all-round dysfunctional life at high school. He spends his days drawing pictures of monsters and warriors, working in the FFA, hoarding tater tots in his pants, and obessing over his Chapstick. He's living at home with his brother (training to be a cage fighter and talks to hot chicks over the Internet), and his grandmother and her pet llama Tina. If he's got any great ambition or goal in life, you can't tell what it is. <br /> <br />Then the bottom falls out, and his shady Uncle Rico moves in. Uncle Rico engages in various money-making ventures and relives his supposed football glory days. At the same time, Napolean befriends a new kid in school, Pedro, and helps him run for class president. <br /> <br />You just have to have a certain sense of humor for \\"Napolean Dynamite.\\" Yes, it's slow, the camera work is pretty static, and it makes no sense often. But, on the other hand, when it drops a line, it makes it count! And Jon Heder has such a great style delivering these lines. (\\"Come on, Tina, eat your ham!\\" is one of my favorites. <br /> <br />Yes, it's lame, but you'll laugh out loud!
B000002BYD|5.0|Want to know why? listen to this album! it came out in 1998 and shows that Pearl Jam was still the best band in the world ever since 91!
B0001KZM3O|3.0|By the time \\"The Wall\\" was released in 1979, Pink Floyd, for better or for worse, was firmly within the creative control of bassist/vocalist/imperious principal songwriter Roger Waters, and as such were not much more than his own backing musicians, with their musical aspirations clearly relegated to afterthought status in comparison to those of Waters.<br /><br />When it worked (as it did the \\"Animals\\" and \\"The Wall\\"), the results were spectacular.  When it did NOT work (as with \\"The Final Cut\\" and pretty much every solo album Roger Waters has released since separating from Pink Floyd), AT BEST Waters' efforts are strictly hit-and-miss.<br /><br />\\"The Final Cut\\" is, firstly, largely made up of songs that were intially culled from \\"The Wall\\".  It is obvious by listening to the songs, either from the lyrics or the sound effects included with the recordings (the dog tags, the TV stations consistently changing)...\\"The Postwar Dream\\", \\"When The Tigers Broke Free\\" (actually written for and appearing in the movie \\"Pink Floyd The Wall\\", it would be more at home on \\"The Wall\\", but as it is one of the most touching songs Waters has ever written, I am just thankful that it has finally been released on anything save a \\"Best Of\\" compilation), and \\"The Final Cut\\" are the songs most obviously missing from \\"The Wall\\" that make up some of the stronger efforts from this album.<br /><br />And that's the problem.  Guitarist David Gilmour's argument against releasing them was pretty simple; if they weren't good enough to release in 1979, what made them good enough to release in 1983?  The answer, unfortunately, is that the rest of the material on this album -while unquestionably dear to Waters' heart- simply isn't that strong.  And by shutting out the contributions of Gilmour, keyboardist Rick Wright (sacked before recording even began), and drummer Nick Mason (sacked before the album could be completed), Waters essentially released \\"The Final Cut\\" as his first solo album; the strongest effort, \\"Not Now John\\", is also the one track where Gilmour's influence is felt the most.<br /><br />Ultimately, the reason this album failed to resonate despite the terrific production values (almost anything Michael Kamen lends his name to is quality work; his efforts here are no exception) lies not with the artist's presentation but with his vision; it is a far more personal album that the listener, unless he or she is a socially disenfranchised British liberal rock star who has lost a parent to a war and whose family is in a state of disarray of its own, PROBABLY isn't going to be able to relate to regardless of how well the songwriting (which is subpar for Pink Floyd but not resoundingly poor) or production (which is amazing; this is a magnificent CD to listen to with headphones; a SACD/DTS 5:1 version of this, like any Pink Floyd album, would be extremely well-received).<br /><br />And the tone of the album is just SO depressing.  In a lot of ways it can be compared, both in its hodgepodge/piecemeal composition AS WELL AS knowing that its creators were falling apart as it was being recorded, with the Beatles' \\"Let It Be\\".  But even \\"Let It Be\\" had some uplifting moments...\\"The Final Cut\\" begins with a lamentation that a father's ultimate sacrifice \\"for King and Country\\" was in vain with the subsequent direction the country has taken and ends with nuclear war.  This is not the CD you want to put on to liven up a party or if you're struggling with depression.<br /><br />It's good enough...and \\"When The Tigers Broke Free\\" is a nice addition...but while this album would be a decent enough effort from anyone else (and as a Roger Waters solo album it tops anything else he's done, for what that's worth), Pink Floyd under better -or even tolerably friendly- conditions can top this easily.  \\"A Momentary Lapse Of Reason\\", released only four years later without Waters' participation at all, proves this most ably., is also the one track where Gilmour's influence is felt the most.      Ultimately, the reason this album failed to resonate despite the terrific production values (almost anything Michael Kamen lends his name to is quality work; his efforts here are no exception) lies not with the artist's presentation but with his vision; it is a far more personal album that the listener, unless he or she is a socially disenfranchised British liberal rock star who has lost a parent to a war and whose family is in a state of disarray of its own, PROBABLY isn't going to be able to relate to regardless of how well the songwriting (which is subpar for Pink Floyd but not resoundingly poor) or production (which is amazing; this is a magnificent CD to listen to with headphones; a SACD/DTS 5:1 version of this, like any Pink Floyd album, would be extremely well-received).

1878424319|1.0|I read this book at the request of a friend for a reading group, not for my own particular interest. <br /> <br />Ruiz occasionally made an interesting point, but his content was far from earth-shattering. The largest put-off to me was his repetitive and preachy style of writing. I felt my intelligence as a reader insulted by his constant almost-nagging. Perhaps this is the style in which most self-help and new age drivel is written, but I feel the book could have been far more poignant at about a quarter the length.
B0006399FS|1.0|ATYCLB was commercial enough! but this?! Bono? what in the world is wrong with you?! <br /> <br />buy Rearviewmirror from Pearl Jam instead.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I completely agree that this movie reestablishes and remakes the old and forgotten but such important Hollywood genre of musical theatre. Don't forget that the director who also did Strictly Ballroom and Romeo and Juliette studied Bollywood spectacle in order to make Moulin Rouge. I fall in love with this movie time and again.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Pearl Jam really came through on this one! its my favorite album ever and no album deserves more repeated listens! Pearl Jam started the 1990s being the best band of that decade and Binaural proves Pearl Jam to be the best band 2000- since!
B000002I25|5.0|The Doors is one of the best bands ever. Period. Jim Morrison was a lyrical genius Robbie Krieger is one of the greatest guitarists ever.  Next To The Velvet Underground and Nico and  its one of the greatest debut albums ever.  Anyone that says that Limp Bizkit or Korn is better then anybody is stupid. Even though I don't care for Zepplin but they're way better then them.  How can you possibly in your right mind say that you would want The New Kids on the Block instead of the doors, I'd rather kill myself then listen to them honestly.  The lyrics are great no denying it he's one of the greatest poets to ever pick up a pen.  The music is just stunning it's amazing what they did without a bassist.   <br /> <br />P.S. D. Berstien read up on your history The Velvets came before Velvet Revolver (they suck too)

B0006399FS|5.0|I have read that people think \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" is \\"safe\\" or \\"background music\\" or \\"going through the motions.\\"  This album is NONE of these things.  As a U2 fan starting in the \\"War\\" era, I have heard all the different styles this band has toyed with.  The early stuff was great for me, most of the newer stuff hasn't thrilled me.  When U2 released \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" to all the \\"return-to-form\\" hoopla, I was excited.  I was then let down by much of that album.  However, I see now that it was the start of the metamorphosis.  U2 was starting to change from rock stars to musicians again.  That is what \\"HTDAAB\\" is about.  It is about a group of friends and musicians who have played the \\"rock star\\" thing long enough returning to what they really, truly do.  They play music.  This is BY FAR the most musical album U2 has put out since \\"The Joshua Tree.\\"  But what you hear is a culmination of all the things they have done since they started.  In \\"All Because of You\\" you can hear vocals that remind you of the very earliest stuff the band recorded.  In \\"Love and Peace\\" you can hear the \\"Rattle and Hum\\" bluesy/R&B influence (done much better this time).  And throughout the album you can hear Bono's voice soaring like it did throughout the 80's with The Edge's jangly guitars sharing the spotlight.   <br /> <br />This is a deep, personal album and the lyrics reflect that.  At a time when deep and personal is almost unheard of, it is refreshing and decidedly not \\"safe.\\"  The lyrics are tremendous and Bono's voice is the best I have ever heard it--plain and simple.  The Edge has rediscovered his signature guitar riffs and they are everywhere in this album.  Adam Clayton, always the guy in the background, gets to step front and center and his contribution to this album is stunning.  Larry does what Larry does.  He keeps everything moving and does so with ease.  This album is deep, reflective, moody, and BEAUTIFUL.  U2 are musicians again.  Not rock gods.  Not pop stars.  Musicians.  The music does the talking, and what it has to say is very worth listening to.

B00005JMUL|5.0|I confess that I was rather skeptical when I heard The Polar Express was being made into a movie.  It is the rare occasion when any film does a good book justice, but one as short as this...I could not imagine what they would do with it.  What they did was create an absolutely delightful film that our entire family enjoyed. <br /> <br />The storyline was compelling and the computer animation was beyond superb.  It was possible, at times, to forget that this was animated.  The people and scenes looked so real. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this film and, if you live in the city, do try to see it in 3-D.  We could have but we opted for the plain version.  I can imagine it is even a better experience.  I think we may go back and do that. :-)
B0002VEPRQ|3.0|Like many people, I saw the movie as a youngster and had the sound track record.  When the DVD first came out, I was upset to find that some of it was missing!  For example, a scene where the kids are actually making the kite with paper and glue with a too-large brush and the dog makes a mess of things; at the very end Burt saying \\"I love you, Mary Poppins\\" as she floats off.  With DVDs we expect a longer \\"directors cut\\" of a movie, not an abridged shortened version! <br /> <br />Looking at the other editions for sale here, I see the running length is the same.  So, what I'd like to know is: is the full reature restored in this 40th anniversary edition?  I'd by it if it was.
B00005JMXX|2.0|I watched this movie last night of pay-per-view (had a free movie coupon). The action scenes and special effects were great. The acting was fair. The plot and tone were awful. <br />                <br />Make no bones about it, this is an anti-industrial, anti-capitalist propaganda movie, which manages to take hateful cheap shots at President Bush (dim, indecisive) and Vice President Cheney (uncarring money-grubbing capitalist) along the way. <br /> <br />The evil industrialized world (mainly American) has pumped too much greenhouse gas into the atmoshpere, which heats up the planet, which melts the polar ice caps, which dilutes the salt content of the oceans, which screws up ocean currents, which causes the ocean tempurature to drop suddenly, which causes world-wide super-storms, which bring on the next ice age in about two weeks. <br /> <br />Some reviewers have suggested ignoring the fear-mongering junk science of this movie and just enjoy the ride. That's fine if you can do it. The problem is that this is \\"message\\" movie. Be prepared to be alternately entertained and offended unless your one of those eco-nutjobs who buy into that garbage.
1858286999|4.0|Although I tend to favour Lonely Planet over the Rough Guide, in the case of Japan, the Rough Guide is definitely preferable, and this is increasingly the case now that the latest edition of the Lonely Planet has cut coverage of lots of off-the-beaten-track areas. The Rough Guide to Japan has the edge is conveying the feel of the places covered. I have lived in Japan for more than two years and the guide was practical and sensible on my first trips to Hiroshima and Kyoto - I still find it informative and helpful when I travel around the country now, after substantial experience of Japan. One caveat - while the coverage of such cultural sites as temples and castles is very thorough, the author is obviously not that interested in painting or sculpture. Museum after museum is dismissed for being overpriced, often when the entrance fees are, by Japanese standards, really very reasonable (600 yen or so). Some readers might be put off visiting interesting museums by this bias. <br /> <br />Japan is a fascinating and frustrating country. So much of its natural beauty and traditional architecture has been destroyed, but it remains an endlessly intriguing place. It deserves more visitors than it gets, but many people are put off by two main difficulties: expenses, and the scarcity of English speakers, especially outside the main cities. The Rough Guide gives useful tips on reasonably priced and pleasant accommodation; I have rarely been disappointed by a hotel or traditional inn they recommend. It also gives detailed explanations of how to get around off the beaten track, which should ease the path for the non-Japanese speaker. Newcomers and veterans alike should have few complaints.
0330485377|5.0|This novel deals with the most heartbreaking situation one can go through-- the loss of a loved one in the most inhumane way. Though a fiction story, its detailed language will make you cry and hope, at the same time making you truly believe and forget its just a book.  The descriptive and vivid language will also take a life of its own, easily allowing you to visualize every moment, every cry, and every ravaging stare in a characters eyes.  The Lovely Bones is a story that made me believe in the impossible and feel the pain of every character, especially of the narrator. A heart-warming story of love and tragedy full of hope, disappointment, light and heartache; truly a life lesson indeed. And of course, a life lesson you wont be able to put down!
B0001AP12G|5.0|Every now and then an album gets dropped and its instantly deemed a classic.  Kanye West's \\"College Dropout\\" is one of those albums.  It ranks up there with \\"The Chronic\\" and \\"All Eyes On Me\\".  The album bridges the gap between gangsta and conscious style hip hop.  The production is amazing on every track including \\"The New Workout Plan\\" which samples the Roger Troutman sound.  Kanye's lyrics stand out especially on \\"Two Words\\", \\"Jesus Walks\\" and \\"Last Call\\".  The album has stellar guest appearances by Jay-z, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Common, and Freeway.  It is refreshing to hear an album with such originality in a hip-hop world that is infauated with fake studio gangsters and talking about how rich you are.
0316548189|5.0|A superbly written biography, with enough details to bring Mandela's wit, honesty and humility to life.
044024157X|4.0|This book is one of John Grisham's best books. The plot is interesting although one flaw I would like to address is that he tries to open up too many issues within the book. At times the reader forgets the whole point of the book. But most of the time it was very entertaining and is a good read for anyone who likes thrillers.  <br /> <br />Another strong point of the book are the characters. Danny Padgitt, the rapist part of a sleazy bootlegging family,is quite believable as you might find such characters rural areas. Willie Traynor, a college dropout who persuades his rich aunt to loan  <br />him enough money to buy the local newspaper. Callie, the mild-mannered african-american woman Willie befriends while in Missippi. And also a sleazy lawyer bent upon getting his client, Danny Padgitt out of jail.  <br /> <br />The conclusion is quite surprising and expected at the same time. This makes it a worthy read. <br /> <br />Chand <br />
B0002X314C|5.0|\\"Get Lifted\\" is truly an amazing work. A friend turned me on to John Legend after his first single \\"Used to Love U\\". I visited his website and previewed the snippets from his upcoming album and felt like I needed to hear more of him. He just drew me to him. And after seeing him perform live in Kansas City, I was immediately hooked. The album is great but his live performances are powerful. You just feel the emotion from every word that his sings.  <br /> <br />It's been a long time since I've been able to play a CD in its entirety. I'm a R&B fan to the core and I like an artist to have substance and skill and presence that draws you and makes you live and feel whatever they're singing about. John Legend definitely has the \\"IT\\" factor.  <br /> <br />People can sleep on him if they want to. But those who truly love R&B and are true music lovers will embrace the gift that he has been blessed with. <br /> <br />My favorite cuts on the album are between \\"Ordinary People\\" and \\"She Don't Have to Know\\". His live performances of those songs are electrifying. I also love \\"Refuge\\" and \\"Alright\\". It's really hard to pick between songs because they are all wonderful. <br /> <br />\\"Get Lifted\\" is a must have. No doubt about it!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napoleon Dynamite is a corky yet offbeat and hilarious film that follows an Idahoan nerd around in his simpleton lifestyle.  It is especially recommended for people who like movies such as Dumb and Dumber, Office Space and other movies that include quite dry humor.  Napoleon lives in Preston, Idaho where he attends Junior High and is especially interested in mythical drawings and ninja moves.  His 32 year old brother Kip, still lives at the home and finds love online while aspiring to be a cagefighter.  His Uncle Rico is a suave businessman with a money hungry attitude, and also can't stop thinking about his 1982 football game which he is convinced he would have won and continues to relive his memories over and over again.  Napoleon becomes friends with Pedro-who also runs for class president against the popular Summer.  Deb is a stuck in the 80's do-it-at-home kind of gal who also becomes good friends with Napoleon.  This is probably, if not my favorite, one of the best movies ever made!!!  Being an Idahoan, I don't find it offensive at all.  It is somewhat true, although exaggerated.  So if you're still sitting there wondering if you should pick up this movie, just do it!!!  If you really don't think you'll like it, rent it first, but I definately recommend it.
B0002X314C|5.0|This cd is great. Great lyrics, smooth voice, nice beats. John Legend started this year off right with this powerful cd. Get Lifted is right up there with recent Releases from Joss Stone and Jill Scott. <br />My Favorites so far are lets get lifted, Ordinary people and She don't have to know. <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've held off writing this review for several weeks -- just wanted to be sure, but yes, this is the best CD to be made in years. An instant classic, a CD you love more each time you play it and something you'll be listening to years from now (I am assuming you like rock music).<br /><br />It's like Green Day took the pulse of America and is reading it back to us accurately in the form of brilliant rock lyrics, melodies, musicianship and vocals. Brilliant social commentary with a lot of deep personal feeling. Innovative song structures, taking punk rock and stretching it beyond any place it's gone before.<br /><br />At times I thought rock had died when Kurt Cobain killed himself. Now I know I was wrong. Thanks Billy Joe & Co. (Green Day) for this amazing disc. I hope you just started a new era in the world of rock 'n roll.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|I've seen about 78, 2004 movies. I think the best film of the year is \\"Kill Bill Vo.2\\" and this is a close second.The performances are absolutely amazing.Jamie Foxx has been getting the best reviews for this film and I think he will be nominated <br />for Best Supporting Actor for this film. But it doesn't matter, <br />'cause he's probably gonna win Best Actor for \\"Ray\\". Tom Cruise gives an Oscar worthy performance but I don't think Cruise is gonna score gold this year. I just have one problem with this film. The cinematography. It's filmed a little too much like, <br />I-was-there-and-got-it-all-on-tape kind of stuff. It looks to be filmed with nothing but a handheld. But,the story (by \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" writer Stuart Beattie) is spectacular and it's masterfully directed by Michael Mann. The film is about Max (Foxx). Max is driving a cab in an attempt to get enough money to <br />open his own limo business (a dream that's going nowhere). He says it's part time, but he's been driving for 12 years. One day his luck changes when he meets a woman (Jada Pinkett Smith) and might score a date. But with good luck, comes bad luck and Max meets Vincent (Cruise). Vincent offers Max six hundred dollars to take him to six stops on \\"real estate business\\". Problem is at the first stop a body falls on top of Max's cab and Max discovers Vincent is a hit man. The two develop a sort of weird friendship along the way,but the movie is totally suspenceful and just plain terrific. Tom Cruise with his gunmetal gray hair kind of makes the movie what it is. It's his best performance since \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\". Jamie Foxx (who started off as a comedian, then came into drama with Oliver Stone's crappy <br />\\"Any Given Sunday\\") gives his best performance until a few months later when \\"Ray\\" was released. But, yeah see this movie for sure. You won't regret it. A+.
B000002P5R|5.0|This album in its own way is one of Jimi's best. Are You Experienced will never be surpassed in most critics or fans eyes. Because it was the first impact on the music world of his genius. Nobody knows if this would've been the album Jimi would've put out there had he lived. But its worth the money just for these 4 tracks <br /> <br />Angel/ Absolutely gorgeous <br />Eazy Rider/ Funky Psychedelic rocker with a great riff <br />Freedom/ another great driving track <br />Room Full Of Mirrors/ awesome guitar work
0553260111|5.0|I was not familiar with Jason Bourne until after watching the movie, and I read the book anticipating that, like most movie/book combo's, the book would be much better.  I was not prepared, however, for just how MUCH better the book is. <br /> <br />Surprisingly, the movie and the book share very few commonalities.  Jason Bourne has the same name, but otherwise it's two stories running in opposite directions.  The main antagonist in the movie is a CIA desk jockey at Langley, but in the book it's Carlos the Jackal - a character completely missing from the movie. <br /> <br />Marie is also much more then a not-so-bright brunette who can't get a Visa to the U.S., she an older and more mature international finance expert who helps Jason wire and hide the large stash of cash he carries out of the bank in Zurich. <br /> <br />The paper-thin plot of the movie amounts to nothing more then this:  Jason Bourne, a government trained assassin, botched a job, got shot in back in the process, and now has amnesia.  The CIA only knows that he failed to make an assigned kill and now wants him dead.  While trying to run from his former employer he must also try and discover his own identity. <br /> <br />Now, in the book, add this element:  Jason Bourne is NOT Jason Bourne, but an ex-military special ops agent who assumed that identity to trap the elusive international assassin Carlos the Jackal.  While trying to discover his own identity (of which he has two) he must also try to capture and avoid being killed by Carlos, who wants his dead, and try to re-establish contact with his former employer who can't understand why he seems to have turned, and who also wants him dead. <br /> <br />In a nutshell... if you loved the movie then the book is a must. <br />
B00006AG5N|2.0|Elvis has always been overatted and this album displays that fact. The most pampered ego in music history had something in the 50s but became a joke from the 60s on. Also someones telling porkies here. Elvis only had 18 number ones in his career. The Beatles are far superior and more creative. I suggest you buy their ONES album which is the work of true geniuses!
B00005JMYI|3.0|After watching \\"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,\\" it is clear to me that the funniest television anchorman of all-time remains Ted Baxter on \\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show.\\"  I say this knowing that for the most part I could not stand the Ted Baxter character and while I was not exactly wincing at the one-liners in this 2004 comedy, I was not laughing a lot either.  The script by director Adam McKay and star Will Ferrell sets up some comic opportunities but tends not to take advantage of them.  For example, it is established early on that Burgundy will say anything that is written on a teleprompter.  While this comes up as a major plot development, it strikes me as a waste of a really good running gag because they could have come up with so much more.<br /><br />Ron Burgundy represents the news anchor in his prime, circa San Diego in the 1970s.  Arrogant and narcissistic, not to mention incapable of saying anything that does not sound pompous and egotistical, Burgundy is enabled by his producer Ed Harken (Fred Willard), and the rest of the evening news team: hip roving reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), sports reporter Champ Kind (David Koechner), and clueless weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell, Bruce Almighty).  Into their male dominated world comes Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate), who wants to read the news her self, apparently unconcerned that it is a man's job.  Thus, the battle lines are drawn between Veronica and all of the guys as the station.<br /><br />Now, a battle of the sexes sounds pretty good, but that idea is undercut by the fact that a romance springs up between Burgundy and Corningstone.  The fact that they have the hots for each other does not take away from their ambition, and the funniest scenes for me in the film are when the two of them are muttering insults each other at the end of the newscast while the credits role.  But there should have been a lot more comedy to be milked from their on camera battles, and \\"Anchorman\\" is to busy running on to the next bit to stop and figure out how everything fits together.  This is a film that has people singing \\"Afternoon Delight\\" at one moment and then has news teams getting ready to rumble in a back alley.  But it never comes together with any sort of unified comedy theory that makes it all work.  Instead we are left with bits and pieces with as many misses as hits.<br /><br />The bottom line for me is that \\"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy\\" should have been a satire, and it ends up being nothing more than an over-extended comedy sketch.  The movie is set in the 1970s and you would think that should come into play more in terms of the comedy, but it really does not.  The flaw, I suspect, is that McKay and Ferrell know that their SNL audience has little in the way of a rudimentary knowledge of that particular decade (to wit, leisure suits and facial hair), so the story is set back then simply so the idea of a female news anchor can be see as a radical idea.  But even that become another font of comic opportunity that \\"Anchorman\\" neglects to use to great effect.  The result is okay, and Ferrell certainly tries hard, but for me the entire movie has as many laughs as one of his really good SNL skits, and when you are talking a feature length movie, that is not a good thing.man\\" is to busy running on to the next bit to stop and figure out how everything fits together.

B00025ETIW|5.0|This band is awesome. Overated you all say??? Not at all! I've seen them in concert twice now and I'd go see them a 100 more times! The world needs good rock music these days and thanks to MCR I don't have to listen to crapy radio stations for a while.
B00009V7P8|4.0|I bought this CD after I heard the Blower's Daughter in the movie Closer and read some good reviews.  Initially, I was a bit disappointed, but I'm okay with needing to listen a few times before an album grows on me.  And the album has done just that.  <br /> <br />Having said that, I think there are only a few songs on this album that really stand out as great songs.  The Blower's Daughter is one of them, the first hidden track and I Remember are the others.   <br /> <br />I think Rice's main downfall is that he clearly has the ability to be fantastic, but for me at least, many of these songs fall short.  Even I Remember, which may be my favorite song on the album, leaves me wanting more.  What a powerful song, but it would have been so much better if Hannigan had joined in toward the end with some harmonizing and the two of them had really \\"rocked out\\" (for lack of a better term) together. <br /> <br />Ultimately, this is a CD worth having in your collection and I think I'll listen to it quite often.  I just don't think it quite deserves the RAVE reviews it has received on this site.  I'm looking forward to his next album, where he'll hopefully take it up just one notch to create an absolutely awesome album. <br /> <br />A side note: another reviewer mentioned the quality of the CD due to him doing some of the recording in his home.  I agree, my favorite songs, the really powerful ones, can't be listened to at really loud volumes for fear of blowing my speakers, or my eardrums.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|the movie is good enough to make you cry.  this DVD release is bad enough to also make you cry.  the subtitles + captions are annoying as all heck.  and even if you don't like dubs, the lack of one here is sub-par and shows a lack of care on the part of go fish/dreamworks SKG.  finally, as trivial as it is, the cover is an insult to the art and theme of the movie.  the original japanese poster art wasn't good enough?<br /><br />dreamworks really put on all the stops.  if this is their idea of appropriate treatment of a great piece of anime, \\"one of the ABSOLUTE BEST films you'll see this year\\", they should just stop entirely.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|ONE POSITIVE THING TO SAY ABOUT 2005 IS THE RELEASE OF MACGYVER <br />TO DVD. ALTHOUGH NUMEROUS BOOTLEG EDITIONS HAVE BEEN RELEASED, THIS IS THE FIRST OFFICIAL U.S. RELEASE FROM PARAMOUNT!! <br />MACGYVER IS THE MOST ORIGINAL TELEVISION SERIES OF ALL TIME AND THE CHARACTER CANNOT BE COMPARED BY ANY OTHER. <br />IT'S ABOUT TIME A DESERVING TELEVISION SERIES GETS IT TIME TO SHINE!! <br />THANKS PARAMOUNT!!!!!
B00005JNBQ|4.0|When I first watched this movie, I was totally bored.  I thought this was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life UNTIL I watched it again.<br /><br />There were moments that I \\"didn't get\\" the first time around, but found hillarious after watching it again.  It's *VERY* dry humor...there's no sex, drugs, cussing, special effects to which we are all accustomed to.<br /><br />The movie isn't really about anything, but the characters are what make the movie funny.<br /><br />Napoleon - he's got red frizzy hair, his lips don't touch, wears Unicorn tshirts and wierd moon looking boots (No, they aren't Uggs)<br /><br />Kip - his 30 year old something brother (I think) that lives with Napoleon & their Grandmother.  He is the total white guy down to the knee socks with deck shoes.  He's addicted to chat rooms and finds the love of his life there.<br /><br />The Uncle - an 80's has been football player who just wants to go back in time to become a famous athlete.<br /><br />Summer - Hillary Duff's sister - was suppossed to be the \\"Popular girl\\" in school, but wasn't impressed with her performance.<br /><br />Pedro - answer's in \\"Yes's\\" and \\"No's\\" most of the time and manages a smile at the end.<br /><br />I'm really glad that I gave ND a second chance (and had to pay a late fee.....) to watch again and really enjoy a good laugh.
B0006VIE4C|3.0|Well, most people prefer The Empire Strikes Back, but I found it boring, it's just living off the success of the superior and more successful, \\"Star Wars.\\"  <br /> <br />This movie is good. No doubt about it. Grossed over $307 million in 1977, DESTROYING all other records, took home, I believe, 7 academy awards, and was nominated for 10. In 1997, Lucas reworked Star Wars. And made it crap. <br /> <br />Greedo shooting first is bad. Though some claims he shoots the same time Han does (not true). Han shot at many other things that did not shoot at him first, such as a stormtrooper in Star Wars, a Minoc, space slug, an officer on the Death Star, and hell even Vader's wingman in Star Wars. Why not just change all of this? I mean, Vader's wing man was just trying to protect Darth Vader, it would be CRAZY for Han to protect his friend and millions of others!  <br /> <br />Even if Greedo DID shoot at the same time as Han (which he did not), he really sucks, and I am surprised Jabba would choose such an idiot Bounty Hunter to get Han. Even a Stormtrooper could hit Han at this distance! Han shooting first does not make him \\"cold (blooded)\\" --- it makes Han COOL. I think I would shoot at someone if they held a gun at me first. This change is so poltically correct it's not even funny. Worse change in the series.  <br /> <br />Jabba the Hutt just repeats what Greedo told Han about. It's not good film making when you have 2 of the same conversations in a short amount of time. Worthless scene. <br /> <br />The Mos Eisley change is horrible. Here is a quote from Film Buff Online, [...]  <br />\\"Originally Star Wars' Mos Eisley spaceport was rather unimpressive as a city, befitting of Luke Skywalker's complaints that his home planet of Tattoine \\"was the furthest planet from the bright center of the galaxy. (...) The end result is Mos Eisley now has all the hustle and bustle of downtown Manhattan and Luke sounds like a kid complaining about living less than an hour away in the Jerseysuburbs.\\"  <br /> <br />And some of the music is changed. The music in Star Wars was THE best and George changed it. Well, if he wanted to change it now, why didn't he just do so back in 1977? Same with Greedo, why didn't he make Greedo shoot first in 1977? Easy: For the kids. <br /> <br />Anyways, even though the DVD changes are bad, the movie still kicks tons of ass. And this one (not Empire or ROTJ) will be remembered through history... well, the one that came out in 1977.
B000003TA4|2.0|I heard of Pearl Jam before I heard of Nirvana... & got the Pearl Jam album \\"Ten\\" 1 yr & 1/2 before I finally picked up \\"Nevermind\\"... <br /> <br />Sorry Nirvana fans... but after you get so used to listening to \\"Ten\\" by Pearl Jam... \\"Nevermind\\" just doesnt live up to it. <br /> <br />Besides, Pearl Jam were more original than Nirvana... Nirvana was just a rehash of the Pixies, but Pearl Jam were really doing things other bands didnt do before.
B0001WTVUW|4.0|Made in 1983 The Day After gives the viewer an honest look at the aftermath of a nuclear exchange back in the cold war days when the US and USSR had hundreds of ICBM's aimed at each other. A made-for-TV-movie the movie lacks the big budget effects, and more than likely blew most of its money on hiring Jason Robards, but still manages to give the viewewr the creeps when the bombs do hit. There's poor acting abound and too many subplots aren't fleshed out enough for the two hours. This should have been a mini-series of about 6-8 hours to get a full effect of the disaster. Nontheless a worthy anti-war movie that shoots from the heart and not from some Hollywood suit's demographics chart.

B00003CX9Q|4.0|In 2002, Steven Spielberg decided to release an updated version of his 1982 classic \\"E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial\\". Universal announced that this update included new footage and new digital effects. Some people complain about the new special effects and the added scenes, but to be honest, it's not a big change, it's just some makeup that doesn't change the heart and soul of the movie: the story and the characters. <br /> <br />This movie features our favorite alien, a little squashy guy known as E.T., he gets involved in a very special relationship with a little boy when he is left alone in the Earth. And that friendship is one of the strongest things about \\"E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial\\". Steven Spielberg created a great dynamic with the cast (specially the children), it's easy to see the wide display of emotions that these young actors printed on the movie. The adults are very good, but the young actors stole the show on this film. <br /> <br />\\"E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial\\" has some of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history, a lot of people was touched with the brief death of E.T., or the return of the little alien to his home, or the magical scene when Elliott and E.T. cross the sky at night in a bicycle with the moon as background. This movie is the best thing that most of the cast was involved in. Henry Thomas (Elliott) and Robert MacNaughton (Michael) never were involved in a project of this size. Only Drew Barrymore remains very popular today, but most of the people will forever see her as the cute Gertie. <br /> <br />Steven Spielberg solidified an already strong reputation as a remarkable filmmaker with \\"E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial\\", and John Williams (his favorite composer) created more incredible songs for the score of the movie. Spielberg filmed movies of greater scale, but \\"E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial\\" remains as his more emotional movie. The DVD features great stuff that the fans of this movie will love, so if you like \\"E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial\\", thenthe DVD is a must-buy
B0002X314C|5.0|This CD it a prime example of what good music should  be. It shows talent and creativity, awesome style and the nice soul flavor that everybody looks for. His unique voice pull syou into hang onto every word he has to share in his romantic melodies. this is the feel good music that we all yearn for but never get. this is better than a debut CD. He is star shining on his own that everyone is sleeping on, but he will make it. His songs like Ordinary People and So High, and Stay with you are my favorites that put you in the mood to love and be loved. this whole CD is one you you can listen to from start to finish over and ver again.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|When the western genre was created, it was designed to entertain, to thrill the audiences and to tell stories about heroes defeating the evil. But when Sergio Leone took the genre on his hands, he re-designed the structure of these movies. One thing that he changed, was the introduction of anti-heroes, the central characters no longer were heroes, but instead the antiheroes were introduced in the revisionist genre known as the \\"Spaghetti Western\\". All the characters have inner demons and secrets that haunt them. <br /> <br />\\"Once Upon A Time In The West\\" is the most artistic western that you can see. The cinematography shows a lot of beautiful landscapes and the territory becomes another character. The pace of this movie is very special, it has an operatic quality that sets this movie apart from the conventional westerns. <br /> <br />Ennio Morricone was the composer of the soundtrack for this movie, and it's one of his finest scores, as a matter of fact, his only other score that can compare with the music of \\"Once Upon A Time In The West\\", is the music score that he created for \\"The Good, The Bad And The Ugly\\". Every character has a distinctive tune that tells the audience a lot about their personality. <br /> <br />But all this wouldn't be important if the characters and the script were bad, but Sergio Leone, Dario Argento and Bernardo Bertolucci penned a powerful story, packed with deep characters and realistic situations, this movie is about love, fury, revenge, betrayal, progress and honor. This kind of story needed a solid cast to be filmed, and \\"Once Upon A Time In The West\\" has perhaps the best cast in a western. <br /> <br />Charles Bronson is \\"Harmonica\\", a man that has a lot of secrets and a mistery aura, at the beginning of the movie we don't know exactly if he is just another villain, or if he is the hero. Jason Robards is Cheyenne, an outlaw that gets involved in the story trying to clean his already tainted name. Claudia Cardinale is Jill, a beautiful woman that is trying to start a new life, away from her troubled past, but she can't find the peace that she was looking for. And finally Henry Fonda, that GREAT, GREAT actor that made a reputation of playing the role of the good and honorable guy, portrays one of the most impressive villains that you will ever find in a movie. <br /> <br />This DVD is a must-buy just for the reason that the movie is presented in Widescreen, but thankfully, Paramount included worthy features like the audio commentary and some documentaries that are very informative and valuable. \\"Once Upon A Time In The West\\" not only is one of the greatest westerns (the greatest for a lot of people), but it is one of the greatest movies of all-time as well.

The video and sound were superb on LD, the sound was so brilliant and defining. Whoever did the transfer to DVD ought to be shot. 5.1 sound is OK for planes flying around your house but not music. No one listens to music that way, it's rediculous.

B00005K9LN|5.0|I can't praise this album any more than all of the other reviewers. Yes, this album is THAT good!The clean but powerful production has prevented BRITISH STEEL from sounding too dated (compared to other albums of the era, like SAXON and even the mighty MAIDEN). This was the expected leap forward suggested on the live album UNLEASHED IN THE EAST, filling the promise of a tougher and heavier, yet more accesible sound. \\"Breaking The Law\\" is a good song for guitar beginners and its simplicity made this song so memorable. \\"Rapid Fire\\" is, like other reviewers have said, an almost full fledged thrash metal song, with its rapid guitar strumming, double bass drumming and lead break mayhem. \\"Metal Gods\\" has to be one of the most memorable metal riffs ever commited to tape. \\"The Rage\\" showed PRIEST's most versatile style, with its almost reggae like intro and the album's closer, \\"Steeler\\" is another mid paced thrasher with an intense riff (very similar to what bands like METALLICA would do years later).  <br />One thing that no one has mentioned about the remastered version of BRITISH STEEL is the song order. The remastered version starts off with \\"Rapid Fire\\", a song that was originally right after opener \\"Breaking the law\\". I think song order is very important and I'll have to wonder why PRIEST decided on changing it. I was so bugged by the change of song order that I had to trade in my remastered copy! I still have the original printing, but wished I could have it remastered WITh the correct song order. I hope other older PRIEST fans take notice!
B0006A9FKA|4.0|This is one of those British jewels that once in a while come from England to show how you can make very good movies with moderate budgets... SHAUN OF THE DEAD is fun, but not stupid fun: it's a very good movie. And beware of the scene where on of the heroes trapped inside the Winchester is teared apart while still alive by a mass of zombies. Even in a comedy-horror movie, it was one of the most terrifying scene I've ever seen!

While trying to drag out the climax of the story in a complex plot, he just made the book a lot longer and slower than it could have been. Most of the details of the story do not follow the plot but are just extra or \\"filler\\". That the story was well written and had a few surprises did not matter once the reader looses intrest. The one thing I did love in the story was the awsome ability that Grisham has to create live characters like the Pidgets, one of the more well written character bases.
0064407667|4.0|I saw the movie before I bought the books, and I thought the movie was good! The books are simply addictive and you jsut can't put them down: I have to bring the following book when I found that I have finished 3/4 of each book. The series is very imaginative, Harry Potter became predictable in comparison (no offense, I'm an HP fan myself). The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because they can be tedious, a word meaning the author can get over-explainatory, sometimes. I thoughoutly enjoyed the books. To those who haven't read the books yet: watch the movie first, then read the books. The movie is at its best a teaser to the series.
6302878527|5.0|This is the finest film Audrey Hepburn ever made. Decades ahead of its time, \\"Two For The Road\\" really anticipates the crazy narrative contortions of Charlie Kaufman and other modern screenwriters and still feels daring today. However, the relationship between Hepburn and Finney is so genuine and the dialogue so wittily precise that you'll never care about the exact chronology, which is almost impossible to figure out anyway. You'll just revel in one of the most hilarious and charming yet bitingly honest films about romance ever made. I have to imagine \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" owes something to this masterpiece.    The seemingly simple narrative hook is this; Mark and Joanna meet while travelling across France. They then make the same journey at numerous points in their married lives, sometimes together, a few times alone. The genius of Raphael's screenplay is to intercut all of these trips, without any attempt to explain which trip we are seeing each time - there are no titles saying \\"1956\\" or \\"1964\\" at each change. Instead, we are able to follow the timeline by the way in which their relationship changes from lovers to newlyweds to bored spouses.     The specifics of time, like fashion, and other little clues, do make it fairly easy to follow the chronology if you absolutely must, but it's not at all vital. (Hint - there's always a large annual registration sticker on the windshield of whatever car they're driving, which tells you when the scene takes place, if you just have to know.)
B000002JSP|4.0|Some reviewers believe that if John Bonham had not died, this album represents what the mighty Led Zep would have sounded like during the 80's. What is not understood is what was going on in the band in the late 70's. Pagey's heroin habit was catching up to him, which explains why he is such a non-entity. Take a good look at the song credits, nearly every single song includes John Paul Jones in the writing credits. This is a Jonesy/Percy album, not a Pagey/Percy album, and yet another facet of the band that included folk (III), pop (Houses of the Holy), blues (I & II) and hard rock (Physical Graffitti, Presence), and combinations of all of the above (IV) in their repertoire. Check out the outtakes from these sessions that appear on Coda. Page is back in control of the band and back in form (Darlene, Walter's Walk). In Through The Out Door is just another step (albeit the final one) in the wonderful musical journey known as Led Zeppelin.
B00008D1NF|4.0|Carlinhos Brown, Arnaldo Antunes and Marisa Monte are well-known contemporary Brazilian artists who had never made a cd together, until \\"Tribalistas\\". They met almost by chance in March 2001 in Salvador de Bah&iacute;a (Brazil) and composed quite a few songs. Some of those songs were recorded by them a year later, and this album is the result of that great effort. In my opinion, \\"Tribalistas\\" is the kind of album you cannot help but enjoy, even if you don't understand Portuguese (the language in which these artists sing). This cd blends the different styles and voices of the artists that participate in it, and the final result is awesome, filled with rhythm and intensity.<br /><br />Personally, I liked many of these songs, but my favourites are probably \\"Carnav&aacute;lia\\" (a song that makes me think of the Brazilian carnival, \\"Vem pra minha ala que hoje a nossa escola vai desfilar, vem fazer hist&oacute;ria que hoje &eacute; dia de gl&oacute;ria neste lugar, vem comemorar, escandalizar ningu&eacute;m, vem me namorar vou te namorar tamb&eacute;m, vamos pra avenida, desfilar a vida, carnavalizar\\"), \\"Passe em casa\\" (\\"Passam p&aacute;ssaros e aviões e no chão os caminhões, passa o tempo, as estações, passam andorinhas e verões\\") and \\"Ja sei namorar\\" (\\"Tô te querendo como ningu&eacute;m, tô te querendo como Deus quiser, tô te querendo como te quero, tô te querendo como se quer\\"). If you are really interested in the lyrics and you can't speak Portuguese, you can either search for a translation or learn Portuguese  :)<br /><br />I believe that Brown, Antunes and Monte have made an excellent cd in this, their first collaboration, and that you will be lucky to have it. On the other hand, you may like only some songs, so just in case try to check it out in a store before buying it. On the whole, I think you should at least listen to it, and reach your own decision. \\"Tribalistas\\" might have some of your future favourite songs, just waiting for you  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat
038551123X|5.0|Dexter is a blood spatter analyst, helping the Miami police capture killers by day, while by night--certain nights, when the moon is right and all preparations are made--he creates his own justice.  You see, Dexter is a serial killer of serial killers.<br /><br />His sister, Deborah, is a Vice Officer on the same police force, and she comes to Dexter for help on the case of a new serial killer that is preying on the Miami prostitutes.  Though Dexter is a \\"nerd cop\\" (as he puts it) and not an actual detective, he has gained a bit of a reputation for having an special insight into the minds of serial killers.  If they--especially Deb!--only knew why. . .<br /><br />Dexter is torn between his desire to help Deb succeed and move up the career ladder, and his desire to save this new, artistic and terribly appealing killer for himself.  There's never a question that Dexter wants to stop the killer.  Or is there?<br /><br />This killer seems to be calling to Dexter, speaking specifically to him, asking him to come play.  And oh how Dexter wants to play!  As more bodies pile up, and more \\"Dexter, come play\\" messages appear, Dexter struggles to stay sane working on this case.  There are times he wonders if he himself could be this latest amazing serial killer, especially as he begins dreaming about the latest killings before they happen!<br /><br />The result:  a disturbingly enjoyable novel, well-written mystery and suspense, lots of laugh out loud dark humor and a hero that I almost feel guilty for liking.  But like him I do.  Lindsay has created a complex character and a book that deserves a full five stars.  Even if I feel a wee bit guilty for recommended it!
B00000J2PH|5.0|My mother had the original LP, but I used to play it until unfortunately, I eventually wore out the grooves!  I am happy that it is remastered and included some gems worth listening to!
1401301010|5.0|I have always enjoyed the music that the chili's put out, especially from Mothers Milk onwards, so when i saw that this book had been published i just HAD TO HAVE IT!!!! <br />I had heard the rumours of all the drug binges and the abuse, but it's not until you read this book that you realise the lengths that he went to. Being introduced to drugs as a young kid, living with a father who was a dealer and a serial womaniser, wasn't always a great role model for a kid to have. But I got to give it to Anthony, he did good in the end. It was a long journey, but he got there.  <br />As someone who was never into drugs, never took drugs, it helped me understand that desperation, that need to go after that high time after time. It made me realise that sadness yet helplessness of losing a friend to drugs after Hillel died. <br />There are lyrics to songs, and explanaitions as to how songs came about. This book is so incredibly loaded with facts, it's hard to believe that Kiedis could remember so much of his life, seeing as he was loaded for most of it. <br />This book was a brave move for an ex-addict to make, nobody likes to be labelled, and i think he made that balance pretty well. In my eye, he's not an ex-addict, he's not a good guy, he's  not a bad guy, he's a survivor! and the music lives on to Rock another day. <br />To say that this book is a page turner doesn't do it justice! <br />Definitely 10/10  <br />Kudos Kiedis on an excellent warts and all, tell all book that has kept me riveted from front to back. <br />
B0002KVUKM|3.0|Van Helsing is a combination between fantasy, action, a soap opera, mystery, and way to much overacting by the characters.  <br /> <br />Hugh Jackman gives a sort of serious look at a man that has a face that says, \\"I'm going to shoot first, shoot again, shoot some more, and then when everything is dead and full of bullets try to bring them to justice.\\"  <br /> <br />He is sort of like a mid century bounty hunter for all the monsters you hear about in stories that are under your bed or live in creepy castles in strange lands surrounded by woods filled with even stranger creatures. Dont worry, there are plenty of those scenes in here as well. <br /> <br />His first few scenes have him fighting Mr. Hyde, a huge massive \\"Man\\" that still has enough class to smoke a cigar even though he is half naked and likes to eat people. [It only gets better from there]  <br /> <br />Some of the action scenes are alwright, it doesn't tend to stick to huge explosions that blow anything up, thats not till later, but untill then there are still plenty of loud noises and dizzying jumps off of walls and over buildings to keep us entertained. <br /> <br />The Main story sticks to that a generation of vampire hunters have failed to kill the main man himself, Dracula. It is now down to two family members, a brother and a sister [played by Kate Beckinsale, yeah!] They have to kill Dracula before they kill them or none of the deceased family members cant enter heaven.  <br /> <br />Van Helsing goes to Transylvania with a monk [technically he continues to remind us he is a monk in training] to help them. <br />From there the story goes almost nowhere at times, from hunting a werewolf, who turns out to be the brother of the family, to learning of the fact that Dracula has thousands of kids who he wants to set loose and rule the world. <br /> <br />But there is still certain moments that certainly werent boring, I found myself actually liking several of the comedy relief moments, most of them come from the \\"Monk.\\" And although Hugh Jackman tries his best to bring out Van Helsing to the best of his abilities, I saw that most of the time Hugh only spoke maybe three or four lines before he fired his guns. <br /> <br />And the main reason for me that brought the movie down was the completely unnecessary overacting by Dracula's three wives. I swear, half the time they were screaming after one of them was killed or when their babies were killed, [Sorry I ruined it if you were curious about Dracula's kids] and it was completely annoying. <br /> <br />Now despite the bad things, and there were a fair share of them, this is definately okay to watch everyonce in a while. I seriously couldn't stand the screaming by the female vampires, but maybe some of you can tolerate it better than me.  <br /> <br />Whether you can or cant there are lots of great scenes of other action and a showdown between Dracula and a werewolf, and its not the brother of Kate Beckinsales character.

B0002OOUP0|2.0|aka \\"Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo\\" ... sorry, but you just can't cover this era without that. The outdated and out-of-print _Rewind_ still stands as a better collection than this.

B0002858YS|4.0|The Killers, like Franz Ferdinand, has also come out with a really strong and good debut.  Sure, there is a bit of a formulaic approach to it, but only with some of the songs.    Most of them stand out on there own though such as \\"Somebody Told Me\\", there first radio hit.  Now \\"Mr. Brightside\\" may seem a bit clich but it's still good.  My personal favorite is \\"Andy You're A Star.\\"  This song seems a bit ostentatious at first, but the chorus mellows it down a lot, and it becomes more than just mildly pleasing by the end.    I'm not saying they're the greatest, but they are pretty good. (Maybe it's the fact that they sound European but are from Las Vegas)
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Collateral is an action packed movie thriller which succedes in being fairly entertaining.   The acting in this movie is exceptionally good and the Director Micael Mann does a swell job.  Overall Collateral is a movie you should watch if you like action mixed with acting that makes up for the mediocer plot of A hitman riding around LA in a Taxi.   To me this movie was a typical \\"good movie\\". <br /> <br />What makes up for some slow parts in the script, is the way-cool gun shooting scene in a night club and basically all the stops in which Vincent (Tom Cruise) stops in his attempts to carry out his lifestyle of killing. <br /> <br />Collateral is a descent movie that is worth watching. <br />
0765310015|1.0|This book was a big disappointment.  The author has excellent technical writing skills which I feel were wasted on a plot which was trite at best and incoherent at worst.  The characters were predictable and shallow - by the end of the book I was so bored and annoyed I didn't care if any of them lived or died.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Now, I don't buy CDs that often because, as a \\"growing older\\" teen, I have other things to spend my money on (car, gas, college...ect.) But I had some cash from Christmas so I decided to buy this CD...and I was completely blown away! This is an amazing CD! This basically targets any teenager...and most of the lyrics relate to any problem that we go through. I listened to it with my Mother who hates the music that I listen to, and even she was impressed. The music is clean and the lyrics are meaningful. This is buy far one of the best purchases I have ever made. So if you are a potential customer reading this and other reviews, don't listen to the people dissing this CD and the music because, if you are into this kind of music, you will have the CD on repeat for the next month....I promise you that.

0060545682|3.0|La narracion es placentera y veloz para el lector. La voz es optimista a pesar de su cornucopia de penas (el golpe militar; la muerte de su hija; el destierro; divorcio; etc.) No abundan las innecesarias ornamentaciones y descifra las melancolias e  inseguridades causadas por la complejidad de su pasado. <br />Allende sostiene y siente el hibridismo que afecta a muchos Hispanos en los Estados Unidos. Es decir, ella logra concretar la nostalgia que sentia por su pais que ya no es suya y acepta cierta marginacion en un pais anfitrion al cual no esta totalmente acostumbrada. Esto compartimos muchos hispanos. Ni de alli ni de aca. Allende nos lleva con ella a Chile de una manera sencilla y personal. La honestidad de los alagos y de las criticas de sus paisanos es sincera y muchas de estas caracteristicas se pueden aplicar a los demas habitantes de America del Sur en gringolandia. El paralelo del Golpe Militar y el 11 de sept., es lo que empuja a Allende a encontrar cierta definicion que se universaliza para cualquier inmigrante en cualquier pais.
B000002AGN|5.0|There's 131 reviews here as I write this and I'm sure many of them are from Jazz-lovers who can tell you all about this record's challenging time signatures and it's place in the history of jazz and things like that.<br /><br />As an ignorant rocker who just knows what I like and that's all when it comes to Jazz, I just want to say that this is a stone cold classic from start to finish.  \\"Take Five\\" is one of the coolest songs ever written, and \\"Blue Rondo\\" isn't far behind.<br /><br />When I was a teenager back in the 70's, listening to Pink Floyd and Genesis and the Who, I used to raid my Dad's jazz collection when I got bored with my own records, which is how I came to be aquainted with this great record and many, many more.  I've loved Time Out ever since.<br /><br />I think that just about everyone would love \\"Time Out,\\" it's just one of those timeless classics like Miles Davis \\"Kind of Blue\\" that transcends jazz boundries.  A true work of art, yet wildly entertaining.  Five stars +++
0385507755|1.0|Pure garbage. I can't believe they tried to pass this off as non-fiction. The only part I actually bought was the author's impotence; the rest of the book is macho overcompensation for this genital malfunction. Boring, with laughably bad prose and cliched characters that the author actually expects his readers to believe are based on real people, which is insulting. I can't believe this moron had the nerve to compare himself to Dave Eggers in an interview.  <br /> <br />Frey is an example of a spoiled, rich brat who used his parents' money and connections to have his crap published. See Tiffany Debartalo's 'God-Shaped Hole' for another example of a mind-bogglingly terrible novel published because the \\"writer\\" has rich parents. It's an alarming trend.

B0001BKAEY|3.0|People who critisize this film are right to. However what everybody is doing is not watching it PROPERLY. You are SUPPOSED to watch Matrix Reloaded; then IMEDDIATELY after watch this. It's the same kind of deal with Kill Bill: both Kill bill and the two Matrix sequels were supposed to be one long movie.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album first of all, was never going to happen.  It was stolen mid-way through and featured songs that Green Day was prestigious for.  This new album has show how much more mature they have gotten since their Dookie days.  Most people have heard \\"Blvd. of Broken Dreams\\" and \\"American Idiot\\" on the radio, and not much else.  I'm here to tell you about each song.  A lot of this album is in sections, because Green Day, when starting over, starting writing 30 second segments, until they eventually got a rock opera.  The whole CD runs smoothly, and I'll basically tell you about each song.<br /><br />American Idiot - Don't judge the CD based on this CD.  The rest of the CD sounds nothing like this.  This song is somewhat like their older stuff, but not very good.  The lyrics are pretty good, and kind of dis at all the things that we as Americans take for granted and make us stupid.  This song was just average. ~7.5/10~<br /><br />Jesus of Suburbia - This song is incrdibly intersting.  It is over 9 minutes long, and in 5 parts.  They are kind of political and religious, but also kind of sad.  It kind of starts off the tone of the rest of the CD about a kid named Jimmy who seems to be at a cross roads.  Each part is very catch and well written.  He kind of lashes out at the end, and gets you pumped.  This song transitions so many times, and each time you think its a new song, but is one of my favorites despite that.  ~9.0/10~<br /><br />Holiday - this starts are really good, but kind of turns out differently.  It isn't another long song, but sounds good none the less.  This sounds almost nothing like classic Green Day, but is still a great song.  Once again very well written and a little political (kind of hidden).  Not one of the better songs on the album, but still great.  ~8.5/10~<br /><br />Boulevard of Broken Dreams - I haven't heard a Green Day song this good since Good Riddence.  This is definately my favorites song on the album.  Its so relatable to everyone, and is great to listen to when you are feeling down.  It is an anthem to anyone who feels lonely and sad inside, and wish they had someone to \\"walk\\" with.  FANTASTIC song.  ~10/10~<br /><br />Are We Waiting - This song is kind of slow but pretty damn good.  Its a little slower than \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" but also good to listen to when your down.  Its about being \\"lost\\" within yourself, and trying to find something to keep you going.  I like this song, but a lot of people I know didn't like it.  This song is kind of an aquired taste type thing.  ~8.5/10~<br /><br />St. Jimmy - A great transition to something a little faster.  Very Green Day.  Not very corky, but fast and has a lot of guitar, and fast drum in the back.  This song isn't written as good, but does kind of tell you about Jimmy, most representative, but you will get the point.  This is a fun song, and Green Day fans will love this.  ~9.0/10~<br /><br />Give Me Novacaine - One of the best written songs I've ever seen.  Everyone has experienced a time when they were at the lowest, and this embraces that.  Its both slow and fast, but very different from Green Day.  The song is about how you deal with your pains (mentally and physically) and how eventually Jimmy eventually needed novacaine to get rid of this pain.  ~9.0/10~<br /><br />She's A Rebel - Very Green Day once again.  Not greatly written, but fast and gets you going after having a slow song before it.  Its very catchy, and has a lot of guitar, and not that much vocal.  Its still a great song, but not one of the best.  ~8.0/10~<br /><br />Extraordinary Girl - Starts of VERY slow, and then sound a little Arabian.  This song is relatable (mostly to women) but not that great.  The writting is pretty good, but I still have to give it a decent/good score instead of a great score.  ~8.0/10~<br /><br />Letterbomb - I liked this song; it was pretty fast song, but not too fast.  The writing is very good, but took me a while to get it.  It kind of went back to its theme after stepping off for a couple of tracks.  This song is kind of a cross roads for Jimmy, and one of the better songs on the album.  ~9.0/10~<br /><br />Wake Me Up When September Ends - a slow, slow song, but very good.  This song seems kind of emotional, and kind of depressing.  The songs one of the best written songs on the CD, and shows how much Billy has grown up since his Dookie days.  He seems to have been through a lot more, and kind of open his heart for this song.  This is one of the best songs on the album  ~9.5/10~<br /><br />Homecoming - Starts off slow, but picks up after about 45 seconds, but never gets really intense.  The songs is very well written, is kind of shows how St. Jimmy should be remembered with praise.  This is a long long song.  Another song over 9 minutes.  It has a lot of styles in it, but somehow comes together.  This one isn't as organized as Jesus of Suburbia, but just as good.  ~9.0/10~<br /><br />Whatshername - This song is kind of disappointing for the last song of the album, but pretty good.  The song is written pretty good, but not very catchy.  The song does give off a lot of emotion from Billy, but I never really enjoyed it.  This song is just good.  ~8.0/10~It kind of went back to its theme after stepping off for a couple of tracks.  This song is kind of a cross roads for Jimmy, and one of the better songs on the album.  ~9.0/10~ <br /> <br />Wake Me Up When September Ends - a slow, slow song, but very good.

B00005JMYI|1.0|I rented this movie over New Years weekend.  It was so bad I fast forwarded it in parts to get to the end to see what happens. I didn't think most of it was funny . I thought it was a comedy as it was advertised as such.  There might be a couple lines you could laugh at. I would not recommend it for anyone under the teen years.  Some of the comedy revolves around sex and attitudes. Over all I believe I wasted my rental fee and I am glad I didn't buy the movie.
B00003CXXS|4.0|Although this is the third film in the Jurassic Park series, it is still quite entertaining. I believe this movie stands on it's own, as a good action film. Yes, the awe and wonder of seeing the dinosaurs on film for the first time is gone, but JP3 has some good things going for it. First of all, this movie's running length is not overly-long (it's only 90 minutes). Second, although it is an action film, it manages not to take itself too seriously (and even has refreshingly humorous moments throughout the movie). And finally, the filmakers have added some new dinosaurs to the mix, in this film, in addition to making them look even more realistic (technology has greatly improved since the first flick 12 years ago, and it shows). The actual plot is not bad either, but people are ultimately more interested in the quality of the dinosaur action sequences, and they deliver quite a bite (no pun intended).

B00006AUIG|5.0|I read about this one in an issue of \\"All Hallows\\" magazine, and decided to take a look... I was impressed enough to buy a copy after renting it!       Low budget flick, that I think was direct to DVD.  Too bad, I'd like to see this one on a big screen.  I had reservations at first, since I think David Caruso is a bonehead, but he turned in a great performance, along with the rest of the cast, much to my surprise.  The real star however, is the location.       Filmed in an actual abandoned lunatic asylum, this is the scariest damn building I think I've ever seen.  You couldn't pay me enough, or even buy me enough beer to spend a night in this place(and I DO love my beer)!!       The story builds slowly to a fascinating climax.  As someone else stated, there is not a lot of gore, but that's fine with me.  What gets to you is a gradually increasing aura of dread at what you don't see (for kind of the same effect, check out the original 1960 film version of \\"The Haunting\\").  This is a slow and relatively subtle film that really pays off.       Oddball camera work, a chilling score, believable (if sometimes irritating!) characters and an incredible location all add up to a winner.  I do recommend viewing this film at least twice however, as it has what I call a \\"What the fxxk\\" ending.  A second viewing is definitely worthwhile, as a lot of missed details reveal themselves that really clear things up (a bit!).  Finally, watch this one alone in a dark room for maximum effect, as this is an intelligent horror film that deserves all the attention and \\"atmosphere\\" you can give it.  I wish they made more of 'em like this!

B0002ZDVEU|1.0|Yes, I really did like the movie. Fast paced and Matt Damon did a good job of continuing the 'creation' of the 'movie' Bourne. But I have never liked the fact that movies vary a lot from their original books. In this case there isn't a similarity. It's almost sad. There is nothing in the movie that resembles the book - it's totally different. So much so that the Ludlum estate should demand that Damon's picture be taken off of the present release of the book, and maybe even demand that the name of the movie be changed. To say that this is the story written so masterfully by Robert Ludlum is a gross misrepresentation... (And the book is MUCH better).

B0001CCXZW|5.0|I started watching Gilmore Girls when I was two months pregnant.  I had something in common with Lorelei Gilmore.  I was young and I was pregnant.  I looked to the show for inspiration while I went through the lonely weeks of pregnancy.  She was strong, she made it, and Rory was healthy and intelligent.<br /><br />Now my son is six months old and I'm still watching the show faithfully.  I started watching the show in the middle of the 4th season and became really curious on what the first few seasons were about.  I decided to purchase the first season on DVD.<br /><br />I was not disappointed by the DVD.  I really wish there were more extras.  It did seem like there was an odd \\"echoing\\" quality to the audio at times which became jarring.  However, any Gilmore Girls fan knows that nothing matters except the story.  And what a fine story it is.<br /><br />Lorelei Gilmore was 16 years old when she became pregnant and delivered a healthy baby girl.  In her delirius state, she decided to name her daughter afer herself -- Lorelei Gilmore.  Shortening the name, her now-16-year-old daughter goes by the nickname Rory.  The show explores the mother-daughter relationship of Lorelei and Rory as well as their relationship with the outside world.  Lorelei, a coffee-aholic and non-cooker, spends most of her eating hours at \\"Luke's\\", a diner.  Luke is a grouchy man, but has a lot of charm.  Lorelei spends her working hours at the Independence Inn, where she rose from a lowly maid to the manager, second only to the owner.  There we explore a relationship with Michel, a French.. well.. jerk, and Lorelei's best friend Sooki!  Sooki is an accident waiting to happen, but good hearted and loving.<br /><br />On the other hand, Lorelei's parents aren't so good hearted or loving.  At least, on the surface they aren't.  Emily Gilmore is a control freak who desires to run her daughters life.  Richard Gilmore is a Top Dawg at some company where he makes beaucoup money.  While Lorelei lives a middle class life, her parents are upper class.<br /><br />There are a lot more tangles and subplots to this fascinating story.  And, if I was willing to name my daughter after Lorelei, then shouldn't you at least check it out?  :)ives a middle class life, her parents are upper class. <br /> <br />There are a lot more tangles and subplots to this fascinating story.

B0006A9FKA|4.0|Shaun of the Dead, Edgar Wright's parody of the zombie sub-genre of motion pictures, does almost everything right.  It is a comedy with a heart, and more importantly, a great and consistent idea of what it is spoofing, (an element missing in other spoofs, such as parts of the Scary Movie films).  If you are at all familiar with zombie films, you will be laughing from the first scene to the last, and although the film is not a laugh-a-minute (it is a bit more serious than the trailers made it out to be), it offers up enough pokes and prods at other zombie films to keep even the most die-hard zombie fan entertained. <br />  Shaun works in an electronics store, lives with two roommates in London, one of which is his best friend Ed, whom, despite trying hard to keep people happy always seems to wind up disappointing instead.  Shaun's girlfriend Liz breaks up with him, since his life does not seem to have a direction, and he spends all his nights at the pub in town, the Winchester.  Overnight, however, a virus spreads like wildfire through the streets of London, and people become zombies left and right.  Shaun takes it upon himself to save his mother, Ed, and Liz and her two roommates. <br />  The movie, (whose title, an obvious spoof on George Romero's \\"Dawn of the Dead\\", the secon in his zombie trilogy [soon to be a quadrilogy]), knows its influences well.  There are more than a couple homages to Romero's work, from newsreporters uttering famous lines from \\"Night of the Living Dead\\", to Ed screaming \\"We're coming to get you Barbara!\\" on the telephone to Shaun's mother, Barbara. <br />  Zombie regulars will also find references to the Evil Dead trilogy, a subtle but hilarious poke of fun at Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, and more. <br />  From the social satire in the beginning and end, (suggesting people behave like zombies anyway), to the countless horror references, to the creative zombie gore, this movie is a must see for zombie fans.
0156027321|3.0|The story sets off nicely. I like the author's way of thinking and he seems to have an amazing understanding of animal psychology. I also liked the references on religion. But that was until half of the book. After that nothing new adds in and the end is really disappointing.
B000001FGG|5.0|In the last sixties this overwhelming album turned around the clock in the search of new expression possibilities . The legendary pioneer besides Cream was Vanilla Fudge .<br /><br />Theis innovative trio composed for three virtuosi every one in his respective instruments caused souch level of admiration all over the world as any other previous band . Just think in Clapton in the guitar , Jack Bruce in the bass and Ginger Baker in the drums .<br /><br />Having watched the Cream must have been an astonishing experience in those experimentation phase .<br /><br />The incredible rhythms emanated from this trio still are subject of study for the newcomers bands . Consider the breathtaking and original proposal White Room with such allusive and even disturbing ; the legendary song Born under a bad sign that drew dark precognitions about  Vietnam and the not less suggestive piece Desert cities of the heart .<br /><br />The secret of their success was the integrated sound based in the conjunction and not in the protagonist of any special figure . The sound was the final product of exhilarating and fevered rhythms . Bruce in his fierce attacks , the ineffable and always Baker and the imaginative riffs and solos of Clapton .<br /><br />The Live Concert in Fillmore is simply amazing . Spoonful is a heart-rending piece .<br /><br />And Toad is the jewel of the crown the harmonica solos and the drumbeats of Baker make of this album an indispensable item for any hard rock fan or even serious rock investigator .
B0006A9FKA|5.0|A directly humorous attempt, that is, the humans are the source of most of the comedy instead of the zombies. They did not make it a spoof on the genre itself (such as in the Return of The Living Dead series) as much as they tried to make the human cast funny. They were mostly successful if you're hip enough to zombie movies to get the jokes, probably a little less if you are not. I can't imagine that you would buy or rent a movie with this title if you are not a zombie fan, though. <br /> <br />In these days of turbo charged arcade undead it was nice to see old fashioned slow moving zombies the way Zombie-God Romero intended. This movie's twist on the classic genre seems to be to demonstrate that we really aren't all that different from zombies in many ways. If you watch closely you will see several scenes where the human characters resemble the zombies in gestures and manners.  <br /> <br />The DVD has many additional features beyond the movie. They were hit and miss with entertainment quality. The film production documentary stands out as a highlite. <br /> <br /> <br />**spoiler:         I liked how the zombies were not even noticed for a while in the film. That's was a nice touch.** <br /> <br />
B0004Z33G4|3.0|For some reason Artisan/Lions Gate deems it necessary to release their hit films again, again...and again on DVD. This is the third time that the Rambo trilogy has been released! The first releases were slim discs with no features. Then they relased the \\"special editions\\" of each film which you could get seperately or altogether in a really nifty metal case. Just when you thought it couldn't get any better than \\"special edition\\", then comes the \\"ultimate editions\\" of the films. Enough is enough! If I were a die hard fan I would be majoryly P.O.ed that I would have to keep rebuying the series. Luckily I am not a die hard fan and I didn't have to have the films right away so I was able to pick up the Ultiamte Editions. It's not only the Rambo films. Artison has released Terminator 2 and Stargate on 3 seperate occasions! WFT...instead of remastering these films for the billionth time, how bought putting more effort into your back catolouge as your releases of Fright Night 2, DeepStar Six, Bride of Re-Animator, and Fortress look terrible.
0671027387|3.0|No use repeating things already covered in a previous 300 reviews.<br /><br /> I'll add one observation about a gimmick Dan Brown uses way too often....he ends a significant number of chapters with \\"My God !!!\\". In fact he uses that phrase too often throughout the story. A cheap way to keep the excitement up I guess the theory goes. But Mr. Brown uses this gimmick for even inappropiate situations. He'll end a chapter with a character seemingly in shock at seeing something undescribed, \\"My God !!!\\". Oh what can it be !??  Then in the next chapter we discover that the character had merely glimpsed a helicopter, or even a large tent in one scene.....hardly worthy of a \\"My God !!!\\". Just try going through a day in your own life exclaiming \\"My God!!!\\" at every event. A traffic light....\\"My God !!!\\". A cup of coffee...\\"My God !!!\\". You get the point. Tiresome isn't it ? Give it a rest Mr. Brown.
B00006RINF|5.0|Lacuna Coil is an amazing and very impressive band.. Cristina's voice will amaze you. The band is very good, but it really is the vocals that drive this CD. This is one of those CDs you can play on repeat and you don't have to skip a single song. My only criticism would be their lyrics... they are cryptic and enigmatic, atleast in English. If this is a translated CD from Italian, then it is easily justified. Some of Lacuna Coil's cryptic lyrics cross the line from deep and meaningful to woeful strings of big depressing words. But this comes with most bands of this genre of music, right? Haha. <br />And really, as much as all of you would love to compare Lacuna Coil to Evanescence, you can't. Evanescence has their own amazing sound and Lacuna Coil has its own unique style. They don't sound at all alike, in my opinion, so I don't know how you are comparing them. If you want to compare them to Evanescence, I suggest you go find bands like Snake River Conspiracy and Nightwish, and go compare Lacuna Coil to them too. Just because its a rock/industrial/goth band with a female lead singer doesn't mean they are all the same and copying off each other. <br />1.Swamped 5/5- A great opener to a cd. It doesn't really show off Cristina or Andrea's vocals but it really sets the mood and tone of the cd.<br />2.Heaven's a Lie 5/5- This was their &quot;hit&quot;.  Very dramatic vocals and drumming....impressive! One of my faves.<br />3.Daylight Dancer 4/5- Another impressive show of Andrea's voice, but I didn't like the lyrics. It crossed the line I talked about before. Cristina's chorus is very good<br />4.Self Deception 5/5- the haunting sound of Cristina's voice at the beginning is absolutely amazing!! A very vocals driven song...very heavy. Cristina really carries this song along<br />5.Aeon 2/5- I love the guitar. Until it sounded like my stereo started skipping badly. Then after several downloads i realized that this has been done on purpose. The song is short and kind of pointless... Cristina's voice isn't even really pushed in this one. I think its an attempt at a ballad...anyways, don't like it.<br />6.Humane 5/5- very interesting synthezier sounds going on here. You can hear the European techno coming through in this song. Along with the always-amazing vocals, its another fave of mine.<br />7.Tight Rope 4/5- one of their heaviest songs, very good but sounds similar to other songs on the cd.<br />8.The Ghost Woman and the Hunter 5/5- nice melodic intro and a bit slower of a song. Definetely the most &quot;gothic&quot; of the cd...very good!<br />9.Unspoken 5/5- I was impressed with these lyrics... more understandable. And you can hear what Cristina is saying, definetely a bonus!<br />10.Entwined 4/5- I really like the overlapping vocals in this one. Very interesting sound!<br />11.The Prophet Said 4/5- another heavy song but sounds similar to some songs on the cd. Still a good one!<br />12.Angel's Punishment 5/5- the music is soo good in this song. The synthesizer and Cristina's voice are amazing! One of my favourites!<br />13.Comalies 5/5- a great finisher to a CD, and if this CD hadn't come with a song with Italian lyrics, i would have been dissapointed! Good lyrics too...the english part of it!<br />There you go!
068987474X|2.0|I bought this because it was \\"all the rage\\" expecting some real advice or new information about men but this was basically common sense.It is very FUNNY!! But if you REALLY want to know how to attract and keep a man \\"Why Men Love Bitches\\" can't be beat! I have read numerous \\"relationship books and I agree with most of what this book says-don't pursue men, but there must be some stupid women out there isf they can't take the hint that a man is not \\"into them\\" when the man never calls, or only calls during the week, etc. <br />I mean it isn't rocket science to realize when you are doing all the work and he is barely participating.Someone mentioned \\"The Rules\\" on here and though it seems archaic at times -it is very true in most instances (maybe not the never calling men or the \\"timer\\") but seriously men are natural hunters and like to pursue.No one wants a dead deer thrown on their doorstep-what fun is that?Yet women do this everyday !! They call, email and pursue and then wonder WHY the man runs away? <br />It was an amusing book but not good concrete advice for how to CHANGE your habits or attract men.It did not deserve all the media attention in my opinion-it is light,funny but common sense.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|As others have stated, there isn't much for me to add to the wonderful and accurate sentiments already expressed.  But because the concert is so good, I feel compelled to be a part of the community and add some comments.  <br /> <br />This is the best concert captured in video and audio I've ever seen and heard.  It is a beautiful production, capturing the essence of the emotional feeling that is embodied in all of the musician's performances. <br /> <br />Playing the DVD in 5.1 Dolby, I feel like I was there, it sounds so good. Jeff Lyne is a master technician and captured the audio perfectly. I was not familiar with David Leland prior to this, but I am very impressed.  <br /> <br />All the musicians play and sing wonderfully.  It's an absolute masterpiece. I think we are all fortunate to be around to know and love the Beatles and the music of that age and genre. Hearing this concert has rekindled emotions in me that have been buried by the muck and mire of current events.  I'm so glad to have been \\"enlightened\\" again.

B0000931QA|5.0|On every album up until this point, Queensryche has evolved. Starting out as a fantasy metal band, progressive tendencies were slowly added to their sound over the next five years. Now Queensryche has emerged as a \\"thinking man's metal\\" band with a concept album. A concept album is an album where each of the songs plays a part to tell a story, dictated over the entire album. Queensryche's sound is most accurately described as a mix between Pink Floyd and Iron Maiden.<br /><br />The storyline is about a man who has had enough of governmental conspiracy and corruption. He joins and is later brainwashed by a cult that kills off different leaders from the era. He and his partner, a nun who was formerly a prostitute, work together to do what they think will make the world a better place. They receive orders to kill off people and the partners are successful, but the man is eventually asked to kill his partner as a final test of faith. He refuses, and you will have to listen to the rest of the album to find out how the album plays out. Many emotions are explored, including anger, disgust, deceit, and there's even a love story sprinkled in.<br /><br />What makes this album's songs different from other concept albums' songs is the amount of full songs. There are several instrumentals, but they serve as introductions to the following songs. After a spoken intro where the man recalls his story, the album goes into \\"Anarchy X/Revolution Calling,\\" and then \\"Operation Mindcrime\\" for a strong beginning to the album. Next comes \\"Speak,\\" and \\"Spreading the Disease\\" both with strong choruses and great vocal harmonies by Geoff Tate. \\"The Mission\\" starts out slow and quiet, then \\"BAM!\\" it quickly picks up and is another great song, with an unforgettable chorus. \\"Suite Sister Mary\\" is decent but goes on too long. \\"Breaking the Silence\\" is one of the album's best songs, with more great vocal harmonies by Tate. \\"I Don't Believe in Love\\" was the big single off of the album, which received significant airplay on MTV. \\"Eyes of a Stranger\\" is one of Queensryche's best songs ever. Tate delivers a great performance and this is the highlight of the album, you can really hear the influence of Pink Floyd on the solo. The bonus tracks are disappointing though. Although a live version of \\"The Mission\\" is nice, why would they include a live version of \\"My Empty Room?\\" All it is are some screamed vocals and a clock in the background. That second bonus track is disappointing, but the remastering for the album is excellent.<br /><br />In case you didn't figure it out before, Tate does an outstanding job on vocals with great harmonies in every song, it is incredible the way he his vocals can add so much emotion to each song. DeGarmo's solos are just icing on the cake, although I do have a problem about the way that they sound; it isn't the clean metallic guitar heard on \\"Empire,\\" but I do not know enough about guitars to understand what may have caused this. I have to say that this is one of the greatest concept albums of all time, but the group, Savatage, probably holds the greatest one (they actually have several really good ones).

B000002G6J|5.0|From CLAUS OGERMAN by Gene Lees: \\"But he became best known and respected for a series of albums with Jobim. These amounted to far more than arrangements of the Jobim songs. This was a remarkable collaboration whose precedent, really, is that between Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn, and it's hard to know where Jobim ends and Claus begins ... Tommy [LiPuma] is awed by the way Claus writes unison string lines that are somehow perfect. It sounds like a simple thing--after all, the violins are playing the same lines. But there is always something eerily beautiful about those lines.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Eerily beautiful\\" is an exact description of the crescendoing strings at the end of LOOK TO THE SKY. And at the very end you hear a brief piano passage played by Jobim himself.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I cannot believe this movie has an average rating of 4.5 stars.  It doesn't deserve any.  So many people recommended this movie to me, so i finally rented it.  Everyone said this movie is full of \\"dry, sarcastic humor,\\" which i love.  However, this movie had NOTHING LIKE THAT AT ALL.  This was one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my entire life.  It's so bad i don't even know what to say.  There are literally about 2 funny parts in the entire movie, and they are barely funny enough to elicit a chuckle.  The movie is sooo slow.  There were probably 7 or 9 scenes in the movie where at the end of them, i just wanted to scream out \\"WHAT THE #@$*%@ WAS THAT?!?!\\"  One example would be a scene that is about a minute or two long that consists of napoleon sitting in a truck waiting for his uncle.  He looks at his watch.  Then they show the truck for about 10 seconds.  Then they show napoleon's goofy face.  Then they show the inside of the truck for a while.  Then he looks at his watch again.  This goes on, in complete silence, for way too long, and there are so many pointless \\"filler\\" scenes in this movie that i started to think the entire movie was pointless filler.  Then i realized that it was.  I actually fell asleep about 1 hour 10 minutes into the movie, and i wasn't even tired, i think it was my body's way of shutting down to keep me from seeing anymore of this awful movie.  I woke up about 10 minutes later with plenty of time to catch the worthless corny ending. <br /> <br />Napoleon is an awkward nerdy kid that has the typical \\"duh, of course i knew that, you idiot\\" adolescent attitude.  The entire movie consists of him making comments with as much or less substance than the one i just created to describe him, and these are supposed to be the funny parts.  Literally, that's all you get.  He doesn't have many friends at school, he befriends a mexican student, and he has a weird uncle that sells tupperware and an older brother that has an online girlfriend.  Themexican student ends up running for class president.  The hilarity ensues. <br /> <br />Seriously, I am at a loss as to why so many people think this movie is funny.  It probably has something to do with the fact that there hasn't been a decent comedy movie written in years.  I lost respect for a lot of friends' taste in movies after seeing this.  As for the amazon rating, maybe all the people reviewing it are MTV reps.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie.  If you happen to be unfortunate enough to watch it, then do amazon a favor and come back and give it an honest review.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|For Christmas I asked for and received Firefly. I had never seen a single episode btu because I had heard so many great things about the show and because I am a huge fan of Joss Whedon's other two shows, Angel and Buffy. <br /> <br />At first I thought there was no way this show could live up to the hype. Well, it did. It was the best fourteen hour movie I'd ever seen. Serenity was a tremendous pilot and the characters were fantasically written. <br /> <br />Even though this is a Joss Whedon show, I think the one thing that stood with me was the acting. At times on Buffy and Angel, the acting can get overdramtic and wordy. On this show Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, and Adam Baldwin lead a cast that makes me wonder what the hell FOX was thinking. They can air four seasons of American Idol yet only fourteen episodes of Firefly. What a crock. Anyway for fans of Joss Whedon this is a must and for others, this is what TV should be about.
B0000027RL|5.0|Pearl Jam's Ten is one of few albums that can be listened to from beginning to end without skipping any songs. From the opening firey lyrics of \\"Once\\" to the quite end of \\"Release\\" this album is 100% quality. The musical talent soars through the roof and the vocals are stunning, especially compared to today's baron wasteland of musical talent. With most of today's bands spitting out overused power chords pathetic lyrics and whiny dramatic voices. Ten is put together like a work of art. Each instument speaks to you, and the songs's lyrics make you think. These songs are constructed and have character and depth. If your a fan of music in any way, Ten is for you. If it doesn't already belong to you, it should very soon.
B0002S94OS|5.0|This new Lamb of God disc is in a league of its own !!!! I bought it the day it came out August 31st and listened to it four or five times and that was it. I was not into it for some reason...  HOWEVER, I popped it in recently and it is now safe to say, no one comes close to this band. If you like agressive, heavy, mean and just plain brutally fast music, spend 15 or 20 dollars and buy this CD. Every one in the band sounds great, tight and skilled at what they do.  Also this new LOG offering  is well written.  The only negative aspect, a bit political, but not over the top.     <br /> <br />
B0006B29Z2|4.0|Both DVDs are packed with their own stuff, the first basically has the concerts. They are decent quality considering how old they are, but they are still cool. Disc 2 has a couple of documentaries, its cool to see how Iron Maiden came to be, and to see some of the old members and how OLD they really look.<BR>The ONLY thing I didnt like was that they play a lot of the same stuff in 2 of the concerts, they are almost the same, I just wish they played Strange World live in one of those sets, would have been awesome !!!!
0553278223|5.0|Bradbury has a very interesting approach to sci-fi.  He seems to to place all his stories within the reachable, not completely detatched from real life or the future. (like, ironically, most futuristic sci-fi works are)   <br /> <br />I'd definately recommend this book even to those who are normally uninteresting in sci-fi.  It is short and if you end up not liking it you won't have wasted much time.
0670033375|1.0|An excellent book when it comes to examining the collapse of ancient societies. Less convincing when it comes to drawing parallels with the modern era. Parallels drawn are spurious, with hidden assumptions that must be accepted on faith. As an ode to the religion of Environmentalism, it is well written. As a work of reasoned argument and scientific evidence, it is lacking.
6300271447|5.0|Woodstock was the high point of the late sixties.  It was a time of innocence and pain.  It was a time when we who were young were members of a tribe - we cared for each other and shared visions of a better world.  Yes, there were problems - bad drugs, lack of sanitation, and the like.  But it worked in its time.  The movie captures this mood so well, both in the interviews and in the music.  The multiple frames help to show the different aspects of life at Woodstock so well.  I'm not sure if those who are younger now can truly understand why Woodstock was so important - maybe this film will help them to understand.
0812580346|2.0|Flashforward aspires to be hard science fiction.  Hard SF has one requirement above all others -- the science MUST be internally consistent.  Sawyer's novel fails that test. <br /> <br />The premise is interesting.  For reasons unknown (at the start of the book), everyone on Earth experiences a \\"flashforward\\" of themselves, 10 years later.  Everyone, that is, except for an unlucky few people, including our protagonist, because in 10 years, they will be dead. <br /> <br />Or will they?  The book's fundamental question is whether the future just experienced is inevitable, or subject to change.  Was the world of 10 years hence a world that had, 10 years earlier, experienced a \\"flashforward\\"?  Or was it a hypothetical world that would have been, if flashforward had not occurred? <br /> <br />In the course of the book, Sawyer squarely answers these questions.  But the book's climactic scene, which deals with our protagonist's efforts to escape his inevitable(?) death, rests on a premise that cannot be reconciled with Sawyer's answer.  Sawyer is guilty of sloppy thinking, or sloppy writing.
0312995423|1.0|I stopped reading this book after I found out that one of the main characters, a \\"brilliant\\" cryptographer, was trying to upload a fake copy of a program to replace a real copy on the internet.  Did Dan Brown not consult with any experts?  No one posts a program on the internet of that much importance with out also adding a verification hash.  That is extremely basic internet security.  I have begun MUCH more skeptical about his other books as a results.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|Tom Cruise is a wacky hitman who provides some funny lines between sensless shootings.  I could never get over the fact that it was Tom which I think is the primary job of an actor. I was like 'no wonder Nicole left this goofball' the whole film. Jamie Foxx is excellent except his shift from lifelong cabbie to action hero is as tough to swallow as the superhot prosecutor's interest in dating him. <br /> <br />This movie is way more violent than you might think since it is sort of a comedy.
B00004T8RK|4.0|First, I'll explain why this is my first PJ album, and I didn't get Vs, Ten, or Vitology first. I listened to a Pearl Jam song at my friends house and loved it. Loved it so much I decided to get an album. The problem is, I'm a kid, and my parents aren't too big on songs with lots of cussing. So, I spent hours on the Internet painstakingly looking at the lyrics of every album, song and B-side ever by Pearl Jam. Every album had bad words except this one, so I bought it. It is AWESOME. It was totally worth the $2.00 I paid (used, on this site). It kicks off with 3 rockers, Breakerfall, God's Dice, and Evacuation. The first and the last are excellent, but the middle is my least favorite. Then I get lots more classic Pearl Jam songs; Light Years (which is my favorite), Nothing As It Seems, Thin Air, Grievance, Insignificance, Soon Forget, Rival, Slieght Of Hand, and Parting Ways. Lots of bang for the buck (or two bucks, actually) on this album. It has a very cool futuristic sound to it and the drummer is upgraded, with Matt Cameron from the ashes of Soundgarden. I anticipated the hidden track, and it's, well...pointless. Pearl Jam, with the 4 minutes you stuck on there between Parting Ways and Eddie typing, you could have added in another song (not necessarily a the end) to the album! Oh well. Anyway, later I was burned Ten, being said it was their best album, and I still don't really like as much. It's original, and it has lots of great songs, but it's too derivative. Plus, there's lots of bad words, too, but it's still a very good album. I love Eddie's voice on this album, it's more gravelly than previous albums, and really stands out. Pick this up with Ten, Vitalogy, and Vs. <br /> <br />Breakerfall - 8.5/10 A very good rocker. I make animated cartoons, and I am currently making a Pearl Jam concert, drawing it out and animating it, featuring this song. <br /> <br />God's Dice - 7.5/10 Another rocker, but is my least favorite. Is too mushy. <br /> <br />Evacuation - 9/10 Pure rock n' roll fun with some slow parts, but their best rocker is Spin The Black Circle from Vitalogy. (It's not about drugs, as the first line suggests, it's about  playing a record.) <br /> <br />Light Years - 10/10 I simply adore this song. Is the most listenable and enjoyable. <br /> <br />Nothing As It Seems - 10/10 Another classic PJ song. <br /> <br />Thin Air - 10/10 ANOTHER classic Pearl Jam song! <br /> <br />Insignificance - 9/10 And more of the best! <br /> <br />Of The Girl -7/10 A weaker track, though lots like it the best. <br /> <br />Grievance - 8.5 A very good track. Someone described as \\"cute\\", as I recall... <br /> <br />Rival - 9/10 Starts off with a growling dog. I really like this song. <br /> <br />Sleight Of Hand - 9/10 Really easy to get into. <br /> <br />Soon Forget - 9.5/10 Beautiful 1:00 song. <br /> <br />Parting Ways - 9/10 Somewhat overlong, but great! <br /> <br />Writer's Block - N/A Is pointless, but somewhat symbolic, if those two go together.
1400049628|5.0|This book was one of the funniest books I've read recently.  The writing is so witty and detailed.  I wonder how long it took Max Brooks to write this book.  It's a very quick read (I read it in four days).  The only change I would recommend is to add more \\"historical accounts\\" of zombie occurrences at the end.  Those were great!
0671027387|1.0|It took me a second to remember which dan brown book this was, not that it really matters as they are all incredibly similar but I couldn't even make it through a quarter of this book.<br /><br />Dan Brown's books are considered \\"Smart Thillers\\" which apparently means there is a plot twist, oohhhh
B000002UR7|2.0|Radiohead's debut album \\"Pablo Honey\\" was released in 1993 and was a moderately successful hit. What made this band different from other British bands was that they managed to achieve almost instant success on both sides of the Atlantic. This album arrived in the mid/early-90's amidst a wave of teenage-angst rock pop, other contributors being Nirvana and Alanis Morissette. What this album displays is a rather solid array of standard rock songs with a commercial appeal but not really memorable riffs or hooks. Yes, the album has its high points and indeed it does have its lows, and when compared to the subsequent albums Radiohead would release, it's a downright catastrophe, but come on, people, give it a chance.<br /><br />It's not \\"OK Computer,\\" \\"Kid A\\" or even the sophomore follow-up \\"The Bends,\\" but it only proves the common theory that really talented bands produce their better material at later stages in their career as they develop and evolve their sound over a number of albums. Lead singer Thom Yorke seems under-developed on this album, but this only now serves as a reminder of the genius he would later go on to create.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"You,\\" a melodic and charged rock song with a rather catchy riff but not really very memorable lyrics. The chorus is good but there's not really much more to say about this song. \\"Creep\\" is up next, and is, of course, the best song on the album. This song made the band famous in America with its depressing tale of being different to others. It's incredibly melancholy and yet beautiful at the same time. Yet you still want to grab Yorke by the scruff of the neck and tell him to snap out of it! A superb song, however, definitely one of their greatest ever. \\"How Do You?\\" seems very similar to the kind of music Oasis would experiment with on Definitely Maybe, but as one of the cast-offs. There's a certain catchiness to it, but I think the song lacks lyrical direction: it doesn't seem very focus and the vocals aren't very good. \\"Stop Whispering\\" is a more mellow affair than the previous effort with a melodic guitar section and an overall catchy chorus. The song has a plodding to it that carries it through preventing it from being a total washout.<br /><br />\\"Thinking About You\\" is a bit of a cheesy pop song. It's a softer song than the most on this album and reminds of early Green Day. However, Radiohead were originally marketed as the next Brit-Pop band and this just screams commercialism. \\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\\" is actually a really good song and picks the album up a bit just as it starts to lag. I like the pace of this song because it swaggers and the chorus is very rocking. \\"Ripcord\\" is another average song but it does have a nice change of pace in the verses, but the chorus is ultimately forgettable. \\"Vegetable\\" is another bad song, which doesn't really appeal to me. By this point you'll become rather frustrated with the album, but thankfully \\"Prove Yourself\\" is a bit better. I actually like the verses in this song and the chorus has a quality to it that enables you to sing along to it very well.<br /><br />\\"I Can't\\" has a catchy guitar riff that runs through its chorus but the vocals can hardly be heard because of it. I find this song good but after a few listens it begins to bore me somewhat. \\"Lurgee\\" is an actually very good song, and one of only a couple of songs you may find Radiohead still performing at a concert today. It has a very melodic pace to it and the lyrics seem to actually make sense unlike some others on the album. Yorke's vocals are also strong, which I like. \\"Blow Out\\" is the final song on the album and is another good song. The pace is uptempo and rather tranquil. I like the guitars in the background and the drumming is rather noticeable. Overall it's a good song but not amazing.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 5/10<br /><br />When you listen to the subsequent albums that Radiohead would release, and then compare it to Pablo Honey, there really is no competition. This album is good at best, but for the most part is rather dire and unforgettable. In a way I regret buying this album but I love Radiohead so I suppose it's essential. \\"Creep\\" is the only really memorable song on this album while the rest just seems like commercial fodder. I think I might put \\"Kid A\\" on now and imbue my brain with something intelligent, though-provoking, ground-breaking and emotional. Besides, the cover art to that album is much better than the pouting baby on the cover of Pablo Honey...s no competition.

B0002WYS6S|5.0|It makes me really sad that Dream Theater is one of the most underrated bands in the world. Despite its enormous talent, Dream Theater rarely attract large audiences and this is a paradox.  <br /> <br />This is irrefutably the best live performance I have ever seen. I have seen many live performances but this is my favorite one. All performances by Dream Theater have so far been excellent but this one exceeds all expectations. The reason for this is the impeccable audio quality on this DVD. As always, John Petrucci, John Myung, Mike Pertnoy and Jordan Rudess perform extremely well. You may have noticed that I did not include James LaBrie in this list. I risk making some people angry but I feel the following has to be said. James LaBrie is simply not that good a singer. Given that the other members mentioned above are all extremely gifted musicians, one would expect that the singer be equally or at least almost as good. Unfortunately, this is not the case, LaBrie does not even come close.  <br />I guess what I am trying to say is that Dream Theater would have been much more popular if they had a more competent singer. <br /> <br />Aside from this minor point, this DVD is worth every penny. It is progressive rock at its best! To sum up, this is without a doubt the most impressive live performance to date. In point of fact, words are not enough to describe this unprecedented concert. Add this masterpiece to your DVD collection, trust me you will not be disappointed.
B00005JMYI|1.0|I recently rented this movie because the previews looked very funny...WRONG..the previews, for the most part aren't even in the movie.I've seen some stupidly funny movies in my time, and this is NOT one of them. Only those die-hard Will Farrell fans will appreciate this sad attempt at comedy. Everyone else, if you're thinking of buying this..DON'T..even renting this would be unwise. I don't deny Farrell is talented, but not in this. \\"Anchorman\\" is probably the WORST movie I've seen in a long time.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|Of the three \\"Red Curtain\\" movies, this one's the worst in the lot.  Gone is the sensitivity and intimacy of \\"Strictly Ballroom\\".  Gone is the creativity and re-imagination of \\"Romeo+Juliet\\".  Gone are 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back. <br /> <br />What was everybody thinking on this film?  Ewan MacGregor is so bland you want to salt him.  Nicole Kidman reminded me of those cartoon ostriches in the ballet.  John Leguizamo has never been this annoying, not even in Spawn. <br /> <br />Not only that, but the movie is ugly to look at.  The whole thing's a bloody eyesore.  The editing looked like it was done by a spastic with ADD.  The sets looked like they were done with Crayolas and popsicle sticks.  The lighting gave me a headache. <br /> <br />And then there's the music.  Ho-ly-crap.  Derivitive would be much too kind.  Actually, to call it musical would still be way too kind.  The soundtrack sounds like it was played by a stump-armed monkey on a broken calliope, sung by men and women who obviously gargled with Drano before going into the studio. <br /> <br />If this is what passes for genius in today's modern idiom, I feel sorry for you.  Oh well, one man's fertilizer is another's horse-apple. <br /> <br />You'd be better off spending your money on a big box of Post Toasties.  At least there you get nutritional value...

B00065HKDY|3.0|This was actually better than I thought it would be.  There is a lot to like about the movie, with some heavy messages and very good special effects.  Exactly how did the good scientist who created the robots die, was it suicide or was he murdered and if so by who?  Could it have been robots programmed by a human or are the robots taking over and if so how can that be given the three prinipals that protect humans from harm?<br />This is a well thought out script, my only real problems are with the damn &quot;HOLLYWOOD&quot; moments with the hero flying through the air in slow motion with guns ablazing or the chase scenes with the hero oh so close to falling to his death while leaping to catch a precious object but just barely able to hang on (what a surprise).<br />One of those movies I wish the English had made.  This one is pretty good but a little too sanitized
B0001MDPV8|5.0|Nas hit it on the nail in 1994 with Illmatic!  I played that album several times!  I like the anniversary edition where they put the original 10 songs on one CD and this special one as the second.  I still like Life's A..., The World Is Yours, One Love, that xylophone based song that rocks, New York State of Mind and others.  L.E.S., Large Professor,Pete Rock, DJ Premier, and some others produced some dynamic songs.  But the true star is Nas, as his lyrics are street, his metaphors and cadences and rhymes are on  point, and how he describes life in Queensbridge.  This is still a classic, Nas is one of NY's best rappers and his latest one will be another classic in its own right!

B0006399FS|4.0|Given the dreck to which radio subjected us in 2004, it's easy to overrate U2's \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.\\" The superlative praises by professional critics raise this CD to a standard it simply does not meet. Face it: this is a GOOD, but not great, U2 album. It has its share of filler, and it covers well-worn territory (spirituality, war, death, and so forth) but with slightly less satisfying results. That said, \\"Bomb\\" rocks when Bono, the Edge, Mullen, and Clayton put their minds to it. The kickoff upbeat single, \\"Vertigo,\\" is the strongest track and it projects with full force, while the lovely \\"A Man and a Woman\\" and the memorable \\"Yahweh\\" make strong impressions. It's brief running time of 49 minutes is welcome in an age where lesser artists feel the need to pack in as much material into an 80 minute album as possible. Thankfully, this band realizes that less can mean more. U2 really haven't turned the page on this new album, nor have they revealed anything particularly new. Still, this is a flawed but solid offering that may not win over any new converts, but it won't discourage the faithful, either. Grade: B.
B000002WAD|3.0|I think that Rick Astley's best album was in 1993, his fourth one.  But this debut from 1987 was good.  I liked his remake of O'Chi Brown's 1985 song, Whenever You Need Somebody and that remake didn't even go top 10 or No. 1 in America. It's really my favorite song on the album.  They instead went for the identical No. 1 hits Never Gonna Give You Up and Together Forever, which they played a lot then and still play heavily today. But here's the album's problem when I heard it--every song follows the same Stock-Aitken-Waterman formulaic dance pattern where the singer sounds robotic reading the lyric sheet.  The music still follows this verse-chorus-verse pattern on about every song. They sound like the same songs they did for Kylie Minogue, Bananarama and Donna Summer.  It doesn't allow Rick to show his singing and vocals more.  The 1988 album was just like that too and I can understand why he left S/A/W to produce his own stuff. But this debut made for a good start for Astley as a male artist and one of the best pop singers of the late '80s. He has that Motown soul singing thing going on in a few songs, but that didn't come out until albums 3 and 4.
B000002H97|4.0|Yes, they are.  If you turn to any heavy metal or mainstream rock station you'll probably hear Enter Sandman, The Unforgiven, Wherever I may roam, Nothing else Matters and Sad but True.  This album is mainstream, however, musically it is a classic.  After this album Metallica never recovered.  Nonetheless, you decide!

B00005JN0T|5.0|I cannot say enough about this film! I remember in early 2004 when trailers were released on TV for the film, my first reaction was \\"Man, what a crappy film!\\"  <br />But after reading more about it, I thought the film needed to be given a look; and was I not disappointed! I, personally, would consider this film to be one of the best in 2004 and very underrated. People say it is a special-effects extravaganza. But let me ask those people this question: How else are they going to pull all of that robot and futuristic stuff off? <br />Will Smith is just great in here and the story is one of the best I have seen in many years! The special-effects are great and it just keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire film! <br />This is a film I would recommend to anyone who loves movies! Whether you are a sci-fi fan or not, I am willing to bet, you will find this movie very enjoyable!
B000063DIR|1.0|this, like a LOT of other amazon reviewers, is, was, and always will be my favorite solo ozzy disc. i bought it when it first came out in 1982, and unlike \\"blizzard of ozz\\", i loved EVERY track on the lp! why one star? well, it's because of the desecration of re-recording something w/ new musicians that should never have been tampered with to begin with. by the way, i've noticed that a lot of reveiwers are \\"shocked\\" that ozzy could do this to randy rhoads' memory. and, i too have heard and/or read how much ozzy loved randy like a brother/best friend, etc, etc. it struck me kind of odd whenever i remember seeing ozzy live that year (it was the very last show w/ rhoads, he died the very next day), because i still remember hearing ozzy @ some point in the concert announce that his guitarist was leaving the band after that gig. i've encountered other people over the years that were at that same show, and they also claim too have heard the same announcement. another thing that i only thought of recently, is that if ozzy was SO torn up by randy's death, then why didn't he cancel the concert.?. i remember all too well that he hired guitarist bernie torme and kept right on truckin' down the road, gaining his success not necesarily from the 1st two solo lp's, but more so over the death of randy rhoads--THAT'S what propelled ozzy to superstardom, not his \\"ozzy the apeman\\" antics! by the way, one reviewer on here had a GREAT idea: let tony iommi take the 1st 8 sabbath albums and re-release them with a new vocalist, like tony martin or r.j.dio, or better yet, clay aiken (hey, i know he's a pop idol, but the mother can sing! imagine his voice w/ sabbath's mean music!). anyways, i hope i can eventually find a copy of \\"diary of a madman\\" & \\"blizzard of oz\\" that haven't been touched by sharon. (and that's why it always bothered me when people wanted to slam yoko ono for being such a provocative artist who married a beatle. at least SHE didn't try to get john to remix any beatle albums, and replace paul's vocal tracks w/ hers. yes, the new remixed versions of the 1st two ozzy cd's are that bad!! (and i love yoko, but not as a beatle!). i've always had my \\"suspicions\\" surrounding the fateful plane crash that took randy's life (even though i was never one to hold him in such high regard as a guitarist. he was good. not GOD!) and after reading in one of the amazon reviews that he and sharon had a brief romance in the early 80's, well that kind of fits right in there w/ other motivation. i don't mean to sound all \\"conspiracy theory\\", but, like i said, if oz was really that close to rhoads, you would think that the first thing he'd do would be to cancel any future concert dates; but, that falls under management...get the picture anyone?!?! oh, and when bernie took leave, ozzy STILL kept touring! he brought in brad gillis of night ranger and then proceeded to keep on touring. and don't forget that was also the year that black sabbath finally released an official live album, \\"live evil\\". it was also the same year that petty ozzy HAD to release a double live album of nothing but old sabbath songs, called \\"speak of the devil\\". when i think of what happened to ozzy during that period, and the years that followed, i can sum it up by stating what a travesty! i was a bigger fan of sabbath's, and still am. i just wish that tony iommi would kick the apeman out of the band again (even if it means losing geezer butler) and carrying on with yet a whole new line-up. or bring back glenn hughes! or any number of singers, famous or not. i just wish that iommi would realize that HE'S got his share of fans that think sabbath without ozzy is a better sabbath! \\"blizzard\\" and \\"diary\\" were the only TRUE ozzy ozbourne records released, and now sharon, the wicked witch from who knows where has ruined those. thanks a lot! not!!ums, and replace paul's vocal tracks w/ hers. yes, the new remixed versions of the 1st two ozzy cd's are that bad!!

B000003C5C|5.0|Death was a great metal band.  They sound like a mix of Napalm death and Slayer.  Their solos are good.  I'm so glad I got this album because I truly love their revolutionary sound.  I know these guys influenced many who joined the metal movement.  What a great album.  If you don't own this album then you don't know what heavy metal is!  Chuck's vocals are insane.  The guitar work is really good too!  I like the bass as a good fill in.  The drums add a kick to the music as well.  I wish there were more songs on this album.  Nonetheless, I hope Chuck can rest in peace.  He is an underrated pillar of the history of heavy metal music.

B00005JMX6|2.0|The begining of the film looked diffrent and promising, not your typical high school comedy. As the film goes on you realize it sure isnt your typical high school comedy but it SUCKS! The acting is horrible, the only half decent actor is played by the lead character Emilie Hirsh. What can you expect? The movie is about a porn star living next door. It was definetly worse than I expected and mixes in these stupid messages about love that shouldnt even be in the movie. It dosent even seem realistic, you cant buy it after all you have seen. I didnt see any chemistry at all between the 2 main characters-( the porn star and the kid) then again , maybe it was just bad acting. I dont see how anyone can compare this film to American Pie let alone Risky Business. I am also a big fan of more obscure cult movies but this just wasnt good. I didnt see how it can have much cult appeal either. The first half of the movie starts out with a 18 yr old named Mathew and his 2 friends, one day mathew sees ( the girl next door) and falls in love with her basically, then finds out shes a porn star. WOW. It even gets better from there , he gets into fights with her manager or guy who directs her films the guy steals 25 grand from some stupid club or fund raiser for this foreign kid thats suppoused to come to the school and now the kid has to come up with the money again and guess how he does it? Anyway there are a couple laughs towards the end but thats about it, this film was A DUD. A waste of time. I wouldnt recomend buying this without renting first. - also how this movie got 4 stars is beyond me , i dont know what kind of reviwers would give this dud 4 stars, that is really Misleading to people on here who want to buy a good movie. Ive seen good movies on here with 4 stars that are actually good but to place this one in with them is just nuts/ misleading- ITS 2.5 stars at the most. Buyer Beware. Also please take David Bowies music out of this film. Its an insult.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Let me begin by saying that I am a huge fan of horror-comedies.  I mean, what are two of the strongest humor emotions?  Fear and happiness.  Horror-comedies mix these two elements, and if done correctly - which is no easy feat - you can have one darn fine movie.  And \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is just that.  I've been looking forward to this movie since I first saw it advertised in U.S. theaters, and I can sincerely say that it lived up to the highest of my expectations. <br /> <br />Simon Pegg (who has gained some popularity overseas for performing in the British TV show \\"Spaced\\") stars as Shaun, a 30-year-old Brit who is stock with a crappy job and a crappy stepfather (Bill Nighy), among other things.  Then there's his slacker best friend, Ed (Nick Frost).  When his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) dumbs Shaun, it looks like his life has taken the final step towards hell. <br /> <br />But Shaun is given a chance to win back Liz, as well as fix things up with his mother (Nicola Cunningham) and stepdad.  How?  Simple: he just has to defend them all against a neighborhood full of zombies. <br /> <br />I've always been a fan of movies like \\"Evil Dead II\\", \\"Re-Animator\\", and George Romero's original \\"Dead\\" trilogy.  As a fan, I can say that anyone else who liked those movies will love \\"Shaun of the Dead\\".  The script, by Edgar Wright and star Pegg, knows when to bring in some comedy and when to let loose the horror.  (When it does bring in horror, the casual moviegoer's stomach will no doubt flip - ever seen a man get ripped to pieces right in front of you, while he's still living, and his guts eaten?) <br /> <br />The cast is terrific, Pegg especially.  You care about the characters, and the only one who I didn't care about was ... uh ... dealt with.  Edgar Wright manages to make the film look like a comedy when there's something funny going on, but when there's any horror (especially towards the end of the film), his direction becomes quite dark.   <br /> <br />What can I say?  This is one of the best films of the year, and easily the best horror-comedy in years.  I was entertained throughout the entire film.  Hilarious and absorbing, \\"Shaun\\" is anything but dead.

I was as impressed with the composing of the music scores as I was the heart and soul Ray and the others put into each song. I can't stop playing this album. Thanks to Ray and the artists that made this wonderful piece of work.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is not for everyone, but name a movie that is.  If you're familiar with the pacing of movies like Rushmore, Welcome to the Dollhouse, and Raising Arizona, you will understand the comedy techniques and tempo of the film.  If you enjoy movies like Faceoff and Mission Impossible, keep moving.  The movie's appeal is in it's non-linear approach to capturing the essence of each character from the movie's namesake to the square-peggish female lead to the timid Mexican immigrant.  The scenes are punched up nicely with the includsion of a seasoned-nerd older brother and maudlin, pseudo-sports hero \\"uncle\\". <br /> <br />If you weren't laughing in the first 15 minutes of this rare type of comedy, you're probably better suited with a Jim Carey or Pauly Shore movie.
B00005AQGH|5.0|Not many will disagree that 2Pac is one of if not the best rapper of all time.  I don't know how BIG won out in the Source but so be it.  This CD should be a staple in your collection.  Right along side the classic Dr. Dre-The Chronic and SNoop DOgg-Doggystyle should be this album.  It is tough these days to find an album that can be played all the way through without a few overly weak tracks.  This CD doesn't have that.  Even the Intro has a tight beat but Pac's lyrics and voice take it to a new level.  This CD is pretty old by now, but it needs its props as a staple.  Hail Mary, Toss it Up, Life of an Outlaw top 3.
6300181685|3.0|The Hindenburg, based on the 1972 Michael Mooney book, mixes historical fact with Hollywood drama as it depicts the last voyage of the famous airship. Although it purports to explain how the pride of the Third Reich burst into flames, the truth will never be known.<br />Produced and directed by Robert Wise (The Day the Earth Stood Still, West Side Story, The Sound of Music), the film is one of many all-star disaster pictures made in the 1970's. Wisely, he has chosen to open with original newsreel footage, and concludes with the famous radio broadcast by Herbert Morrison.<br />Screenwriter Nelson Gidding tries hard to make the film a mystery, but it never quite takes off. His scenes revolving around a 'clairvoyant' kook ashore who insists the dirigible will blow up over New York are distracting and hokey. Still, Gidding stays fairly close to the facts and many of the characters are clearly based on real people.<br />George C. Scott gives a committed and credible performance as a government representative with a conscience sent aboard to investigate potential saboteurs. The always radiant Anne Bancroft adds a touch of romance in her portrayal of a Countess fleeing Hitler's regime. Charles Durning is underutilized as Captain Pruss, Robert Clary adds comedy relief as the clownish Joe Spah, while Burgess Meredith and Rene Auberjonois play a couple of card sharps out to bilk their fellow passengers.<br />David Shire's symphonic score is a little overdone, while the art direction wavers between stunning and silly. The disaster sequence was shot in black and white, so that actual footage of the tragedy (clearly identified by the grainier images) could be interspersed with new scenes. And, with so many characters trying to escape, the actual 34-second explosion lasts an exciting 6 minutes. [It is remarkable that only 35 of the 97 aboard died in the horrific melee.]<br />While too much time is spent showing the innumerable suspects creeping about the ship, The Hindenburg is an entertaining film which offers a compelling recreation of life aboard this once popular method of travel. Like the dinosaurs, the age of the zeppelins came and went... Rating: 6 out of 10.

B00005JMYI|2.0|There are some gags that are hilariously funny, but the plot  doesn't hang together. There are too many over-the-top scenes. This strategy works for Mel Brooks, but here Ferrel takes potshots at everything and pretty much misses everything. For example, there is a voice over at the end for a character that is never seen in the movie. Was that intentional and not funny? Or was it unintentional and sloppy editing? The language is bad in spots. Furthermore, there is a lot of yelling in the movie by different characters. I am not sure why that is funny.      The good points were the dog was cute, Steve Carrel as Brick was funny, and some of the cameos were funny. I won't spoil the cameos, because who they got to play which character is part of the fun. Unfortunately, the rest of the scene was not as funny.     The movie just doesn't work for me.
0131177052|5.0|The vast majority of software texts are about greenfield development: creating a new application from nothing at all. But the vast majority of software work involves existing code: adding features, finding bugs, or refactoring code that someone else wrote. This book is a supurb first step in fixing that imbalance. <br /> <br />This is not a theoretical work. For example, Feathers does not present a grand  ontology of legacy systems. Not is this book heavy on methodology. Instead Feathers describes techniques --- lots of techniques, roughly 50 --- for working with legacy code.  <br /> <br />The techniques are organized by the problems they address. For example,  one chapter is entitled \\"My Application Is All API Calls\\" and then presents two techniques for working with existing code that is full of calls to APIs. <br /> <br />Feathers comes from the XP school, and he adopts that school's premise that you can safely change code if (and only if) there are sufficient tests in place to tell you when your new change has introduced a bug. Many of the techniques in this book are about different ways of putting legacy code into test harnesses, and doing that safely without introducing bugs along the way. <br /> <br />He also introduces new concepts, or at least concepts I had never seen before. For example, a \\"characterization test\\" is a test that characterizes the actual behavior of the code, not what the code is supposed to do, but what it actually does. Why is that useful? First, it is an effective way of documenting what a system actually does, particularly if --- as with most legacy code --- there is no other documentation. And it can tell you when you have changed that existing behavior. <br /> <br />Feathers' style is easy to read. As you would expect there is lots of example code here, and it is folded naturally into the explanatory text. My only gripe with the book is with the examples: they are largely in Java, C++, or C. I would have liked some examples in older legacy-only languages, like COBOL. <br /> <br />But overall, this book is simply supurb, a tour de force of an important topic that has received little coverage before.
630587493X|3.0|Bicentennial Man, the latest vehicle for Robin Williams, follows the 200-year odyssey of android Andrew Martin, as he struggles to become human and seek acceptance as one.<br />Not unlike the emotional struggle faced by Star Trek: The Next Generation's Mr. Data, Andrew is faced with fearful humans who refuse to see his impassioned side, and delight in labelling him as a subordinate \\"it\\". Thus, the film briefly touches on the theme of racial intolerance, and the age-old question of what makes a man a man. Andrew is also faced with learning about loss, as the characters he serves all grow old and eventually die.<br />Taking place as it does over two centuries, the story tries hard to match the sweeping grandeur of such films as Forrest Gump and Gone with the Wind, but advances at such sudden intervals that the narrative becomes choppy. This will undoubtedly cause many children to become confused, with the characters pictured at so many progressive periods in their lives.<br />But a children's picture this is not. In fact, Bicentennial Man is too heavy-handed for children, with not too subtle discussions of sperm function and sexual intercourse. Some viewers may also be upset with its pro-euthanasia stance. Further, there are not one, but four death-bed scenes, guaranteed to tug at one's heartstrings. Terms of Endearment from a robot's point of view?<br />The score by James Horner, which at times is reminiscent of his Oscar-winning Titanic theme, swells at all the moments of poignancy, but one can only take so many ups and downs in two hours.<br />Perhaps to lessen the film's fantasy concept and offer viewers something to relate to, a few generational conflicts are thrown in, but these seem misplaced surrounded by so much wonder. Certainly, the film presents a very Utopian vision of the future, and is visually quite attractive. From sumptuous sets to imposing matte paintings of cityscapes and futuristic (but not over-done) clothing, there is surprisingly minimal gadgetry.<br />But why is that Hollywood make-up artists still have such a long way to go in creating convincing old-age effects?<br />Those expecting Robin Williams' usual buffoonery and in-your-face wisecracks will be disappointed, as he instead offers a gentle and understated portrayal of a misfit trying to belong. Bicentennial Man also features Sam Neill, in his usual unobtrusive role, Pepsi-kid Halle Eisenberg as \\"Little Miss\\", and a sparkling performance by Ambeth Davidtz as both the grown-up Little Miss and her own granddaughter.<br />Bicentennial Man is certainly a pleasant diversion from an audience member's own personal struggle, but will fail to generate much moral discussion. Despite his mental and physical transformation from machine to pseudo-man, Andrew can never develop a soul. Consequently, neither can the film itself, which beats with a prosthetic heart.

0385504209|5.0|There are obviously two approaches to works such as these...one is the standard approach that most readers assuredly take and that is to enjoy a gifted author penning a marvelous book (hence the reason for this to be on the best-seller list for what seems like forever). The other of course is to approach this with the historian's view...a view toward the astounding revelations that Brown exposes here about Christ and the actions of the Catholic Church. I, with little theology history background to formulate an informed opinion, lean towards the first approach and wholeheartedly recommend \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" to any and all readers who enjoy a thrilling novel or who enjoy the capability of an author to captivate the reader and truly define that old maxim \\"a page turner\\".<br /><br />This well publicized story is a good one...a murder at the Louvre is so mysterious that it requires a Harvard symbologist and a polce cryptologist to help solve. Clue after clue are uncovered revealing the existence of a secret society that has guarded a powerful secret for ages that, if exposed, would rock the very foundation of Christianity. There are of course the bad guys who would go to any extreme to keep this information secret and this conflict, with it's many plot twists and turns is Brown's stage. Many new perspectives (at least to me) are added to the base understanding of Christ and the Catholic Church that, although controversial, can surely lead one to further study. None of this would have much meaning however if it weren't for a capable author...one who has a marvelous story-telling and story-writing ability. The reader is truly captivated and will have a hard time putting this down...I'd wager that regardless of which theological side you're on, you'll race through this work to see how it ends.<br /><br />So for an astounding revelatory read with an historical bent, you'll do no better than \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". Brown's controversial classic is sure to continue the ages old arguement on Church and Faith, but, if you're able to get past the controversy, you'll enjoy a superlative literary experience.old arguement on Church and Faith, but, if you're able to get past the controversy, you'll enjoy a superlative literary experience.
B00003CWTI|5.0|This movie is amazing.  It's not your typical sappy romance or comedy.  It is black comedy at its finest as the story of people's interwoven lives during times of crisis.  I won't guarantee that you'll be at the edge of your seat at all times, but you will be taken in by the stories.  And if you are fascinated by the human condition and life in general, and if you find bad situations slightly humorous on some level, then you will love this movie.  It is also one of the finest castings of Tom Cruise that I've ever seen.
B00028HBL6|1.0|The Passion of the Christ, directed by Mel Gibson, is a graphic depiction of the last twelve hours in the life of Jesus. Although Christ (Jim Caviezel) is shown to have healing powers, the Jewish leaders see him as a trouble-maker and turn him over to the Roman authorities on contrived charges of treason against Caesar. An oft-told story, it is Gibson's vision to focus on the horrific suffering Christ endured on the day of his crucifixion. <br /> <br />Since religion has always been an impassioned issue liable to start wars, the needless controversy surrounding this picture arose before principal shooting had begun. The majority of the film's Jewish characters, caught up in mob mentality, are portrayed as self-righteous and uncaring. The Romans fare worse, with most of them behaving like bloodthirsty boors. Yet, history cannot be rewritten to placate sensitive individuals. If anyone today proclaimed themself a Messiah, would we not condemn him in exactly the same manner? <br /> <br />Sadly, the trite screenplay (co-written by Gibson) assumes we know the antagonists' motivation, and barely touches upon Jesus' teachings of love and forgiveness. It chooses instead to glorify the barbaric atrocities of our race in lengthy scenes of blood-drenched torture. <br /> <br />As the copper-eyed prophet, the usually engaging Caviezel has little to do but gasp in pain, while the two Marys drift through the draining story in tears. Pontius Pilate is depicted as a reluctant judge and Herod a fop, while the sporadic appearance of a female but deep-voiced Satan seems peculiar and out of place. <br /> <br />Gibson also co-produced the film, which was lensed in southern Italy because of its resemblance to ancient Israel. The stained teeth and coarse clothing give the film convincing period detail, but the visuals are drab and without colour. The entire movie is also spoken in the acerbic Aramaic language and accordingly subtitled. This proves to be only mildly distracting -- the rhythmic score and too-frequent sound effects of twittering birds are far more annoying. <br /> <br />Like Michael Cimino's infamous Heaven's Gate, The Passion of the Christ will prove to be Gibson's artistic folly. It lacks the beauty and marvel of past biblical epics, offering no entertainment or educational value. Further, there are far too many slow-motion sequences that merely accentuate the slow-moving narrative. If those opposed would simply ignore rather than protest, the film would come and go soon enough. But the curious will carry it for the first few weeks, until interest dies down and this pointless and uninspiring film is laid to rest in a sepulchre. One can only pray there will be no resurrection this time around. Rating: 2 out of 10. <br />

B00005A0RI|4.0|If Weber's assertion that anything truly original benefits from reduction, then Charlie Haden's ongoing distillations of film-era jazz are continuing to improve not only the songs in question, but also the genre, which has suffered by addition too much of the time.   <br /> <br />It's fair to ask: how so?  By adding whomever to Sonny Rollins and Joe Henderson, studios virtually ensured a playable, but mediocre result.  Jazz has been brought along not by big names, but by groups who insist on its place firstly as a group phenomenon and only secondly as a vehicle for individual expression.  Haden's experience proves this point.  Back when jazz was the culture, this was understood. <br /> <br />So now on to the music - what makes this highly understated album worth owning?  \\"Nightfall\\", \\"Noche de Ronda\\", \\"Contigo En La Distancia--En Nosotros\\".  Listen in particular for how Haden works with the pianist.  Jazz companionship is not always regarded as the highest and best outcome of a broad musical endeavor more associated with virtuosity of late, but it is one hell of an achievement, and these and other songs resonate with simple phrasing which references a common center.  \\"El Ciego\\" is matter of another color entirely and the violin work is what you come to expect.  I wish there was more of it on this CD. <br /> <br />I reserve the right to place 4 stars on this if only because perfection is reserved for the other-worldly, but this is a fine and, considering present circumstances, rare example of conversational jazz.  Enjoy.
6305508550|4.0|When I first noticed this movie, I thought it would be very much like Scott Adam's comic strip Dilbert; however, it turned out to be different. Instead of just taking the corporate nonsense, the main characters in Office Space fight back. <br /> <br />My favorite character was Milton (Stephen Root). He has so many quirks you just have to laugh. This movie has a somewhat interesting plot, but I really found myself waiting for Milton's strange lines.  <br /> <br />Another great character was Peter Gibbons played by Ron Livingston. I felt that everyone could relate to this guy who had cracked from the pressures of work. <br /> <br />This is a good movie to watch after a bad day at work, because it will brighten your day.

B000002UAX|2.0|I have always had the feeling as talented as the Beatles were, they wouldn't be half the success they were without their great producer Sir George Martin. He acted (while they were listening) as their quality controller as well as an amazing producer. And the result was some of the finest albums ever made. That is up until this one. 30 songs on one album is far too many. Only about one third of this album is quality. The rest is filler. Tracks like Dear Prudence, Revolution, Back In The U.S.S.R, Its Your Birthday and My Guitar Gently Weeps, are among the best tracks. But if they had taken the wise advice of Sir George and released this album as a single album with the best 9 or 10 tracks. It would've been better for them in terms of critical acclaim. And this album would be up there with \\"Revolver\\" (their finest album) and \\"Rubber Soul\\" and \\"Sgt Pepper\\". Sometimes less really is more.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Waking the Fallen is, plainly said, a great cd. After listening to a few of their songs on their website over and over I finally picked this up, and I have to say it's one of the best things Ive heard in a long time. M. Shadows has a great voice, and can sing a variety of styles, not JUST screaming; which is hard to do. Intrumental work is just as good. The songs are melodic, easy to listen to, and contain countless influences- I've never heard anything like it. Every song is excellent.  <br />This cd is good for fans of \\"hardcore\\" and also those that enjoy other kinds of rock.
B000002UAR|5.0|There is nothing negative I can say about this album. It is simply the Beatles masterpiece, they never got close to this again, neither Sgt Pepper or Abbey Road are in the same ball-park. And the reason is simple. They were working together as a true creative group with fresh exciting ideas. Strong songwriting and above all. QUALITY CONTROL! I can honestly say, this is about the only album I have ever listened to from start to finish and enjoyed every song. And songs like \\"Tommorow Never Knows\\" ,\\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\" ,\\"Eleanor Rigby\\" & \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" are pure magic. This really is the greatest pop album ever made. I think all lovers of great music should own a copy.

0393035158|3.0|Author Sam Harris is a philosopher and a religious critic who feels that belief in a higher being and the whole notion of organized religion is detrimental to the good of society. He feels we would be better off with no religion and he makes his case for the \\"End of Faith\\" in this book. Harris feels that religion is the root cause of much of the world's evil and that most of the fighting that takes place in the world would be gone if religion took an exit from society.<br /><br />Harris isn't too fond of any religion but he is most critical of Islam. To Harris, Islam poses a grave and immediate threat and he points to the attacks on September 11, 2001 and to the actual scripture of the Koran as proof of his opinion. Terrorism is a serious issue, and according to the book, Islam is not compatible with a free and rationally- functioning world. The book also attacks religious moderates, whom the author feels are nothing more than fundamentalists in the making, since most every religion has radical beliefs at its core.<br /><br />I can understand where the book is coming from in some instances. I can agree that fundamentalists of all faiths are a menace to society and I like the fact that the author chose to include actual quotations taken directly from the holy books of the world to prove his point. But I think his negativity toward religion in general is just as extreme as the devotedly religious people he so deplores. The book makes no effort at all to see the positive side of religion. It doesn't take into account the charitable acts, the positive ethics, and the sense of community that some religions bring to society. They are all dismissed as obstacles to human development at best, and perpetrators of terrorism at worst.<br /><br />Eliminating religion would not wipe out the force of evil. The book doesn't go quite this far in its discussion, but it comes very close. As much as these terrorists of recent years have strong allegiances to religion, there is no mention in the book of the fact that leaders like Stalin and Mao Tse- Tung were responsible for millions of deaths and were not religious in any way. I think the book gets a little carried away in this regard when it tries to pretend that evil will mostly disappear if religious faith was a thing of the past. Concentrated political power is just as large a threat- if not more so- than religious extremism.<br /><br />This book is written in a very intellectual way and it contains plenty of references to back its claims. I don't necessarily believe in everything this book preaches about religion and its supposed detrimental effects on society. But I do respect the author's point of view, and even though I disagree with some of his conclusions, I feel this is a good book to read by those who have an interest in philosophy and religion and who like to tackle controversial subjects.on in the book of the fact that leaders like Stalin and Mao Tse- Tung were responsible for millions of deaths and were not religious in any way.

B000005RNQ|5.0|Well, I was 5 in '79 but, later, when I first heard this 1981 release by Saxon, I understood why they hit it big and are still going strong (yet underrated).  Saxon was part of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal that was unleashed on the world in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Formed in 1977, Saxon--as is announced in the track \\"Denim and Leather\\"--burst on the scene in 1979 while on tour with Motorhead.  Denim and Leather was their 4th album in just three years of putting out studio releases.  It starts with \\"Princess of the Night,\\" an interesting and charming track about an old, obsolete steam locomotive that brought fond memories to one young admirer: \\"She used to be an iron horse, 20 years ago.\\"  It sounds like early Iron Maiden (another of the Brit Metal New Wavers).  Although this track and others on here resemble the style of Paul Di'Anno era-Maiden, vocalist Biff Byford sounds so much like Bruce Dickinson on this first track, it's scary!  \\"Princess...\\" is my favorite song on this album followed by \\"Out of Control\\" with its catchy guitar hooks.    The rest of the album has a blue collar hard rock sound.  Fans of early AC/DC and early '80s Judas Priest will like Saxon's rawness and aggression.  The title track is an anthem to rock 'n roll that would fit nicely on any AC/DC album of that time.  \\"Play It Loud\\" is another AC/DC-esque anthem.  Saxon may have sounded blue collar, but they also paid attention to details.  \\"Rough and Ready\\" has some nice vocal harmonizing.  \\"Midnight Rider\\" is another favorite of mine.  It reminds me of the catchy tracks off Judas Priest's Stained Class. There is nothing weak here; every track kicks!  Recommended to fans of early 1980s metal during a time when metal was about to be accepted as cool by the record-buying public and well before pop metal bands began to swarm on the music world.

These kudos are due not only to his wonderfully varied piano and guitar work but, unfortunately, because his playing so much better than Bono's writing on this album.  The rhyming of every line is so juvenile and makes for predictable listening.  Subpar songwriting can't be overcome by great playing.

Waiting for a train, I bought Digital Fortress - BIG mistake. The book is ridiculously predictable, from the \\"rugged handsome\\" looks of the hero (yes, even that tired old clich got included), to the usual professional assassin who never fails, but still manages to do so half a dozen times when up against a language teacher, to the heroine who knows the answer to it all, wants to tell her boss, but is told \\"Not now, Susan \\", whereupon this strong, brilliant cryptographer shuts up !!!!! <br />And I LOVE the ending. I never knew it was possible to look at a screen showing hackers trying to break into a system, and KNOW that, yes, they's managed to get some information, but only partially. Wow - that's some screen !!!! <br />Aaaaaarrrrgghhhh. DON'T waste your money on the book - donate it to the Red Cross or something similar instaed
0596007124|5.0|I was pretty surprised to see the Head First team covering design patterns, since the topic easily lend to dry, academic, books. I am even more surprised by the end results,  <br />It's the best entry-level title on patterns I ever read. The authors brilliantly managed to keep the reader engaged and cover the pattern inside their contest (unlike other books where they are in a vacuum). Be only advised that a basic understanding of Java is required to get the best out of this book <br />
B000000OUJ|5.0|First, we were inroduced to the 36 Chambers of the Wu-Tang Clan in 1993. Shortly after, we entered Method Man and ODB's (R.I.P.) respective chambers. In 1995, another classic was unleashed courtesy of the dynamic duo of Raekwon The Chef & Ghostface Killah. Only a couple of months after, we entered the brain of The Genius AKA GZA. There is a reason why this man is labeled as the head of The Clan. His introspective verbal assults on the mic shows how deep this man's mind goes. He shines regardless, with the clan (\\"Duel of The Iron Mic\\" w/ ODB, Rebel INS, & Masta Killa; \\"4th Chamber\\" w/ Ghostface Killah, Killah Priest, & The RZA; \\"Investigative Reports\\" w/ Raekwon, Ghostface, & U-God) or with out them (\\"Liquis Swordz\\", \\"Labels\\", \\"I Gotcha Back\\"). When paired up with another MC as a duo the result is pure fire (check \\"Cold World\\" w/ Rebel INS and \\"Shadowbixin\\" w/ Method Man). In fact, there is no song on this album in need of skippin. Even the album's bonus, \\"B.I.B.L.E.\\" (Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth),an itroduction of Killah Priest as a solo MC is stellar. This album is a good listen from begining to end. PEACE !
B0002J4X1Q|3.0|But I doubt it was a plot that someone like me was supposed was to understand in the first place! :) If I'd understood the plot a little better, I'd definitely be giving this four stars - the way it stands at the moment, it's borderline four stars. I think the plot was just a little too complicated for me!<br /><br />I've never played the game, although I've watched it being played, so I recognised a few of the places, and got other places pointed out which were in relation to places in the game. I wasn't sure what it was about beforehand, but I loved the zombies! Of course people are going to draw comparisons with the original and remake of Dawn of the Dead, and Shaun of the Dead, as they feature heavily on the walking dead, but in this, there's new, inventive and very gory ways of killing people and the walking dead. Once again, the word zombie is never used in this movie, much like the other 'zombie' based movies. Night of the Living Dead director George A. Romero was originally attached to write and direct, but left the project in 1999 due to creative differences over the script. The project was dormant for over a year before Paul W.S. Anderson signed on to write and direct the movie. This film was originally titled \\"Resident Evil: Ground Zero,\\" but the title was changed to just \\"Resident Evil\\" after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the USA.<br /><br />And for the guys - Milla Jovovich gets naked! Which I got told about before the movie started. Do you see me caring?! It's also weird, because her character, Alice, never has her name spoken, written or identified until the end credits.<br /><br />The scene with the lasers is definitely a scene you need to watch out for. It's so weird to watch, as you think they're OK, and then the bodies split apart in all kinds of ways! Ugh!<br /><br />For some reason, I thought Mira Sorvino was in this, and had no idea who Michelle Rodriguez is, apart from the fact she scowls a lot. One of her lines is very funny, where she says she's going to get laid once this is over.<br /><br />A newspaper in Racoon City reads 'The Dead Walk!' This is a direct reference to Day of the Dead, in which a newspaper at the beginning of the film reads the same.<br /><br />I don't really know much about the director Paul W.S. Anderson, apart from this wasn't his first movie based on a video game - the first was Mortal Kombat. I know some people don't particularly like him, or his work, but I really liked his movie. I don't really pay much attention to how the movie is directed.<br /><br />There's quite a few connections to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. These are: main character's name is Alice (an easy one to start with); computer is named 'Red Queen'; 'The Red Queen' needs to kill someone who is infected, so she tries to get someone else to chop off their head. (Off with her head!); Alice in Wonderland paperweight; a white rabbit was used to test the T-virus; to enter the hive they go through a mirrored door (through the looking glass); and the Red Queen also succeeds in cutting off \\"her\\" head - the medic in the laser hallway.<br /><br />With a soundtrack done by Marilyn Manson, you kinda know what you're gonna get with the soundtrack for this, and it's surprisingly good!<br /><br />The extras include: alternate ending with director Paul Anderson's video introduction; clip compilation: Resident Evil: Apocalypse; commentary by cast & filmmakers; visual effects commentary; costumes featurette; featurette: Playing Dead: Resident Evil From Game to Screen; scoring Resident Evil; set design featurette; storyboarding Resident Evil featurette; and 6 exclusive featurettes: The Creature, The Elevator, The Laker, The Trainm Zombie Dogs and Zombies.<br /><br />This is a surprisingly good movie, and if you're unsure, I would definitely give it a chance. It's worthwhile. And if you're a guy, you'll probably be drooling over Milla.nny, where she says she's going to get laid once this is over. <br /> <br />A newspaper in Racoon City reads 'The Dead Walk!'

B0000024JA|4.0|In 1994, Method Man was the equivalent to 50 Cent of 2002. What I mean is the anticipation for this man to release an album was sky high. This n*gga was all over Wu-Tang Clan's \\"Enter The 36\\" and the people wanted more Meth. Tical, which was released in November of 94 was well recieved by fans but at times people felt the album was a bit rushed. This was due to several reasons: While recording the album, The RZA had a flood in his studio, resulting in the beats sounding low. RZA had no time to fix this problem due to the fact that Meth had to meet Def Jam's deadline and RZA (prior to working on Tical), spent most of his time working on GraveDiggaz' \\"6 Feet Deep\\" right after \\"Enter The Wu-Tang\\". The saving grace of Tical was it's singles: \\"Bring The Pain\\", \\"Release Yo Delf\\" and the remix to \\"All I Need\\" featuring Mary J. Blige, which came out later in 1995 and won a Grammy for song of the year. The rest of Tical is fire, dont get me wrong, but the singles saved the album. Tical was the first of Wu-Tang's solo saga.
B00005JNEI|1.0|This movie is nothing but liberal propaganda.  If you want to watch a bunch of half-truths, lies, and distortions, be my guest.  A documentary is supposed to be based on facts.  Michael Moore goes around the world spreading Anti-American sentiment and gets paid millions.  What a creep!
B0006A9FMI|1.0|I was a big fan of the first Ghost in the Shell movie, and was looking forward to seeing this one. <br /> <br />The movie has one good point going for it, its animation.  The animation was fantastic.  Unfortunately, quality animation cannot carry a movie as it once did. <br /> <br />The plot was just OK.  Nothing too special, not completely atrocious, but not great.  The writing between plot development tried to be like the first movie with some \\"deep\\" philosophical commentary, but it fell flat and was just boring.  I spent a majority of the movie waiting for something to happen, and did enjoy the animation quite a bit, but could have watched a \\"highlights\\" reel of the animation and been happier having not wasted as much time. <br /> <br />I watched the DVD version of this movie, and have to comment on one thing that was distracting.  They seemed to have confused providing \\"english\\" subtitles with \\"close captioning for the hearing impaired\\" as in brackets we'd be treated to [grunt] [crowd noise] [helicopter] [static] and so on and so forth.  This lack of effort to provide 2 subtitle tracks exemplifies the second rate nature of this movie trying to profit from the success of the first movie. <br /> <br />I rate this 1 out of 5
B00005JNBQ|3.0|This movie definitely had some funny moments, but at the end of the movie I was left thinking, \\"So What?\\".  The majority of the movie is just so random and strange.  Those were 2 hours of my life I'll never get back.  However, I do admit that the scene towards the end of the movie where Napoleon does that dance on stage is hilarious.  He reminds me way too much of Poindexter from \\"Revenge of the Nerds\\".
B0001CCXGG|3.0|I bought the DVD version of this G3 concert and was a bit sceptical about how Malmsteen would fit into the mix. Having seen the truly amazing previous G3 tours with Eric Johnson and John Petrucci, I thought YM was a bit of a wildcard that could have gone either way. I have been huge fans of Satch's and Steve's solo careers for about 12 years and have seen them live many times. It's so clear that they have huge mutual respect for each other's work and guitar prowess. They clearly enjoy each other's company on-stage and communicate it through their mastery of the music in the jam sessions.<br />Enter Malmsteen ..... everything goes wrong. I will be first to admit that he is an incredible technical shredding guitarist, and if that's your thing, then good for you. I happen to dislike it, if it's done purely for the sake of it and I've never been a big fan of his playing (SIDENOTE : John Petrucci - you're heading down the same road and you're losing me. Live at Budokan - total mastery of shred, totally lacking in feeling. Last Dream Theater CD/DVD I ever buy). I've got some of YM's albums from Alcatrazz and Rising Force and there is some fantastic playing on there, but there's also a lot of ego-masturbating BS which earned him his reputation (rightly so, in my opinion). All the cliches about his lack of feeling come right back to bite him on this DVD. He totally destroys &quot;Voodoo Chile&quot; with his neo-classical posturing and it's pretty obvious from the body language between him and Satch/Steve, that they're not impressed with his self-inflated, egotistical crap either. On the DVD, there's a laughable sequence backstage after the jam, where YM tries to play the role &quot;we're all best buddies, let's go get drunk together&quot; type thing, where it's seems so obvious from the body language again that neither of the other two want a part of it.<br />Satch / Steve - put it down to experience, move on and NEVER invite YM back onto another G3 tour. I love you guys, but I cringe like when my daughter f*cks up in hockey in front of all her friends when I watch this DVD over again. I'm so embarassed for her and want to make it all better for her - I feel the same for you guys. Ditch the loser - his ego's not worth the fallout.
014028009X|5.0|I love this book. I have read it several times, bought the movie and watched it over 2 dozen times, and listened to the unabridged audio book several times. It is the perfect pick me up. You can't laugh any harder! I highly recommend the audio by Rosenblatt, she also reads the edge of reason, equally hysterical... She gives it the edge it needs, and a soul you can see. If you want to laugh your a** off and multitask- audio book is the way to go.
B00013EY7Q|1.0|This is definitely a film for soap opera queens, not serious film lovers.  It lacks the filmic depth and intrigue of great romance films and is ultimately forgetful.   <br />This movie is about the mundane adventures of two rich white people in Japan.  Bill Murray doesn't really show the classic characteristics of male romance protagonists, which would have the auspices of making him appealing, but the fact is he is not that interesting as a character at all.  His two main characteristics seem to be that he is rich and he is bored.  This begins to wear on the viewer until they realize who had exactly made the film, another person who was also rich and bored.   <br />Murray has appeared in other dramas that have tried to test his dramatic ability, anybody remember Razor's Edge?... didn't think so, which have landed mediocre reception.  Murray is best when he is cut loose and zany.  In this movie he just kinda bloats around, looking out of place, restrained, until he meets another person from his home country, and they parade around town poking fun at the natives.  Murray, being a comedic genius, could have used these scenes as very funny moments, riffing as he usually does with pomposity, but instead the scenes drivel out, as does most of the film.  The ending offers no real meaning or fulfillment and I found myself trying to keep my eyelids open.  The emotional space explored in the film is mostly confusion and sulking, which I guess make it a perfect woman's film. <br /> <br />If you thought this movie lacked substance, a good substitute might be Hemingway's \\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" another story about confused white people in a foreign country, but this one is a classic and a great read.  <br /> <br />
B000002OK3|5.0|I did feel a bit gypped when I paid the regular price for this half-hour CD, but for anyone who saw the movie and even moderately enjoyed it, it's a must-buy. With the dialogue included, it can even function as a kind of poor man's DVD. <br /> <br />One star for Little Green Bag. I never realized how good this song was until I heard it in full. <br /> <br />One star for Blue Swede's Hooked on a Feeling, which, although it only plays for a second in the movie, is a great song. <br /> <br />One star for the way Steve Wright pronounces 'Bohemiath.' It's worth buying it just for this. I'm serious. <br /> <br />One star for the Madonna Speech, and Lawrence Tierney muttering: \\"Chu...Toby Chu?\\" <br /> <br />One star for the way Steve Wright says: \\"...and Edison Lighthouse's...Love Grows...Where My Rosemary Goes.\\" <br /> <br />The Coconut song and Stuck in the Middle With You are also great. The only thing I missed was any part of the dialogue which begins with Steve Buscemi saying: \\"How come _I_ gotta be Mister Pink?\\"
0767834739|3.0|The sequel to Resident Evil, Apocalypse pales in its shadow.  Resident Evil was a guilty pleasure that provided decent entertainment.  Milla Jovovich did a decent job of playing a action-heroine.  I only wish the sequel managed to achieve its predecessor's quality. <br /> <br />Milla Jovovich did manage to learn one thing about acting: she surrounded herself in the sequel with actors of such a caliber that in comparison is an Oscar caliber performance.  Yes, everyone else in the movie is that bad (although they do have wonderfully stereotypical accents).   <br /> <br />The plot is also so disjointed to lose all logic.  First a virus is unleashed around the city so the evil corporation puts a wall around the city to keep the zombies in.  Makes sense so far, but for some reason they put mercenaries in the midst of the city for no discernable reason other then to provide ready victims.  And from there the plot continues to flounder.  What ultimately ruins plot is that is composed of specific action sequences taken from the games with a narrative designed to bridge the gap.  A big mistake. <br /> <br />The ending of Apocalypse (following the final battle) is the best part of the movie.  It promises a sequel that escapes the shackles of the game series.

B00005JN0T|4.0|For those who are looking for fidelity with Issac Asimov's works, you will be disappointed.  If you are looking for something that captures the some of his spirit, you will find a enjoyable movie. <br /> <br />Will Smith plays his typical role as a wise-cracking detective who is always just a little bit smarter then his co-stars.  Due to a accident in his past, he has an intense distrust of robots which have become common.  This distrust serves him well as he is assigned a closed room case where the only suspect is a robot which couldn't commit a murder due to the first law of robotics.  To continue would be to give away too much of the plot but just about every character is deeper then they appear while remaining true to themselves. <br /> <br />The plot has some holes but is genuinely enjoyable.  The acting is decent in a summer blockbuster sort of way.  The finale is gripping and does Asimov justice.

B00063F8B2|5.0|The Polar Express is an excellent soundtrack and will become a Christmas classic. From traditional songs like Sinatra's \\"Santa Claus is Coming To Town\\" to Josh Groban's \\"Believe\\" this soundtrack is a joyus holiday wonder. It will be part of my Christmas music collection for many Christmas seasons to come.
B00005R62K|4.0|The production on 'Stained Class' is it's biggest downfall.  I know it was the late 70's and all, so it's about what you'd expect, but that doesn't make it any heavier.  The guitar tone is a bit weak, and the drums just sound kinda flat most of the time.  Too bad they don't have a guitar sound like Sab had on 'Symptom of the Universe' or 'Sabotage' in general.  However, the production has it's benefits, and the whole album has a surprisingly sinister feel to it, particularly considering the era.  Simply put this is good stuff, and extremely metal for the time, and a definite extension of the Black Sabbath sound into more modern territory.<br /><br />The whole band is extremely tight.  Tipton and Downing provided the basic template for metal lead guitar, and were thus so influential that they don't seem as striking and original as they likely were at the time.  Still, they're great soloists, particularly on 'Beyond the Realms of Death', which has some of the best lead work ever on a metal song, no question about it.  The rhythm section is very solid, though nowhere near as flashy would eventually become typical for a metal band.  Still, they more than get the job done, and the bass is very prominent, with some particularly nice work on 'Saints in Hell'.  Halford's vocals are just great.  He's one of the few singers who can shriek all the time w/o getting on my nerves, and he has got a very nice straight singing voice as well.<br /><br />'Exciter' is a great opener, a definite standout, and a very nice piece of proto-speed metal.  Solid riffing, unrelenting drumming a catchy chorus and lots of great leadwork.  The infamous 'Better By You, Better Than Me' is a cover, and thus one of the more 'rock-ish' tracks on the  album, but it's a real standout anyway.  It's got a very solid groove, and some of Halford's best, most memorable vox, and is surprisingly atmospheric.  'Saints in Hell' is probably the most sinister sounding song on the album, with a fine, rolling rhythm section and a startlingly thrashy middle break, which is years ahead of it's time.  'Beyond the Realms of Death' is perhaps the prototypical 'true metal ballad' and is definitely the  best song on the album.  The basic framework is more than solid, with Halford's best vox on the album, and some fine, sorrowful acoustic guitars.  The chorus is sufficiently explosive, and the middle solo is simply astounding.  It's as moving and sorrowful as any solo you'll likely here, and the second solo later in the song is quite good too.  All the other tracks are at least pretty good, if not remarkable.  The title track is probably the best of the remaining tracks.  They've all got fairly catchy choruses, at the very least, even if the whole structure and tone of these other tracks isn't as satisfying as on some of the particular standouts.<br /><br />A very good, very important metal album.

0316779237|4.0|The first story about the Santaland stood out more than the others, but I would give the story about the baby in the dryer just as much credit for being just as creative and almost as funny. This is a book that you will find yourself laughing outloud, which I have never done before until now. The best part is that it is small enough to fit in a purse and the stories are short enough to read while trying to waste time. I gave it four stars because there were a couple stories that drug on and could have been deleted and the author is very forgiving when you read another one of his right after
B00006879E|2.0|I've yet to understand Maroon 5's appeal. While the CD has some catchy tracks, the vocals lack a strong delivery and the songwriting is weak. I'm quite sure that Maroon 5 will never have another breakthrough CD- they lack staying power.
0345446798|5.0|As a professional dog trainer with over 18 years experience, I have read and continue to read dog training and behavioral books on a regular basis.  I was really pleased with this book.  It isn't just a \\"dog training book\\", it is thought provoking and has a lot to offer.  For one thing, the author is an actual animal behaviorist which is kind of a treat.  Many authors of dog training books are dog trainers, not animal behaviorists and attempt to pass their \\"opinions\\" off as fact which can be irritating.  If authors are going to write \\"facts\\", they have to be actual facts and not just opinions that they feel strongly about.  This author does that, she frequently backs her thoughts up with scientific proof which is really refreshing.  I like that she talks about her own dogs alot and their behaviors.  I just thought it was a great book and recommend to readers.  This book will remain on the top of my must read list, I have already recommended it to a few of my dog friends.
B000286S8S|4.0|Ok I am going to get this out in the open, I am a huge VH fan! I love both the Roth and Hager years.  Each frontman brings a differnt look to VH.   <br /> <br />Overall this is a very good CD.  It has lots of great songs from the Roth years(Jump, Panama, Eruption, Runnin with the Devil...) and great songs from the Hager years(Top of the World, Right Now, Why Cant this be Love, Runaround...).  This playlist is probley the  best they can do but if I were VH then I would of made sure then I would of put in Cabo Wabo, Mean Streets, and Don't Tell Me What Love Can Do.  I find the three Roth era songs sung by Hager live were a waste.  I don't nee to hear Sammy sing Jump live(if i want that then i can get the live DVD). <br /> <br />Also the song Finish What You Started gets cut off at the end so we cant hear the last couple of seconds. Yes it really doesnt matter because it is only a couple seconds at most but it is the point of the matter.  VH got sloppy and took a short cut and to tell you the trueth it makes me a little uneasy.  Also there is no trace of Gary Cherone on this album.  Sure he was no Roth/Hager but he deserves at least one track. He isent even mentioned in the bio or discography.  That makes me a little mad to tell you the trueth.  That is sleezy.  The three new songs sung by Hager are sub par.  Not bad (better then Roths 2 tracks he sung a couple years ago on Vouleme 1).  I could do without them but it is comforting to know that the boys are back in the studio makin music! <br /> <br />This is a great collection for any VH fan.  If you are new to VH then i highly recomemed this album.  It is a overall a very solid album, not perfect but solid.  I wish a could of given this a 5 but it is not a 5 album.  If I could then i would give it a 4.25 but I can't. <br /> <br />Great album little rough around the edges with a pretty good playlist but I just cant give them a 5.  VH ROCKS!
B000001FQQ|1.0|Certainly you can sense that changes were a foot, but with a half baked production, Gene's material sinking even lower (if possible)and Paul straining his vocal chords over less than convincing copies of more popular acts ideas there is too little to redeem this one. Of course there is always one shining light in the depths of darkness this time a mega ballad called \\"Forever\\" which managed a good placing on the mainstream charts and allowed the band to hit the road (promotors were un-convinced that a tour could be supported until the single charted). \\"Hide Your Heart\\" has Bon Jovi written all over it spoilt by an over obvious  chorus, \\"Read My Body\\" a sub-standard Def Leppard wannabe, and na na na's, ah ah ah's and woah woaha's punctuating any other song that lacked a lyric to finish it off properly. In my mind the darkest hour musically for the mighty Kiss. Add last to your collection. Even the cover sucks the big one.
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? I waited nine months for this movie to come out, and was there on opening night. I saw it many times in the theater. Sure, some things have been changed, but if you're looking for an entertaining movie that's based loosely on the book, this is for you. Eric Bana is the best in this movie, in my 'unbiased' opinion. (Yeah, right; he's my favorite actor!) The others are good, too. Brian Cox is excellent, Peter O'Toole... Sean Bean is good as always, and Brendan Gleeson makes a convincing turn as Helens' ego-wounded husband. The fight scenes are intense and memorable, and it's always cool to see fighting for honor-not glory-as is portrayed perfectly by the awesome Mr. Bana. As I said... SEE IT!!!
B0006A9FKA|4.0|SHAUN OF THE DEAD is one of those rare comedy horror movies that works and that's because it's script takes chances and goes where many movies have been afraid to go in their satirical whimsies.  The movie has some marvelously hilarious scenes (i.e., Shaun and his buddy using old lp's as killer discs, fighting over which ones they should keep).  It also has some intensely dramatic and poignant scenes (when Shaun tries to prevent his friend from killing his soon to be zombie mother or when his stepdad admits to Shaun that he really loved him).  Credit a remarkably versatile cast, starting with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as Shaun and his buddy, Ed; ending with wonderful support from Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton as Shaun's parents.  The gore is plentiful and some of it quite horrific, but the movie's genial tone manages to resurface by the end and in the extras, there are some humorous explanations for the plot holes.  A well done, different film.
0440418569|1.0|I was horrified after reading this novel. After all the insanity about Harry Potter I can't believe those books have been slandered and I never heard anything about the evil in this last novel of this series.<br /><br />I'm not conservative or fundamentalist, in fact, I probably hate organized religion as much as Philip Pullman does, but this was really over the line.  My major complaint is that it is a childrens book.  I'm an adult and I was deeply disturbed by the horrors in this book.  I can't imagine having read this book if I were 10 or 11, as a parent I'm deeply disgusted.  I've never wanted to burn a book before in my life, but this one I had a strong urge to.  If I hadn't gotten the book from a library I probably would have.<br /><br />My second big complaint is that this book is not entertaining in the slightest!  Will and Lyra's characters and development fade into the depressing background of the morbid story. The afterlife as a horrific prison camp even babies are sent to? God disintegrating in the wind? Not to forget 'deaths' which are spirits that hang around you your whole life just so if you kick off they can lead you to the aforementioned hell. Nice. I like excitement in the plot, but after this mindnumber I wanted to down a bottle of Prozac and go into a coma for a week or two.<br /><br />I won't even comment on the fact that the author had two prepubescent children have sex in order to SAVE THE WORLD. Gag me and give me a break. Oh well, I guess I commented on it afterall.
B0006B2A2E|1.0|Please, when will studios STOP releasing Collector's Edition DVD's right after the release of the original version?  I'm sick of it already.  It's one thing for a remastered edition to come out 3+ years after the original release of an older movie, but this is coming a mere 3-4 months after the original release!  Pathetic...
B000002JPA|5.0|Images and Words is where it all began, the beginning of one of the finest and most inspiring bands of my lifetime(15 years).  Despite their actual first album in 1989, this is the one where it all came together, the one that set them off.  Every song in my opinion is a gem, truly original in each its own way.  Songs such as \\"Pull Me Under\\" and \\"Metropolis\\" were instant classics in the bands history and also in my musical experiences.  I believe everyone with good taste should get this album.
068987474X|2.0|First off, I agree with the message of this book - don't traipse around pulling your hair out over someone who's not treating you well.  A guy either likes you or he doesn't.  However, it shouldn't cost you $18 to read this message in hardcover - you could have gotten it in three pages.    This book is thin and even if it's just meant to be funny, could have used a little more than made-up examples and witticisms.  It could have used a few relevant statistics, maybe some insight from other guys (or even more insight with Greg himself!) or a psychologist here and there - but instead it's just a series of MADE UP EXAMPLES that Greg and Liz respond to, based on combinations of their friends' past frets.      At first, I didn't realize that.  So I got scared. One of the examples in the book is about a woman who's in a six-month relationship with a man, they visit the Grand Canyon together, and when they get back, he \\"disappears.\\"  Doesn't write, doesn't call.  I read this and I thought, \\"My God, if you can't trust someone and open yourself up to them and risk being hurt after a six-month committed relationship, then when can you?\\"    Then I found out that this was a myth - the examples given are all \\"aggregates.\\"  Not that stuff like that doesn't happen.  But the idea of someone disappearing from a relationship like that is frightening.  So further in the book, Greg says that he, himself, did the same thing to a girl once.  A year later, he saw her with someone else...she was more dignified than his behavior was, he tells us.  Fine, but he never explains WHY he did it, and what was going through his head at the time.  So we're left very confused about this behavior.  How does someone like you enough to get to know you for six months and then disappear?    And the next question is - how do you prevent yourself from getting hurt in that way, or letting that happen to you?  This book does not answer that.  The Rules (oft-maligned as they are) actually do...they tell you not to jump in too fast, not to give guys too much too soon or you might end up hurt.  Obviously, there's stuff in \\"The Rules\\" that's a joke (like not calling a guy back...that's just stupid).  But the overall message of The Rules is to take care of yourself.  \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" gives you the courage to move on after you've had your heart ripped out, but it also lets the guys off the hook, and it doesn't give us those \\"whys\\" we're searching for when it happens.    This book is so thin that they have no business putting it out in hardcover and earning millions of dollars by scaring women.  If they were/are going to do that, beef it up a little with some insight.      Another example:  Greg puts in his funny statistics: \\"100 percent of men polled said they were jerks for disappearing on a woman.\\"  Thanks for the statistical analysis.  It actually would be good to hear from some men (besides Greg) on their reasoning and thoughts, since they remain as confusing to us girls as ever (and vice versa, I'm sure) at the end of the book.      Greg frequently notes how good he is to his wife, how he treats her like he's \\"into\\" her.  But it doesn't tell what was so dang special about her that she got a commitment out of Greg the Playa.  Maybe Greg can't be honest; maybe she was just incredibly sexy and good in bed and anyone who isn't perfect has no hope.  Maybe she played by \\"The Rules\\" and ignored him for a while and he found that hot.  Greg refers to his past as a player, but doesn't tell us what made him change his ways.  If you're going to charge a high price for a hardcover book, give us a little more insight.      Don't just make up a bunch of letters and then answer them yourself.    I think the book belongs in the humor category more than self-help, and Greg and Liz are clearly both very talented, especially if they wrote for Sex and the City.  I did give this book more than one star, because I do agree with the empowering message.  I also think they are both damn good writers.  And if the book makes women feel better about moving on, that can't be bad.    Unfortunately, I think there is so much more they could have put into it.  Now I hear Greg and his wife are working on another book.  I hope they do more with it than just make a quick buck.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I don't have a lot to add to what Joseph wrote below.  He sums it up nicely.  This movie is almost never funny, and it doesn't have anything else going for it. <br />I honestly don't get what other people like about it.  I've had movies recommended to me before that I didn't think were all that good, but at least I understood why they liked them.  This one...a complete dud. <br />The only thing I can figure is that lots of college students are watching this in groups while drinking heavily.  Then maybe it would be funny.  Maybe.
B0006SSOHM|5.0|This movie is awesome, but very graphic. I think the title 'Saw' does not really fit the movie. A saw does play a very large part, but the title does not really show the great quality of the movie. If the rating system could go any higher, it would be higher. 6/5 and I think I found a new favorite movie.
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|Maybe, but probably not. Inspired is a word that could not possibly be used with this complete \\"mess\\" of a movie. If there were to be an award for \\"Worst Screenplay Ever Written\\" then David Benioff should win that award - absolutely no competition need apply. The other interesting note is how the director of Das Boot has sunk this low - but not surprising since his last outing was almost as bad (The Perfect Storm). Now he has given us \\"The Perfect Mess\\" - what a waste of time, talent, energy, and money. Even Brad cannot save this movie (even though he does give it a courageous try). Ironic at best (and not even a guilty pleasure). A total loss! <br />
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Cheesy Casio soundtrack + zero charisma characters + zero plot + nothing genuinely funny... Not enjoyable in the least.  This movie is nowhere near the billiance of Raising Arizona or Rushmore as other reviewers might lead you to believe.  It is poorly written, with very limited dialog.  I can only assume that the only reason this movie has gained any attention is due to MTV putting their logo on it.  If \\"MTV Approved\\" means quality to you, then by all means gobble up this turd.   <br />This movie should have been a \\"learning experience\\" for its creators, letting them move on to better projects before really getting any exposure.
068987474X|5.0|I refer to Greg and his gems of wisdom whenever I chat with girl friends about relationships these days.  I can't help it: Greg is quite insightful in his book.  Yes, he can be a bit harsh in his truth-telling.  But I sure am glad that he is firm in his advice about us not \\"wast(ing) the pretty\\".   <br /> <br />The biggest insight for me from the book is that, yes, some of our dates have major issues or obstacles that they must overcome to be totally commited and that doesn't mean they aren't into us.  HOWEVER, regardless whether the guys are \\"just not that into you\\" or whether they need some help right now, the result is the same.  For whatever reason, these men are not willing or cannot pursue us full heartedly and with consistency.  Our response should be the same as well: get out and don't waste the pretty! <br /> <br />Thanks, Greg, I get it now! <br /> <br />
B00065GX64|5.0|I'm sorry for those who already own the former 1999 Criterion DVD of M (including myself, of course....) but this one is a must-buy item. <br /> <br />After more than 7 decades since its making, Fritz Lang's M remains a poignantly modern film; a striking portrait of the contemporary human world as we live in. <br /> <br />Fritz Lang, who always regarded M as his best film and the one by which he would be remembered, used to call it \\"a documentary\\". It is one of the first films about serial killers, and already Lang goes beyond depicting the pathology of such criminal; what M examines is the pathology of our contemporary society of urbanization, mass politics, and mass media: it's also a film about a 20th century metropolis of mass society and mass media culture. <br /> <br />The former Criterion DVD edition of M was made of the best available material back then-- a print restored from many different sources, re-establishing as close as possible, Lang's original release cut. It was also a good transfer for a standard, NTSC digital medium. <br /> <br />But what sometime happen in the world of film restoration is, some materials that have been considered to be lost are suddenly be re-discovered. This new edition of M is created (for the most parts, expect for one reel which was missing) from the original camera negative, and transferred to HD video master. The result is-more details, less scratches, finer grains, and more subtleties. <br /> <br />The earlier DVD was a bare one. This new edition presents Lang's portrayal of social pathology of the 30's also with an audio commentary by Anton Kaes and Eric Renteschler. Kaes's book about M published as part of BFI classics series had already revealed Lang's freighting vision, pointing out how much of M was based on real events and real details of Berlin, including some underground figures played by actual underground celebrities of Berlin. With audio commentary, his points can be more articulately appreciated. <br /> <br />The supplements on the second disc can be seen as a testimonies of how many filmmakers and critics regarded M as a their contemporary film, how much inspiration M has been provoking in film history. But they have seen the film in far less complete versions than we can do now; for M has constantly victim of censorships, banning, alternations and mutilations over the years. The DVD also includes that history, including the Nazis who banned the film using segments of it in a propaganda film accusing \\"decadent art\\". <br /> <br />Watching M again on this new DVD was again a real inspiration. Though it is an early sound film, with very limited resources compared to the modern sophisticated technologies...well, it testifies how much one can do with the medium of cinema.

1592400876|3.0|Parts of `Eats, Shoots & Leaves' are informative, playful and downright funny.  Unfortunately, Lynne Truss sometimes takes her self-appointed role as a `stickler' to unpleasant extremes.  It's one thing to be a purist, and quite another thing to be a literary fascist.  Perhaps her humor goes farther over the top than I'm comfortable with, but some of her more pointed rants seem more cruel than playful.<br /><br />I found her diatribe on the 9/11 attacks to be more than a bit unsettling.  Many newscasters used the word `enormity' to describe the scope of the tragedy; according to Ms. Truss, they should have used the word `magnitude.'  While thousands of families mourned the loss of their loved ones, Ms. Truss was apparently more troubled by poor word choice than by human suffering on a national scale.  For the record, I happen to believe that `enormity' was the correct word.  `Magnitude' quantifies only size, rank, or extent.  `Enormity,' although often misused as a synonym for `magnitude,' refers to monstrous offense, evil, or outrage.  To my mind, all of those words are appropriate in the context of the 9/11 attacks.  They convey the nature of terrorism much more surely than a word that pertains only to matters of scale.<br /><br />Lynne Truss manages to teach, scold, joke, and cajole - all within the pages of the same book.  I can't help but be impressed.  That she has pushed a grammar book to the Bestseller list is even more impressive.  As a writer and lover of words, I wanted to cherish this book, but its playful spirit disappears too often behind condescension and intolerance.  As a consequence, I love parts of the book.  I don't care for other parts at all.<br /><br />Jeff Edwards, author of \\"Torpedo: A Surface Warfare Thriller\\"
B000000OQF|3.0|This album is worth it if you can bear axl's crappy voice to listen to Slash's and Izzy Stradlin's guitars.  Axl has without a doubt the worst voice on earth next to Ozzy Osbourne, Mick Jagger, Roger Daltrey, and even though I like Brian Johnson and Bon Scott, their voices do suck but AC/DC wouldn't be AC/DC without them.  Welcome to the jungle is well, like my college Engish teacher, TOLERABLE, Paradise city is the second best song on the album, Sweet Child O' Mine is no. 1 for this album, but not GNR's best song, that would be November Rain (a truly spectacular power ballad).  Other than the songs I mentioned above (the only gnr songs they play on the radio), the album is not that great, even though Nightrain, and the great rocking love song Think About You, are good, they wouldn't appeal to a casual fan.  Now like the title says this was not the album to have in the late eighties, hell, it didn't even start getting good airplay until almost 1990.  The year was 1987, the Metal Gods Def Leppard still hadn't released their latest album that took them to hell and back to make, metal had become more pop with the likes of Bon Jovi's 12 million selling (that number is to date, not in 1987) Slippery When Wet had become the current stewards of the metal throne while the kings were away, Van Halen was riding the strength of their best album ever 5150 which was the first with Sammy Hagar, and it sold millions, poison had Look what the cat dragged in and it was doing well preceding the mega success to come, then came the unbathed, unshaven, drunk and arrogant axl rose with Guns and Roses, and they had some success with Welcome to the jungle, and then came the second coming of the Leps, with Hysteria, the album to have in the late eighties, it began the chart charge with the excellent rocker Women, which crawled into the top twenty for some reason it had little success, then came Animal which is another superb song but it peaked at no. 19, then came Hysteria (the song) whichshot its way into the top 10 at no.6, and now they were six months into release, 3 million record sold and was at this point only half the record Pyromania was, and then cam the crunch time, Pour some Sugar on me was released to huge success, and ran up the charts all the way to no.2 and the first day it was released Hysteria sold almost 500,000 copies, that is almost going gold in one day!, and 4 million copies on the run of the single, and Hysteria the album hit no.1 on the charts, ahead of OU812 by Van Halen, Appetite for Destruction by of course GNR, and Open up and say ahh by Poison.  The next few months to come would bring up three more top ten hits, with Armageddon It rocking to no. 3 and Love Bites, the greatest Power Ballad ever Love Bites blasting to no.1. and finally in 1989 Rocket, Rocketed into the top ten at no.5 and Hysteria racked up nearly 13 million sales around the world, and over 18 million to date making it the no.2 best selling Metal/rock album ever second only to Back In Black at 19 million.  So if there was any doubt that the so called glam metal was dwindling in the late eighties you're crazy, because the second half of the eighties metal was twice as big as the first, and Def Leppard, not GNR not Van Halen, not Bon Jovi or Poison, championed it, and I hope this clears things up for everyone.
B0000027RL|5.0|Music is one area where we can be influenced so much by a band that we become biased beyond reason. I guess this leads people to say things like \\"Pearl Jam is the best band in the world\\" and \\"Nirvana were just posers, they had no talent\\" and stuff like that. The moment I hear comments like that a red flag goes up in my mind...just because we love a band we are in no position to say any other band is mediocre because obviously the love for a certain band makes us blind to the talent of others.      Here, I don't intend to compare Pearl Jam to Nirvana or Sound Garden or any other Seattle based grunge bands, which made it big during their time. Whatever their comparative talent was, the fact remains that all of them made it big in the mainstream and the fans around the world accepted them with open arms.    Having said that, let me get to the crux of this review.  \\"Ten\\" is one of the most successful debut rock albums of all time. Eddie's vocals are so primed for a grunge act that it's hard to believe that this is their debut album. When I first bought this album, I was not a grunge fan to begin with. I really didn't care about the messages the lyrics tried to convey. But \\"Ten\\" converted even a skeptic bystander like me to sit up and take notice. Personally, this is my Pearl Jam favorite. Their subsequent albums were good too but if you are someone who is here thinking whether I should buy this album or should choose one of their subsequent ones....the answer is an unequivocal YES!!! You got to buy it. Because even if you choose to buy \\"Vs\\" , \\"Yield\\" or \\"Vitalogy\\" you will anyway come back to buy \\"Ten\\"..so why not start here!!! But don't blame me if you find yourself howling along with Eddie and ending up clobbered by your neighbors:-))    Izzy
B00069L0XG|1.0|i've never gotten dizzy in a movie before but this movie almost gave me a headache. the camera angles were so bad that even paul anderson himself admitted that there were some 'issues'. half the time, i couldn't even tell who was hitting who. so people can't say that resident evil apocalypse was directed well. i'm sorry, but if anderson himself said that, and he wrote the thing, then c'mon...at least give me that. so yea, setting aside the fact that i'm a huge fan of the games, i can honestly say that people weren't liking the film when i saw it in the theatre. i could hear people complaining in the theatre 'while' i was watching it...and trust me, they were just regular movie-goers, not fans. and what was the deal with the part where jill was trying to light the gas? could alice just kinda read her mind or something? i mean, where did she come from? did you ever even NOTICE that? *blinks* explain that if you wish...but you're just reaching if you can. not to mention, how many times was alice going to explain that she worked for the umbrella corporation? alright, we got it already, we saw the first movie...and even if we didn't, you STILL explained Alice's history more than once in this movie! it felt like it was made for tv or something... and i admit, the previews made it look promising, but that's maybe because i thought that alice had a real purpose for running down the side of a building...perhaps because it was blowing up? but no...she just wanted to kick someone in the head. *eye roll* look, jill was way too gun-ho for my taste. and i don't even see why she had to be...i never thought that any of the characters were ever in any 'real' danger...it wasn't good for horror...it wasn't good for action...it just wasn't good. the creator of the series, shinji mikami, was quoted as saying that the movies were just \\"interesting\\". he didn't say much else... hmm...could it be that it didn't really matter what he thought because the rights had already been sold? look, without shinji...the games wouldn't exist...and we wouldn't have resident evil...'period'. anderson, along with many others, really butchered mikami's hard work. they changed it...and that's really insulting to him, i'm sure. at least make a decent movie if you have a 40-50 million dollar budget. i really hope that they don't make a third...they just seem to waste money and milk that 'resident evil' name for all it's worth. there's no way these movies would have gotten as much money as they did, without that name... and as a movie itself, setting aside the fact that it's based on something, it really just isn't fun. i just think some people are afraid to admit that it's bad...just because it's called 'resident evil'. and btw, i know that by movie standards, they didn't have much of a budget, but i'd really appreciate it if people would just start asking themselves...\\"could i have done a better job if i had 40 million dollars?\\"
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Our entire family loves this movie! Even my husband and I, who are both past our mid 30's love it! Not since Dumb and Dumber and Office Space have we had so much fun memorizing all the funny lines in the movie and using in our everyday lives! We have had a lot of fun with this movie and it is definitely an instant cult classic. The characters, Napoleon, Pedro, Kip, Deb, Uncle Rico and others are people I think we can all relate to in some way or another from some part of our lives. Total thumbs up for this instant classic! Definitely the best movie of the year 2004 and perhaps beyond.......
B0006213WG|5.0|Let me just start by saying I loved this album. It's diffrent from their first album and shows they're growing as musicians, and NO, they did not rip-off Metallica or Coldplay or Linkin Park or any other band. Anyone who has actually listened to their albums knows that. Plus, anyone who has listened to this album will have to give all the Simple Plan comparisons a rest, this album is completely diffrent from all those petty \\"pop-punk\\" bands that are so huge right now. So, if you like real music, and you like good music then spend a few bucks and buy this album. <br /> <br />
B000002BPS|4.0|this is a pretty damn good cd, i wish i never gave it away.  i was a huge offspring fan during my 8th, 9th ,and high school years.  but now im really not into them anymore.  a little while ago i started downloading the offspring and i was like \\"why did i give away ixnay on the hombre\\"?  that was a bad move because i really like a lot of the songs on this cd, and especially Smash.  (I gave Smash away to).  My favorite songs on this cd are Mota, Cool To Hate, I Choose, and Gone Away.  If you like this I also recommend Smash and Conspiracy of One.  Skip Americana its to pop/punkish for me.  Anyway the Offspring are a good band and they sound even better live, so just buy this damn cd already!
B00005MCX2|1.0|I loved this when it came out, but I also loved lots of things then that weren't good for me. Not that this is harmful in any way... it's just that it is really, really awful. <br /> <br />Lemmy is the only one in the band that could play with any facility or sense of melody, and even he wasn't exactly at his best then. The drummer is an unsteady, two-lick metronome, and Dave Brock continuously uses a wah pedal on his guitar solos to try to cover up for the fact that he sounds like he's playing with his toes. Overlay it all with undifferentiated sonic sludge, add a flute/reed player who seems to have never learned half the notes on either instrument, and sprinkle with \\"cosmic\\" lyrics that weren't so much goofy as stupid - that was Hawkwind.  <br /> <br />Don't buy the hype. Hawkwind was always terrible, if terribly sincere. They were a joke then, and if you pay what they're asking for this idiocy, the joke's on you. Want space rock? Buy Gong, or even Planet Gong, not this mud.
B000000WCA|5.0|Ok, Wheter you like it or not..The Spice Girls are THE best band..and STILL are. This album rocked from begining to end. Wannabe is a song you can listen to 100 times and still would want to hear it agin. Trust me. I can't pick a favorite, They ALL are amazing. Everyone one should own this cd. It's a must to have. I still play it a lot..I had 2 buy another one cuz my first was so damaged. As soon as i Saw wannabe for the first time..I was captured and took a 1 way ticket to Spice World..lol Nothing can even compare or come close to these goddesses. Nice one girls..can't wait for a reunion(there will be one!!!)
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I was so blown away by this set.  It is incredible!  Any serious rock music fan MUST add this to their collection.  I hate to admit it, but when this first broadcast on TV I was very young and didn't have much interest in it.  I only caught pieces of it back then.  But now we can sit back and pretty much enjoy most of the show!  Highlights:  Adam Ant (in his prime!), Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys (looking much younger and fit), Queen (they stole the show, as they often did!), Elvis Costello standing on stage entirely by himself, just playing a guitar and singing with the audience singing along with him...breathtaking!, Ultravox doing an awesome rendition of &quot;Vienna&quot;, Howard Jones doing a great version of &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; and so many others, too many to name here.  This brought back so many good memories of that time.  I even enjoyed watching the bands that I am not a big fan of, if only to see those wild 80s fashions!  :)  I was also a bit disappointed that &quot;Tears Are Not Enough&quot; was not included.  I thought the sound quality was fine....sure it wasn't perfect but what do you expect from a live show recorded on tape 20 years ago that was never intended to be viewed again?  The white lines across the screen during some of the performances were a bit distracting (I guess its due to microphany) but you get used to it after a while.<BR>Overall an outstanding set that I will enjoy for years to come!  Well worth the money!!!!

B0002X314C|5.0|I've been waiting for an artist to make up for the absence of a Maxwell or D'Angelo, the perfect blend of neo-soul/sensual soul as Carl Thomas and Anthony Hamilton and John Legend has filled that void.  This is a great debut CD and it seems he will have a very bright future under the production of Kanye West.   <br /> <br />The CD has very good balance as tracks like \\"Alright,\\" \\"Number One\\" \\"Number One\\" and the lead single, \\"Used to Love Her\\" give you plenty of R&B with an Old school feel, definitive Kanye West production.   <br /> <br />My favorite track the piano slow-jam \\"Ordinary People\\" that allows Legend to carry the entire song with just his soulful voice and piano. Also worth noting are \\"Lets Get Lifted Again\\" which is another bedroom joint and \\"So High\\" another slowjam for that special someone in your life. <br /> <br />He has a similar past to Anthony Hamilton in that he has worked with plenty of well known and established artists before getting the personal recognition.  And just like Hamilton, his debut CD shows that he is more than ready for the spotlight.  Definitely worth the money here.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|When I first put this cd in my cd player I expected to hear awesome guitar solos because of all the people that say Hendrix is the #1 best guitarist of all time. I think Jimmy Page is the best but Hendrix ain't far behind. Hendrix guitar playing is great to listen too any time. His guitar solos are something everyone should experience. They are played really well and are the best on this cd. Even the drumming is great. Mitch Mitchell really playes the drums loud and fast. The best songs on the album are \\"Purple Haze\\" which is one of my favorite songs. \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" is another great one and almost as good as \\"Purple Haze\\". One of the best guitar solo songs on this album is \\"Star Spangled Banner\\". All it is is a guitar solo. All 20 tracks are great and will keep you playing this cd for a long time.    SONG RATINGS:  1. Purple Haze-(2:51)-10/10  2. Fire-(2:43)-10/10  3. The Wind Cries Mary-(3:20)-10/10  4. Hey joe-(3:29)-10/10  5. All Along the Watchtower-(3:58)-10/10  6.

B00003CXAT|5.0|This is probably the most credible, most perfect concept in science fiction that I can recall.  All those saying that it can't possibly happen in real life have no imagination.  I have no doubt that the restoration of life from extinct genetic material will one day be possible, and that is what makes this movie so exciting.  The plot is secondary to the main ideas in the movie, and is not important.  Bravo to a great movie, with great effects.
B000006TRV|5.0|(...)    (now onto the album)  I gotta say, this is one of the best albums I have heard in my life. Pink Floyd has moved from a band I didn't know to one of my top 5 favorite groups just from listening to this album. I have viewed the movie right after I listened to this and the album makes much more sense from watching that. I recommend picking that up right with this. What I love about this album is that every song is linked kind of like combined into one big song that go's on for 80 minutes. And if they can make a great movie with all The Wall songs on it and have so much success with the movie it has to be great, right. I usually like cd's with awesome guitar solos and drum solos and all that but this one had hardly any and I think I enjoyed it even more without solos. The vocals are the main thing that brings the 26 songs together.     Roger Waters is great singing and really can show us what he's feeling in each song. The vocals are sad, depressing, sometimes funny, and also interesting. How are they interesting. Because I have never heard what I did on this cd. It's so well put together. The lyrics actually make up a plot and that made the cd great. David Gilmour actually does have some guitar solos but not as many as in the other cd's. The best song he is featured on with guitar solo is \\"Comfortably Numb\\" which is one of my favorite Pink Floyd songs. I found the drumming to be great in this cd. It was deep, and I really loved it in \\"Hey You\\".     SONG RATINGS:   DISC 1   1. In the Flesh?-(3:19)-10/10   2. The Thin Ice-(2:29)-10/10   3. Another Brick in the Wall Pt.1-(3:09)-10/10   4.

0783225849|5.0|I saw this movie over 40 years ago, when it first came out, and I remember the screams in the theater.  Although the filming techniques and the dialogue and some of the acting shows its age, the film is no less exciting to watch than when I orignially saw it.  The logic in the development of Norman into what he became is perfectly credible, whether or not there are people who have actually gone \\"psycho\\" off the movie screen.  Every time I see the movie I see at least one more thing that I didn't notice before, and I am still shocked at the \\"mother's\\" appearance and actions.  It still scares.
B0002858YS|1.0|Here is the formula of this band: <br />1) Make a catchy beat. <br />2) Put it lyrics without sense (somebody told me that you had a boyfriend who looked like a girlfriend). <br />3) Make a disc with one \\"hit\\" song and the rest just songs that don't give anything new to music(I'm not saying that the hit does). <br />4) People will feel like \\"cool guys\\" when they buy your music and think it is the best.  <br />5) YOU ARE KNOW A ROCK STAR !!! <br /> <br />HEY WAIT! <br />THIS FORMULA SOUNS ME LIKE ........mmmmmmmm........ o yes! FRANZ FERDINAND (if you like franz ferdinand album buy this and keep listening to crapy music)  <br /> <br />I know that most people will hate this review but that is because they will know that this is just the truth of this kind of bands and I know that this band will be easily forgotten into some months unless they have another hit and the story starts again.
0140187537|5.0|Published in 1961, a mere year before Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize for Literature, *The Winter of Our Discontent* is the culmination and thematic summation of a Great American Author, the resultant craft of a man who, over the course of his career, concerned himself with the American Ideal and the American Reality, despaired at stagnancy and loss of character, and ever fought the rising forces of material obsession and moral capitulation; it is a masterwork, albeit a slow-going and rather depressing one at that.  Steinbeck would never again produce a novel of this scope and social-penetration, nor need he try: along with *Grapes*, *Eden*, and a few other contestable entries, the man had made his mark upon the literary zeitgeist: with *Winter*, he had fulfilled his promise ten-fold, delivering a powerful fable of loss, despair and (potential) redemption.<br /><br />Ethan Hawley is a deeply troubled man.  A Harvard graduate and veteran, he has settled for the path of (dis)contented mediocrity.  Forced to work as a clerk in the store his father owned - and lost, due to shady speculations during World War II - Ethan continually ruminates inwardly on the past, the present, and the rather-dim looking future; he is haunted by the daunting specters of his wild, whale-hunting ancestors, an imposing legacy he feels inadequate to challenge; he endures beneath the crushing weight of perceived - and socially imposed - *failure*.  The ghosts of the ancestral dynasty are ever on his mind, while the concerns of his immediate family threaten his strongly-inlaid yet increasingly fragile moral bedrock - for his wife and children resent the poverty of the Hawley misfortune, the wife constantly giving subtle hints as to her personal shame, unable to \\"hold her head up high;\\" and the children, pining for the creature-comforts the productive 50's began to bestow (a television, new car, etc.), which the lack of solvency denies them, begin to slide into pubescent angst and experiment with the relative-morality ethic seemingly prevalent everywhere beyond the Hawley domain.<br /><br />In a sense (as several of the negative reviews on this page have pointed out), one feels Steinbeck has crafted a too-perfect foil in Ethan: he is almost *too* good, *too* straight-laced, and thus a rather `easy' contrast to the various corrupting forces the author perceived in the United States - and wished to combat, via the artistic craft.  And yet, and yet... there is more than enough psychological meat in the text to justify the technique. Ethan's character is complex, and complexly drawn - the reader is given the clues, well early on, that the seed of temptation actively writhes to undermine the protagonist's staunch moral code; the presentation of such is done in a way both obvious and yet subtle, for we know what will happen but wonder (and hope) that events might force these carefully-laid plans awry.  Nearly the entire novel can be thus seen as a slow, achingly certain capitulation of the primeval American standard - that is, honesty and self-reliance, coupled with integrity - and the key, then, is in making the main character likable and sympathetic in his torment.  And Steinbeck succeeds marvelously, not only in Ethan but in those around him, who alternatively tempt, encourage, repress: Mary Hawley, the loving yet anxious wife; his son Allen, already succumbing to the irresistible forces of corruption; bank-manager Baker, epitome of fat-cat syndrome; Danny, the childhood friend-turned-alcoholic wastrel; and Margie, the most vivacious and vividly-drawn, the fallen-woman & town comfort, grown desperate as the years march on... Steinbeck has the way, as with all masters of word-smithy, to fashion a character within the space of a few lines, and make them seem *real*: someone you've seen before, or perhaps known intimately.<br /><br />Again, I stress that *Winter* is not an easy read: the phrasing is deliberate and dirge-like, alternatively evocative and experimental (~while avoiding the excess of stream-of-consciousness); the atmosphere of New Bayton - and Ethan's inward ponderings - is gloomily suppressive, a miasma of failure, discontent, addiction and existential angst.  Even as the time-table of the novel enters into spring, then summer, the cold shadow of *Winter's* desolate, desperate themes linger on.  No, not an easy read - but, in passages, a beautiful one, and well worth the effort undergone.  It is Steinbeck's final masterwork, a thousand-year gaze penetrating the cozy illusions of the fifties and accurately predicting the turmoil of the upcoming Aquarius decade.<br /><br />Five Stars.iding the excess of stream-of-consciousness); the atmosphere of New Bayton - and Ethan's inward ponderings - is gloomily suppressive, a miasma of failure, discontent, addiction and existential angst.

B0002OERI0|3.0|The album's great, but if you principally play music on your PC you're in for a rude suprise. In order to prevent piracy, I presume, the publisher has choosen to prevent legitimate buyers from being able to listen to their own CD on a CD-ROM drive. Cute. Here's a novel idea, punish the music pirates, not your legitimate customers!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I happened across this movie in, of all places, a bargain bin several years ago. This is one of my all time favorite movies. Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root give knock out proformances, the supporting cast is just as high caliber, the sets are accurate and visually stimulating and the film, IMO, is on par with A&E's Pride and Prejudice.<br /><br />I recently began switching my VHS over to DVD. While this DVD has no special features, it was great getting a more accurate cover than the old VHS had (an embarrasing \\"clutch\\" shot of two models who aren't ever in the movie!). If you love the Regency period or an \\"Austenite\\"-you cannot pass this film up:)
B00028HBKM|3.0|Here's what's good about \\"The Passion\\". It's a beautifully filmed movie. It's a dark and disturbing look at the last 24 hours in Jesus' life. Its dialogue is all in original tongue (Aramaic and Latin) giving the film a wonderful ancient perspective never before experienced. It's a movie that has an amazing amount of power.    Here's what's not so good, it appeals solely to Christians. There is no doubt in Mel Gibson's mind that Jesus is the Son of God. From the appearance of Satan though out the film to the earthquake after Jesus dies, Gibson reminds us that it is not a man we see but God in the flesh of man. As a result of this, it is not surprising that many Jews are offended by this movie. They are portrayed in not the kindness light. Which brings us to our next point, is it a movie about history or faith.     In the end, this is a movie about faith.  Sadly, it would be a better movie if others, than just Christians, could access that faith. I don't think this movie tries to divide people or faiths, but any movie solely about a particular kind of faith is going to alienate others. I also know of many children who have seen this movie and I cannot recommend it for them. This is a graphic and violent film that promotes adult discussion about faith. It is not for kids. Finally, since this was such a controversial film, I am surprised by the absence of DVD extras, not even commentary. I think in this movies case, the extras could have been added respectfully in providing a little more clarity to a film that has had such an impact.  (3 and a half  stars)
B00009P1O2|5.0|I admit I became a true Queen fan late in life. I've known their music for years, of course, but never saw any performances to fit to the music. Then, I got my copy of Live Aid on DVD. To say that Queen ruled that show from on high would a MAJOR understatement. That performance was incredible, amazing, and completely once-in-a-lifetime. I was hooked. When I found this DVD on Amazon, I promptly ordered it. I wasn't disappointed. The group hits the stage running, and all engines firing. The sound is wonderful, and I really enjoy hearing the crowd roar along in sing-along mode or in approval, it makes the whole concert DVD experience like stepping back in time to actually be there. Some have taken exception to Queen doing old rock standards like 'Tutti Frutti' and 'Hello Mary Lou', but I feel they did those to just have fun with the show and the audience, so just enjoy it. The whole presentation is top-notch, the picture quality is outstanding for 19-year-old video tape recordings, and the sound will blow you away! Honestly, VERY few artists have innate showman and performance talents. So many try, but that's really all they do. Freddie Mercury had a God-given gift to own a stage by sheer presence alone, not to mention what the man could do with his voice. We really likely won't see his like again in this pre-packaged age we live in now, which is a true shame. Get this DVD and enjoy the amazing talent on display, and keep it in mind when you see a concert on TV, and just appreciate what true talent is.
B0001ADAVK|5.0|The line up was promising; Julia Roberts, Kirstin Dunst, Maggie Gylenhaal and Julia Stiles. This film delivered. It's feministic approach was refreshing to see, and delivered in the form of Julia Roberts character, who incidentally was not a man-hating feminist, showed that the movement was not a way of women attempting to rise up against the oppressive and hateful men that ruled their lives, but a motion towards some kind of respect and equality. Roberts' character dated, loved, and worked hard for all she wanted. She motivated the girls to make a life for themselves that existed beyond the boundries of masculine expectation, so they would not regret letting the oppertunities pass them by.  <br />Kirstin Dunst impressed me immensley in this film. I remember her saying in an interview a while ago, she'd like her acting to be taken more seriously and that she's sick of being the love interest or the girl next door... well, to me, all you need to do is look at her in Mona Lisa Smile and you can clearly see that this girl is headed for something major. She was spectacular, and the part suited her to a T. I wouldn't really have picked her out before watching this film, but if I see her in a serious role again, it will compell me to watch it.  <br />Similarly, Maggie stood out as more than Jake's sister. She was, perhaps, the second most outstanding actress in the movie, besides Kirstin. <br />This film opened my eyes. In a way, it also showed me that you can't change people who've held beliefs in their minds for their entire lives to a, perhaps, more positive opinion, unless you're prepared to really fight. Or maybe the film shows that people should give advice, but allow others to make their own unaided decissions? Either way, it's a film worth watching, and I loved every minute.  <br />

B000002INJ|5.0|Hark!!  The bone-crushing mammoth juggernaut of Manowar rolls through the weak-willed lands of the world, destroying everthing in its path, and turning little mice-men into tiny bags of mush.  Beware!!  When the massive riffs and searing guitar solos are off in the distance yet, you have no choice but to immediately dig a hole like the puny wimp you are.  There is little hope for escaping the vulgar wrath of Manowar.  Once Manowar have passed through your vicinity, there will be little left but burnt foliage and pulverized wimps.  Your only option is to boldly take up the sword and embrace the pure power of Manowar.  Do this in short order, for Manowar has little patience.
B000000993|5.0|Not that this album is in dire need of additional scrutinization or anything, but I've now decided to add my two `sense' here into this huge Amazonian mix.  So here we go..........<br /><br />The major thing I need to say about Tool is that you CANNOT take their music at face value, not for a single danged second because once you fall for the brilliant facade, you've basically fallen into the chasm you think you're avoiding by listening to Tool in the first place (more on this later).  There are multiple layers of meaning, multiple layers to those meanings, and even layers to how these meanings interact with other meanings.  If you look at Tool from only one perspective, then you will completely miss the point of what Tool (or at least Maynard) is trying to show us.<br /><br />Alright, so why do you listen to Tool?  With this album and the \\"Opiate\\" EP that preceded it, it had a whole lot to do with a defiant theme of `questioning authority'.  I mean sure, the music on \\"Undertow\\" is utterly sweet in every musical aspect, laying the foundation for modern nu-metal.  But it was the messages of anger and depression and the manipulation of religion that so seemed to torment Maynard that really got attention.  This is what got the freethinkers and atheists into Tool, because they, like Tool, `questioned authority'.<br /><br />Questioning authority is good.  Really, it isn't the greatest idea to just submit to anyone and everyone that seems to hold authoritive influence or power of some sort.  However, it's one thing to truly search for truth and truly find it, and something else entirely  to ignore the truth simply because you don't like it.  This album is the story of someone who searches for truth, but somehow prefers desperation.  This album is a HUGE slap in the face to those who hear Tool and `question authority', and yet fail miserably in that very regard by not even thinking to question the authority that TELLS them to in the first place!  This album, \\"Undertow\\", is the beginning of the longest and most complex rock opera ever recorded (more, even, than \\"American Idiot\\":-).  If you're still reading, pay attention.<br /><br />Questioning authority truly IS the friggin point, people.  Once you question Tool's true motives behind their music, then you will begin to understand what Tool's is actually saying.  \\"Undertow\\" is the story of someone who questions authority and arrives to the WRONG conclusion, which is that there IS no conclusion.  Humanity just blows.  He just wants to sleep through this (`why can't we not be sober?').  Depression depression depression.  It is patently clear to this character that religion cannot be the answer to anything he's looking for.  He questioned that authority, and decided that it doesn't make sense to follow God.  But throughout the album there are snippets of this guy looking back, and thinking \\"maybe I left the answer back there\\" with religion.  \\"Digustipated\\", the album's closer, seems to be this guy reminding himself that he doesn't believe in God, that religion is a tool used for greed and manipulation.  He's trying to run away from his doubts.<br /><br />If I had the patience, I would go track by track and explain the obvious meanings of the track, the not-so-obvious meanings, and how each falls into the story perfectly.  Unfortunately this can't be done right now, but try looking at it like this: \\"Undertow\\" runs seamlessly into the following album \\"Aenima\\", which follows the same thematic thread but has the character realize that he has to look beyond himself, beyond his eyes for the answers.  At the closing, `Third Eye' is a determination to look for spiritual guidance, and \\"Lateralus\\" is the eye wide open and the truth understood.  Ever notice all those eyes in the \\"Lateralus\\" artwork?  Anyway, that was an incredibly inadequate summary, but I'll need to continue with those on their own reviews.<br /><br />In people's great respect for Tool and their belief in `questioning authority',people are losing Tool's greater meaning by not questioning what Tool is trying to say.  If you look at it from multiple viewpoints, it makes more sense than any other musical work I have ever heard.  I know a lot of folks will disagree simply because they can't believe Tool could get any more complex then they already thought, but this is what it is.  I'll write my other Tool reviews A.S.A.P. and tie it all together, but until then, yours truly can't wait `til Tool album 2005!!!!!authority', people are losing Tool's greater meaning by not questioning what Tool is trying to say.

B000654YK6|5.0|After watching HYPE for the first time last year, I was left in awe at the beautifully created masterpiece that I had witnessed.  It came as a shock to me that this film was largely unheard of, and very upsetting when I tried to get my hands on a copy for myself but could not find one.  Therefore I am very pleased that Lionsgate decided to take on HYPE and release it in DVD format.  This movie opened my eyes to the wonders of the Seattle &quot;scene&quot; and the grunge music that I had previously ignored.  The film even inspired me to travle to Seattle and explore it myself!  You do not need to be a fan of NIRVANA or Soundgarden to enjoy this film as it deals with many other grunge acts besides the popular ones, and it is more of an exploration into the societal aspects of this large cultural movement than a direct focus on certain bands.  Enough said, I highly reccommend this movie to anyone interested in musical history.  HYPE is a crowning achievement in my books!
0312263120|2.0|I read \\"Da Vinci Code\\" loaned from a friend and was totally mesmerized by the new facts and startling secrets revelead therein. It lead me to buy Angels & Demons which I couldn't keep down till I read the last page (Yes in one sitting !!). I read Deception Point and which sounded to me quite predictable by that time. I hunted for the 4th novel and finally got my hands on Digital Fortress.  <br /> Digital Fortress is based on very good facts, however that's the end. It lacks the usual Dan Brown style. It turns out that the unbreakable cypto code developed by the ex NSA employee is nothing but a computer virus. And it turns out the super intelligent female crypto expert is infact not very intelligent after all. <br /> <br />Disappoints me. I would still rate \\"Angels & Demons\\" as best book so far by Dan Brown. <br /> <br />Harish Garg

B0006399FS|5.0|How many U2 albums have we seen fall flat on their feet in the last 12 days? The answer, of course, is one. Luckily, this album has broken this trend - falling flat on its feet. Many core fans, such as Bono and THE_GREAT_WHITE_SANDWICH, have been disapointed with this album and are exchanging it for GOLD_COINS_APLEANTY - the latest smash hit from 'How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb'. However, this album doesn't stick to that trend, but veers off into a new and boring direction, sticking close to its routes. I certainly won't be buying this album again in the future. Good luck trying to find a copy, it's worth every penny! 3/5 Stars, Album of the year! <br /> <br />Signed, <br /> <br />Bono
B00005OAIE|5.0|This Mayer album was musically pleasing.  I especially liked the song \\"My Stupid Mouth\\".  But I recently checked this Dustin Joel guy out in the Music Downloads section.

0385508417|3.0|Grisham is a mesmerising storyteller. He can take a trip to mall and narrate it with gripping details. And that's what Skipping Christmas was - Grisham trying to narrate a rather banal and ambivalent series of events surrounding Christmas planning. As aptly pointed out by many reviewers here, the story leaves you with a mixed bag of feelings - should everyone give up and partake in the spending frenzy so aptly propagated by the businesses, as so lucidly illustrated in Grisham's tale, or should you do better things with that time and money, at least once in your lifetime, like the Kranks attempted. The story has many irritating and irrational gaps, which exist just to prop up the series of events (like not being able to explain the change of plans to daughter; or nosey, yet It's-a-Wonderful-Life-like neighbors). Definitely not worth being on the NYTimes list, if not for the Grisham name! I'm a big fan of his writing, and I'm hoping to have a good read in the upcoming \\"The Broker\\".

B00003CXCT|5.0|Sure there are some things changed here and there, but for the better. The scene with Darth and the Emperor-so much better and no more monkey faced weirdo image. Using the voice of Jango for Boba Fett in ESB, genius.  <br /> <br />People, stop nitpicking the films. You all know these are the best three movies we will ever see. Slight tweaking doesn't change that. Sit back, and enjoy the best trilogy ever (sorry lord of the boring rings fans). Plus, we get amazing extras from this dvd set. The only complainers here and the same ones that think that any of the new trilogy will ever match this one. Grow up. Movies that were great when you were a child will NEVER match what you see as an adult.
B0002V7ODI|2.0|There were some interesting scenes in this comic book adaptation by Mike Mignola, but ultimately, the hackneyed plot and confusing storyline outweighed the nifty artistic flourishes. The movie begins in WWII-era Russia, where the nazis open a gate to hell for just long enough to allow a baby demon to escape. An American scientist adopts him and raises him as a force for good. We then cut to present day, where a full grown Hellboy is teamed with other mutants to go get the bad boys at the behest of the government. But when the old nazis return from the dead to take their revenge, Hellboy has his most challenging adventure yet.<br /><br />  Some of the fight scenes are really cool, as are some of the character concepts (one of the villains is a clockwork assassin, for example). And Perlman's acting combined with his cool makeup job carry most of his scenes. There are also some funny moments that Perlman brings off exceptionally well, as when he jealously shadows Selma Blair when she has some intimate moments with a mutual acquaintance. Ultimately, thought, the action scenes get more dominant and less interesting, leading to a climax that is all about tying up loose ends.
B000063V8T|4.0|Well you have to like it that next gen finally broke down and used Spock, but my only problem is they kind of made him out to be this peaceful idiot. A little more wisdom from Spock would have been nice and more scenes with him and Data would have been nice but for the most part a good episode arc.  <br /> <br />My highlights for the season go against what I usually like from Trek. My favorite show was actually Inner Light where Picard lives an alternate life that really takes place over a 30 minute period where he is knocked unconscious. It finally gave me a little insight into Picard and made him human where none of the other seasons had done that for me.  <br /> <br />The season as a whole was decent. Highlights were adding a protagonist like Ensign Ro aboard the Enterprise. Most of the time I liked this addition to the crew, but periodically it was ridiculous, like her advice to \\"Captain\\" Troi on the episode Disaster. I also greatly enjoyed Conundrum where characters don't realize who they are and Warf thinks he is the captain.  <br /> <br />Lowlights for me have to be one of the most overhyped terrible episodes in Trek lore and thats Darmok. What a load of babble this show was. I actually fell asleep watching it because of how amazingly boring it was.  <br /> <br />The season ender was decent but I was having trouble figuring out if they were going for humor, drama, or what with the plot. The use of Mark Twain, though ridiculous was fine with me. I thought the throw away comment by Twain when he reaches the Enterprise-have you ever seen Halleys Comet was humorous though. (to those who don't know, Twain was born the day the comet appeared and died the day it reappeared 75 years later)
B0002XNT0I|3.0|This is one of those topic movies that needs to be made to articulate an issue, but my God is it depressing. I don't even like to remember the sad scenes that make up the movie; Tom Hanks struggling to fit in while his coworkers first shun and then fire him is enough to bum anyone out. The powerful performances enhance this gloominess, and there is no heartstring left unplayed by the filmmakers. I feel guilty about giving this such a mediocre rating, but I just wouldn't recommend it to anyone who didn't need to be taught a lesson about discrimination against HIV positive people.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Movies based on myths have always been hard to translate to the big screen but Troy does it surprisingly well, with a few reservations.  Casting Achilles was a tough job, but Brad Pitt pulls off the role  with the immaturity and arrogance we come to expect from a hero whose only reason being at Troy is to win glory for himself. The real surprise is Eric Bana who does an excellent job as Hector whose unwavering loyality to his homeland proves to be his downfall. Bana gives Hector the depth and emotion and proves he can really act (The Incredible Hulk not withstanding).  The fight scenes were excellent (I wouldn't want to be on the business end of Ajax's hammer).  The fight between Achilles and Hector is a classic, no kung-fu here, just a good old-fashioned shield and spear throwdown between the two baddest warriors on the block.  That scene really ratched up the suspense.  We all know that Achilles will win, but Hector gets in a few licks of his own and you want to see every minute of it before Achilles lowers the boom.  True, the producers had to condense the story to fit the timeline, but to have Achilles in the Trojan Horse went a bit far; they could have stuck more to the Iliad and not butcher that part of the story for the sake of time.   All in all, a good if somewhat flawed movie, definitely worth seeing more than once...on DVD.
B00001MXXH|4.0|This is another comedy whose appeal is both undeniable and difficult to explain. Matthew Broderick, who sounds slightly congested throughout the movie regardless of whether he is faking illness, is a Chicago teenage maverick who decides to take a day off of school and goes to elaborate lengths to both fake illness and enjoy himself. I know that when I saw this movie in theaters as a teen, I loved the image of slickness that Broderick portrays, and his limitless popularity. The angry sister and principal are good foils to his shenanigans, and there is a definite value to the recurring (bomp-shicka-shicka) theme of the soundtrack. The most compelling subplot is that of high strung friend Cameron, who is convinced to borrow his father's highly prized car without permission. This leads to tension that in turn leads to some comic highlights, but the teary resolution in which Cameron begins kicking the car while dialoguing with his absent father is probably the low point of the movie.
B0002DB52M|4.0|I was curious as to how I would react to this film. I was on the side of the fence that absolutely loathed von Trier's Dancer in the Dark but I was rivetted by Breaking the Waves. And so, how would I react to his latest work? Well despite its near 3-hour length, Dogville had me glued to my seat throughout. This morality play with its Brechtian approach to staging and props works magnificently. Far from being distracted or annoyed by its minimalism, I actually found that being able to see some of the goings-on in other parts of the town when the focus was in one particular house only added to the film's emotional impact, and what an impact it has - the first rape scene being a spectacular case in point. The fact that the performances are pitch perfect doesn't hurt either; Nicole Kidman is in career-best form. This film is definitely not for everyone and I'm not convinced that the ending completely worked, however in the same way that Breaking the Waves was an extremely uncomfortable but powerful viewing experience, I could not pull myself away.
B00005JKBC|4.0|I liked this movie more after watching it multiple times. It's not the kind of movie you necessarily enjoy watching over and over, but it is nice to watch after you've already unraveled the sometimes-confusing plot so that you can enjoy the show.     The movie follows two storylines, the first a flashback involving the relationship of CIA Field Manager Redford and his recruit-turned-protg Pitt. The current storyline involves Redford's efforts to save Pitt from the depths of a Chinese prison while the rest of the CIA is working to bury him.        Redford's character is pretty cool, with the street-smarts of a Harry Bosch combined with a slick comfort in the presence of administrators that Bosch could never muster. He is basically trying to redeem himself for a lifetime of morally ambiguous CIA dealings by putting his career and even freedom on the line on Pitt's behalf.        The camera cuts are gritty and fast-paced, without being so MTV'ed out that they distract from the story. The story is simple and intriguing, with the most pleasure coming from Redford's little tricks that, on the one hand, are so old fashioned that they wouldn't seem out of place in a quaint gumshoe noir, but on the other hand are just clever enough to be believable in foiling the CIA.        The movie bogs down in some of the flashbacks in my opinion, and the cuts from present to past and back again get slightly confusing if you're not paying close attention.
B000000YG5|5.0|The words inwhich I used to title my review, essential, classic, masterpiece, have all been manipulated to a certain extent but those words perfectly describe \\"Saxophone Collosus\\". Sonny rollins, aside from being a great saxophonist, was the kind of jazz musician who played the kind of jazz that people could really listen to. I don't mean Smooth, but understandable to a point where the average music fan, who likes all kinds, would listen to \\"Saxophone Collosus\\" and like it. Many mid to late sixties records from other labels like Impulse! or Bluenote were very obscure sounding and only few dedicated listeners could sit down and enjoy listening to them.  <br /> <br />Joining Rollins is the impeccable rhythmn section of Tommy Flanagan (piano), Doug Watkins (Bass) and Max roach (Drums). The Opener, \\"St Thomas\\", is a Rollins original and probably his most catchy sounding tune. He had previously been saxophonist in the Clifford Brown/Max Roach quintet where he and Roach developed a strong musical relationship, this may be some of their finest work together. \\"You don't know What love is\\" is a slow and very tasteful ballad, it has to be Sonny's best interpretation of a slower standard. Next is the upbeat \\"Strode rode\\" where Flanagan and Rollins get into the heavy groove. The latter 2 tracks are \\"Moritat\\" also known as \\"Mack the Knife\\", and \\"Blue seven\\" a medium groove blues. Both range over ten minutes long and provide plenty of solo space for everyone.  <br /> <br />This is an Essential, Classic, Masterpiece, with great bebop playing from Rollins and Co. Sometimes albums can get over-rated, not this. Five notes for Sonny Rollins greatest effort.
0783231202|4.0|A good serious movie about slavery. On the one hand, I like the level of realism shown in the capture and subsequent fate of a group of African men. On the other hand, the characters of the enslaved warriors doesn't receive the same level of realism, and I felt like there wasn't a bad soul among them. The few action scenes, notably an escape attempt in the opening, are handled with the usual Spielberg masterful touch. However, the bulk of the movie is talky and slow-moving, with a lot of heavy-handed moralism. It made me feel really awful about slavery, and gives you a real sense of the transition between their lives of freedom in Africa, and their captivity. In modern society, too much focus is put on American blacks after slavery; the stereotypes of the poorly educated negro are enduring, but the proud ancestry of black americans goes back further.
6304109318|4.0|In the great tradition of Gothic horror films, Mary Reilly updates the classic Robert Louis Stevenson novella, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  The screenplay by Christopher Hampton, from the novel by Valerie Martin, changes the focus from the bizarre transformation of Dr. Jekyll into Mr. Hyde, his evil alterego, and creates instead a tension-filled relationship between the dark and \\"misunderstood\\" Dr. Jekyll and his young and proper housemaid, Mary Reilly.  Despite (or perhaps because of) the abuse she has suffered at the hands of her father, Mary does not run from Dr. Jekyll, though she always seems fearful.  He confides in her about his research and gives her a sense of value which she does not receive from any other source.<br /><br />Julia Roberts as the very repressed Mary, plays most of the film through her expressive eyes, which reveal her fear and her moods.  Little dialogue is necessary, as John Malkevich, as both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, sneers, threatens, and dissembles, while also conveying a vulnerability to which Mary Reilly responds.  The cast of other house servants is outstanding, but Glenn Close as the off-the-wall madam Mrs. Farraday, steals the show, playing the role in her nastiest Cruella DeVille mode.  The Victorian setting is beautifully conveyed, from the claustrophic interiors of the bawdy house to the stark black and white interior of Jekyll's laboratory, and the costuming reflects the same color palette.<br /><br />The cinematography takes advantage of architectural components, filming from above catwalks in Dr. Hyde's laboratory, through windows, around doorways and halls, and from under tables.  Additional scenes of dark, foggy weather are used to great advantage as a contrast to the brightness and butchery in the markets, hospital autopsy rooms, and Mrs. Farraday's accommodations.<br /><br />The psychological portrait of Dr. Jekyll and his \\"evil twin,\\" Mr. Hyde have been discussed for over a hundred years, and this film does not add anything new to that portrait.  The inclusion of Mary Reilly, however, is a new twist, one which might have been more believable if her own psychological motivation for remaining in Dr. Jekyll's household had been more fully developed.  The special effects as Dr. Jekyll wrestles with his inner demon are compelling and unique, but the ending just peters out, offering no emotional resolution or intellectual conclusion regarding Mary Reilly. Great fun for fans of Gothic horror.  Mary Whippleanything new to that portrait.

B00003CXAT|4.0|When it came out, this was the epitome of the action movie, boasting amazing visuals, a fascinating and almost-believable plot device, and creative editing that gave an interesting spin to action sequences, as when a car, suspended in a tree, drives down the tree in a freefall. The actors and characters are beneath the level of achievement of the filmmakers, but that hardly matters as we are treated to a host of scary dinosaurs in a pleasing variety. Today, the things that made the film special have become commonplace, but the meshing of elements still places it near the top of groundbreaking monster flicks.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|As a boy who grew up in a working class neighborhood I had never heard an album as ubiquitous as this thing.  Everywhere you went it seemed one of these tracks was blaring from either the Monte Carlo peeling into the parking lot, or from the boomboxes entertaining backyard barbecues and frisbie in the park.<br /><br />Folks who were in their teens during the late 70s and early 80s can probably relate to what I'm describing.  Van Halen's Van Halen was the hot album, and it still holds up as arguably the best hard rock collection ever recorded.  Just good ol' party music that's at the top of its game when time comes to crank up the stereo and blow off steam.  It's nothing serious or pretentious and certainly contains no message except for a catchy hard rock vibe.  Of course Van Halen includes amazing guitar work and is simply Van Halen during its finest hour, before the stale \\"Jump\\" stuff and before the ostensible break-up.  Van Halen had a couple of albums after this one that were also quite good, but none of them compared to this baby.
B00005JNEI|4.0|It seems that a film documentarian has two main jobs. First, to shoot or find some compelling footage that keeps our interest; second, to assemble that footage in a way that tells a larger story or makes a significant point.     Moore has accomplished these two goals in spades, using footage from a wide variety of sources to build a damning case against President George Bush as pertains to the so-called war on terror.     My main criticism of the film comes from a conflicted frame of mind. On one hand, Moore has exaggerated facts and manipulated situations to such an extent that his film can't be truthfully labeled anything other than propaganda. On the other hand, the propaganda is in line with the daily rants of popular right wing radio hosts such as Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. When a liberal like Moore uses extremist methods to build an argument, it balances out their right wing extremism. But it also rings a little false now and again. I guess it's just not possible to have it both ways, but the coloring of the facts did leave me cold at times.        Highlights of the film include footage of a woman who lost her son in the Iraq war, which left my girlfriend and I wet-eyed. Testimony from US soldiers in Iraq also paints a picture of a majority who have desensitized themselves to the deaths they are causing through the use of bravado, and others who are miserable at the carnage they see around them.          In another segment, Moore shows the footage of Bush when he is told that the nation is under attack. Rather than respond with authority, Bush sits there for several minutes, reading a storybook to children as part of a promotional visit he had planned. Moore notes that no one told Bush what to do, and that his response was therefore to just sit there. Close ups of his face, slowed down to emphasize a nervous rocking, lead us to wonder what thoughts Bush was thinking, and to conclude that they were probably not the thoughts that we want our leadership to have.          Also of great interest to me were interviews with Iraqis, which humanized them, and footage of the aggressive recruitment tactics that Marine recruiters use in poor neighborhoods.          Some of the other segments worked less well for me, and the string of connections between the Bush administration, Saudi Arabia, and big oil was almost boring for me, since I had already read that the ties existed.     There is one great scene, however, in which Bush is seen joking at a dinner that he is addressing \\"the Haves, and the Have-Mores...some people call you the elite; I call you my base.\\" That is so disgusting.
B000002H6C|5.0|I'll say it again....where would metal be without this record ??? This was the first metal(lica) record I got and almost 17 years later it still gives me shivers. Ok, let's get the bad point out in the open first. Jason Newstead's bass is non-existent on this record. The day they remaster this with bass is the day I'll be running to the record store. Now the rest, every song is beyond words. The leads are great, the drums are fantastic and James Hetfield is shimmering on these record. The rhythm guitar is beyond words and to know for a fact that he did them all in one take is just downright awesome.His vocal delivery is the best he's ever done. I had never heard vocals so angry and simultaneously sad. His intensity has never been matched like it  has on Justice. This is Metallica's best. THe riffs are so heavy and the lyrics are excellant. Just buy it! It's a f@cking masterpiece.
B00004XPPB|3.0|This movie is based on a true story, and so gives us morally conflicted characters-too morally conflicted, if I can be picky (and I can). I like realism in a movie, but not at the expense of a good story, and while the descent of FBI agent into the world of mobsters is compelling, the end of the movie doesn't wrap up in the nice package I would have liked.  I do recall being really interested in the particulars of how Depp infiltrates the mob, and I think that revealing those details is what the film has to offer. Depp and Pacino both give solid performances.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I'm not usually one for orchestra music but this soundtrack is awsome. I would recommend it for anyone. I love listening to track #2, I think that one and #13 are my favorites. If you don't have this soundtrack you should. When I had gone to look for it to add to my cd's I couldn't find it anywhere that's how good it is. So if your looking for a new cd to get, buy the Fellowship of the Ring soundtrack.
078322804X|4.0|Classic story about two obsessive Blues musicians, Jake and Elwood, who become fixated on reconstituting their band after Jake is released from a long prison stint. Their characters meet every seemingly insurmountable obstacle with the same deadpan bravado, and there is a revolving door of humor stemming from their characters, musical numbers featuring the great living blues icons, and action scenes, the emphasis being on Smokey and the Bandit-style police car chases. The action scenes are so dated that they're mildly comical; the music and the comedy have borne the years well.
B000002KCC|5.0|TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT is an album full of lyrics describing the bleak horrors of drug addiction, but what's here could also be a warning not to get hooked on alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, or even junk food. In fact, the darkly cautionary words to most of the songs, particularly the title track (both parts), \\"Come On Baby Let's Go Downtown\\" (a years-old live recording sung by Crazy Horse Guitarist Danny Whitten before he OD'd), \\"Lookout Joe\\", and \\"Tired Eyes\\", along with Young's own \\"The Needle And The Damage Done\\" (the raw, stark LIVE RUST take, not the slightly antiseptic HARVEST version), \\"My My, Hey Hey (Out Of The Blue)\\", and \\"Hey Hey, My My (Into The Black)\\", and Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"The Needle And The Spoon\\" and \\"That Smell\\", inspire me to look at pictures of my favorite female celebrities as a motivation to keep it together in any situation conducive to self-indulgence and/or dangerous behavior. Although there are better Neil Young albums, none quite so much claws at the soul as TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT.
B0000399WI|5.0|Another Stephen King masterpiece that receives just the right touch on the big screen. The movie is extremely faithful to the short novel, and the few departures are just right. Everyone does a good job with the acting, and the dramatic prison escape in the ending is tear-inducing. There is some restraint on the triumph, as the old men who leave prison are different from the young men who entered. And the division of good prisoner/bad guard was a little too stark to be believed. Overall, though, this is a good movie that has something to say.
B000002UB3|5.0|ABBEY ROAD was the last studio recording the Beatles made together. It was a compromise between the inclinations of Lennon, who wanted to make singles, and McCartney, who wanted to make a huge statement. Lennon controlled the album up to and including \\"Come Together\\", while McCartney got his wish with two medleys that make up the majority of side two of my cassette. The piece \\"Carry That Weight\\" serves to me as a reminder that even though I've chosen not to attend certain functions at my old school in order to look good for my favorite female celebrities, the memories, as well as everything I learned, will always remain in my heart. Overall, a masterful work by the originators of modern pop.
B0002234LS|3.0|This movie, based on a short (or, actually, a long) story by Stephen King, is about a divorced writer who is suddenly confronted in his Maine summer home by an intense man named John Shooter, who accuses him of having plagiarized a story called Secret Window, Secret Garden. Shooter quickly becomes violent and ominous, and Rainey (Depp) tries to obtain a copy of a magazine in which the story was originally published, which predates Shooter's story by two years. As he tries to get the magazine that will prove his case, his dog is stabbed, his home is burned down, and a private detective he hires is murdered.  <br />   The one substantive departure from the book involved the supposition that other people could see a ghostlike version of John Shooter, and I don't think the movie suffered for the omission. It must have seemed like an unnecessary extra, given the strong twin plot lines of ongoing divorce and crazed stalker. I liked the balance between the scary stuff and the sadness of the divorce, and there were several very effective scary scenes, in which an unseen killer seems to be lurking just outside the edge of the audience's field of vision. Depp does his usual good job, this time giving us a character who is alternately emotionless and emotional, who want more than anything to wallow in depression by sleeping on the couch. Conversely, I thought that John Turturro stunk it up as John Shooter, a fact partially due to some extremely clunky dialogue that lent artifice to the southern accent. Maria Bello continues to inspire mixed feelings in me; I liked her quite a bit in \\"The Cooler,\\" but thought she was the weak link in Payback, one of my favorite all-time movies. I liked her in this, I think, and also liked Timothy Hutton as her new boyfriend.  <br />   I downgraded it a bit because of the dialogue, mostly, which intruded on many an otherwise fine scene.  <br />
B000002KDI|5.0|Neil Young's LIVE RUST is actually better than RUST NEVER SLEEPS because it includes songs from his entire career up to that point, including four songs from the prior album. Some critics downgraded this album on the grounds that he was simply recycling old favorites and repeating his newer songs, but their kids should be punished for their parents' sins in school with healthy doses of all-day Saturday detention, because this album is great. Two of the songs from RUST NEVER SLEEPS (\\"My My, Hey Hey (Out Of The Blue) and \\"Hey Hey, My My (Into The Black)\\") and the version here of \\"The Needle And The Damage Done\\" (better than the slightly soft-edged HARVEST version), along with much of TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT and the Lynyrd Skynyrd anti-drug songs \\"The Needle And The Spoon\\" and \\"That Smell\\", have inspired me to look at pictures of my favorite female celebrities as a motivation to be cautious in any situation conducive to overindulgence and/or dangerous behavior. Overall, this album is a must-have for any Neil Young collection, and along with EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS IS NOWHERE, AFTER THE GOLD RUSH, TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT, ZUMA, RUST NEVER SLEEPS, COMES A TIME, and several Edgar and Johnny Winter albums, proves that with a little effort, handicaps (Neil Young has epilepsy) can be overcome. The fact that Young, like most Southern, Midwestern, and California rockers, believes that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indoneia on drug-smuggling charges was unjustly convicted makes this, or any other Neil Young album, an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
B0000JCFPE|2.0|The crotch shot is the only bit of this heavy-handed erotic thriller that has remained in the popular imagination, and rightfully so. Sharon Stone's sexiness falls far short of the level of enthrallment Douglas accords it, and the bisexual psychologist is the only real sexy character (including, I'd say, Douglas). The action scenes are about average, and the plot becomes more convoluted than is justified by the payoff. Just because this raised the level of production values for erotic thrillers more commonly found on late-night Cinemax doesn't mean that it's truly escaped its tawdry roots.
B000001FA4|5.0|THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE is another great U2 album. \\"Pride (In The Name Of Love)\\", an homage to Martin Luther King, Jr., is a bit overplayed, but the title track and \\"A Sort Of Homecoming\\" are true gems. This was their second great album in a row (after a powerful debut, BOY, their sophmore disc, OCTOBER, had to be rush-written after the original lyrics disappeared), and the hot streak would continue up to and including ACHTUNG BABY, then pick up again with ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND and HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB.
B0001WANCM|3.0|Parodies of the \\"If you build it, they will come\\" line are far more prevalent than the movie itself. The basic idea is that Costner is moved to build a baseball diamond in his field; when he's done with the seemingly crazy scheme, it's populated by the ghosts of former baseball greats. I suppose this is a Costner highlight, but for a non-sports fan like me, the memory of the movie seems to fade.
B0002X314C|5.0|This is truly a stunning debut from the immensely talented John Legend. When I heard his first single \\"Used To Love U\\" I was immediately impressed and took a chance of buying his album after only hearing that song. I was completely blown away by not only his great music, but his very distinctive vocal delivery. He has production form Kanye West (of course), will.i.am (from the Black Eyed Peas), and John himself. Yes, his influences are apparent in the songs, whoever it doesn't come off as him imitating anyone else. His perfect blend of classic soul, hip-hop, Gospel, and r&b is a refreshing change in the scope of today's r&b music. He has sure to be classic songs such as, \\"Ordinary People\\", \\"Stay With You\\", and Refuge (When It's Cold Outside).\\" If you are looking for feel good music with a variety of topics from impefect love to love of family this the cd to buy. Actually regardless of the type of music you like, if you are a lover of great music this is a MUST HAVE CD!!!
B00061QJZI|3.0|Will Ferrell's first big comedy after Elf won't rake in the dollars that his holiday heartwarmer did, nor is it likely to go over as well with critics, who were able to forgive Elf's schmaltzy ending due to the imaginative gags. Anchorman is a pretty funny comedy, although there is nothing much to occupy our minds as we wait for the next funny joke. The movie takes a shotgun approach, spraying us liberally with jokes to see what sticks, and enough did that I was happy walking out of the theater. The storyline is pretty simple-Ron Burgundy is a bigshot local tv anchorman in the seventies, who is so entrenched in the way that things are that he can't even conceive of an aspiring female anchor as a threat. He quickly falls in love with said aspirant Applegate, but they break up as soon as her encroachment on his professional turf is too much to ignore. Happy ending, blah blah blah.
0446608955|5.0|After seeing the movie (which I thought was wonderful) I thought I'd give the book a try. Knowing how movies like to twist everything and change things here and there. One of the things they changed, was the play. Really it was a traditional play they did every year that Jamie's father had written about an angel. It makes WAY more sense. At the end of the movie I found myself wondering \\"Why was it named A WALK to Remember?\\", the book answers that question. This book is beautiful, it is very sad, but it is really good. The book made a lot more sense than the movie and I'd recommend it to anyone who saw and LOVED the movie. It's a very touching book and I wouldn't mind reading it a few more times.
B000002P5W|5.0|Jimi's second album and his third greatest after Are You Experienced & Electric Ladyland. There is severe beauty on this album. Worth your salary just for these 3 gems    Little Wing (The most beautiful thing I ever heard)  If 6 Were 9 (Awesome FUNKY,REBELIOUS AND Mitch Mitchell's Drums)  Castles MADE Of Sand (How does he play that good)    It sounds...crazy, but I can't believe this guy wasn't a being from another world. Coz he was seriously outta this world.
B000002UAX|1.0|I have never understood all the fuss over the Beatles. They couldn't sing, weren't good looking and played the same guitar music over and over that you can't even dance to. Britney Spears has much more talent and is alot cuter than they ever were. One more TIME, is the greatest pop album of ALLTIME...not any overatted Beatles album.
B000002U82|1.0|Don't buy this unless you want to fall asleep its BORING drivel. Britney Spears makes great music. One More Time has much better guitar riffs. And these guys are too...ugly to be popstars. Britney is cute. Buy Britneys albums instead for REAL music.
B00006879E|5.0|The best songs on this cd are This Love and Not Coming home everyone needs to get this cd <br />
B000000OSE|5.0|Use your Illusion I, the harder, rougher and tougher of the two albums are an absolutely dream for a Hard Rock fanatic. It contains some of the biggest songs in the 90`s, namely \\"Don`t Cry\\" and \\"November Rain\\", which made Guns N`Roses into something out of this world. Those songs are so absolutely incredible that its hard to explain just what makes them so, but there shouldnt be necessary with words. The songs explains it so perfectly.  <br /> <br />As I touched in the review for Illusion II, the quality, production and general songcrafting for both albums are extraordinary. Even today, 14 years after, not much can compare to the sound and the music found on these two albums. They are near perfection within Hard Rock, and they stand as two of the biggest highlights of the whole 90`s. Even today they are as fantastic as they were back in Fall 91. They even sound better today, compared to the \\"Rock\\" we are served now.  <br /> <br />Illusion I is perhaps a little weaker overall than II, not necessary worse, but different, a little less memorable perhaps. Unlike II however, the songs that really stand out here are the best the band ever made. Earlier mentioned, \\"Don`t Cry\\" and \\"November Rain\\" are the best ballads any rock band have made. The stunning epic \\"Coma\\" should be unlike anything you have ever heard, the furious \\"Garden of Eden\\" roars like thunder, the fun version of McCartney`s \\"Live and Let Die\\" is delightful, and the opening slammer \\"Right next door to hell\\" is as tough as they come.  <br /> <br />However, the album suffers a bit more of fillers than II. Really good fillers, thats for sure, but less interesting than the ones found on II. \\"Perfect Crime\\", \\"You Aint The First\\", \\"The Garden\\" and others are less memorable than most songs found on II, but it doesnt make them bad in any way. They are in fact pretty good, and they help make the album more varied. Axl is more of an Epic Writer, clearly evident in Coma and November Rain, while Stradlin prefers the more classic rock songs, possibly influenced by Aerosmith. This makes the songs on Illusion I differ quite a lot, and the result is a bit uneven. The album is on the whole not as enjoyable to listen to from start to end as Illusion II, but its as close as it can get. <br /> <br />A wise man once said \\"You need to feel pain to enjoy pleasure\\", and while its not as drastic, this holds true. Without the lesser songs, the good songs would easily become tiresome, so instead of pushing the score down, it stays perfectly safe on 5 stars. One of the best albums of the 90`s, Use Your Illusion I is only surpassed by Use Your Illusion II as THE Hard Rock Album of the 90`s.
0790736039|1.0|Why can't I take stars away from this movie? (minus one star)  This could be the worst movie ever made.  I did not read the book It is based on, so I can't compare the movie with the book.  But this movie has everything: wooden acting, absurd dialogue, clumsy direction, cheesy special effects, idiotic plot, silly ending, bad cinematography.  The only question is whether it is so bad as to be campy.  This may be the only movie ever made that is just bad, bad, bad.  I've seen home movies of a kid's birthday party that are more entertaining and suspenseful.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|The REAL first Greatest Hits album released, \\"Greatest Hits\\" does a mighty fine job of representing one of the best Hard Rock Bands in History. Its not perfect, actually far from it, because it lacks songs that were far better than most here, but it really does the job and it shows Guns N`Roses from their best side. <br /> <br />Straight to the tunes, here`s a little review for each song: <br /> <br />1: Welcome to the Jungle <br />An Absolute classic. The Intro is probably one of the Top Ten most famous and known Intro`s in history, it was probably a often cause of nasty neck pains after headbangings and sore fingers after Air Guitar playing. You cannot go wrong with it, Welcome to the Jungle is one of the trademarks of Rock. <br /> <br />2: Sweet Child of Mine <br />Along with Welcome to the Jungle and Paradise City, Sweet Child of Mine helped \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" to be one of the biggest albums in Rock. The Memorable Intro and the unique sound made this another classic. <br /> <br />3: Patience <br />From Lies!, Patience was a nice calm song that was quite haunting. It deserves as much credit as any other Guns N`Roses song, because it showed that the band could take their excellence down a few notches and turn it into a beautiful little ballad. <br /> <br />4: Paradise City <br />One doesnt really need to explain this. The Third song from Appetite for Destruction that made Guns N`Roses Superstar. The Intro is legendary. Whenever the song is played, people start singing. Its music history. <br /> <br />5: Knockin` On Heavens Door <br />A Misunderstood and overcritized version of Bob Dylan`s song, the Guns N`Roses version is a fun and sweet version that allows more people to connect to the original. Guns N`Roses probably ment the best when they made it, and while critics and media doesnt always make it look that way, this IS a great version that allows one to headbang while loving the original.  <br /> <br />6: Civil War <br />First song from Use Your Illusion II, this is a great song that combines strong lyrics and a haunting melody about the horror of War.  <br /> <br />7: You Could be Mine <br />A Thunderous, Hammering, Rock Solid powerhouse from Use Your Illusion II that shows just how fantastic Guns N`Roses was. It was nicely featured in the movie Terminator 2, and it seemed to go hand in hand with it. Jaw Breaking Rock at its best. <br /> <br />8: Don`t Cry(Original) <br />One of the finest Power Ballads ever made, this song perhaps one of the best and most important songs from Use Your Illusion. Haunting, Unforgettable, a love song extraordinaire, it showed the world that even a Hard Rock Band had a Heart and the ability to make better Ballads than any other band. <br /> <br />9: November Rain <br />If Don`t Cry wasnt enough, then the monster ballad November Rain surely made Guns N`Roses bigger than life. A Piano driven song that is backed up by awesome soloes and a heavy end part, it is one of the best, if not the best song they have ever made. The Video makes it even better, with fantastic shots of Slash outside a Church literally tearing through the solo. <br /> <br />10: Live and Let Die <br />While Live and Let Die is a good version of the old Paul McCartney classic, its not the best song Guns N`Roses have recorded, but considering the purpose of this album, it fits nicely. <br /> <br />11: Yesterdays <br />The first look at the title could lead someone to believe it was a Beatles cover at the first few moments, but luckily, its not like that. Its a nice original song that has a light tone, but its still a pretty good song.  <br /> <br />12: Ain`t it Fun <br />The Best song on The Spaghetti Incident Album, this raw and powerful song is probably the best representative of the last album Guns N`Roses released.  <br /> <br />13: Since I don`t have You <br />Less interesting than Ain`t it Fun, but still a fun and good song found on Spaghetti Incident. Its a good cover of the original, and one of the better on the last album. <br /> <br />14: Sympathy for the Devil <br />Not quite the best song they have covered, but one of the best versions. Guns N`Roses usually made very good coversongs, and the old Stones Song is not an exception. <br /> <br />What`s lacking from this Greatest Hits, is songs like \\"Estranged\\", \\"Locomotion\\" and \\"Coma\\", and other superior songs. This album is still a perfect way to start if you are new to Guns N`Roses, but your next stop should be Use Your Illusion I or II.
B00070QXL8|4.0|I dont have the dvd yet but i saw the movie and i loved it, although mot as much as the first one. I still found it funny and romantic and i will definitely buy it when the dvd comes out.
B000000OSG|5.0|Use Your Illusion I and II, released as seperate albums but still connected, are two of the best albums of the 90`s. Far more professional, miles of miles of better production and song crafting, melodies that surpass anything even 14 years after its release, the two albums have written themselves into history with amazing classicks like \\"Don`t Cry\\", \\"November Rain\\", \\"Civil War\\", \\"You Could be Mine\\" and other superb songs.  <br /> <br />They represent the absolute pineacle of Axl Rose and Company, and while the two albums kind of loose the charm of Appetite and Lies, they outweigh it by the simply incredible sounding music.  <br /> <br />Out of the two albums, Use Your Illusion II is after carefully consideration the better one. Its true that the First version of Don`t Cry(The one found on Illusion I) is better lyrically, and November Rain is probably their best song ever, but on the whole, Illusion II is so near perfect an epic Rock Album you can get. <br /> <br />The definitely best songs on Illusion II, is without a single doubt the epic and powerful \\"Estranged\\", the thundering and headbanging \\"You could be Mine\\", the impressive \\"Locomotive\\", of course the classic \\"Civil War\\", and other songs like \\"Get in the Ring\\", \\"Knocking on Heavens Door\\" and \\"Breakdown\\".  <br /> <br />These songs represent Guns N`Roses at their peak. Their musical capabilities are nearly unmatched, this much thanks to Saul Hudsons(Slash) out of this world`s guitarplaying. He IS one of the best guitarplayers in the world for a reason. Many have complained about Axl`s singing, but he has a special voice that is unlike anything. He can change his voice in tons of ways, to fit nearly any occation, and he nails it on the head on the two albums. In addition, the two Illusion albums shows how great songwriter he is. Axl and Slash was pretty much the face of Guns N`Roses, but the excellent work by Matt Sorum, Izzy Stradlin and Dizzy Reed was an important key for making the songs sound so powerful like they does.  <br /> <br />There is only one bad thing about Illusion II, and that is the only bad song, in fact, its pretty horrible, \\"My World\\". Just why its there, is a mystery, because its unlike anything they have done before, and it is really, really bad. Its not enough to reduce the pure 5 Stars it gets.  <br /> <br />While Use your Illusion II is the better album overall of I and II, you just cannot miss, in fact, if you like Guns N`Roses, or even Hard Rock Generally, you arent even allowed to miss these two albums. They are so superior to most other albums ever released, and they are two masterpieces that deserves the title as best albums released worldwide in 91. Perhaps even in the whole 90`s. <br />
B000001FFJ|5.0|After seeing Tom sing \\"Tango Till They're Sore\\" on David Letterman when I was 19, I rushed out to buy Rain Dogs the next day.  I have listened to it more than any other single album that I own and never get tired of it.  Now that I am older, with three kids, listening to the album is a completely different experience for me.  It's evocative of that time in my life, when I could stay up drinking till 4 am and still show up for class at 8, but it's so much more.  Poignant, profound, and moving as ever, this album will always be near and dear to my heart.  I give it a 5 and this is the only review I've posted on Amazon.
B000000P17|4.0|I have to admit, back when this album was released, I was in the midst of my Guns N`Roses craze, and before this was released, I thought it would be their \\"Next\\" Album just like Use Your Illusion I and II(Which are two of the best albums ever). I was pretty surprised though, when I got it, that it didnt sound like Guns N`Roses anymore. Little did I know back then that it wasnt actually their music, but covers of old classic Rock and Punk songs. So, when I got it, I played it to death, and I actually liked it pretty much, but it really didnt feel like the Guns N`Roses I had grown to love on Use Your Illusion. This is, for some, a blessing, for others, a Curse.     Gone is the epic and grand sound, replaced with dirty fast punk influenced rock. Its the type that you could hear traces of in a few songs on Use Your Illusion I, but that was in minority. However, one cannot blame Guns N`Roses for not sounding like them, it was after all coversongs, and what they did, was make it sound great. They did succeed making the old songs sound fascinatingly good, and the album is very good overall.    Absolute Standouts are the Radio Hit and personal favorite \\"Ain`t It Fun\\", the heavy thunderous \\"Black Leather\\", the fun \\"Down on the Farm\\", the fast \\"Attitude\\" and \\"I dont care about you\\". Good old songs like \\"Hair of the Dog\\" and \\"Since I dont have you\\" are covered nicely, and the original artists would be proud that a band like Guns N`Roses honored their music.     Unfortunately, it wasnt the album many had hoped for, and while the band had some hugely successful concerts afterwards, it marked the end of the band. Ending it with Coma would have been ten times better, but \\"I dont care about you\\" is also a nice way to show that Guns N`Roses always was about being themselves, and not caring about others. It was part of what made them one of the biggest bands in History. They had soul. They had Guts. They made the best Hard Rock ever. They walked their way, they became kings of Hard Rock and they became legends.
1577311523|5.0|In looking over other reader's comments on this and Tolle's Practicing book as well, I thought I'd chime in with my thoughts.   <br />From what many others have said there is something in this book that resonates on a very deep level in people.  Other's have put it down stating that the information is regurgitated from other spiritual paths.  I'd have to agree with those who have been positively affected by this book.  I've had my fair share of exploring many spiritual paths, searching for that bit of hidden wisdom that was never there to start with.   <br /> <br />For the past 15 years I've been a practicing Buddhist (if I had to label myself and what I do)  I've always been wary of those who claim to have the knowledge and can transmit it to others through teachings.  I've respect for the Lamas and Rinpoche's and all those in the Sangha but to me something still has not seems correct.  So many \\"religions\\" place emphasis on what will happen if we don't do or be or think this or that.  To even think this way is projecting something with our mind on a future that doesn't even exist.  We create what we think will happen (Tolle calls this Psychological Time) in our minds and project this into another time and all the while completely forgetting that right now, we're here in this moment.  It's a very simple idea.  As I've typed this the moment has past and is now just a trace memory.   <br /> <br />To those who say this is just regurgitated information from other spiritual paths, I'd say so what?  Most religious systems overlap and some more than others.  Buddhist/Hindu...Jewish/Christian/Muslim, etc. etc.  What's important is how it affects the person absorbing the information. <br /> <br />I'd recommend reading this book even though I haven't completed it myself.  I've read quite a bit and this is one that I can truely state I got something good out of in the first few pages. <br /> <br />If you're spirituality leads you to inquiring about the information in this bookthen I'd recommend you just read it.  I typically do not decide to read or not read based on other peoples reviews or experiences because they are at heart, someone else's and not mine. <br /> <br />Read it...it's only a small amount of money compared to what you might truely get from it.
B0000AQVCL|1.0|OMG, there's a new band that's bringing back rock from the days of AC/DC! You gotta check 'em out! Yeah, right. Jet is just a cheap imitation of AC/DC. The lead singer is annoying and the guitar riffs sound JUST LIKE AC/DC. If you're such a fan of classic rock, then just listen to classic rock. We don't need any more cheap imitations of classic rock, just be original. That's why AC/DC was such a great band.
B00024BHTC|5.0|Many of the reviews here are very poor - it is bad to rate an album based on previous albums, considering that the particular album could still be top notch compared to other commercial albums out there.  This album suffers just that - it may not be as enjoyable as previous ones to some people, but it still is above the cut. Nightwish brought on board an orchestra, the same orchestra that Pip Williams used to record the Lord of the Rings soundtrack, and the production in this album far surpasses the others, and puts it in a class of its own.  But for the songs themselves, the most grabbing ones are Dark Chest of Wonders (a gorgeous mix of metal with orchestration and Tarja's vocals), Wish I Had an Angel (an extremely successful marrying of heavy metal with techno beat), Dead Gardens, and Ghost Love Score (the arrangement for the orchestra is amazing, and the sections of the song, especially the piratesque section, just engrosses you completely with the tale told by the lyrics).  Creek Mary's Blood also boasts of a similar style as Ghost Love Score, except with a different tale to tell.  Planet Hell and Romanticide are more standard Nightwish symphonic black metal.  Nemo pulls at your heart, bringing a yearning for more.  Kuolema Tekee Tajteilijan is a nice sorrow-laden song.  Higher than Hope ends the album in a great choral bang. <br /> <br />However, as addicting this album is, I cannot recommend this as a Nightwish album newcomers should start off with.  Wishmaster and/or Century Child are much better albums to start off with since Once is an evolution of styles prevalent in those two albums.  Fans of more grittier metal bands might enjoy this more easily though and probably would prefer to start off with this one.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|After viewing \\"Troy,\\" I really seen all what went wrong with Alex.  Brad Pitt was a perfect choice as Achilles.  He is certainly fit for the part, and has enough acting muscle to pull off such a role without being campy or wooden.  The direction was clear and exact.  The rest of the cast was perfect, the sets, costumes, musical score--everything was epic in nature as was the story it was telling.  This IS fine filmmaking.  An epic movie that was done right.  It told its story in an entertaining AND educational way.  The battle sequences were spectacular!  A little bloody, graphic, but well staged and beautifully shot.  Certainly one of the best films of the year, or any year.  I rank it with \\"Lawrence of Arabia,\\" \\"Braveheart,\\" and \\"Gladiator.\\"
1401301010|5.0|I love biographies and I love music, so Scar Tissue seemed to be a safe bet.  Apparently it was, since I read 465 pages in two days.  While RHCP remains relatively low on my music radar, I still appreciate their distinctive creativity and talent.  What I am getting at is that you need not be a huge RHCP fan to appreciate Anthony's candid, sometimes painful story.  I found Anthony's sexual escapades to be rather amusing, as opposed to sexist or demeaning.  It's a fact of life that groupies will do all kinds of stupid and repugnant  things to/for their rock demigods.  I thought his perspective was interesting and I appreciated his openness.  I actually give Anthony credit for bringing in Ratso to help him with this book.  With the help of a professional, he put aside his ego in order to create a well-written, organized novel of his otherwise chaotic life.  It was an amazing read and it's even more amazing that this man has lived to tell his tale.  Most of all I am thankful that I am a Normie and have never had to face battling addiction.  That must really suck.
B000002J09|5.0|A superb treat for all fans of CLASSIC ROCK. Worth the money just for Stairway, which is the holy grail of rock anthems. Overplayed on the radio they may have been. But that was for good reason. <br /> <br />
B0006A9FMI|1.0|Bought this DVD from the store, got home and put in to watch.  The opening scene is a panoramic view of the city and all of a sudden the so-called subtitles come on with \\"[crowd noise]\\" which can in fact be heard on the soundtrack.  Next, you can hear a helicopter and the subtitles pop back up with \\"[helicopter approaching]\\".  And guess what?  There's no way to turn this feature off.  DreamWorks Entertainment, whose logo is on the DVD box, apparently thinks that a closed captioning track for deaf viewers is the same thing as English subtitles for a foreign language film.  Well, I watched those first 30 seconds, tried to turn off the close captioning and realized I couldn't, and promptly popped the disc right back out of the player.  It is getting returned to the store first thing tomorrow.  There is simply no excuse for this kind of inept product.  If you are a true fan of cinema, I think you will probably share my view that you cannot watch a movie with closed captioning distracting you during every scene. <br /> <br />This really makes me angry as I have been waiting anxiously to see this film.  The original was incredible and we had to wait so long for a sequel.  Guess us American viewers will have to keep waiting until a watchable version comes out here.  Shame on you DreamWorks!!!
B000002UAU|3.0|I feel this album rests on the quality of 2 songs. \\"A DAY IN THE LIFE\\" (BY FAR THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM) AND \\"GETTING BETTER\\". There is alot of filler on this album after those 2 great songs. So I don't think as a whole it stands up to the truly great \\"Revolver\\". Which I really believe is their MASTERPIECE!!!
B0006213WG|1.0|Sum 41 is on the way out.  They are a washed up pop punk band, and this album is a last ditch attempt to make some more money before the clock runs out, and they have to go back to their jobs at the local \\"Burger King\\" fast food establishment. <br /> <br />Their popularity is going downhill because they are a flavour of the month novelty act.  Their fans are simply getting tired of the band.  These guys have about as much staying power as the Spice Girls or Hanson.  Remember those groups?  Thats where Sum 41 will be in another year or two. <br /> <br />I can't recommend this CD to anybody.  The only reason to buy this CD is if you want to waste your money.
B000002KY8|4.0|Forget Michael Jackson. This guy Prince was the greatest talent of the 80s and as close a talent to Jimi Hendrix as black music has seen since. He took the 80s sound and made it move with a clever blend of synths, guitars, female backing vocals and guts. <br /> <br />1999 & Little Red Corvette are CLASSICS!
B00005QG9J|5.0|AMAZING CD!!! you have to buy it!! well, actually it takes awhile for anyone who's never heard of incubus to get to realyy like them, they have GREAT guitar by mike, awesome voice by brandon, good bassist ben and the ultimate drummer jose, not to mention the turn table master dj kilmore. I saw these guys in toronto, what a great concert.<BR>Being a long time fan, I'd have to say that this is by far their best cd. Along with this cd theres a dvd which is also reaaaaly good. You might have heard their song &quot;drive&quot;. Anyways, give them a chance!
B0000025RI|5.0|When this album was in the charts MJ was the King of Pop. He really has fallen from grace since then. But this album remains by far his best work. Billie Jean and Human Nature are top tunes. And Beat It is a catchy rock stomper. Worth buying anyhow.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|This collection has nearly everything.  I did miss the funny extras you would get if you purchased the movies separetly (such as the MTV movie awards parody(reloaded)).  Instead each of the movie disks comes with 2 commentaries: one with the critics and one by the philosophers.  And with the animatrix and all the extras like the video-game movie shoots and all the making of clips I have enriched my knowledge of this parellel universe we lovingly call the matrix.<br /><br />I highly recommend this collection, for the money it is definatly worth it.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|As a big gothic rock fan i was tempted to listen to Nightwish. Overall i love the perfect balence of The orchestras and guitars, accompinied by great vocals (Besides the male) Here is a list of the tracks and what i think: <br />1 Dark Chest of wonders- a great song with a great melodie and smooth transitions <br />2. I wish i had an angel- Not the best song on the soundtrack. The male vocals bring the greatness of the song down, the melody is not as appealing <br />3. Nemo- the whole reason i bought this album. Great Song <br />4.Planet hell- enjoyed this song as well, great guitair <br />5.Creek mary's Blood- When i first heard this i instantly skipped it. Then listening to it all the way i realized i liked its originality <br />6. Siren- I don't like this song. it is not as original as the others <br />7. Dead gardens- Another great song with a perfect balence <br />8.Romanticide- Love the melody and the gutairs. Truly great vocals too <br />9. Ghost love score- My favorite song on the album Great orchastra with incredibal transitions. Love the chorus and reminds me of pirates of the caribbean <br />10. Kuolema Tekke Taiteilijan - I haven't listened to this song yet <br />11. Higher than hope- Starts a little slow, but picks up at the chorus. Great vocals. Another strong song
B0002S94OS|5.0|This is a sensational release which ups the ante as far as brutality matched with sophisticated songwriting is concerned. I have been generally disappointed with recent releases from the likes of Killswitch Engage and Shadows Fall. I had heard some Lamb Of God stuff but up until now I hadn't been impressed enough to buy anything. I picked up a second hand copy of this at the same time as buying something else, and haven't stopped playing it since. They remind me a little of Napalm Death at their absolute best, but only a little, this is a beast of it's own making. Beware that the record company has seen fit to issue an edited \\"Ned Flanders\\" version to mute naughty swear words, so make sure you get the uncensored version. It's not as if they've got Tourettes anyway. Late entry along with Isis' \\"Panopticon\\" for best heavy release of 2004.
B00000J2SR|4.0|I've just bought this cd, and I like it very much. My favorite songs on this album are: 'Fire Dance' and 'Drinking with the Devil'. The rest of the songs are very good also. The songs 'Anybody there' and 'Snowman' are instrumental. I dont like that. 'Anybody there' is okay, but 'Snowman' is just boring. But the rest of the songs are very good. 'Street of dreams' became a great hit. I have to say that I like 'Straight between the eyes' better than this album. But that doesn't mean that I dont recommend this album to you! If you are a Rainbow fan, you must have this album. Highly recommended!
0385335482|5.0|I am addicted to these books. This is the first of a series of fun, fast reads. Becky Bloomwood is a character that not everybody can relate to, but everybody should root for. Sure, some of the situations she gets herself into are far fetched, but they sure are amusing. And it's fun trying to guess what the next title will be. \\"Shopaholic Gets Pregnant\\"? \\"Shopaholic Gets Divorced\\"? Can't wait!
B00000JCOV|1.0|When I first started downloading some of their songs, I wanted to give it a try and what were the results? A chock full of untalented crap played by a bunch of retards. Seriously, how can anyone call this \\"Death Metal\\" or even worse, \\"Metal\\"? Is it because of the loud guitars and the drumming? Give me a f**king break. This pathetic excuse for music deserves nothing constructive for reviewers like me. Corey Taylor sings good? Hell no. He whines, screams, shouts, and wails to get his abysmally horrible lyrics across. Joey a good drummer? Well, most true metalheads say that he has talent but he is wasting many of it in a band full of untalented crap. Nine members? Preposterous. Why would a band recruit nine people? The nine people in this s***y band are one vocalist, three guitarists (one with a bassist), one real drummer, two extra percussionists, and two DJs. That is just too much to ask, plus it is ridiculously unnecessary. And people who like this band, mostly the \\"maggots\\" who call themselves, like to arrogantly insult other people who hate this band. Well, let me tell you, you so-called asinine \\"maggots\\". Slipknot is not METAL. It is crappy mallcore music for the retarded people like you jackasses. Plus, in another review,  a smart reviewer said that the band members are just as retarded like you \\"maggots\\". He said that if you hit Corey in the head with a baseball bat, he would laugh. You know what I think? I think you would be dead or otherwise go to the hospital if you passed out from the concussion. And I also heard that the DJ will hate anyone who breathe oxygen and let it in his body. So he puts a gas mask on his face. What in the hell is he thinking? Oxygen does NOT KILL YOU!!! YOU NEED OXYGEN TO BREATHE, YOU ASININE RETARDS OF SLIPKNOT!!!    So, if anyone comes up with a name like \\"SLIPKNOTMAGGOT666\\", \\"SLIPKNOT WILL NEVER DIE\\", or \\"WE WON\\"T DIE666\\", do not trust anyone of those kind of people.    How ironic that maggots are festering bugs that live on [...] of dead people.
0385335482|5.0|This book was an easy, fun read!  I really love Becky.  I loved all of her excues to her creditors--especially when she throws in that she's found Jesus and accepted him as her savior!  What a hoot!  Oh, and I loved the ending and Luke Brandon (what a dream, and what a dreamy name).
B0006A9FMI|1.0|As others have stated, this release doesn't have the normal subtitle track.  I wonder if anyone from Dreamworks has ever been in a video store and realizes that the anime section takes up about 10% of all the shelf space, and that there isn't a single other title that only has a CC subtitle release.  QED, Dreamworks messed up. <br /> <br />What really gets to me is that Dreamworks has addressed this issue at a popular Anime DVD website and has basically stated that they were doing us a favor by releasing the subtitles as CC.  I mean, really, how insulting is that. <br /> <br />Everyone should return this DVD if already purchased and contact Dreamworks directly to let them know this isn't acceptable.
B000056NX5|4.0|The new re-working of \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\" is not without its flaws.  Because the cast is made up almost entirely of stage actors, techniques designed to be visible to a back-row audience seem over-acted when filmed in closeup.  Glenn Carter as Jesus is not as charismatic as he could be, and after multiple viewings, I'm still not quite sure what to make of Rik Mayell's performance as King Herod. <br /> <br />However, Michael Shaeffer and Frederick B. Owens make an excellent dark duo.  The apostles are energetic and talented.  Tony Vincent's \\"Simon Zealotes\\" is a standout.  Carter has a good voice, which is put to good use in songs like \\"Gethsemane.\\"  <br /> <br />And then, there is Jerome Pradon.   <br /> <br />When I first saw \\"Jesus Christ Superstar,\\" I was skeptical of Pradon's performance as Judas, largely because of his high notes, and the fact that he was not hitting them.  I was disappointed and wished a stronger singer, like Tony Vincent, had been given the role instead.  It wasn't until someone directed me to the Paris revival recording of \\"Les Miserables\\" (Pradon played Marius) that I realized that Pradon CAN hit those notes.  It's Judas who can't.  This seems very appropriate, as it stacks up as yet another thing Jesus has that Judas does not - the respect of large numbers of people, good looks, a beautiful woman, etc.  At the end of the show, during the song \\"Superstar,\\" we see Judas as he would have liked to be, singing almost pitch-perfect as he mocks Jesus.   <br /> <br />Aside from this smart singing choice, Pradon is absolutely fascinating to watch.  He plays the part superbly, putting his facial expressions to excellent use, and utilizing his entire body as Judas descends into madness.  Though \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\" is truly about the fall of Judas Iscariot, many production try to place the focus on Jesus.  However, every time Pradon is onscreen, he rightfully steals the show back to where its focal point should be.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|According to Homer's \\"The Illiad\\" (which may or may not have been based on an actual event), the love between Trojan prince Paris and Helen of Troy caused the great city of Troy to fall. Similarly, Wolfgang Petersen's epic \\"Troy\\" nearly falls itself.<br /><br />The storytelling is fairly weak. The set-up for the tale goes by too fast, and little time is spent on really getting to know many of the characters of the film. The battle sequences are big and well-crafted with fantastic choreography and breathtaking CG effects, but they lack both the excitement and emotion that were clearly evident in Oliver Stone's superb epic \\"Alexander.\\"<br /><br />The casting is also a problem. Like most other people, I agree that Brad Pitt was miscast as Achilles. I've never liked Pitt as an actor, and the character is portrayed more as an anti-hero. Brian Cox does not make Agememnon a convincing leader, or villain for that matter. Orlando Bloom seems to still be channeling Will Turner from \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" in his portrayal of Paris.<br /><br />However, there are some great performances. Eric Bana is great as Hector. I rooted for him in the one-on-one battle with Achilles, even though I knew what the outcome would be. Peter O'Toole is great at giving Trojan King Priam a Shakespearean feel. Sean Bean is great as Odysseus. If they ever do \\"The Odyssey,\\" he should be approached to do so. It is these performances that make the 162-minute film bearable.<br /><br />Overall, the film is mostly a letdown. It has some good moments in terms of acting and battle, but I recommend \\"Alexander\\" as the best \\"Sword and Sandals\\" epic of 2004.

B000696PWC|5.0|Not that that's a bad thing...considering that she's released three albums since her last one. This collection is definitely what the title suggests....the ultimate Kylie collection. <br /> <br />This features pretty much all of her European/US pop hits from her breakthrough days with \\"the Locomotion\\"...then you get her strictly European dance hits such as \\"Step back in Time\\" and \\"Better the Devil You Know.\\" Next, we get the cult hits from her \\"experimental period\\" such as \\"Did it Again\\" and \\"Confide In Me.\\" *takes a breath* This is followed by her European dance comeback hits from \\"Light Years\\" which are \\"Spinning Around\\" \\"Please Stay\\" and \\"On A Night Like This.\\" Then her biggest worldwide hit \\"Fever\\" is represented with the worldwide hits *including the US* \\"Can't Get You Oughta My Head\\", \\"Love At First Sight\\"a nd \\"Come Into My World.\\" Then finally you get the \\"ok\\" tracks from her latest album such as \\"Slow\\" and the much better \\"Red Blooded Woman.\\" <br /> <br />There's a wide variety of music represented here! Kylie is very hip and always comes up with a fresh/sound and style. She is definitely the European Madonna. Even though this is an import, the US release is coming out in February!
B000002U82|5.0|It is a true testament to an album's worth when it is on the Billboard 200 for a few years. But 14 years? Only Pink Floyd has had an album on the charts for that long. That's not a fluke. Some of the greatest albums in the world haven't even come close to that. \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is the fourth-bestselling album of all-time, and the bestselling rock album. <br /> <br />It almost isn't fair to rate/review each song on Dark Side, as the album plays as one continuous song. Nobody had done that before Dark Side, and nobody has been able to do the same since. This truly was a groundbreaking album, and I haven't even gotten into the sound effects yet. <br /> <br />Dark Side of the Moon was one of the first albums to sample certain sound effects in almost every one of the songs. From the heartbeat in \\"Speak to Me/Breathe\\" to the synthesizer in \\"On the Run\\" to the cash registers of \\"Money,\\" the effects play an integral role in Dark Side. Now, onto the songs themselves. <br /> <br />1. \\"Speak to Me/Breathe\\" - A very good intro to the album. Starts off with a heartbeat and slowly moves into \\"Breathe,\\" a very slow, relaxing song. 8/10 <br /> <br />2. \\"On the Run\\" - Full of synthesizers and cymbals. A decent song, but it drags on for too long in my opinion. 7/10 <br /> <br />3. \\"Time\\" - A true masterpiece in the history of music. Easily one of Pink Floyd's best. It starts out with clocks ringing, which is followed by an excellent drum section. Then the song really begins and the listener is taken on a euphoric journey of the senses. Never before has a song captured my imagination quite like this one. 10/10 <br /> <br />4. \\"Great Gig in the Sky\\" - The wailing and screaming of the lady gets annoying in a few spots, but this is still a good song. 8/10 <br /> <br />5. \\"Money\\" - This might be Pink Floyd's most overrated song. It seems that most casual fans have heard this song, and they love it. While it's certainly not a bad song, it's not as great as some people proclaim it tobe. 9/10 <br /> <br />6. \\"Us and Them\\" - A very good song. The lyrics are simple yet effective. Nothing too flasy in terms of instruments or sound effects. There's something about this song that just makes it work. 9/10 <br /> <br />7. \\"Any Color You Like\\" - This might be one of Pink Floyd's most underrated songs. I love the way \\"Us and Them\\" transitions into it, and I love the way this transitions into \\"Brain Damage.\\" There are no lyrics, but that does not hinder the song in any way. 9/10 <br /> <br />8. \\"Brain Damage\\" - A true tribute to the great Syd Barrett. This song might have the best lyrics of any song on the album. The line \\"And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes/I'll see you on the dark side of the moon\\" is one of the best lines every written. This song will really move you in an evocative way. 10/10 <br /> <br />9. \\"Eclipse\\" - This is a very good ending to a remarkable album. It basically crescendoes throughout until it fades out with a beating heart; it's a very powerful song, and very well written. 10/10 <br /> <br />Dark Side of the Moon is the best album I've ever heard, period. Every song is good and quite a few of them are just great. No other album I've heard has spoken to me as intimately as Dark Side. This album captures my imagination and takes it on a far-greater ride than anything else I've heard. Dark Side of the Moon is the quintessential rock album and a must-buy for anyone.
0743455967|5.0|He's a recovering alcoholic with a sort of oddball childhood and a (single) mother who loved him and his brother fiercely, and was a writer because he was a reader, as far back as he can remember. He's brilliantly smart. He writes to make sense of his world (and a strange and scary world it is, sometimes) and because he likes stories. As a writer, this book punched me in the gut and made me teary-eyed a few times because -- reading it, I simply felt like Steve King \\"gets me.\\" When he and his wife and baby are living hand-to-mouth and he gets paid six figures for \\"Carrie,\\" if you don't get thrilled for him...you should get your heart checked out.
B00005JMAH|3.0|...on Harry Potter, but I felt something was missing in this one. And I haven't even read any of the books - so my dissapointment on the movie (and the somewhat \\"pale\\" story supposed to be ever so dark) does not lie there. <br /> <br />Well, I enjoyed the previous two - Harry Potter like Lord Of The Rings had become almost like a Christmas-tradition over here in Norway - adventure based on a bit \\"childish\\" imagination, lots of laughs and fun. And great effects, good actors and superb locations. <br /> <br />And speaking of locations: Isn't Galtvort looking very different, including the surroundings and Hygrids' little house. Where did that hill come from? Not important, but the place seemed so unfamiliar in the third movie - or is it just me? I just didn't recognize myself there, that's all... <br /> <br />Other than that I find the movie a little boring, and though it is a childrens' movie (adult too of course) it could have been a little more scary, and more entertaining that way. The previous two were a lot better, in my opinion - and a lot more \\"flowing\\", if you get my meaning, when it comes to the story.  <br /> <br />Lokking forward to the next!
B0006OBPTA|4.0|This collection set is a great news to all Karate Kid fans who haven't owned the complete four films yet. Even though there's not much extra features or fancy box set wrapping around them, I think the attractive low price for this 4-pack is the major factor for driving people's desire of ownership. About the films, both the I and II are the best in the series. The III is an average work. The IV is totally off, only Miyagi is from the original casts. About the DVD, unlike the disappointed 1.33:1 aspect ratio in the original Karate Kid I DVD, in this set all four films are republished in widescreen format for true collectors. I think this 4-pack is an excellent deal! Cann't wait to see.....Wax On, Wax Off, Sand the floor, and Paint the house. <br /> <br />(Reviewed by Otto Yuen, 05-Jan-2005) <br />
B00005ASHM|3.0|This review is coming from a casual fan with no particular axe to grind.  I had heard of \\"Pet Sounds\\" before, but I'd never actually heard any of the album itself until recently.  Obviously, I knew who the Beach Boys were.  Everybody does.  There are probably more people out there who know the lyrics to \\"California Girls\\" than to \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\".  But \\"Pet Sounds\\" was different:  some reviews (like the Amazon.com editor) called it the greatest album ever made.  Here's my take on \\"Pet Sounds\\":  Firstly, this is not the greatest album ever made.  Indeed, the very idea is ridiculous.  It has two songs that are truly great, \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" and \\"Sloop John B\\".  Both were Top Ten hits in 1966 and deservedly so;  they're both terrific.  \\"Pet Sounds\\" also has two songs that I would call ... interesting, \\"God Only Knows\\" and \\"Caroline, No\\".  They're both thoughtful, introspective ballads;  In 1966, both barely cracked the Top Forty.  Now, as for the rest of it ... listening to this album, it was pretty clear to me what the Beach Boys were trying to do.  \\"Pet Sounds\\" might alternately be called \\"The Beach Boys Get Serious\\".  From 1962 to 1965 the Beach Boys churned out no less than 16 Top Forty hits, all about the subjects of sun, sand and surf.  By the mid 1960's, American popular music was trending in different directions and it's obvious that \\"Pet Sounds\\" was an attempt by the Beach Boys to respond to that.  \\"Pet Sounds\\" strikes me as an attempt by the Beach Boys to re-invent themselves as a kind of folk-rock band along the lines of the Byrds, or even an experimental musical group like what you might have heard patronized by a young Andy Warhol.  In the event the exercise is totally misconceived;  the Beach Boys and folk music (much less experimental music) are a complete mismatch.  Songs like \\"I'm Waiting for the Day\\" and \\"Here Today\\" come off as 1960's-era curiosities;  they have all the bounce and tempo of folk-rock, but the melodies just aren't there.\\"I Know There's an Answer\\" is similarly uninteresting musically and has all the pretentiousness of folk-music (\\"I Know There's an Answer\\"?  Okay.  Fine.  What was the question?).  Some of the songs, like \\"Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)\\" and the instrumental \\"Let's Go Away for Awhile\\" are so off-beat and amorphous, I really think the Beach Boys were going for a kind of art-house effect.  I haven't heard anything this strange since the last time I went to the Guggenheim Museum.  Maybe this is all just too deep for me.  Maybe I just don't get it.  Maybe a more-educated ear could hear a brilliance in all this that I'm just not hearing.  Maybe.  But what I think I'm hearing is a pretentious, self-indulgent, 1960's period-piece, an experiment that failed, a serious mis-step by the Beach Boys. There are a few good things in this album.  For example, \\"You Still Believe in Me\\" has all the air of an opening invocation or prayer;  when the music rises to a crescendo and all the Beach Boys chime in, the sound is glorious, like nothing less than an angelic choir.  It's in a moment like that that \\"Pet Sounds\\" crystallizes into something truly extraordinary.  Unfortunately, those moments are disconnected and few.  \\"Pet Sounds\\" is a grab bag of good ideas:  songs that suddenly start and stop, changes in tempo, a squeezebox opening to \\"I Know There's an Answer\\", and lots of brilliant studio trickery.  But ultimately an album rises or falls on the strength of its songs and here the songs just aren't very good.  It's a lot of studio gimmickry put to the service of some pretty pedestrian music.  Listening to \\"Pet Sounds\\", it's also abundantly clear from where other more-inspired musical groups got some of their best production ideas (four lads from Liverpool come to mind;  I can't remember the name of the group).  What's missing from \\"Pet Sounds\\" is an overall integrated musical vision, something that would connect those good ideas together into a completed album of beautiful music.  I can't see \\"Pet Sounds\\" as being of interest to anybody other than a musical historian.  \\"Pet Sounds\\" is really more significant for what it influenced than for what it is.
1592400876|2.0|\\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves\\" may sound like the condensed plot of a modern Hollywood action movie, but it's really about punctuation--as in, the incorrect use thereof.  Unfortunately, author Lynne Truss is no humorist; she tries to milk this single theme for all it's worth, but all she manages is tedious repetition in the manner of a Benny Hill marathon.  Ms. Truss would like to punish punctuation abusers, we learn on the first page.  And on the second.  And on the third.  And on the....
B0000CEB4V|4.0|Yes, \\"Concert for George\\" is worth the money (all profits to the filmmakers go to Eric Clapton's charity). <br /> <br />Yes, George Harrison loved the sitar and other Indian/exotic instruments. <br /> <br />No, he like most other people didn't care for whiney Indian screeching. <br /> <br />No, simply being someone's wife isn't enough reason to be allowed to sing in a music tribute.  Don't get me wrong, Mrs. Shankar looks like a very nice lady.  But good Lord, that voice of hers still keeps me awake at night.  Shades of Yoko. <br /> <br />Yes, George Harrison was as tired of \\"The Lumberjack Song\\" and \\"Sit on my Face\\" as everyone else. <br /> <br />You'll probably find yourself skipping over the first segment of this video, and perhaps the second as well.  As Harrison himself likely would have done.  But what remains is still an exceptional performance and well worth the money.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|This is a remarkable set of DVD's, for sure!  Any show sponsored by the World's preeminent guitarist, Eric Clapton, is sure to be excellent!  But, this show had unrealistic expectations of being entirely presented on this two-pack DVD set, I think.  There were just too many quality artists involved to permit each of them to be adequately accomandated on this set.  I believe that there will be much more yet to be seen! The \\"plum\\" of the festival was certainly the one song that Jeff Beck performed with Clapton, and it was mysteriously deleted from this set dramatically just days before it went into production, (if the media is to be believed).  A second set featuring this performance, along with a good helping of Buddy Guy's set, is certainly yet to come!  Actually, there is enough of the best stuff omitted in this set to allow for a second \\"Crossroads\\" release to be the better of the two!!<br /><br />  I think that Clapton did a good job in all his participation, (at least in what is on these two DVD's), with the one exception of not giving more time to Vince Gill.  Gill is the best guitarist in country music, and I had hoped that he would have been able to really exhibit his playing skills at this guitar-oriented event.  Usually, he has to focus on his vocals, that is what made him such a huge figure in his genre, but at the expense of his playing time on stage.  His guitar-work is incredible, when he has time to display it.  I had even thought he might have played some more rock-oriented selections, just to show what he can do!<br /><br />  The single best song presented on this set is the one solo number by Robert Cray.  It really stands out among the selections on the second DVD.  ZZ Top was a good choice to end the DVD, but they butcher the lyrics, though the two songs were well chosen.  Where were Tommy Shaw, & Styx?  I heard they were awesome at this festival!  The young guys were able to reach a different audience, I think.  I was particularly impressed by Jonny Lang, who sings as well as he plays.  Vai's performance was well-planned, and Mayer was an interesting addition.  But, what was James Taylor doing there?<br /><br />  This entire festival needs to be released!!  Or, at least much more of it!ang, who sings as well as he plays.  Vai's performance was well-planned, and Mayer was an interesting addition.  But, what was James Taylor doing there? <br />    This entire festival needs to be released!!

B000059HB7|5.0|Rio Bravo is an excellent western that was the best teaming of John Wayne and director/producer Howard Hawks.  John T. Chance, along with his two deputies, Dude, a drunk gunfighter, and Stumpy, an old cripple, is the sheriff of the Texas town called Rio Bravo.  When Joe Burdette, a local lowlife, kills a man in cold blood, Chance arrests him for the murder.  Joe's brother, Nathan, is a big man in the area and will pay anything to get his brother out of jail.  Chance and his deputies must guard the jailhouse and wait for the marshal to come as Burdette and his gunmen try repeatedly to get Joe out.  At the same time, a girl arrives in town who takes a liking to Chance.  This is one of those westerns that is just a lot of fun to watch.  Hawks blends the right mix of action, comedy, a good story, and quick, witty dialogue.  The formula obviously worked for Hawks and Wayne because they basically remade this movie two more times, El Dorado and Rio Lobo.  If you're a fan of Rio Bravo, check out the other two although this is the best of the three.  Rio Bravo also gave composer Dimitri Tiomkin a chance to test his score for The Alamo, also starring the Duke, most notably his version of the \\"Deguello.\\"      John Wayne is great as Sheriff John T. Chance, the law in Rio Bravo who must try and keep a murderer in jail.  The Duke shows some of the comedic ability that doesn't come out in many of his movies.  Dean Martin plays Dude, the drunken deputy called \\"Borachon\\"(drunkard) by people in town.  Deano even gets a chance to sing a couple of songs; \\"My Rifle, My Pony, and Me\\" and \\"Cindy.\\"  Ricky Nelson is surprisingly good as Colorado Ryan, a young gunfighter trying to prove himself.  Angie Dickinson stars as Feathers, the new girl in town with a checkered past.  Walter Brennan is excellent in a supporting role as Stumpy, the old, crippled deputy who guards the jailhouse.  Rio Bravo also stars Ward Bond as Pat Wheeler, one of Chance's friends, John Russel as Nathan Burdette, Claude Akins as Joe Burdette, and Pedro Gonzales-Gonzales as Carlos.  It's too bad this movie hasn't received a Special Edition DVD release since the current release is bare-bones.  The DVD offers widescreen presentation, a theatrical trailer, and cast and crew information.  For one of the Duke's best westerns with plenty of action and comedy for everyone, check out Rio Bravo!
B0000508U6|5.0|I'm not a music critic and I'm sure there are those that have negative opinions of this CD like the moron was trying to compare this CD to Metallica and other heavy metal bands.  I don't know how to classify it, but I really really like it.  I had \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" and got this CD.  I think they're both great.  I like all kinds of music (except hard core rap) and this CD ranks up there with my favorites of the other genres. <br /> <br />I really like the way the music is layered.  This is a great CD.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|even worse than korn its slipnot more dorks with zero musical talent an amputee on guitar and a singer who whines about being grounded by his mom more radio friendly(extreme) music to appeal to little geeks withno fear stickers on thier sears warlock guitar now u better go buy this cd youngman or u wont fit in the dorks who shop the mall and debate if its blackmetal or neon death club
B00006G8G4|4.0|As a life-long Spider-Man fan, I was super skeptical about this movie when it came out...however, I was really pleased when I saw it in the theatres, and just as much so when I viewed it again on DVD.  Of course, being a Spidey collector, I had to get it on this special set.  It's a nice package, with a film cel, litho drawn by Spidey legeneds the Romitas, and other goodies.  However, I would have expected either a little more or a little better for such a gift-set obviously geared towards real fans.  That being said, I am anxiously awaiting the collector's set for Spider-Man 2.
B000669GAI|5.0|the best collection of pearl jams meaningful great music see why they were the biggest band around for several years in the 90s songs like black jeremy even flow alive are still as meaningful and cutting edge today as they were in the 90s bands like creed simply copied these guys
B0002858YS|1.0|This album and this band SUCK!!!!!!!  Hailed as the next big thing by the British press, of all people, this Las Vegas based band is as poseur-ish and a rip-off as I've ever seen.  If you're looking for a crappy band that simply rips off the sound of Interpol and Franz Ferdinand, has annoyingly-whiny vocals with terrible lyrics, and is self-conciously cultivating a glam-androgynous-faux-gay image (look at the bass player and the whole band's posturing to see what I mean), then this is your band.  That lead-off single Somebody Told Me, is garbage, as is this whole album....I re-sold it for a third of the price back to the record store I bought it at within days....STAY AWAY!
B00006IUL7|5.0|One thing that puts this a notch above other thrillers is the utterly convincing moral struggle of the Pacino character. You can really imagine that if you were in his place you might do the same things--including making the same mistakes. If you like stories where a character tells one little lie and it leads to lots of bigger lies until you no longer seem to have the option of telling the truth, this is for you.       Moreover it has spine-tingling suspense, a fascinating setting, and excellent acting.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|When i first heard \\"Take Me Out\\", I knew this was a band I had to check out.  This first album does not disappoint.  Although they draw heavily from the sound Interpol has minted so well, they are unique in every other aspect of their sound.  Some of the best track, including Take Me Out, are Jacqueline, Darts of Pleasure, Dark of the Matinee, and the hilarious (and catchy!) Michael.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Napolean Dynamite finally got off my wish list and into my DVD player and it was well worth the money spent.  It's a bit of an odd movie--quietly quirky and comical with minimal plot, so it is not for everybody.  The elevator music inspired soundtrack goes hand in hand with the idiosyncratic outlook of the film much in the same way that Napolean's oddball look and language coupled with the film's drowsy ambiance reflect the main character's weirdo dorkiness.  This film is very enjoyable and it lives up to the hype.  It features good acting, memorable quotes and tater tots!
B00003CXA4|5.0|&#34;Gandhi&#34; is superb....Attenborough's multiple Oscar winner; including the Best Picture, Best Director, Cinematography, Costume Design, Art Direction, Film Editing, Screenplay, and Best Actor. Ben Kingsley realistically performs as Mohandas K. Gandhi who was a man who made humility and truth more powerful than empires.  However, the biased portrayal of Muhammad Ali Jinnah as a Muslim leader who wanted a separate homeland only for his own political aggrandizement, is quite disappointing. Jinnah's claim that the Muslim League represented the Muslims of India was substantiated in 1946, when in the elections for the Indian constituent assembly, Muslim League won all the seats assigned to the Muslim electorate. In truth, Jinnah was a brilliant man with great intellect, iron-will, eloquence and perseverance; a man with total integrity as quoted in a contemporary Time magazine.  Regardless the iniquity done about Jinnah, this movie is worth-seeing. For those who are interested in the history of sub-continent, &#34;Gandhi&#34; and &#34;Jinnah&#34;, both are useful resources about the independence of colonial India from the British rule.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I received the DVD trilogy as a Christmas gift, and immdiately (actually that night) watched Episode IV.  I must say, I wasn't very happy with the way it turned out and I almost didn't want to watch the others, even though I did.  IV was alright considering I had the VHS Fullscreen, now i can watch what's cut out in a full screen movie.  A few of the changes were good, for example Obi-Wan's and Vader's lightsabers have been completely revamped and look better than ever, but that's about the only good change I noticed in it.  Some strange changes i noticed but I do not know if it was the TV I used or what, but when Obi-Wan first appears scaring the sand-people, the cry is completely different than the original.  The last major change i saw in IV was the scene when the Falcon escapes the Death Star.  Luke and Han are shooting the TIEs.  In one scene a TIE is flying past the Falcon.  However I noticed the gray box around it indicating that it was obviously super-imposed in the picture (if you've ever seen National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, at the end when the sleigh is in the sky the box is there, then you know what i'm talking about.)  I don't know if that was from the TV i used or if it's really there. If someone would tell me if they noticed it also, that would be helpful. <br /> <br />ESB had more changes that may have been for the worse.  The most obvious is the Emperor's hologram.  Another was Boba Fett's voice, and one other was when Luke loses his hand and falls, they took out the (ahhhh-ahhh-ahhhhhhh) noise of him yelling. <br /> <br />ROTJ was the best of the three except for the end.  It seemed like instead of making a few minor changes, they made one major one big enough to ruin the movie.  They took out Sebastian Shaw and stuck Hayden Christianson (however its spelled) in at the final scene, and it really took away from the quality of the movie.  One other that wasn't too bad was an extra celebration scene from Naboo, it didn't really take away from the movie that much. <br /> <br />In review, I feel Lucas could have done a better job with the \\"Special\\" Special Edition DVD and would highly recommend he re-do these movies for DVD again the way they were in 1997.
B000002OZY|4.0|This was my first exposure to The Who at a fairly young age, and it's one that I come back to time and time again. I do think all their albums from 65-78 are worth getting.  <br /> <br />This one isn't as polished as \\"Quadrophenia\\", not as anthemic as \\"Who's Next\\", not as raw as \\"Live at Leeds\\", but as the album that came out at the end of the 60s, it's the one that took them from small venues into the arenas and stadiums.  <br />  <br />Roger Waters would deal with similar themes a decade later on \\"The Wall\\", but both are about the breakdown of communication and childhood traumas involving war, child abuse and trauma (Tommy has sadistic relatives and distant parents..although the movie version is the dad coming back from war to find mom in bed with another man, The Wall has sadistic teachers and overbearing mothers and dad never comes home) in adulthood as well as rock star hero worship taken to ridiculous levels. Obviously there is a tie between both concepts,which I'm sure Pete LOVED...  <br />  <br />However, when Pete did it, flower power was around, people were tuning in, turning on and dropping out, and the backstory has to do with Pete withdrawing from drugs and getting into spirituality (explored further on his solo \\"Who Came First\\").  <br /> <br />As a cohesive \\"rock opera\\", it does have a concept, but it wouldn't surprise me if half of it was written before Kit Lambert had him connect it all together.  <br /> <br />The instrumentals, from \\"Overture\\" to \\"Sparks\\" to \\"Underture\\" showcase The Who's power as a band, even more so live. \\"Overture\\" is just that, going through a medley of songs to come...  <br /> <br />\\"1921\\" is when Capt. Walker comes home,   kills his wife's lover out of rage (seen in the movie), and tells young Tommy that he didn't see, hear or will ever say anything about it. But this is also the British way of doing things... keeping up appearances, boys shouldn't cry... more about suppression than anything.   <br /> <br />Amazing Journey...when Tommy (or Pete) go into their own world.  <br />Could be through music, could be drugs as it is in \\"Quadrophenia\\", could be a spiritual journey, you decide. \\"Sparks\\" is the instrumental that follows, some great Entwhistle bass playing...  <br />   <br />\\"The Hawker\\" (aka \\"Eyesight to the Blind\\") the only cover that happens to make it on here, somewhat fitting in with the story.  <br />In the movie, Eric Clapton does a great job with the song, and they use Marilyn Monroe's image there. The song is reworked Who-style, harmonies and playing.   <br />  <br />Christmas. As they say, \\"how can he be saved\\"? He doesn't know Jesus or praying, even though he starts calling to the outside world in it, but continues to be isolated even though his attention goes towards a cheap pinball machine...   <br /> <br />Cousin Kevin - the nasty cousin...chances are this one's directed at Roger, who was Pete's bully in school. The chorus and harmonies are borderline \\"horrific\\".   <br />  <br />The Acid Queen. Think 1969 here... taking a trip. Pete had a lot of disdain towards artificial \\"flower power\\" and peace and love.. Tina Turner rocks this one nicely in the movie.  <br /> <br /> Do You Think Its Alright/Fiddle About - I almost wish they had Keith Moon do this song, esp. after seeing the movie. Entwhistle does the vocal duties and does them well, but Moonie made it memorable. A truly disturbing song about molesting that in 1969 must've been shocking.   <br />  <br />Pinball Wizard - Pinball, guitar... either one. The hit song. Now he's on his way to fame and fortune... classic Townshend guitar riff... one of the all timers.  <br />  <br />There's A Doctor/Go To The Mirror/Tommy Can You Hear Me/Smash The Mirror- The doctor says Tommy is normal, but as he's obsessed with pinball, he's also obsessed with mirrors (which could also be representative of heroin users)...\\"Go To the Mirror\\" is a great song.   <br /> <br />Sensation - The spiritual? The earthly? Buying into your own hype?You decide... Miracle Cure- kind of a throwaway song...  <br />  <br />Sally Simpson - Rich girls slumming backstage? Fanboys looking to rock stars for answers? Rock stars/miracle cures buying into their own fame? Reality hits little Sally hard although she doesn't seem to learn her lesson (married to a rock musician she met in California).  <br /> <br />I'm Free/Welcome- or is he free? He opens his house to a few, but more and more come in. I'm Free is a great song, Welcome is almost filler.  <br /> <br />Tommy's Holiday Camp- Keith Moon is Uncle Ernie here. Hoping that Tommy doesn't remember much... family leech.   <br />  <br />We're Not Gonna Take It/See Me, Feel Me... the icing on the cake, the finale. He's either an egomaniac or trying to show the fans what made him find enlightenment, but it's the inevitable backlash that fans will put on the heros they worship. Tommy's Holiday Camp puts a cheesy version of his amazing journey with a hefty pricetag, T-shirts, buttons, etc... but they aren't buying this for a minute.They all grow restless until they all rally that \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\" together. Pete is right there with them smashing everything in sight, including Tommy. Tommy starts to fall back into his shell for a second with his \\"see me, feel me, touch me, heal me\\" whimper, but then he turns outward, his voice growing stronger, and starts feeling spiritual energy and love pouring from everyone, not of adulation and worship, but one of a higher power that one can't get from sex, drugs, or rock and roll. In the end, Tommy's beaten, but not broken, and a better man because of it.  <br /> <br />Amazing journey...   <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|1.0|ok someones gotta tell me something cause i have a dillema.  at first i said theres no way im buying these and alot of others said the same thing.  what i need is for someone who said no way but bought it anyway to tell me what they thought.  i find myself looking at the picture thinking why dont i have this?  then i think about it and realize he jacked the movies up so bad its ridiculous.   <br /> <br />i need a really honest opinion from someone who didnt want it and got it anyway.   <br /> <br />i also noticed that people have listed some of the changes they hate the most so ill put mine in now.  its in return of the jedi when we first see inside jabas palace.  the long snout lady with lipstick is singing a song and its a perfect fit.  he completely changed it.  changed the song and the charachters.  it really annoyed me. <br /> <br />by the way someone mentioned the ewok yub yub song.  why would you change that?  i think lucas became retarded as he got older.   <br /> <br />now im talking myself out of it so ill shut up and please someone be honest and let me know what you really thought.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|It's not just that there's no english soundtrack, or that the closed captioning is so large that it covers a third of the screen, but this movie is just plain boring. I'm a big fan of Shiro's \\"Ghost in the Shell\\", but #2 is one of the slowest movies I've seen in years. The majority of the snail paced plot deals with a depressed cop and his dog! What a disappointment. Yes, the animation is great, but it's no better than most of the new Anime movies being produced today. There's much better stuff to spend your money on. I hope I can get my money back.
B00005JMYI|2.0|A silly goofball comedy set somewhere in TV's dark ages of two decades ago, \\"Anchorman\\" is about a San Diego TV news anchor (Will Farrell) who is also a self-aggrandizing, chauvenistic simpleton with a nice voice and a good mustache.  His world is rocked by the new feminist reality when a pretty female anchor (Christina Applegate) takes up space at the once all male desk.<br /><br />Farrell's OK as the pompous Bergundy but is nowhere near his inspired and sympathetic \\"Elf\\" character.<br /><br />There are 22 deleted scenes in the nearly one hour of extras.  Highlights are Burgundy's conversation with Bill Curtis for the \\"Radio and TV Hall of Fame\\" and his disastrous ESPN job interview.<br /><br />The nearly uncensored, exceedingly crude, sophomoric but sometimes funny commentary track for this special edition is NOT for kids or the faint of heart.
B0006399FS|4.0|I am not as hardcore a fan as some of you others out there.  I have the two best of albums, joshua tree, and the last two: all that you can't leave behind, and this newest addition  to the U2 discography, How to Dismantle an Atomic Band.  I have never been to a concert but I hear they are the one of the best live stadium acts after groups like the Rolling Stones.  I have the Live at Boston DVD that featured songs from the ATYCLB album.  Bono has a presence  that is intriguing and charismatic and you can't help but get the feeling that the four band members are decent people despite all the hype that comes with being rock stars.  The first single's sound is not how the rest of the album generally is.  Only on \\"Love and Peace or Else\\" is \\"Vertigo\\"'s raw rock sound replicated.  Unlike the other reviewer I think the thundering base line is great.  There is not one song on the album that you can say \\"this is complete crap\\".  They all have their merits but  they aren't perfect.  I must admit when I first got it I scanned through the CD and was not impressed because nothing stands out as much as the songs did on the last album.  But after listening to it for a few weeks it really has grown on me and I find myself playing the songs over in my head appreciatively (a lot of times I get annoying songs in my head, like a lot of people, but this  isn't this album isn't one of those).  I think the album is essential to the collection of even the most modest U2 fan because it is so natural and beautiful in its imperfection.  I'm not particularly devout but I think this is a basic message of Christian thought.  I think this philosophy is epoused by the band as a result of their being raised as Catholics in Ireland.  If that was their purpose, they succeeded---it's a highly spiritual and personal album.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|There's more than 35 hours of content and 100 behind the scenes and making-of features in the gargantuan, overwhelming ten disc ULTIMATE MATRIX COLLECTION (Warner).<br /><br />Besides new digital transfers of the trilogy, and five new discs of extras, there are new, multiple commentary tracks by philosophers and critics.  The most interesting voice among the critics is Todd MacCarthy, from Daily Variety. It was a brilliant move on the part of Warner Home Video to include sometimes negative observations about these films and MacCarthy's comments are especially insightful.<br /><br />I loved the first film and thought it was as intellectually provocative as it was visually dazzling.  The following two films seemed to me after thoughts that disguised lack of content with over the top action that went on forever.<br /><br />However, if film production and special effects are of interest, then this set is a bargain at twice the price as it covers -- in depth -- all elements of concept and design from script to screen.  This is the most lavish DVD version of any film so far.  Will George Lucas be able to surpass this benchmark when he releases the inevitable ultimate \\"Star Wars\\" set?
B0002DB50E|4.0|Videodrome is perhaps one of David Cronenberg's most essential films. Featuring nearly all of his trademarks/obsessions: flesh, eroticism, machinery, bodily transformation, violence and of course, disgusting special effects. It's a bizarre little sci-fi thriller about a small television station president (James Woods) who picks up a pirate transmission of a show called Videodrome which portrays acts of murder and torture. He tries to trace its origins, but soon discovers that it is more than just a TV show. It has the power to induce hallucinations in its viewers and could be potentially be used as a form of mind control. He takes it upon himself to uncover the sinister plot behind this deadly television signal. <br /> <br />Not your average plotline indeed. Videodrome may indeed be one of the most bizarre films ever released by a Hollywood studio. It's a film that a majority of moviegoing audiences will have no appreciation for whatsoever, but a fringe of weirdo movie lovers (such as myself) should find much to love about it. I've seen a lot, however Videodrome still manages to give me chills. It's a genuinely creepy movie, and the weirdo special effects are something to behold. Who could forget the images of the breathing videotapes or the cassette slot opening in James Woods' stomach? <br /> <br />Videodrome is highly recommended for fans of bizarre, twisted films and especially David Cronenberg fans. Be sure to check out the new Criterion DVD with a load of extras including commentary from Cronenberg and his DP, as well as actors James Woods and Deborah Harry.

0156027321|1.0|I am an avid reader of fiction and thirst for substantial books set in exotic places. I had high hopes for Life of Pi. Unfortunately, it turned out to be one of the worst books I've ever read. I'm disappointed at myself for having finished it.  I should have stopped when I realized it was going nowhere.  Due to all the publicity the book had received, I believed it would turn around and reveal itself as something more than the borefest it really was.  As other reviewers have noted, it starts out promisingly enough but very soon descends into page after page of repetitive  background noise. My encounter with this book left me feeling cheated and angry.  I am truly mystified as to what people find alluring about this and why it is popular at all.  4/5 of the book is an account of Pi's dealing with being out at sea with a tiger.  It is so redundant that one wonders if the author simply had to fill up a quota of pages to create this so called novel out of what really should have been a short story.
0802130208|5.0|Perhaps rivaled in form, substance, and functionality only by Boethius's The Consolation of Philosophy and Heller's Catch-22, John Kennedy Toole's epic masterpiece A Confederacy of Dunces singularly stands atop the literary world, towering ominously, yet benevolently, over the strewn remnants of the offensive literary abortions that preceded it, save the aforementioned works of taste and decency. Toole's tale winds and weaves through the variegated slums and ghettoes of New Orleans from the majestic worldview of its muscularly medieval protagonist, Ignatius J. Reilly. Ignatius's Boethian philosophy underpins the majority of Toole's opus and quite easily trumps the mongoloid worldviews of the novel's brilliantly cast, yet sub-human, side characters. Certainly ahead of its (and our) time, Toole's work speaks eloquently and accurately on the degeneration of modern society and its precarious perch on the edge of the abyss of distaste and indecency. The antidote to the crises of today, as manifested in the eructative and spellbindingly brilliant stylings of our seminally transcendent raissoneur, are eminently simple and necessarily functional- theology and geometry. These two life-guides are perhaps the essence of Toole's novel, a masterfully complex and tragicomic meditation on the social and political state of the world.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|This movie has been compared to office space and rushmore.  The difference is that those movies are actually funny, while this movie is just stupid.  I have read a lot of these reviews, people saying that you need to \\"understand a certain type of humor\\" in order to \\"get\\" this movie.  What these people don't \\"get\\" is that this movie is actually a joke being played on them.  I am a big fan of subtle, sarcastic humor, and this movie contains none of that.  This was the most boring, worthless movie i have ever seen in my life.  Do not listen to the other reviews as they were probably written by a bunch of 13 year old idiots.  I saw a review where someone actually compared this movie to Seinfeld, because its \\"about nothing.\\"  The difference is that while Seinfeld was in fact about nothing, there still were things going on, and there were plenty of jokes.  In this movie, there is absolutely nothing happening, and none of the dialogue is even remotely funny.  At times I felt like I was having a staring contest with people in the movie, because they weren't even moving or talking.  Just sitting there.  If that's your idea of \\"subtle,\\" then what you need to understand is that when something is subtle, there is an underlying idea or joke.  Things aren't just automatically funny because nothing is happening.  I also enjoy how this movie is already being called a \\"cult classic\\" even though it just came out a few months ago.  Maybe its because anyone that likes this movie only likes it so they can say tell all their friends that they are very cultured, have great taste in movies, and are in love with a subtle, dry \\"cult classic\\" because thats what MTV told them this movie was.  If you want dry humor rent wet hot american summer.  do not waste your time with this trash.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Despite the multi-million dollar smear campaign that was waged against the president, he was still able to triumph over Moore, Soros, Franken, and 80% of the media, which backed Kerry. Sure Michael Moore made a lot of money off of people who pay to listen to an overweight multi-millionaire advocate socialism (if he really cared about the poor, do you think he would weigh > 200 lbs? A family of three could live for a week off of this guy's breakfast), make baseless accusations, and doctor interviews, but I don't think Michael was in this for the cash (though that doesn't hurt). He and Soros wasted all their time money and efforts on a fruitless cause -- unless of course their goal was to parody the left and show Americans how much liberals despise this country, thus garnering votes for the GOP. This is what they succeeded in doing anyway.<br /><br />Michael has mentioned that his new project is to \\"educate\\" the 51% of the electorate that is too smart -- or too stupid as he calls us -- to imbibe his feces and say \\"yum, delicious.\\"<br /><br />Here's a tip for liberals (don't know why I'm doing this): Calling people who vote against you stupid will not get them to change their opinions. Instead of saying that believing Jesus died for your sins comes from a lack of education, why not emphasis the Christian values of charity and peace?

B0002YLC24|5.0|I was so taken by Before Sunset (I had not seen Before Sunrise).  Photographed in real time in Paris (like the Shakespeare and Co. Bookstore).  Atomosphere gets A+, Conversation between these two star-crossed lovers A-, Ending perfect A+.  Full of conversational and sexual tension.  What they talk about and the life experiences they share with each other are at times tender, harsh, off the top of their head, coy, dumb, and loving.  That's is what made this motion picture an emotional experience to remember. REAL. If you get a chance you need to see this in a theater if it reappears.
0714843377|1.0|I have no knowledge of the advertising business and no interest in learning how to get ahead in that world. You wouldn't know from the book's cover that the author's experience and advice are narrowly limited to that field. As an outsider, I could not understand some of the terminology and concepts. That is in part because of the industry niche, and also because of the British vocabulary (Persil Automatic?). <br /> <br />There's certainly value in motivational books like this, to get you all fired up when you need inspiration. It's just that this one will only be helpful to those in advertising, and specifically folks who work in small ad agencies and understand that language and culture. Outside of that narrow culture, many of the recommendations would prove disastrous indeed to one's career. <br />
B000089RVX|1.0|the youth of today is too easily influenced by the mindless dribble that MTV says is cool to soak up. granted i am only 23 years old, so i can't really consider myself to be part of the older generation just yet. but when i heard a preview of Fallen before its worldwide release last year, i had already formed an opinion in my mind. and this opinion was not a good one.  <br />Evanescence is a band that attempts to channel the darkside while trying to maintain a positive image at the same time. a little ironic, don't you think? critics and even some audiences are under the impression that they are a Christian group because they have strong beliefs and are on a label that caters predominantly to Christian acts (Wind-Up Records). yet how many Christian rock groups embrace death and despair? none that i'm aware of, and i'm not even of the Christian faith. while Amy Lee does have a pretty voice, i think she's trying too hard to be something she's not- real. it bothers me endlessly that Evanescence is filed under Goth or even Metal. as far as i know, real Goths and Metalheads don't shamelessly promote Hot Topic. don't get me wrong, they are a great store with some great purchases. but sadly, Evanscence is not among those buys. no matter how many Grammys they win over the course of their career, no matter how much black clothing they wear, they are NOT a Goth/Metal band and never will be.
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|I was surprised to find, after watching 30 minutes of the movie, that I actually wanted to sit through the rest of it to see what happened.  I don't usually like drama movies (I'm usually gone before 30 minutes), and I fully expected that I would be up in my room on the PlayStation before the end of Mystic River.  Instead I watched as the murder of a young woman slowly destroys two friends, while bringing two other childhood friends together at the same time.<br /><br />When three young boys, Sean, David, and Jimmy, are out playing one day, a car comes by and a man acting like a cop takes David away.  Four days later he escapes from the basement he was held prisoner in and runs through the woods, forever scarred and with a grudge against perverts like the men who took him.  Flash forward about 20 years; Sean has become a police officer, Jimmy a store owner with a shady past, and David a father, still haunted by memories of the trauma of his youth.  When Jimmy's daughter, Kate, is murdered, Sean is called in to investigate and becomes a key part of the investigation process because of his involvement with Jimmy.<br /><br />From there, the story flies forward with heavy emotion and a great deal of suspense as Jimmy begins to go mad with rage and David exibits his own symptoms of madness.  This movie was definately sad, but not a sappy, soppy, plotless drama.  I was pulled into the story by the excelent portrail of the three men and the events of the story.  Just have the tissues handy, 'cause you might need them.

0590353403|4.0|J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone effectively portrays supernatural elements and their ability to create the adventurous plot in her mystical story of a heroic young boy. The entire novel encompasses supernatural items that enhance Harry Potter's unexpected ventures.  Supernatural is introduced in the opening of the book with Harry's unusual lightning bolt scar in his forehead.  This shows the audience that, though Harry seems like a neglected, poor child, he is different than other children.  It reveals everything unique and astonishing about him and also foreshadows the revelation of his wizardry.  Harry's scar shows his sensitivity and his connection to his lost past.  The scar is also an allusion to Odysseus's scar in Homer's poem the Odyssey.  When Harry first arrives at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he grabs the attention of Professor McGonagall by his performance at flying lessons.  Because of this incident, Harry joins the Quidditch team, on which he breaks many records and wins heroism.  Rowling incorporates a supernatural element that appeals to childlike instincts in her readers.  This form of fun and games upholds the story's lighter side.  It stresses the importance of teamwork and use of magical powers unselfishly, unlike the evil Voldemort.  When Harry looks into the Mirror of Erised, he is forced to examine himself and his desires for the first time.  This supernatural element exposes Harry's genuine character.  He wishes to see his parents alive and to capture the stone for the common good.  The mirror teaches Harry that people are shaped by their desires.  Throughout the exciting novel, Harry's life is drastically changed as he leaves his average home and enters a new world of supernatural.  He is taught much about life and relationships with the aid of supernatural elements.  Rowling's vast incorporation of the supernatural into Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone perfects the book's course and hits the target.

0802130208|5.0|This is an amazing book, alternatively hilarious and heart breaking.   <br /> <br />Ignatius is often cited as a reason not to like the novel, and I confess he's a repulsive human.  But I don't think it's the lack of hygiene, compulsive masturbation, flatulence or obesity that turn people off of Ignatius.  He stands as a question to every social convention and class distinction, every rule and law, across the board.  He objects to the idea of blacks becoming middle class, not because he wants to keep them down, but because he is horrified of the middle class.  Likewise, his anti-feminist attitudes that are a function of his peculiar notions of sexual morality.  For that matter, his sabotage and indolence on the job is a function of the fact that he does not want a job, but is forced into employment.  Ignatius irritates people because he requires you to think about some of your simplest assumptions about life and morality. <br /> <br />The comparison to Don Quixote is not a bad one, but it is far from complete.  He has elements of vejk as well, and is ultimately an original.  The dialect writing is on a par with any Southern writer, including Faulkner.  The humor is grand, and while I keep hearing that it's being developed for the screen, my stock reaction is that I'm stunned that no one has made it into one already.  Virtually every scene in it is almost designed for the screen. <br /> <br />Toole's characters are so complete and compelling, and the situations he engineers for them are so clever and amusing, it's easy to take the book less seriously than it deserves.  For a book written in the South in the 60's, it deals with a remarkable number of social issues that really didn't break through until after Toole was dead.  Gay rights, the sexual revolution, feminism, social responsibility, the anti-war movement, the social safety net, geriatrics/elder-care, it's all in there.  Some of it had started to break the surface by the time Toole killed himself, but he wasway ahead of the curve on so many things. <br /> <br />For that matter, Ignatius ultimately raises the question of whether society has an obligation or even the right to 'help' mental misfits who don't want help.  Ignatius has to be outrageous specifically because his legal and benign idiosyncrasies are interpreted from the start as being criminal and menacing. <br /> <br />
B0001AVZA8|5.0|This movie made me laugh so hard, I was like crying.  I have to admit though, Keanu Reeves disturbed me.  He didn't look too great in this movie and he was too romantic to me, almost to a point that I would be disturbed.  Anyways, Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton were hilarious!  I love the french song too, everytime it comes on I start laughing now.  Of course now, I also want a house just like Diane's-painted white and by a sandy beach. For a great laugh, watch this movie.
B00004RFCM|5.0|Now that the \\"Six and the City\\" girls are living happily ever after and we know how their stories end, going back and revisiting the complete first season reminds us of their respective starting points.  In the beginning, at a thirty-something birthday party for Miranda Hobbs (Cynthia Nixon), the birthday girl, Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall) decide that they are going to start having sex like men (i.e., without feeling), an idea that Charlotte York (Kristin Davis) rejects.  By the end of that first episode it becomes clear that each of the quartet has their respective roles, which establishes a series of key oppositional pairs.<br /><br />Miranda is the pessimist, while Charlotte is the eternal optimist.  Charlotte is interested in falling in love and having it all, while Samantha is only interested in really great sex.  The impulsive Samantha is interested in trying just about anything as soon as it pops into her mind, while the analytical Carrie has to think things through (and turn them into a newspaper column) before she can determine the proper course of action.  Carrie is willing to try and make things happen, while Miranda is just watching life pass her by.  There are more oppositional pairs to work out, but you get the idea how \\"Sex in the City\\" is always positioned to look at everything from at least two sides.  In fact, it does not seem right if we do not discover that what is happening to each of the four characters in a particular episode does not touch upon a common theme.  For example, in \\"The Drought,\\" if Carrie's relationship with Mr. Big (Chris Noth) is entering a less physical stage then it will turn out that the man Charlotte is dating is not interested in having sex, that Samantha discovers not having sex is erotic, and Miranda has not been having sex for months.<br /><br />The recurring element for \\"Sex and the City: The Complete First Season\\" is the process of elimination by which Carrie and her friends come to terms with what they want in a man.  Specific episodes help them decide that they do not want a \\"modelizer\\" or a \\"twenty-something\\" guy.  Even in the early stages of her relationship with Mr. Big, Carrie focuses more on what she does not want (e.g., not to be a \\"secret lover\\" and not to be told that he is not interested in every getting married again) than on what she does.  I want to reconceptualize the entire six season run of the show as one of those logic games where you are told things like the person who drinks coffee lives next to the blue house and you have to figure out which person lives in the green house and which person eats pancakes.<br /><br />The other interesting thing is that at the start the other three women are all more Carrie's friends than they are each other's.  Charlotte might invite Samantha over to spend the night, but their views on the world are not exactly compatible.  The constant thread from the first episode to the last is obviously Carrie's tortured relationship with Big, but while we are watching those fight the inevitability of their feelings for one another, Carrie's friends start to strengthen the ties that bind them to each other.  Still, notice how often Carrie serves as a buffer between them and how long it takes for some of these dyads to reach the point where they can exist on their own.<br /><br />The only serious flaw with these first season episodes was when Carrie had to deal with faux issues such as a fake marriage to Stanford Blatch (Willie Garson) or a pregnancy scare, but simply because those are rather standard plotlines for shows about single women.  Fortunately, even when the series takes a misstep and covers old ground in does so in a fresh way, mainly because Carrie and her friends are willing to talk about everything from fetishes to the Rabbit.  It is that boldness and audacity that made \\"Sex and the City\\" stand out right from the beginning.<br /><br />That is why the idea that HBO would forget aboutshowing theatrical films and just devote itself to producing television shows and movies has so much appeal to me.  I already watch more shows on HBO than any other network and when I list the top 10 shows on television they always have at least half of them.  Now, if only their DVD sets for these series would stop being the most expensive ones on the market.d forget about showing theatrical films and just devote itself to producing television shows and movies has so much appeal to me.

B00006RU5B|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of harder rock. I enjoyed their singles, but after hearing a sample of each of the songs, they hooked me and reeled me in. <br /> <br />This cd is absolutely great. Each song is equally phenominal and the entire cd is rock at it's finest. However, the only downside is that each song sounds exactly the same. After a while, they all start to blend into each other. It's hard to pick a favorite song because there is very little differentiation between them. However, if you are into alternative or hard rock, this is defintately the album for you!

068485743X|4.0|As long as I can remember, I have always wanted to write a novel, and for the past few years I have been at work at trying to complete a manuscript. I have taken workshops, joined writing groups, and have devoted a great deal of my free time to this pursuit. If I am being honest, I now make sure that part of each day is devoted to writing or revising and try not to schedule anything else in this block of time, so my free time is not devoted to writing, I reserve time to write that would otherwise be free time and spend my free time figuring out what I'll be doing when I write.<br /><br />When I first started looking for books to read about the writing process, Amazon would always recommend THE FIRST FIVE PAGES as a title I may be interested in purchasing. To some extent I avoided it. The author is a literary agent and I wanted to finish what I was writing first before thinking seriously about publication. Yes, I do hope to be published and yes, if I am ever published I hope to make money though I have enough friends who have been published to know the realities of the world of writing. I decided I should avoid reading anything by anyone in the business, read only classics about writing by people such as John Gardner, Brenda Uleand, or Anne Lamott, and spend my time writing. Well, I changed my lofty plans and read THE FIRST FIVE PAGES and found it very helpful.<br /><br />The book is well written and practical. Its greatest strength is helping the writer know mistakes to avoid. It also tells what will help a reader and ultimately convince a publisher believe a work should be published. Lukeman presents actual problems and ways these problems can be avoided. Much of what he has to say is common sense, yet I found that many of the things he tells a writer to avoid were on the pages of my writing, and judging from the workshops I have participated in, the pages of other writers as well. Much of what Lukeman states in his book can be found elsewhere, but he states things in such a way that the reader will take notice and apply his suggestions to writing.<br /><br />In the course of the past few years I have taking writing classes and seminars, all offered by published authors, and much of what they have said as far as advice is concerned can be found in this book which has given it a credibility in my eyes. I have also found the book helpful when I have a specific question. Lukeman's writes in a way that is both informative and easy to read. I found myself reading the entire work in a few sittings, but since that time have returned to the book to reread various portions. The chapters are concise and organized so it not only inspired me to write, but has become a reference tool as well. Now this is not to say that after reading this book I became a perfect writer, and since I have not sent a manuscript to be published, I cannot vouch that his suggestions will keep a work from being placed in the infamous rejection pile.

The chapters are concise and organized so it not only inspired me to write, but has become a reference tool as well. Now this is not to say that after reading this book I became a perfect writer, and since I have not sent a manuscript to be published, I cannot vouch that his suggestions will keep a work from being placed in the infamous rejection pile. Yet the book has helped me decide what I will include in my work and what will go in my own rejection pile.  <br />
B000001LKY|5.0|Originally released in 1975, this was the band's fifth studio lp. It was also Lemmy's last record with the group as he formed Motorhead soon there after. This superb CD reissue tags on a bonus track of the first-ever version of the tune \\"Motorhead\\", as it's ironic to hear group founder guitarist Dave Brock providing the vocals rather than Lemmy. 'Warrior...' is a true progressive / space rock (call it what you like) underground classic. I know several fans who got to see the band when they toured the states (twice, maybe) in support of this timeless piece of work. Co-founder Nik Turner's flute playing is well noticed on 'Warrior...' as he also does the vocals on the recital \\"Standing At The Edge\\" and the ever quirky \\"Dying Seas\\". World reknown science fiction author Michael Moorcock recites on a couple of tracks as well,\\"The Wizard Blew His Horn\\" and \\"Warriors\\". Let's not forget the futuristic gem, penned by violinist Simon House - \\"Spiral Galaxy 28948\\". Brock is vocalist on several others, like the trippin' \\"Opa-Loka\\", \\"Kings Of Speed\\" (great harmony vocals), \\"The Golden Void\\", \\"Assault&Battery\\" and \\"Magnu\\". If you even remotely enjoy space rock, cosmic music or psychedelia in any form, this disc is a must have. Wanted to also note that to THIS very day, both Hawkwind and Nik Turner still plays a cut or two from this record during their live shindigs. Most highly recommended.
B000646MNE|5.0|During the years this show was such a huge success we didn't get HBO but I always assumed its praises were overly pretentious. That is until my sister got the complete set for Christmas and I decided to see what all the fuss was about. I may have been a big-time skeptic but, I must confess, I haven't enjoyed a series as much as this since \\"Xena Warrior Princess\\" and they are completely different! \\"Sex and the City\\" is not only a smart and addictive drama/comedy, it's filled with great acting, witty humor, clever writing, touching moments of friendship, and situations that have to do with love, heartache and lust, which we can all relate to in one way or another (although I doubt the average person has slept with as many men as these gals have!). It's true, these girls are obsessed with fashion (especially expensive shoes) and they love drinking martini's, but they are not at all ditzy. In fact, they each have upstanding careers, are very independent, and, for the most part, are okay with being single (except for the more conservative Charlotte who is determined to get married by season three). I'm only on season four yet a lot has already happened to Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda. However, on a creative/entertainment level the episodes are showing no signs of slowing down because, just when you think they've covered every possible subject matter that primarily focuses on the highs and lows of relationships, they surprise you by reaching new ground. And to me it only seems to be getting better as the series progresses and New York City is the perfect setting for all this to be happening in. I'm just sad there were only six seasons and that the movie deal has been cancelled.<br /><br />I also think the price is a bit outrageous for the number of episodes featured on each season (season five, I know, only has eight episodes!). Overall \\"Sex and the City\\" is a wonderful show, though, and one in which will greatly be missed by many.
B00000JQFL|5.0|I was introduced to EW&F's music while I was growing up.  My dad has always been a huge fan of their music; he played their songs all the time.  This album along with 'Spirit' really made me see that EW&F can't be touched when it comes to pleasing people musically.  When I was really young I loved this album, and to this day I still love this album.  In my opinion, 'Gratitude' is the best live album that I've ever heard and believe me, I've listened to many live albums.  I also would like to add that this album includes the live versions of two of my favorite EW&F songs, 'Reasons' and 'Devotion.'  I prefer the live versions of these songs better than the studio versions.

B00005JN2Z|2.0|This movie was pretty cool, some funny lines in the cab and some wicked shootouts.  I should have come here first and read the reviews, now I'm just another casualty of the terrible ending.  This pretty cool movie all of a sudden starts marching lockstep with the formula action movie ending you've already seen a million times.  They even shoehorn in a pretty girl at the end for the hero to save and fall in love with, even though she hasn't been in the movie since a couple minutes during the opening credits.  It also irritates me how in these movies the bad guy is incredibly skilled and deadly, but when he fights the main characters his skills are suddenly gone.  Either that, or the loser cab driver suddenly acquires navy seal training.  Either way, I ain't buying it.
B0006A9FMI|3.0|I applaud Dreamworks for providing literal translations for the movie in the form of subtitles. I was pissed when i found out my Jin-Roh DVD's subtitles were designed to match perfectly with the english dubbing, which was designed to match as closely as possible the lip movements of the characters. I hate dubs -- i usually see the original version in japanese with subs, and it's fine. I get exactly what the movie producer wants me to get, even though i speak a different language. But dubs... they just seem to have a different voice, not as gruff, more cutesy, or whatnot, and the dubs being designed more to lip movement (while still attempting to be true) can quite easily ruin a good joke, or throw the kick out of a few important lines.  <br /> <br />However, trying to cut corners and save money by combining the subs and captions is just pretty daggom stupid. How hard is it to seperate the two tracks? I've seen worse covers, but i generally don't care. I'm buying it for my viewing pleasure, it's dreamworks job to try to sell it to the masses. I don't think it's really important to them anyway. I mean, comon, let's face it, how many Americans are really into deep, phylosophical 'cyberpunk' movies?  <br /> <br />I give it a 3, because the movie was fantastic (I dunno where 'flat' characters came from, or even if it's important to the film simply because of how fabulous it was).  <br /> <br />The next DVD release will probably have an English Dub (god forbid Cartoon Network does it), and it will, of course, be designed to match lip movement, so it looks pretty (else it would disturb the viewer too much), while sacraficing the kind of power the lines carry in movies such as these. For the hearing impaired, of course, the subtitles will have to match the voice-overs (grar!). so either way, the story looses its bite, depending on how bad the dub is (again, god forbid Cartoon Network gets this one).  <br /> <br />All in all, to get what you really want, you're going to haveto learn japanese, or pay a good friend to sub it for you. I doubt that anime watchers constitute a big enough minority for Dreamworks to take both sides, those wanting literal subs and those wanting flowing dubs, seriously enough to provide both on the same DVD. With a hearing impaired track too, if they want to satisfy every minority.

B0002Z1EG2|5.0|As other reviewers have noted, Shania can not be categorized into just country or just pop. She blends the two together, in a style that is uniquely her own, making some of the best music ever created. Her love songs, such as \\"From This Moment\\", \\"You're Still the One\\", and \\"Forever and For Always\\", are already classics; as are her \\"fun\\" tunes, like \\"Man, I Feel Like a Woman, \\"Whose Bed Have your Boots been Under\\", and \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\". Her new songs on this album (putting new songs on a greatest hits album is a little unconventional, also)are equally appealing. \\"Don't\\" is a haunting ballad, and perhaps her best song ever. \\"Party for Two\\" is a very catchy tune (especially the Billy Currington version) that pretty well seems to be about sex. And \\"Quitter\\" is one of the most \\"countrified\\" songs she's done.  Furthermore, it should be noted that all the songs on this album (except \\"You Win My Love\\"--another sexy little song--which was written by her husband) were written by Shania. That may explain what one reviewer noted: that \\"her eponymous debut [album]is not represented at all\\"; because she only wrote one song on that album. But 'The Woman in Me', 'Come on Over', and 'Up!' are well represented here.
B00005JMAH|1.0|As a huge Harry Potter fan, I cannot see how anyone could have enjoyed the Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban movie.  This book is the best one in the entire series and I never thought it could be ruined.  Before the release of the movie I thought to myself, how can it be bad since the book is so good?  Well, the movie positvely butchered the book.  The cast was fine, the acting was good, computer animation was great, but c'mon!  Was the movie even based on the book because I couldn't tell!  The movie was so unlike the book in countless ways!  They added a lot of unnecessary things, yet left out some very important information.  I don't know how they expect to make more movies because so much was left out of this one. People who only see the movies will be totally confused.  So, if you are a big fan of the Harry Potter books, I do not recommend seeing this movie, much less buying it.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This set is obsolete. Now you can get this same set with the second disc for each movie including the originals unedited.<br /><br />The overall look and feel of the Original Trilogy Special Edition DVDs is just like Episodes I, II and III on DVD in terms of the menu screens. The picture quality of the DVD is really superb.<br /><br />I do not like the added Jabba scene in Episode IV, which is redundant after the Greedo exchange with Han. Not too mention, the silly song at Jabba's palace with a newly added Joe Cocker looking/sounding alien in Episode VI. I have no complaints of the new special edition version of Episode V which is my favorite Star Wars movie. For example the scene in Episode V where Darth Vader talks to a holographic Emperor, the new version has the same actor playing Palpatine with his voice and image appearing to communicate with Lord Vader. The other thing that was kind of cool was the appearance of the actor (Hayden Christensen) from Episode II and III as Anakin in the final scene of Episode VI. I am sure the actor who appears originally is not happy with the spirit version of him being deleted. Plus it looks a little goofy since the man behind the mask and his voice are different only in the scene with Luke on the ramp to the shuttle where Darth Vader dies.<br /><br />Overall, the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD is worth it for the sharp picture of the movies and just the version of Empire Strikes Back alone. The bonus disc has some neat things, but after one viewing I don't watch it anymore.<br /><br />But again...you can get this version of the movies along with the originals now as a second bonus disc. Those versions are more worth the money.
140003180X|5.0|People often recommend books to me when they realize how much I read, and most recommendations are not to my taste.  But I am forever grateful to the person to recommended these books to me! I have read them all, and I waited with anticipation for each new book to come out.

B00004Y6O7|5.0|I was very young when introduced to Van Halen.  I have been a fan ever since...even through the changes at lead vocals.  I have seen them a number of times in concert, and they always put on a great show.  I have all of VH's albums, but I keep coming back to Fair Warning.  Eddie Van Halen's classic \\"brown sound\\" is most evident on this album.  Here is a run through of each track...<br /><br />-The intro riff on \\"Mean Street\\" is just pure Eddie Van Halen genius.  I have tried to play this on my guitar many times, and I just can't get it.  It just is his style and ability that put him at the top of the list of being one of the best rock guitarists ever.<br /><br />-\\"Dirty Movies\\" is a great groove...it should have been a theme song for an adult movie...<br /><br />-One of the most cookin' fast paced rock songs is \\"Sinner's Swing.\\"  I think this song inspired many teens to follow the Rock creed...sex, drugs and Rock and Roll.<br /><br />-\\"Hear About It Later\\" has a great intro with a clean EVH sound with a Flanger effect to make the riff sound a mile wide.  David Lee Roth's voice really shines out on this song.<br /><br />-\\"Unchained\\" in my opinion is one of the greatest rock songs ever recorded!  The bass and drums are locked in as a solid foundation for EVH to rip through some majorly cool guitar playing.<br /><br />-\\"Push Comes To Shove\\" really does sound like an adult movie song.  Maybe that is why Eddie Van Halen eventually did music for Michael Ninn's Sacred Sin.<br /><br />-\\"So This Is Love?\\" is just plain and simple Van Halen...reminds me of some of the stuff on the first album.  Turn it up and crack open a cold one.<br /><br />-What do I say about \\"Sunday Afternoon In the Park?\\"  This was like the one song that could get me cranked up for anything.  This instrumental was one of the EVH keyboard experiments that actually worked well.  This song seems so heavy.  The drums really remind me of Led Zeppelin's John Bonham.<br /><br />-\\"One Foot Out The Door\\" is really a punk tune.  This is one of the reasons the original Van Halen line up was so damn good.  They tried so many different things.  I can't image Sammy Hagar trying to do this song.<br /><br />If you like Van Halen, then you must own this album!e up was so damn good.  They tried so many different things.  I can't image Sammy Hagar trying to do this song.    If you like Van Halen, then you must own this album!

B0001D0FTW|3.0|Intesting release because Edguy took a few chances with this release by adding a few very pop oriented songs mainly \\"King Of Fools\\" and \\"Lavatory Love Machine\\".  The interesting thing for me at least is that these two songs are really great but the other songs which are more similar to material on their previous releases seems to be not very exciting.  At least not as good as similar style material on thier previous masterpieces \\"Vain Glory Opera\\" and \\"Theater Of Salvation\\".<br /><br />Comparing to their previous release Mandarake I like Mandrake better overall.  There are more good songs.<br /><br />I guess I am mixed on this album.  I really like the new pop songs but if I had to pick one Edguy album it would definitely be either VGO or TOS where they were more extravagant.  This is kind of a slightly stripped down Edguy and I don't think the overall effort is quite as high regarding the musicianship or the songwriting.  I am not in awe of this album like I was with previous releases.  It's cool and all but nothing special.  I can't these words are coming out of my mouth but I almost think Edguy should do the next album with songs similar to the two pop songs that seems to be where their hearts are right now and they are good at that.  Plus, mainman Tobias Sammett is such a likable little ball of energy I could actually see this band making a huge splash as a pop metal band.  They've got the energy and the spark to make it happen unlike a lot of failed past attempts by metal bands to turn pop metal and cash in.

B0002Z0EYK|4.0|I thought the movie itself was excellent, but the special features were nothing to brag about.  The behind the scenes footage was interesting, but I thought it lacked something.  There were some comments from the cast, but more from the production people.  I also thought there could have been more extras on the whole.  The greek god section was out of place, since the writers pretty much ignored the gods' involvement in the Iliad to begin with.  Overall, not that great.
B000669GAI|5.0|They call it a greatest hits album because it's all of their \\"hit\\" songs. The ones that \\"hit\\" the radio and music television and got big, becoming \\"hits\\". That'd be like Queen putting out a greatest hits cd and leaving out \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" and \\"We Are The Champions\\". I don't even know all of the songs on the record and I'm a fan of Pearl Jam. Not avid but still I enjoy listening to Ten a lot. What better cd to get than one that has all of their songs that hit the airwaves in the early to mid 90's. The ones that make us reminisce about the days in highschool and when MTV actually had videos playing on it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead was introduced to me as \\"the best band in the world\\" by my sister way back, I must have been 8 or 9, I remember that day very clearly, though the music didn't quite hit me that day.  Through the years any ride I got with a sibling there was usually Radiohead playing...and I finally rediscovered it, hitting the jackpot with 4 albums from siblings. <br /> <br />It took a while to get used to something more delicate, since a lot of what I listen to is more `in your face' like Prodigy, but once I did I was hooked. <br /> <br />1) It starts off with Airbag, a beautiful song...nothing more to say. <br />2) Paranoid Android is next (I often wonder if it's named after the character from A Hitchhikers Guide) Thom's voice is amazing, and this song is catchy, but not to catchy; nice guitar...good song. <br />3) Subterranean Homesick Alien, I love this song.  It really makes (well at least me) you feel homesick, but not in a bad way.  Guitar amazing, it reminds me a bit of surf music (one of my favorite things to do- surf!) and I dig the lyrics as well... <br />4) Exit Music for a film I never really got into, though Thom's voice is lovely other then that it didn't seem to go anywhere. <br />5) Let Down is much catchier, and as always Thom's voice is lovely. <br />6) Karma Police, one of the more famous songs, catchy, but once again not to catchy, it's just a good song. <br />7) Electioneering, I really love the guitar, it starts off great, but it doesn't get wonderful, but it is still a favorite. <br />8) Climbing up the walls, a darker song, with just as much beauty, Thom's voice is defiantly messed around with in a computer though... <br />9) No Suprises, I don't know why but this song makes me smile...maybe it's just this happy music with Thom sounding so low, and the line \\"bring down the government\\" where he sounds so sarcastic... <br />10) Lucky, such a 90's song...slower, but powerful, same darkish feel (though not as powerful) as in Climbing up the walls. <br/>11) The Tourist another slower song but still good...it's a good ending for a great album! <br /> <br />Thom's voice and lyrics are perfect.  Some might say it's whiney, but often though are the one's who listen to `bands' like Britney Spears (who will NOT last half as long as Radiohead will) who I must say has a very whiney `voice' as well.  His voice is brimming with emotion, and his lyrics are powerful, but open to interpretation, something you won't find on pop albums these days.  The music is flawless as well...keyboarding and guitar working together instead of competing. <br /> <br />I have all of Radiohead's `greatest' albums, and even though plenty will argue The Bends is their best album, I still have to say that OK Computer is a hair better.  If you like this album, Kid A and The Bends are a must as well. <br /> <br />Most certainly an album I'll force my kids to listen to in 15-20 years. <br />

For those who have experienced, and for those who have grown spiritually in life. The people who know the ones you love are more important than  than money or the latest sale at the mall, or what's cool for the latest wine parties. <br /> <br />While there is a sad sheen to most of the music, the lyrics and instruments sound uplifting and alive. This is a record with spiritual renewel and road trips in the heart and mind. <br /> <br />Melancholy does not always equal sad. Sometimes it's forward thinking yet reflective. This is a great road trip CD, especially through the mountains of the west. <br /> <br />Beck wrote some quircky songs that have not aged well. This is not one of those records.  Congratulations are in order.

B000006TRV|5.0|There are no better records in rock history. There may be some that are as good, but they are few. <br /> <br />Some people who think the record is just about \\"teen angst\\" are the same ones who only listen to Kansas, Bob Dylan or Eric Clapton. The Floyd were oh so much more than that. They were flying on all cylinders. They were colorful, uplifting, depressing, sneaky, powerful, and just plain brilliant. <br /> <br />And I had to respond to this comment by another reviewer: <br /> <br />\\"I give the rest of the band due credit for making a skeleton of great music that withstands the extreme burden of Water's ego which alone is far more than any rock enthusiast or band should stand for. Gilmour, Wright, and Mason did an excellent job, and the fact that the backing music is great (and that ALL of Water's music in his solo work [lyrics not considered] is garbage) truly shows that Gilmour was the mastermind behind Floyd's sound more than Waters ever was or ever could be; \\" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />This reviewer fails ot understand that Water wrote almost all the music for the Wall. He wrote Nobody Home (piano part and all) in one night. Wright was ousted from the band because he wasn't contributing. The truth is, while Waters was an egomaniac, the others had become lazy and had stopped really contributing to the band. This is well documented. So the problem was not just Waters, but the other band members as well. They wanted to race Ferraris instead of working on records.

B00005UW7G|4.0|This Don Giovanni is not the worst, and it's not the best. But it's about as close as one can get to the top of the list without actually being there. Ruggero Raimondi is a great baritone and too often overlooked (his signature role is Scarpia). His Don Giovanni is given both a fantastic voice, full of expression, and a fantastic actor to back it up. The \\"Donnas\\" both shine, and their performance alone is worth the price of this DVD. <br />The sound is difficult to deal with--the balance between singers, etc. <br />The filming aspects--cinematography, lighting, sets (oh, the sets!) are all very well done, and the work is as much a success as an opera as it is as a film. <br />My only beef is with Malcolm King's Masetto, which is horribly overdone (and, at least for me, the character whose lip-synching was the most obvious, as everyone else seemed to disguise it well). <br />My advice: buy it.

B0006399FS|2.0|I'm a long-time U2 fan; I've collected all of the official releases and a number of more obscure ones, and I've seen the band live eight times, going all the way back to the second show on the Joshua Tree tour in April 1987.  So, I esteem myself as a reasonably qualified critic of this latest effort, which is a mediocre rehash with a few bright moments and a few numbers that are among the worst U2 have ever recorded.      I'll start with the good stuff.  \\"Vertigo\\" may be an overdone throwaway that ages very fast, but it has guts and a catchy hook.  And unlike the rest of the songs on the album, it doesn't sound identical for its first twenty seconds.  \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" is brilliant until its lifeless and uninspired chorus practically ruins it; I cringe every time I hear the song, as it rubs my face in the seeming reality that U2 can no longer cap off great intros and verses with anything better than a chant-like, fist-pumping \\"Oh, you look so beautiful tonight.\\" \\"Miracle Drug\\" is a winner both lyrically and musically, and \\"Yahweh,\\" while a little hard to take for a longtime fan due to its showcasing of Bono's time-weakened voice, has that inspiring, uplifting quality that marks the band's best efforts.      Meanwhile, there are stinkers. Unfortunately, the fact that Bono sang \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" at his father's funeral doesn't save it from being a dull, plodding bore.  Ostensibly catchy rockers like \\"All Because of You\\" and \\"Love and Peace or Else\\" are formulaic filler.  And U2 have never unleashed a sonic turd anything like \\"Man and a Woman,\\" which is even worse than its title, and an embarrassment to all that the band have ever accomplished.      As Amazon's own review states, \\"this album was salvaged from sessions that the band had deemed to be sub-par.\\"  And while I wanted to love it, the fact is that it isn't very good.  Please, guys, make your next album fresh and alive, and not something like this, which promises much but ultimately never rises out of the mire from which it came.

I am so glad that I picked them up after all the three books had been released as I cannot imagine how I would have borne the agony of having to wait for a couple of years to find out how this delicious saga unfolds.<br /><br />Pullman combines the multiverse and dark matter theories from modern physics with theology and pure fantasy to create a gripping saga with only a few logical loose ends. The tale begins in a parallel universe quite like ours (even in the names of places and their relative geography) populated by humans who have externalised polymorphic souls called daemons. The corrupt Church has established a stifling theocracy and seeks to suppress anything that goes against what it has propagated. In particular, it wants to reign in and control the research into a recently discovered curious form of matter called Dust.<br /><br />The ebullient and charming heroine Lyra Belacqua and her daemon Pantalaimon find themselves dragged from their blissful abode in Oxford into what becomes the ultimate battle led by Lord Asriel against The Authority (God) itself. They are ably supported by the brave Will Parry from our own world and a whole lot of other characters including gypsies, witches, armoured bears, mulefas, Gallivespians, etc.<br /><br />While the story in the first book happens entirely in Lyra's world and is quite linearly narrated with Lyra always at its centre, the next two books have several threads of narration, many more prominent characters and keep switching between worlds. The story is quite gripping and the pace quite good. I did find the end a bit disappointing and strange considering the ambitious swipe of the story's plot, but I still found the book on the whole an extremely satisfying read. I was a bit sad that it had to end and I keep wishing I had an external daemon of my own too.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!nd and I keep wishing I had an external daemon of my own too.  <br /> <br />Very highly recommended!
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|In some ways, Mystic River reminds me of Clint Eastwood's Oscar winner, Unforgiven.  The characters are all in someway, shape or form, imperfect.  Jimmy, Sean and Dan are all victims of the life they lived and the consequences that followed.  Sean Penn is errie as Jimmy, definetly Oscar worthy.  Marsha Gay Harden was great as Dan's belegered wife.  But the best performance was by Tim Robbins as Dan, the man who's life was forever changed as a child.  This is an unpleasant film to watch.  But the performances are outstanding as well as the direction of Eastwood, who is continually raising the bar with every movie he's made since his Unforgiven Oscar win.<br /><br />Those who criticize this movie should stick to watching Ozzie and Harriet reruns.
B00006DEFA|3.0|I'm not the only one here who adores this film, so I'm not sure why so many people are raving about an extra 20 minutes added to a perfectly structured film. So we get some more background on minor subplots--so? It was enough for me to know that Mozart was irresponsible, that he had no students, and that Constanze resented Salieri because he refused to help Mozart get a court position. I didn't need to see this dragged-out, talky extra footage reiterating how jealous Salieri is, how childish Mozart is, and the \\"new\\" portrayal of Constanze is totally non-credible and offensive. Much of the new footage clashes with characterization at other points in the film, and all three major characters end up less likable as a result. At least they spared us more \\"background details\\" such as where he bought his shoes, etc.
B000000OA6|5.0|No words can describe this wonder of the world. One of the best albuns of all time, the best of all i own. 13 years after Freddie's death, it's hard to believe he's gone, however we still can feel his presence when we hear something like this, simply the greatest Queen album, along with A Night At The Opera. That's why they're the greatest band of all time, due to their own style, originality and feeling. The most touching of all their albuns, with some of the best lyrics ever written.
