B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I got this on New Year's Eve as the last free app of the day today in 2012 from Amazon.<br /><br />This game has gotten many 5 star ratings which I could sort of understand why those reviewers would give it such a good rating.  It looks like it is a good game to explore things in it, and you get to draw things such as your character to give yourself a unique one-of-a-kind experience.  It even has a good story to go with the gameplay.<br /><br />However, I am giving this one only 3 stars though for the reasons below.<br /><br />The game's interface system seems to be inconsistent with the game's overall draw-it-yourself theme.  It would have been much more better to actually draw the path of where you want to go using lines to go from point A to point B rather than to just move your finger to guide which direction the stick person should go in.<br /><br />Also, I had problems with the lines being drawn a little off the spot where I was touching the screen when I was drawing the people.  The calibration appears to be off in this game which is a very important part of this game experience.<br /><br />So since I can't give the game a 3.5 star rating which is what I would have liked to give this one, I am going to have to give it 3 stars instead.  I am glad Amazon picked a better app to end the year with.  Hopefully, we will see more better apps like this one in 2013 as part of their free app of the day promotions.<br /><br />UPDATE: I redrew my stick man and the lines appear to be drawing in the right spots now.  So maybe the earlier problem I had was just a small bug.  Therefore, I am going to increase the rating from 3 to 4 stars now.
B004JZBGWI|3.0|I had tried numerous shopping type programs and this was one that works okay, but not as good as others.
0805047905|4.0|Will recommend to other parents.  I like the art and am sure my little one will as well.  Seems to be able to hold up very well.<br />Very nice.
B002DMJLTE|4.0|Of all the disaster movies I've enjoyed, this is certainly one of my favourites. Wonderful story and cast. I watch it every couple of months.
0694003611|4.0|I would definitely recommend this item to other parents.  It is a nice traditional board book which I am sure my little one will enjoy.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|This was purchased a a gift for my adult daughter.  It is one of her all time favorite movies and having it in DVD format is awesome!  I only wish Disney would not limit their DVD editions so that all of their movies would be available on DVD all the time.
0399226907|4.0|I loved it and am sure my little one will too.  It is a nice strong board book.  Will recommend to friends.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|This album transports me away from the modern world.  All the musicians and instruments sound so beautiful.  I love the whole album.  It's old and new all at once.  It is a work of art and love.
0307200477|2.0|The very first time I opened it and looked through the pages, it fell apart.  The book is bound really cheaply.  I had to re-assemble it which was very annoying and now I don't even want to open it so it doesn't fall apart again.  I can see that I will end up throwing it out since when it falls apart, the spine can hurt my little one's fingers.  Very disappointed.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|What more is there to say.... one of the greatest period pieces that I have ever seen. So much attention to details. Watch it , you will NOT be disappointed.
B005IT0V8O|5.0|No question about the value of this writing standard.  Everyone interested in writing better must have a copy.  It's not as handy as a reference in Kindle form because ready access to the material is not easily attained.  A hard bound copy is preferable.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Before I hated having to re-deal the cards after each round. It was tedious. Now it auto-deals and you get to choose if it will automatically be a winning deal or just a random deal which I love. An the multiplayer, splendid! And when you're stuck there is hints! Its awesome.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I did not see this as any grand comedy . I watched the first half & laughed out loud twice . Maybe I don't get stoned enough . I almost stopped watching & realized I had paid 1.99 to see the whole thing . The Flash Gordon bits were humorous . But I spent more time thinking that something funny would happen than actually being amused . If you can borrow or rent it for a 1.09 it might be worth it . This is not a movie for children .
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I thought it was great! It is so much better then the movie!<br /><br />I loved the part when Greg watched the movie about the muddy hand.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Sony is doing a commendable thing by funding small grants to young game designers. Earlier, we enjoyed the Katamari series for its non-violent action. This is a step up. We first saw &#34;flowers&#34; at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in 2012 (History of Video Games) and was totally impressed. If you get tired of the standard game fare and are open to subtle ideas, this is a good purchase for you.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Totally awesome. The book definitely left me wanting to get the next one right away. It definitely ends with a cliff hanger!
B00498TQV8|5.0|Realistic.  Excellent screen script and actors selected.  Rural South depicted accurately.  Should be added to your personal library.  Will recommend.
B001FXCE46|5.0|I Love KOL This album is great! I Cant wait to they come out with a new album... Use somebody is the best song in the world
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Almost finished with the book.<br />Many thought provoking ideas about NDE.<br />It is very hard to put this one down!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app! Just got a kindle for Xmas and this was one of the first games I downloaded and it's great!!
B00AA0TJO8|1.0|i dont like it tried to play it but it was so bad i could not i was so mad because i got it for free bot if it was 1.00 i would get a ree found glad it free.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|We watched it for family night and my 6 and 8 year old loved it. Very enjoyable for Mom and Dad too. My girls were playing like they were Tinkerbelle and Periwinkle the next morning.
0756655307|5.0|My 11 1/2 year old grandson just loved this book.  It was his absolute favorite gift.<br />He had his nose in the book most of Christmas day - did some lego structures too<br />but really loved reading about his favorite Marvel characters.  A real WINNER!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Great read! Has some slow parts, but overall...Great! Hoping the next books are just as good and fast paced. Stick with this book...the beginning is quite dull and slow, but sets up a wild ride.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is intense and keeps you there. The unexpected twists and turns are what makes you fall in love with the characters. Excellent choice!
146500632X|5.0|This calander is by far the best out of all of them... the boys have great single and group pictures (especially zayn in January). This is a perfect gift for any hardcore directioner!!!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game is fun for children and adults. My kids and I have really enjoyed playing it. Most of the puzzles have just enough challenge to be fun and the ones that stumped me at first seem so obvious later.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I've always loved Led Zeppelin, this DVD set was great to enjoy one more show. A must for any fans collection.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is such a great app it replaced my clock. You can set alarms to be your music<br />And can change the way the clock looks.
0316228532|4.0|If you can get past the fact that this novel in no way resembles the Harry Potter series, then you can start to appreciate this book for what it is.  It's a big departure for JKR, everything that readers associate with her - complex plot, scene setting, character growth, action, finding meaning in adversity - is not in her new novel (although the latter point is debatable).  Neither is magic, the supernatural, or tidy, happy endings. It's a social commentary on modern society, about how people interact, and about the \\"authenticity\\" of the folks that make up a community. It's a study of a microcosm that represents western attitudes on a macro level. It isn't whimsical, or sugar coated (the cover art of the book leads you to believe otherwise); JK actually swears which can be jarring at first, and she talks about sex (gasp).  People do ugly things to one another, think ugly thoughts, some characters are irredeemable, all are flawed.  I had mixed feelings about this book up until the first quarter of it.  The story telling is not as strong as her previous work, but her character exploration is intriguing. In the end, I found this book compelling.  I hope that her next adult novel can combine the honest look at humans in their environments with some of the story telling finesse (stronger plot and a little more action) that she had developed while writing the Harry Potter series.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I just finished reading this book for the second time and wanted to throw my two cents in because of some of the bad reviews it got. I know in real life there would have been a thousand red flags. Travis is obsessive and jealous and having had a similar high school boyfriend I had to suspend my common sense gene for a while and just go with it.  Travis is fictional. He is also sweet and intensely loving with Abby. I think the author did a wonderful job of pulling him back before he crossed  the line into psycho territory. This is the kind of story that makes me enjoy reading fiction so much.
B0010358CG|3.0|Compared to the first Appleseed movie this sequel is a disappointment. The original one seemed pretty ahead of it's time technologically and had all the stuff you would expect in a really good anime but enhanced with state of the art CGI. This new one I think is way worse that the original even though the CGI was technically better , but maybe that's because the CGI software has improved, not neccessarily because they did something better this time around. I think that because this is supposed to be anime (japanese based) and they mixed John Woo in there (chinese), the japanese chinese mix just doesn't go well together. I am not joking about that, I am asain myself but something obviously wasn't right about this movie. The whole thing seemed disjointed emotionally and visually in this movie. They should have just kept the original people who worked on the first movie to make this second one. Even the voice actors in this really troubled me, there wasn't any real emotional conntection between Briarios and Daunan this time around, I mean japanese anime is kinda wierd already but this was just weird wierd. very disappointed, but still overall a decent movie.
0811870987|5.0|I bought this for my husband who is a wildlife photographer.  We sat and looked through it together just appreciating the photos.  Relax, and enjoy the variety of birdlife with this photo-book.
B009R9WAZ8|5.0|I think this is one of her best albums because its mix with hip hop beats to ballots, to dance hits!! She really show cases her voice in this album as well as reveal many different sides to her personality and style! I hope she will have a life long career because I'm def a big fan! I am disappointed the song Princess of China with Coldplay wasn't featured on here though!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I THOUGHT IT TO BE TO DRAWN OUT., NOTHING MUCH CHANGING THROUGH OUT THE BOOK EXCEPT SEX. BUT ALL IN ALL IT WASN'T BAD READING, JUST GOT A LITTLE TIRED OF ALL THE SEX.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Delightful to watch. Very fun music to listen to. Really enjoyed that there wasn't an overly emphasized romantic storyline. Liked how real the girls were.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I got this app because I love jigsaw puzzles. its awesome! there are tons of puzzles to choose from and a lot of them are free. difficulty is from 35 to over 200 pieces. love this app! and its free!
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|You can see the funniest parts in the trailer.  Rest of the movie is very boring and hardly funny.  Not recommended.
B0026PW67W|3.0|This map does not fold out like the one on the movie but my son was thrilled with it anyway.
1594487154|5.0|We're all in sales now... which is the first of many spot-on insights from Dan Pink in his latest book, \\"To Sell is Human\\". Pink is a master of blending business and psychology in an easy-to-read, relevant, thought-provoking and applicable manner. He writes about what matters now and what will affect our future.<br /><br />Pink tackles more than just selling, here. What makes the book stand out and carry meaning and future conversations around the water cooler and dinner table are the lessons on how to be a more thoughtful, creative, authentic communicator, presenter, and yes, human being.<br /><br />This book is for... anyone and everyone. After all, we're all in sales now.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received a copy of the book from the publisher, but the opinions expressed in this review are my own and haven't been edited or approved by anyone.
B0007939NO|5.0|This is one of my husband's favorite movies and we only had it on a VHS taped off a TV airing from years ago.  After searching for a professionally taped copy for years, I was thrilled to find it for his birthday present.
B005PZ85SO|5.0|I just started watching last year and I just can't seem to get enough of it.  I'm playing catch up now try to purchase all the previous season.  I'm up to season six.
B005FUTC86|5.0|This has long been a family favorite taking us into the land of make believe so realistically at our children wouldn't believe it wasn't real. Even now, as teenagers, they love to watch it with the family. As usual, Dick Van Dyke hit another one out of the park.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|After two previous books, the questions, &#34;I wonder what happened....?&#34; and &#34;Wouldn't it be cool if....?&#34; loomed even bigger for me in the Book Three wrap up. I was not disappointed, as these kinds of questions about the lives of our characters were answered very satisfactorily. What's more, I was left still wanting to know MORE! The cliche applies for the entire series - I couldn't not put these books down.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke teamed up for an unbeatable combination in Mary Poppins.  Still a favorite with our family after all these years.  Recently abandoned VHS technology so we purchased this DVD.  I miss the interviews that were on the VHS however.
B009KUANWG|5.0|to a 'T' !  And what a voice she has , amazing , and the perfect Bond theme song for this movie .
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Was not sure if I would like it but it is very addicting. Lots of fun and is a great way to pass time.
B004FP1WX0|2.0|Catfish was not the jaw dropping movie that I expected. The description reeled me in, but it was less than what I was hoping for.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Worth the money!  Great story and lots of fun to play.  Kept me occupied for days.<br />Would highly recommend purchasing.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Ted was a riot, Mark played a great roll and the writing for both him and the bear where great, so authentic, reminded me of when I was in my 30's with my buddies.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|a book unlike any I have ever read before. Although appauling<br /><br />I could not put down this book!  The story is crazy but you hang on every word  with your heart beating for the characters in the  story!
B00ADS98FC|4.0|This is a movie to see with the girls!  We really enjoyed it. It reminded my daughter in law of when she was in choir.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES, BUT I LIKE THE LONGER VERSION, IT FILLS IN SOME OF GAPS. LIKE WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE SCHOOL, WHY IT WAS CLOSED. I HEARD THEY ARE COMING OUT WITH A PART TWO IN THE FUTURE, CAN`T HARDLY WAIT FOR IT TO COME OUT............................
B000VX1CF8|5.0|My husband has wanted these shoes for years and he couldn't be happier with them. The fit is perfect and they look great!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I thought I was fairly well informed on what and who crashed the economy. WRONG. Inside Job was very well made and did an excellent job of following the bread crumbs to many of those who were responsible for the crash. Totally worthy of Five Stars.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|good game love hidden object games g5 offers a wide variety of wonderful games to choose from look forward to playing more of them
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Bravo.<br /><br />Wool was great. It is five books, but I shouldn't have been thinking about it that way. It's more like five sections of one book. It's an important distinction to make because at the end of the fifth book, it feels like the beginning of the story. And for the story to feel like it is at its beginning after 5 books is weird. I haven't read 6 and 7 yet, but the first 5 books create a world and put it in a set of circumstances that are quite compelling. The state that the world is left in at the end of the 5th book is fascinating. Not fascinating in a JJ Abrams-esque `you have no idea what the forces are acting on this world' type of way; but fascinating in a `you have enough only information to know that a truly epic showdown is imminent' type of way.<br /><br />I love that the author gives some indication of what is coming. I appreciate that he has plans for the world, for the characters. However, the scope of the implications of these first books make me worry that it will take north of 10000 pages for the author to bring this world to the conclusion I am aching to see.<br /><br />Many of the characters in the beginning of the book are great. Juliette is the best of them, and the reader privileged to follow someone like her through this world. The Pact and The Order are cool. I'm eager to see what's in the rest of those volumes. I can't wait to hear more from the man with the hollow voice.<br /><br />If there was one thing I wish there was more of, it would be that I wish the story was better at opening my eyes to things in real life that I didn't see before reading it. It reminds me of the Matrix, but when I first saw the Matrix, I walked out of that movie different than when I walked in. Wool is incredibly gripping, and the central message is a good one. (The central message being about legacy and choosing our path when we find ourselves in a place where fate put us.) The message is good. But I wish I'd felt it more, in a way that it would inspire me after reading. This message is conveyed with a lot of emotional power in the movie Lone Star.<br /><br />I keep comparing Wool to movies and TV shows because it feels so cinematic. It's so vivid in my mind that I feel like I watched it on a screen.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Such an am amazing book. I could not stop reading it! I stayed up all night once I started it just to finish it because I could not put it down!
B007FDE4Y8|2.0|The cost of an easy to understand set of instructions on how to balance the camera would cost the Opteka less than 10 cents (or just post it on the website).  A couple of informal YouTube videos filmed by a teenager using an iPhone and narrated by some Opteka engineers providing recommendations on how to balance the unit would be invaluable. The fact that neither of these exists seems to indicate that the act of balancing the camera is more luck than technique.  I can balance it 65% but it is still very wobbly and would not be sufficient for a video filmed while walking indoors.  I am trying to balance a Canon T2i with an 18-55mm stock lens.
B008602KQI|5.0|While the craze to develop movies from popular books continues, it's not all a ridiculous conglomeration of messed up storylines.  Some screen-writers and directors actually care about whether or not their movies reflect the integrity of the titles they're stealing.  &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; is no exception. Director Gary Ross, who was also one of the writers for the screenplay adaptation, brought author Suzanne Collins in as one of the script writers to ensure that the movie retained the essence of the popular series.  This has to be one of the best moves ever made.  Yes, there are some minor diversions and differences, but overall, the movie is the storyline almost exactly.  With brilliant casting choices - using talent rather than big names in most cases - the Hunger Games movie tells the heart-wrenching story of Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark two of the twenty-four children who are forced to play a role in the most evil invention since the holocaust: Panem's hunger games.  A sadistic pageant, the hunger games forces children to fight to the death to remind the country that it should never rise up in rebellion again.  Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson, and Liam Hemsworth are just a few of the fantastic cast that make this movie well-worth watching.  If you haven't read the book, go do so now.  Then go watch the movie.  It really is a great adaptation.  This movie is proof that filmmakers are finally beginning to take books seriously, understanding that they are popular for a reason, and deserve to be turned into quality movies.
B000W91RUG|5.0|we still can't believe how many of the re-runs we see on tv are from the first season, but they edit them on tv so you get more of the hilarious-ness you crave with the season - love it! (not the seller i got it from but the discs themselves!)
B008B68IEA|5.0|I just got Abbey Bominable's bed today and I'm actually somewhat impressed.  It looks nice for the most part, but there are some things I think would've looked better.  The pillow is pretty small, so I think a larger pillow would've been nice because the bed is actually kinda big; the pillow just doesn't look like the right size for the bed.  I also don't really like the blanket.  It's very cheap and just looks like someone just cut out a piece of cheap fabric.  The length of the blanket also doesn't cover Abbey all the way.  I have my Abbey Bominable Dead Tired doll laying in the bed, and the blanket is from her chest down to most of her feet, but her feet still hang out a bit.  The pieces you attach to on the bed aren't very durable either.  When I would put them on either they wouldn't attach all the way on or they would just fall off.  It comes with a miniature diary of hers that's EXTREMELY tiny!  This piece can very easily get lost or get swallowed by a small child or pet.  It doesn't have a place on the bed where it can be attached onto so I would recommend the diary to sit next to Abbey in the bed.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is so much fun.  Who knew slicing fruit could be this much fun.  You should check it out.
B007ADIRDM|5.0|I got this as a gift and the one I got also came with a Draculaura doll with the Clawdeen Wolf doll.  The outfits are quite adorable.  Clawdeen's hair is straight and smooth, which is something I don't often see with the Clawdeen dolls (her hair is normally wavy I think).  The furniture is pretty cool as well.  The couch is very easy to put together, though it's sometimes difficult to have two dolls sit on the couch together straight.  The Victorian chair is also difficult to have a doll sit straight in.  At first, I found the \\"bar\\" to be quite confusing to put together; and I still have difficulty with it staying together.  After I was finally able to put it together (it took about 45 minutes just to figure out how to put it together exactly), the bar/shelf part is a bit tricky too.  I can't seem to get it to stick with the back part of the bar.  There are quite a bit of small pieces to this too, so I don't really recommend it to smaller children.  This pack also comes with a little magazine for the dolls to look at.  It's really difficult to have the dolls hold the magazine and can be quite frustrating if you're wanting to pose them.  Other than that though, it's quite nice to look at :)
B00785P2QC|3.0|I also dislike that it prompts you to buy more points with real money and upload everything via Facebook. Everyone does not need to know about what I do in my downtime. Pretty cool that the game does offer different buildings though and is a little more complex than most simulator games.
B002L5KKK2|5.0|We actually rented it twice so that both my boys could see it.  My husband and I watched it both times.  Both of the boys really liked it also
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love Pinterest ... just down loaded it on my kindle .... So many ideas.  Just made chocolate chip cookies with bisquik.  Love the ideas for cereal boxes.  The list goes on.
B005CRQ4OW|3.0|I love the series, as does  my son, however the Kindle version does not make use of many of the Kindle's features. There is no highlighting , book marking etc...<br /><br />Great series though!
B000007T1M|5.0|The cd worked perfectly, and arrived on time, the sound is great and it's definitely their best cd ever. I have no complaints at all!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It is what it is. Like most siege engine based games its fun to knock stuff down. Good problem solving exercise.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|I loved all the movies in this series...can't wait to see the final one!!! Love how Bella succombs to Jacob's charm...even if it doesn't last.

B003Y5H574|5.0|This movie is hilarious.  Steve Carell is one of my favorite actors and he is super funny in this movie.  Ryan Gosling definitely does not disappoint!
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Not much you can say about a battery.  They seem to be fully charged.  They work great and have a great price on them.
0345803507|5.0|I absolutely loved this entire series.  I like how it ended on a very happy note and it was amazing to see the change in Christian.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|The only full-length concert Led Zeppelin ever did after the tragic death of John Bonham was thankfully filmed and recorded for posterity, apparently with no intent for release by the band. Thank goodness they changed their minds about this, because they put all the doubters to rest (the sane ones, at least). By releasing this to the world at large, they prove that they remain the consummate rock and roll band, absolutely untouchable. As a Led Zeppelin fan practically my whole life, I have collected literally thousands of cd's of live Led Zeppelin from all eras of the band and their projects after they broke up. That's not bragging or anything, I'm just saying I have plenty of reference! With these as a reference point, I can honestly say that Celebration Day captures the band at their very best in a long, long time. Robert Plant manages to sound better here than he had for most of the mid-to-late '70's, which is amazing given his age at the time, Jimmy Page is still the fiery virtuoso on the guitar here, John Paul Jones - looking and sounding amazing - provides the same irreplaceable bass and keyboard lines essential to the Led Zeppelin sound...and then we have Jason Bonham. Jimmy Page said in an interview that no one but Jason could've done this, and he is 100% right. Jason's drumming is absolutely brilliant here - channeling his father's power and rhythmic ingenuity into a truly powerhouse performace. Kashmir is absolutely epic here - the best live version of this song I have ever heard. In the '70's and '80 it always seemed like someone missed a cue somewhere, but not here. This performance is flawless! The sound on both the cd's and the dvd is great, although it seems to get better from 'For Your Life' onwards (both performance and sound quality). I notice a lot of people are bothered by the editing, but it's really not that bad - who wants to watch Robert playing with his microphone while Jimmy is soloing anyway? The bonus dvd of the dress rehearsal is prettystark: one camera, stationary, but still a revelation to hear the differences between then and 4 nights later. If you're a completist such as myself, you'll love it. This is a great gift to any Led Zeppelin fan - a testament that Led Zeppelin remain giants among men!
0345803493|5.0|Awesome book...after reading this first one I couldn't wait to get started on the second and it didn't disappoint me at all!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I think that this is the best one yet I really hope that. He makes another book and that it will be much better than this
0345803485|5.0|WOW!  That about sums this book up!  I couldn't put it down.  This book can definitely make you blush...couldn't wait to see what happened next!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Addictive city. Very cool under game. You don't have to wait forever to gain funds. To many vehicle repairs though. Once a day game for me.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My children absolutely adored this movie when they saw it in the movie theater.  The colors are vibrant and the songs are extremely catchy.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|When it started calming down the story started getting edge again that made you want to keep reading, it was really good
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Awesome game can't put it down but, to all the people complaining about it not working it says KINDLE FIRE TABLE EDITION! So if you  don't have a kindle fire don't complain about it not working. If you do have a kindle fire awesome game but if there was more towers like a assassin monkey that would be awesome or maybe a yeti monkey.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is very fun. It can be difficult, but not too hard. I think everone should get this app.
B001C3I4UM|5.0|Great album .Takes me back to when I was growing up.If you grew up in the 70's this will help take you back.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Me and my 6 year old love this movie. Very good storyline . Definitely a movie worth buying! A must see for children.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great graphics and a great story line and its a lot of fun!  There are hints when you get stuck and you can skip the mini games after you try for a little bit!  great game!

B003H4I4JU|5.0|It was different than enders game I wasn't really expecting to enjoy it when I started but I did. He says in the beginning that it was meant to be it  own book and if you read it like that you should enjoy it. Starting exenocide now!

1594487154|5.0|What, another book about selling?<br /><br />No, this is not \\"another\\" book about selling. I've read a lot of them, written a few of them, and I can tell you: This book stands alone in a special category.<br /><br />Why? Because Dan Pink was just an eentsy-teentsy bit uneasy about the notion of himself as a salesperson when he started researching the book. He doesn't say so directly, but you can tell, reading between the lines.<br /><br />Now, fast-forwarding to the end of the book, you can see he is TOTALLY comfortable with the identity of someone who sells. As a result of what he learned.<br /><br />That's important -- because most people are uncomfortable with sales, whether that means being a salesperson, doing the act of selling, being sold something, or, in many cases, they are fundamentally uncomfortable that the activity of \\"sales\\" exists at all, anywhere in the world.<br /><br />I know, because I sell for a living. I do it behind the keyboard of a computer, for the most part. As an advertising copywriter.<br /><br />You might wonder if I'm selling you right now. My answer is no, and maybe, since I made a decision in my career long ago never to sell something to someone for whom I don't think that something is right; and always to do my best to give a person I think a product or service is right for, EVERY opportunity to consider getting it, so they will get it.<br /><br />That's my definition of selling. Since I don't know you, I would have to break my own rules to try and sell you this book.<br /><br />But I can give you five categorial \\"if-then\\" statements to tell you what kind of people I think this book is for, and what kind of people it is not for:<br /><br />1. If you are committed to hating selling no matter what, forget about it. Don't read this book, seeing as Dan will make you hate yourself in the morning, because you won't have any reasons left to keep hating selling -- and all that hatred would have to go somewhere else, now wouldn't it?<br /><br />2. If you like the idea of selling and/or selling is part of your job, but you think you're \\"just not cut out\\" for selling, I STRONGLY recommend this book. That's because Dan proves very logically and plausibly that there simply is no such thing as a \\"natural\\" when it comes to selling. He also shows that anyone can learn to sell effectively in a style that is consistent with their values  -- a style of selling that lets them sleep well at night.<br /><br />3. If you think you know all that there is to know about selling, don't get this book. You'll be disappointed that there's \\"nothing new.\\" You have to think that, since you are predisposed to coming to that conclusion, regardless of the facts.<br /><br />4. If you love to learn for the sake of learning, you'll love this book. Because you'll find plenty of new and delightful insights that will make this book worth reading for those insights alone.<br /><br />5. If you are a top salesperson and you want to stay that way, you might as well get this book. It's all but required reading for you. Because Dan makes a distinction I haven't seen made as pragmatically anywhere else. A distinction that will help you sell more and keep you from making boneheaded mistakes that even the best of salespeople could get away with, and frequently did, as recently as a few years ago.<br /><br />The distinction I'm referring to is the effect of the Social Web on everything we say, do, see, think, feel and experience. Yes, everything.<br /><br />Specifically, the importance of all the readily available factual information about products and services online, as well as customer opinions (this one, for example; and those on: Yelp; Facebook; blogs; and the list goes on).<br /><br />To his credit, Dan also provides information in the book about how to prosper in the new Social environment.<br /><br />I was particularly pleased to see that Dan even ventured into the exotic realm of selling that is my specialty: advertising copywriting. Hetells a charming if somewhat disturbing story about advertising legend Rosser Reeves, many decades ago. Reeves and a friend were sitting in a New York City park, when Reeves saw a blind man with a tin cup.<br /><br />The man had a cardboard sign next to himself with the words \\"I AM BLIND\\" written on the sign.<br /><br />Reeves made a bet with his friend -- that by adding just four words to the sign, he could greatly increase the amount and frequency of donations the blind man received.<br /><br />His friend was skeptical, so he accepted the bet. Reeves then went up to the blind man and asked permission to make the change on his cardboard sign. The man agreed.<br /><br />Reeves added the four words \\"It is springtime and\\"<br /><br />\\"Almost immediately,\\" Dan writes, \\"a few people dropped coins into the man's cup. Other people soon stopped, talked to the man, and plucked dollar bills from their wallets. Before long, the cup was running over with cash, and the once sad-looking blind man, feeling his bounty, beamed.\\"<br /><br />His sign now said: \\"It is springtime and I AM BLIND.\\"<br /><br />Mention of springtime made passers-by unconsciously (and immediately) compare THEIR situation to the THE BLIND MAN'S. They realized how fortunate they were, and how helpless he was. Empathy kicked in; and purse strings were loosened.<br /><br />The instant and heart-wrenching comparison people made in their minds came from the contrast Reeves (with his trademark diabolical brilliance) set up with those four words: \\"It is springtime and\\"<br /><br />Thus, the principle of contrast is vividly demonstrated. Contrast turns out to be one of the most important elements of a sales argument ever discovered.<br /><br />The book is chock-full of other examples that not only give you immediately usable techniques, but also create lots of \\"aha's\\" that you can use to strengthen your sales repertoire.<br /><br />As you can see, I'm a big fan.<br /><br />But before I wrap up, a mandatory disclosure...<br /><br />I know Dan Pink. He is a friend of mine. He has written about me in Fast Company Magazine and in one of his earlier books. We once had coffee at Starbucks on Chestnut Street in San Francisco.<br /><br />We also both have the dubious life advantage of having nuclear physicists for fathers.<br /><br />So if you were looking for an objective review, you'll have to read another one. Of course I'm biased in his favor.<br /><br />Dan did not compensate me to write this review, although I did receive an advance copy of the book, at my request.<br /><br />And while I am biased, please understand this: I also have a professional reputation in the areas of selling, marketing, strategy, and entertainment.<br /><br />So while I would not go out of my way to slam this book if I didn't like it, I would also not risk damaging my reputation by recommending any resource on Amazon unless I fully believed in it myself and thought it would be of use, and of interest, to others.<br /><br />The good thing about this book is it comes with a guarantee.  If you don't like it, Amazon will take it back less shipping costs and give you a refund.<br /><br />I hope I have given you enough information to help you make a good decision.tells a charming if somewhat disturbing story about advertising legend Rosser Reeves, many decades ago.

B0062KMDZ2|5.0|Finally they put this out after how long? About time ... Now all we need is the Percy Jackson release !?
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Haven't seen the film yet, but had to get the Highlights on MP3. Great collection, but how do you fail to include \\"A LITTLE FALL OF RAIN\\"? I know... wait for the \\"complete version\\" to be released. Their marketing ploy is brilliant. I got this as a gift so I'm not complaining. And $5 is a great deal nonetheless.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great!! Took you to another place. Would highly recommend it.<br />Couldn't get enough. So glad there are two more books.
B004UO0SAO|5.0|Very impressive. Haven't used it much, but it looks like this virtual calculator does everything the HPs do. I worked at HP when the first RPN calculator, the HP-35, came out. The RPN concept revolutionized calculators. I was very happy to find this app for my new 7 inch Fire. I would just like to have a &#34;help&#34; function, as I'm not familiar with some of the features!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I absolutely Loved it.  Definitely one of those love stories that hold your attention until the last page.  Mira Lyn Kelly is most definitely an author that I will read again.
1600247245|3.0|Worst reader ever. I am on the road a lot and was disappointed becaue I really could not enjoy a book by a writer I love. It was bad. That man was no Harry Bosch.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A great story, I would definitely recommend it. I simply could not put it down until I finished it. Definitely worth the $10.99.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Okay, I'm pretty hard on apps.  But it's only because there are sooooo many terrible ones out there; copycats, blatantly stupid, unimaginative, permissions up the wazoo, you name it.  Bottom line most apps out there just plain ol' suck.  And I'm pleased to say, Draw A Stickman is NOT one of those apps!<br /><br />Now THIS is a truly original app; one that all others should sit up and take notice of.  The game play is simple, straightforward, very well done, and most of all -- FUN!  The controls are genius in their simplicity; anyone from 3 - 103 could play this and it would hold their interest.  And best of all -- it's completely unique to each player, because WE get to draw the main character, and his friend, and then watch our creations be part of the game!<br /><br />Stickman's friend is actually gobbled into the game and you have to rescue him.  How cool is that?  Touch the screen, and your stickman walks there.  Touch a fuse with the fire pencil, and it lights, then blows up the dynamite to clear your path. Cool! Irreverent! Simple! Addictive! ...Oh, and did I mention Fun & Original?  The soundtrack doesn't annoy me over time, like so many other terrible ones do in other apps.<br /><br />It plays well both on my phone (LG Marquee) and my tablet (Toshiba Thrive.) No glitches, hiccups or crashes.  Yes, I've seen other apps that have tried a similar concept of game play based on user drawn input, but they never rose to this level. Not even close.  Most apps out there should be scrapped at the idea stage; they simply aren't worth the time and effort that goes into making them, let alone merit a consumer's time or money. In general, there's a big ho-hum factor in the caliber of Amazon's free App Of The Day offerings.  Sure, there might be a good one, here and there, but generally, they've been complete duds.<br /><br />When all this started, there was actually some great stuff being offered.  But then, it seemed like all the good apps dried up and its mostly been crap.  But that doesn't fall on Amazon alone - most of the apps out there are crap, and that includes Google Play.  Draw A Stickman Epic reminds me of what a good app should look like -- simple to play, well programmed, universal and worthwhile from inception to customer. Oh, and the permissions are almost non-existent, which is exactly how it should be.  Whenever a crap game wants too many permissions, I immediately suspect malware, or perhaps just delusions of grandeur.<br /><br />Stickman Epic is a great game, and good way to cap off a year of mediocrity with these daily freebies.  Good job.  Go for it!  You'll have fun with it! ...We now return to our regular scheduled programming....ap.

B008ELUEQC|5.0|The person I purchased this for loves it.  I have listened to it and I love it also.  I am now a Rod Stewart fan.
1419705849|5.0|My kids love this book series. I order two for Christmas gifts, and the were excited to get them. This book was a excellent buy.
B000FC11JW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, and basically will plan to re-read it once about every six months. The advice is both practical and theoretical. It pairs practical advice such as the importance of measuring the time you spend on tasks, with much more insightful discoveries such as the fact that there will never be enough time to do everything and how important it is to work on the right things. This book is not didactic in practices, so it will pair well with Steven Covey's 7 habits approach, or David Allen's approach in Get Things Done.
B0083DJWGO|3.0|The Good.<br /><br />The book has interesting and novel proposals. You will find practical rules and keen observations that will help you understand complexity. You will enjoy some of the passages. Mr Taleb comes from both his practical experience and his desire to theorize and this is very valuable. His autobiographical and personal episodes are fun to read. He is refreshingly anti-establisment.  He has a very witty style that you might enjoy.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />The substance could have been written in a 20-page essay. Most concepts are left without serious analysis or sometimes just half-explained. How life thrives on criticality (the frontier between order and chaos) and complex order, what he names anti-fragility are much better explained by other authors on complexity.  His dissertations will -many times- distract you from understanding the basic concepts.<br /><br />The Ugly<br /><br />His ego gets in the way most of the time. His anger does not help. He is not so much interested in being truthful as in trying to prove he is right and worthy. You may find him extremely opinionated and self-centered.<br /><br />More at depth, he is just trying to make peace with himself, so the anger and the insults are just a mirror and yes, surprisingly, a the very end, he thanks his readers.<br /><br />Level of Consciousness<br /><br />If you are familiar with David R. Hawkins' Map of Consciousness, this book's average is at 301 or  Willingness; below Acceptance and Rationality.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Lots if variety,  nice graphics, not too easy -which is a plus-but not so very difficult that you want to quit  the mini ganes are good
B0053O89KG|5.0|I bought the fourth season of Castle for my father-in-law and he absolutely loved it! He's been watching it non-stop since Christmas. Fast shipping, spot-on price, and arrived in excellent condition.
B00AE2LJVS|3.0|The movie had a good and interesting story, but they made it too graphic and emphasized the violence too much.
B000FVE3BG|5.0|I bought this watch for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely loved it! He's right handed but the lefty is still a great fit and he claims it is more comfortable for his wrist. Great price, fast shipping, and pristine condition. I could not be more pleased!
B0039HR5QS|5.0|Very well done. RR at his best. Suspence and an exellent plot make this one of the classic movies of all time.
B00AFEYUVG|4.0|Since I read the book I wanted to see how the movie turned out. Got interested in the book since I read a review of this which said it is a very popular YA book and since it was short - an afternoon read - it became a nice break this weekend. Would Harold Bloom ever look at this? I am afraid not. Is it really for YA? In some respects, if it is, it is frightening. So much more \\"drama\\" must be going on in young people's lives. Frankly, it would be a rough description of early years at college. In some ways it is similar to Tom Wolfe's \\"I am Charlotte Simons\\" - though no one reads that in an afternoon. This is now a movie soon and will probably be more worth an afternoon. But for some YA this may be a very important book even though the movie does not look like it has done well. I hope not for too many, but for those it addresses they need it pretty badly.
1451695187|5.0|It  was a fascinating read for everyone.  Particularly those that have an interest and fascination with the possibility of an existence  after life on earth. The fact that this was experienced by a neurosurgeon only made  me more interested in reading his viewpoint. I read it in 2 days. It was hard to put it down.
1451688091|4.0|Excellent research and writing-a bit long but otherwise a great read! I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in Lincoln and history.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The first and second books are great. I like the adventure in them. I can't wait to read the next book.
B00797MB0O|1.0|I decided to watch this movie because the DVD box said it's  a comedy.  It was far from being even close to comedy. It was something depressing, dark, boring, cold and stupid. I couldn't make myself to finish watching it. DVD went right into the garbage. Unfortunately, I lost an hour and I can't get it back. This movie is about a woman who could have a great future, but she decided not to. Instead of making the right choices, she preferred to drink, and live absolutely empty, selfish life. There is nothing funny about it. It's depressing and scary. I was wondering if the screenwriter was high, when he was writing  this \\"comedy\\".
B00785P2QC|2.0|It is an ok kind of weird gme and I don't know whar else o say so I am ending this message..
B002PYW26Y|4.0|Awesome flick from my younger years, I kinda expected it to suck when I went back and watched it (a la Phantom Menace).  However, despite some of the cheesy effects and some of the campy dialogue, I actually still enjoy it quite a bit.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks! I have read all his books and this one lived up to the rest! I couldn't put it down.  I can't wait to see the movie!
B004KZOWEG|4.0|The book opens up a portion of history largely unknown and untaught, at least in the United States.  Certainly aids in understanding Africa and its peoples better.  The book is a bit too long with portions of material being redundant.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I've been wanting this game for a long time and since today is the day it is free for my device I am so happy! Played it on my friends ipod and it was very fun! love it!!!!!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Unexpected, romantic, a story of hope :-) couldn't put it down!  I have read her other books and am officially a Collene Hoover fan!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After finishing the first book, I was ready to burn it.<br />I...I could relate, so much. And it stung; I hated Christian Grey. But \\"50 shades darker\\" is surprisingly, satisfyingly not darker at all. Quite the opposite. I fell in love with Christian. And quite a lot was revealed.<br />Anyway, like I told all my friends, this is pretty much twilight minus the vamps and with sex in every chapter. I love it. And although it's not very intellectually written, the love story kept me reading. 5 stars, cause I'm a sucker for clichés.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|So if you are on the fence about buying a Green Day CD, you are talking to the right guy !  Awesome stuff, we have purchased all three CDs, UNO, DOs and TRE.  Which one is best, what song is your favorite?  Does it really matter? These are new quality recordings from an everlasting musical group. They are fun to listen to songs.  Will the lyrics change the world ?, probably not but for sheer enjoyment which may make your day a little better, listen to these talented guys and enjoy.  Thanks for selling them Amazon !  Respectfully submitted, Skip Wieland
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Very easy to adjust times across preferred days of the week. Also,  the fact that it allows me to choose the specific tune to wake up to is excellent. The choice of how the alarm could ring allows me to either wake up gradually or, in the case of my less favorite, jump out of my bed heart pounding.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There are many books that are rated five star that in my mind don't deserve the praise. This book does.  This book is living out loud - hard subject dealt with very sensitively. This writer has a gift to show how life is an emotional soup - good, funny, filled with love.  The plot reveals itself beautifully and isn't obvious but when fully revealed has a beautiful shape. It's art. Thanks for a memorable read.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|John Corey meets his demise while &#34;jumping the shark&#34; in this book. No, he may not truly die, but I don't know because I stopped reading after the first quarter of it. I have read every John Corey book and most of Nelson DeMille's books up to now and could not complete this one. DeMille's wise-cracks were funny in the past, but this was tiresome. The book was bogged down by the constant wise-ass comments. Definitely a case of &#34;too much of a good thing&#34;. If DeMille could trim this and future books down he will be great again.

B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Not what you really expect, but with a wrapped sense of humor this movie is very good. If you can not take a joke don't watch it, if you ever had a Bear that you liked it is worth watchibng
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is the BEST game I ever added to my Kindle Fire.  Wish there were more Flow Free games.  The colors are vibrant and the game is very addictive.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This movie is extremely well made. I could watch it many times. I love this show! I hope there is a sequel!
B004XDYJRU|4.0|TuneIn Radio is by far the best radio streaming service out there! It contains all of my local stations, and it is a convenient hub to discover new artists, and radio stations alike. Overall fantastic application!
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|Such a shocking but well written book! I couldn't put it down.The ending surprised me very much. Loved this book.
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|A really good game but you only get the first few levels and you will have to get the whole game for money but really good!

B000NY12LO|5.0|This is a great read, but it is a little intense because it deals with suicide.  Jodi Picoult makes you want to keep reading.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I love this game.<br />its addictive but fun. I wish it was completely free but its not expensive I guees
0316056863|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  You can hear Tina Fey's voice when you read it.  I was laughing out loud a ton! Great read!
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I'm not a big fan of Kirsten Stewart's very stiff acting, but it looks like this really was a great role for her. (Very little speaking on her part!) Anyhow, two thumbs up!
0812550706|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He isn't much of a reader, but he has really enjoyed reading this book.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B000I3PA8Q|4.0|Great option from Amazon to download. I had never seen it and was told it was great. wanted to see it but wasn't something I'd watch often enough to buy. Great movie, a little different than most Star Treks.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I found this book to be a great read.  I could hardly put this book down. I became immersed in Charlie's world.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|They tried to be too offensive Enough so that it would ruin the focus of the movie. It was funny though in a few parts. Definitely laughed pretty hard once or twice but overall I wouldn't recommend.
0007229674|5.0|Bought this for my chef boyfriend as one of his Christmas presents, he loves it! We had our Christmas a couple days ago and he hasn't put it down since.
B005LAJ212|5.0|Love the show, love the DVD, comes with additional clips and behind the scenes. Best show in years - definitely worth buying if you like the show or are a fan of psychological thrillers.

B008ACC9CM|5.0|These two create heavenly music together!  You just have to hear it yourself!  They reach into your very soul, evoke emotions you may not have realized you had, and make your eyes misty!  And unbelievably she is only 16 and he is only 17!!!  Even Simon Cowell loves them !!!  (They won &#34;Britain's Got Talent&#34;)
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|While it's not my normal pick I really enjoyed it. The story line was easy to follow and an enjoyable escape for the day. I was pleasantly surprised
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover has quickly become one of my favorite authors. Slammed and POR were great but this is simply amazing! I was not expecting the ending and really loved the final decision of the heroine.<br /><br />There is a 17+ warning on this one for a reason!!!! There are serious adult themes in this one.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|i enjoy playing this game more than other matching games like it. it has a backstory which gives the game purpose.you're not just playing for high scores.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|While writing this review, I am balling my eyes out. This book was the best book I have ever read.. and I have read a lot of books. Even though this book was incredibly sad, it has changed my life and made me realize how lucky I am to be alive. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love playing this app. I watch P and F all the time one of my favorite Tv shows. this app whenever I play it there are no glithes and I never have to force shut it. This app rocks!!!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I give this book 5stars because I really enjoyed it with all my heart this is a really good book you should write more like this
B000N2HCM4|4.0|This book improved my understanding of the history of racial interactions in the United States as well as Barack Obama's perception of that history. He crosses the racial lines and gives impressions from both sides.  It also shows how an individual seeks and remodels his identity by integrating interpretations of his life experiences. It would be an interesting read even if the author were not the president of the United States.  That fact does add some curiosity as to how life events shaped the man who would come to leadership.
1419705849|5.0|My daughter has read all of the &#34;Wimpy Kid&#34; series so far and she loved the latest installment. Great buy!
B009HELT3C|3.0|Good movie for amusement. Always little surprises. Love Will &I Tommy Lee. Josh was a believable young K... that is if any of it could be believed.
B00009YOQW|5.0|This is a great drum, definitely a quality toy. Love that it doesn't have any batteries and even the noise they can make while drumming, is not irritating. This has become my go to gift for little one's under a year old. This is my favorite Plan Toy that we own by far. My daughter is two and has been playing with if for a year.
B008UFUOH6|2.0|Can't really recommend this cd to anyone.  I listened to it once and doubt I will give it a second chance.
B008FBMLRQ|5.0|What more is there to say - Duran Duran is the best group ever and definitely an awesome live band - they actually perform their music live which is a rarity in today's music.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Green's book speaks to the real issues involved when a loved one has cancer.  Do you live each day as a blessing?  Do you get angry at the basic unfairness of the illness? Do you hold back your feelings to spare your loved ones pain?  How do you relate to others who can't know the reality you live with every day? Green wraps these weighty issues into an adolescent tale of true love, and while the love story is fairly predictable, the book itself takes on questions for which there are no easy answers.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|The movie is awesome. It really makes you stop and think about war.Very realistic in every way. Its like you are there on that u boat
B00742GBDM|5.0|Awesome movie! Great acting and extremely engaging. If you love Pride and Prejudice, Emma and other period pieces, you will love it.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I chose this game as the first download for my new Kindle. It's a classic puzzle game. I recommend it for the whole family.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This movie is inappropriate for children under 17. It contains strong pervasive language, crude humour and some illegal drug use throughout the movie. In other words... Viewer discretion is advised.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is a great one! It also is a little different than the actually card game. It takes a little getting used to, but is fun to play!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you like English history, you'll love this.  History, romance, drama.... it's all here.  The acting is very good; can't wait for Season 3
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This is different than the actual card game. It takes a little getting used to. But, it's a good one.
0670026603|5.0|My heart was not prepared for those kind of feels... *sigh*<br /><br />'The thing about being catapulted into a whole new life - or at least shoved up so hard against someone else's life that you might as well have your face pressed against their window - is that it forces you to rethink your idea of who you are. Or how you might seem to other people.'<br /><br />Louisa's life is lackluster and she's completely content with 'playing it safe' at life. Not that she's ever allowed herself to contemplate how different things could possibly be. She goes to her job at the tea shop, she goes home to her windowless room at her parents house, and she occasionally spends time with her boyfriend Patrick who is far more concerned with his exercise regiment than he is with her. But when she loses her job at the tea shop she accepts a temporary 6 month position as a caregiver to a quadriplegic, Will Traynor.<br /><br />Louisa and Will are complete opposites and the first few weeks of them knowing each other the quite truly hated each other. Will was oftentimes irrationally difficult and Louisa was ready to quit, but she stuck it out and slowly they developed an extremely touching friendship.<br /><br />All I can say is that you make me...you make me into someone I couldn't even imagine. You make me happy, even when you're awful.I would rather be with you- even the you that you seem to think is diminished- than with anyone else in the world.'<br /><br />Their blossoming romance was one of the most convincing I've read in a long time and was truly uplifting. They changed each other in massive ways in such a short period of time. Louisa gave Will happiness that he hadn't experienced for a very long time and Will gave Louisa the determination to do something with her life and not let it go to waste.<br /><br />Calling this book chick-lit isn't doing this book any sort of justice; the subject matter is simply far too thought-provoking for that kind of label. The real meat of the story focuses on Will's decision to end his life by assisted suicide, which is the reason behind Louisa's 'temporary' position as he promised his parents he would give them another 6 months but no more. Convinced that he just needs something to live for, his parents hire Louisa who is bright, fun and talkative in hopes that she can convince him that he still has something to live for.<br /><br />&quot;You only get one life. It's actually your duty to live it as fully as possible.&quot;<br /><br />It was certainly a tough subject matter to read but was so well written and managed to actually make me laugh out loud at several parts. I loved Louisa and Will's wittiness and constant banter, it was the perfect addition to this poignant story. It was hard not to picture what it would be like if you were put into a situation such as Louisa and Will's. What you would do, if you would actually do anything different. All I know is that they both had an incredibly difficult decision to make and either way was bound to lead to heartache.<br /><br />This was an incredible story that was so painful (in that crazy heart hurting kind of way) to read but I simply could not put it down. Me Before You is a heartbreaking story about finding what makes life worth living and making the decision whether it's truly enough. Definitely a new favorite and one that my heart won't be forgetting any time soon.focuses on Will's decision to end his life by assisted suicide, which is the reason behind Louisa's 'temporary' position as he promised his parents he would give them another 6 months but no more.

B000001ELF|5.0|This is a great CD! I used to listen to this record growing up. I guess I was reminiscing and decided to listen to it again. This is the best one out of all the four KISS solo records!
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|good message good acting steve correl in a not comedy roll was more than passable i need five more woods in order to submit
030758836X|2.0|This very popular book missed me by a mile. I disliked the phony diary technique. I also found myself disinterested in a protagonist who seemed a true sociopath/psychopath. We all know what those people do and how sticky they can be; the variations are much less interesting in fiction than in some biographical works.
B00472NZDQ|4.0|Liked the fact that Bosch and Haller are both featured in this book. They don't jostle for space. Craftily plotted (as usual), the happenings in and out of court force the reader to hurtle towards the climax.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love the 6 sharks to play as, especially the great white and megalodon. I thought the great white could eat anything but the megalodon can. even jellyfish mines and boats.
1878424319|5.0|I love this book and had to buy another copy since I lost mine.  I appreciate that Don Miguel Ruiz explains the Toltec wisdom in simple ways that can really make a difference.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I would recommend this book for anyone. It was a great story about life And I hope this book makes you feel as infinite as I did.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was not always an easy read but a five star rating is something that I give when I emotionally connect with the characters.  I loved all of the characters.

B009369Z8A|4.0|I didn't buy the BluRay but rented it from Redbox and assume there are no differences.  No comments or summaries regarding plot, acting and the like as they can be found most everywhere else, so I will only focus on the quality of the BluRay transfer and disc itself.<br /><br />The video transfer is really quite good with largely a warm color grading for most scenes.  The film has strong and deep blacks but retains details in the shadows while maintaining a softer focus in many areas of backgrounds and the foreground when the foreground is not where the camera wants to focus. I saw no artifacts or stair stepping in any of the scenes, especially of the wooded scenes where one might expect to see such things in the high grass or leafs.  Over all, this blu ray is really very good.<br /><br />The audio is DTS HD 5.1 and the films sports a wonderful soundtrack.  I may even buy the soundtrack on iTunes as Nick Cave did a fine job with it. The audio, both music and dialogue sounded open and transparent; that's what uncompressed audio can accomplish.  The majority of the audio is spread very nicely across the front soundstage with very good directionality from both the front left and right speakers with proper and appropriate panning between them.  While there is not a whole lot of discreet channeling to the rears, the rear sound stage is comfortably used for the panning of cars and a lower volume soundtrack and ambience.  Your LFE channel is put to task for the several explosions that go deep but, IMHO, could have gone deeper but I am nit picking on this point.<br /><br />The extras are an abbreviated music video of one of the tracks song by Willie Nelson and some very interesting extras regarding the history of Harlan County and the family the film is based upon.<br />One of my long time pet peeves with any BluRay or Standard Def DVDs is the inclusion of old or future previews as they take up space which could be used to lower the compression ratios of the films and forces the buyer to pay for advertising.  Lawless, unfortunately has a few movie previews included and I hate that.<br /><br />Never the less, this was a very enjoyable movie and the quality of the blu ray will have me go out and purchase it for the collection.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thankss the buyer to pay for advertising.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was amazing. It's intensity and perspective was amplified by the fact that it was written in letter format. It makes you feel like you are in the story, but not in the lives of any of the characters. So I really hope you read this and enjoy it. I really do.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Every song is amazing and there are two bonus tracks that are cover songs. I have listened to this cd nonstop since Christmas!

B009CPJHY4|4.0|Very good movie, kind of a sleeper... Never heard to much about it on TV. Unfortunate that these movies don't get enough press.... Watch it, you will enjoy!
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|..when I say I enjoyed the film, but felt more gags could have been thrown in.<br /><br />I think with Family Guy the medium of animation allows it to have a constant stream of gags some of which are funny, some not, well, in Ted, the need to develop and sustain a story arc means that some scenes were over long and the gag count wasnt a high as might be expected. As ever, and I seem to do this a lot, those reviewers who moan about the film being \\"crass\\", \\"gross\\" \\"crude\\" etc, read the bloody box before you watch it, because you get exactly what you expect in the Seth McFarlane vehicle, please, please, please, if you dont want to hear rude words watch something more suitable to your sensibilities like \\"The Sound of Music\\", I mean its like saying \\"I bought 'Inglourious Basterds'only to be shocked and offended that the title was spelt incorrectly and contained a profanity that surely the Lord Jesus would not have approved of\\". I believe the phrase the young folk would use to describe this dichotomy is \\"facepalm\\" which probably and more accurately should be two hyphenated words, but who am I to quibble.<br /><br />Please, understand this, Ted is rude and not a childrens film. If you can get past these 2 potential deal breakers, then you should be at a suitable start point to watch the film, sure and safe in the knowledge that you are not going to be surprised. If you have failed the grasp or understand these important paradigms, please replace the dvd back on the shelf and back away slowly, If it has been delivered to your home, place it in a bucket of sand and carefully move it to the bottom of the garden whilst reciting the Lords prayer. Then call 911 and ask a nice fireman to remove it for you.

B0052RDHTM|3.0|I chose this book because i like some histry facts but this book was too much war for me, it would get enteresting and then go to far into war. it got boring

B00AE2LJVS|3.0|Good movie, but very violent.  We found the dialog hard to hear and understand.  The background music was plenty loud, of course.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best books of 2012... Powerful story ... The power of forgiveness and love ... Makes you feel good about life ...
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I bought this CD a few days ago and haven't been able to stop listening to it since. All of the actors have amazing voices and the emotion they were able to portray in the songs is breathtaking.<br /><br />They did choose to cut out part of the song Look Down, which could be a dissapointment to some listeners. I believe they also cut out part of At the End of the Day. Those were the only two songs I noticed that had things cut out of them, but I've only seen the musical once so I could have missed something.<br /><br />I would echo those who are dissapointed that all of the songs were not on this album. There are five or six songs that I am dying to own now and can't! I must say that if they were only able to choose 20 songs to be on this CD, I would have preferred that they left The Final Battle and Drink With Me off and replaced them with Do You Hear the People Sing? and A Little Fall of Rain. However, it would have been impossible to please everyone with a highlights album like this and I knew that all the songs would not be on the album when I bought it.<br /><br />Because the only things I dislike about this album are the things that are NOT on it, not the things that are, I'm going to give it a 5 rating. Here's to hoping they release the full length album soon so I can buy those missing songs!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I have been a long time fan of Stephen King, but over the past decade I have begun to tire of his books, but 11-22-63 was a great surprise. Enjoyable read which kept my interest right through to end. Memorable characters that became fast friends. I loved the fact that the book was not a turrent of curse words, which a few of his recent books seemed to be. Recommend this book to Stephen King fans and even to those who may not think they are Stephen King fans.
B009PU2SX8|5.0|A blend of genres performed by a master of music who knows how to draw  the listener in through his lyrics and tones....Well worth the money and time to listen.... and listen.... and listen some more!

B008MWBY6W|5.0|the bag that came with my DSLR is huge, so I've been looking for something a bit more inconspicuous. This is perfect - just enough room for the camera and a little extra room to put keys/license/credit card if I need to. Much better for portability. It appears to be well made and well padded.

B001OGNJYI|5.0|I have never had to send back, any of the significant DVD/CD purchases because of a defective (or wrong item).  Packing has always been superior  I really enjoy using Amazon as my personal home shopping network.  Also, a great buy for the<br />advertised price.  Really a bargain.<br /><br />John S.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I was a fan of the original series and not in favor of remastering, but this changed my mind. The people doing the work stayed true to the spirit of the original, but offerred tiny changes that would have been done back in the day if they were possible. Even the most hardcore fan with appreciate these episodes.
B009D0LBRO|3.0|When first trying to get it to work on a nabi you can't get past the start screen. Until you accidentally have a thumb on the screen too. If you keep one finger or thumb on the screen at all times then use your other hand to play the game it works just fine.
B001CD6FKI|4.0|It was an excellent copy and I was very happy with it. Not a box office smash, but excellent cast and a lot of fond memories.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Pleasantly refreshing and a quick read. I hope one day to be proprietor of The Night Circus. I could also go for a chocolate mouse with a licorice tail.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|grisham has lost his ability to cause tension in the reader. this book is a good example of his loss of talent.
B009HELT3C|5.0|My favorite in the series. No dull moments! Fast paced, and actually had a decent story line. Not an Award winner, but entertaining and worth the cheap rental of $2.99.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I cannot ever get tired of this app! The goals are the best part! If you like an app that will keep you entertained for hours, you will love jetpack.
B00136JQMI|5.0|Already had this on CD, not as portable as mp3! I've loved Miles for miles; great music for getting things done around the house or just chilling!

B000V86OKG|5.0|Gave to son for his birthday and he was very happy to receive it since we do not get it on cable.
B0088WFZQG|3.0|I thought the dialogue parts were a bit cheesy. But the action parts, the parts were acts if valor were portrayed were fantastic!
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Son wanted this for chirstmas and was very happy to receive it. He loves the dexter series and we do not get it on cable
B001GCUNW6|5.0|This is just another great movie in this series. What fun, the story is cute, the kids love it. As always the animation is excellent and looks fabulous on our 65&#34; Panasonic in Blu Ray. I definitely would recommend this movie to a friend even if they don't have kids.
1451673442|5.0|I like the method Rhonda chooses to take toward using the Magic.  The activities are fun, and I gave my daughter and son each a book with a &#34;Magic Rock&#34; for Christmas.  It should be a hit!
B007EDCWHA|5.0|This book has given us an insight on the boys` life and how hectic and crazy it was. It also shows how much their lives have changed. I honestly don't think their friends their much more now brothers. They have a lot more to look forward to and I can't wait to see. Good luck in their future boys.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|This is just plain AWESOME!!!! I have have seen the live play many times on stage and took a chance with this. I figured it would be okay at best. Most of the times when &#34;live&#34; plays are filmed the SUCK and I hate them!! The camera does not do a good job of recording live plays.<br /><br />However, with this DVD they did a great job of planning out how to record a live play to actually enjoy on a TV. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The fact that they recorded it at Royal Albert Hall makes for a fantastic BlueRay to own! Highly recommended.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app. It is an amazing app. Super fun i luv it.  DO NOT GET TEMPLE RUN BRAVE OR STREAKER RUN THEY ARE TERRIBLE. GET TEMPLE RUN THE ORIGINAL.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not bad, but not an incredible finale for the series. I'd be confused writing an ending to.this too tho so
B009VB97EY|3.0|Great for an evening of no thinking and relaxing.  Plot was a bit disjointed (no pun intended) of course the purpose didn't involve plot!
B00AA0TJO8|1.0|the game wont download no matter how many times I try to reinstall it. I tried turning off my Kindle fire and reinstall but it just wont download. no one should by this game!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is my kids favorite game, hands down.  They say that this version is the best version they've played.  It can provide hours of nonviolent entertainment that allows kids to be creative and build various structures.  While we monitor screen time, they prefer to use almost all of their screen time to play Minecraft.  We recommend this game.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|very good story but it is hard to understand , so my family agree to watch  all  bat man movies .I think every body like its,<br />Oh Batman
B0084AYLK8|4.0|A brilliant piece of work. The genius use of foreshadowing definitely keeps the reader wanting more. It is definitely a greAt novel.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Great workout.  Get to chose your starting level and you can increase your level as you get stronger.  20 min. a day is not much at all but gives you a great workout.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|always prefer books to movies. great way to introduce a young teen to reading for pleasure by reading the series
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a simple to play extremely addictive and fun time sink.  It's a game the whole family can enjoy be it young or old, You use a slingshot to fling birds into all kinds of obstacles.  This free game has provided many hours of enjoyment.  I highly recommend it to any age group.
B003O86FMW|4.0|like the plot twists. teenage daughter enjoying reading the series and so did I. not a classic but enjoyable reading
1400031567|2.0|This book wore me out. Kurt Wallendar is a Swedish detective,very defective.This crime solver carries more guilt than the people he relentlessly,endlessly pursues. He is guilty for his failed marriage. He is guilty for his neglect of his grown daughter, he feels guilty for neglecting his unapproving father.He feels guilty about not calling his fiance Baiba. He also feels sad, he feels scared, he feels sick if he has to pick up a firearm.Mostly he feels tired, but never too tired for another meeting with his numerous co-workers, who he feels guilty about mistreating. A perfect detective?? He cannot keep track of his pen and notebook. He looses his keys. He neglects his car. He fails to keep his laundry schedule. But somehow after 400 pages of this he is able to outwit and we assume capture the mastermind serial killer that he has been trying to unmask, the last 20 pages are so jammed up with some kind of solution and justification that I was unable to decipher what this mess was written for.No message, No moral, No Nothing.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I love the Cut the Rope games and this new game about pudding is just as good! Septic does a great job of blending creative and colorful art/ characters with the love of problem solving! I will be playing Septic games for as long as they make them! :)
B0000TG9E2|5.0|Great Movie. Good price. Good shipping. This is a timeless classic and has been enjoyed by all of my family! Thank you!

B00APUQT7I|5.0|Very cute movie for children of all ages! People of all ages will enjoy this movie and now I need one more word to finish this rating opf this movie.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|The movie was fun to watch, however, the previous movies were better. Nothing against Jeremy Renner but I believe Matt Damen was a better fit.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Great casual game. It was long so sometimes I forgot what was going on when I stopped.  Worth the money.
B00AE6SS5O|3.0|if u like hidden object only games this is for u. nice graphics but some of the objects were impossible to find without using a hint because they were behind the tool bar at the top of the screen or blocked by the list of items you're searching for. it was a looooong drawn out corney story. by chapter 15 I couldn't wait for it to be over. but there were 5 more goofey chapters. I'm glad it was only .99 otherwise I would have been angry. this should be a free game for kids 12 &amp; under.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Wasting way to much time on this game. I've got the hang of it but finally had to buy some hints for one board. Try it and keep your mind fresh.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|At first I thought it was too easy. But watch out! It gets more complicated and challenging. Holds my attention and there is something satisfying about the little watery pop sounds it makes.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|it so easy but it so fun to play I hope make more game . I will tell my friend to get this game
0596805888|4.0|This book is a great read, however it does not have a lot of recipes.  All of the recipes that I have tried however are fantastic.  The mac and cheese is killer and I will never make it a different way.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a must have app. I use it frequently, daily. Keeps track of charge times and usage by apps.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does everything you could ask for. I don`t need to do complicated math problems but this gets the job done for me with no problems at all. Certainly a great deal!
B005NFJAZS|5.0|We are musical theater fans and of course this has to be in the dvd collection. It is a cute movie and love hearing the great songs in it.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Good book<br />Read it in less than a day.  Twist and turns with plenty of surprises.  Ending needed a little help, but we'll worth the read.
B00AH8U3UC|5.0|Californication season 5 as hot as ever, i've bought this season because of meagan good. However, the season did well all together, it funny romantic and crazy as always if like the fist and the forth season you won't regret the fifth one as well. I love it.
B002DOSBMK|4.0|It gets a bit sappy and melodramatic at times, but makes up for it in action and intrigue. Recommend for fans of the game.
B007SGM084|5.0|As I stated above I will be happy to pass the word around re: this book, can;t wait for the movie to come out
0547884591|5.0|Love the book and Tim's 4 Hour Body has made a huge impact on my life.<br />I really appreciate that it also revolves around his core concept of finding the least amount of input for the most effect. I am actually going to begin implementing his learning techniques in my teaching.

B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Based on the excellent novel of the same title by Don Winslow, Savages provides a gritty perspective on the Mexican Drug Cartels through the eyes of the idealistic botanist ( Ben), his war vet take no prisoners buddy (Chon) and their mutual love interest (Mo).  This trio is appealing in their dilemma but Benicio Del Toro, as Lado, steals the show as the cartel enforcer.  John Travolta is great as a corrupt DEA agent playing both sides.<br />Great action flick with some heart.  Read the book for a more complete experience.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|I did not think I would like this movie as much as I did. It is a total guilty pleasure.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Case Cover by Marware, Black<br />IT MET THE NEED FOR A COVER FOR THE KINDLE.

B0055SWM08|4.0|A lot of fun. Would recommend for anyone who likes mind puzzles. Only problem I had was figuring out how to get a hint.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|this movie exceeded my expectations, good actors, good effects and, of course the story is excellent.<br /><br />you will not be disappointed
B009RI4FRU|5.0|we all want to be loved... to find the one we truly love and who truly loves us back.  well, what if you find each other when you are twelve?  what would you do?  obviously you would do anything and everything to preserve it and make it last forever.  and this is exactly what happens... with so many crazy twists and turns... until finally everyone comes to embrace the power of their love and help make this crazy story work.  it's a fun trip... enjoy
B001AW156U|1.0|When I got them I was really happy, and I played with them for about an hour. After playing I noticed cracks on them. Yes, Already. Less than a day. Really not happy with these.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Excellent movie dealing with a too real dilemma for many in long-term relationships or marriages. Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep performed their roles with all the sincerity of a real couple facing this challenging stage of life. I would recommend this movie, especially if you find yourself having trouble in your relationship.  It just might help you a little.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I gave this game a five; it's cool, fun and a little challenging.  My Mom sees me playing the game and wants me to download it to her tablet.  It's fun for all ages.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app has great information and is easy to use. Only negative - sometimes gets hung up and won't download different cities - but a good weather app to have!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book! It was an easy read and I could not put the book down. Loved the characters and the plot.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game rocks! Cool storyline, great artwork, fun puzzles. My hubby and I both loved it, well worth the price! Keep em coming Alawar!
B00846REIS|5.0|I was a huge fan of Fifty Shades and when I came across this book k was a little skeptical that it would be a knock off. Boy was I wrong! I couldn't stop reading once I started. The way it was written was easier for me to follow and feeling like I was in the middle of the story. It's definitely a must read for Fifty Shades fans!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book. Can't wait to read the next one. Couldn't put the book done.<br />Finished in no time.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|Well, for starters it is just a dictionary so of course I didn´t read the book like it was a kind of novel or anything. I do have one little concern IT DIDNT HAVE ANY MODERN WORDS!!!!!!!!<br />The bitches who wrote this book if they want it to sell with middle school kids and teachers, they HAVE to have modern technology words too.
B000069HZP|4.0|The Game is by far one of the single best psycological thrillers ever made movie wise.  Of course it is from the director of Seven, the movie is a slow pace here and there but you have to watch the whole movie to fully understand the big picture.  I personally love suspense trillers and try to guess the plotline as the movie progresses along the timeline of the movie.  When I first saw this movie I never expected the outcome that occured in the movie but it is one of few movies I can watch from start to finish and keep my intrest all the way threw to the end.  So if you enjoy some good suspense triller movies, and trying to guess the outcome of the movie as the movie goes along then this is the movie for you to enjoy and watch on a day off from work or with some pals.
1592537251|4.0|Nice book for the examples of urban sketching.<br />Far too much faint, small text on grey backgrounds.<br />Cant read it without as magnifying glass.<br />I would not buy this book again.<br /><br />I have to revise my original rating from 2 stars to 4 stars. THis is a very good book. I can tell now that I will refer to it often. I do have to wear my reading glasses due to the design issues in my original review. However, I have had more time with the book. I like the details on the tools used and the diversity of the styles. It is very well constructed. i have bent it, folded pages over and it is maintaining it's shape. No pages falling out.
B00008V2WD|4.0|Basic Instinct is a great triller that will keep you guessing until the ending.  There was a lot of sugesstive scenes and nudity but it added to the plotline of the movie and help build up the movie for the thrills.  A long time ago when I first watch this movie I didn't know how much of a twist the movie contained until I watched it all the way threw and not the edited for tv version.  I didn't really know who the killer was and to this day still keeps me guessing and I enjoy those style of movies so very much, and if you have yet to watch this movie pick it up and watch it least once during your lifetime because it's still a great suspense triller and will keep you guessing about the killer.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Got the free version and played it up to where you have to pay to continue.  I've easily enjoyed it $3 worth already so I sprung for the full version.  Stuck on one clue so far and I'm hoping it will become clear.  It has a nice spooky story,good puzzles and not too much boring hidden object stuff.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this novel.  In the midst of a school tragedy, a mystery develops.  I also enjoy the interesting interaction between the main characters.
0547884591|5.0|Before I ordered the book for myself, my thoughtful husband bought it for me. For two weeks before Christmas, I kept catching him sneaking in a few pages! It's quite different in format than Ferriss' previous books, with tons of great pics (catch a pigeon or butcher a deer for dinner, anyone?) I'm a great cook, no need for another cookbook, but I want to 'meta-learn' other skills, and Tim Ferriss is just the guy to teach me. Besides, who wouldn't want to stir up an ice cream/nitrogen concoction in 30 seconds? Just wish he had included how to catch a squirrel now that we know how to cook it; we could eat like kings during a zombie apocalypse!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Great book, and very well written. If you are a fan of books like Enders Game, you will love it
B003O86FMW|4.0|Not as spellbinding as The Hunger Games,  However, it leads to the next book in the trilogy which, taken altogether, are very good.
B009CPEOC4|5.0|This is a fun movie to watch.  Saw it in the movies and my daughter really wanted it to watch at home.  She is a huge KP fan @ 12 yrs old.  Mom likes her too.
1594487154|5.0|I'm a big Dan Pink fan, and have found his work useful in my role as a CIO and for all IT Leaders. Surprisingly, success in the technology field is increasingly fueld by a focus on non-technical elements of the work.<br /><br />I'm able to share this review on day one of the book launch because I received a copy of the book from the publisher. But the opinions expressed in this review are my own and haven't been edited or approved by anyone.<br /><br />\\"We're all in sales now.\\" You've probably heard that before. It's a sentiment that recognizes that we all need to be able to push our ideas, insights, and concerns forward. No matter your role, we all need to be influential to be effective.<br /><br />In his latest book, To Sell Is Human, Dan Pink has articulated the case very clearly, both in a big picture economic sense, and in a day to day practical sense. Pink explains that most of us spend a lot of time in a \\"non-sales selling\\" role. Not pushing product in the traditional sense, but trying to cajole someone to part with something valuable (time, attention, support) in order to further our interests.<br /><br />In the book, he's provided some necessary guidance on how we need to operate and what we need to do to be good salespeople. After making a case to setup the concept, the book is broken into two parts. Part 1 covers \\"How to Be\\" and is broken out into chapters on \\"Attunement,\\" \\"Bouyancy,\\" and \\"Clarity.\\" These focus on ideas like perspective-taking, resiliency, and communication. Part 2 - \\"What to Do\\" - covers \\"Pitch,\\" \\"Improvise,\\" and \\"Serve.\\" These provide tips on how to pitch an idea, co-create solutions, and servant leadership, all compelling ways to move someone to yes.<br /><br />Pink uses scientific research to support his ideas and insights, and also provides a series of small exercises after each chapter that you can do to immediately put the ideas into action. I think CIOs and IT Leaders will find this book super helpful to their efforts to cajole, convince, and inspire others to take action, an increasingly important aspect of getting things done in the technology space.<br /><br />CIO IT Leader Interview with Dan Pink: Dan was kind enough to let me interview him on this book specifically from the CIO IT Leader perspective. The interview will launch on my blog [...] later this week. You can also find it right now on YouTube: [...]on, an increasingly important aspect of getting things done in the technology space.

B009MCRHH6|1.0|This is awful! One of the many free terrible apps offered. I'm about to stop checking for free apps because most of them are worthless!
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I though it would be a different type camera. still figuring it out. make sure you check it out before you buy.
B003K16P3M|3.0|This book has a really slow start it does tend to get better towards the end. The book is not well written and is extremely confusing in the beginning. Cashore could have improved this book in many ways and and many questions go unanswered.

B009O2XY12|5.0|This is a fun game for my grandchildren and was easy to download for an old lady...Thanks for making it easy
0143106651|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a lady. The cover is quite intriguing, features lots of embossing, and the pages are miscut intentionally to assist in page turning.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What can I say that has not been said. It's a great read. Once you start you don't want to stop! You can't help but love Sky. She is a great character. I say give it a try and you won't be disappointed. 2 Thumbs up!
B008Y67LEK|1.0|I could not relate to this book at all, and it was recommended by a good, albeit much younger, friend.  So I wanted to enjoy it.  Luckily I &#34;left&#34; it to read &#34;Wading Home.&#34;  See my review.  Perhaps it w//h/been like Wally Lamb's book about the compulsive overeater, which really &#34;got there&#34; at the end, but I haven't the patience.

B002NK2L0M|2.0|too long, boring at times, hard to follow. zzzz. Ilike Matt Damon and all of the actors, I appreciated the history lesson, but a bit of a snoozer.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I don't know how I ever lived without this.  I love that it syncs with my phone and Kindle Fire.  I recommnd this to everyone.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I like to play this game on all levels and designs.  The purchase was worth the price.  I play it constantly.
B007RTAR64|5.0|This is perfect for what I wanted it for. This was a Christmas gift for a very big fan and she loved it!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|For being a freebie, there isn't really anything to complain about. Apparently the paid version gives more sound options and gets rid of the little banner ads.  But otherwise nice alarm!

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I liked these books because of the action. I like this book! Good for teens and young adults. Read it.
B00932A2MC|4.0|Throughout this entire movie I was wondering &#34;How in the heck are these folks going to tie into the board game?&#34; Of course it was an ocean battle with multiple ships so that was a given, but what about the essence? When I found out I just chuckled and went back to the action. Very good movie.
0761169253|5.0|My brother recommend and I really enjoyed reading this unique book.<br />After reading this book I would recommend to all.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|This movie was exactly what I was in the mood for and it is a good addition to the franchise.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was an enjoyable story.  Not a Sparks fan, but I saw the preview for the movie and thought I would give it a try.  It was a very quick read, and I look forward to the movie!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This was a great book because  it kept me interested  the whole  time. It is not like the movie barely at all, but it keeps u wondering what's going to happen next.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read this book in two days; had to force myself to put it down and come up for a breather.  Great twist!
B004LWZWGK|4.0|The video was excellent and let's not forget about that audio my home theater system rock like it needed a work-out, totally AWESOME, you hear me.
B005LAII1C|5.0|I absolutely loved this flick from start to finish. Seth Macfarlane does a great job in his directorial feature film debut.
B008518MOW|4.0|This one was the best ever!!! I'm ready for MIB 4, wander what the plot might be ? I have watched this movie 4 times.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|This movie has been a great choice. I think too many movies do away with the idea of Santa (the spirit of giving) too early in a childs life and this is the opposite. My son is 5 and it held our attention the entire time. Very bright and colorful with some very funny parts. We will enjoy this for years to come
B0049CVUNG|1.0|I had no idea that this seller was in Germany.  While the delivery was prompt we were very surprised to see the cover in German.  When my grandson tried to view it on Christmas Day he could not; check region was displayed.  It then cost over $6.00 to return it.
B00AH69AX0|5.0|Justice is one of metalica's best albums. I wish their new albums were anywhere near as good as this one.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|It combines the peace of an aquarium with the challenge of an addictive game. The faster you okay the more you can buy for your aquariums.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Moderately simple themed puzzle game. Very reminiscent of the first MYST game, this one seems to be aimed at the pre-teen crowd. The puzzles here are a bit simple for experienced gamer, which matches the slightly simplistic writing, but overall I enjoyed it. Just enough challenge to be interesting without being so hard that you're always bogging down. If you are looking for a diversion rather than a full-blown stumper of a puzzle game, this fits the bill nicely.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have never read a Stephen King book, but n ow I am hooked. This is not the typical sci-fi, horror or fantasy novel that I expected from this author. He truly is a great story teller, with quite an edge of reality. We chose this book as our workplace lunch book club, and although reluctant, I went along with the group I have thoroughly enjoyed this book and look forward to more! Highly recommend this book as a great read!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is fun, and worth a try. If you like solitaire, you will like this game. Just what it seems to be.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|A friend highly recommended the movie, so I thought to read the book first. Had a very hard time getting through the first thrid of the book, but then it seemed to move a bit faster. Some parts were actually easy to understand and follow, and enjoyable. But other parts unbelievable and difficult to understand. When the book sections skipped time, or between stories, it was difficult to follow the reasoning as to how each time era was interconnected. I kept reading to the end, and it did abruptly end without completing the story.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|This is a good game. My kids like it better than I do, but none the less fun to play.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow, Colleen Hoover is just an incredibly talented writer.  I read this a few days ago and I'm STILL thinking about it- while I found some things expected, there were definitely some twists that I did NOT see coming.  I don't have much to add other than Holder is a beautifully strong male and Sky is just the perfect heroine for this amazing story.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is the normal version, but very fun to play. Kids love it, and it is also addictive if you play too much.
0765326353|5.0|anyone who likes robert jordan and his writing style will like this author, the stories are fast paced without all the added scenery about the environment which he hates.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This is a neat version of Angry Birds. Ilove the backgrounds and different challenges. Give it a try--you'll find it hard to put down.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I kept wanting more. Sky and Holder there's a pull to them . You feel like you are there beside them the whole way.
B00A757EFW|3.0|This game takes you back to childhood. It is great fun, but a little repetative after a while. Worth trying.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was so hooked on this book. It was great! I can't wait til I get to read Mockingjay .
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|+ Very responsive to quick typing<br />+ Easy to use<br />+ Great for on-the-go use<br />+ Very good for a free app<br />+ Great for school and work alike
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There were so many good quotes of inspiration in this book. I think anyone could appreciate sky & holder's relationship as a couple but mostly as friends. There were points in the book where I thought he was to good to be true, men don't normally understand that well :) but as the story unfolded it became more apparent why their connection was so intense.<br />Major kudos to author!
B009GEEMLY|3.0|Parts were very slow. Effects were excellent. Volume could have been regulated better, dialog was low action was extremely load, good for the theater but required turning up and down at home.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The book was great and kept me interested during the whole book. It was one I didn't want to put down
B009TZBEKW|4.0|Calvin Harris is obviously a monument of house and dance music, so for $5 it is definitely a must in your music library!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It was an amazing read. The writer painted such a vivid picture with his words . You could imagine the tiger in all his glory. He knew his animals. I could hardly wait to get back to reading every time I had to put it down
1439170916|5.0|A good book written to keep my interest up from begining to end.<br />I have cancer and I was interested in how my cancer fit into the picture.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Excellent.  Could not put it down.  Looking forward to reading the next two books in the trilogy.  This is a book that I was very hesitant to read  but glad I did because it is very good with a story behind it.
1423140605|5.0|I got this for my brother for christmas and it arrived perfect time, perfect condition, perfect price, easy to wrap, etc. He loves this series and I was happy to get it for him! No complaints
B001NHNG64|4.0|Reading Die Trying was like riding a roller coaster. Strong characters and unforeseen plot twists kept me enthralled. I couldn't put it down.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Sylvester Stallone and his cast of adventurous friends make this a fun movie. Its great to see all those action heroes in the same film. Recommend watching if you into things blowing up and hand to hand combat :0)
B009CPEOC4|4.0|I enjoy some of Katy Perry's music, but mainly watched this because my daughter wanted to. It was very interesting and entertaining. I found myself liking Katy, the person even more than Katy, the musician. If you are even a marginal Katy Perry fan I think you would enjoy this movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I read the description of this novel I just thought it would turn out to be just fluff like most other books these days. Very wrong. Everything tied together really well it was really brilliantly written one of my favorite modern novels I read because it just only realistic as things are not always perfectly mended at the end but it was a shockingly unexpected novel.  The description doesn't even remotely share the novels true heart.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|I guess I thought this book might involve Canada and Canadians, and it sort of does in the last part, but the main characters are US citizens and the book spends its first large part in Montana and the Dakotas. It was hard for me to stay connected with these people, so it ended up being one of those books I finished only because it had been given to me as a 'wonderful story' and I kept hoping to find one in there.
B000W93CHC|5.0|When I began reading this book I had hopes but did not think it could be as good as pillars of the earth but to my surprise it was. My only complaint is that it's over, I hope you will enjoy it as much as I have.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Absolutely beautiful. The music is ...wonderful. The words meaningful. i wasn't sure if i would like it but I did
0760703329|4.0|The product was great - but found out after the fact that I could have purchased for a lesser amount locally.
B009JBZH54|5.0|great series you wont feel as if you wasted your money and the extras are awsome as well. great buy
B0028T6XXY|4.0|Took longer than I wanted to arrive.  Product in good shape when it arrived.  I am spoiled and normally anticipate products arriving in days - not weeks.
1400049628|5.0|This book explains some of the basics of zombie survival along with some concepts that are not really thought of. It goes in depth and it keeps you entertained.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have this on my Kindle Fire and my android powered phone. I love it. It's accurate and I use it on a daily basis
B000BBOUD6|1.0|Legends of the Fall (Deluxe Edition)Inner clip broken.DVD all scratched,some parts untrackable.Collecter box all corners damaged.Better packageing would have taken care of this.As for the factory case,what a piece of junk.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|Love this product. my only complaint is that my Kindle has to be connected to wifi to use some of the applications with in. On my android phone, I do not. Overall I would recommend trying it out!
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|enjoyable, well acted, based on fact; worthwhile rental. Interesting story about bootlegging and moonshining for the Bondurant family. Would recommend
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book- it kept me on the edge of my seat!!! I can't wait for the next book to come out!
B005VPRETE|5.0|My 6 year old granddaughter loves this series.  Wants more.  It is just the right size for her.  Came in a timely fashion.  Worth the money.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This book certainly keeps you on your seat.you think you know what is going to happen but then a turn off events changes the ending. At first I didn't think I was going to like it then I couldn't put it down
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|THis book was awesome. Right up my ally and it was terrific. Thanks for selling it to me!!!! bye guys
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put the book down and when I did I couldn't wait to have time to start reading it again. It's crazy how the story goes along. But it's definitely not a disappointment. I recommend this book. And can't wait to see the movie. Erin is in an abusive relationship with Kevin. Katie moves to Southport to start over. Who would have ever thought they were the same person.
B009NCM248|5.0|I had gotten out of the heavy music stage for a while. I heard 1 song on this album and I knew I had to buy it. good job Stone Sour
B008JGSM6G|5.0|my daughter downloaded it to my phone liked it so much i downloaded it to my kindle fire hd 7
B000FBFN1U|2.0|too many characters and the stories are too disjointed.  You become totally disinterested in the characters because he drags the stories so much
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I LOVE ANGRY BIRDS !!!  IT'S FUN TO PLAY AND VERY CHALLENGING.  I WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES TO PLAY THESE GAMES.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I like this book.  The characters were interesting. The story line was good.  It's too bad the rest of his books went downhill from here.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|One of the first scenes of the movie are of Wahlberg and Ted getting high on the couch. How appropriate since I felt like I needed to be high to watch this show. It had the mentality of a childrens show with cursing. Adam Sandler would be proud that his movies are smarter(and that's not saying much).
B000FCKGPC|2.0|I thought the author tried to introduce too many characters, and they were all uninteresting.  He killed off all his main characters so had to replace them with totally bland ones that I could not care less about.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|love Christina she has awesome  voice  enjoy listening to this in my ipod . I couldn't wait to get it i preordered it got it soon as it came out .
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|The Avengers was much more entertaining than I had anticipated. Iron Man 1 was excellent, but I was disappointed with the remaining movies leading up to Avengers. However it all comes together in this movie. The characters and plot do not fee forced. If you are a fan of the comic book genre then I highly recommend Avengers. If your not, or only a little, then you may wan to pass.
B003FMTZOM|5.0|love  Christina great cd  she has such a awesome voice . Enjoy the cd alot  listen to it alot it's in my ipod
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed this book....it started off a little slow, but picked up and had unexpected twists. It wasn't as good as the first, though.
B009P5S11G|5.0|love Rihanna, this is awesome cd as all her cd's are .Preordered it love the song Diamonds .And i got a dvd with it of her concert .How great it that .
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is so fun. I love the graphics and sound effects and the challenges are great.<br />I would recommend this game and buying it.<br />Well worth the money.
B0091LS07E|5.0|I'm a fan of Alicia  buy all her cd's  enjoy this one what a voice . Couldn't wait  to get it and put it in my ipod
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Challenging with many levels.  I found it very addicting while watching TV or just relaxing the evening away. Worth the effort.
B004GBIDVW|5.0|I was impressed that this came with the cardboard sleeve, and all the discs looked like they were brand new.  The shipping was fast, and the product was perfect.
0061733199|5.0|I love the outdoors and this book and it's mini companion are great resources.  A lot of information is packed inside with great pictures/diagrams.
0743270754|5.0|I decided to read Team of Rivals after listening to Doris Kearns Goodwin on Charlie Rose and Tavis Smiley, followed by seeing the movie, Lincoln.<br /><br />Team of Rivals takes the reader behind the scenes of the average person's understanding relating to Lincoln and his rivals. I was never fully aware of the actual facts that supported historian's views why Lincoln was such a brilliant strategist. So for me, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln provided the answers.<br /><br />Lincoln turned his rivals, Seward, Chase, and Bates into his cabinet. He must have concealed the belief, `Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.' The insight to how Lincoln manipulated behaviors was a treat for me. I enjoyed understanding how his mind worked.<br /><br />It took Doris Kearns Goodwin ten years to research Lincoln's presidency. Team of Rivals is a book every reader will enjoy and come away with a better understanding of Lincoln's brilliance.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|' The Misremembered Man&#34;<br />  This story had a personal apeal to me. My father was sent to Catholic orphanage as a boy here in the U.S. around 1917. He ran away so many times they finally quit looking for him so he lived on the streets of a rural town or in the barns where he could find work. He had a happy ending, but with many bad memories, some he shared with me, some he did not.<br /> 'The Misremembered Man&#34; story takes place in Ireland and the author does a great job of puting the reader right there. She mixes humor with this tale that  lightens some of the heavy realities of the times. I was hooked from the first few pages and had to find out how things would evolve. The story was well written and surprised me at the end. I would change only one thing, that is the heavy use of the Holy name Jesus. I understand that it fits the culture and the times so the author was being authentic. That's just my personal opinion. GREAT STORY, WELL WRITTEN. LOVED THE ENDING.
0767819543|4.0|I had to watch this movie for a class in college. It was pretty good for a foreign film. I would recommend. Would probably need a dvd version since vhs is almost obsolete.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|very evocative of our experiences in India. Great acting; we especially love Maggie Smith.<br />We got DVD, did not try video download.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|An endearing story told mainly in flashbacks and a small peek at the social structure in the South in the 1940s.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes love stories and/or Hallmark Hall of Fame movies.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Great!  This product is wonderful and just a joy.  It has made my life better having it. Will look for other items like this one.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was one of the best that I have ever read. The detail was phenomenal and you don't need any first hand knowledge to understand the events. Six stars all the way, not five!
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Great.  This product is wonderful and just a joy.  It has made my life better having it. Will look for other items like this one.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I love Christina in this movie as well as Cher and Stanley Tucci. It's enjoyable and showcases Christina's voice well. A keeper for sure!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great read.  This product is wonderful and just a joy.  It has made my life better having it. Will look for other items like this one.
1594135592|5.0|Well written and an interesting idea...but it really is long...if ya have the time, its worth reading...used it for a book club and it produced good conversation
B004LWZW4W|5.0|Great movie. This product is wonderful and just a joy.  It has made my life better having it. Will look for other items like this one.
B000002HAJ|2.0|Cd case was cracked in all directions and cd itself had a white cloudy substance all over it. Not very happy with this purchase.
1401235166|5.0|Greatest story. This product is wonderful and just a joy.  It has made my life better having it. Will look for other items like this one.
B001EYGOG0|5.0|It is the dynamic Tony Bennett at this best with the Count Basie Orchestra giving that Christmas Big Band sound.
0062101897|5.0|Great gift.  This product is wonderful and just a joy.  It has made my life better having it. Will look for other items like this one.
B004CORQKC|1.0|Order the Deluxe Edition for Chirstmas present my Mom that is in a nursing home she is only 74 years old but need the constant care . I was thanking that the Deluxe Illuminations had much more then the Special Edition version that I could have got on amazon 19.00 to 29.99 . But no I ordered the Deluxe version for 79.99 from this company and it the same edition put deluxe in front of anything and wow people can charge what they want . Will not recommend this company at all . WHAT A RIP OFF !!!!!!
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Great!  This product is wonderful and just a joy.  It has made my life better having it. Will look for other items like this one.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|This has some of the best jazz music ever.  Not only wonderful vocals, powerful lyrics, the music is mixed beautifully to give a wonderful presentation of sound and art.  First time I heard the song 'Painted on Canvas' I knew this was a must have CD.
B004NEY9EW|5.0|Very tight film that gives us plenty of Bond's audacity and refusal to quit, making the character attractive--cool--in spite or because of its imperialist mode, most clearly summarized in the gratifyingly calm decision of those cool blue eyes. The film tries to divest him of those colonialist attachments. Tricky business.
1577314808|5.0|I think this is such a wonderful book I have given away many copies of it.  There are many different aspects of life covered. I think if not all, at least some parts of the book can resonate with most people.  I like the way Eckhart Tolle includes questions a reader would ask and then answers them.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good easy read. Sweet love story. Would read another book by Mira Lynn Kelly. Cute romance. I Enjoyed ready it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think these books are hilarious I have read all of them. I've also seen all the movies to they make my laugh of the day.
0811875040|1.0|I just finished making the Lemon Shortbread Cookies.  Am I the only one disappointed with these?  I thought they were a lot of work for some pretty flavorless cookies, and I had even added extra lemon.  I have made many other recipes for shortbread cookies that were much more flavorful.  I think they would have been better if I had brushed them with cream and then added the sugar on top like a scone.<br />  Also, locally milled organic flour and sugar cane?  Really?  How many places in the continental U.S. mill their own sugar besides Florida? There is no place in my state, that is for sure. And how much sugar cane is REALLY organic?  Do you think that a farmer is going to hand pick all the insects off his 5,000 acres of wheat or sugar cane?  The term organic is used so loosely now.  Just remember that \\"organic\\" does not mean the same thing as \\"USDA certified organic.\\"  I think Meg sounds very pretentious when saying this.  I must argue that cake flour is not tasteless.  If it is good enough for Julia Child's Reine de Saba  cake, it should be good enough for anyone.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Very readable.  Translation is easy to read and understand and provides and stays true to the the original novel by Hugo
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are really great to watch.  Downey's personality and dry sense of humor makes all of his films shine.  Jude Law is a good actor and a great &#34;stable&#34; side kick to Sherlock.<br /><br />If you like these two actors you will like the Sherlock series, the Iron Man Series, The Holiday, Only You.
B000007XUQ|5.0|I am greatly enjoying the Carpenters Christmas Collection.  It is one of the best Christmas Collections in todays market.<br />The Carpenters Christmas music makes my holiday joyful and complete.
B008602KQI|4.0|After reading all three of the books the film was less than stellar.  It was entertaining but the script could have been beefed up and the characters developed better.  I wanted to see a better difference between &#34;Capital Have It Alls&#34; and &#34;Dearth in the District&#34; lifestyle.  Also, the most important element to me was the political, progressive ramifications the book has and that was not developed at all to my satisfaction.  The gladiator gore was definitely there (not too gory, the director spared us, thank you) but the reason why they had spiraled down into this type of deplorable entertainment was not as obvious as I would have liked it.<br />If you want the political side...read the trilogy.
B003VANOFY|5.0|In love with surround sound  mode!! Works all around the house too. Great for blocking most but not all sound
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Another hit from the Bourne series. This one is almost as good as the others before it. Jeremy Renner does a fine job as the latest super soldier.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Love the multiple formats. Makes for convenience when trying to watch it with friend who may have different devices at home
B002XSP16A|2.0|I was extremely disappointed in the album.  I don't know if it was the download or what, but the songs were not what I expected.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Bought for my grandmas kindle fire hd. Not much use so far but simple enough. It's facebook, kinda normal....no complaints this far
B0053TMP24|5.0|This was the best book I have ever read Cain wait till the 3rd. Rick make the best books ever.
0061537934|5.0|This book was wonderful, well written.  There were so many wonderful lessons about life and death but have a positive affect at the end.  I related the part about racing well to many other things in life.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book. I fell even more in love with Eva and Gideon. I can't wait for the next book to come out.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|The positive on this app is familiarity. It looks just like the full big-brother version. It is not fast like the its windows version but takes care of the needs
B003F9G8B8|5.0|Instead of focusing on the traumatic issues that made Mandela an icon, this movie presents his ways of leadership into a form that we can all learn from and follow through with our own actions.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Omg they even give you points for failing!!! And for playing every day. Works great on my KF.  How they give this game for free is amazing. You will like the easy directions and diversity of the games.  Enjoy.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really liked this book but did not enjoy the second and didn't even start the third because of disappointment with the second.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put this book down, read the whole book in a day's time :D loved it, can't wait to start the second book
B00A7ZWUJC|4.0|This album I admit I didn't like at first..cause it was different from her last album so I didn't give it a chance. But I listen to it a couple more times an I love it! Now that I think about it I was like that with her last album &#34;Talk that Talk&#34; Rihanna albums are never a disappointment there just always different..an I'm being to love that about her. My favorite so is &#34;Loveeeee Song&#34; and I hope there a video to go with it soon!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think this app is cool it has some challenging levels. Some of the challenging levels is fun to try to figure out this game is really fun
B00AMBH70S|2.0|If you shut your brain off, this is a great action movie.  However, the underlying political premise that our government kills it's own agents at the first sign of liability is completely ridiculous.  Did Michael Moore come up with the idea for this plot?
B003O86FMW|5.0|Once again another great book I couldn't put down the minute I started it. Can't wait to start the last one. Sad to see the series end but eager to find what's to await Katniss and all who she loves.....
B00A2IUHM6|3.0|This was a fairly funny movie. It was above average, but did not have me laughing alot. Worth watching again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's the best book I have ever read! I had to keep reading it! I would recommend it to everyone! I just wish Katness would tell Petta that she loves him and it wasn't for the games she really does love him! That is the only thing I want to change about the book. But other than that I'm in love with the book. I just got it on Christmas and I have already read it twice! It never gets old!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|at first I liked it but I hate it took all of my coins twice and the people I got.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved the book/ absolutely amazing. Would definitely recommend this book. Going to buy the second book asap. Hope it's as good as this one.
B0072OFOM6|2.0|The actor that starz chose to substitute Andy whitfield does not have the same talent for acting, the series lost great quality in that, and if it wasnt for Crixus, it wouldnt even be worth it to keep watching!<br />Better put more struggle on your skills Liam McIntyre.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I give this book a 5 because it's not like any typical plot I've read. I had no idea what was going to happen next.
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|Arnold is Arnold, the rest is the rest, no other comments necessary, he brings the best of his character, and also is in great shape.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I really like the quality of this Kindle Cover. It's supple and comfortable to hold and fits the Knlde Fire very well. My previous cover was the 'original' , black Kindle cover.<br />The only things that I could possibly find fault with is the lack of a hand hold, but for the way I read, this is no issue at all. I like the rich red color - not too loud and not too quiet.<br />Very good quality at an affordable price - what's not to like?!
B0013KTGAG|4.0|Crazy plot but I liked the music and the imagery.  Has some really good actors that I like. Would have loved to have seen it on the big screen.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Once I started reading, I could barely put it down.  It's been a long time since that happened to me and I love reading.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was  the first book of Sparks' that I read and I loved it. I can't wait to see the movie!
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|the app is excellent! but once... twice....three times....four....five... it stopped at FIVE that I got burned or scribbled or exploded on level &quot;dragon's omlette&quot;. I just use the app for new characters and other levels. would give it four-in a -half stars if I could.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Only Mahjong game I've tried for the Kindle Fire HD but it works well. Occasionally the tiles look like they're free when they're not but it's easy to realize the mistake. I've gotten zero, one, and three stars on levels, but I'm not sure I'll care to go back for all three stars ever.
076115728X|5.0|This is a very sweet book whose main message is one some children benefit from exploring....making something out of a mistake.  Colorful and simple.
B00846REIS|5.0|Good book, i have problems with the obvious theft of the plot line from an existing best seller, but if I hadn't read fifty shades first I would easily say this one was better. If you can get past the synopsis I guarantee you will thoroughly enjoy this book.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Battery hog that is often wrong about local weather (Riverside, CA). Most recently it failed to report or predict rain despite NOAA predictions and the fact that it was raining. Meanwhile, it runs constantly despite my best efforts. Uninstalling.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Really enjoyed the story followed previous book perfectly...keeping me suspended and wishing for the next book.. Riordan really does satisfy
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I bought this as soon as it was released and have been very happy. I can carry around my bluetooth headset without worrying about loosing it or breaking it and keep it charged so it is ready when I need it. This makes so much sense: combine a case with a battery pack that recharges the headset without being plugged in! Just keep the case charged up and then put the headset in when you're not using it.
B005HSL626|4.0|this game is super addictive and very fun, the reason j gave it 4 stars is because it rodent have multiplayer and it freezes during zen and classic mode sometimes, but I play it on the old Kindle fire and otherwise the freezes, it works GREAT!
B000002GWJ|5.0|sorry, im not a music critic, cant talk about the instrumentals or composition.  its just tom waits.  never disappoints me
030758836X|5.0|I've never written a review before, but this book is completely worth it! The story takes amazing twists and turns that keep you wanting more. It's an easy, fluffy read, so it's great to cuddle up under a blanket and crack open! I would absolutely recommend this.
0385523912|5.0|i admit it.  im a fiction reader.  this is my first non fiction foray in a while.  well, this reads lile fiction.  who knew?  learned alot, a good read.
B001S2PT3M|5.0|I received my purchase in a very timely fashion and enjoyed having the product as it was a gift for someone
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|If you liked Born To Die you will also like Paradise.<br /><br />The songs are fantastic, there is not one that I do not like. The standouts for me are 'Cola' and 'Gods & Monsters', both of them with wonderful melodies. The lyrics of 'Cola' might offend your sensibilities if you get the explicit version, however the sound is sublime.
B008MM9630|4.0|It is an ok game. I just pop in a couple of times a day and harvest my trees..work on some goals..then leave.. it is not really a time consuming game for me. I really don't get into watching grass grow. At first it was real fun but my plot of land is too full to put anything else on it and I can't get any bigger without spending money. I did buy some items but just don't see spending money on land expansion.
B00932AA5G|5.0|This Norwegian film is such great fun. We open with a man who is a headhunter by day and an art thief the rest of the time.  He uses both to maintain an absolutely lavish lifestyle. He then steals a painting from one of his headhunting clients who was a tracker and killer for the military,  This is where the fun begins, a cat and mouse game where there is one audacious attempt to kill after another.  The pace is electric on this and the adventure is first rate. There are multiple twists and turns. This film shows that action adventure films can be done with creativity and intelligence.<br /><br />note: my husband also viewed this on netflix instant. he liked it but was complaining about its being so violent.  i seem to have a higher tolerance for graphic violence than he does. so if violence really bothers you, you may not like it as much as i did.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B001TH16DI|5.0|I bought this set for my best friend for Christmas. Not only did it arrived expediently, its packaging was pristine. Plenty of protective bubble wrap to keep these bad boys nice and safe on their journey to my doorstep.<br /><br />These movies may not be the best. Gene Roddenberry had apparently done his best to run the Star Trek into the ground with these movies, but they are cult classics that Trekkies are not going to want to miss, despite all of their rough patches.<br /><br />I would recommend this collection to any Trekkie I meet. Live long and prosper, friends.
B004EPYZQC|1.0|This DVD stops in the middle of the show. Now I am going to buy another and not a used one.
B0086700CM|5.0|very fun, great  at keeping my attention, glad i found this game, the upgrades are fun, i play on the kindle fire.
B001C1066E|4.0|I really like this frog wallet, it just needs to be broke in because it is veryy puffy and doesn't look like it will fit much money in it. But other than that I would recommend to any naruto fan/
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Started out slow, but then it became very funny.  Great writing.  As for the plot, not much, but the writing earned it the four stars, otherwise probably would have been worth only 3 stars.
1594487154|5.0|Most people recoil from the idea of being a salesman, but we all sell every day -- ideas, causes, products. Dan Pink helps us understand the theory and the practice of selling in ways we can use at work, with our family, and in our community.<br /><br />I am a longtime and big fan of Pink's work -- from his days at Fast Company, hearing his talks at conferences, and reading all of his great books. I received an advance copy of this book at no charge from the publicist, but this review is my own opinion -- I just got a chance to read it ahead of its official publication.<br /><br />As he has with Pink's earlier books, To Sell Is Human helps us think about ideas that matter in our lives, gathers the best research, synthesizes and explains it, and provides practical advice. I particularly enjoyed his calling on the important research of business professor Adam Grant, formerly of the University of North Carolina and now at Wharton.<br /><br />Pink's writing style is engaging. (If you've ever heard him talk, you can \\"hear\\" his voice and sense of humor as you read). I'm sure that I'll return to this book when I need to refresh and refocus my efforts to persuade, convince, and motivate others.
0307592731|1.0|I am just glad I checked this out from my library and didnt pay for it. Cant belive ophahabook club has it on thier list. Someone knows and owns a favor I think on this one. This book is aq waste of time.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|When I saw this movie the first thing I thought was &#34;this is an actual thing? People do this?&#34;  I had no idea birders took their hobby so seriously.  One of the funniest movies I've seen.
B0000A5A0T|5.0|While I am very sure that his debut album [[ASIN:B0025X4OYS Coltrane]] is spoken of pretty well by most jazz lovers,I'm not sure if it qualifies as one of his classic albums exactly. He signed up with Blue Note shortly after,retaining bassist Paul Chambers from his debut along with the addition of trumpet player Lee Morgan,pianist Kenny Drew,trombone player Curtis Filler and Philly Joe Jones on the drums,who himself would soon be working with Miles and Coltrane in the studio together. The combination of the confidence of a now fully formed change in lifestyle for Coltrane,the addition of the very like minded new musicians into 'Tranes flock as well as the idea of recording on what was already becoming a pretty legendary jazz label in Blue Note all made this to be the first seminal recordings of Coltrane's career.<br /><br />  This album consists of a series of extended numbers,starting with the bluesy,trombone heavy title song,which of course goes from there into the like minded \\"Moments Notice\\". On this and the lively,uptempo closer \\"Lazy Bird\\" it's Chambers' arco bass lines that really stand out to me. On the uptempo and wonderfully melodic theme of \\"Locomotion\\",it becomes clear what an excellent trombone accompanist Curtis Fuller is. He is able to equal Coltrane's round and spiritually lived sound on his trombone to the point where it does seem as if there is an unspoken musical connection between the two musicians. The Johnny Mercer/Jerome Kern standard \\"I'm Old Fashioned\\" get's an equally beautiful treatment from 'Trane on tenor,showcasing his gifts for improvising one grand melody from another,right after the other.<br /><br />  Realizing before even listening to this that I was about to experience a jazz classic,even I was surprised how many of the melodies on this album,namely the title song,I was already quite familiar with. This is an experience I've often had with Coltrane going back to the first time I experienced a great sense of deja' vu upon hearing \\"Giant Steps\\" and \\"Namia\\" for the first time,having not formally heard them ever before. I would say this speaks volumes for the sense of communication that Coltrane's compositions and playing can have on people. And also notable is that he did compose all but one of these numbers. I find myself wondering how many newcomers to jazz or the music of John Coltrane first heard this album and experienced the same sensation of deja' vu  as I did. Music,after all,is it's own language. And impacts on all of us in different ways.Giant Steps\\" and \\"Namia\\" for the first time,having not formally heard them ever before.

B004YM6JLO|5.0|Read the books in high school and love this series.  Couldn't wait until this came out on DVD.  Love it.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I got this because my daughter is obsessed, but as I watched her play I could see she was learning to balance aim with tension to obtain her goal.  Each attempt/level she decreased the amount of time it took her to figure out how to hit her target!
B007UWBQEU|5.0|This is an amazing album.  I love to play it in the car and at home.  Her albums get better and better.
B00A757EFW|3.0|I got this because I remember sitting for hours as a child playing this game.  I loved it then, like it now.  Its addicting, but the joystick takes a bit of getting used to.  High frustration level at first, but it eases off once you get used to it.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This series is hysterical.  I love the cast and the storylines.  This is a great DVD and highly recommend it.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|i love this game. it is way better than temple run. but whenever i go onto the app it blacks out and i have to exit and go back on again.  other than that this is an awesome game.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am so looking forward to season three!  I wish we could have it available as soon as it airs in the UK!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Excellent job of the last book of the trilogy, I especially enjoyed the last of the book as from the perspective of Christian. I'm hopeful that the author will write more in the series soon!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|The DVD was cheap, in plastic (unopened) just as described, brand new.  Watched the movie and so far no scratches...definitely recommend buying from this company.  And quick delivery.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Good action flick.  Actually fell into place with the prior Bourne movies, but  I would have liked to see Matt Damon have at least a cameo in the movie, he is , after all, Jason Bourne.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Pretty good esp for a free app. Not the most exciting but fun. I enjoy it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone
B0050DIWFC|4.0|An excellent novel with a number of twists and turns.  While the whodunit ending was not completely a surprise, there were a number of posssibilities to consider.

0375851569|5.0|I purchased this set for my grandson's first Christmas! Dr. Seuss books are just great and this is a terrific price for the full set.
B005COO1X6|2.0|It was very predictable and I disliked it, because I didn't like the story line although I like Stephen King. It seems as though he made the story up really fast and he didn't put a lot of time into the making of the story.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Simple and fun. Plenty of things to do in the game. I perfer games without the 'energy' concept. I enjoy this game.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|First couple of pages I didn't think no would  get through this book but then I got so into it an  I didn't want to put it down. It made my heart swell and I just love  everything about  it. This  book is.  Keeper for sure for any girl that loves love stories. It's about commitment, denial, heart ache and of course love.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Not as good as the second. Pleased with part of the ending, not pleased with other parts. But all in all, excellent trilogy.
0399160450|2.0|I do not think this book is up to the standards of Clancy's early work.  I usually read a Clancy novel (Such as Te hurn for Red October or Red Storm Rising is less than two days.  I have beenreading this book for two weeks and am only halfway through it.  Not recommended except to direhard Clancy fans.

0375413405|5.0|My son is a 21 year old special needs \\"child\\" who has adored Julia Child since seeing Meryl Streep's portrayal. For Christmas I got him a \\"French Chef\\" DVD collection, and this classic cookbook. We've only attempted the Boeuf Bourguignonne, but it was amazing! Exploring the recipes will be a fun experience for us both... If he ever lets go of it!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I give this rating because I like the game but I think they should give you more coins than they do but the game is a great one.
B008X8QCTO|4.0|Another great game from alawar games. However like all their games it randomly restarts and I have to restart at the last save point. Galaxy 3s user.

0380713802|5.0|Bill Bryson is a gifted writer, able to weave laugh-out-loud humor with poignant rhapsodizing while tossing off tirades against changes that have conspired together to ruin America or the world in general.  \\"Neither Here Nor There: Travels in Europe\\" manages to include all three as Bryson retraces steps he took as a college student in the 1970s and backpacks across Europe twenty years later in an effort to relive those days and to see what has changed, or sometimes, what hasn't.  It is a riotous mix of laughter and good times but more often than not a candid look at the problems facing Europe (in the early 1990s) and the problems of the tourism industry.<br /><br />Byrson begins his travels in Hammerfest, the northernmost point in Norway during the frozen winter months, so that he can observe the Northern Lights.  From there, Bryson moves in a zigzag south and north, ranging from Paris to Belgium to Germany to Sweden to Italy to Eastern Europe to end in Istanbul.  At each place Bryson comments upon the beauty (or lack of) in the local landscape and architecture, spends his time wandering town centers and interesting museums, in search of good food, good beer, and good times.  Overall he is successful, his twenty years from the first journey to this one making him a wiser man who has learned a thing or two about the world and isn't easily swept away by sights he saw the first time around.  Mixed in with Bryson's current observations are reminiscences about his first trip with his friend Stephen Katz and memories of his life growing up in Iowa.  Bryson offers many laugh-out-loud moments, like his wonderings about sex dolls in Hamburg to his belief that cows are the perfect pets.  But he also offers up some sad but true observations about how we live: \\"We used to build civilizations.  Now we build shopping malls\\" (page 105).  We build without beauty and with no need to last.<br /><br />\\"Neither Here Nor There\\" is a delightful journey with a witty and observant tour guide.  At times, Bryson's wanderings seem redundant - at each new place there is a hotel room to be acquired, museums to visit, digressions to make - but being that he takes readers to places they may never have been before, it is a welcome diversion.  Just as with \\"The Lost Continent,\\" Bryson's book about traveling small town America with the hope of finding the perfect small town, Bryson tries to find that idealized European village that existed in his childhood imagination from movies he watched.  He finds it in the most unlikely of towns in the least visited country, a village seemingly untouched by Western influence.  But that was over twenty years ago.  It's time Bryson took the trip again.de.

B007N85POS|5.0|of all the angry bird games. I play too much, have it on my PC as well as Kindle. Highly recommend
B009O2XY12|4.0|this game is similar to bubble witch saga, except with cute babies your saving instead. I recommend this game, very cute.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|and when it became available for the Fire, I got the full version. It is a little harder to play on the smaller touch screen, but I like beating the timer and solving the puzzles. Still a kid at heart.
B007HO392S|5.0|Great high energy CD. Good for any mood. Got as a gift and so happy. I definitely recommend this CD.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I got this free for my Kindle Fire, then found is has fewer games than another app which I also got free. No problems with the app, but I like toe other one better.
B0087JTAKW|2.0|To say this text was &#34;slow moving&#34;, gives it way too much speed. As with most Mitch Albom books, there is a moral at the end of the story, but it isn't much of a moral and by the time I got there, I could not have cared less. Character developement was great, because it was minimal and truely all that was needed for the reader to grasp the situation. I would say this book might be better suited to Junior High readers, but most of them would refuse to stay this bored, for this long.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|I like it ok but, but do not plan to get the full version. You can only play so many match 3 games, they cannot have very much variation, after all.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I am new to Nicholas Sparks, I have watched a lot of movies from his book, but didn't realizie it until recently.  This is a great read, kept my interest, easy to follow.  Feel good book!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I finally gave into a trend and glad I did. I can't wait to read the next one and see the movies!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I have so enjoyed these book and I am impatiently awaiting the 3rd!! I have read a lot of other books by this author and she is wonderful!
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|The visuals of this movie are mesmorizing. The banter is contagious. 'Why does yogurt night have to be so difficult&#34; is one of my favorite lines in the movie. Great for a dreary day!
B000YHG72E|5.0|Elf is such great fun and has become one of our Holdiay classic must watch movies.  You will love it too!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Rod Stewart's timing on these Christmas Classics is really cool. There are only so many really good Christmas songs and this fresh remake of some of the best of them is really great
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This is not Grisham at his best, to much complications and hardly credible. He may be influenced by the demand for Crimi's that makes good sellings.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|great movie, enjoyed every minute, the old man and the young runt are more than fun. The ending is most unexpected. Wonderful.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I like the pace of writing, not too fast, giving time for thought.<br />I enjoy reading books that are more then just action.<br /><br />Les miserables
B0080BFWE0|5.0|This movie has always been a favorite of mine! Pricing and quality of my order were great! I highly recommend buying!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game. it is a cute and fun game that both me and my girls play on here. my only issue is not having any other pony neighbors.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|loaded and installed on my kindle fire with no problems. I was not expecting that I would like this game. I have never seen anything like it. can not believe it works. and it is very entertaining. great game for all ages.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|For a true story I thought it was a really good movie. Would have given it a four and a half almost five. Very interesting.
B00APUQPX6|4.0|Great family movie.  We have enjoyed all of the ice age movies and this one did not disappoint our family.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This books makes you think. Everyone will enjoy it. It takes a difficult issue such as molestation and deals with it in an honest way.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|With regards the movie itself, it is undeniable the best in the trilogy. Period. Also, the blu-ray experience of The Dark Knight will blow your mind! Make sure you buy the single-disc blu-ray version (with the Joker on the cover)!!!<br />Excellent purchase!
B006YTTVHO|3.0|It was a really quick read and might help someone. It focuses on helping you become more comfortable in your own skin.
0316227706|5.0|If you're a dog lover and have had a bad day, these pictures will make you just out laughing for sure!!! The looks on the dogs faces are hilarious!!
B00A77II0U|4.0|This was my first game downloaded using my kindle fire and I was impressed! The story was creepy and captivating. It was never frustrating either as the developers included a wonderful little character to help whenever I questioned what to do next (I also strongly encourage users to take advantage of the map feature). My only regret was in wishing that the game would have gone on longer.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this game is so much fun! anyone who likes dragons should play this game. perfect for kids too! great game!
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|I love Clancy but the last 2 books I've read by him have been a little weak and this was no different.  Even though my favorite characters were there, I found it lacked the warmth of someof his earlier work.
B007SSDBBM|4.0|Good job mixing the old with the new, even if like a fairytale, with great acting by both Ryan and Jackman.
B008G8SFGO|2.0|The cover makes the claim of no ballads and no filler. Yet, most of this collection is  unimaginative copies of other mediocre metal bands.  I gotta give the old geezers their props for being able to rock as hard as any young Turk (They are in their 60's after all - but you would never know it by the energy in Monster).  Gone, however, are the hard-rocking AND melodic vocals from their old albums.<br /><br />You have heard all of Monster before - from other 80's hairbands.  The vocals are repetitive and sing-songy.  Think of the following lines in Warrant's Sweet Cherry Pie and you will have heard the vocal melodies and cadences in more than a few of the songs in Monster:<br /><br />\\"Cool drink of water such a sweet surprise<br />Tastes so good make a grown man cry<br />Sweet cherry pie, oh yeah\\"<br /><br />I really was hoping for a great Kiss album.  This is not such an album.  Monster is full of filler and melodies recycled from dozens of other mediocre albums.  Insert any heavy metal singer, a new album cover and presto-change-oh - you have another hard rocking album indistinguishable from just about any other.
1609613937|5.0|I started following McDougall's plan during the Christmas celebration. Straying off the diet was inevitable! But, getting back on the next day was very easy. I look forward to the meals and that is part of my battle. There is stress eating that is satisfying and it is the McDougall way. You will love the recipes and looks for his other books. I feel energetic and am loosing weight!
B009G7ZYPY|2.0|She is a great technical singer, beautiful voice, no question. The problem with her is that she doesn't \\"feel\\" the songs or \\"convey emotion\\" through her singing. She sings these songs straight without any feeling. Listen to other artists sing these songs and you will see what I mean. I want to hear joy, anguish, tears, heartache, and all I hear is clear, crisp, singing without any feeling. Barbara Streisand is the master of conveying feeling when she sings; Michael Jackson did it as well with pop songs. Until Susan Boyle learns to do that, she will not grow as a singer.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I rated &#34;Gone Girl&#34; as it's okay. I'm  only half way through and I've read several other books since starting it. To me that indicates something is wrong, but not enough to delete it quite yet.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|My kids and I watch this every year around Thanksgiving to kick off our holiday season.  Lots of laughs and reminders of what is important in life.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a perfectly done calculator app. It is easy to use and yet it does everything I need it to. This app runs flawlessly on my Kindle Fire.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is such a fun addictive game. I leave it running while I do dishes or cook dinner and let the coins accumulate. Works great on my kindle fire.
B009CPES4I|4.0|A bit of a downer as older folks find themselves on unanticipated hard times.  Their circumstances lead to unexpected conclusions and a good ending.  We liked the movie.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Nice, free Bingo game.  You get additional tokens each day just for logging it.  Great for passing the time without too much concentration.

B005G6G5CA|5.0|Tony Bennett is one of our favorites.  You can tell we are not young.  It is always a treat to hear him sing.
1416550550|5.0|I don't read a lot of fiction, and certainly not a many mysteries as they so often feel repetitive. The Forgotten Garden, however, is a gem - never trite, overdone or shallow. The characters feel incredibly real; their actions, while sometimes maddening, are all completely in line with the flaws and weaknesses of human nature. They are not evil (well, most of them!), just trapped by their circumstances and fears and striving for their hearts' desires.<br /><br />The scenery was vivid and easy to picture, and the foreshadowing and hints deftly woven together to create revelations, connections and happy tension as you try to guess ahead of the characters and figure out the twists and turns. The transitions between decades and storylines was neatly done and smooth.<br /><br />This was my first time reading a book by this author, but it will decidedly not be my last!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|This game is unique in its approach to telling a story.  You begin by learning about your surroundings how you can interact with the world.  Eventually you solve simple puzzles and experience a grand scale and get to witness beautiful digital scenery naturally through your playthrough.  The game is taught organically; you have to learn by experimentation and your curiosity pushes you forward.  The music is beautiful and emotionally stimulating, matching the expansive wonderful creative world put together by Thatgamecompany.<br /><br />Flow and Flower are very simple games that involve purely using motion to interact with the worlds.  Flow is a game of an organism's survival, and Flower is a visually spectacular but mechanically repetitive game of travelling through the air and mustering a group of flower petals.
1616202416|5.0|This is one of my favorite books and I have read it several times; each time finding something I missed the time before. My bias lies in my belief that Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is a ridiculously masterful writer.<br /><br />There are so many aspects of the story that I loved that it is hard to just single out one, but I most closely related to the depiction of the powerful, sometimes dangerous, and sometimes saving hold that family and tradition can have on a young girl's life. The voice of the main character is quiet and fearful at first but as the story moves on becomes more clear and sure.  The reader is able to watch a young girl come of age in a country, Nigeria, that in some respects is also coming of age. I loved the way the protagonist begins finding her voice; first through the help of others, and then through her own determination - with one of the catalyst being love.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I read all 3 books and liked the story.<br /><br />The movie doesn't deviate much from the book.  Jennifer Lawrence's performance was spot on.<br />I look forward to movies of the other two books.  I also liked the performance by Woody Harrelson.
B000FC10WU|5.0|I enjoy Agatha Christie mysteries. Always keeps you in suspense until the very end . I would highly recommend this author to anyone who likes mysteries.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|***This review may contain spoilers***<br /><br />  The title of my review references Peter Jackson's utterly unhinged zombie infestation cult horror classic.  In \\"Dead Alive\\", the unlikely hero decimates zombie hordes until the screen literally floods with blood.  In a way, \\"Django Unchained\\" (hereafter \\"Django\\") reflects \\"Dead Alive\\"'s \\"go nuts with killing until you stop being scared and disgusted and just have to laugh\\" sensibility.  As Django (Jamie Foxx) ascends from slave to bounty hunter to talented gunslinger to determined avenger and savior, the viewer is inundated with so many killings, humiliating tortures, mutilations, and explosions, he/she may stop being disgusted and overwhelmed, and simply laugh at the brutal inanity of it all.  I think that was director Quentin Tarantino's intentional satiric objective.<br /><br />  Reviewer M. Oleson also alludes to \\"Blazing Saddles\\" as one of \\"Django\\"'s inspirations, and I think he is correct.  However, satirizing the West's violent ignorance and flimsy attempts at justice were, I believe, Tarantino's secondary targets.  Even the abominably shameful institution of pre-Civil War slavery and the unscrupulous but dense Southerners who strained to uphold it is a secondary, easy-bullseye for \\"Django\\"'s satire.  As other posters here have mentioned, Tarantino, as he has done before, is slyly satirizing our near-sexual fetish for and obsession with and gradual desensitization to violence in general.<br /><br />  Many people are shot in \\"Django\\".  The lucky ones die quickly with little blood.  The unlucky ones realistically scream with pain as blood erupts from them like geysers.  Initially, the audience may recoil or cheer in response, depending on whether the character shot \\"deserves\\" it or not.  But eventually, poetic justice does prevail in \\"Django\\" and we laughingly and apparently appropriately cheer as decadent, immoral Southern plantation society is literally blasted to smithereens.  But will we necessarily respect ourselves the following morning?<br /><br />  No matter how you feel later, I think \\"Django\\" viewers will be entertainingly uplifted, not only by Django's composed, steely determination to avenge his bondage and to be reunited with his abused but beautiful and equally resilient wife Brunhilde (Hildy) (Kerry Washington), but also by the unflappable reasoning and eloquence of Django's own deliverer, the deceptively unassuming Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). But even Django's reprehensible villains are also humoroulsy captivating, such as the unctuously effete but vicious pseudo-Francophile Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), the slimy \\"Candieland\\" (ho ho!) plantation owner who holds Hildy in thrall, and especially the obsequious but treacherous Candieland slave retainer, played by the endlessly versatile Samuel L. Jackson. Of course, they suffer shocking deaths, but Candie and Stephen come so skillfully close to being such cartoonish heavies, again we permit ourselves to cheer and laugh when they die.<br /><br />  Tarantino in a sense has it both ways with the violence.  We are allowed to enjoy the violence when a villain buys it, but we do shudder with loathing when the \\"good guys\\" suffer.  When Hildy is locked naked in a hot box for some perceived slight, or Django is hung upside down naked with castration imminent, I'm sure almost no viewer will laugh.  So there's our ambivalence towards violence and death - are they cathartic or poisonous? If violence's victims are faceless zombies as in \\"Dead Alive\\" or foolish Southern whites (who cant even make KKK masks with periperhal vision) as in \\"Django\\", we laugh with relief.  If violence's victims are the geeky hero in \\"Dead Alive\\" or suave slave-turned-avenger Django or wily, rational bounty hunter Dr. Schwartz, we cry with despair.  Especially in light of recent serial killings, this evocation of violence's dual nature merits further debate.t ourselves the following morning?<br /><br />  No matter how you feel later, I think \\"Django\\" viewers will be entertainingly uplifted, not only by Django's composed, steely determination to avenge his bondage and to be reunited with his abused but beautiful and equally resilient wife Brunhilde (Hildy) (Kerry Washington), but also by the unflappable reasoning and eloquence of Django's own deliverer, the deceptively unassuming Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz).

B00APUYN0I|5.0|Good one liners as well as some good singing during the movie. Would recommend as a comedy as well as a good music movie
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Fun game. Great graphics. Only downside is that i spend too much real money upgrading my gear. Have patience if you don't want to go broke.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|This is a great album but I returned it as I bought 2 by accident. This is a great band to listen to.
B00948EPOQ|4.0|A simple yet poignant message set in a captivating city. The film draws me to watch it again and again
B000SGRONM|4.0|Fun holiday read. Liked the first short story, the one about the adopted daughter and the Dutch Santa the best
B00992CF6W|1.0|Kids love this game because they can play games with friends.  Unfortunately  this doesn't seem to work between kindle fires.  My kindle fire can join a game started on an iPad but the iPad or other kindle fires cannot join a game started on the kindle fire.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Only downside is how quickly you run out of energy. I like the balance of the game, good for adults and kids alike.
0385344333|1.0|I have been disappointed in Lee Child since he sold the film rights of his Reacher novels to Tom Cruise. I think it was one of the biggest sell outs in current literary history. Reacher is 6'5\\" and 250 pounds and his size is one of the essential elements of his books. Tom Cruise is not. I saw Lee Child interviewed and he said there weren't any Hollywood actors of that size. I would have nominated the guy who plays Opie on Sons of Anarchy. So what if he is relatively unknown. It seemed to work okay with Sean Connery in the James Bond series.<br /><br />  But I digress, this is the book not the movie. I would like to know who wrote this drivel. It can't be Lee Child. This is the most improbable plot ever. It didn't make sense to me. The ending didn't make sense. The big unveiling moment was flat and made me utter, \\"What?\\" The novel was so boring about riding in a car, speeding, blinking out signals with the eyes for no apparent reason and so many side stories that were irrelevant to the plot. Did I say plot? Sorry to give you the wrong impression. I don't think there was a plot.<br /><br />I have not been so disappointed since Janet Evanovich decided to rewrite the same novel nineteen times. I understand she is not writing the books anymore and her daughter is. Of course, that can't be much of a job since it's essentially the same book. Now Lee Child appears to have sold out too. I am more devastated as the Reacher books were so great. Yet another author I won't spend a dime on. I just can't understand how an author who created such a great character could care less about him. I'm sorry for you Reacher. You deserve better.
B005NFJAT4|5.0|Very well done.  Historically accurate. Acting is very professional and holds your attention for the duration of the film. I love it.
B001JRB16U|5.0|ALL IN ALL... DISNEY CLASSIC! 45TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION<br />BETTER VIDEO QUALITY THEN VHS, IT WILL HAVE YOUR KIDS SINGING A LONG WITH HER.
0316212261|5.0|I bought this as a gift for someone who enjoys reading as much as I do.  We love irrepressible heroines and some humor, so these books fit the bill.  I had read all the books and loved them.  Where else would you expect to find Vampires, Werewolves and Queen Victoria complete with a supernatural advisory board.  If you love offbeat, fun reads these books are for you.
B008G59IKO|5.0|Billie Joe gave us their most personal history here, and it's completed with the whole trilogy, he's just a genius, putting music to a single real life history in a most perfect way! this album is so amazing and thanks Amazon for help me to get it once released
1577314808|5.0|The Power of Now should be recommended reading for every human being on the planet. Eckhart Tolle is a living luminary and his teachings are vitally important for all of humanity if our fragile planet is to survive.
B008XJM6NY|5.0|This edition is fully suitable for put the 3 albums together, it looks very nice in my collection, and it's highly usefull, those albums are one together, there's no way, they must be into this set.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|I really was struggling to find a planner app I liked.  This is it.  easy for me to use.  easy to see my day and week.<br /><br />my only complaint is that I cant figure out how to sync it with my phone and tablet.  it duplicates everything and puts the times into a different time zone.  but for my tablet its perfect.
B008G59IBI|5.0|New fans, recent fans and old school fans will love this album, it's just perfect! and complete a great trilogy which you should have together.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonderful book! I loved every page! The movie and the book were similar with just a few changes. I will definitely read the other books in this series.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|My Grand Daughter really seemed to enjoy it a lot and as an adult was fairly entertaining had a lot of good elements and a lil suspense and mystery which I appreciated
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Some parts are sad, some I would like to see a little better developed, but in the end this is a much more realistic look into the happenings of such a pseudo utopian society amidst a power struggle, and the fallout from post war grief and trauma.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|Have not really used it very often am currently using spotify....and am fairly satisfied with it before that I listened to you tube and I really don't see the need to pay for music
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting! If I could I would play it for HOURS!!!!!!!!! Its the best!Way better than temple run.
1444757202|4.0|This is a book with a very good plot that makes you read continuously to find out a rather exciting end. Worth buying.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Didn't I say, Gideon was a better man then Christian?  Hmmm.... ladies?  I thought so!  If you enjoyed 'Bared to You' then this will be even better....happy reading!
0689862725|5.0|If you are a collector of Stephen King's books, this is a must have. This book is well made and entertaining. I have it on display in my living room. Absolutely not complaints and I would buy it again!
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Gideon is wonderful, a man you will fall in love with and he is more of a man the Christian Grey.....just saying!  Happy reading ladies!  Get the sequeal immediately....'Reflected in You'
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|IT was one of the best books I have ever read in this series. Looking forward for the next one
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My 6 year old daughter loves this and it will keep her occupied for quite awhile.  It's a very good app that teaches problem solving skills!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love all her books and this book just kept getting better and better.  I am actually sad that I finished the book. Can't wait to see what else Colleen comes out with next..hopefully I won't have to wait to long.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|the knife itself was good but my box came and looked as if it had previously been opened . still a very sturdy durable knife also the sheath is very durable .
B007HACDLK|5.0|Like every other Vince Flynn book it's great.<br />Action packed Mitch Rapp at his finest doing the dirty jobs no one else can do.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Saw this was the free app of the day and decided to try it. Played a couple of levels are really like it so far.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|The movies was different but a little slow. Ended up falling asleep. can's say anymore than what was already said.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a fun game, but I wouldn't pay to play it. It takes way too long to accumulate investment points (obviously they want you to buy some). Also, I'm not a member of Facebook, so I miss out on the points you get for posting. And I can't get rid of those pesky goal icons encouraging you to post a city photo on Facebook.
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|The movie was pretty good. I thought it would be a little better. It did seem to have some inappropriate language in it for children. And I didn't like the way it was made that much.
B007L6VR12|5.0|Wes Anderson has a near-perfect command of this movie.  His sets, dialogue, characters and plotting are immensely intelligent and entertaining.  There was one disturbing scene of sexuality but otherwise very good story, very good movie.<br /><br />And as usual, Jason Schwartzman steals the show.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We just finished watching this on DVD.  Just as good as the first time around.  Highly recommend it for it's production values and writing.  A few times it strays a bit too much into soap opera territory, but it gets back on track.
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|Which is why this movie is watchable but unbelievable.  No woman in her right mind would cheat on George Clooney.  His facial expressions are wonderful.  It is a decent, unremarkable movie with a simple flaw at the center.<br /><br />The entire movie I asked myself how anyone could have cheated on George?!
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I got one good laugh at the end of the movie when Ted wakes up after being torn apart by the field medic from Saving Private Ryan and it was a joke about Ted pretending to be disabled.  My 13 year old self would've died at that joke.  The rest of the movie was just not particularly funny or endearing.  And, I say that as someone who laughed pretty hard at the joke about disabled people.  Also, couldn't Seth McFarlane come up with a voice that doesn't sound exactly like Peter Griffin?
B0063IH60K|5.0|clear graphics, easy to use. happy with it. ads after every game but it keeps it free so its fine by me
B00AMBH70S|3.0|But this was largely a meh experience.  In the Matt Damon helmed Bourne movies there is always a very clear rationale for why things are happening on screen.  In this version, we're meant to feel bad for Jeremy Renner but I never really bought into the Flowers for Algernon story line.  Edward Norton (who even knew he was in this movie) is totally underutilitized.  I thought they had a nice setup with the story parallelling the last Bourne movie, but it didn't really go anywhere and man does the movie just end with a dud.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I chose five out of five stars mainly because of the cost and quality of the product. It comes a matte finished box with a book, several discs, and excellent apparel. It only cost me $27 and I'm loving the movies. In my opinion, this trilogy is and will be a classic forever.
B00633W614|4.0|I can't wait for the next book in the series!  I really hate the suspense until May comes along.  I'll be purchasing the next when it comes out.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I really enjoyed the game, puzzles that were fun and an interesting storyline! Puzzles were not too hard but I never got bored!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series is great!  I couldn't put the book (1-5) down.  Had to find the end and how it all happened.  You can guess why they are in underground silos but you really don't find out until book 6.  I do wish I could learn more about Juliete though, and so far with book 6 I haven't.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I've been using Daytimer calendars since the late 1980's, and this app for my Kindle Fire does all I could ever need and then some! I thought I would need something much more expensive to replace those little books. What a pleasant surprise to find such a great way to save some trees!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|An incredible story of beginning new life despite being through hell and back.  Whatever encourages the readers to erase the hate in our lives...if she can...we all should be able to!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This vane is fun. 2 bad it's a demo. I would like to okay the full version without paying for it.<br />The puzzles r interesting. The mystery us very well written. Should. E free or cheaper.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|Funny, quirky, good time.  Would recommend to others for sure.  Bill Murray was great.  Best Bruce Willis role in awhile.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Dan Brown has done it again.  A twist at every turn...thought provoking...mind boggling.  And all the pieces come together at the end.
B000002J1U|5.0|My Favorite Led Zepplin Album by Far.  My son, who received it for Christmas agrees. Surprixe - I didn't think I liked them that much.
1895565669|5.0|My husband got this for me for my birthday!!  I loved it!!  This was my favorite book to read to our four sons!  Very special and was in great condition.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|5 stars! Nicholas Sparks at his best. Great love story! Fast read!  You will not be disappointed. Loved this book!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|hi I love mystery games but this one is cooler then I<br />thought it was going to be like.it is about a lost city.<br />I do not want to tell you too much because I want you to be surprised. but I'm a COOL GAMER!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|If you're a fan of Seth MacFarlane, you'll love it.  I think it was stretched a bit too far to make a full blown movie, but it's totally worth it.  It was so funny I'm looking forward to buying the blu-ray to watch the outtakes.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Nearly everyone in my 5th grade class has read this series. I see why everyone says that they loved The Mark of Athena. Cannot wait to read the next book.
1619692376|3.0|Baldacci needs some new material.  Too far reaching on some of the plot.  I will still read Baldacci books but maybe read some other authors for a change.
B008PE9GSA|3.0|Same old, same old, nothing different, nothing new. Boring. Get a best of hits and you will be much happier.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|Total Recall was OK. Long drawn out fight scenes and sometimes a bit boring. We found ourselves wandering off while it was playing. The first Total Recall was more fun. This movie would be worth watching when it becomes free on Amazon Prime if you have a couple of hours and nothing else to do..
0805086846|5.0|This is a heartbreaking book , difficult to get through but one that I feel everyone should take the time to read
B009HV2JT8|5.0|The title of this movie made me not want to see it. I decided after reading the reviews to watch it anyway. What a great surprise it was. Don't expect much in the way of historical accuracy, just sit back and have fun with it. I don't re-watch movies often but I would watch this again anytime.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|good game interesting backgrounds many different rooms lots of things to find dark rooms are kinda difficult, always penalized for something you can't help
B008JAGZDE|3.0|It was a good movie.  Nice to see the progression of the characters and how their lives had changed.  Funny.
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|Follower of the series, this was the worst!!  Felt like I was watching cut scenes from the video game. Here's your special tools, this is your mission, follow the map...blah blah blah....waste of time and money. Thumbs down!!!
B0098VXBIA|3.0|The movie was funny at times.  Not the continuous laugh I thought it would be.  There were many parts that truly reflect what pregnancy is really about.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|I have to caveat this first, I am only about 70% through the book but I am Intentionally finding time to read this book. Very well written from the first chapter on forward.  This is probably one of my first Sci-Fi books. I heard about it from Goodreads.  I am very impressed so far.  Extremely enjoyable.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Movie was good, just moved a little slowly.  Tookj a long time to get to the conclusion, and then it just ended abruptly.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Beautiful soundtrack! Movie was spectacular and the ability to listen to it again and again is great!  A must have for anyone that saw the movie!!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I was not sure what to expect with this movie, but was pleasantly surprised.  Amy Adams is great and Eastwood is was convincing.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is AWFUL! There are at least 5 sayings that are used 3 or 4 times in every chapter, the storyline is completely 100 percent NOT believable OR interesting, and I found myself checking the percentage read after almost every page. This book reads as if it was written by a 15 year old who read too many cosmopolitan magazines. Save yourself the time and energy and don't read this horribly written book!
B00APUQT7I|4.0|It was very good. Enjoyed the idea that the &#34;pack&#34; is growing. Love all of the characters! I love all of the Ice Age Movies!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|So glad I waited and purchased this 8 DVD set. My family really enjoyed this and I wasn't able to purchase at target or Walmart due to the set being &#34;vaulted&#34;  ;)
1616284382|5.0|Great book, great pictures, drawings, and commentary about a Great Movie and story line. This is a book you'll want to hand down for generations to come. Share the magic with you children, and grandchildren, they will love the journey too into the Wonderful World of Disney!
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|The book had a sad, but realistic, story about a man with a torturous upbringing in an Irish orphanage.  Despite the topic, the book had humor and an upbeat ending.  It was disconcerting to learn that such orphanages existed into the 1990s.
B0073V7YTY|3.0|This app worked well for me and provided information that was useful in convincing employer that sound levels in equipment room were not conducive to employee ear health.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I think it was a great book and I recommend it to anyone who is up for a good mystery!
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I laughed out loud a few times, loved the characters , and  found this to be a really easy read.....finished it within a 24 hour period.  I wasn't expecting the ending, but loved the world of support and love that Charlie is surrounded by. Would I read this book over and over again? Not really sure, but I'm glad I read it at least once!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is the best book I've ever read IN MY LIFE I'm only 11<br />But I'm a total book worm and was 100 percent over my expectations :)
B008XX6J4C|3.0|They are talented musicians but the music on album was not what I was expecting; was disappointed.  I doubt that I will ever play again.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I love this book I can relate to the main character greg he is Funny witty yet his life seems to never stop getting weirder
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Its a good book. . .but its written as different interviews or accounts. . . most of the different interviews are well written and interesting. . .but some, especially about the political side. . .are extremely boreing!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing if u buy or borrow it then it's worth it thank you Suzanne Collins for making such an amazing book
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|really enjoyed playing the game. the traffics were good and the story line was great. gotta love g5 games. can't. wait for another game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had no idea what this book was about, and had no interest in the movie when it came out. But my daughter put the book on our Kindle, so I started reading it. I couldn't put it down! I loved it so much, I finished it in one day, and now I'm going to watch the movie. Then I plan to start reading the next book. Needless to say, I'm a fan!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The three books are incredibly. They suck you into another world. I would recommend these books to everyone I know.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It was very helpful pronouncing the words and learning about the orgins, so thank you Amazon and, Kindle Oxford Dictionary.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|A good read for anyone. Keeps you wanting to know more. It got me. I didn't guess who did it.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I really like the app but it has frozen my kindle fire twice when trying to animate the map. couldn't turn off or put in sleep mode. had to let the battery run down.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It was an amazing app.It challenges you.IT is fun and teaches you about angles and what might happen if you steal a bird's egg.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was a good read, but it was disturbing on many levels!  It will make for a good discussion at book club, but it is not one that I would ready for enjoyment's sake.
B005CRQ2XA|4.0|Great. Book tag is not an tag book and of course you should try dork diaries if you love diary of a while just wimpy kid.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was a good follow up to the first novel.  I found myself more attached to the characters during this installment.
B002APU580|5.0|Since I haven't read the novel (but have read a couple other Jane Austen novels), I went in with no real expectations - and my wife and I enjoyed the movie quite a bit. Keira Knightly definitely earned her Oscar nomination, and the cinematography of the English landscape captured the essence of the Jane Austen style of writing. The best thing I can say about the movie is that now I need to download the novel for my Nook/Kindle!
B000FC1HBY|4.0|This is the second book of the game of thorn.  I am enjoying the read and like the book, but in the kindle version it is sometimes hard to remember all the characters and who they support.  I love the character &#34;Imp&#34;, he is smart and you never know who he is really supporting, besides himself.
B007V65R54|1.0|Could not come close to finishing this boring book. Forget about this nerdy, weirdo, modern day crystal ball gazing stuff that is really no better than flipping a coin. Read \\"Antifragile\\" instead.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|One of the best books I've read this year! It is rare to find a novel that is so dynamic, the plot was fantastic and the narrative style was some of the most skilled story-telling I have seen in a long time.
B008D19WBQ|2.0|The extra footage that was added to the DVD release is missing from the Blu-ray release.  The missing footage was great, and my girlfriend was hugely disappointed when she discovered it was missing.  Additionally, there is only a minor improvement to picture quality - nothing impressive.  If you care about the extra content, get the DVD or wait to see if they ever release a Blu-ray version with all the footage.
B005LAII3U|5.0|this was a great movie with outstanding special effects. I really liked how they used some of the old story line mixed with a new story line to make a fantastic movie.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|This is a very well produced concert of ACDC. The sound quality, on 2 speaker is amazing@!!! And the concert is very well produced for anyone wanting a good ACDC DVD.
0763655465|5.0|I'm pretty sure this book could have been written about my dog! It's a tale of a dog left alone who tries so hard to stay out of mischief, but can't rise above the many temptations. This book is funny, easy to read & the illustrations are very unique & tell a lot more of the story than the words. Highly enjoyable for the kids & adults reading to them as well!
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|this who done it, is really entertaining to see! The way it ends up is crazy!! And it's very well done!
B004LWZWGA|1.0|This is only a review on the Digital Copy  ... the movie itself was a 4-star thriller - Highly recommended.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Digital Copies and often choose your movie by which has the best DC, don't buy this version.  They have made downloading this movie an absolute mess, forcing you to join 2 different sites - UltraViolet and Flixster - to be eligible to get it.  And while both assure you of the ease of use, if you intend to download to an iPad, well, forget it.  The apps their links provide do not allow a DC to get to your pad.  While it may cost a few bucks more, go ahead and get the superior Blu-Ray version which allows for a iTune DC.  Much, much easier  ... my copy of this is going back to Amazon.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|Led Zeppelin gets together w/ the Drummer's (John Bonham's) son Jason. They did it to honor/and for their Record exec/producer Ammet Ertegun. First time in 27 years that they were back together. Here is your only chance to see it. 20 Million requests came in to attend the 02 arena in London, in 2007 of course. Fat chance in &#34;H&#34; that we'd got to see that one!!!! Here it is. Hasn't been on TV yet either!
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I'm a little irked that I bought this less than 48 hours before it became the FAOTD. Sigh. Still a cool new game to kill time with. ;-)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|For a free app this calculator is the best! I love the big numbers. Its so easy to read and it has all the functions.
B002OSY2T6|3.0|I am pretty sure that in the commercial, the snail is moving along by itself. We were disappointed to find out that the snail only moves along as a teaser to the child when they push it across the floor. With that being said, the product is okay.
B0095R6OBS|4.0|I didn't read the description very carefully & was thinking that I was going to see the new release.  So, once I realized my error, it was time to reset my expectations.  This is a live action short.  The storyline is very straight forward & provides a reminder to look beyond our own prejudices & judge everyone on their own merits.  The photographic style was dramatic & somewhat surreal.  The acting was a bit over the top but appropriate to the style of the film.  Overall, it was an offbeat but enjoyable film.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I use this product daily.  It is a must for all of my writing projects.  I would download it again.  It is simple and easy to use.
B006LS7DQE|5.0|I bought this game recently & I'm addicted.  It's a combination RPG & match 3 puzzle game.  The RPG part is fairly simplistic.  First you select your charactor which will come with some specified attributes depending on whether you choose a barbarian, sorcerer, etc.  As you go through the game you will begin to collect quests which will earn your rewards once completed.  You can select your current quest from the list of active quests & it will provide arrows showing you what direction to head in.  You do have the opportunity to select the weapons, armor & spells you will use in your quests.  These can be found or purchased & may be upgraded using resources your have collected.  All of your battles, searches etc. are match 3 puzzles but there's a twist.  The battles allow you to use 1-2 weapons & 5 spells.  In order to use the spells you must collect a specific amount of gems of one or more colors.  For the weapons you need to collect a specified number of fist icons.  You are playing against your enemy & must use up his life points before he uses up yours.  Each different type of creature has a different set of attributes so your strategy must be changed a bit depending on who your are fighting.  According to the game there are 250 rooms so there's a lot to keep you occupied.<br /><br />On the negative side this game seems to be a bit of a memory hog.  As I have progressed I have had to uninstall other apps from my Fire to make room for the increasing size.  It becomes obvious that there's a problem when the game becomes sluggish.  Once more room has been freed up, it speeds back up again.  Overall though, I have really enjoyed this game.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I started reading this one morning and finished it the same evening.  Great story of strength, survival, and new beginnings. I love this book.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I love this book. A GREAT read! One of my new top favorite fun and romantic books:) I definitely recommend this book!
B000J103WA|1.0|Should be rated 0 stars - This DVD will not load on either of my Blu-ray players or on a computer disc drive.
B002APU580|5.0|This movie is so beautifully done! I first watched this only last year and I have fallen in love with the story ever since. I have seen other mini series and films of Pride and Prejudice, and this one is by far THE best! The cast is so beautifully done! I love Keira Knightly and Matthew Macfadyen as the two main characters! This movie is fantastic and I highly recommend it!
0307236722|5.0|I found Martha's Baking Handbook to be very informative and easy to understand.  She provides a step-by-step walk through of her recipes that make it easy for the home cook to turn out a beautiful, tasty end product.  Bravo, Martha !

B004LWZWGA|4.0|The Dark Knight Rises is an entertaining movie, although much different than the other Dark Knight movies.  This one is still an action movie, but there is also a ton of drama involved.  The movie was technically well done, but I wonder if some might be put off by the direction the story went in.  (Possible spoilers up ahead)  There is hardly any Batman in this.  He comes in quick little spurts, but then doesn't really show up until the last half hour, by then some may say `too little - too late'.  Batman and Bruce Wayne have never been played as great as Christian Bale plays him.  He has a charismatic presence on screen.  The filmmakers decided to make Bruce Wayne a recluse who has been hiding out in his mansion for a couple of years after taking the blame for Harvey Dent's death in the previous movie, even though he had nothing to do with it.  The public naturally ostracizes him as they typically do without knowing the facts.  It was unclear as to why Bruce Wayne is limping with a bad knee and body for half the film.  It was uncharacteristically like Bruce Wayne who has always been into taking care of himself.<br /><br />Bruce Wayne and finally Batman do come out from hiding when a new villain more destructive than any other surfaces.  The villain in this movie is a character called \\"Bane\\" played by Tom Hardy.  The character is evil personified, but he is a big man with a muzzle over his mouth and nose, which is assumed that it helps him to breathe.  The villain is probably the least interesting villain in all Batman and Dark Knight movies, however a lot of uncomfortable deaths happen at his hand or  by the thugs that work for him who are happy to die without question.<br /><br />There was a lot of talk and hype about Anne Hathaway playing Catwoman, but after the movie came out I never heard another thing about it.  I wondered why and after seeing this it was because she was barely in it and when she was on the screen, it was an understated performance.  She was more of a regular person who was also a jewel thief as opposed to the version that Michelle Pfeiffer mastered in Batman Returns as a deranged soul who comes back from the dead.  Pfeiffer's Catwoman is still and will always be iconic, but Anne Hathaway did a great job portraying a different type of Catwoman.  She also had visible emotion and sympathy over the things going on, when Pfeiffer's Catwoman never batted an eye lash, but this is of course due to the script.  They were merely giving their best performances with what they were given.<br /><br />Despite the shocks and surprises of wondering why the filmmakers went down the road of being darker and more depressing, I still enjoyed watching this movie.  It ends in a way where it becomes known that Joseph Gordon-Levitt who plays a cop and good guy who helps Batman has a real name revealed: Robin.  This could be a taste of what happens next in the series:  Batman and Robin!ore of a regular person who was also a jewel thief as opposed to the version that Michelle Pfeiffer mastered in Batman Returns as a deranged soul who comes back from the dead.

B007X4ECMI|4.0|A great action flick that does not depend on the stupidity of the good guys to make the bad guys bad.
B0078XGEK2|5.0|This book helped me get through a major transition in my life and I pick it up whenever I want some insight into life.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|I choose this rating because this is a classic who doesn't love the Griswalds.  Great hr an half spent laughing
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I love Downtown Abbey and was very excited to see the uncut British versions but it seems like a poor write to the blue ray disc. it seems like characters leave a shadow and move too fast. It looks bit-mappy in places. I streamed the same thing from Prime and had no issues. I also don't have this issue with any other movie so it seems isolated to just this movie. Anyone have any suggestions?
B008AK8FHM|4.0|His crystal ball is much more clear than mine has been on this topic.  If he isn't completely delusional (which doesn't sound likely) then I believe there must be something to the accounting of his experience that merits serious consideration.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|This book was very slow and not the ending I was hoping for.:/ I also didn't care much for the guy..
B0015DROBO|5.0|Incredible read. Great writing.<br />I can't wait to read the next book in the trilogy. It's waiting for me on my cloud...thanks Marin County Library.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Even my mom who hates playing games likes playing this one. It's different from all the other games that I have played. And it's fun!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well where should I start, just the same! The graphics are the same, creating something is the same thing. There is no bad thing to say about this app! The creaters did a great job with this game! :)
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Fifty Shades of Grey was not what I expected at all.  I knew in general what the book was about but was totally surprised how exactly the book took off.<br /><br />Although it was a good read, and I enjoyed it I can't give it 5 stars because to be truthful...what the character of Ana was going thru and reading her thoughts and whatnot, there were a few times where I think any girl would have run from Christian.  There was quite a few times I had a few 'you've got to be kidding me!\\" moments.  Cause like I said, any other girl this happened too (unless she had a hard shell, which Ana did not) would have left him from the start...<br /><br />Christian is what appears to be a nice--but rich--wealthy guy who had issues growing up.  What I totally disliked is he expected Ana to be 100% honest, even if she was only ever 'thinking' about doing something but he never felt the urge to do the same.  When Ana would try to find a way to get him to see how she felt about certain things--heck even talk (what a relationship is all about) and said \\"I did this for you why don't you do this for me.\\" he always put on that, \\"I never told anyone before so I'm not about to tell you' bit (which got to be annoying by the end of the book), and Christian's constant hovering got to be VERY annoying!  His constant bossiness and stalking qualities were not I expected, and it totally aggravated me throughout the whole thing. I have to say, as much as it stressed Ana out, it stressed me out too! Another annoyance was that she had a good 'guy' friend (no one she was going to date but wanted to be able to talk to) and Mr. Bossy wouldn't let her, but he felt it perfectly normal to talk to a woman about his life and that was okay...By the time the book ended I did see Christian's side of the story and why he did some things the way he did, but...it was still annoying to get to that point.  I think it was the whole not playing fair thing that got under my skin...<br /><br />I\\"m anxious to read the other two books, I think it is a catchy story!  Some of the scenes ::cough cough:: you know what I mean, were great and hard to put the book down!  I think those, in a way, made up for the other crappy parts of the story...but, still doesn't give an excuse for mr. bossy's actions.  I'm hoping he'll change in the next two books but we'll see.  Can't wait to start book 2 tonight!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Hard to read and follow but I want to get the essence before I go to the movie.  But so handy to have on my phone so I can read a chapter or two any time.  Thanks.

B007ZD17XO|5.0|much better than bejeweled.  this game has treasures to win and much more challenging. play it for hours and don`t want to put it down! well worth the money.
0452289963|3.0|It's ok indeed. I of course saw this on Oprah and she raved and I read it and thought it was an ok book. The lessons are reasonable though.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|if you like 80's music you will like this movie it is a musical but has some pretty funny parts
B003L77G06|5.0|This show just got better and it's the last season of the original Lilly. The stone faced adorable baby that never showed emotion or said a thing. Loved it lol
B002ZG999U|5.0|has good action a few scenes are a little dark but ok movie seen alot worse. would recommend worth watching at least 1 time

B00AE2J5HI|2.0|Stellar cast, great acting and production...but someone forgot to write an interesting story to go with the great actors! Waste of time and energy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was so happy how the book ended. I worried reading them that it would end the way I wanted it too and it did. Big time. To say I'm obsessed with these books are a understatement. I read them all so many times no one can tell me anything about these characters. I know them well.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game rock's and I think everybody should get this game . That's how good it is and I think your kids would like this game.
0780626966|5.0|There is no horror villain cooler than Freddy Kruger. Although as the movies went on, Freddy said the &#34;B&#34; word too many times for me but still loved him.
1449410243|5.0|Funny as and the drawings are cute too.  Anyone would think it was based on my domestic cat situation, only more so.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I got into this because 3 co-workers where reading it. The first co-worker explained it and it made no sense so I didn't think much of it. Then another co-worker had the book with her and showed me a line in the book and it said something like &#34;suck, suck...&#34; so I knew I had to read it. I was shocked at how fast I got into these characters and I can't say this enough, THIS BOOK IS NOT ABOUT S&M!!! That may be what gets people interested in it but when you read them, there's a whole story surrounding these two and I enjoyed reading about it and can't wait for the movie. Ian Somehalder for Christian ~~~
B000WAEK0E|1.0|I thought I liked Van Morrison.  I spent my complete listening time changing the songs.  There were only two songs that I would listen until the end. A waste of money. The buying/shipping process was great, just disappointed with the CD's.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|What a great idea to show families in their diversity. Cam and Mitchell are by far the best about this show. Oh and can't forget about Phil Dunphy.
B00AGH5LF6|4.0|It's classic and everyone should see it. But the digital copy of the movie cost more then the DVD and that seems odd to me!
161701091X|5.0|I love anything positive about MJ. I'm looking at the calendar right now and on Jan 1st, I can't wait to hang it up. Thanks!!!
B005ZUR724|5.0|My son and I are hooked. This is a great game but I tend to fall for in app purchases already about $100 in app cash that I have given them!
034580404X|5.0|I bought this trilogy so my mom could read it. I originally bought it on my Kindle Fire and read all three in a week and wanted my mom to read it. She needed the actuall books because I take my Kindle with me everywhere.
B000TSUCAQ|4.0|Good book we cant wait to make the things in it. Good condtion and ready to be welll used and loved

B006LSZECO|5.0|Both plot and characterization came together to create a fast-paced story which often left me wondering how the next chapter would go. Excellent!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I'm so glad I got this. I bought a skin-it for my Kindle but when I started reading books on it i.e. 50 Shades of Grey, i needed to be comfortable while reading.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I was pleased that for a free book, this was very good.  Story was a little too straight forward, not terribly complex, no character development besides the two main characters.  In fact, the other characters have almost no time at all.  It was like watching a play with only two actors.  I would have liked a little more depth, but still, it was the best free book so far.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I had a co-worker talk about this show all the time so I had to watch and wouldn't you know it, I became a huge fan and Bazinga became apart of my vernacular.
B0013LL2Z2|4.0|For something like 7 years now, I have been keeping track of the on again/off again remake.  The remake was supposed to be more in line with the book.  I finally gave up on that and bought myself a copy of the original movie.  It isn't very true to the book but I still enjoyed it a lot.
B00008EY9G|5.0|This movie was excellent. It had an amazing twist in the end that no one saw coming. Not predictable at all. Great movie.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was surprised by the sexual detail that this book goes into. But overall it is a great book and difficult to put down. I had the book read in just five days. I would definitely suggest reading this book!
B000W91RUG|5.0|I had a co-worker talk about this show all the time so I had to watch and wouldn't you know it, I became a huge fan and Bazinga became apart of my vernacular.
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|This film has moments where it seems dated but all in all it holds up well. Tippi Hedren was so beautiful, and her performance is fine. If you haven't seen it check it out.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This was fun. It took a while to know certain things down. But I got eventually got my money's worth.
B005HSL626|1.0|this app did not work at all. it is a wast of time to down load this item as far as i am concerned
B001B1UO6W|5.0|I remember when I first saw this it scared me. The first one was more &#34;scarier&#34; than the rest. They eventually went for comedy. But the initial idea was pretty creepy.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This movie had my husband and I laughing at the movies. I knew I just had to have it as soon as it was released. I preordered it. And with Amazon's preorder price match, I was refunded money to the super sale price. Can't beat that!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I had to hurry and read this one because the first one left you wanting to know what was gonna happen next. E.L. James needs to give me more Christian and Ana and NOW!!!
B005LAII1C|5.0|I love this movie. Had me and my family cracking up!!! Got an excellent deal on this movie. Arrived the day it was released!!!
B007BZM3HK|5.0|This song is the epitome of a song getting stuck in your head. This song was out for maybe a year before I finally gave in and started liking it. Still found it weird Carly's age. I thought she was a teenager. Never would have guess she was so close to 30.
B009JBZH54|5.0|My stepson loves this series of movies. Action packed, great effects, and a great value. These movies will see alot of viewing in my house.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|MacFarlane needs to stick to cartoons and stay out of the movie business of find a good script editor that knows the business.
1594487154|5.0|To Sell Is Human by Daniel H. Pink is interesting, thoughtful, analytical, well-written, and, most importantly, helpful.<br /><br />Dan Pink is an alembic. A what? An alembic. Think mad scientist (or maybe alchemist). An alembic is that funky looking glass thingie, round on the bottom, crooked neck, sitting over a flame with liquid happily bubbling away. The liquid is vaporized, travels through the neck into a curlicue glass dealybob and comes out the other end condensed and distilled. That's what Dan does; takes in a ton of information from our ever-changing world, percolates it, condenses and distills it, then jots down the results in a fun, easy-to-read, easy-to-understand style.<br /><br />This time, it's about sales.  From To Sell Is Human -  \\"... we're all in sales now.\\"<br /><br />\\"WHAT?\\" you exclaim. Yep. And that's all I'm gonna tell ya. You'll just have to get your own copy of To Sell Is Human to find out more. Learn about the new ABC's of selling (Attunement, Bouyancy, & Clarity), and the three key abilities; pitching, improvising, and serving, that will help you be the best non-sales salesperson you can be.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received a galley copy of this book from the publisher; however, the opinions expressed in this review are my own and haven't been edited or approved by anyone.
B001T6PXFG|5.0|Accurate and based on a true story, this movie details the courage and dedication of a few good Catholics who saw the real injustices of the Nazis in person and did what they could to preserve human life.  It also has a touching message about forgiveness and the realities involved with Christ's true meaning of &#34;Love thy enemies&#34;.  A film for our times, it's definitely worth the view.  It's also safe enough for the whole family ages 9 and up.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|This book manages to explains scientific and business information without boring you to tears, suggests advice without sounding like (too much of a) self-help book, and provides interesting stories about people and companies.
B0072V3AFW|3.0|The cigar came with Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood.  This film gets a nod as inspiring the spaghetti westerns that came later, but there's so much that was done poorly.  I got the feeling that the director thought that if there enough bullets flying that nobody would notice.
0545265355|5.0|The book set arrived in perfect condition. These books are an easy read with an interesting plot that flows quickly. Great books series for teens and young adults that are interested in becoming immersed in a fictional world.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I gave Grisham's, The Racketeer, four stars because his narrative held my attention and compelled me to turn pages to see where he was taking me.  When I got to the conclusion of his narrative I wanted to understand why things happened the way they did in the book and Grisham then proceeded to amplify all of the issues about which I had questions.  When he truly was finished and got to his ultimate conclusion I found The Racketeer fascinating, engrossing and very well written.
B0086700CM|1.0|It wouldn't let me shift over to get the other coins, I just stay in the middle. I normally love the game on my phone but, on kindle fire you might have a problem getting coins that aren't in the middle.
B000I8JEY2|4.0|Loved the first movie, was funny and realistic and the two together is non stop laughter.  I loved Martin and smith, I knew how they come up from nothing and have become great actors, especially Smith.  He can be serious and funny, whereas I can't take Martin serious in movies.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Nashville is the best TV show in years! The music selections are fantastic and add additional meaning to the stories. Can't wait for the next album!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It was really fun at first but then the games got more expensive then soon after i lost interest.the end
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Incredibly relatable, a lot of inspirational quotes. I loved it and I'd read it again. I feel like have to see the movie now.
B0098VXBIA|2.0|Why do we produce non fulfilling film work here in the states? No real romance or real action or drama to come away with after spending two hours bored out of your mind. Cameron Diaz and Jennifer need to grow up now. Same stuff just a different movie.  Let's try for an American version of Downton Abbey and maybe we might all learn something.
B002UXRGLG|4.0|I loved this but you can get it at Best Buy for $19.99. I could have bought 2  BBC videos for what I paid for this one
B0054R6BFM|5.0|It is a must read for teens!! This book addresses bullying and how one persons actions effect someone else. Loved this book.
B00785P2QC|4.0|fun time consuming game. needs better map. too much energy to be used on upgrading. would be more fun if real cash wasn't involved.
B00867GKIK|5.0|This movie is absolutely wonderful. The story is heartbreaking and hilarious. The animation is beautiful and the colors really pop. As for the 3D, it has some really great depth, but there are absolutely no pop outs, plenty of potential for some great pop outs, but unfortunately there aren't any, but don't let that distract you from watching it in 3D, because the depth really sucks you into the movie! Overall this is a must have 2D or 3D either way you have to check this one out!
B0036WHM1E|5.0|I don't think I've ever heard a better duet. Their voices work so well together, and the musicianship is absolutely awesome. Looking forward to picking up more of their work.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|I adored this book in high school, and the movie adds a whole new dimension. It's a beautiful film and worth watching. It could be triggering to a lot of people, due to the 9/11 content, but overall a wonderful film.<br /><br />I LOVE IT!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's great for when I'm bored. Not too tough and I get a kick out of seeing my four year old niece whip through them.
145210655X|5.0|Got this for my husband &#34;from&#34; our boys for Father's Day.  So cute and clever and any Star Wars fan will love it, especially if he's a dad of a toddler or preschooler.  (or has been)
B009YP9L7U|2.0|I chose this book because the description had my attention. The core of the story was clear, and it was a beautiful love story. But how it was written, it made me think a first draft was published. After 10 \\"only then\\"s, I stopped counting. At one point, there were four on one page. The author seemed to drag out details a little too long and skimp in other places.<br /><br />In summary, I wish the author buffed & polished it, but the idea was there.
030758836X|4.0|So clever and complicated in a no stress kind of way.  Pick it for your book club if you want something really interesting to talk about!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I read the sample because it had thousands of good reviews.  But I have gotten burnt lately in buying books based on lots of good reviews, \\"Slammed\\" being one of them.  I decided to read the one star reviews and decided to pass on this one.  After finishing the sample, I didn't like either of the main characters, and the profane language was a major turnoff.
0345803507|3.0|While I enjoyed the books overall I kept help noticing some glaring issues and mixed messages, for example if Ana is so strong why can't she stand on her own to feet without Christian? sounds pretty weak to me. Also why can't they both stop being so jealous and petty so a woman flirts with your husband or a guy wants to dance with you? So what? It's really not that big a deal they both act like they are in high school or worse. I also had a hard time believing in a girl who never masterbated and had no interest in any kind of sex until she meets Christian way to unrealistic. Also why get so hung up on a past relationship (I.E. Mrs. Robinson)frankly she helped him channel his issues Ana should thank her for guiding him into a life that made him able to eventually love her. They really all could have been friends if Ana didn't have such a stick up her A**. SPOLIER<br /><br />Lastly is the way to early marriage they needed to live together first and the pregnancy. Why is an abortion such a \\"dark road\\" why can't a woman make an adult choice in regards to her life and not forever be haunted by it? Why is she instantly bonded to it? What is so wrong with making a choice? Nothing that's what!<br /><br />That's what's wrong with these books ultimately the erotica is awesome and the intrigue in the story is good it's the wishy washy weak co-dependent characters that wreck it. The whole story makes it seem ok to marry after knowing a guy a month and go ahead have a kid while you're at it that always works out...Oh wait.. IT NEVER DOES!!!!<br /><br />In conclusion the fiction is ok just don't take it literally and if you find yourself pregnant an abortion is NOT a \\"dark path/road\\" it's a choice nothing more and you have every right to make it and NEVER be ashamed of it!!!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was told to check this book out and I do not regret reading this book. I am looking forward to reading the other books in the series.
B00004VYJC|5.0|Just this Christmas season of 2012, I was shopping at Wal*Mart and saw for the very first time, Teen Wolf on DVD (Region 1), sold by itself, for only $5.00.  It was sold in a Christmas ornament shaped DVD case, along side with other movies, which is/was new, as of the Christmas/Holiday season of 2012.  I kept waiting and waiting for years to get it on DVD, without having to purchase it as a double feature, with that awful sequel; Teen Wolf Too.  In a way, it was kind of a Christmas present to me, and from me.  Hopefully as of 2012, and beyond, it'll be sold by itself, without Teen Wolf Too.
B00005JKN9|1.0|Have had this movie in my collection for more than 8 years and we finally decided to watch it last night.<br /><br />To quote my 13 year old:  \\"Well we won't get those 3 hours of our life back.\\"<br /><br />I kept waiting for the movie to get better and it never did.<br /><br />It was a period piece I understand, and I wonder if it is accurate in its depiction of the time.<br /><br />No matter what, I didn't like it or did I think it was entertaining.  In any way.<br /><br />I like the actors.  DeCaprio is one of my favorites.  Lewis is always good, but I have seen this performance before in There Will Be Blood.  Total over the top psycho.  And Cameron Diaz was (in my opinion) not good for the role she played.<br /><br />The hype on the DVD cover which states it was nominated for 10 Academy Awards is deceiving.  It was not good.
B007R21JJK|5.0|not a single problem, works great, haven't OC yet, but everything else is great.<br /><br />The 8 pin cable is a bit hard to connect since it's at the top of the mobo, and if you have the power supply at the bottom and a fan at the top, it might be a bit problematic, but other than that, is awesome.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Works great and has a lot of information. I would recommended it for the price. D D D D D D
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Haven't used it's full power yet, but everything runs smoothly. everything loads really fast, and the cooler is smooth, but I could wish a better stock cooler.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|More twists and turns than you can imagine and an ending that you would never see coming. I couldn't put this book down.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|A thrilling and action-packed version of Snow White. I would recommend this for teens and older. The wicked queen is amazing, and the special effects are awesome!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Always the winding story teller, Kate Morton gives us a powerful story about multi generational secrets and how in the end all that matters is love. Will not disappoint!
B008602KQI|5.0|This is such a great story. The book is still a little better, but it is well-done. The actors and actresses are believable, and the story stays pretty true to the novel. I can't wait for the second one!
0345803485|1.0|I read this book to see what all the hype was about and from my perspective, it is a waste of time and the $10 it costs. The storyline is sophomoric and the character deveopment is non-existent.  You would be better served to read about BDSM on-line on the internet to learn about it than to spend your time with this borish book. Just one reader's opinion.
B00AEFVRB2|5.0|The people who bad mouth this film are just snotty nogood fuddyduddies! The film is brilliant......it is violent...there is nudity....but it is funny as all heck and a true work of art up there with True Romance!
B005LAIHPY|4.0|The effects were amazing in this movie. From the battle scenes to the very detailed aliens made this movie a keeper. The story could be more developed but, overall, a definite good addition to anyones Sci-Fi collection.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|So some people say they don't like it because of the upgrade which is reasonable but I mean u just get to play longer! And I think the game is great it has 132 games although u only start with 8 I think. Then when u do good on the games u can buy new games with the money you earn. ( Its not real money )
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I have a couple of these games and this one is the worst as far as i'm concerned. Don't buy it.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I like being able to get a variety of things and u can find just about anything on here..Good site
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Compared to some of the other books I have read, not my most favorite book, book out was a fun light read that was enjoyable. Would have been nice if there was a baby seeing as that was what the whole story was suppose to be about be overall it was a nice book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love all u have to do is tap the number or letter and it goes to where u want it to go u don't have to totally move it all the time..
B008P1EWIM|2.0|I was disapointted that about the only info it gave was temperature and one little blip about the sky conditions.  I've deleted it from my Kindle Fire in favor of downloading the National Weather Service web site which gives me detailed conditions and a 7 day forecast.  Where I live there is frequent wheather conditions that affect driving in our area.  It also took a very long time for this to download, so I was surprised at the scant information provided.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Love all the ways to hit the pig to get rid of them.. Love the graphics cool game to play..
B005OCFGTO|5.0|The order got to me sooner than expected.It was exactly what I thought it was going to be. Im very happy with my purchase!!!Thanks AMAZON!!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Like finding new ways to get to the pig and all the tricky ways u can get there and make things fall on the pig ..etc.. cool moves on this one too.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Very good book. Extensive detail and heart-wrenching. Highly recommended for any fan of romance and comedy. Very very good book
B005HSL626|5.0|there are special fruit and they are all banana's .. Love the ending it gives u a boost on your score cause of things u do during the game..
098555780X|5.0|Love it a lot and. Have show to several  friends and price was good to happy new year and  god bless
B0086700CM|5.0|Love that i can buy new people and get up grades if i do good ..and get as many coins as i can..your able to get high scores ..
B000FC2PKG|4.0|Great book.. suspense! I couldn't put it down. Dodge and Warren are two intriguing characters anyone can relate to. Gardner never disappoints.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|really enjoy the music on there and u actually get to learn how to play..Really enjoy this game..Love it lots
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Well written and fast paced with the appropriate amount of plot woven in from episode to episode.  A bit surprised that language such as s*** is used 3-5 times per episiode, even when broadcast, so it might not be suitable for pre-teens, if you are a parent and thinking about watching this as a family, and want your kids to control their language.
B0090YHSFC|4.0|A little frustrating. And it get repetitive quick. But all and all the kids like slashing things. Maybe I should be worried.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Excellent art and a logical story line, with full motion cut scenes. One of the best search and find adventures that I've played. A little dark for younger children, though.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great stories. Beautifully written.<br /><br />Sadly, too few episodes... But absolutely worth buying, it's really a pleasure to watch this series.
159420229X|5.0|My sister sent this one as a gift. It was very interesting, but I don't think I could master the method of memorization described.<br />The book is well organized explaining the ideas in clear detail.. It is short enough that it can be finished quickly. I would recommend it to my friends who like non-fiction.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I like the fact that all three movies are in Blu-ray and in one box helps keep them together for me.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|ridiculously addictive game.  straight forward game play. endless possibilities as to how you create your town.  wish energy replenished more quickly
B001EN71CW|5.0|What more can I say?  Firefly on Blu-Ray.  What could be better?  Having Serenity included is the only thing that would make this offer better.  :-)
B001F12J0C|5.0|This made a nice gift for a friend who is into the Bourne name brand. It arrived on time and played in my DVD player.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I read all 3 books and found as it went on it went from being just about sex to a love story. The 3rd book's ending was pretty much fairytale. but all in all I would recommend for a fun read. don't bother if you are shocked and offended easliy though. And just because you read it doesn't mean you have to try what is detailed in it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it its just like streeker run love that game its just like my favoret game ever ok hi love this game
B000H305U0|5.0|Hey I broke and scratched the first one so I had to order another one. I love this CD and he is such a talented young man. He is one of the best younger artist around. I also love his Justified cd as well. I grew up in the 70's but I really like the sound of Justin Timberlake. He is a real singer and a dancer!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Great book good writing skills<br />The new features that will make the right thing for a long term for your own company has also a good thing about it has a few weeks of this article to the next generation to be able the first to the first to the first to the right of the right now I know what the next day I have been in business administration has been the use or not be the next few years old man in the right of way for the next generation and I think it was not the first place of way that is a long way to get to know about you are looking at least two weeks after all over it is the right thing to be a good idea of this year.
B00000JPH6|5.0|We adore this movie. Its a great family movie which you can view with kids 8 and older without having to worry that its vulgar or explicit content in it.
B00A89ITZG|5.0|I've been following the Crossfit endurance program for the last 38 weeks and this book has now provided a simple, comprehensive reference guide for the elements of the program. It includes sections on the principles of Crossfit, endurance activities and all the various lifts and movements. So far it has saved me a few visits to YouTube searching for demonstrations.
B00003CXDD|5.0|We love this movie and should be viewed by children 8 and above. Nicely done movie for the whole family and lots of special effects and adventures. Fun fior the whole family providing their 8 or older.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|Better than original with touch movements etc... no clunky game pads or cords worth the $16 to own. U will not be disappointed.
B003Y5H5EW|3.0|I love all the Underworld sagas but this one is missing one key charactor and that is Michael, actor Scott Speedman. The movie just is not the same without that charactor because it was based on his and Salenes relationship with vamps and wolves.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My original charging cord died on my and would not charge my Kindle Fire with this new cord I am able to charge just fine!
B005FVFWOI|5.0|We love this CD and Jethro Tull is one of the best. I have this album from the 70's but I had to order the CD to listen to in the car. In my opinion, this is his best album/cd.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I just loved this book. It had me hooked after only reading just a few pages. Will definitely be telling my friends about this book!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I enjoy the fantasy genre from time to time and I can say without a doubt that this is the finest book I have read. The character development is amazing, the story keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the point of views don't rotate too much to make you forget what you are reading. Looking forward to Book 2!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|my finace wanted this movie for Christmas. I got it on here for $10.00 while it is still 24 in the store. it was shipped in three days. We are happy. plus its a good movie!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Perfect ending! After reading I feel completely satisfied. All the questions are answered and I'm left with a warm heart.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This book does not disappoint.  Harry Bosch at his finest.  Great story line and great details.  I love Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch novels.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies/series of all time. It is so beautifully done, and very very true to the original book. It's wonderful to see an adaptation where you actually hear the author's words! Costumes, props, locations, and acting are all superb.<br /><br />And how do you make it even more wonderful? Why, put it in Blu-ray! The remastering is such a vast improvement on the grainy original DVD set that we have. Lovely lovely lovely.
1439127700|3.0|The President's Club is a great topic.  It is not just about what former Presidents do, but how they interact with one another and the currently serving President.  Lots of the stories in this book were, to me, absolutely fascinating.  Clinton's apparent appreciation for Nixon and their long conversations, Nixon's regular desire to involve himself in foreign policy after his time in Congress, Truman's embrace of Hoover, and Carter's work for Clinton in North Korea and Haiti are just some of the good stories.  But the authors' framing leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />First, it is somewhat unfortunate that the authors think history started with, it would seem, World War II.  At least a chapter on prior post-presidential relationships would have been warranted.  For example, perhaps a reference to Adams' commission of George Washington as commander-in-chief as Adams considered war with France or Jefferson and Adams' long correspondence after their presidencies.  And those are just some examples off the top of my head, I'm sure a little research could have yielded other, interesting interactions.  What did prior presidents think of John Tyler's claim on the presidency after he took over for the first president to die in office?<br /><br />Second, there is no \\"club.\\"  That is a device the authors use inconsistently where they discuss \\"rules\\" (which no one seems to follow) and a club house across from the White House (that I swear, it seems is never used based on their writing).  I'm not a big fan of this device and seems somewhat unnecessary given the inherent interesting qualities (at least to me) of the topic.  In one interview with the authors I saw, the club concept actually caused some confusion as the interviewer seemed to think there was a special seal and letterhead for this club.<br /><br />Third, I wish the book had handled some material in a more systematic way, specifically funerals, inaugurations, and libraries.  How the ex-presidents interact witheach other (and the current occupant) around these events and where the traditions come from is worth a few pages of discussion.  Ex-presidents now attend inaugurations, was that always the case?  For the first part of the book, President Hoover is a major figure, but his death and funeral is never dealt with.  Who of his predecessors went?  I think this would have been worthy of discussion.<br /><br />This is a rich topic and the authors have ferreted out some good stories and relationships.  I recommend this book, shortcomings and all.
B0041KVW2K|2.0|I received my order a few days ago and the vinyl copy is defective have damage to the disc surface a grease stain does not come out with anything that causes my turntable needle slip and jump I've tried other turntables presents the same problem and I am very disappointed because this box is very expensive and the product lacks quality control<br />I hope you can give me some solution to my problem<br />very upset customer
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Had me on the edge of my seat all actors did fantastic.. If your looking for an action movie this will surely feed your craving
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen has done it again! Such a fantastic story. Full of mystery, heartbreak, and love. I enjoyed every minute of this book and I wish I could read more of Sky and Holder. Definitely a must read!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can so see why this book is on best sellers list. Was heart wrenching to read at times, there is an immediate connection with the charactors, and well after reading, left one thinking.  Took me 2 days after reading to even desire to read something else, of course now I am looking for other Collen Hoover books, so many quotable quotes in Hopeless, VERY Recommended!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book!!! I highly recommend Slammed and Point of Retreat as well. I can't wait to see what Colleen Hoover has next
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|fun to play with freinds. good at 12:29 pm. good for kids. while breeding nothing but a couple hearts is shown.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This was filthy. I shut it off after fifteen minutes..I hope it will get rated so parents wont expose their children to such trash.
B009KKLQKO|3.0|1.The lack of any Extras is  one reason why I didn't rate it any higher and<br />2. Why is God Only Knows song missing? and Where is any mention of Carl & Dennis Wilson?<br /><br /> Other than those 2 points it was interesting to see the remaining Beach Boys reunite- with mixed results<br />Glad to see most of Brian Wilson's Band  as the backing musicans- they are excellent- as Always.<br /><br />I was unable to attend any of the Reunion concerts  but I have seen Brian Wilson & his Band several times over the last few yrs and have all of Brian's solo cd's-That he is still making New music along with performing the beach boys hits is Special
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was a well-written story with a very likeable hero and heroine. Four and a half stars, if I could give it that.<br /><br />Half a star missing, because some of the 'mystery' became a bit too obvious by half-way through and some of the coincidences used to create the plot were just a bit too far-fetched. In all, however, it was one of the best stories I read in 2012. Wouldn't hesitate to read more from this author.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|.....Must read before you see the movie, if you see the movie, see it in 3D  Yea, yea yea yea
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I'm Beyond words. A must read for everyone. Chomsky does a magnificent job in format and creation of the book.
B004V9MU86|3.0|I bought this book because of all the \\"I loved it coos\\" from colleagues and friends. For me \\"The Book Thief\\" took me on a bicycle ride. The start an easy and enjoyable coast into the set up of setting and characters. The middle hit an unexpected and hard going incline, at times I thought to myself \\"just hurry up and finish\\". By the end however I was glad I persisted as zusak ties the end up nicely. However predictable that such oppressed characters and the miserable clime of their times, suggested things would not get better for all involved. The narration  by \\"death\\" himself gave the story an unusual and complex spin.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching fire 2nd book of the hunger games. I chose 5 stars because it was awesome, I wish I could give it 10 stars. There were no bass to this book it was a good book and I couldn't put it down.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I had to keep reading this book. I wanted to find out who did what and with each chapter I either had more questions or I thought I had it all figured out. I love that you never really know until the end. Flynn has a wonderful way of creating characters that so evil and wicked. I love that about her books! Out of the three that are out right now, this was my least favorite but it was still really good. I just personally liked Gone Girl and Sharp Objects better.
B00AECDDYY|5.0|I wondered how this game would turn out.  Well it is easy to learn and really fun. All in all it is well worth the 99 cents I spent on it.  Not a bad thing to say.
1451695195|2.0|This might have been a good read about NDE however the writer never stops talking about himself or trying to impress the reader with his education and brilliance. I'm not sure who or what he is trying to prove other then he is the smartest guy on the planet both before the experience and after. Yet the truth is, anyone with spiritual knowledge and experience, it's like watching a child take it's first step. They are so amazed with themselves, yet have no concept of the significance of the even. That is Eban Alexander. Reminds me of a primative people trying to discribe a space traveler and his flying machine, saw it, but can't really describe it.
140053271X|5.0|It has a great quality and it's better than I expected. P e r f e c t ! ! !
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My sister read it first.  So good.  Better than the movie. :) I read it in 2 days!  Can not wait to read the next one.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Great game and not too time consuming, unless you like to buy all the extras. I recommend playing until your out of energy and then simply come back to it later.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|nice big display, shows entire range of calculations.  Works just like a regular calculated.  Has worked well every tome I've used it
B000OLGCI4|5.0|It was a great experience to see my grandchildren watch and enteract (Dance and Sing) with the movie.  It was a true pleasure to see a timeless movie bring joy to another generation.
B000AYQNYI|4.0|When I finally got myself to buy this (and when the postman Pat dropped it right into my hands) I just speedily grabbed my earphones and threw the DVD into my player and listened it in awe while standing the whole time. It was just me and that moment.<br /><br />Gotta tell you, I wasn't disappointed. Only after several listenings I came to conclusion that the balance between the instruments are not the way I would've mixed it in some pieces.<br /><br />But overall very, very cool release.
B007SGM084|4.0|A great series that reads fast. A little different than other books but very entertaining nonetheless. Definitely not your ordinary romance story.
B006CHML4I|5.0|This watch keep time nearly as accurately as a quartz watch, and never a battery needed. Love the exhibition back, and the simple lean design, and it's not made for some freakishly huge person either.  The size and cost of my watch is not connected to my Ego, so it works great for me.  If you differ, seek your worth elsewhere.
B0015DROBO|3.0|It was ok. I'd heard amazing things about it and was not blown away. Decent book albeit a bit predictable. Reads like a movie.
B000AQJPQE|4.0|Very good for children, but planets do not light up so you can't see them with the lights out, but I still really enjoyed gifting this toy!
1594487154|5.0|A fan of Dan Pink since I read his book, Drive, I was eager and grateful to be provided an advance copy of his new book, To Sell is Human. It was an excellent follow-up, and has helped me change my approach as I work on several collaborative projects at work.<br /><br />The first thing it did for me was to help me recognize that every time we want someone to do something, we are selling. Whether it is our co-workers, neighbors or teenagers, understanding how to motivate them to make the decision we want is powerful knowledge.<br /><br />The second thing that it helped me understand was that identifying the problem was the most important step. Rushing to solve the assumed problem may not be the right course of action. Taking time to understand the problem, and asking the right questions, can help identify a more successful solution.<br /><br />Third, the book is full of examples that demonstrate the success of these techniques and illustrate that the sales paradigm has changed. The well-researched, clearly presented examples is a staple Pink's style, and this book is no exception.<br /><br />In the interest of brevity, I will close with one last point. To ensure it isn't just another book on the shelf of business books, it provides you with some very practical changes or behaviors you can undertake that will improve your sales skills.<br /><br />The book asks two key questions at the end: If the person you're selling agrees to buy, will his or her life improve? When your interaction is over, will the world be a better place than when you began?<br /><br />I think the answer to both is yes, and is ultimately why I recommend this book.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my son, so the timeliness of shipping was important. The DVD/CD set came in well before Christmas. If you are a Led Zeppelin fan you will love the London concert from 2007. It is amazing these guys can still play with the best. Jason Bonham was great filling in as drummer.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitaire is solitaire.  This one is as good as any I have used in the past.  It certainly fits the bill.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I had been looking for a suitable flash for my Nikon D200. Almost purchased an SB-600, but have been pleased with the SB-700. Having read the concerns about the battery door issus, I can say that has not been a problem for me. The flash works great and integrates well with the D200 features.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Lots of fun and challenging. I can't give much advice on how to win this game, I'm still learning it.
0375851569|4.0|Some of the better books from this great and fun author are included in this collection. I have some personal favorites that didn't get included, but still a good solid set.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|My daughter loves anything challenging, especially puzzles (she can solve the Rubik's Cube in less than 2 minutes).  This is very fun and maybe a bit too challenging for her .
1904550665|4.0|This is a good action song for kids and the CD helps a lot if you want to sing along with music.
1419705849|5.0|This is the latest book in the &#34;Diary&#34; series and my daughter loves them all.  She read the entiere book in less than a day.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|Great movie and a great addition to our Christmas movie line up. Will Ferrell is perfect in this role and it's a great one to watch again and again.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Amazing, great story line it was great on the mind tricks and the graphics I would totally recommend this game to anyone
B007V4LKRU|5.0|If you think Rush hasn't made a decent record since the 70's....think again!!<br /><br />Neil Peart, Geddy Lee, and Alex Lifeson have outdone themselves with their epic 19th studio album.  The Garden is the most beautiful song ever written. Period.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|it's really neat, and I love when you get to go out in the wild and see wild animals to. The graphics are equally cool. :)
B001NE80P4|5.0|great gift for my 10 year old, got her all three movies from amazon. would reccomend for same age girls
B0086700CM|4.0|I absolutely love this app. It doesn't require internet to play (the store does though) The only reason I'm rating it four stars is because sometimes the tilting doesn't work on the kindle fire.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I REALLY ENJOY NELSON DeMILLE'S BOOKS. HE MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE IN IT WITH THE LEAD CHARACTERS. HE MAKES YOU LAUGH OUT LOUD AT THE ODDEST THINGS WITH HIS FUNNY ANIDOTES! I ALWAYS LOOK FOWARD TO HIS NEXT BOOK.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great and easy read. I didn't want to stop reading!! This book has it all-it made me scared, laugh, and cry!!
B008K8U13K|1.0|Wow, I really wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this game.  I've tried 4 times now to download this to my Kindle Fire with no success.  I will be requesting a refund from amazon!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book, it was so emotional, and I could connect with it. I can't wait to see how different the movie is though! Love love love<3. P.S. I hate reading...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Let me first say that this book is amazing. The author, Collen Hoover, is an amazing storyteller and you will experience every emotion of the characters. The book does have heavy content matter but it is real stuff that does happen everyday and probably to someone you know. This book will have you guessing right until the very end! I don't want to give any details away so I am  going to leave it at that.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|An absolute marvel. This book kept me captivate the entire time. This nail biting, page turning thriller leaves me begging Miss Meyer for more.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I can't believe such a good book such as Les Miserables is for free. Good and recommended for all. Brilliant and Fantastic
0060873175|4.0|To all you negative people, keep in mind that Crichton was writing this book when he was really sick in the last part of his life.  It took another person to finish writing the book in order to get us the final work Mr. Crichton had to offer us.  I have been reading Crichton's books since I could read.  The Great Train Robber was one of the first novels I read.  While \\"Micro\\" is certainly not up to the standards we are used to reading, it is certainly worth reading the final Crichton book.<br /><br />The characters are not described as well as we are use to seeing.  The story seems a bit disjointed at times.  Without giving away too much plot, it is often difficult to tell what size ratios we are suppose to be imagining (you'll understand when you read the book).  All that aside, I after getting past the first few chapters I found myself enjoying the book a great deal.  I only wish Crichton could have finished the book himself as I think it would have been one of his best.  If you enjoyed the book \\"Prey\\", you'll likely enjoy this book.  While it is certainly a completely different story it is similar enough that you should like it.<br /><br />I'd like to say more about the book but it would give away the plot line and I don't want to do that.  I suggest pushing through it especially if you are a Crichton fan.  Baring a miracle of finding a near completed manuscript in Crichton's desk, this is probably the last you'll read from him.  I for one will miss him greatly and I think that Preston does a nice enough job of giving us a book we can enjoy and get that last little bit of Crichton in our life.
B005P3NPXG|5.0|Soul 1 was great but Soul 2 is even better. Seals rendition of Love TKO would make Teddy Pendergast proud.
B001V7SME2|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I am looking for the original one in the original language with english sub-titles. I have the re-done version in english (DVD). The American made version (Let Me In) although it's a lot more dramatic and the dialogue is re-done, I still like this one the best.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|At first, this game seems easy, but the levels become more difficult as the grids increase in size. The game also comes with enough grids for hours of fun. CAUTION: the game is addictive and you won't want to stop playing. Seek help if this occurs or turn the app off.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Just awesome. In my opinion, a must own trilogy for all batman and action movie fans. The quality is superb.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is fun for everyone and easy enough for kids!  You click on the oven and you can make food for the customers. You can make all kinds of food but when you have no food left on the table,the customers get mad and leave. Also when there are no seats left the same thing happens. You can buy more tables and chairs for your restaurant. You also can expand it to make more room for tables and chairs. You run out of food after a while.  It's a fun game!
B0049J0CTM|5.0|I rented this movie for my daughter to watch in the car. Best decision ever! This is a fantastic movie for children and adults. I have seen it numerous times and get caught up in it every time. My daughter is just getting to the age that she can enjoy movies and she clearly enjoyed this one!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great book would definitely recommend it to everyone who love hunger games<br />You should have a lot of fun reading it.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|It's fantastic that Rick remains dedicated to his group. He could have so easily given up on Maggie and Glenn, but literally slipping into enemy territory and facing certain death wasn't enough to keep him or Daryl and Oscar away. He's done a good job proving his leadership ability and even giving Daryl some focus when the prospect of Merle came up.<br /><br />That said, Rick is still stuck with some emotional issues. I had thought that it had been a quick fix after his phone revelation, but seeing Shane was not a good sign that things are back in order. It was a nice surprise I wasn't expecting, but I can't wait to see how long until Rick breaks again.<br /><br />And did anyone think Shane looked like Wolverine with that haircut and beard?<br /><br />I did enjoy the gun fight, although I though Glenn and Maggie's rescue seemed a little easily done. Yet, it was certainly interesting that the two sides really didn't get a chance to meet and spent more time anonymously apart and firing bullets.<br /><br />It really makes me want to see a personal standoff between Rick and the Governor even more. Except I have a feeling that the Governor Rick will be forced to face down the road will be nothing short of pure evil.
B009X2CVXA|5.0|i really like all of Kate Mortons books, they are set in the past but with the working out of the present. great read, she is one of the authors that when i read her books i cant put them down.

B004EYT932|2.0|Like many academic books it states the conclusion in the forward and takes another 200-300 pages to go into excruciating detail to prove the conclusions (which are not earth shattering) that it stated at the start of the book.  At best it should be scanned.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I really liked it and I think it should be. five star and even my sister loves it like me.
0316227706|5.0|My wife and I saw this book in the store and thought it was great.  I bought it as a Christmas gift for my wife on Amazon, where it is less expensive.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|As an atheist, this book further solidified my understanding of the world, but at the same time exposed me to different questions and ways of thinking I had previously not even fathomed. Regardless of religious beliefs, this book opens one's eyes to another way of thinking, whether you agree with it or not. I highly recommend this book.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Fantastic,this tv series is great I love it very much.I recomended to everyone who likes tv series.Service very fast. Ok
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book! Great Suspense! I could not put the book down. I am not an avid reader, but a friend recommended this to me, and I would highly recommend it.
B002W2U3H4|5.0|I've always loved this movie, and it was even better in HD! Wonderful message about Christmas and believing and the cast did a good job!
B000E1MXSW|5.0|One of my favorite movies. It's great to have the uncut version and not have to rely on catching it on TV.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it is a very fun, puzzling, confusing, game. Even thoe it is very confusing I would recamend this for all ages.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I totally loved it! It was the best book I have read in a very very long time. I can't wait for the movie!
B004PYWRQC|5.0|This movie keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat and I did not see the ending coming! I think this is Depp's best movie ever!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|So much fun and the space graphics are great.  My 4 year old loves angry birds and always wants to try the new games, he was very pleased.
B009IAN56E|5.0|If you liked Wings and DNA you will love the CD. All of the songs are really good. There is definitely potential for a few more singles in there.
B00A757EFW|3.0|I loved pacman as a kid.  I picked the game for my son to play.  The screen did not easily recognize the movements which made it difficult to play.  He was not pleased and wanted to go back to angry birds.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Brilliant piece of software. Quick and easy to install on both PC and Tablet/Phone. Had it up and running in less than 5 minutes. Had everything from my PC working on both my Tablet and Phone. This would be one of the best apps I have installed this year.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|My wife and sisters dragged me to this movie despite my best efforts and I found myself laughing out loud.  Clever, funny, and worth the purchase of the DVD.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote simply works perfectly across my tablet, phone and PC.<br /><br />The sync feature is outstanding.<br /><br />This is truly a &quot;must have&quot; app
B00AA0TJO8|2.0|I love this game and was excited to play it on my tablet but it's unresponsive and doesn't even let me draw a stickman on the first screen. It seems to not recognize that I'm trying to draw. Doesn't matter if I try to draw with the stylus or my finger. Please fix. I rreally want to play this!!<br /><br />Gets 2 stars because it's a cool game  (it plays on my HTC EVO 4G LTE) but no more stars because of the tablet fail. Will revise Review if fixed.
B0086700CM|5.0|Thought just another game out to download out there but this one was great from the start. You never know when you make a turn what is around the corner. Totally addicting and fund
0307383415|5.0|Dreams from My Father is an autobiographical narrative of Barack Obama's life, pre-Washington, from birth to his tenure as State Senator of Illinois.<br /><br />I've heard this called a political manifesto... but it's not; rather a story of a struggling journey from boyhood to man for someone who doesn't quite fit in anywhere -- someone that is too white for the black culture of his youth, and too black for whites to embrace. It's a story of struggle, of race, and of finding ones place in world of very clear-cut rules and social norms.<br /><br />And this is a page turner if there ever was one. Not only does Obama have a story to tell, he writes it with clear and gripping prose. The narrative sucks you in early and never lets go, leaving you wanting more at the very end. And better still, with each turn of the page the reader is self-reflecting as much as they are engaging in the narrative itself.<br /><br />I don't give many five star ratings, but this book is definitely deserves one. It's a must read for everyone!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This story is a beautifully comical journey through history with some unforgettable characters fictional and real.  It reminded me of Woody Allen's \\"Zelig\\".
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|The plot line of this movie is awesome, I love sci-fi and particularly post-apocalyptic movies. But this movie was extremely unrealistic and totally predictable. It is entertaining but it was a little painful to finish. My husband watching the first 20 minutes, fell asleep, woke up for the last 10 minutes and didn't really feel like he missed much. He had no desire to watch what he missed.
0525952926|5.0|Unfortunately, Ken Follet can't write fast enough.  If you haven't read ALL his books, start today.  My only disappointment is that the final book of this trilogy isn't available yet!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Love the ease of the game, not too hard to level up... just need friends that play it, too! Graphics are simple and clean, Extra money not absolutely required to play.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is now one of my favorite books of all time. I went through pretty much every emotion while reading it. It's amazing how Colleen Hoover came up with this story. I read a lot of new/young adult books and they all seem to have somewhat similar story lines but this one is in a class all its own. I loved this book and could not put it down. Would defiantly recommend this book!
B005AVIW54|3.0|Enjoyed this book while on holiday......nice easy reading on holiday. Not exciting or gripping story but liked it nevertheless. Thanks &#34;Jordan&#34;
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I have wanted this game for a while after playing the free version. This game is amazingly fun. Get it, you won't be disappointed, pinkie swear!
B002VWNIDG|5.0|Sill one of the best scary movies around; wether you watch it at Halloween time or when your in the mood for a good scary flick. This is a great movie!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is a well put together game that is quite fun.  You might get addicted to it and just have to keep going until you finish it.  Definitely worth buying.
B008602KQI|5.0|From start to finish this movie grips you & enthralls you. It will be a movie that you will want to watch again & again. It is that good. Truly a classic!
B005KJZDW6|5.0|Whats not to love?  Even better than I thought it was gonna be!<br /><br />Perfect from start to finish....<br /><br />Fast shipping to boot...<br /><br />Thank you, Santa!
B004LSO7IS|5.0|I love this movie the story line is done very well. The acting is great and it pulls you in on an emotional level.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Just kidding. But who doesn't like her songs? They're catchy. She writes them herself, she knows how to play instruments, and she is a good role model for girls (despite her not being able to find a stable relationship.)<br /><br />My wife has had this on non-stop for the last few days. I don't mind.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|My son loves this movie, listening once a day and I am delighted to have paid saveless.... tank you and have a nice year
0439023521|5.0|one of the best books i have read you should read it. i loved it a must read book best auther ever
B003NX75B8|5.0|Im not an avid reader, but I couldnt stop reading it. Its amazing! It is innapropriate for young children, just lettin ya know
B00457WZEI|5.0|i would read it. it is one of the best books i have read a must read the book is great read it.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Very boring but useful for study. Not very accurate to get to certain pages without memorizing parts.<br /><br />Review by Lucas Carlock
1407109367|5.0|Catching Fire i one of the best books besides books one and two you should read this book now and order it
B00992CF6W|5.0|This minecraft game is awesome I love to build and have the best time on it I recommend this to people who like to build the only bad thing I have to say is that the things that your used to the computer are all the building materials this game didn't have some of them but the updates will bring them
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I downloaded this Bible app for my Kindle Fire. It looks good and moves quickly. I believe its NIV which is usually my 1st choice.  Enjoy!
B005USZYDU|1.0|In a word, awful. I'm not sure what the goal was here, but I didn't manage 3 chapters...shame Grisham, shame!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|loved the storyline and game play is awesome. only free to a certain point , then have to pay! should be told about this prior to starting game play!
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book was fun to read and kept me entertain I cannot wait to read the next one I believe it will be the same
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This was the best game that involves mystery  EVER . I can't wait to get the 2 part this was Worth the wait for the download!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|It is one of the best games I have ever played the graphics are better than most it is my favorite game on my kindle fire it's what you would expect from gameloft!
B0067TQQI8|4.0|Does everything it is supposed to do. I have an iphone5 and sometimes work late hours at work. It is great to be able to charge on the train ride home where there is no outlets available. Charges the iphone5 in about 10 or so minutes to 100% from 20% which is good enough for me.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game I really like playing it . I am very addicted to this game it's very time consuming and sometimes difficult.<br />I hope they continue making great games.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|LOVE IT!!! A friend of mine got me to check out this guy. Great music.... nice to sit and chill with.  Whole cd enjoyable, and that doesn't happen too often.  Worth the buy :)
B00AA0TJO8|1.0|It was frustrating when I couldn't activate switches until I moved around wasting time for awhile. Then when I exited the game it crashed my Samsung Charge.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can't seem to put these books down.  I'm so excited to start book 3. It's going to be great I know it.
B005LAIHPY|1.0|Not quite sure what direction they wanted to take with this movie. It was a love story/drama/action flick and all around cheesy film. The story itself doesn't come clear until about 30 minutes into the movie. By then, i was totally uninterested. Concept is simple. We (humans) beam messages into outer space. Eventually they get an answer. From there, it's pretty cut and dry. Hostile aliens, etc., etc. Even though they had some decent action and good actors like Liam Neesen, they still couldn't save this sinking ship. And Rhianna's role was laughable at best. Overall grade is D-. Rent it if you must see it. Not worth a buy. Glad i didn't see this debacle in the theaters. I would have walked out. I couldn't even finish this film. I stopped watching at the hour and half mark and fast forwarded some parts at that. I had enough of it.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|This film poses some interesting questions about the nature of our identity and its relationship to memory.  I loved that part.  The downfall of this film, as with most science fiction, is that this fundamental question of identity became lost in the science and the poor story line.  But, having said all of this, I was still intrigued.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I doubted I'd like it before I watched it. I really enjoy  British comedy but I had a preconceived notion Downton would drag and be unbearably stuffy. I was wrong! Maggie Smith is a big highlight for me and she cracks me up. The story clips along and my interest hasn't stalled out yet.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|This film is a poor imitation on the original Bourne series.  Then again, I wasn't a fan of the second or third Bourne films either.  The first film was a novel idea about a programed evil &#34;superman&#34; who discovers his powers and his goodness.  The subsequent Bourne films have been just a repetition of the first film.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game is very addictive, I absolutely love it! A definite must for anyone and everyone who likes puzzle games.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The ending was terrible. But all in all, I couldn't put it down and finished in 3 days. Worth the read for sure.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love, love and LOVE having Pinterest on my Kindle Fire!! It works like a charm, no problems! I love that I can be on Facebook (on the Kindle Fire) and see something I want to pin, and be able to do it without having to go onto my laptop or desktop! If you utilize Pinterest, then you know what it's all about...not much to review other than it's one fine app:)
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This is a pretty good game - it's quite long which is great,  and there a lot of puzzles (not just hidden object) . Looking forward to the sequel!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|This is a bit of a knock off on Fifty Shades.  A lot of smut but not much story line.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|Good album, I feel Muse has a distinctive sound. While everyone has their own favorites I feel like this is their best album.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|As a history buff of the Second World War watching history come alive on the screen is a thrill. This is one of the few historically accurate movies that you will see. The actors bring the real life characters, that they portray, to life. If you like history and action then you should have this movie in your library.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My 6 year old enjoys this game.  It's not too difficult for him.  He knew what to do immediately and can figure out each new section on his own.
0425252868|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  The story was told in a way that it seemed to be a work of historical fiction - the reward was that it was real.  As a retired Air Force aviator, the level of detail regarding the technical aspects was just enough ... but the part I couldn't have imagined was the description of character, courage, and camaraderie on the part of two enemies.<br /><br />Very human and heart warming.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|It was great watching all three movies in succession.  A great review to understand the terrific finish of the series.  It's obvious they're leaving it open to sequals!
B00AE2LJVS|2.0|About the only thing really enjoyable for me in this movie was the setting.  Otherwise it didn't appeal to me very much.  Lots of mumbling and far fetched story lines.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I haven't been so bored to tears reading a book<br />I haven't been so bored to tears reading a book<br />I haven't been so bored to tears reading a book<br />Need I say more?
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I loved it but it took forever to download I had the apple free version way better with more characters but n&egrave;eds a few more loved all the tools two thumbs up!!:)
B005LLSNNE|5.0|The streaming video through our PS3 worked great to watch Sons of Anarchy - at the time, we couldn't get it through our Netflix subscription.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I finished the book in one day because I could not put it down.  It had twist and turns and I was blown away!  I loved Slammed and Point of Retreat, but Hopeless was the best. I highly recommend it!
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I signed up for it and then the madness began.  I put in my password and was told it did not match my email address.  I was asked for my password at least 25 times in an attempt to correct it.  I decided to try again from the beginning and as i patiently began the process all over again, at long last I was told that someone else had that email and account (really?).  I thought it did not match.  I tried again to get into the account but again, I could not.  I really wanted to get the bible because I could use it while I'm on Facebook and share scriptures. However, just joining is a 'pain.'  Perhaps they can be of more help and not make getting an on-line bible such a problem.  I had to rate it 'I hate it' because joining should not be like getting into a bank vault.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game. it is highly addictive. the dragons are super cute also and easy to breed for new ones
B0006HBZXS|5.0|I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH.  IT WAS VERY ENJOYABLE AND EVEN TAUGHT A LESSON IN HOW TO ACT IN MOST SITUATIONS.  ANTHONY HOPKINS PLAYED A MAN WHO WAS RICH BUT WHO HAD PERSONALITY AND CLASS.  I DECIDED TO TAKE SOME OF HIS BEST QUALITIES AND TRY TO BE A BETTER PERSON MYSELF.  HE SHOWED SO MUCH CLASS AND BEAUTY THAT EVEN THOUGH I HAD SEEN IT TWICE PRIOR, I CRIED AGAIN WHEN I SAW IT THIS LAST TIME.  IT IS A GREAT MOVIE.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Absolutely love this album and super glad I got it for the Kindle Fire at such a steal of a price!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Gives the horse world a new twist, also it show`s how with the right owner anything is possible if you believe!!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|My two boys and hubs are in love with this game...so I consider it worth the price for them to be happy!
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I have seen this film a number of times in the past year, and on my first run, I admit that I was a bit confused at first.<br /><br />But, after a few viewings, I caught onto the whole time-loop thing and the whole idea of how Donnie's schizophrenic visions that seems to be a communication from the future into the present/past and a breathtaking choice that Donnie had made in the end. That really made one think about the interesting concept of an alternate reality or \\"time line\\" and how it affects our choices.<br /><br />The Director's Cut version, in my opinion, is a lot better than the theatrical version due its wonderful editing and also includes some \\"pages\\" from the time-travel book entitled \\"The Philosophy of Time Travel.\\"<br /><br />It even includes one of my all-time favorite songs: \\"Mad World\\" by Gary Jules.
B00881VLCE|4.0|The puzzle selections are good, the opportunity to pick the number of puzzle pieces makes this handy for children through adults to all do the same scenes and while the music is pleasant it does become boring after a few minutes.  Overall this was a good app to pick.
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|It leaves pieces all over, but my kids love to play with it.  It's the physical copy of the popular electronic game.
B007THA4FI|4.0|This book kept me hooked and had many subtleties that were hilarious and/or thought-provoking.  I enjoyed seeing another side of Rowling and think she pulled this off very well.
B00127RAJY|4.0|A good simple workout that does not require running all over the living room like Tae Bo. Simple and effective.
B005LAIGLE|4.0|Mark Wahlberg is great as always! There's plenty of action but there are a few times where the story seems to stall. Overall it's a great movie and I wasn't disappointed.
159514188X|5.0|This is a great book....the title suggests deep thinking as to what the reasons are...she's still reading this one but so far it has her busy!
B005LAIGW8|2.0|This one lacked the spirit of the first one. Poor dialog from start to finish (a.k.a. poorly written) and the directing was lacking. What a shame, this had potential to be a great franchise. Grandkids didn't even like it. Borrow a copy from someone before you buy it, you'll be glad you did.
B0059XTUVI|4.0|You have to be a real fan of history to enjoy how the story of Margaret Thatcher played out.  But there is no question that Meryl Streep just disappears inside the makeup and costumes to not only take over the role but become Margaret.  I'm a fan of Meryl but I keep being amazed at how good she really is and this movie will reward you with someone at the top of their art.
B004LWZW7E|5.0|I love Sci-Fi and I wasn't disappointed with this one! Justine Timberlake was impressive in this role and pulled it off perfectly. Great storyline and a movie worth adding to your collection.
