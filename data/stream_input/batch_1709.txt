B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I first got this app for use in genealogy research, but use it for everything. Latest use is to track ideas for Christmas gifts. I have this loaded on my home computer, my kindle and my phone. It syncs up perfectly so i have the most recent notes where ever i am.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|constant things to do. it is deffinatly worth the game... it takes time to get good money but when you do get It.....it makes it worth it.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|it was packaged up nicely, it came in no time and it was the best animated Batman film i have ever seen.
B004TSXUWY|4.0|Looking forward to reading more....good sense of unease making  the reader drawn to the story. A good start so far.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I really enjoyed the first book in this series, finding the author's use of humor and mythology as wonderful compliments.  Having read the following books, which I also recommend though I enjoyed this book the most, I feel he has created a wonderfully diverse world, where every deity is welcome (except Thor).  As other reviews have noted, the dog really is one of the best characters I have come across in a long time, and he really makes this story click.<br />This book was a quick read as I couldn't put it down except when I was laughing too hard.  I'm glad I gave this series a try.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I have been looking for an alarm click for my Kindle Fire for awhile now. I wanted one that would remain on al night and not allow the Fire to go into sleep mode. I mean really what good is a click that you cant see?  I have paid for several that claimed to work and then didn't. &quot;My Alarm Clock&quot; does everything it claims to do. my only complaint and us mostly a who cares; I wish the weather information was in larger print.
B0096PAA6E|4.0|This album is an introduction to Gary Clark Jr.  I like this first album simply because Gary is letting us know what he listens to and the range at which he is willing to go musically. The album feels like it is all over the place.  But that is to easy of a charge to make against this artist. If this was his third or forth outing then I would agree with the assessment some have made. I have wondered what type of artist he would be and as you listen to the tracks on this album, he has touched on rock, blues, pop and rnb.  Put it on and let it play I say.  I used to make off the cuff judgments about music, but over the years I have learned to let it marinate.  I like it and for me its a 4 star intro, simply because he shows us the many possibilities going forward.
B007FU1OH6|5.0|I fell upon a Zafon novel by accident and couldn't wait to read his other creations.  I have not been disappointed by any of his books and Prisoner of Heaven follows suit.  My love of Spain also makes reading these novels a pure pleasure.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I loved this book.  I could relate to what Cheryl went through as I followed a similar path when my mother died. Really touch a chord with me.
B000002BBY|5.0|I don't know how I made it through high school without ever becoming obsessed with these guys, but I suppose it's better late than never.<br /><br />This CD is worth buying for \\"Wonderwall\\" or \\"Champagne Supernova\\" alone, but it's good all the way around. Great group.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|if u like to play temple run just a little you would love this game it 1 millon times berter
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is challenging.  Coordination and fast motion are key.  My grandsons have mastered the game.  I am still working on it and having fun at the same time.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I can't get into this story.  J.K. introduces too many characters at the beginning and I can't keep track of them all. She goes off on tangets about someone and then returns to the story line.  I find it confusing and hard to follow.  Not impressed. Would not recommend it.
B000HL09MG|1.0|terrible!!  boring as hell. baaaaaad choice. wasted our time. we heard someone mentioned it and said it was a mind opener. trust me that is a mind closer, if you know what i mean. i prefer much more eventful mind opener movies.
B007MAETA8|5.0|Continuum has been my favorite John Mayer CD, until I heard this one. There's a maturity here in his voice, his lyrics, and his music. I love the vibe, which is mellow but not sleepy. Beautiful from beginning to end. A CD I will never tire of hearing.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I play this on my kindle fire and love it! Good level options and the graphics are good too. Wouldn't suggest it for a phone though.
0760316414|3.0|Ok, so I bought this book to be able to learn how to draw and sketch cars. It only covers about 3 sections on how to draw a car and that's about it. The rest of the book goes into detail about different car designers, how they think on when they are designing a car and towards the end it gets into actually how to draw the cars. The book is nice in material and has a very nice weight to it and the pictures are also printed nicely.<br /><br />This book is good if you want to learn about the thought of designing, but not a how to draw cars book.<br /><br />I was hoping for more details on parts of the body of the vehicles and the terminology when drawing the vehicles, more explanations on what parts do, and also on how to draw it in detail and not just in sketch mode.<br /><br />All in all, the book is designed well, looks good, has good information on the designing thought behind the designers of some of the cars we see on the road today and it has a directory on the back with several schools one can go to for learning to design vehicles and also all of the different car companies.<br /><br />Not a bad read, but not a how to learn to draw cars book.
0345803485|5.0|although i had no intentions of reading this book a friend told me that it was not what i thought it was<br />it is a very good story and you become so wrapped up in the characters of ana and christan<br />i read the book in 2 days and borrowed the other 2 fifty shades of darker and fifty shades of freeded and completed it in less than a week<br />as i belong to a book club with members in their 60's, 70,s, 80,s and 90,s<br /> we have picked the other 2 for our meeting this month.<br />needless to say we really enjoyed it.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|The best movie i have enjoyed in some time. It wont be a big hit with the younger generation, but it hits the spot for the older generation.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I believe anyone and everyone can benefit and find comfort in this one.  There should be a copy in every home.<br /><br />C., Georgia
B00821OUT6|5.0|This show is completely original.<br />Your at the edge of your seat<br />throughout and can't wait<br />until the next season.<br />If you love scifi or just<br />really good writing I would recommend<br />this series.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A refreshing evolution from the young poor hungry genius lawyers of Grisham's past.  Well done and very easy to read, just as we've come to expect.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I am 43 years old and IF am just now reading this book. I have seen the movie many times through out my life and so has my husband. We purchased the movie for our son a couple years ago. Being Autistic it is one of his many obsessions so once again I am enjoyed the movie, but finely decided to read the classic book it was based on.<br /><br />I will always love the movie with their love able characters, but like many movies adapted from books they did not get the whole story told and changed things about no dought to please more modern viewers and to cramp the movie into a couple hours or less.  There book was such an adventure and joy to read. I only wish I would have read it when I was young. I encourage you to challenge your kids to read the classic book first written. They will be amazed. Some Historians do claim it to be a monetary ale gory but the author never really specified this. He was a young writer at the time and my guess is he just had a great imagination, but who knows. No matter what it was meant to be, it is a good story.<br /><br />There are some parts that kids less than junior high might find gruesome, so as a parent you will want to read it first, but it is a very good book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the big numbers on it. It saves your previous calculations. And it looks great on my Kindle. I highly recommend it.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I have just started this book and can't put it down. I am sure I will love it. Any Cornwell book has been a page turner for me.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|Prometheus turns out to be what it has long been billed as -- a prequel (the origins of the Aliens and Space Travelers are revealed).  But don't let that one word description fool you, because this movie is much more.  It has deep  undercurrents that sweep you into the beginnings of mankind.  The age old questions of \\"Who are we?\\", \\"Where did we come from?\\" and \\"Why are we here\\", drives this technical marvel along at breakneck speed as it opens Pandora's box to find more unanswered questions than we had before the journey began.  Truly a cinematic spectacle, it is more of a cerebral arheological dig than another monster movie.  Monsters it has, but in this case the most menacing are \\"monsters of the mind\\"!
B004XS97KO|5.0|Though I really like all of the Doctor Who episodes, this is my favorite so far. Love the interaction between The Doctor and River.
B0034KZE9U|3.0|I use these for restaurant work where walking 8+ hours and slippery floors are common. These are honestly the best shoes I've tried for this line of work. They're lightweight and comfortable while able to handle any spill I've encountered.<br /><br />If not for the short durability, I would have given these 5 stars.<br /><br />The sole (bottom of shoe) on the right heel has come off almost entirely. It's only hanging on by about an inch of adhesion. I can also see the soles beginning to separate at the edges everywhere else. As of now they are unusable because of this as I have to alter my gait and/or be without the sole entirely.<br /><br />This began happening 7 months in with only 30 hours a week put on these shoes. Not exactly a workhorse of a shoe.<br /><br />OT: I'm going to see if I can reattach the soles with an adhesive meant for this type of repair (Shoe Goo).
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I couldn't help but feel as though many of the characters' actions were rather uncharacteristic. It seemed as though the only people who hadn't suddenly changed the majority of their motivations and opinions were the supporting cast and a few others.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I liked the book very much. It just seemed full of doppelgangers who look, talk, and sound the same yet act differently.
B000056BB3|5.0|Have the tissue ready if you're a dog lover!  What a fantastic family film...about the bond between a yong boy and his dog Skipper (Skip).  You watch the entire cast \\"growing up\\" in love, family and friendship.  The cast is superb and the movie is a must for the entire family.  If you don't shed a tear, you may be heartless.  This one got me good.
B007HU7NBK|4.0|I haven't finished this book and am not a fan of Duran Duran, but I got this book because I enjoy celebrity autobiographies. It is interesting, but would definitely be more appealing to a hardcore fan because of the inclusion of details about the band's development.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app should be awesome and fast considering how huge fb is. There is no excuse for the constant connection loss pages when I have full bars, whether it be service or wifi. And the widget that comes with it sometimes takes days to refresh since there isnt a refresh button. Even restarting my phone doesn't refresh it. Needs a whole lot of work to be a decent app.
B008Y1YFNU|3.0|Papa Roach is not my favorite band, but I like a lot and own Infest, Love Hate Tragedy and Getting Away With Murder. My brother bought this CD and I'm giving it a second spin as I write this. The main thing that I can't stand is the club/rave music direction, It's very unappealing for a fan of their classic sound as myself, this just don't mix well, furtunately half of the songs sound like the Papa Roach we all know and love. It's a very messy thing, but the good stuff is right there hidden in a pile of weirdness.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|Entertaining and fun but program has kinks. The tiles will spin when tapped but not switch places. and once it soins will not stop for the remainder of the game. V. annoying.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Not bad for this type of upgraded B type movie. I found it entertaining and overall enjoyable.  Reminded me of the Saturaday afternoon movies for a $1.00.  Just chill out and enjoy.
B008OOYALE|4.0|It's a good way to kill time. The graphics are better than most of the TeamLava games I've played. And it's not so reliant on gold so you're not forced to buy it with real money to get the stuff you want compared to the others. The only downsides would be how slow it can get and it freezes from time to time.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I like this product but I had to reinstall it because it wouldn't download anymore but it that happens just reinstall it
B008F5YDRI|5.0|Beautifully acted love story laced with gentle social commentary about government and media. 2 leads have great chemistry.Supporting cast is also very good. Fine editing and directing, too. A lovely romantic movie.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|ok ahem THIS IS THE BEST APP EVER I LOVE IT U CAN BUILD FLY ING CRAP FLYING CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  LOVE IT IT IS TOTTALY AWESOME FACE MUST BUY A++++++++++++++++
B009AMAKJU|5.0|First off, the acting in this movie was fantastic!  I thought each and every character was so realistic.  As a side note, Emma Watson did wonderful detaching herself from the Harry Potter persona.<br /><br />This story was.. amazing.  You really felt a connection with each character and everything that was going on.  The main character, for me, was easy to relate to - not personally, but I could pick him out of the crowd from my own High School years.  And with that, it was so interesting to see from that point of view.<br /><br />This entire movie made me grin, laugh, and cry.  I felt so attached to the whole thing from the beginning.  Heck, even just from the trailer.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Chose this because I just saw the movie, here in the book it really made the characters come to life ,the depth of the feelings are more defined and because of seeing the movie made it so much better .very well done a must read
0439023513|4.0|I saw another reviewer who said they were \\"torn\\" about this book.  I'd have to agree.  I absolutely loved the story and the idea behind the plot of this whole series.  I thought it was very creative.  I also really liked that Katniss isn't your typical heroin.  She's rather bland and forward, unlike many characters.  I thought she was unique!<br /><br />However, after saying that, I thought the author of this whole series hasn't reached the fantastic-author level yet.  Her writing is good, but it's no where near great.  This is especially apparent in the end of this book.  I won't give anything away, but after the big ending she just kind of rambles and trails on and on and on.  I felt like after that point, I was just waiting for it to end!  She could have done SO much better.  I was very bored with it.<br /><br />I do recommend the series to people, because the series was pretty good to read, it's just not the best thing I have ever read.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|very addicting. good and challenging match 3 game. I really like Playrix games. I wish they would adapt more of them for Android.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|My boyfriend came home with this movie one day as a surprise.  I hadn't really cared to watch it because the trailer made it look just so-so.  Turns out, the trailer and my guess were right.  Of course the acting was good, Johnny Depp and Helen Bonham Carter are always great - especially together - and that new witch lady that hasn't been in much else was good.<br /><br />The plot, however, was just average.  The comedy was also just average - I was expecting to laugh a lot more than I did.  The love story?  Below average.  I wasn't feeling the connection at all.<br /><br />If it were up to me, I'd spend about $5 on this movie, and not a penny more.  It's a decent one time watch if you're bored.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|There are very few books that utterly captivate me all the way through and I must say that this is one of them! Thank you so much Suzanne for this rare gem of creative writing...and to those contemplating purchasing this and the sequels: BUY THEM; trust me when I say that you won't regret it!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|As usual Ken Folett is the man. Nobody writes like this guy.I am looking foward to reading the final of this trilogy That says it all  ,congrats Ken. Dave Walsh

B004J4WNL2|5.0|If you're an introvert, you must read this book. You will no longer feel like you have to try to be an extrovert.  You will no longer feel like you're a second class citizen.  You'll realize that you have capabilities that extroverts don't have.  I've never felt so empowered!
B001BIJNOE|4.0|This one along with Rock N' Roll Animal may be some of his best material. Lou Reed has one of the best guitarists with him it would be hard to imagine his giving a better performance than what is found on these two album's. Hi live performances to me at times seem quite laid back. Not so here.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest website on mobile devices BLOWS. This totally solved all the issues I had while using the web version of pinterest on my Fire: no weird floaty pins that refuse to be liked or repinned, no freezing and the like and repin buttons actually act right. Love. So many more hours of my life will now be given to Pinterest!
B00138D27Q|4.0|A good product is more than the sum of its parts. That means not only having the right elements, but it is they way they function together and interact with one another. This is the case on this album and a couple of others and sets it up above many others of the day. Reed is no doubt a skilled song smith Perfect Day a good example yet the studio muscians, production team when they have all things together as you have here makes this perhaps his best studio album. Some may feel you need the best skills the greatest voice, the best guitarist that very rarely produces a great album.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game! It makes you think hard and Its fun! I would definitely recommend this fun and awesome game. :)
B0094FWHIA|5.0|It was great fun to read.  We especially liked the apple tree bumping at the end, the perfect job for Mr Bump!
B004IK9SQ0|4.0|I have had the hard cover of this book for over 15 years and only read it when the Kindle version came out. The principles in this book are timeless even if you don't share a belief system with Dr. Holmes. With the heavy media conditioning everyone faces, instructions on how to get back to a fundamental place in your thinking is imperative.
B0087HT36U|4.0|I am a hard person to please when it comes to games i have every system that has hit the market and am not so big on games on my tab but this game was fun to play not just once but over and over. can you please make more Levels. thank you.

B000FBJG04|5.0|Extremely well written, vivid details of one of the most storied units of the WW2. The first hand quotes from those soldiers that were there is a fine touch to the story.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is the best solitaire game I've found for a phone. I don't mind the ads between games, but sometimes they throw in a video ad that has sound even if you've turned off all game sounds. There's no media volume to control until the video starts, and sometimes trying to back out of it doesn't work. That's my gripe... Wah Wah Wah!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this, didn't intend for it to become a study tool, but nothing drowns out noise and help to focus like it. Five stars!
0140143505|3.0|Quite an interesting little (96 page) read, starting in 1949 with the author's first letter to a London antiquarian bookseller. From the very first, her personality shines out in her informal writing style. Meanwhile Marks & Co respond in more business-like terms.<br />Gradually the formality breaks down. Ms Hanff takes the initiative when she begins a letter 'Sir (It feels witless to keep writing \\"Gentlemen\\" when the same solitary soul is obviously taking care of everything for me)' and concludes 'I'm sending it c/o you, FPD, whoever you are.'<br />FPD identifies himself as Frank Doel; Ms Hanff sends the team a Christmas hamper; junior staff members write to thank her; they exchange details on their respective lives and Ms Hanff writes about the books she's reading. 20 years roll by...
B005PWPUW6|3.0|The build quality of this DAC seems pretty good.  Unfortunately my LCD tv,(Sylvania LC320SS9 A), doesn't have a audio setting to switch to PCM and I couldn't get it to work. I was trying to use the digital audio coax from my tv to the DAC. I receive digital tv via an antenna. I tried switching the sources. I would get signal lock on every source but the antenna.  This is probably a good product but my tv doesn't work with it.

B008CJ0KJ2|5.0|FAQ:<br /><br />Does it come with a Digital Download? Yes - Sort Of. It includes a full CD in a white paper sleeve. Rip the CD to your iTunes, play it in your car, it's yours. Just don't be an a-hole and sell the CD on amazon as \\"used, case missing\\". :)<br /><br />Is it 180 gram?  I don't think so, it doesn't come labeled as such. However, the LP record does feel substantial and there is very warm bass response.<br /><br />Overall, is it worth buying the Vinyl over CD or MP3?  Well, if you appreciate the warmth of vinyl, especially for acoustic based music like this, then, yes, get it. The included CD ensures a full access to the music from all your listening environments: HiFi, iPod, Car, phone, etc.<br /><br />But how is the music? The music itself is excellent. Compared to albums like \\"Black Light\\", this is a very accessible collection of songs. However, it still shouldn't be confused with pop-rock. Calexico consistently delivers the goods, and this album is no exception.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|awesome graphics.<br /> interesting story line. very addictive. I wanted to find out &quot;who did it&quot;  looking forward to the next installment.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|The book started out a little like The Count of Monte Cristo, a man falsely imprisoned and everything taken away from him.  Alas, it didn't turn into \\"A Prisoner of Fate\\" or other entertaining modernized retelling.Grisham doesn't do more than give us a filled-in plot description. \\"Then he did this. And then he did that.\\"  There is no character development, and little inner thought. Even then, a description of actions could have been entertaining.  However, the major plot element comes out of nowhere and it isn't until the end that the author backtracks and in a deus ex machina moment informs us that \\"several years ago it just so happened that.  .  .  \\"  Bah humbug!!!  Given the right author, book could have been so much better!  Instead, it was an effort to keep going.
0316287059|5.0|I love this book by Kevyn Aucion what a talented artist. If you have little knowledge or are an experienced artist you can learn something from this book. I often use this book when I want to create a new look for myself or for others. You will not be disappointed. This author also has another book called Making Faces which is my other favorite makeup book.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|VERY WELL WRITTEN AND IN LAYMAN TERMS. Drags a bit with too much detail in the English history part, but skip thru it and the fascinating details of nation failure return.  A bit obvious comparison to the U.S. economy at the present time.To me, wonderful new details of African historical development, esp. Ethiopian.
B0076794IO|3.0|The plot was hard to follow at first and jumped across time frames but once I got into it and the story got going it was enjoyable.
B0092ZEIN4|3.0|I received my Nyko Playpad last week. I write game software, so this is one of several devices I'm currently testing. For the price, it's hard to beat, but it's not my favorite bluetooth controller. The included hard case is a nice touch. Here's a list of the pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Good value - price is reasonable and includes a hard case<br />2) Rechargeable battery lasts a long time<br />3) D-Pad and buttons respond well.<br />4) Supports multiple operating modes for good compatibility<br />5) Compact and light weight<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Shape and placement of controls is reasonable, but not ideal<br />2) Difficult to pair/connect via bluetooth. Some of my Android devices connect to it and others don't. Once it's connected, the connection is very reliable<br />3) Analog nubs are a bit stiff and uneven
B008BSPQ3E|5.0|I haven't had a chance yet to watch and listen everything in this box set, but so far, I am VERY HAPPY!  I watched the Live in Athens concert DVD, and it's fantastic!  Unfortunately, I was too young to see him in concert for that tour, so it's extremely exciting for me to see a full concert from that tour on DVD!  Some of the Athens footage was used in POV, but there's a lot that was not on POV, like the Family and the Fishing Net and Intruder. The Live in Athens CDs are also included and they are fantastic...it has the most haunting version of Mercy Street I've ever heard, my now favorite version of Don't Give Up, and the Family and the Fishing Net and Family Snapshot are really great too.  I've always loved that version of No Self Control too, from watching it on POV.  The sound is very impressive on the live CDs.  I'm loving the DNA CD so far too!  What can I say?  It's all good!!!<br /><br />To address the complaints from other reviewers:  I haven't had any problems with quality (no signs of the scratches or glue mentioned by another reviewer), but I ordered directly from the WOMAD shop, not Amazon, so maybe that makes a difference.  Perhaps if you're worried, you can order from WOMAD?  It is more expensive though.  I agree that it would have been cool to have some of the B-sides on CD, but since I have most of those on vinyl, I guess I'm not that upset.<br /><br />To sum up, if you are a Peter Gabriel fan, this is a MUST HAVE!
0143121421|4.0|This might be one of the best spy novels of all time, at its admirers say.  I wouldn't know.  I haven't ready many spy novels, and this 1963 work was my first exposure to le Carré's writing.  I wouldn't mind reading more, though after reading the autho's own 1989 introduction to this novel, I feel somehow warned against it.  The Spy Who Came In from the Cold tells the story of Alec Leamas, a British intelligence agent who, after seeing his best East German source shot dead at the Berlin border-crossing checkpoint, becomes part of a plan to frame, discredit, or perhaps even kill Mundt, a high-ranking official in the East German intelligence agency who is held responsible in the West for the death of capture of multiple Western agents, and the general disruption of intelligence gathering.  Or at least, that is apparently what is going on, but because this is a novel about the world of espionage, deceit, and secrets, you can never be sure.  The book is an effective page-turner, but it is more than that.  Le Carré has much more depth than, say, a Grisham or similar writer of page-turning, plot-driven novels, and he is a better writer.<br /><br />Though this novel takes place during the Cold War, there is little about ideology, and most of what there is comes off as cynical.  Indeed, there is little to distinguish the players on either side of the ideological divide.  This is in large part because, as Leamas himself points out, the battle is fought at close quarters, at the scale of the individual, and individuals on either said may be honorable or despicable, cowardly or brave, bought or sold.  Part of le Carré's skill is that he effectively portrays the weariness and cynicism of the practice of espionage without suggesting that it should all be tossed out the window.  It does make one wonder: even with all the advances in electronic intelligence gathering, can anything really replace good old-fashioned human beings?
0316228532|1.0|I bought kindle edition on my tablet because I have been travelling a bit and thought to enjoy JKR's new masterpiece during one of the flights! Haven't seen these many F*** and curse words in One Book, probably, 20% of all words are such!<br /><br />Apart from introducing readers to innovative ways of using curse words by the mouth of teen agers, I don't see any noticeable thing! But, yes...some occurrences of Authentic vs. Unauthentic. A Landmark Forum Mantra, as I take it. Have been to one of the 4-day session and Authentic vs. Unauthentic dribble was one of the things which did not impress me. Overall Landmark Forum has some good things in it. I was, however, disappointed, that JKR will borrow the idea.<br /><br />In short, this book is a Grand Disappointment. After Harry Potter's, which I read 70-80 books (70-80 times), Casual Vacancy is an advertisement of self-inflicted failure! I hope she will redeem herself by writing a longer Epilogue of Deathly Hollows, more than 19 pages!! There is a lot JKR can write on the aftermath of Lord Voldermot's downing by the hands of Harry Potter! Ministry Politics, purging of Death Eaters, magical pictures of DA and Order on Harry's Drawing Room walls! A lot could be written.<br /><br />Only another Harry Potter book can dilute the bad taste created by Casual Vacancy. A more than \\"Casual\\" effort is required to regain lost footing!
B00992CF6W|1.0|his game is fine unroll you lose all of your progress. So for a seven dollar game it wouldn't do that now I want my money back! oh and this game is now BS!!!!!
B000002TQV|5.0|In my listening experience, The Bends is everything as enjoyable as OK Computer is. Both are great rock albums, with everyone in the band really delivering quality music. Thom Yorke delivers clean cut, strong, yet unique vocals. It's consistent throughout the whole album, but really shines in Fake Plastic Trees. The guitarists deliver great riffs while not overdrowning the singing. Some of the most enjoyable electric guitar moments can be found in My Iron Lung and The Bends. It's one of those albums that you just never get tired of, because of great songwriting, great composing, and great playing. Deserves a five star. A must listen for any music fan.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Nevosoft 's games are great.  Graphics are awesome, storyline was interesting...maybe a bit too long of the dialouge was a little boring and long. The game as a whole deserves a4* rating.

B003F3FJQO|5.0|once again james dashner has creaated a fast-paced novel that you really just can not put down. everything in it was creative and interesting to think about. all in all this has been an amzing trilogy so far (this being the second book).
B004C3DLJS|5.0|In the some spirit as 1 & 2, Woody and the gang did not disappoint. Faithful to the other stories and some hilarious surprises in store for this final part of the series. You will treasure the ending and it was quite a tear-jerker.
B008LSVLZG|4.0|This is truly a performance that you need to watch several times, before you can really appreciate the musicianship and song-writing. It's a concert performance of \\"Grace for Drowning\\" which again is technically and musically a very accomplished project. The difference between this and PT albums is there's not so much (but some)of the heavier edge and cranking riffs that PT do so well. I highly recommend this DVD and album... just don't expect Deadwing or In Absentia. And the final song is (sorry SW) just a little TOO dark in parts.<br />My only real beef is the use of a front stage scrim as a lighting effect for the first half hour. It mostly annoyed the hell out of me and I even fast-forwarded hoping it wasn't in place the entire concert. Once it's gone, vision is great. Sound is fantastic all the time.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I felt this story couldn't have ended in a better way. Much of the trilogy was far fetched of course, but that is what I loved about it. I feel that Suzanne Collins stayed true to her characters by not over romantisizing them, taking them through the grief process and allowing them peace in the end.
0385535147|3.0|After years of reading John Grisham books, titles blur and characters are forgotten.  But he continues to create page turning, \\"litigational\\" adventure that keeps me guessing what might come next.  Of course, it's too difficult to know if what does come next could actually happen in real life. He admits that it's all fiction. This creative freedom has given him, overall, a successful but limited range. Grisham is not a potboiler writer, yet years of adrenaline page turning don't lead one to expect that, long-term, most of his works will rise above a modest, light reading status.<br /><br />This is the case with The Racketeer. Amazon's brief, wordless video on the book's page show just how action packed, and light, the book is.  Also, the final part on \\"Nattie\\" makes me think that Grisham started there and then went back to unpack the story, creating a well-written but preconceived plot that depends heavily on planes, rental cars and intrigue.  Can one get too tired of an adrenaline adventure?  Maybe so. But I expect this of John Grisham and continue to await his new books.<br /><br />The Racketeer does contain Grisham's social consciousness raising by remanding the justice system for brutally destroying innocent lives through uncaring, unethical convictions. Malcolm Bannister's story is that of an innocent man getting even with the system. However, Malcolm isn't out to make changes; he's out for freedom and revenge. He is successful as things line up in his favor and all that could go wrong doesn't.  It is, as Grisham clearly states, \\"all fiction.\\"  Of course, Vanessa's legs also help....<br /><br />I'll await his next legal thriller, probably one that will have me enjoying the \\"lawyering\\" of it all, yet all the while I'll be loitering a bit as the book reaches its adventurous, light-reading, adrenaline, page-turning conclusion where I'm entertained, but where titles blue and characters are soon forgotten.  Hey, that's my choice, and that's what Grisham delivers.<br /><br />Oh....this is the first Grisham book I've read not by buying it or waiting for a library copy, but because someone kindly posted it free online. Is this a racket(eer) or what?/><br />Oh....this is the first Grisham book I've read not by buying it or waiting for a library copy, but because someone kindly posted it free online.

B0037VIBGY|5.0|This movie was AWESOME!! Bronson was perfect combo of violence and comedy. Must I say more. No, no I do not.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Easy to use and works every time. I like the features and snooze feature. It makes it very easy to set the time repeat.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|Johny Depp is excellent as usual but with a plot that goes nowhere and a weak supporting cast not even a decent performance by the title character can save this movie. If you saw any of the previews you have already seen all of the funny parts of the movie.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Ive read em all and luv em.  Rick Riordan has become one of my favorite authors because of the Percy Jackson series of books.  The Mark of Athena was a great addition to the series.<br /><br />Superb!
B008TMOIEK|5.0|I've always loved classical music and this album is a great example why! The music in this album goes perfectly with the book. I love putting the music on to play in the background while reading. Also, I'll put it on and listen to it all day... it makes time slip away!!!

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Ms. Day's second novel in her Crossfire series is absolutely wonderful.  It's not one you will one to put down until you get to the end.  The characters have been developed in her second novel and she has kept the story real even though Gideon may seem too good to be true.  It's a must read!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Best match-3 game I've played.  It has all the best features of Bejeweled2 &amp; Jewel Twist plus fixing the shortcomings of those games.  The addition of a story &amp; an overall 'game' to win as well as levels &amp; stages adds interest. Increasingly difficult obstacles add challenge, and learning how to make best use of the powerups is surprisingly hard.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|I am not a very avid reader and find it difficult to complete a book. I loose interest after first few chapters. However Man's search for meaning has been a different experience. After reading this book I have become self-critical of any activity that will take up a lot of my time. I now ask myself \\"is this or will this be meaningful to me?\\", and if the answer is \\"no\\", I will not do it. This book has influenced me to consciously live a meaningful life, to place a great value on the journey and not just the destination, while knowing that \\"meaningful\\" doesn't always mean \\"enjoyable\\"
030758836X|2.0|This book built into such a good addicting plot until it just ... dropped. Like another reviewer said, it's like the author didnt know what to do and just wrote it off  quickly. Dissappointing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

0307960471|5.0|Another dark ride with our friend Harry Hole. The dual narrative device works well and isn't overplayed although there were times I wished one didn't interrupt the other, but that's what made it effective in the end. I nominate Clive Owen to play Harry in the upcoming screen version of The Snowman. Any doubters should watch Owen in The International for my reasoning. Great movie. Mark Twain has an often repeated saying that applies to Harry in The Phantom. [...]
B009A3NGF4|5.0|At first listening, I was a little disappointed because \\"Sigh No More\\" was just SO GOOD. But, I kept listening and am now completely in love with this album. It's just as good - if not better - than the first. Buy it!
0062068415|2.0|Lehane had a clunker with this one and I LOVE his earlier books. The characters were so much thinner and the whole story was clicheed and the ending obvious (and I haven't seen the movie). I kept reading hoping I was wrong and it would get better but it didn't. This one made me wonder whether his other non-Kenzie-Gennaro detective books would be any good and that was a dispiriting thought.
B007TK77QE|2.0|I found the book very depressing and far too long, not what I expected at all from jk rowling. Would not rush to buy another of her books.

B006LSZECO|1.0|Not agood story. I did not finish it and would like a credit from amazon!! Does amazon read this review?
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was truly like a dream. The descriptions of the circus attractions were imaginative and sweet. The characters were engaging and charming. The story keeps you guessing what will happen next. I strongly recommend this book to anyone looking for a pleasurable diversion.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I like this book. I was so involved in the book that I was egarly waiting to know that how Katniss's  mother,sister and Gale will welcome her. Somehow due to next releases in the book series this part was not covered. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars to this book.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game has an extensive amount of levels, great graphics and is very addictive. Not one problem with the game at all on the DROID razor.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|It's so easy to use :) The only thing I would change is to be able to use it without needing wifi, then it would be perfect.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Lots of fun for all ages!  Other players are friendly and helpful!  Only drawback is that the game pace can be quite slow if a minimal amount of cash is not invested!
8866131350|4.0|I really like this planner. I usually prefer a monthly and daily format, but this works well to help me stay on top of what I would like to get done each day. I do use google calendar for everything else, so if I wasn't doing hat I wouldn't get this calendar. It's just not big enough.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|It took a couple chapters but then I was hooked. Perfect romantic hero - strong, dangerous, and tortured. Excellent leading lady - smart, self reliant, and resourceful. A interesting new take on vampires and wherewolves with just enough touches of steam punk to make it all fun. This was one I just couldn't put down.
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|I ordered this video because my favorite Doctor Who star, David Tennant, was in it.  I thought he did a great job, and I also love Colin Farrell, so it was a win, win situation.  At times I found the lighting rather dark in the movie, but it was at night, and in the dark.  The movie arrived before the date given for delivery, and I was very pleased with the seller.  If you have problems finding anything, Amazon.com is definetly the place to search and buy.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|While I whipped through 50 Shades of Grey thinking there would never be a series that drew me in like that one.  Along came Bared to You then Reflected in you, can't wait for the 3rd book.  Yes the sex scenes are good but the story is what keeps you reading.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I ordered this product for my son, even though I am as big a fan of the show as he is.  It arrived before the expected delivery date, and we were very pleased with the product, especially the behind the scene bits on the video.  If you've never watched \\"The Walking Dead\\", I urge you to do so....yes it has scary zombies, but the show is about so much more than that.  It deals with humans being thrust into a situation they or anyone else would never want to be in, and how they pull together to survive...I'm surprised the Emmy awards snubbed this show, it is worthy of any awards it picks up....OH, Amazon Rocks!
B009AMAM9S|4.0|Trying to make some movies, big movies, work is like trying to catch a whale with a rod and reel. It's not easy to do and herein lies the problem with \\"Cloud Atlas.\\"<br /><br />Here's the scoop. The viewer is taken through several stories, spanning several centuries, that show how actions at one time can effect things further in the future.<br /><br />To say this is ambitious in both concept and scope is an understatement. At a nearly three hour running time it took both the Wachowskis and Tow Twyker to direct, with four writers and a cadre of producers. There were even multiple set and costume designers. The effects budget alone could run a small country for a year. But, as much as I liked it, and as much as there was to like, it lacked emotional punch. At the end, given the content of the stories, I should have been emotionally strung out but I wasn't. In one story, a female looking android, discovers the secret that old androids are processed to feed current androids (there is a nod to \\"Soylnet Green\\") and she somehow becomes a martyr and near deity for centuries to come. I didn't feel a thing. This was true for all but possibly one of the stories.<br /><br />I haven't read the source material by Mitchell, which many seem to like a lot, so I can't comment on the faithfulness the movie shows to the book. But again, this is a sweeping epic with a lot going for it. It's a visual as well as conceptual feast. Scene after scene will burn itself in the viewer's memory. It was a bit distracting to try and peal away the makeup to see who was playing which role, and some of that makeup was pretty awful, but that's a minor quibble given everything. I will probably add it to my library upon it's Blu-Ray release, but it's just that bit short of being a truly great film. Do see it. Films of this magnitude are few and far between. Just be prepared for a mental workout and an emotional letdown.

0316228532|1.0|I wish I had been able to read the reviews before I bought this. It has taken me this long to get a third of the way thru the book and can't go on.  With the Harry Potter series, I read each one from start to finish in one sitting, I was hoping for that kind of experience again.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Another great work of art from Mr. Isaacson. I really don't think he is able to write anything less that brilliant.  He was able to show who Steve Jobs was in a very fair and balanced writing. Anyway, even if your not a Steve Jobs fan, the book is a must read just for the incredible writing. You will enjoy it.
1597801585|3.0|Bacigalupi's bleak view of a future Thailand may be intellectually engaging at first, but once it becomes clear where he is going with this idea it becomes more of a chore than a joy to read.  Besides interesting ideas, a sci-fi novel needs  interesting protagonists whose fate you care about.  However, in a place where everyone is corrupt to one degree or another and where both the just and unjust are likely to die of horribly mutating diseases at any moment, there really is nobody to root for.  For most of the book, everything that happens is bad, worse, or worst. The feeble attempt at an uplifting ending is just too little, too late--by that time, I was just glad to be done with the whole mess.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I think this is a game I can play again, but I wish there was more of a payoff at the end.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|I have always loved Breakout style games, and this is one of them. The graphics are decent, there are no permissions, and the controls work, so what is to keep you from downloading a classic?
6304712936|5.0|It was interesting and entertaining. I would recommend it. I learned a lot about the composer and his life. The acting is wonderful. There are a few long drawn out scenes that are a bit boring, but overall it was great. The historical elements were especially interesting.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Angry Birds is a fun and a decent game, but horribly overrated. It makes a good time waster for when you are at the doctor's office or on an airplane, but I know people who center their lives around it and don't play anything else. What happened to challenges, anyway? It is mostly dumb luck if you clear a tricky level. AND THE MERCHANDISE IS ENOUGH TO DRIVE ME MAD! Angry Bird band aids, plushies, gummies, cups, toothbrushes, shirts, posters, and ear buds somehow made it into my house and really increase my dislike of Angry Birds. I don't mind a Sonic poster, some special Kirby playing cars, or a Mario plush because they are all in moderation, but Rovio made sure that Angry Birds is all or nothing.

B007L6VR12|5.0|Moonrise Kingdom is a great movie. It's heartfelt and loaded with great and compelling characters. The true beauty of this film lies with its masterful direction from Wes Anderson and its strong performances from its great cast. Wes Anderson's direction is excellent. He is clearly having fun doing what he's doing because his creativeness can even be seen through the credits.(Ex. Dots appearing on the screen in rhythm to the song, company logos popping up one at a time). That's something quite frankly no other movie director does. As for the cast, Edward Norton pretty much steals the show as Scoutmaster Ward. Jason Schwartzman is hilarious as Cousin Ben. He his role is pretty minor and actually more of an extended cameo, but he steals every second of it. Bruce Willis is also very good as Captain Sharp. Taking a break from being an action hero, he shows that he has a big heart to show as well.(Not to mention hair! Was anybody else surprised by that?) Jarad Gilman and Kara Hayward(the two kids who played Sam and Suzy) are also great as well. They played their roles perfectly. I would not at all be surprised if this is the start of successful careers for the two of them. Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton and Bob Balaban nail their roles as well. Also, the film features a beautiful musical score from Alexandre Desplat. To conclude, Moonrise Kingdom is a beautiful and heartfelt motion picture that anyone can enjoy. This movie should at least be nominated for the Oscar for best picture. I personally think it should win it. Also, quite frankly, I would love it if they made a sequel.
B0031RS4UM|5.0|An excellent follow up to the first book the Killing Floor and continued to explore the person that is Jack Reacher.  Was a book that captured my imagination from the first few pages.  Found it very hard to put it down.

B005LAIHRC|5.0|Loving 80s music I had to see this. My wife, a music teacher, didn't know what to expect but loved it. The way the songs were combined and made up the story was awesome. I not a big Tom Cruise fan but I think he did a good job with his part. If you are looking to find a fun movie with some great songs from the 80s, this movie is for you!
B0041OOEJY|1.0|I can overlook the inaccurate title, as the protagonist here learns kung-fu opposed to karate in the original. At the same time, the idea behind the first one is that Karate is indeed an 'art' that has more meaning than just revenge and fighting- karate is a lifestyle that helps a kid achieve balance in his life. Blindly substituting one martial art for another for the sake of cashing in on a name seems opposed to the deeper theme of the first movie. The producers of this remake essentially tell us, 'punching, kicking, karate, kung fu... it's all the same,\\" and along with this substitution we don't see any real character growth or transformation here.<br /><br />It's might seem like Smith is phoning in his lines but I think that (more accurately) he just wasn't ready for the role. Why would anyone expect him to be? He's so little, and that really stands out throughout this entire film. Not just his height, but his emotional understanding of the issues that drive the plot. The original is more powerful in that the events, silly as they seem, are believable and have more weight. We understood that if the protagonist didn't assert himself he would continue to be an outcast. Here, I'm really not sure what the outcome of any of the events matter. Smith's character  doesn't bother to learn Chinese so I don't expect for him to immigrate and it's likely his mom will be reassigned back to the US. Any relationships are only transient so what difference does anything make and how important is any of it? It's unfortunate that the producers didn't recognize some things from the first movie wouldn't work in the second, or would just seem odd and contrived, like his 'relationship' with the Chinese girl. Should a boy who looks 8 years old have a vested romantic relationship with a girl? I don't think so, but there was a boy-girl relationship in the original so why not here? Again, very poor choice.<br /><br />The saddest part of this remake is the finale. It follows the first up toa given point and just like the first, the protagonist receives a really bad blow to the leg that should end his tournament aspirations- well, that's what happened in the original. Heck, I thought Ralph Macchio would be crippled for life. Here, Jaden seems like he simply stubbed his toe. After a similar mysterious 'magic hands' homeopathic healing from his teacher Jaden is back and literally bouncing around on the bad leg. Hopping, bouncing, running around, ducking, bobbing, weaving. He doesn't even wince when he steps on the bad leg... well, until it gets hit... AGAIN!!! Completely unnecessary. Then he's wincing and we know he's going to pull out the 'crane' or something to that effect. But here, it's not the crane- and that's where this movie seriously disappoints. I didn't NEED the crane but the storyline depends on a real simple move that a guy can do with one bad leg. The crane works because it's the only thing that would have.<br /><br />What do they do here? OK, what's the next best thing a kid with one leg would do? A perfectly timed, Pele' flip kind of thing that completely depends upon the attacker to be at a precise place at the precise moment. Even a Jedi Knight wouldn't have considered such a move, but a 12 year old who looks 8 on a bad leg, facing a taller opponent for the last point... of course, why not?<br /><br />That move, whatever they want to call it, sums up this whole move: a big flash to give Jaden an acting credit.<br /><br />Well, he's got one. Perhaps his next venture will work with his talent rather than his parents' aspirations.

0143122010|5.0|Steven Pinker has outdone himself. In this massive exploration on the subject of violence, he gives us a clear and complete analysis of the origins, history and reasons for the decline in violence. We live in the most peaceful time in human history. His grasp of the subject matter is astounding. He writes with humor and grace. He is convincing in his arguments, no matter how one feels about our current state of affairs.<br /><br />If you want to view the present objectively, what better way than to look at the past? Pinker dishes up the sometimes distasteful subject of violence in bite size morsels that we can all understand. He identifies six historical trends that have contributed to the decline of violence, one building on the other to lead us to the present. Each trend making us less and less tolerant of violence. Our 'inner demons' make us susceptible to acting violently, but our 'better angles' counterbalance that tendency by putting breaks on what he sees as 'the default state' of life in nature.<br /><br />He even tells us why history has favored peace over war: violence is a 'social dilemma' because even though it is beneficial to the aggressor it is terrible for the victim. Since we are all 'survival machines', we all, at some point in time, will be either a victim or an aggressor. He calls it a 'negative-sum game' for the parties involved and it is better to opt for peace, for cooperation.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. It is long and has a lot of detailed graphs and tables, but if you persist, it is well worth it. Reading this book to the last page is an exercise in self-control, one of the better angels that Pinker talks about. I am inclined to re-read it, just to give my better angel some extra exercise. It might spill over in other areas of my life.[[ASIN:0143122010 The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined]]
B008FPOIT6|2.0|The novel has an interesting premise, but it soon devolves into a \\"quirky for quirky's sake\\" experience.  Sloan obviously enjoyed writing the novel, but he neglected character development, plot development, etc.  The ending was especially disappointing.  Rather than work out the denouement for the various plot lines, he summarily summed them up as an after thought.
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|Since I have accept Him as my Lord and Savior. This movie was able to remind what He went through for me. How great His love is. Even when I have people who hate me, I should be thankful that I don't have to go through what Christ went through for me. Its starts at the garden where Judas betrays Him, to his trial where their is an emotional scene for me, to him carrying to the cross, to his death. I cried so much more than I cried watching the movie in theaters. I love Jesus.<br /><br />John 3:16 \\" For God so loved the world that He gave His only son so that whoever believes in Him willn't perish but have eternal life.:

B005LAIHY0|3.0|While Prometheus was not a bad movie it was deffinately not as good as I hoped it would be. Most of the action you have already seen in the preview I would rent it rather than buy it
B000PDYVVG|2.0|I think it must have been because of the supershort chapters. I would never recommend it though. This woman obviously finds herself hilarious and enlightened. I admit, I did learn some interesting things about Italian and Indonesian culture. But I have to wonder how relevant it would be for a real person traveling and not some phony seeming (just my opinion) woman who is traveling just for the sake of traveling. Of course as someone who's never written a successful book this is all easy for me to say but I do read a lot and I am telling you- don't waste your time. Ugh it is so trite and predictable and I spent most of the time rolling my eyes. As I said I did finish the book so something about it must have compelled me forward but as I write this I can't quite put my finger on it.

8866130915|1.0|Have used this product in past years.  Ordered one for 2013 and VERY disappointed.  Poorly constructed.  Would send back but already opened.  The dividing ribbon actually tore one of the pages when I tried to open.  Have already ordered something different and will pitch this one losing $14 but feel I would be miserable all next year trying to use it.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|WOW! This is epic story-telling! I do not have HBO, so I am reading the books. After reading Book 1, I got Season 1 on DVD. It really brought the story and characters to life ... amazing cast! I just finished reading Book 2 and now eagerly await Season 2 on DVD!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this was a very cool game. It reminded me of temple run, though. you basically run away from a subway person in the subway. in the beggining, all you have to do is dodge and jump and collect coins. but when your towards the middle, the trains start moving. I recommend this.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was amazing and enticing. I can't wait to read the next book. I wish you offered this book in a set not individually.

B001EYU1VO|5.0|Had a broken controller that MadCatz RMA'd quickly and repaired within a couple of weeks. They provided excellent service and communication. It's a very good controller and works very well with FSX and the realistic PMDG B737NG add on. Most reviews of all controllers, regardless of price, show they break once in a while, but because of the companies quick and courteous response, excellent repair and inital cost, I recommend this controller.
B0015FRC96|5.0|This \\"LP\\" as I originally knew it holds fairly true to the original \\"Progressive\\" theme of the first Genesis albums with Peter Gabriel.  It is a great story and Phil's vocals ring true.  Musically, it is as strong as it needs to be, the magical sound one comes to expect from earlier albums.  If you are a fan of Genesis with Gabriel, this album should please.  If you are a fan of  the group after Gabriel, it may be too \\"Progressive\\" for your tastes, but who am I to tell someone what they might or might not like.  Either way, \\"Trick of the Tail\\" is an enjoyable journey and should be considered a transitional album.  ENJOY.  --try listening to this album in its' entirety with your eyes closed and un-hindered--

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|One of the funniest books I've read, and re-read again. Her chapter on her father was hilarious, self-affirming and made me cry...loved it? Damn right! I want everyone to get this just to see Tina's awesomeness!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It starts off very simply, lulling you into a false sense of security.  Within minutes, you're hooked and things become more difficult than they appear.
B004A8ZWSS|1.0|This is one for the golden turkey book.  The story is preposterous, the acting is tv-like, the action is minimal and wholly unbelievable, and the female star should have been hospitalized and force fed before appearing in a film about Plastic Woman. What an utter waste of time.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I saw this movie at the show and loved it. So I couldn't wait for the DVD release. It's a great story with funny and sad moments. Enjoy!!
B004HXIZVC|4.0|It could be a bit easier to find the off switch for this App. It serves its purpose if listening to the latest postings by people you follow is all you really do with it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie first then I borrowed the book because I didn't know if it was \\"my kind of book\\" after reading it I purchased it and the next two in the series because I wanted all three in my library so I could reread them again and again.  The book went along with the movie but with more detail and explaination as to the whys and what fors of the movie. \\"The Hunger Games\\" is well worth the price.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have Minecraft for my ipod touch, and and it is AWESOME!!!!! In the next update though, it would be nice to have cave systems so you could save your pickaxes from digging and mining. It would also be cool if you could go to the nether. Other than that, Best Game Ever!!!!

0345505387|1.0|The outlander series happen to be my favorite novel series so I took the bait on the graphic novel. My first graphic novel as well. I'm sorry to say it was a rather disappointing experience compared to the sophisticated books.<br /><br />Firstly the first section of the book they've got the pages all mixed up in printing, so it makes no sense unless youve read the original story. Bit annoying.<br />Secondly, being just that: graphic, I had expected better drawings. The caracters were annoyingly visually uncoherent, mostly looking like manga figures, only sometimes the artist pulling himself together to rise the levels. The manga theme I find completely out of synch with setting of scottish highland anno 1740. The pubescent even childish drawings of Claire was marred by the fact that the artist had equipped her (beside manga babyface) with a pair of gigantic boobies who further pushed this thing out in ridiculousness. I guess it's ok if you're 16. And male.<br /><br />K

0486266885|5.0|Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a masterpiece in the truest sense of the word.  In under 100 pages Stevenson cuts to the core of mankind and our weakness.<br /><br />Dr. Jekyll, an otherwise upright citizen, revels in the freedom from conscience Mr. Hyde brings.  He becomes addicted to his alter ego's bravado and lawlessness.  On several occasions Jekyll states with assurrance that he can abandon Hyde at any time.  However, like a junkie, he shallows the potion without regard for the consequences and allows his demon to run free.  At last the evil of Hyde completely eclipses and overpowers the good doctor.  Too late, Jekyll realizes his helplessness.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|I wanted the ultimate \\"survival\\" knife when I found the BK2. So many reviews have been done on this knife all over the web. Most all are positive. Well, after owning and using the knife for about a year, I'll say that the BK2 probably has the best value of any fixed blade that I own. It's big and tough and can handle anything I throw at it. It'll slice, chop, and baton through wood with ease. I've used it for general camp chores and food prep as well. I think something that gets overlooked about the BK2 is how well it excells at small fine work as well. There is a reason that the BK2 is the best selling blade in the Becker line, it can literally do it all!  I've heard a lot of people bad mouth the sheath. I found it to be extremely servicable and functional with no dulling issues. Some will replace the belt loop with a Tek-Lok, which I think is a very good modification. I would recommend this knife to anyone looking for a \\"one knife\\" camp knife. It will last a lifetime.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I don't mind a little sex but good grief these books were redundant on the subject.  I got caught up in the story which was interesting but the writing was poor.  On the whole I felt I had to read the series because I bought it....but at times it was an effort.  I found it very sad that some people really do grow up like Christian.

B0098VXBIA|2.0|This movie is just ok. I rented this movie after reading the book \\"What to expect when you are expecting\\", which is well written. This movie is a comedy & about 4 couples having a baby or adopting a baby. Nothing extraordinary. I can't give it more than 3 stars. I was disappointed by the movie.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|Each of his books are better than the last, and this is no exception.  This story could be playing out today.  Even if you haven't read any of the other John Corey adventures, this one stands alone and should not be missed.
B0085E09H2|5.0|This album will give you an amazing experience and is quite a treat for the ears. Kimbra has tried to include as many different styles/genres in her first album, and results of her painstaking work are evident from the first song. Every one of the songs included are enjoyable, but, of course, a select few stand out more than others (like Settle Down, Something in the Way You Are, Cameo Lover, Wandering Limbs, and Good Intent). But it is very rare to find an album that is as enjoyable throughout as this one. The bonus tracks included on this release are just as great, but I still wish it had some of the other bonus tracks included on other versions of the album (ex.: Limbo, Withdraw). All in all, don't underestimate Kimbra. Anyone going in expecting to hear typical pop fare will be pleasantly surprised. Totally worth it.<br />HOWEVER, as many have said, the album doesn't hold a candle to how Kimbra (and her band) sound live. Her live performances are truly amazing.<br />If I could only make one suggestion, it would be for everyone wanting to check her out to watch the videos of her live performances. Kimbra surpasses everything on her album when performing live. No two performances are alike, but all are innovative, expressive, and infinitely entertaining. Seek out videos of her performing for radio stations (such as KCRW), websites (like for Balcony TV or Sideshow Alley), or during her tour. The Sing Sing Studios set of videos is a great place to start. Enjoy!<br />I eagerly anticipate this incredible artist's future releases.
B001AKTZOQ|5.0|Built a stereo and am rebuiding a library of favorites.  This is a 'gotta have'.  The boys never sounded so good.  Just how old am I?  I dunno, but it sure feels good.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I can't help gush! Rowling is a natural born story teller. The characters are so realistically drawn and the story has incredible depth.
0316228532|2.0|Pathetic little people with pathetic little problems in a picture book village. There is apparently not a normal person to be found in this West Country village. There are heroin addicts, child molesters (both real and imaginary in one OCD character), rapists, self mutilators, unbelievably cruel bullies, wife beaters, adulterers, and the list goes on and on.  There are so many main characters ( identified by the fact that Rowling allows us to see some  of their innermost thoughts) and secondary characters (described by other characters) plus a few cardboard figures, that I needed to make a list to keep track of them all.<br /><br />In the first  few pages of the book, a village councilman suddenly dies, thus leading to the casual vacancy of the title. The man was apparently the glue that tied the village together and, without him, everyones' lives start to fall apart..Peyton Place on steroids. In the last few pages the author tries  to tie it altogether  with a contrived  double tragedy that leaves several of the characters with a ray of hope for the future.<br /><br />Pure drudgery.
B00979CS50|5.0|For an artist as restless as Young, you're bound to get some hits and misses along the line. Its all part of the ride. The years have taught me to approach each new Young release with caution, even trepidation. Am happy to report this is no Mirror Ball or Greendale or god forbid, Chrome Dreams II. Neither is it anywhere close to the mellower likes of Harvest Moon<br /><br />After, a long haitus Young dusts off Crazy Horse again to find little has changed despite the years. They sound as good and ramshackle as ever. Where Americana felt like a half-assed rehearsal, Psychedelic Pill rolls up its sleeves and gets down to business. The ambitious Driftin' Back sets the tone and should go down as a Young classic. At nearly 30 minutes, there's not a dull moment. Psychedelic Pill keeps things going in a compellingly melodic way till things sprawl out like an open road again, with Ramada Inn. Born in Ontario is one of those tracks that brings Don't Be Denied to mind. He's written this kind of autobiographical kind of song before, and yet still manages to offer something new.<br /><br />Young saves the best for last. The last 4 tracks build on each other climaxing with Walk Like a Giant. The infectious Twisted Road finds Young walking with the devil, listening to the dead on the radio. She's Always Dancing harks back to Goldrush era's When You Dance You Can Really Love. For the Love of Man is the albums' most low key and hauntingly still moment. Then Young cranks up Old Black and the Horse for an epic sendoff in Like A Giant, one of his finest melodies in years. Another song destined to be a classic alongside Change Your Mind and Like A Hurricane.<br /><br />While I enjoyed Le Noise, I found it a touch slight and anti-climatic in the end. Not so here. Here Young delivers in spades. For this discerning fan, his finest album in quite a long time.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like this a lot. I have this calculator when I need it, it is easy to use and keeps track of all calculations so I can look back if I need to. I useless it to add up bills and my budget. Saves wondering where I put my other calculator last or when a thought comes to mind when I am on another app. I can get to it easily and go back to what I was doing. It is easy to see and read. Good app. I recommend it if you want an easy to use calculator for everyday use.
B0013LKFVO|3.0|I was thrilled with the way that the 1-watt version upgraded my D-Cell MagLite, and spotted this one thinking that it was the same one, at a better price. Nope. Side-by-side, they're not close. Spend extra and get the 1-watt version, if you are looking for a high-performance flashlight.  OTOH, if you want to save money on batteries, this one will do fine.
B0025KVLRY|5.0|Very good...Itis in excellent condition and sounds great.<br /><br />I love The Beatles! And am very happy that I brought this product.
B007OTTSNU|5.0|While not as informative about the sport as Faster was it has some great video and commentary. Like Faster it seems to be mostly about Rossi, but if you were going to make a motoGP video why wouldn't you. As a Dani Pedrosa fan I felt a little let down with how much they showed about him.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Really enjoyed this book! Started it in the morning and had to stay awake to finish it, couldn't put it down!
B004V5A7K8|4.0|I used to play breakout all the time so this was a nice surprise. this game is simple and to the point - I had issues with how the paddle and ball interacted - hitting it on the side of the paddle always sent ball down, used to be a good way to save it in breakout. the backgrounds at the higher levels were distracting and made playing more difficult - especially since it made light glare off the screen more apparent - I also found that the tip of my finger got irritated being dragged back and forth and had to switch which invariably caused me to lose the ball - I would prefer side controls (thumb controls) as an option, it would make the bigger screens of the kindle and tablets a bit less painful! I miss the musical tones of breakout as well - the sound although perfectly functional was not inspiring. I would pay .99 for this game as it overall was a good experience - fun - and something I can go back to when you want to play a game that doesn't make you think.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|great dvd that shipped very very fast. worth the money and was legen wait for it dary! legendary! definately will look at them again

B008MG1E4A|4.0|As a retired military guy, I found the content similar to conventional forces stuff. Pranks, brotherhood, life things that everyone does. I enjoyed getting into the team stuff where he could get 4 gerber tools, one for each kit, so nice. Very much enjoyed the read.
145162607X|1.0|I kept checking the publication date to make sure it was new.  Still, I recognized every conversation, every emotion of Anne's, every twist, every turn, every bit of paranoia, all of the fear and loathing of the Woodvilles, the love of Richard turning to distrust.  Then I realized I HAD, in fact, read this book before.  Only it was called \\"The Reluctant Queen\\" and was written by Jean Plaidy.<br /><br />How utterly disappointing.  I'm not saying Plaidy's book was great, but this read like someone had just cleaned up her prose.

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|This is an amazing book. Only somebody who knows their isn't always happy endings can read this and say, I love this book. Katniss may not show the same fiery spirit but she still has something. She is broken by all the people who die at her side. She thinks that she will need to die to rid her of thoughts. But Peeta saves her. Read this book if you like tragedy/love/ and loss.
B008D30K7E|5.0|Loved this book and really enjoyed Allan's adventures would highly recommend for a bit of light reading. Really enjoyed it.
B007QPFGJW|3.0|I'm a Nesbo fan and love how he weaves the stories of broken and ruined characters into amazing plots.  I love the cold, dark Norwegian landscape his characters inhabit.  But Phantom is dark even for noir crime mystery.  By the time I finished Phantom I needed sunny beach or a Zanac or both. If you like an occasional walk on the dark side of life you're going to love Phantom.
B008KUQSQC|2.0|The premise of this book, while not unique, is one of my favourites.  Gods of myth are real and roam the Earth.<br /><br />...sort of.  In this version, gods are more a manifestation of faith than an inspirer of it, which in modern day leaves many, many former movers and shakers completely out in the cold.  Most seem no more formidable - and much more poorly adapted to life - than the (more or less) ordinary main character.<br /><br />He is the lens through which we see this world invisible to the rest of us.  And for someone thrown suddenly into mysterious surrounds, he is a surprisingly uncurious, passive, and frustating lens at that.  In fact, at one point it is revealed that his greatest desire is simply to not exist.  I'm not sure it would have made a vast difference.<br /><br />Do not bother trying to figure out the plot.  Though there are clever and subtle layers, the reader is simply not given enough information to appreciate them except in retrospect.  Instead just hold on for an Odyssey-like ride though the author's funhouse.<br /><br />And other than the main character, there are many fascinating characters and features of the landscape.  I'm sure many will enjoy the notion of the 'new gods' which are worsipped as ardently as the old ones, if unwittingly.  Few will doubt the primacy of Television, and I'm sure most of us can think of a few more to add to the list.<br /><br />I don't blame the author for excluding other currently and historically popular religious entities such as the Christian god.  That's a kettle of fish probably not worth opening.  Still, their absence is also a little strange in a world so peopled with minor divinities.<br /><br />All in all, it an okay read, but I personally find the defects a bit too prevalent.  Check out [[ASIN:1480017485 Dark Adept]] or [[ASIN:0812532473 Orion: A Novel]] instead.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|I have wanted to watch this movie since it came out last year. For some reason it only came to select theaters and none of them were near me.The pacing was slow but the energizing soundtrack made up for that.Most of the storylines were touching and easy to connect with.The cinematography is bold and pretty and gives you a feel of what India is like. Every member of the cast does a great job with their part.Especially Evelyn teaching customer service reps how to sound less robotic and unfeeling on the phone.Even though the premise is regarding oldish people who travel to India. I found a much deeper meaning. I may be the only who noticed, I notice weird stuff all the time.All the characters were looking for two basic things. The need to be loved through and through by at least one individual and the need find a healthy way to cope with chunks life takes from you, I think all ages can relate to that. One huge quibble I had was they should have added more to the story of the young exhuberant fellow running the hotel.I found his story flat and the other Indian character's even flatter. I know Indian people and they don't all sound like Apu from the Simpsons.

The movie won the 2010 Golden Globe \\"Best Drama\\" award and may win the top 2010 Academy Award prize (not yet announced as of January 2011 when this review is being written).<br /><br />So, what's it all about and why all the interest? It shows the world of money hungry business majors in college and shows the life of one who grabbed the golden ring, and achieved big money....the wet dream of all business majors and of the part of American society which believes (sincerely!) that \\"the business of America is business!\\" And profits, and big money, and all that is part of that.<br /><br />The star of the movie, Jesse Eisenberg, is a young man portraying a college age undergrad at Harvard College, and was probably born in the 1980's when Ronald Reagan was USA President, and put the final nails in the coffin of Franklin Roosevelt's \\"New Deal\\" programs, and Lyndon Johnson's \\"Great Society\\" and \\"War On Poverty\\" programs.<br /><br />USA President Bill Clinton put additional nails of importance into the same coffin when he gave the USA \\"NAFTA\\" and \\"ended Welfare as we know it.\\" Reagan and Clinton (and the two Bush USA Presidents) announced sincerely that \\"the party's over\\" and it was and is.<br /><br />What remains is what The Social Network (2010) starring Jesse Eisenberg shows.....a heartless social climate where the most famous and prestigious undergraduate college in the USA turns out alumni like Mark Zuckerberg and Zuckerberg's great contribution to America is Facebook and status for him as a billionaire under the age of 40.<br /><br />When American politicians and government renounced Socialism and all vestiges and/or imitations of it starting with the election of Richard Nixon as USA President in 1968, the world of ruthless business grabs, takeovers, fast buck artists, and kingpins like Mark Zuckerberg began.<br /><br />Nixon rolled out the red carpet for all this, and the men who followed (USA Presidents from both major parties, both controlled by big business always without a doubt, regardless of protestations to the contrary) began.<br /><br />The Social Network (2010) shows the USA's national disease at the college level, and shows at least partly what Harvard College has become....not a center of culture and higher ideals, or a place where \\"Veritas\\" (\\"truth\\" in Latin...Harvard's emblem motto) has any place, but place which attracts and nurtures people like Mark Zukerberg and his minions.<br /><br />The Social Network (2010) is not great art. It's not even good art.<br /><br />Like so many Hollywood movies of past times, it is sensational journalism...a portrait of \\"what's happening\\" and a behind the scenes look at it all the \\"newspapers of record\\" never quite inform people about.<br /><br />It's depressing, but it's the truth.<br /><br />The Social Network (2009) is a paradigm of what American culture has become. Low standards, the best school in America taken over by low life, dreadful people, and a major Hollywood movie of low quality made about it all, and given the \\"Best Picture\\" Academy Award in Feb. 2010 (for \\"Best Picture\\" of 2009).<br /><br />Ugly people doing ugly things, and we're all supposed to celebrate this and pay attention to a big movie made about it. Damn!<br /><br />It's like Gertrude Stein telling the world 100 years ago that Pablo Picasso was and is a good artist, and his ugly art worth being ranked with Michaelangelo and Raphael.<br /><br />The Social Network (2009) is eerily similar to Wall Street (1985), made almost a quarter of a century before (Michael Douglas got the \\"Best Actor\\" Academy Award for Wall Stree).

The starting scene of the 1968 movie set the tone.....a dumb plastic fantastic no-architecture hotel of the times, sanitary with no style...and fat Jack Weston as the \\"Everyman\\" introducing viewers to the story and it's people.<br /><br />Rich people were doing better in 1999, the Thomas Crown Affair version of that year shows it....<br /><br />Brosnan's version of Crown is smoother, more elegant and polished, almost like a dancer.<br /><br />The museum setting of the two heists in the movie (the NYC public library built by elegant people was used for \\"museum\\" interiors, the lobby, etc. etc.) makes the movie cultural and celebrates the world of cultured rich people far more than the 1968 movie did.<br /><br />All this is nice....the way \\"comedy of manners\\" movies (and stage plays) about rich people in the 1930's and before were nice.....a look at \\"the good life\\" served up in elegant settings, and enjoyed by its participants for good reasons.<br /><br />Brosnan's clothes fit better than McQueen's did. His (Brosnan's) hair cut is better, less deliberate, more understated and elegant than McQueen's.<br /><br />The trip to Martineque in the Caribbean was a good touch (contrast it to the GUYS AND DOLLS [1956] trip to Cuba made by Marlon Brando and Jean Simmons), and the improved glider plane in the 1999 movie was, too (much less clunky plane than McQueen's was in 1968).<br /><br />I could almost taste the smooth, high priced wine served in restaurant scenes Brosnan and Russo shared. Expensive red wine priced at $50/bottle in liquor stores, double that in NYC restaurants.<br /><br />The 1999 version of Thomas Crown is a travelogue showing the good life in NYC enjoyed by people with time, money, good taste, and all the rest of it.<br /><br />Except for the heavy sex scenes (which aren't believable or attractive), the movie is easy to watch, enjoyable, and smooth....just like an expensive bottle of good red wine, served in a nice place by good people doing the serving and nearby as fellow customers.<br /><br />Dinner Rush (1990) is another 90's movie about rich people in NYC, and their night life (about gangsters in part, but gangsters with elegant haircuts!).<br /><br />Sometimes, the best part of movies is the travel experience they provide, and the plot and even the acting isn't as important.<br /><br />\\"Where were you?\\" is sometimes the question to ask.<br /><br />The Thomas Crown Affair (1999) starring Pierce Brosnan does a good job with that.

B0045HCJQW|5.0|THE PHILADELPHIA STORY (1940 MGM) Was A Great Movie.<br /><br />THE PHILADELPHIA STORY (1940 MGM) starring Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and James Stewart starring Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and James Stewart was a successful 1940 movie based on a Broadway stage play hit also starring Hepburn, Joseph Cotton, and Van Hefflin. Hepburn owned the show, and commissioned writer Philip Barry to write it for her to star in. She met Barry when he wrote Holiday (1938) for her, which also starred Cary Grant.<br /><br />Howard Hughes (a distant celebrity relative of mine, according to Ancestry.Com), Hepburn's sometime boyfriend during the 1930's and also millionaire dilettante \\"player\\" on the Hollywood scene then, advised Hepburn to get legal control of the movie rights to the Philadelphia Story stage play, and she did.<br /><br />The movie was directed by legendary director George Cuckor, one of MGM's most gifted movie directors who worked on both The Wizard Of Oz and Gone With The Wind movies in 1939, the year before The Philadelphia Story, but got screen credit for neither.<br /><br />The settings, costuming, camera work, lighting and technical presentation of The Philadelphia Story (1940 MGM) were lavish and wonderful. It was an important movie of those times (the high point in the Golden Age Of Big Studio Hollywood), and it looks it.<br /><br />I am a Screen Actors Guild movie actor currently (2010) who acted in a Baltimore Maryland USA regional play version of that show in 2003 put on by Baltimore's Paragon Theatre. The Baltimore MD production of it ran two months in Fall of 2003 and was an important theater event at the time. Quite memorable, and I got to know the play well...I played \\"Seth Lord,\\" father of \\"Tracy Lord,\\" the main female character played by Katherine Hepburn.<br /><br />Wonderful aspects of the movie were enjoyable, and the actor work was breathtaking....I have never seen Cary Grant better or more different...a serious, non-comedy, non-romance role for him...quite a change. James Stewart was also very good...he got a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his work in the movie. Hepburn herself was very good, so were others in the movie.<br /><br />The ending was very, very phony, and not a little stupid and ridiculous......girl from hell ends up getting a new husband and marrying him with everybody's blessing....real soap opera stuff.<br /><br />But...nothing is perfect...one has to enjoy the good parts of movies like that, accept the bad parts.<br /><br />The show was written for Katherine Hepburn who paid the author, Phillip Barry, to write a stage play script just for her, and using her particular talents and stage persona....show was about a liberated, independent, arrogant woman of those times (1930's) and she turns into the rewarded hero of the show at the end....because she paid for the show, and the writer was on HER payroll!<br /><br />Hepburn (also a distant, collateral celebrity relative of mine, according to Ancestry.Com) went on to more roles and movies about independent women of the type she seemed to specialize in, but never again ventured into play or movie ownership and production, or commissioning writing especially intended for her.<br /><br />She stuck to actor work, went on to become famous for \\"Tracy/ Hepburn\\" team movies, got 3 more Academy Awards (got her first for Morning Glory in 1932), and became famous as the only actor, male or female, to earn 4 Best Actor Academy Awards, the first in 1932, the last in 1981 (Morning Glory [1932], Guess Who's Coming To Dinner[1968], The Lion In Winter [1969], and On Golden Pond [1981]).<br /><br />Died in 2003 at the ripe old age of 96....had the longest life of any Academy Award Actor Winner in history. Impressive lady.<br /><br />There is a wonderful documentary created when Hepburn was 85 years old which is included in the 2004 DVD edition of \\"The Philadelphia Story\\" (1940) which is the best movie star biography documentary I have ever seen.  Hepburn participated in it and narrated much of it.<br /><br />---------------<br /><br />Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.burn participated in it and narrated much of it.<br /><br />---------------<br /><br />Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.
0689815816|1.0|I have come across both this book and the song that it is associated with several times as have my 3 small children.  They enjoy the song and miming along to it.<br /><br />However, the book drives me crazy!  It represents so much of what I think is wrong with modern parenting.  Dad encourages his kids to set out on whatever ill-conceived and potentially dangerous adventure they can concoct.  The successful resolution of their endeavours leads to them finding themselves in a situation that they can't handle, that endangers them all.  They bail out, run for cover.  But the outcome for the bear?  Sorry, readers, but that final illustration of said bear walking home is so desolate and sad - like he got the wrong idea from this family - they were a promise of fun but they let him down in service of their own selfish needs.  The message to parents?  Your kids are right and noone else's wisdom, advice, needs, or alternative interpretation of events matters.  Yuck.<br /><br />Obviously I don't believe that the bear intended to kill/eat them.  If the premise that going on a bear hunt for fun with small children is acceptable, how can we accept that the bear was all about pure malevolence?<br /><br />Maybe I am reading too much into this?  Its just a tale about a fantasy after all, right? I haven't ever relished this book as embodying the spirit of adventure as others have.  It has always irritated me with its repetitive text and self-centred naivety.<br /><br />Just my thoughts...

0307341550|2.0|After being blown away by Gone Girl, I bought both of Flynn's other novels and read this one today. Like others have said, I'm glad I read Gone Girl first. If this had been my first experience with Flynn's writing, I wouldn't have bothered reading anything else of hers.<br /><br />I get the impression that it's supposed to be a mystery and that we're supposed to be shocked by the revelations in the end, but I found them both to be obvious very early on. I had the murderer pegged as soon as the character was introduced, and the other \\"shocker\\" was so obvious that I initially didn't realize it was supposed to come as a surprise to the reader. I assumed that the reader was meant to understand it without Flynn having to spell it out. In fact, I was somewhat confused as to how anyone else could have failed to connect the dots.<br /><br />I spent most of the book waiting for the heroine to finally realize what had been obvious to me as a reader several chapters in. Almost everything from the introduction of the characters to the revelation of the 'secrets' is just filler. Characters repeat  themselves in words and actions over and over again, and scenes are replayed in memories. I was particularly annoyed by the gimmick of taking up space by inserting the narrator's \\"articles\\", which are basically summarizations and word-for-word reprints of the dialogue and text we just read. It felt like the author was trying to reach a minimum word count. I was bored and found myself looking forward to the end of the book.<br /><br />The characters range from boring cliches to comically unrealistic. The author's fixation on characters vomiting was bizarre; it happens all. the. time. and is described in detail. There's also a strange and awkward emphasis put on the hypersexualized, alcohol and ecstasy fueled 13 year old Amma's breasts, which are mentioned over and over again.<br /><br />If you're expecting something as smart, riveting, and original as Gone Girl, you're going to be sorely disappointed with Sharp Objects. This book was boring, uncomfortable to read, repetitive, predictable, and not even recognizable as being written by the same author.
B0033AX26I|5.0|This is probably one of the most interesting albums I have ever encountered. The music is varied and is based on historical facts along the Mexican-American border. Things are not always what they seem. Irish Americans helping Mexicans? The music is great; performances exceptional; and the historical significance of this music is unrivaled. The album cover and literature inside also contribute to the value of thie album. Get it! Pronto!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I pre-ordered Avengers. I don't usually do that because I have fears of not receiving my items. Not only did I get my item when it was promised. I also got a money back!!! The day the movie was released it went on sale for about $10 less then I purchased it for. Amazon sent me a refund for the amount with out me asking for it. Now I have a movie that we watched in the theater 9 times, excessive I know but it was great, and $10 that I used on rare earth magnets. I am happy.

B008N5UX9M|2.0|I have been an Iron Maiden fan for a long time. I am a big fan of Steve harris and his bass playing. As others have said, I was not looking for a \\"Maiden\\" album done by Steve. I was hoping for something different which this album was. There are some really good songs on here musically and Steve's more melodic bass lines on it are excellent. Unfortunately, I can't get past the vocals. I can't believe this is the best someone of Steve's caliber in the business could come up with for a vocalist. I agree with some other reviewers that the quality of the lyrics isn't the best on every song but a different vocalist would have compensated for that as well. I really like most of the music but the CD is unlistenable (and I played it thru 3 times to give it a chance) due to the vocals. It's headed to my local music store to be traded in.

B004OC07F8|3.0|This is a good book all in all, the thoughts, ideas, the knowledge and information is all there, intriguing and eye opener, the only problem with it is the business-like writing style, full of jargon words, and terminology that are already confusing in their own natural habitats, not to mention in this \\"supposedly\\" fun-to-read book. There were times when I lost interest in reading all the way to the end of a paragraph, or simply dozed off doing it. The style of writing is a bit boring. (Or, I might be getting used to more amusing books to read, my favorites are Malcolm Gladwell's writings, and freakonomics, and the like, which are high up there on the scale of fun-to-read.)

0756404746|3.0|I haven't read a book like this since my first travels through the Belgariad and Mallorean by David Eddings, and I mean that in a good and bad way. When I first read that series of books, I was immediately engrossed in the story and glossed over the lack of literary refinement, wandering plots, and annoying character flaws. As I got older though and went to re-read the stories I realized all the glaring problems that I had missed before. Unfortunately I fear that this trilogy might end up the same way.<br /><br />The story starts slowly. I had to read the first few chapters twice over before I could fully get into the book. Once I got past the initial introduction and realized that the story was more than just something about a small town, bad roads full of robbers, and a boring innkeeper it was much better. There will be times when you are engrossed and can't read the pages fast enough. However, you'll probably quickly bore with Kvothe's arrogance and idiocy. He's dirt poor and never fails to remind you of that fact and how he has no support network to turn to unlike his peers. He adamantly refuses to request help from his friends and overlooks very simple opportunities to gain employment until about 75% through the book. Even then, plot twists end up emptying his purse at every turn. The story goes from interesting to annoying more times than I can count.<br /><br />Perhaps the author was trying to bring home his character's flaws - but I think he went a little heavy handed at times. Overall, I felt that the book could've done with about 30% less filler (especially the whole side story with the girl and the dragon - what point did that serve?) and it would've been a much more entertaining read.<br /><br />Overall, its an exciting new addition to my bookshelf, but I'm not holding out too much hope that Kvothe (or his author) gets his act together in the 2nd book.

B005N1E84K|5.0|I had never heard of Kylie Minogue before purchasing this combo CD/DVD.  I watched the DVD first and remained glued to my couch, mouth open, eyes like saucers, heart pounding, and breathless.  Can I say more?!  From the moment that \\"Aphrodite\\" (Kylie Minogue) arose onto the stage, the songs, the music, the dancing, just flowed one into another without pause, non-stop, breathtakingly.  Kylie was much to look at and follow and listen to just all by herself, but the accompanying dancers, coreography, costumes, acrobatics (at moments I did think of Cirque de Soleil, to be honest) added on just blew the lid off the pot!! Oh, just a minute...I haven't even mentioned the backdrops, the sets, the special effects, the atmosphere ultra-charged with erotica,... and the finale(s) with spurting fountains, lasers, strobes, (seen it all before? I don't think so!) I was emotionally exhausted when it was finally all over. I've watched the DVD several times and each time I go through the same beautiful punishment!  Having said all that, I don't think that those that were physically present at the concert could possibly get what I did sitting at home and letting the camerawork do it's wonders.

B0010SKUYM|2.0|Narrated in the first person by Kvothe (pronounced quothe), The Name of the Wind is a smug, self-congratulatory account of how a self-righteous brat manages to get his way again and again thanks to luck and Rothfuss' half-convincing displays of his main character's cleverness. Mostly good prose and background story earns this novel two stars, but Rothfuss' setting would be much better not see through the lens of Kvothe's narration, which is like listening to a compulsive liar try and make up for obvious self-esteem issues.
1476712042|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book. From beginning to end it was packed full of interesting details to keep you on your feet. I loved both of the characters. What I really loved most about this book was that there was always something going on. There was never a dull moment and it was literally impossible to put it down because you would never come to a point where it was predictable or not as interesting so you always wanted to read what was coming next. I so desperately wish I could find another book like this but haven't yet :( But I would DEFINITELY recommend this book to other readers. Can't wait till Travis' version comes out!!!!!!!!
B005IQZB14|5.0|It was a fascinating story that I could not put down until I had finished it.  I cannot decide if I should make the same trek or not.  The author made it so real.
B00846REIS|3.0|This book is not another Fifty Shades.  While Gideon Cross is a character similar to Christian Gray (rich, controlling, freakishly handsome with issues) that's about the end of the similarity.  The sex scenes were more technical and less inspired than Fifty Shades, however Eva is a much more human character than the completely unaware Ana in Fifty.  What disappointed me about this book, however, was that the plot could be so much more.  The characters are set up to be so complex and could be developed so much more deeply. I would have preferred less attention to the continual review of their good looks, hot bodies, fancy homes, parties and clothes and more attention to what's going on in their minds.  The subject of sexual abuse needs to be dealt with very carefully and in this case the author frequently brings it up but then glosses over it.  I've ordered the second book and look forward to hopefully better character and storyline development.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Little action. Not as good as the first two. Little action...more politics and drama. Would only recommend to finish the trilogy.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Main character (John Corey) is a little too corkey,  The secondary characters are under developed.  Story line dated. The dialogue is great.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book definitely answers questions left by book one. Lots of romance and action! Major twist at the end. Great read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its fun entertaning and my sister keeps taking my kf just to play this game.Finally its on my kf.

0375704027|4.0|I continue to wind my way through Murakami`s ouevre. Next on the shelf at the University library was a small paperback with a garish lo-fi cover. After being submerged in mystery, surrealism and horror; this novel was almost a respite while another great example of Murakami's great skills at creating three dimensional portraits of both sexes. Particularly his women, are living, fire breathing and bleeding beings filled with love and madness. The theme of suicide dominates the plot as the narrator's closest friends and lovers drop like flies. I understand that suicide is perceived differently in Japanese culture; certainly the Christian connotations of damnation are not apparent though young people killing themselves is no less tragic. In the end, the narrator is dragged to the precipice himself and looks the darkness in the eyes but pulls back and chooses life. The final scenes of the narrator and Naoko are poignant and their love making is powerfully cathartic. I will be nostalgic like Murakami was in this novel when I have finished the last of his novels.
B0009353IW|5.0|If you are a fan of Ry Cooder, this is for you. Though somewhat eclectic, he still hits the american rock,the spanish/mexican themes and folky americana. 3rd base Dogder stadium is the last chapter of a story of how the community swallowed up Chez Ravine a mexican neighborhood and turned it into Dodger Stadium. I waited to purchase this till I heard the right song that said come and puchase this collection,All of Ry's music is not for everyone, but give it time.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl keeps you guessing until the end. Who is the bad guy (or girl) here? There are twists and turns throughout the novel. How will it end? You can't imagine! You won't want to put this book down.

B00003CWNR|4.0|\\"The Cider House Rules\\" follows Homer Wells (Toby Maguire), a young man who has grown up at St. Clouds orphanage in the Maine Countryside.  The film chronicles how Wells, a twice-adopted, twice-returned child was raised with love by Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), who heads the institution.  Trained by Dr. Larch as a doctor, Homer helps take care of the children as well as deliver unwanted babies.  Homer, seen as a young man with strong morals, decides that illegally aborting unwanted babies is wrong.<br /><br />When a Wally (Paul Rudd), a World War II pilot, and his pregnant girlfriend Candy (Charlize Theron) come in search of Dr. Larch for an abortion, Homer impulsively decides to leave the orphanage and start his life anew.  Homer begins working on an orchard farm where he meets a colorful array of individuals, all with their own unique problems.  With Wally away at war, Homer begins to grow an affinity for Candy, soon blossoming into love.<br /><br />The film moves at a steady pace, albeit one with some flaws, but nevertheless, it remains engaging throughout.  The underlying sub-plot revolving around abortion and the effects it has on families continues throughout the film, even if it seems a little forced.  There is one particular abortion that pulls at the heartstrings, leaving a gloomy atmosphere on the rest of the film.<br /><br />The engaging acting creates characters that the audience can sympathize with as well as grow to love.  While watching this film, I was torn into many different directions, all of which revolve around brilliant acting.  Everyone, from Toby Maguire to Erik Per Sullivan (Fuzzy), creates memorable characters.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film.<br /><br />Four out of Five stars.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I like the marriage of several types of puzzles.  This is easy enough to be fun, but diverse enough to keep it interesting.

0671449028|5.0|Easy/quick book for bed time.  Sandra Boynton writes great books that are fun to read.  Currently we have 2 of her books, but we hope to get more.  Oh, this book is also good if you want to practice basic ASL when you read.

B000JIHP88|5.0|Our son loved this mobile when he was little.  Now it is nice that you can take off the animals and still have a crib toy that plays music.  This dual purpose makes it worth so much more than a basic mobile.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|enjoyed these boooks very much.  Erotic but yet great story line. I have recommended to others and their response to me was very positive

B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|I bought this as something to keep my mind occupied on boring days, when I got it I couldn't stop building it. It comes with several bags of parts, this set the bags are not labeled in order of use like other sets are, and yes there is allot of parts. I had a great time with it, it's not terribly advanced I think most children over 11-12 could probably handle it if they have other Legos.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app! It is so helpful...I am very appreciative of the large numbers so easy to read. Its a keeper!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy having the Bible available every moment with this app. I can read any time, any where I have a few minutes. There are lots of reading plans...one to fit any need or Biblical quest you might want to undertake. I would give 10 stars if possible.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I read the book first...the characters were so familiar to me. This was a very good, exciting and engaging movie..a must see...
B001BKVWYG|5.0|When listening to this album - it was like opening a time capsule to my early twenty's.  You can play Rodriguez' Cold Fact over and over and like it more each time.  He is easy to compare to Bob Dylan, but different in a soothing soft yet blunt way.  Rodriquez definitely is both funny and rude  -as well as sensitive.  His first lines of \\"I Wonder\\" would shock the middle class in the 1960's -  and \\"Rich Folks Hoax\\" he sings \\"The priest is preaching from a shallow grave, he counts his money, then he paints you saved\\".  Rodriquez also sings of love that died, \\"Thanks for your time, and thank me for mine, and after that said, forget it\\".  His music is a wide window into the 1960's and 1970s- and cleverly parsed words reveal thoughts of rebellion, misunderstandings between people, and wonder at the world growing more outspoken about duplicity.  Now, at 70 years old, his music is finally being appreciated here.<br /><br />Rodriquez grew up in Michigan, his dad becoming foreman at Great Lake Steel and a mother who died when he was three years old. After seeing the movie, \\"Searching for Sugarman\\" I can see how his album's music influenced the anti apartheid movement in South Africa. He was \\"Rock Star\\" in South Africa.  Many of his lyrics speak and spark refusal to obey.  Also after watching him interviewed on 60 minutes, recently,  his humility and decency show how kind and devoted to his daughters the man is. Rodriquez still lives as a \\"minimalist\\" taking little from others or the environment  - donating his long overdue  monies to the three daughters he raised on his own and to other causes.<br /><br />Now Rodriquez is 70 years old - the people in the U.S. are enjoying him and his music.  His concerts are selling out.  Rodriquez deserves this success, and I continue to enjoy the \\"cold facts\\" of his thoughts through the music.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Amusing film.  Well depicted as always.  But for me the reason to watch is the architecture!!<br />LOVE her beach house in every detail and I watch it over and over to soak it in.  Well done<br />to the set designers on that one.<br />Story line a nice change from the usual blockbusters full of weapons!!
B004V5A7K8|5.0|absolutely. love this game. graphics are great fun and easy to play great for eye hand coordination. I would so recommend it
B0067EKY7M|5.0|Terrific film.  Quietly grows on you.  Amusing depiction of Government workings.<br />Touchingly funny.  Great film to watch over and over again.  Thoroughly entertaining... which<br />at the end of the day, is what I look for in a film.
B003TH41H4|4.0|If you like wizards, witches and knights, then this is the show for you.  There is even some hand to hand fighting thrown in for good measure.
0307341577|1.0|after having LOVED Gone Girl, I was really eager to read this. I was SO disappointed & had to force myself to finish it...hoping it would get better (which it did not). Much of it was disgusting, gross & yucky to read....a lot of blood & gore. Characters were not appealing. Boring plot. I do NOT recommend this book!!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|One our family's favorite holiday movies. Love the moose punch bowl set. Every household needs this movie to gt into the holiday spirit.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|will be a good app for winters dark nights. great idea. showed several friends the app. They like it also and plan get the app.
B009QW6ZT8|5.0|This show is definitely a must see for any zombie lovers. I have enjoyed every episode from the beginning and hope this show gets many more seasons.
B003UN409Q|1.0|I watch about 60 movies a year. This one is long, boring and not worth your time to say the least. Very surprising given all the great reviews and Oliver Stone direct it. You could sum this movie up in about 5 min (not 2 hours it takes to watch!) and it could have been told in a more interesting way. Booooo. Terrible movie.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This was a very good movie and I was pleased, however it is not really a movie for kids to watch in my opinion.
B002J2WGLI|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, only because of the style the director shoots his movies. The story line is a little choppy with a few random parts that never really contect to anything, but the ending is a little unexpected and pretty entertaining after watching the slow biuld to the ending climax.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Exciting reading , very detailed account of the intense training involved in becoming and being a seal. I like the prediction that Obama would take credit for killing Bin Lad in, and the comparison of Joe Bidon being like some ones drunken uncle
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I really struggled to rate this book initially.  While I agree with many of the reviewers who felt that the photographs dictated the story rather than being a lovely addition, I can't help but accept that we look for inspiration in all sorts of places. Yes, there are other things that I found irritating- the extremely annoying view of an American author who has clearly never been to Wales and has no concept of the Welsh accent or indeed still holds the archaic view that there are islands with only one phone in the local pub and dodgy locals who haven't moved forward since 1952 - but I found it engaging and finished it in one sitting.<br />I enjoyed it.  Admittedly I was a little disappointed when I realised it wasn't adult fiction as I was expecting but that doesn't take away from the fact that in a world of badly written teen vampire soaked bookshelves, the ideas in this book are unique and Riggs has created a new, interesting world I would be happy to explore again.<br />Did I find it predictable at times? Yes!  Did it feel as though some of it was only written because Riggs found a photograph he wanted to include? Yes.  Would I recommend it?  Absolutely.<br />I want to know what Miss P and the children are going to do next and for me, that means its worth four stars.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The Innocent is another well crafted story for Baldacci, the author. I enjoyed the plot and characters, particularly the main character's struggle to open up and establish a relationship with three different women (albiet one is a young girl).
B004V5A7K8|3.0|but it suffers from a couple of serious drawbacks at least on my Note 2. #1 imput desyncing; by the time Ive played a few games in a row thins are hugely unsyned, doesnt matter if I was playing fingeror stylus. #2 pad speed pad really needs to keep up better way to slugish feeling.<br /><br />Beyound that its a soild fun game if you like block games.  Even whith the imput slughness and desyncing I say its still worth playing... At least well its free.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|In my view this is the best of all the alien movies to date.  It is something like \\"the selfish gene,\\" meets \\"2001-a space odyssey.\\"  The movie had great depth and stayed with me for days after watching it, which I did twice before writing this review.  The writing and acting were very solid and if the viewer paid attention, the meaning of the film was quite rewarding.  SPOILER ALERT!  The movie starts out with one of the tall aliens standing on a earth-like world, next to a massive waterfall, with an alien space craft hanging in the air overhead.  With a religious air, he kneels down and opens a jar and consumes some kind of substance, which causes his body to come apart and he falls into the waterfall.  His body breaks  into many small cells, which grow and divide as they are carried off by the enormous river they have fallen into.  This is an act of creation, and as the movie suggests, it is how the human race came into existence.  The movie then moves forward in time, introduces the 2 scientists/archeologists who have discovered that most of the ancient races on earth worshiped these tall humanoid beings, that they came from a star system depicted in cave drawings, and that humans could not have known about this system without modern technology.  The scientists call the tall ones \\"Engineers,\\" and they feel they are the ones who created our race.  A dying billionaire decides to fund an expedition to this system, so that he can meet his maker.<br /><br />There are 2 very interesting characters that mostly survive the movie- the heroine, Elli, who I felt was very authentic and a great example of what is best about humanity, and David, the android, also authentic, but not being human does things that are evil at times.  For example, he asked Charlie (the other scientist and Elli's lover) how far he would go to find the answers to the questions he has about the engineers.  Charlie says he would go all the way to the end, so David slips an alien substance into his drink that causes him to mutate and eventually die, but not before impregnating Elli with a bizarre alien that nearly kills her.  After a timely abortion, Elli and David discover that the engineers have decided to return to earth and destroy the human race, to build something anew; however, the captain of the Prometheus is able to collide with the alien ship, causing it to crash and our race is saved.  The one surviving engineer comes after Elli to kill her, but she outwits him, using his own technology (and something from herself as well).  Elli now has the option of taking another alien ship and returning to earth, but she decides she is going to travel to the engineer's home planet, to ask them why they wanted to destroy the human race.<br /><br />I like movies that show humans at their best, and this one certainly does.  Perhaps when they take a closer look at Elli, the Engineers may decide their creation was better than they thought.  I really liked this movie!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Becomes more about the emotional relationship rather than just the physical.  Good story progression - not quite as shocking as the first book.
0307960471|4.0|Mesmerizing.  Definitely not a 'feel-good' book. Having visited Scandinavia a few years ago, we were<br />stuck by the huge drug culture.  This book clearly outlines the story of the slide from tremendous potential<br />and ability to eventual death.<br /><br />Excellent writer.
030759565X|5.0|I discovered the Smitten Kitchen blog a few years ago and, over time, found myself returning to SK when I wanted to cook something new.  I have tons of other cookbooks on my shelf and recipes bookmarked from the internet, so why do I always go back to the SK?  One simple reason:  The payoff.  Her recipes never fail despite my best, accidental efforts to torpedo them.<br /><br />I have no training as a chef, but I've cooked my way through portions of Julia Child, Alice Waters, Thomas Keller, and so many other chef's cookbooks.  I admit that I usually start losing interest in a recipe when confronted with seemingly pointless and complicated techniques or ingredients.  I like challenges, but I want to *know* that the fussy steps and 17 dirty bowls, pots, and pans required are going to be worth it when I eat the end result. I'm rather shocked, actually, that I've never cooked a SK recipe and felt like I wanted those 30 minutes or hour (or, let's face it, with some chef's cookbooks, it's more like three hours) of my life back.  It is *always* worth it to make her recipes.  I think that's because she likely faced the same frustration as she became a better home cook and, thus, has done the work to streamline each of her recipes so that every step makes a real difference to the end result.  And her clear instructions ensure that the end results always, always get rave reviews.<br /><br />The SK cookbook is almost entirely new recipes that you can't get online, the photos are gorgeous, and each recipe gives simple, precise instructions (none of the typical, \\"add a handful of X,\\" in response to which I always wonder, \\"Who's handful?  Is my hand the right size?\\").  I've had the book for two days and have already made three dishes, each better than the last.<br /><br />Just buy the book already.  You won't regret it.
B000ATQYT2|1.0|The original uncut version is my favorite Christmas movie, but like the others here I have to join the cause. I am not buying the blu ray version unless it is the original version.
0345522478|5.0|Originally posted on my blog: The Bibliophile's Corner<br /><br />Cover Talk: Good looking guy. Celtic tats. Sword. Good looking guy. Did I miss anything? I think not. I also really dig the font for the title and such.<br /><br />First Impressions: I can't remember where I found this book. On someone's blog, I know for sure. And the second I read `Druid' in the series title, I knew I had to read it. I have a huge obsessions with druids. I think in a past life I was  female druid. No lie. It would explain my constant need to learn things.<br /><br />First Few Chapters: Oh. My. Gosh. From the beginning, I was roped into this world and it was incredibly easy to get invested into Atticus' survival. In just the first few chapters, he encounters a couple of goddesses and gets attacked by some minions from his enemy Aenghus Og who is after a very special sword.<br /><br />Characters: Atticus is badass. End of story. Okay, not really. He is very intelligent, very witty, and such a smart ass. While he only looks 21, he is in fact 21 centuries old. He is a Druid *swoon* and runs an occult shop. I found his knowledge to be ridiculously attractive. I really hope that in future books, he'll go off on tangents and let known all of the things he knows. I also love his fighting skills with the magic and many kinds of martial arts, sword fighting, etc. I seriously just love everything about him.<br /><br />Oberon is Atticus' Irish wolfhound. I really want a wolfhound now. I want to be able to talk to him too. Oberon is such a fun character, I honestly didn't realize that he was going to be one. I thought he would just be here and there when Atticus was home. But Atticus and Oberon stick together and they are a family. It's quite adorable. Oberon is definitely the comedian. I thought Atticus was funny, but I laughed so loud just about every time Oberon spoke.<br /><br />So far as the other characters go, the various gods and godddesses, witches, vampires, werewolves, etc. there wereso many that I could not possibly talk about them individually. I will say that though there were a lot of creatures and beings to keep up with, I think Hearne did a wonderful job introducing to all of them. He gave them just enough of their own vibrancy to make me remember them each. I hope we learn more about them in the following books.<br /><br />Plot: Oh, the Irishness! I love it so much. I have Irish blood from both sides of my family and have been obsessed with Ireland and all it's history since I was a small child. Specifically, druids. It was amazing to read this book and see this bit of history in a different light. I love learning about the different gods and goddesses and of course, there are creative liberties. But I really feel as if Hearne's world could easily exist. Easily.<br /><br />This book is definitely fast paced. I took my time reading it because I just did not want it to end. I keep leaving myself on cliffhangers; believe me, every last sentence in every chapter is designed to keep you going on and on. It's brilliant.<br /><br />I really don't want to give too much away, because the journey of discovery made it enjoyable. Especially the introduction of all these characters that I hope to see more of. The magic, history, and fighting make this book absolutely brilliant. The magic is incredibly, the history is entertaining, and the fighting is well done.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: This book is freaking brilliant. I love how well Hearne was able to incorporate so many different myths, religious figures, etc. and making them all believable. Atticus is definitely one my new favorite male heroes/protagonists and Oberon is definitely one of my favorite animal characters. You need to read this book. Right now.

B007FEFLTO|4.0|After reading Pillars of the Earth I was excited to read another book by Ken Follett and this trilogy has been great. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish there were fewer uses of the more vulgar profanity. I can handle the minor four letter words but the more robust terms make reading the book at times, challenging. Follett does an excellent job of weaving fiction and nonfiction together to tell a fantastic tale. I'd love to find a Christian author who could write something along these lines but keep the profanity to a minimum if at all.
B0096HHZGK|5.0|I usually don't like it when Hollywood converts a book/show/whatever into a movie. Wow! They did an amazing job. The casting is right on point. Most memorable is Tom Cruise is incredible as Stacee Jaxx the \\"infamous\\" rock star of the movie. He totally pulls off playing a character that is probably 20 years younger than he really is. Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand - perfect. Obviously, changes from the original Broadway Show story line and different songs performed/not performed. The \\"mash-ups\\" really worked. This is what happens when you take something else and make it your own. I thought this was \\"right on.\\"

B00005JMJG|5.0|beautiful film, because it is both very sophisticated - with a warped chronology that functions as a riddle solved only towards the end, scenes that are \\"in the imagination\\" rather than, as you thought first, \\"for real\\" but leave you scratching your head at what link they might have to reality (has anybody commented how close the script is to the universe of Philip K. Dick?), great special effects, both computer-complex and sometimes (as you see on the bonus features) deceptively simple, and virtuosic camera-work - but also very romantic and stirring deep emotions, that anyone with a bit of experience in (failed) love relationships will easily relate to. \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" is a film about being, deep inside, deep under, madly in love, about Orpheus going into Hell to reclaim the life of Eurydice, about salvaging one's love from the throes of annihilation. The more bitter the split, the more profound the love, whose memory claws and your heart devours (not a citation by Alexander Pope).

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best bible app ever! THIS APP CAN REMIND YOU DAILY WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT IN YOUR LIFE AS A GUIDE TO  WHATEVER PROBLEMS YOU HAVE!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app has changed my life. It is very easy to use. My life has always lacked proper discipline.  With this app I have given myself a regular daily routine. My body now has adapted to this by itself but I still use the app to make sure that it stays that way. Congratulations on a great app!<br />Thank You,<br />Grammacozy62, Nancy Bettac Barton
0425241505|2.0|I am going to give this one 2 stars because I did finish it, otherwise it would have gotten 1 star.<br /><br />The main characters here are caricatures mainly, and the story is boring, boring and boring. Especially Dragos is like a mirage, or something like that, since he really does not have a deeper personality.<br /><br />The storyline is just as you expect, everything you are guessing will happen, there are no surprises, nothing out of the ordinary.<br /><br />The good things with this is that Thea Harrison can write, that's what got me through the book, her writing.  I wish that she would have had time to develop great characters, a great original and deep storyline, instead of this half assed book. It seems to me that this is an attempt from the publishing house to get some more money from this genre - as cheaply as possible.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This is the last book of the trilogy and it shows. The first two books i thought were really good, but the last one was like the author was ready to get done with it. The events in the book happened and was over with so quick u didnt have a chance to get into it. I wish the author would have taken more time and extended it to a fourth book or more.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I think this game is fantastic!!! I love it cause it challenges you, whether your new or advanced at this sort of thing. Never boring or so difficult that you want to give up. I am truly looking forward to any future games that this organization comes up with. Totally Awesome!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This is one of Grisham's best novels. I don't think it's as good as The Litigators but it is one of his better books. The story is captivating and engaging from the very start. I read it on my Kindle in just three days so it moves along well and presents a very different perspective from the point of view of a convicted felon. I recommend if you're only going to read one Grisham, read The Rainmaker or The Litigators. If you read most of Grisham's books, by all means read The Racketeer. You won't regret it!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Very nicely written.  Great story line.  The ending was surprising and getting there was exciting. I will definitely read Kate Mortons other books.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Really great one. After reading first and second dragon I didn't expected to find third one as good as the previous one but to my surprise the last was is also very well written. Even if our dragon is tide up to the hospital bed the book have so much action in it then all previous books in together. I really do recommend that book too
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I read it because I am a Patricia Cornwell fan.  I feel her books lately are not as good as they use to be.  I am not sorry I bought it, but not the exciting read i wanted.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this nightly as my alarm clock.  The math problems help wake up my brain, and I like having my own music to wake to.
0316228532|1.0|I get it J.K. Rowling. There is a class divide in Great Britain, as well as in most of the world. But the people who you've written about- those people who most need to realize that there is a great and horrid injustice- they are not reading your dismal book. Even if they bought it, after the first description of teen-aged sex, they would stop reading it. The people who are reading it, like myself, are well aware of that miserable world, and read to escape it. I am a great fan of your earlier work. It seems amazing that all of the joy that you have given me in the 10 years of the HP series, has been abruptly taken away by this horrible, horrible book.<br />It is in my recycle bin, so that I can rest easy knowing that no one will ever read my copy of it ever again.
B007MDB6L0|4.0|At least at the 19.96 dollars dvd version, the 'Pixie Hollow Games' movie isn't included. Only the two music clips from the main songs on the movie. Besides that, the movie is great and highly recommended to everyone. I mean this one: [[ASIN:B007MDB6L0 Secret of the Wings]]
B008KMHFJY|4.0|I like the surprise element of Abby's secret talent which was revealed later in the book. It wasn't all about Travis.<br /><br />One point deducted for the not very realistic \\"bet\\" they've made. Everything else was great, the fight, Travis' family, the love triangle, just an epic love story.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|This album is probably not a 5 star record, but too many people are leaving stupid reviews so I need to off set the stupidity. That being said this is a very solid effort. The songs seem to flow very nicely on this record. Most songs are catchey and enjoyable enough for a repeat listen. Is it their best? Of course not, but most artists put out their best work only on their firt few albums. Buy it now! It's up their with Warning and the last album. I just can't understand people who are saying Green Day sold out? They were huge in 1994 people. You might not have been born yet to see it.
B000KKPN5C|3.0|I just bought a SB-700 and the results are SO much better.  My SB-400 is going up for sale on eBay today.  The basic idea behind the SB-400 is to give you something better than the built-in flash without having to lug around a big-boy flash.  So I would still recommend the SB-400 as a stepping stone for a novice who wants to step up from the pop up but is not yet ready to go all the way.  But to me it became the worst of both worlds - I still had lug around an external flash but I still didn't have the capabilities I needed.
B008I3QZKU|4.0|This album didn't change my life, but it's not bad either. I expected a little more, but it's still good. It's by far not their best record. But, I still like it and I think their are many catchey songs on it.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is addictive! It is a basic match 3 game with a lot of twists and turns. Thereis a great story line that goes along with the game! The levels get progressively more difficult. I have almost finished the whole game and I don't want it to end!!!
B008RYN44U|3.0|Ten years for this? Really? That being said it's not a bad album, it's just not great. There are some catchy songs on this record. But, a lot of it just takes getting used to. 1995 to 2003 was really their hey day . I'm glad I saw them open for Bush back in 1996. I never thought this band would explode the way they did.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this game it is good for the kids it can keep them occupied for a long time. but it could use a little less advertisement but over all i would tell others to play this mini game bonanza!!!:)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A well written science fiction fantasy about a society confined to life in silos. The book provides interesting insite into societal reaction to individuals who think independently in pursuit of truth while exposing deception.<br />An exciting, thought provoking read.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I've had the chance to test the Seiko 5 for over a week now and it has been holding up very well.  The green dial color is a shade darker than the picture portrays.  Although the lens is a mineral lens, it has been holding up quite nicely with no scratches.  There has been no noticeable loss or gain in time as some folks have mentioned.  The watch face itself is small, but considering my wrist is slim (6.5in), this is a perfect size.  The movement works perfectly without any hiccups out of the ordinary.  All in all, I would definitely go for another Seiko automatic again in the future.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|As I was reading this book I began to think I had read it before.  So much like previous story lines that I had to double check publication date.  Seriously, how many serial killers are thinking of the coroner when they commit their crimes???

B008WCP2PG|1.0|I am so glad I didn't end up buying this movie. It was so boring that I ended up fast forwarding through some of it. Please can someone give me back the last 2 hours of my life!<br /><br />This has to be one of the sleaziest movies I have seen in a very long time. The acting wasn't that great and from all the reviews it got when it was in Theaters I really expected more than this. The dancing was probably the only good part in the movie, the drama was sub-par and the female lead... um yea ok.<br /><br />Don't waste your money buying this movie. If you have to watch it I would recommend renting it or waiting for it to come on TV or Netflix. Really one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I love the actors in this movie.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I bought this for my grandchild.  It works really well keeping the pacifier in the baby's mouth and it keeps you from losing the pacifier.

B008PQ8XZK|5.0|\\"The secret keeper\\" is a touching story. One of the better books I have read during the recent years. I am looking forward to the next novel by Kate Morton.
0316067601|1.0|If you want nearly 400 pages of unabashed support for George W. Bush and Donald Rumsfeld, while at the same time a hate-laced tirade against the supposed, \\"liberal media\\" than this is the poorly-written book for you!<br />Patrick Robinson (who actually wrote the book, not Luttrell) even goes so far as to say that young men in America are scared to join the Armed Forces because they, \\"...might be accused of war crimes, just for attacking the enemy.\\"  Sigh.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This is a movie that every kid should watch, they should know what it is to conserve trees and nature, its thoughtfull of people to come out with such a movies, kids are our future and they need to be educated about such things else what they show in the movie might turn out true. A world without trees and animals sigh!!!
B005EGXTHG|5.0|The hardest thing about this book is that it ends. Easy to read a page turner. I couldn't stop thinking about it and had to read every chance I got.
B008NABUU8|1.0|Whatever you do, do NOT get this game. Especially if you have a kindle fire. This game has crashed my kindle relentlessly. IT SUCKS.

B008OOYALE|3.0|It's a good app and cute but soon the whole screen turns blue and it wont respond. The dragons are very cute though. I wish I could give it 5 stars. :(
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I ENJOYED WATCHING THIS MOVIE IT WAS BOTH CUTE AND FUN TO WATCH.  I LIKE WALL-E<br />HES PRETTY NEAT!  tHERE WERE SOME SAD MOMENTS IN IT BUT YOU FIND THAT YOU GET ATTACHED TO WALL-E.  I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE BECAUSE ITS CUTE AND FUN TO WATCH AND<br />YOU HAVE TO ROOT FOR WALL-E.  HES A NEAT MACHINE!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Isn't it self-explainitory? I mean, you can't really ruin this classic American novel. The book in itself was of good quality and very funny.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This was a fun game until the update last week. Now it freezes and crashes almost instantly.  I used to play every day, but now I can't do a thing.
0195145925|3.0|Barbour has done his homework, but he fails to properly support his own premises. He boldly gives his own opinions/conjectures, but fails to use standard philosophical, experimental, formulaic, support. He admits that his premises are merely \\"qualitative\\" and not well supported. However, the book is worth the effort because of the rich exploration of related topics that seem to support the Standard Model, General Relativity, particle physics, quantum mechanics, and quantum cosmology.<br />I recommend that you read Leonard Susskind's books, Black Hole Wars, and The Cosmic Landscape; Hawking's A Briefer History of Time, and Black Holes and Baby Universes; Roger Penrose's The Road to Reality(for advanced readers who love math); Greene's The Hidden Reality; String Theory for Dummies. . . and to bring your math up to some level of snuff: Precalculus Demystified; Blitzer's Intermediate Algebra; Calculus Demystified forcusing on Intro. to derivatives, partial derivatives, applications related to physics; Calculus Demystified, or for Dummies; and any related material you may already have. Also see Smolin's What's Wrong with Physics, and Woit's Not Even Wrong. Use Wikipedia for terms you are fuzzy on, and think, think, think. . . Barbour tries but fails to justify our dumping of time, motion, and dynamics! ! !
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Different vision from the movie than you would ever imagine; very more adventurous book as well i can not wait for the next book
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I really have enjoyed Call of Atlantis.  I have found no bugs nor any other problem and have actually played for hours at a time.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Wonderful game, play at your own pace. Can make it more challenging as your skill increases. Love it. Good for quiet entertainment.
B004GJVI5C|2.0|Bad acting and just plain boring.Unless you just like Ben Aflack this movie is not very interesting. Don't spend your money.
B009OA57MI|5.0|Amazing game! Never gets boring. Worth $2!!! If you buy get the LITE version first. Fun.  It makes you want to keep playing
B000002VFW|5.0|I never could understand why the supremely talented Lisa Stansfield wasn't more popular. She's simply, or perhaps not so simply, amazing. I purchased this album back in 1990 when it first came out. Her vocals blew me away. She has such range and depth and she sings with raw emotion. If you are new to Lisa Stansfield check out some of her other albums. Don't stop with just one!
B0091REZMW|4.0|this is a pretty cool game. There are a lot of components to the game. and you get to make friends. so cool.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is really good. normally I wouldn't leave a review but I been up since 4am gotta work at 10am, and just killing time. but seriously helpful,  detailed aand beaucoupe features.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|Very well written Open insight into both the person and the birth and growth of not only Apple, but how all the technology companies contriuted.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|its a cool game to waste your time no reason for it to be 99 cents though but if you like puzzle I highly recommend this game for you
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This met all of my expectations and the price made it a great deal.  It was well worth waiting for the complete set as I enjoyed the movies a lot.
0425263908|5.0|Nothing better then this well maybe the 2nd book!!! It's a great love story mixed with great sex scenes!! What more do u need?
B008476HBM|5.0|This is such a great novel. I have the paper book, one on my kindle, and also 2 movies. I think this is the best book from Austen.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|great application for estimating time left using an app before battery charging is necessary. very easy to use. definitely recommended.

0765348276|4.0|To start, I know this book has been out for a while and I have wanted to get it, but was a little afraid too. After all, it has gotten such great reviews all around and is possibly being made into a movie since Paramount Pictures acquired the rights (reportedly being produced and directed by Wolfgang Peterson), that I was afraid it would be the typical over-hyped piece of fluff. Then came an opportunity to acquire the desired book with some added benefits. Thank you Humble Bundle. First published in 2005 and nominated for a Hugo Award in 2006,  to see the rest go to: [...]
B008I34ZFW|5.0|Political satire at its best ! This movie is hilarious. Sublime one lines and in your face punch lines. Special effects is top notch, you would believe its from a major studio, but its not, its better !<br /> Politics \\"Party line \\" has a new definition. Yes we can !  Whos the President of the U.S.A. ?  LOL.  Race gets a new punch line. No sacred cows in this movie .<br />Highly reccomend. Family friendly except for one scene's depressurized.My only complaint is how long til the prequel / sequel . Can Not Wait.
0486278077|4.0|It arrived very quickly.  It was perfect for me to carry around while at work. The quality was what I paid for. Thank you.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Bonus disc packed with amazing content. Together with the second screen app, offered a unique fun experience. sending stuff from my iPhone to my TV.

B0083P1QUM|2.0|I usually enjoy Patricia Cornwell's books but this one was not interesting and very boring to me. I was very disappointed in the book.
B002V092M4|4.0|Le Carre's book stoill has great shelf life nearly fifty years  after it first appeared. The writing is elegant and memorable, characterization superb, the story line fascinating - complex but engaging - all in all a great read and a \\"Must read\\" for any interested in the spy/thriller genre...
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|watch it and i promise that you will never ever regret watching this movie. you will recommend it to others. its that good
1563890119|4.0|Intricate story. Good art, especially cover and spread art. A dark, dreamy mood throughout. We are dealing with The Sandman here, the Lord of Dream. The first two books are horror stories filled with violence and gore. I understand the later books move out of the horror mode into other modes of dreaming.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Takes you into their world. The characters are very well developed and the plot has twists and turns everywhere. I couldn't put this book down. Well worth reading.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Most of us have heard about people's experience of life after clinical death. This account differs in that the writer is a sckeptical neuro-surgeon. Skeptical, that is, until he had his own experience. Although the author comes from a Christian background, his interpretation doesn't really include that world-view. He has an excellent appendix for further reading, including up-to-date university and medical school studies.
0374214913|5.0|I don't know what it is, but I always end up being drawn to novels about books. Or novels that take place within a bookstore or library. Or even ones that are about someone writing a book of some sort. That of course was the draw of Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore.  Not only did it pose a delightful mystery/puzzle about the goings on in said bookstore. But it also posed a great surprise for me in that it contained info and references to technology, which also interests me in everyday life. Additionally all the talk about coding has given me a new zest for it and so I might even try my hand at it again. Whereas before it was a struggle to understand.<br /><br />This novel also reminded me a bit of The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield (the whole bookstore thing) and a bit of The Eight by Katherine Neville (the puzzle/mystery aspect). Both of which I thoroughly enjoyed in their own respects. But still there is something just unique about this novel that I can't put into words. If you love a quirky, mysterious story then you definitely need to pick up Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore and experience the wonder for yourself.
0316228532|1.0|I so looked forward to this book. I was an early fan of the first Harry Potter book and got many people interested in the series. I thought I knew J.K. Rowling as an author and person, but I was wrong. This book is completely different, and it is gratuitously vulgar as far I am concerned. I made it through the first 60 pages, but someone would have to pay me a lot of money to finish it. I have really lost respect for J.K. Rowling. She obviously does not care about her loyal readers who got her where she is today. Her books can be completely different from Harry Potter, but there is still a need for an interesting plot, sympathetic characters, and some sense of understanding not everyone wants gross sexual references in their fiction. This was a complete waste of money.
B007UW9VWO|5.0|I confess I am a huge fan of most things Japanese.  I viewed this documentary with a fair amount of skepticism, hearing so much praise usually ends in disappointment.  But gladly the praise was not misdirected.  Jiro Loves Sushi is exactly what it appears on the surface: a documentary about Jiro Ono, one of the most revered sushi chefs on the planet, and his restaurant, Sukiyabashi Jiro which is located in a subway station in Ginza, Tokyo.  Oddly (despite the location), the restaurant has achieved international renown and even famed chefs and celebrities claim it is the greatest sushi restaurant in the world.  Michelin has awarded three stars.<br /><br />So it is interesting to see the documentary showing the creation of the highest level of sushi as an art.  The director, David Gelb, seamlessly blends amazing classical scores with the beautiful imagery.  Philip Glass is the main composer used, though Tchaikovsky, Mozart, and Bach all make appearances.  The shots of the finished sushi being plated are marvelous.  And I'm a vegan for crying out loud!<br /><br />One of the other aspects I enjoyed was that Jiro and his son both bemoan the reduction in quality and quantity of seafood due to over fishing.  It is a serious problem, especially in a country as dependent on seafood as Japan.  Jiro even states that there should be restrictions on the minimum age of tuna caught and that nets should be banned in favor of line catching tuna (thereby creating a safe environment for other sea creatures such as dolphins and ensuring that immature tuna are returned to the sea).<br /><br />Many folks have stated that they wanted to see more about Jiro's home life, but I really think the director was wise in keeping to mainly the restaurant.  Jiro's sons feature prominently in the documentary, though his wife is absent.  Perhaps she wanted to stay behind the scenes?  Or perhaps they just have a private family life.  Whatever the reason, the viewer is focused on Jiro, his sons, and the employees of the restaurant.<br /><br />The interesting little nudge on the shoulder at the end was the director insinuating that Jiro's son has actually been the real brains and artist behind the restaurant.  Every time the Michelin critics dined at the restaurant, it was Jiro's son that prepared and served the sushi.  Interesting.<br /><br />It's a good documentary, nothing flashy or controversial.  It is rare that a nice, straightforward documentary is released to rave review.  Please rent or buy this documentary.  You will be most happy.  Irashai!!!employees of the restaurant.<br /><br />The interesting little nudge on the shoulder at the end was the director insinuating that Jiro's son has actually been the real brains and artist behind the restaurant.

B009ZQAN9I|5.0|This is facinating, what a unique twist, I never thought we would be following the many lives of the same people over and over again. This gives AHS the ability to create very new and diffent stories each season while keeping us engaged with the characters. We are only on ep.3 and already you can see how langes character is very similar in this life as she was last season. There is a spiritual belief that we live lives in groups, revisiting life as brothers, mothers, lovers of the same group of people. Im curious if this is based on that concept. As usual I cant wait to find out. Love it.
B000YPUFA6|5.0|Hello I'm telling you the order arrived and everything is in perfect condition. I'll keep buying more stuff. They are of very good quality. 100% recommended.
B003WV7836|5.0|Once upon a time I had Sennheiser earphones and pretty much nothing else. I went two years using the CX300II's and then bought the CX310's. Then I purchased the Ultimate Ears 500, 700, and TF 10's. Then I decided I wanted a new Sennheiser product in my collection. I looked at the IE8's and 80's, but those have yet to float down to the $125.00 I paid for my UE TF 10's, so until I get that type of deal on either of those IEM's, I pulled the trigger in the CX 880's, since they normally list for $150.00, and were on sale on Amazon for about $50.00. I read mixed reviews, though mostly the majority of reviews on sound were solid if not spectacular. It's the build quality that took a huge hit in the community. When they finally arrived, I anxiously opened the box and got my hands on these. I plugged them in, no burn in time, straight out of the box, into my Sansa Fuze with my Fiio amp. The match was a no go. They simply did not sound very good on the Fuze. The problem being that on the Fuze, the mids were recessed. i mean VERY recessed. So i decided to plug them directly into my ipod. Ok. Better. The mids were now balanced along with the lows and highs. So it has to do more with the way the 880's interract with the Fuze. I then preceeded to go with a 6 hour burn in with pink/white noise and sweeps. I took the 880's and put them through my amp using my rockbox'd sansa clip zip. The sound coming from the clip was GORGEOUS! The highs are so CRISP and CLEAN! There's roll off, but the sparkle on the highs is simply impressive, and made the more impressive because the lows match the highs with fullness and boom without bleed or muddiness. The mids are natural and vocals really shine. There is just terrific clarity and balance through the entire frequency range. Now let me say that these are obviously not to be driven too hard, since the clarity gets grainy and the bass overwhelmed when pushed at high volumes, so these are best listened to at 60-70% volume max. Right now as i write this, I'm listening to my 880's, aware that the soundstage is above average and wide, and the instrument separation is also above average, though imaging could be better...I'm not gonna mince with the small things. The SQ of the 880's is simply worth more than the $50.00 I paid for them. As far as comfort, these are super comfy with silicone tips I borrowed from my UE's. The tips that come stock are weak at best. As far as build quality? I love the way these things feel in the hands. The looks are very catchy and the silver and black simply make for attractive IEM's. Will they last? Will the volume control faiL? i don't know. We'll see. My other Sennheiser products always had long life. I expect the same of these. I'm very pleased with my purchase, and look forward to many hours of musical enjoyment using my 880's. Now on to getting those IE 80's.

B001NXDIMK|4.0|Product was fine for used DVD.  Purchased, so I could watch @ my leisure & not worry about having to return if a rental.  Am doing all 4 seasons this way - good way to go & who cares what the container looks like.  By the way, that too was fine.

B005LAII0I|5.0|It really is one of my favorite family movies! Cute. Humorous and a fun spin on snow white . I recommend
B009KHCRVO|5.0|This film takes sci-fi into the realm of comedy. Much like Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland did for the Zombie film. This film is so funny! A great story, lots of action and a surprising protagonist who's really full of heart. Also, the special effects are stellar, this looks like a major studio production, but flouts the cliches that drag so many films into stupid territory. I will watch again and again.
B008OOYALE|5.0|relaxing and fun for all the family.  grow your cute baby dragons to adults and multiply.  you level up very quickly and get to create your own dragon fantasy land.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I wasn't familiar with Pressfield's non-fiction work until my son told me to check this out. Now I have bought the other two that go with it and am hooked. I don't know the last time I have been so awakened, perhaps shocked by a book. Steven takes a new look at what holds us back in life, as a writer and any other profession. He outlines quite simply and directly the subject of 'resistance'in a way I'd never have thought of on my own. He challenges you and makes you think. And if you do ... it has the potential for life change. A truly outstanding read for writers and others interested in reaching their potential. I read a whole lot and this one really got my attention.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|I didn't particularly enjoy this but I can see why some people might do. It does take a while to get going but then quite a lot of stuff does happen. I did find that it got slightly repetitive and the dialogue though amusing at times was quite clunky.<br /><br />I just don't like the writing style so that was a big barrier to me getting anything out of this book. Others probably won't have that problem. It was fairly competently done and there wasn't anything too awful about it I just didn't really enjoy it.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|What else can I say?  Must have for Halloween!  If you've never seen Rocky Horror in a theater, you might not understand the allure of this movie.<br />Video quality and sound were excellent, didn't look at any additional material or features yet, but they are included on the DVD.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|From beginning to end it was great. Once u start reading its not easy to put down. Recommended to all of my friends!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Epic in scope, layered in details that reward those who pay close enough attention, or watch multiple times. A Quasi-prequel to Alien, but stands well enough on its own.
B003O86FMW|5.0|From beginning to end it was great. Once u start reading its not easy to put down. Recommended to all of my friends!
B009NQKXYK|5.0|What a surprise. The story puts a new slant on what you think you know. I really liked the ending.

B00005QDW1|4.0|I was very pleased w this cd. Its one of my favorite no doubt cds! I got almost what I was expecting.... they need to change te im age they are using bc they put a red image down and I received a black one. I'm a collector and know that several covers were made 4 this album. I was hoping 4 the red one since I didn't have that one. Otherwise I'm completely satisfied. Its a great album.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is a great game for grandparents to play with even their youngest grandchildren--in fact my 5-year old grandson is the one who wanted me to download it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its finally here! Popular on Apple products and now on here.. Everyone who wants to know ... Its like Temple Run which the concept is the same... so enjoy - cocolina
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|[[ASIN:B006BGZJJ4 Amazon Kindle Micro USB Cable, White (Works with Kindle Fire, Touch, Keyboard, DX, and Kindle) - Updated Design]] This cable functions OK until the connector molding separates from the wire , exposing the wire and subjects the wire to stress which will break it.  I fixed this by wrapping with duct tape.  This is shoddy manufacturing. A proper connector mold to wire transition is required.  I am disappointed in two ways. 1) The price for a $ .50 cable is quite high. 2) The quality is poor.  Amazon buyers should be on top of this kind of vendor performance.  I am inclined in the future to look for products elsewhere.  I am not likely to upgrade to a Kindle Fire based on this poor quality product.
0525953728|5.0|Not only is this a great book but the it was shipped and received really fast! I would strongly recommend this book!
B006YXTRHY|3.0|This film was better than any of the other Twilight series movies. The actors seemed much more comfortable in their roles this time around.
0062127241|5.0|I have always wondered how a Rocker can have such a memory. Pete Townsend has led a long and troubled life with nearly all of the British artists around him. The 60's and 70's come alive with the reading, and the pictures are great.
B008R14YBK|5.0|This CD is so cool. I think the best song is rocks at my window.Bridget has a great voice and is very pretty. I would highly recommend this one for ages 6 to 19.She did a great job!
B002RI9ZPY|4.0|Its not possible to review any one book in isolation,well maybe Dragon Tattoo could be read on its own,you would not understand Hornets Nest unless you had read the previous two books.That said however the whole tilogy was brilliant.Back to Hornets Nest,this book brought me back to my youth CHANDLER and all the gang,Bogey would love her as a sidekick.Ithink Salander mellowed too much in the end,I liked the mixture of fact and fiction where appropriate it fleshed out the storyline very well.Itmade think of Dennis Potter meets Jeffrey Archer.Polititions would hate this book, it shines a light too brightly on there world.Someone will have to pick up Salanders life and let her loose again,every country needs a Salander and a Seig Larrson.
B008S4FZHI|5.0|I could not put this book down..literally read it from cover to cover. I am a big fan of Scarpetta but I believe most fans of the genre would enjoy this read.
B006JN5KBG|5.0|I love this movie. It is a great movie. Unfortunately $200 for a Blu Ray disc. Someone has to be on drugs to pay so. Amazon should not allow items over price like this one been posted.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it really needs buckets boats mods more seeds pumpkin jack o lanterns texture packs and phanie packs. mojang pleasssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssse put those exact things in there please :) /thank u
B007VYDFMS|5.0|Never knew or heard much about Marley aside from his popular hit songs, but had always been intrigued by him. This was a fantastic documentary, both in content and production value. So much that I did not know about this inspiring human being. Definitely worth watching!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|After this book, how could anyone not believe in our amazing creator.  A fact filled, well detailed story of which doubts cannot exist.
B007PBKG5G|4.0|The top reviewer has it right. Such a soulful, deep, raw sound. It gets down in your guts and shakes you to the bone. I've known OF the Shakes for a while, but only bought the album today after hearing a few tracks on Youtube. Timeless stuff.
1451695195|3.0|I waited with much anticipation for the release of Dr. Alexander's book `Proof of Heaven'.  Of course I cannot comment on the validity of his experience since I have not had any such experience but I am always interested in what others who have had near-death experiences report. I do think, as others have commented, that too much space was used in reporting family interaction and medical detail.  I would like to have read more of his near-death experience but on the other hand it is possible that as time passes after coming out of the comma the memory details begins to fade.  On my part it is interesting to compare Dr. Alexander's vision of what happened to my studies in A Course in Miracles. Some things agree but a lot do not (which does not invalidate his experiences).
1423140605|5.0|I bought The Mark of Athena for my daughter and she can not put it down! Any book that can hold my active 11-year-old's attention like that is definitely worth getting. I can't wait to read it myself, but I guess I'll have to wait in line! Thank you Rick Riordan!
B009FZZFME|4.0|Very exciting with hand to hand combat smashing zombies left and right.<br /><br />Lori Grimes, Sara Callies died while giving birth to Shane's or Rick's potentially zombie child. She mustered enough strength so that Carl will know how important it is for him to be a vanguard of humanity against the zombies in a Wild Fire world. She died with her boots on.<br /><br />Carl, a brave young man shoots his mom in the head so she won't have zombie karma.<br /><br />IronE died bravely like a real man  while saving Carol from being dinner. He died like a man with his boots on.<br /><br />Then there were none. Herschel must stay the course for this show to survive.He is the MVP of this series since Shane's demise. On Herschel's broad shoulders and peg leg (he'll have one) rest the fortunes of The Walking Dead. Shane's ghost would be a plus. He was a complete character, a scum-bag and good person.<br /><br />Rick is going to be musing about the credentials of the new born. And if the infant is a zombie without teeth at this point in time.<br /><br />This show is absurd. Ridicuous. It is real good. Exciting.
B0091QS88K|1.0|Its the wort game ever!!!!! you haves to drag every thing!don't play this game.who ever made this game is werid!!!this is my review don't play this game please!!!!!!!!!!!
B001EQ5ZJK|4.0|Dr. Lipton's exposure about the influences of our \\"environment\\" on our health and wellness is presented in a manner that a lay person, as myself, can explore w/o getting entangled with medical and scientific technicalities / jagons.  His thesis that our health and wellness does not have to be dictated by our DNA is both promising and plausible. I look forward to reading other books by Dr. Bruce Lipton soon.
B0074V33MK|5.0|Beautifully written and moving to the last word! It leaves you with hope. Eric Lomax passed away recently and this book was mentioned in his obituary. The words Brutality and Forgiveness in the same sentence made me curious to read it.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|Love this movie. Tom Cruise is the best. All star cast and great music. Ive watched it twice already and counting. Loved it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is fun although you have to earn all the other games. i have had it for about one day now and i like it a lot!
1451620829|3.0|I always thought that Gene was the biggest selfish egomaniac in KISS...But I was wrong. Peter's ego is ten time bigger!! And remember that everything who went wrong in is life was the fault of someone else!!! I gave 3* juste because this book made me laugh a lot...Yes Peter you made me laugh, but not for the good reasons!!
B00729GQ0A|3.0|Rebecca is an amazing writer. Her way with words is almost as magical as the story that she tells. I cannot believe that this is her first novel! The story starts in a backwater town located in the mountains and the protagonist is Sophia. The story is told by her and she reminds me so much of myself. She is whimsical, funny but vulnerable.<br />I do not want to spoil the fun. By revealing too much, but be rest assured the Rebecca Hamilton hits a home run with Forever Girl. I heard about the misleading hype that Forever Girl is a rehash of The Twilight series. That is so wrong.<br />Yes, it is a fantasy book with mythical creatures and including vampires.  But does that make it a Twilight copy-cat? This book is not filled with the cupid fluff of Twilight. There are way more supernatural creatures than vampires too.<br />The author tries very hard to tell a good story and frankly speaking I think the author overdelivered with this one!  Remember the name Rebecca Hamilton guys. This is definitely one for the future!
B0099G7KDQ|4.0|Great album....  Doesn't disappoint.  I was worried it wouldn't live up to the last album, but it does and offers more.
B0056AP65I|5.0|This is an inexpensive and very nice all metal set. If you have sat on a plastic barrel pencil you will know the value of a metal leadholder. I do have a concern however. As an artist I generally require archival(non-fading) colors, and as no information is given, I may decide to fill each with a different hardness of standard graphite. In either case the set is great. The sharpeners are obviously intended for fieldwork away from the drawing table lead pointer; since the set can fit in a pocket and has a durable metal case this is somthing I will carry around.
B0092R66T6|4.0|Being a fan of ST and having read the book many years ago, it's great to see this  forward adaptation come to life. I enjoyed the story very much and the characters are well written. While not the best movie out, it's really good if your into Starship Troopers.  I gave it 4 stars because of the suprising entertainment value I got out of it.  Much much more than expected.
0375507256|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the pre/post-apocalytic novel.  If you are looking for a story with an unusual plot dynamic, that is written-well, and has distinct, fleshed-out characters, this is the novel to read.  Moreover, it's one that really makes a reader think.  I have the paperback form of the novel and also the audio version.  The audio was awesome and had different actors reading the various stories -  I would encourage you to get the audio format for the full effect of the characterizations, various dialogues and dialects.
B0098VYKSA|2.0|I got this thinking that it was going to be a really good movie and was very disappointed at the acting in this movie. I did like the special effects and did manage to finish the movie, but the story felt rushed, crammed and almost lost at times. Over all the movie is ok, at best it could get 3 stars... Not for me though.
B002GSXKN8|5.0|Came on time and in great condition. All the movies were great and the kids loved them. Definately recommmend it for snow days!
B007Y36K46|4.0|If your even thinking about watching this, DO IT.  One of the most suprising films out in my opinion.  I went into this not understanding anything about it.<br /><br />The entertainment is very high.<br />The acting is appropriate and fun to watch.<br />The effects are very good<br />The whole film closes well and leaves you hoping for more!<br /><br />Good watch and I personally am glad  I own this film.
B009MZQQWA|5.0|I bought this because we have started a tradition of having the RHPS night around Halloween each year.  The movie is bizarre, of course, but always a fun classic for a Halloween party.  Visit the RHPS website for information on props (toast, rice, confetti, etc.) to throw during the movie. It makes it so much more fun!
B00932A2MC|4.0|I wasn't sure what exactly to expect when I decided to watch this move.  I decided to give it 4 stars because of its entertainment value.  While the movie can be cheesy at times, I rather enjoyed the story, effects and entertainment as a whole.  I have watched this movie 4 times now and it's still as enjoyable as the first time.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Runs great on my Kindle Fire.....I use it all the time! Connects easily to my Facebook and computer.....love it!!!!!!! Enjoy the ease of use
B004PVKFR8|4.0|I was skeptical before getting this album, but it's turned out to be one of my favorites.<br /><br />The lyrics are great<br />The music is enjoyable<br />There are many good songs on this album<br /><br />If you give it full listen, you will love this album.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|i am so enjoying this book... changes your mindset about what creativity is and should be... my students are now reading this book... simple, precise, good read.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|Pretty good move, I just didn't think that it was enjoyable since I couldn't relate to everything going on.  The movie has great entertainment value and great music.  Overall a good movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The most helpful review said it best, but the ending left room for a part 2. Very good book altogether.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Loved this movie and how it stays huge invoke in the movie.  It's not believeable and that's ok because it's the AVENGERS.  I enjoyed the plot, the humor in all the characters the way it comes together and the way the story closes. I think the special effects are top notch as well.  Overall this movie did not disappoint at all.  Love it and will happily watch again.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this is a cool game i think people should play ckeck it out and rate but i think terry and mark should  try out
B009VSW15Y|5.0|So far so good..  Just purchased, but so far it is easy to use and<br />worked within 20 seconds of purchase.. Will certainly enhance my fire hd experience!!!!
B009C7JS14|5.0|Easy to read current local weather...no scrolling required. Screen opens to show hourly forecast for chosen or current location along with pertinent info.. improvement would be to add 5 day but app is best for current ~ 24 hr weather.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Nice twist to an I resting story. Kept me reading at a fast pace wondering where he was going next.
B000S0DDG0|5.0|I love this movie.  I've watched it at least 5 times and it still makes me cry.  I Love Jennifer Hudson
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a great free app. it has so many different difficulty levels and it pulls you in for hours on end.
B003EVFHYG|5.0|Never seen the movie, the soundtrack is top notch and VERY original. A combination of many styles and sounds, worth every penny.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The history is accurate, the characters believable, a great ride through the stupid slaughter of WW I.<br />Looking forward to the rest of the triology.
B007MS5B6Q|4.0|The zombie head case for the DVD of season 2 was excellent. Lift the head to access the DVDs is great, go art work, I would recommend this for any fan of the walking dead series
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Very happy with my purchase.will be buying another as a Christmas gift. Wish you had an orange one with a San Francisco Giants logo on it!
B007FEZQF8|3.0|The art work is amazing! Also the comic is different to the TV show in many respects. I loved reading the comic but the only thing that stops me buying the next issue...the cost. £5.22 is a bit too pricey for me. Drop the price a bit and I'd probably consider buying more of them. The price is the reason why I'm only giving it 3 stars out of 5.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I like the layout, but many of the pins take FOREVER to load....or do not load at all. Fix that and it is great!
B004J4WN0I|4.0|A level below the Dresden files, but quite well done. The main character has some smart ass commentry like Harry does.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|The title seemed derivitive. However, after about two minutes with the game, I was enjoying the original aesthetic and thoughtful power ups.
B002LAM7PI|5.0|This is my 2 year old granddaughters take on this movie, she loves it!  She loved it so much I had to buy another copy for my house because she took the first one home.  It's dark but there is a good story which she may not understand yet but I'm sure she will soon.  I highly recommend this movie to any age group, as long as the child isn't easily scared.  By the way my 1 yr old grandson like this too, mostly for the kitty in it!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This was my first Jack Reacher novel, but it won't be my last. The book was really hard to put down and I finished it in record time.<br /><br />This is not to say that it is perfect. I found several plot holes, one or two big, and the rest small. Reacher's logic for making some of his kills in the way he did flew in the face of reason, and his weapons of choice were also a bit odd. I put this down to an inexperienced author who has no prior knowledge in this area. I also question whether anyone in the book, good or bad, would have been as blood-thirty in real life as the author portrayed them.<br /><br />All in all, The Killing Floor was very good an well worth reading.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|love this game until I opened it today and all my progress had been reset. I was on mission 30.
B004V5A7K8|3.0|The game plays well on my kindle, but I found the game very non challenging.  I went through the first 10 levels with only 1 miss, and I expect the game to get harder as the levels progress, but thus one doesn't.  I must have had 10 free balls at this point and quit because I was bored with it.
1401324649|4.0|\\"The 100 Year Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared,\\" by Jonas Jonasson is a fun story about a feisty old man named Allan. It is interesting how Mr. Jonasson weaves in history of the 20th century into Allan's life, with famous events and people. He is a strong writer that gives the reader just enough detail to imagine the story perfectly. The plot and sub-plots are woven nicely together as well as the chapters being separated by past and present to timeline Mr. Allan's fascinating life. I get apprehensive sometimes when authors try to write famous people in fiction, but surprisingly Mr. Jonasson's interpretations did not bother me. I definitely recommend this read.
0316228532|1.0|First off, I did not buy this, but rather borrowed it from the library.  Never would have given a thought to reading it based on the little I had heard about it, except for the Potter books.  I am finding this story boring and uninteresting.  Was going to give it at least 100 pages, but think I am done at 79.
0345803493|5.0|My sister and i fell in love with the book we strated reading them backwards but well worth it great
B009RI4ZKC|1.0|Not for kids, not for adults... creepy at points ( I won't elaborate, let's just say it harkens back to the 'educational' episode of DIfferent Strokes).  Sorry Bill Murray was in this - what a waste of talent.
0345803485|5.0|Love it very interesting evryone would love this book me and my sister trade them off so we can both enjoy
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is # 1 of my game list cause this game is so awesome I swear to yo word up
B003QNXPUK|3.0|Comes off occasionally and has some difficulty sticking on the product though I applied it perfectly. ZAGG is excellent at sending replacements though. Because its so thick, accumulkates temporary indents on the top  like when a nail or a key in your pocket rests on or touches it. Would probably not buy again

B008WCP2PG|3.0|Here's The Lowedown on \\"Magic Mike\\" (A Drama/Dance DVD review)...liked it!<br /><br />Genre: 7 Movie: 7<br /><br />Become a fan of \\"The Lowedown\\" on Facebook<br /><br />What's it about?<br />Mike, an experienced stripper, takes a younger performer called The Kid under his wing and schools him in the arts of partying, picking up women, and making easy money.<br /><br />What did I think?<br />Once you get passed all the pevis in your face male stripper stuff, the movie had a story that I liked.  It reminded me of \\"Cocktail\\" at first, but had a little \\"Boogie Nights\\" at the end that was keeping me interested.  Unfortunately, they ended it to soon.  I would have liked to see the magic continue. I can't say it's worth buying, but I would rent it with a handful of 1's.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I never heard of Pinterest until I played the logos game.  I thought I'd give it a try. Now it's part of my daily routine.  I like the idea of creating what I consider is my own 'tailored for me' magazine. It's also introduced me to websites and blogs I probably never would have found and enjoyed.
B007L6VR12|3.0|Here's The Lowedown on \\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" (A Comedy/Romance DVD review)...It was ok.<br />Genre: 8.5 Movie: 5<br /><br />Become a fan of \\"The Lowedown\\" on Facebook.<br /><br />What's it about?<br />Set on an island off the coast of New England in the 1960s, as a young boy and girl fall in love they are moved to run away together. Various factions of the town mobilize to search for them and the town is turned upside down -- which might not be such a bad thing.<br /><br />What did I think?<br />This is classic Wes Anderson work...it's too bad I am not a fan of Wes Anderson.  I gave it high marks, as it was a great film, But I found it odd and difficult to follow.  Not like \\"Inception\\", as I wanted to watch that one a second time...I just wanted this one out of my player.  If you are a fan of Anderson's work (\\"The Royal Tanenbaums\\", \\"Rushmore\\", and \\"Life Aquatic\\" are examples), then you will love this movie.  I will leave it in the store for you.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Rock of Ages was absolutely not one of Tom Cruise's best performances. He should stick to doing other roles that do not require singing. Certainly would not recommend this to anyone. Don't waste your time or money!!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This simple app features easy timesetting, several different alarm saves and loads of different ringtones for alarms. Very helpful free app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy these games. they are very entertaining and addictive. I like how you have to earn points to get new games, it makes it worth playing.
B001JRB16U|5.0|What a fabulous DVD. An age old story that I love to share over and over again with my granddaughter. It is truly wonderful and so nice to be able to put it on whenever she wants to watch it.

B00005JNS0|5.0|Such a great movie, in fact almost more detail and drawn more perfectly than its sequel (which I love too but that one seems to be more computerized).
B009NZQDW2|5.0|This movie Is as of now one of my all time favorites to watch. Should have bought it not just rented

B00913DPW2|5.0|This was a really good game and I enjoyed playing it although some of the puzzles were hard (thankfully there were hints and a walkthough!)I couldn't put this down and stayed up way too late trying to solve this. Great graphics too.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|The DVD arrived in perfect condition! Was a great purchase! Thanks and I will enjoy this movie for years to come!

0312430000|3.0|Atul Gawande does a great job of conveying the importance and usefulness of checklists in the real world. Unfortunately, his examples do not span a wide variety of applications and he does not provide detailed instructions on creating good checklists. He offers advice about what makes a good checklist throughout, but the book would seem much more complete if he had added a guide in the appendix. Instead, he shows the few examples that he had written about, at length, within the text. Overall, a very informative text that is worth the read.

1451613512|1.0|I took some courses in college that dealt with the Cold War from an almost exclusively left wing perspective in which Harry Truman was The Great Satan. That's the same approach taken by the authors of this book.  Access to Soviet archives has changed most sane people's perspectives since the 1970's, but that excludes Stone and Kuznick.  Historian Ronald Radosh's review of this book noticed the same thing and it is is illuminating. He said:<br /><br />\\"But half a century ago, when I was in high school, the late Carl Marzani told this very story in We Can Be Friends. A secret member of the American Communist party who had worked during the war in the OSS, Marzani later was proved by evidence from Soviet archives and Venona decryptions to have been a KGB (then the NKVD) operative. His book was published privately by his own Soviet-subsidized firm. It was the first example of what came to be called \\"Cold War revisionism.\\" Quoting the memoirs of figures from the Roosevelt and Truman administrations, as well as newspaper stories and magazine articles, Marzani aimed to show that the Cold War had been started by the Truman administration with the intent of destroying a peaceful alliance with the Soviet Union and gaining American hegemony throughout the world.<br /><br />As it happens, Marzani could have provided Stone's interpretation of how the Cold War began. Over and over, Stone uses the same quotations, the same arrangements of material, and the same arguments as Marzani. This is not to accuse Stone of plagiarism, only to point out that the case he now offers as new was argued in exactly the same terms by an American Communist and Soviet agent in 1952.\\"<br /><br />No. I'm not accusing Stone or Kuznick of being communists. I doubt that either of them has the courage of his ostensible convictions that would be necessary to be  a communist.

B009NQKPUW|2.0|I'm still trying to figure out if the big reveal had any implications for the plot. I couldn't generate much sympathy for the characters as they weren't very fully developed. I think this is the last Ridley Scott effort I'll need to see.

B008PE9GSA|3.0|I have said to my music friends that it is hard for the older groups still making music to actually continue to make good music. ZZ Top falls into this category. They have been around forever (I started listening to them in 1974). My expectations were low upon buying the cd (had to have it though as I am a fan). I did buy it rather quickly after it came out. I was interested in the content as I knew that Rick Rubin was producing - I was hoping the results would be similiar to what Frank Zappa did with Grand Funk's Good Singin', Good Playin'.<br /><br />Upon first listen I was not impressed. However, this can sometimes be a sign of good things to come. Sure enough the cd began to grow on me. It has the ZZ rawness that we have come to expect. Yes, it does have some of the worn out lead licks from Billy. Speaking of Billy, this guy has still got it. Saw ZZ this summer and he is as good as he has ever been (shows seem to be getting shorter and shorter however).<br /><br />The songs became more catchy and interesting the more I listened to it. Some have complained about the brevity of the cd (10 songs) but I like it in that most of the songs are good with some even being strong.<br /><br />The cd can't really touch the early classic cds but that is almost to be expected. I would like to see the tour supporting the cd. Songs like I Gotsta Get Paid, Chartreuse, and Have a Little Mercy would fit well with their better known songs.
0307742997|5.0|This story is about a number of unsolved, sadistic murders in Norway, Oslo area. The principal character's dialogues are often followed with his deeper thoughts echoing his country's problems with the family breakdown, promiscuity, political apathy. The detective's generally gloomy outlook on life is almost a mirror image of the November grey skies full of rain and early snow. The novel is quite interesting in spite of a large number of unsolved murder cases, in spite of its exaggerations of the killer's sadism and ingenuity. Such are fairly rare in real life. They reminded me of `The Silence of the Lambs,' Jeffrey Dahmer, Ted Bundy...<br />Steven Nedelton<br />Author of Fear!
B0091REZMW|3.0|I strongly dislike having to &quot;buy&quot; with real money anything in a game that is mandatory to advance in the game. I also don't like having to share with others anything that again is 'mandatory' to advance in the game. I believe that once a game is purchased one should be able to play the game to its fullest extent and enjoy its challenges without having to find other people to exchange 'parts' with. Energy and diamonds run out quickly and must be purchased in order to further play the game. Change these dynamics and 5 stars would be well deserved!
B008KW43TE|5.0|I was randomly listening to music to see what can be played in my car. Stumbled across Channel Orange liked how it sounded, so I bought it. I LOVE THE WAY FRANK PAINTS MENTAL PICTURES AS HE SINGS!!! The album ROCKS! DON'T SLEEP ON THIS TALENTED MAN.

B0070NSPCU|3.0|I liked the writting but missed more character depth, and definitly a more fast paced story. There where good elements inside, such as the blood song theme, but they really left it too much aside. They should have focused more on that because at least it was a more  innovative idea, but in the end you  only saw flickers of it through the story,<br /><br />Maybe book two will be morel ike this should

B00A04BKA0|5.0|Dr Alexander contracted a unique severe brain infection of his outer brain that totally incapacitated his memory, ability to think or even hallucinate putting him into a life-threatening coma for a week. Confirmation of this condition is included in the form of an independent statement from his attending physician.<br /><br />During this time his consciousness persisted and he found himself in a very exalted realm which he was able to describe in careful notes he took during his recovery. Prior to this experience his worldview was similar to physicians and scientists who consider \\"consciousness isn't really worth worrying about because it is just a by-product of physical processes. Many scientists go further, saying that not only is consciousness a secondary phenomenon, but that in addition, it's not even real.\\" That is, he doubted and ignored any study of the NDE phenomena because it was \\"impossible.\\"<br /><br />His experience changed all that. In retrospect he considers his own NDE \\"was a technically near-impeccable near-death experience, perhaps one of the most convincing cases in modern history.\\" His brain function was so far gone that he would have had no sense of personal identity or ability to fantasize and his recovery so complete that he was able to retain all his medical knowledge. In light of this experience vis-à-vis his expertise he considers it his personal duty to reeducate the population in general and the medical community in particular.<br /><br />In his new found enlightenment, he found freedom, knowledge, loving acceptance and vistas that he would never have imagined possible using the constraints of his earth brain. \\"Up there, a question would arise in my mind, and the answer would arise at the same time, like a flower coming up right next to it. It was almost as if, just as no physical particle in the universe is really separate from another, so in the same way there was no such thing as a question without an accompanying answer. These answerswere not simple \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" fare, either. They were vast conceptual edifices, staggering structures of living thought, as intricate as cities. Ideas so vast they would have taken me lifetimes to find my way around if I had been confined to earthly thought. But I wasn't. I had sloughed off that earthly style of thought like a butterfly breaking from a chrysalis.\\"<br /><br />\\"To experience thinking outside the brain is to enter a world of instantaneous connections that make ordinary thinking (i.e., those aspects limited by the physical brain and the speed of light) seem like some hopelessly sleepy and plodding event. Our truest, deepest self is completely free. It is not crippled or compromised by past actions or concerned with identity or status. It comprehends that it has no need to fear the earthly world, and therefore, it has no need to build itself up through fame or wealth or conquest.\\"<br /><br />As a neurologist, the author knew how convincing hallucinations (\\"neuronal phantasmagoria\\") could be as they were happening, but also knew just how evident they would be after the fact when the mind was clear again. \\"But while I was in coma my brain hadn't been working improperly. It hadn't been working at all. The part of my brain that years of medical school had taught me was responsible for creating the world I lived and moved in and for taking the raw data that came in through my senses and fashioning it into a meaningful universe: that part of my brain was down, and out. And yet despite all of this, I had been alive, and aware, truly aware, in a universe characterized above all by love, consciousness, and reality...There was, for me, simply no arguing this fact. I knew it so completely that I ached.\\" \\"I was blind, but now I see\\" took on a new meaning for the author.<br /><br />\\"I was completely free of my bodily identity... How did I gain from not remembering my earthly self? It allowed me to go deep into realms beyond the worldly without having to worry aboutwhat I was leaving behind. Throughout my entire time in those worlds, I was a soul with nothing to lose. No places to miss, no people to mourn... I was allowed to die harder, and travel deeper, than almost all NDE subjects before me... the only pain and heartache I felt was when I had to return to earth, where I'd begun.\\"<br /><br />The author has a valuable story to tell unless you choose to shut down your own brain and decide to dismiss him as a nut case whose brain spent too much time soaking in pus, the traditional medical model at its zenith.<br /><br />The book is indexed and includes a six-page reading list.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book was a somewhat underwhelming conclusion to a series that had been exciting and interesting up to this point. No qualms with my purchase or with the book quality etc obviously, except I noticed a few more typos than usual. I would recommend it only to those who have read the first 2 and who absolutely have to know how it ends, but honestly I feel the same way as I do about the matrix trilogy, if you've seen the first one, just use your imagination to conjure up what happens next, as the premise set up at the end is let down by the actual conclusion.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|Thrilling and amazingly written, a bit too fast paced in places but an amazing read none the less, would definitely recommend.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have been using this for several months (including prior versions) and love it. It is so easy to type and it quickly learns your style and picks your next word for you. Very accurate once you use it for a few days.

B005QI4TP8|5.0|One of the better albums I have heard in a long time.  Blows the first album out of the water!  Florence Welch has an amazing voice.  \\"What The Water Gave Me\\" is the best thing to happen to my ears in a long time.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Disappointed with the ending.  The book dragged on and on, so it seemed  as if Flynn just got tired of writing and decided to stop, mid-thought.  I don't think it was a bad book, I simply expected more after all of the rave reviews.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I liked it, well written. Not as great as part one, but still kept me on the edge of my seat towards the middle to end.
B002PJ8BE6|5.0|Note: This is the same review that was posted under the MP3 version but didn't get transferred to the CD version.<br /><br />I am in total agreement with Mr. Moore's review, especially on one point. Jonas Kaufmann is a splendid tenor whose voice and style best suit the German side of the repertoire rather than the Italian. But I feel this new \\"Butterfly\\" should be put into perspective. The recorded sound is impeccable; Pappano's conducting is as good as any on disc. Gheorghiu's voice and style suit Cio-Cio San very well. Is she the vocal equal of Leontyne Price in this role or the dramatic equal of Callas, Freni, Scotto, and de los Angeles? No, but she comes blessedly close. Looking back over the past twenty years, I'd pick her ovr any rivals. The warmth, intimacy, and femininity of her protrayal remind me of Anna Moffo.<br /><br />So many of the ingredients needed for a successful opera recording are present here, and they mesh so well, that I can begrudge Pinkerton his (minor) faults. After all, Kaufmann's voice is strong, well placed, ringing on top, and musically applied. Those qualities count for a lot, especially in the absence of a rising Italian tenor who might better him. (Villazon is tied up with a rival company, of course.) Ramon Vargas and Marcello Alvarez come closer to the timbre of a true Puccini tenor, I suppose, but I think Kaufmann surpasses them in dramatic passion and electricity.

B00979CS50|5.0|Album is terrific. While all the songs are stellar, Ramada Inn really stands out as a \\"the\\" showstopper that rocks while filling you with emotion. While this album is great, I gotta say that the live versions of Walk Like A Giant, Ramada Inn, Twisted Road (acoustic so far), Psychedelic Pill, etc. are better. Get the album, but check out the live stuff too.
B000MQ560Q|4.0|Sound Quality:<br /><br />Stellar! It was amazing to hear this on vinyl. I first started my DM obsession when this album had come out, so I know it backwards and forwards. The subtleties and nuances are truly special.<br />I feel that it's the music feeling more 'present'. The mids! They were missing from the CD experience.<br /><br />Vinyl:<br /><br />180g so it is heavy. The labels are black with the purple SOFAD writing.<br /><br />Packaging:<br /><br />Gatefold - left inner is black background with notes from Daniel Miller about this period of DM's career.<br />  right inner is black background, purple DM letters, lyrics to all songs, and credits.<br /><br />Inner Sleeve - 1 whole side is just black, the other side has B&W Anton Corbijn pics taken from the SOFAD era.<br /><br />I have 3 gripes about this re-packaging:<br /><br />1. The gatefold is so nice, only to be somewhat ruined by the left side being a paragraph written by Daniel Miller lamenting about the tough times that the band were going through when this album was originally made.<br />  Pictures would've been the way to go on the inside cover, with the paragraph being smaller. I mean, this is the super-duper edition and you waste half of the inner gatefold with information that is well documented?<br /><br />2. I have the 180g issue of Black Celebration, and the inner sleeve is paper, with the lyrics. The SOFAD inner sleeve is not paper, but cardboard, and it isn't lined. This can damage the record over time.<br />  I paid a good chunk of change for this record, and it's the collector-limited-release-end-all-be-all version. You guys can't include a poly-lined record sleeve?<br /><br />3. One WHOLE side of the inner sleeve is just black? You couldn't put other pictures there? this is a tragic waste of space, and there are certainly enough pictures from this period in DM's career to fill up both sides.<br /><br />My 3 gripes prevent me from rating this 5 stars, but it is definitely a great record, and I'm glad I have it. Now onto Violator...I'm glad I have it. Now onto Violator...

B009R6GN22|5.0|I have always been intrigued by the life of Marilyn Monroe but have never read any books about her.  I put off reading anything because there were so many to choose from, I didn't know where to start.  A few weeks ago I did a search on Amazon and came upon Marilyn Monroe: The Biography by Donald Spoto.  It had so many good reviews, and it was relatively new, so I decided to go with it.  I knew before starting, that the book went into great detail about Marilyn's life and that this was wonderful for some people and not so much for others.  I have to tell you, from the moment I started this book I was hopelessly hooked!  It started telling a little about the lives of her great grandparents, grandparents, her mother and then very much into her early childhood and life.  To me, this detail was delicious in every respect because I really wanted to know her background and how maybe she came to the life she lived and it gave me that in spades.  This book is not full of sensationalism and made up wonderment about her, but simply (or not so simply) the facts of her life and for yourself you can see how and why some things turned out the way they did.  This man did great, deep research into her life and is evident by his long list at the end of the book of his resources.  Though this book is filled with facts, it's presented in a way that will intrigue you and by the end, if you had not already, you will feel that Marilyn could have been your friend and also realize that she had so few.  So if you are a Marilyn Monroe fan, this is the book for you.  I recommend it highly.  You will come away even more interested in her for the woman she was, feel for her for the woman she became, and admire her for what she endured.  I loved this book and hated for it to end.<br />I feel that no other book about her would come even close to being as good as this one.

B005MHHREI|4.0|The book is a methodical well documented history of the improbable success of a man who set out at an early age to obtain totalitarian power. His progress toward that goal is a huge chess game with every move costing the lives of many people, many of whom were his nominal allies. The authors quote early on from a journal kept by Mao in which he at age 18 describes his philosophy, which is that anything that helps me is good and anything that doesn't help me is bad. The rest of the book shows how he lived out that philosophy at the expense of the deaths of wives and supposed comrades among the seventy million people who were killed by him or by his policies according to the authors' estimates.
B0063IH60K|5.0|overall a basic solitaire game. works well with no problems. would get again<br />there are somethings that are annoying about it, like when you click a card it tries to go to the aces deck first no matter what, but that's my only complaint.

030758836X|5.0|I loved this book. It was fast paced with lots of twists and it ends entirely different than I anticipated. I enjoy when a novelist can keep you guessing for so long. Knowing what your partner in marriage is truly thinking is hard to know and this book plays on that.  Read this, you will not regret it.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I am very familiar with the MMORPGs and this book gives a lot of great ideas about future possibilities with a very entertaining twist. It was a blast to read. Also the plot was excellent. Once you pick up this book, it is very difficult to stop.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|\\"A Wanted Man,\\" in my opinion, is one of Child's best in the Reacher series. It is definitely worth the purchase. I would recommend it to any Reacher fan, as well as anyone looking for a good action/mystery read. READ IT!
B000L212HC|5.0|movie was exciting to watch no dull let's stay awake parts.  very cleverly done, didn't catch the prestige untill the very end, even though it was given to you in the opening credits. very good movie.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|You need to start at the beginning with \\"Highlander\\". It starts a little slow, but becomes amazing and riveting, book after book.  Love this series!
B003O86FMW|2.0|I do not recommend this book.  Unless you like things that are personal, and not the action parts, I would not buy this book.  You know, I liked the hunger games series only because of the games and the training.  Well, this book is three fourth Katniss's life and only one fourth action.  It is very boring.  Plus the game part was too short and undetailed.  As I have said in my title, do not buy this book and / or read it unless you can get it for free.  Do not trust kindle books, because they leave stuff out and have errors.  Also, PLEASE comment on my review.  I love criticism.
B0098VXE50|4.0|Very good cinematography; very well drawn characters.<br />All the actors were superb, especially Charlize Theron.<br />The design was very well done.  An entertaining and<br />different version of the classic story.  I liked it very<br />much.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|In order to appreciate this CD you must first understand what Neil Young is attempting to do. He has taken a representative collection of traditional American songs, and he has transformed them. It is a radical de-construction; \\"radical\\" not in terms of political leanings, but radical in that the transformation is complete, one-hundred percent, total. These songs have been de-constructed. The musical elements have been torn apart, thrown up in the air, and have been put back together from the pieces found on the floor. The result is still makes musical sense. The de-construction is made more complete by the droning of NY's Les Paul and the dutiful backing of Crazy Horse.<br /><br />Why this deconstruction? My guess, based on NY's political proclivities, is that the American dream has been so mangled and twisted the events from 2008 to the present, that the sentiment behind these once-idyllic traditional songs are now a contorted mess, a shadow of their former selves, deformed by recent events. This is only a guess. It could also be that NY, the grandfather of Grunge, wanted to make a grunge version of traditional American songs.<br /><br />Whatever the interpretation, the CD is remarkable because it contains the original, unsanitized version of Woody Guthrie's \\"This Land is Your Land.\\" That original version contained lines talking about the privatization of public land, unemployment lines and hunger. These lines have been excised, almost since the inception of this song, by others wanting to render their own version of the song, from Burl Ives and others.<br /><br />This CD is well worth a listen.

0446547646|5.0|A classic love story...forbiden love. \\"The best of me\\" is a book that  anyone that can relate to a love that can't be but you can't forget....this is your book.  This book will turned your heart inside and out....make you wonder what is truthly love...and how even time,people or space can't separate you from your true love......it reminded me of my love.....Jenny.....my endless love.
B006LSZECO|4.0|\\"Diabolical\\" is the word that comes to mind.  Flynn makes good use of switching first-person points of view and other gimmicks to craft a first-rate psychological thriller. This is not the book to read if you like your thriller/mysteries tidy. Its plot twists and turns and borders on the outlandish--and you'll either love or hate the ending. It's a stunning, uncomfortable dissection of a disintegrating marriage and the sociopathic mind. Definitely not a book you'd want to give as a wedding gift...
B00338QENI|4.0|This book has been coming up on my computer screen as a \\"new for you\\" reading suggestion for well over a year.  I finally purchased the kindle version and I am happy that I did.  This was such a great story.  It wasn't just about science and cell cultures, it was about a family.  I did cry through a few parts (I was in line waiting to early vote and started sniveling quietly through one of them), but I did laugh through a few others. I wish the Lacks family well and am glad the author took her time and got the story right.

B009DJB9HC|5.0|I got into this group last year after getting really into Glenn Hughes' solo albums. I bought the first album...loved it. Bought the second album and Live Over Europe...loved 'em. Then I heard about a third release and immediately pre-ordered it. I received my copy a few days before the street release and gave it a few listens. I really enjoyed all the tracks. They really rock out on the single Confessor. I also really loved the next track Cry Freedom. Glenn and Joe's voice go very well together. It would be a shame if this is their last effort because this band is really something special. So get off your ass and pick this album up. It's worth every cent.

B0094OLJD0|4.0|Not a review, folks, but a question to you Ph.D.s in Annieclarkology. What are the two protuberances on the right (viewer's left) side of her face? Could that be her tongue in her cheek? No, not unless it's forked. I own music by both Clark and Byrne, but I'm not a super-in-the-know fan, and I can't make out what I'm seeing in this 2-shot. Any help?
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Kathy Reichs's books are always a good read.  She keeps the story going.  Her descriptions of the characters make the reader react just as she intends.  If the character is annoying, the reader is annoyed.  Fantastic.  This story was fascinating.  I hadn't read anything about these diamond mines but I will now.  I hope Reichs continues to write - a lot.  I will purchase every book.
0316228532|2.0|This book was the opposite of HP.  Instead of read-through-the-night exciting story, there was none.  In place of characters who were clearly good or horribly evil, everyone was grey.<br /><br />I read the detailed character developments for the first 100+ pages, waiting for the plot, waiting for something (anything) to happen.  In the end, it was the ordinariness of everything that made the book so disappointing.  I didn't love any of the characters, yet couldn't quite hate most of them either.  The lack of story-line was  an insurmountable hurdle to enjoying.<br /><br />I wanted to love it.  I admire JKR for writing something in no way related to HP.  But I hope she goes back to HP-style books in the future.
B00913DPW2|5.0|This was a great game. My husband and I enjoyed trying to solve the puzzles together. Best part is Igot it for free!!! Now I have to buy The Hau<br />nt 2!!!

B004HNTER6|5.0|this is not just a gear head car story. It is a personal telling of a super man, who fights his way on the track and off to be the best in his field, Formula One Racing. The real time footage is bone chilling, the politics are complicated but told well and in detail, so you are with Aryton Senna from his go-cart days to the height of his racing career and 3 world championships. The personal story is much bigger than the cars, and it is a story that is relevant and interesting even if you have no real interest in cars or car racing. FIVE STARS

B008PWUWLC|3.0|The Timbuk2 Gripster Jacket does what it says and gets the job done but I was disappointed when the product arrived in the mail.<br /><br />I guess the marketing department was guilty of overkill as they raised my expectations too far. When this Kindle Fire protective jacket was promoted as a stand I thought it was like other Kindle jackets that act as a stand and it is not. But the fabric cover is of high quality but is short on padding. The gray texture with blue color trim and beige panel is very attractive.<br /><br />The Tombuk2 Gripster does offer scratch and impact protection and, like my Kindle keyboard reader jacket folds back for a comfortable flat grip when reading. I like that. The material does grip on surfaces when you open it completely when you want it to function as a stand, once you find the correct position. It claims to stand at any angel with no slip but that's problematical.<br /><br />At $35 I find the Timbuk2 Gripster overpriced.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Burton, Depp, pure win, solid gold, my new favorite funny movie.<br /><br />If you havent seen it you really should, it is a must own.
034580404X|5.0|Love, love, love this book! A good read hope the author comes out with more novels because this trilogy blew me away
0439023491|5.0|I'm NOT a big reader. The last time I read a series of books was Harry Potter (mind you I couldn't get past book 5). But this book was simply captivating.<br /><br />I started the series by watching the first movie. I had no clue what this hunger games deal was all about. The movie was so phenomenal that I HAD to start reading the books before the other movies came out. The first book took me some time to read. I think that was because I already knew what was going to happen. But as soon as I picked up this book, I was done in a flash!<br /><br />I really can't say much about the story. It's just that amazing. I'm already reading Mockingjay now!
B003VANOFY|5.0|Amazing headset, the 7.1 surround is just awesome. gaming sounds like foot steps and gun fire are easy to tell what direction there coming from. I'm told my voice comes through loud and clear with the mic.<br /><br />The only thing you should remember is to update your drivers from logitechs web site or you may have issues with the mic echoing your voice back at you.
B008NABUU8|4.0|Excellent use of graphics. By far the best bridge builder I've played.  Touch controls are not alalways responsive on original kindle fire, but its still very enjoyable.
098478280X|5.0|I bought this book 2 weeks prior to interviewing for post-undergrad computer engineering gig. There is not 1 interview question I was asked that is not in this book. If anything, the book has more advanced forms of the questions that I received. I am told the best way to interview is to practice interviews, but this is the best alternative and complement.
B008XOXGL0|5.0|I bought the vinyl version of this because I'm a hipster like that, and despite this being a fanTASTIC piece of music I was a little disappointed by the LP package. But the music...<br /><br />\\"Radioactive\\" is not a representative track to start the album because it grinds heavier than the rest of the album, but with that said I like it equally to any other track. Apparently the radio hits are \\"This Time\\" and \\"Demons\\" and I guess I can see why, although really any song on this record is stashed with enough hooks to keep any DJ happy. I myself am more of a 20-minute Rush song kind of guy, so music doesn't really grip me if the lyrics resemble the cringe-worthy pop variety; Imagine Dragons does pass my test with a solid B. While I may never know the exact circumstances behind the songs, I can at least emotionally get behind some of the words in tunes like \\"Demons\\" and \\"Amsterdam\\".<br /><br />People often compare Imagine Dragons to fun. But wait you say, fun is a pop band and ID is a rock band. Yeah, but I would say ID is definitely a hybrid and they're both kinda indie. The important point is that Night Visions will make you want to stop cleaning your room and dance for 45 minutes just as much as Some Nights would. And also honestly I find a lot of the latter record to be kind of depressing and not 'fun' at all.<br /><br />The title of this review says it all: on the first listen I thought it was a kick-ass record, and even the so called 'filler' songs always left me wanting more - it hold true a dozen listens later. If your curious about the vinyl packaging I mentioned, they stuck two records in a single outer sleeve - no gatefold, no lyrics sheets, and no download card. The artwork is nice and the wax plays true, but not much guts to look at.<br /><br />Anyway, buy it cus even your mom will like this album and she probably likes Hall & Oates, the Police, and whatever they play in Zumba classes.
B0076LAF24|5.0|sounds great, looks great, awesome DVD! It's a great concert, the power and energy that chemical brothers transmit its incredible. I recomended.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Catching up with old friends and foes and following their families journey's through the darkest days of modern history has been very educational and has put the complex events of that time into perspective. As well as being very informative the writing style has made the book very entertaining.  I was sorry to come to the end.  Maybe I can get a few good nights sleep now until the next book.  Thank You Ken for another great read.<br />Fantastic, Eductional and enlightening.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Magic, contests, a love story, and a mystical circus-- everything you never expected. This book was perfect-- dreamlike imagery, suspense, a love you could feel. All questions answered by the end which didn't feel like the end at all. One of the best books I have read in a very long time.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|ACTORS VERY TRUE TO THERE CHARACTERS.THEY WERE FLAWED GOOD GUYS.THE ACTION WAS PHENOMENAL AND DIDN'T DRAG ALONG.THIS MOVIE WAS TRUE TO THE COMIC BOOK ERA.
B008DKBPTO|5.0|The Timbuk2 Ballistic Envelope sleeve is exactly as promised.  This is a very well made sleeve with a beautiful design.  This sleeve provides a lot of protection for my Kindle Paperwhite.  Not afraid to take it anywhere when it is in this sleeve.  I have many other sleeves but this one is the best.  I'll have to purchase other Timbuk2 sleeves for my other Kindles.  I would recommend this product 100 percent.

0307742539|4.0|After reading the first two books, you are lusting for more and curious to know what Lisbeth (though the central character of the series, to the writer's credit, has been kept mysterious) will do next.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I'm not impressed with this book at all. It's dull and unnecessarily crass. I had hoped for a good read like her Harry Potter books, but for adults. Apparently, in Rowling's \\"adult world,\\" people are thoughtless and vulgar. Don't waste your time and money.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|One of the very best literary works in recent years. David Mitchell transforms the language and gives us overt and covert connections, symbolism, motives and themes. I can only hope that the movie will be able to touch the mastery Mitchell<br />displays. The narrative is branded pretentious from time to time, but in my opinion it serves its purpose of creating the cosmic connection. I implore everyone who didn't get through the first chapter to take your time to try to grasp what Mitchell is doing. If you find you cannot get through the next chapter as well you can always put it away anyway.
B008OJ291W|3.0|I'm not sure why Jeff Lynne would re-record ELO classics to sound almost exactly like the originals, but he has done just that.  It's not a fresh take on old tunes, it is a clone of the old tunes.  There are other ELO greatest hits packages with the original tunes on them.  Check them out instead.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed all of the Fifty Shades books and the last one was no different.  What a great modern day \\"trashy romance novel\\"!
B0087HT36U|4.0|I did not have to use in app purchase for the first 25 levels to get the gold crown. It is easier to aim than angry birds but still a fun little game to kill time with. I think the rest of the first campaign is just as easy to get best score. Not bad for FAOD.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I saw the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel at the theater and just had to buy the DVD at Amazon to watch it again and to show it to the rest of the family.  I love anything the Judi Dench stars in but this movie was full of other stars as well.  Hurry up and get it yourself.<br /><br />You will love it.
1439192812|5.0|Normally, I like to get audio versions of Dawkins' works. This one, however, you HAVE to get as a physical copy or you will miss out on the absolutely beautiful illustrations.<br /><br />Dawkins, of course, possesses and amazing intellect and it comes through in his books. I'm not a book reviewer, but I can say that I always enjoy reading/hearing Dawkins' works. I've been a fan for many years now. His The God Delusion got my through a tough deployment in Iraq. The Greatest Show On Earth saw me though more training that came later. Dawkins argues with hard facts, in plain English, and with the occasional dry humor. He's one of my favorite authors and I'm pleased to now read his latest work.<br /><br />I brought my copy of this book to one of Dawkins' lectures and had it signed. It's so lovely to have a book signed by the author, himself. My copy is now on proud display in my home library.
B000IYU9HW|5.0|An excellent movie for the time! Such true love of two young college students! A very sad ending but great movie.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Everyone in my family loves angry birds. Got it for free and worth that and more. Highly recommended, great fun!
0062183591|4.0|Unfortunately marketing departments understand this more than we do.  Great book for people who are curious about human nature and understanding how we think.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book. I found myself reading till the late hours just because I didn't want to put it down.  I would put it among the top of my favorites. I enjoyed each family and their journey through WW1 and am so looking forward to reading Book two of the trilogy. If it is as good as book one, the hard part will be waiting till 2014 for the third one.
B005LAIGOQ|2.0|I admit it.  I only saw this movie due to curiosity about how Daniel Radcliffe would look as someone other than Harry Potter.  He does well, but it almost seems familiar settings to have him in old buildings lit by candles.<br /><br />It's hard to say why this movie just does not entertain ........ it is visually rich - great sets, locations, wardrobe, etc ........ the actors all do well with their lines and all the characters are believable.  BUT the movie just NEVER draws the viewer into it.  All the \\"scary parts\\" rely on standard formulas - something moving in the background (that the hero never sees until it's too late) or something popping up suddenly (BOO!).<br /><br />It is just totally flat - one note - no depth at all.  Maybe the book was more engaging - I hope so.  The ending is disappointing and predictable.<br /><br />So, if you HAVE to see this movie - rent it.  This is NOT worth buying.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pintrest! It is custom made for all! This is all about your likes! You can find pretty much find anything you are interested in.  The decorating and party ideas are endless.

B009P13RQY|5.0|What can I say that probably hasn't been already said about Apocryphon? While not my favorite album by The Sword, it's definitely the second behind Gods of The Earth. From the opening chord of \\"Veil of Isis\\" you know exactly who you are listening to. Sure, people compare them to Black Sabbath which is in my opinion..a valid comparison. This is what more American metal bands need to follow along with. There are too many \\"generic\\" metal bands out there that if you were asked who was playing 9 out of 10 bands you would say would probably be right. There is no mistaking The Sword's sound. Here is my album breakdown:<br /><br />The Veil of Isis - 5<br />Amazing album opener, sets the tone for the remaining songs<br /><br />Cloak of Feathers - 5<br />Love the lyrics depicting the woman gracing the album<br /><br />Arcane Montane - 5<br />Great groove riffs, solid song<br /><br />The Hidden Masters - 4<br />Was surprised about how slow this started out, but still ends on a very high note<br /><br />Dying Earth - 5<br />The highlight of the album, my absolute favorite<br /><br />Execrator - 5<br />Another excellent track showcasing amazing musical talent<br /><br />Seven Sisters - 3<br />Probably my least favorite song, but still good nonetheless<br /><br />Hawks & Serpents - 4<br />Feels as if John is channeling Ozzy in his glory Black Sabbath days<br /><br />Eyes of The Stormwitch - 5<br />Amazing riffs and lyrics<br /><br />Apocyphon - 5<br />Was surprised to hear the synth starting out the song, but this is the best closing song I've heard in a long time<br /><br />The deluxe edition contains 4 live tracks and the song \\"Cheap Sunglasses\\". I'm not going to bother reviewing the live tracks since they are all great songs to begin with, and Cheap Sunglasses..well a great bonus song to a already amazing album by one of the last great American metal bands. Buy it. Support the band. Go see them live. Experience The Sword!
B009NQKPUW|2.0|DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING IT, I BOUGHT IT AND I HAVE WATCHED IT TWICE. BUT IT IS JUST-OK TO RENT ONLY...
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Impossible to put down once you've started reading this.. even more impossible to not read the second one with its ending.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Enjoyed the book very much.  We read it as a \\"book club\\" read and will have the discussion in a couple of weeks.  It should be a good one!!  I found that I could not put it down...and even though I'm not a particularly fast reader....I finished it in a weekend.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|This book is short and to the point. It has everything you could ever need in experienced advice in a brilliantly separated way. The simple fact that I got it and was done reading it in 3hrs speaks volumes about it's quality. I just couldn't put it down. Everything just makes sense. And even better, it's applicable! It's not just some advice spewed out by people making theories on what they think will work. It's actual experience being given to you on what does work and what doesn't. This is definitely a book everyone should read.
B0028R3G5O|4.0|This CD was full of all the hits that we remember from Cyndi Lauper.  I am getting ready to order a new one.  My grandaughter took the other one.
0375703764|5.0|I know it's fairly trite to say, but I can sincerely say that this book changed my life. One of the reasons that my wife and I had gotten together was on account of our mutual reading and love of this particular work. Now that she's passed away, I'm so glad that I was able to buy a second copy of it from Amazon - sort of as an homage to her.<br /><br />Anyway, about the book itself: this book started as an internet phenomenon a long while back, with people passing around text files that were \\"leaked\\" from it. It was a grand old marketing ploy, but it worked, driving this particular tome into having a cult following. Since then, it's been reprinted twice (I believe), and has garnered more and more readers. This is actually four stories in one - the cataloging of events regarding the Navidsons by Zampano; the few scraps of information we learn about Zampano from Johnny Truant's researching; the story of Johnny Truant's search for the truth and recollection of his own life; and his mother's letters to him and her descent into madness. Some would say there's a fifth story being told between the lines, which is more or less true.<br /><br />All in all, House (imagine that being blue) of Leaves is a book within a book within a book, sort of like the Inception of novels without being an overwrought Hollywood production. Danielewski proved with House (blue) of Leaves that he was a master of psychology in such a way that made you wonder and guess about the true intentions and real, actual identities of his characters. This book is both a story(ies), but I also keep it next to my books on philosophy. It raises a few interesting questions regarding the nature of our existence and the nature of the existence of all things. Certainly, there is enough here for avid horror readers to enjoy - there are strange and hideous terrors that are largely left unexplained save for the House (blue) itself, and there is that sense of palpable dread and madness in many of the interwoven stories that are told here. For people who aren't interested in straight up genre fiction, this book would also pique their interest on account of it being a legitimate fiction novel that, at least in my humble opinion, is almost allegorical to the world in which we live. Once you get to the end, you might see what I mean.<br /><br />Anyway, this is my favorite book. It will likely always be my favorite book and I encourage anyone and everyone to try it out. In the words of the grandfather from The Princess Bride: it's got fighting, [self-induced] torture, revenge, monsters, chases, escapes, [madness], true love, miracles, [cyclopean terrors of the Jungian shadow]. Something for everyone.
0399157565|4.0|If you are an ardent Patricia Cornwell fan, favoring the Kay Scarpetta books,  The Bone Bed  will be an interesting read. Scarpetta and her sharp investigative skills have been resurrected, and  she is back at the scene.  Also back are Benton, who seems secretive;  Lucy, who is again mysterious, and Marino, who gets hauled away to who knows where, just when Scarpetta needs him the most.<br />The best part of the book is when Kay is called to the witness stand to testify in a murder case that is really a missing person case because it doesn't have a body identified as the victim.  Kay is pulvorized on the stand by an aggressive defense attorney, without a word from the prosecutor who could have and should have helped her out.  It was so tense, I felt that I should be able to help her out.  Special Agent Douglas Burke also increased the tension in the story.<br />Because this story had so many threads that broke away from the beginning plot,  I was impressed with how the threads were all rewoven into the end; finding the unlikely killer in an unlikely way.

B009EANE3M|5.0|In short-  I have been listening to The Script for some time and have also enjoyed the group live in Indianapolis.  Long story short every time they come out with something new I listen and think: \\"Wow this is pretty good but nothing too overly spectacular.\\"  Then it always grows on me. They are amazing and just having the music on in the background makes you say \\"damn what song is that I must have missed that one!\\"  Love this group!
B0037VNX44|5.0|I will admit after the first 10-15 minutes I was questioning my choice in watching this movie, HOWEVER....man am I happy I hung on!<br /><br />Tom Hardy gives a near perfection performance....I only say near since I am not familiar before this movie with Charles Bronson and had never seen any footage of the actual man to know if Hardy did a perfect performance.<br />It was funny, (I found my self laughing out loudly at some scenes) emotional (I actually felt some form of sympathy for the character and curiosity (causing me to research a bit on the man to find out more about the real Bronson)<br />This is a gem of a movie, worth checking out and the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic!<br /><br />An enjoyable viewing experience!
B006RECSBC|4.0|I had been looking forward to seeing this movie from the first trailer I saw. Finally, I had an opportunity to watch it and I must say, I loved it. I think it was a pretty well crafted story, and the main actress, Sara Paxton, did a wonderful job of convincing me of her character's personality. I was creeped out by the storyline, scared several times (which I'm not usually) and highly entertained. Things that were a bit lackluster for me ... Possible spoiler - Pat Healy's character, who seems much older then the character that is portrayed by  Sara Paxton seems to be very infatuated with her. That and his silly faux mohawk was a bit unsettling ... he comes off as the creepy uncle or cousin that your family doesn't want to talk a lot about. My other disappointment was the ending which left me with two big questions: Again possible spoilers - Who was the old man and what did his note say? Did the ghosts kill Sara Paxton's character by scaring her to death, or did they try to help her and accidentally scare her (they seemed to be herding her to the locked door) if is so, why? Both ghosts were related to tragic love stories from what we can see, so why are they trying to kill poor Sara ... then the final scene of the door shutting ... I take it we're supposed to understand there are three ghosts including Sara at the inn now, but ... the slamming door wasn't creepy and left me saying \\"Huh?\\" I suspect we're supposed to assume its here, but??<br />So why four stars? Because all that said, I was highly entertained and loved the story up until the last 10+ minutes. Its really only the last 10+ minutes or so that leave me wanting more and feeling like I was let down by the writer. It seems anymore, these horror stories/ghost stories don't provide answers, and I don't need them to, but I'd like to feel that I had a full meal and a bit more clarity on what was going on. Remember, this wasn't a 10 minute film short. This was a full length film and the ghosts are just as important a character as any of the living ... we need to understand their motivations too. Here, they end up (because of the ending) feeling a bit more like stage props ... particularly the ghost of the old man ... how will I get Sara's character to the basement ... I'll use this old man ghost to scare her down there ... or maybe I could use a coat rack? No, old man ghost is more scary!nt a character as any of the living ... we need to understand their motivations too.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|The Kindle app could be so useful, but it makes any kind of technical reading a real chore.<br /><br />I use my Android Kindle mostly for technical reading, so that I don't have to carry 10 or 20 books with me whenever I travel.  But the Kindle app is very poor in a number of respects.<br /><br />First, Search is just awful.  You can't type in any kind of meaningful search terms.  For example, you can't specify \\"match case\\" or \\"look for \\"this\\" OR \\"that\\", or match the whole word.<br /><br />The pages, when you're reading show The name of the book at the top of each page.  But they don't show the chapter you are in, like any normal book does.  Really. Amazon?  Is this the best you can do?  Of course, the books, don't show the page, but for cryin' out loud, it is always helpful to know what chapter you're in.<br /><br />The next thing should be painfully obvious:  You should be able to go to the Index of the book, easily, using the \\"Goto...\\" function.  But you can't.  Instead, you have to use \\"Go to...\\" to go to the Table of Contents, then scroll right umpteen pages until you get to the Index link, then click on that Link.  Why, oh why, would you not put the Index in the \\"Go to...\\" options?  Being able to get to the index is especially important, since the search features are so abysmally poor.<br /><br />Then, speaking of Indexing, why wouldn't Kindle allow the creation of a digital index, so that searching for words in the Kindle app would be instantaneous, instead of having to take 15 to 30 seconds to read through the whole book.  Hello, Amazon:  Please join the 21st century, allow users to index their material.  It sucks to wait, and wait, and wait, while the decrepit and feature-poor search function chugs along doing a search.  And while you're at it, why not make an app-wide index feature, so that I can fins all the books on my app which contain a search term?<br /><br />And the voice search feature, doesn't work.  It requires you be connected to the internet, which would be nice to know when you launch the feature, but instead it takes your voice command, spins for 5 or 10 seconds, then says \\"Google can't be reached\\".  Oh thanks, Amazon, that's helpful.  If you need connectivity up front, why not just tell the user that, up front, and spare them the pain of waiting?  And at least for me, the voice search has never worked, not once, even when I am connected.<br /><br />So, Amazon, you need to send your app developers back to school, on this app.  It is very much third-rate.
B0040Z9H5K|5.0|I am a big fan of both Robert and the Iron Man and this movie does no injustice to either of them.<br />Great movie and a must watch for the fans.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! I don't have to take my computer to the kitchen or sewing room anymore! I can just take it on my Kindle! So easy to use and has everything right there. HIGHLY recommend it.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I admit I was skeptical at first especially with as many big personalities as there are in this; however, I found that the action sequences weren't cheap in their production and was mostly believable rather than some that are insanely overdone(I'm thinkin bout you Transformers 3). They actually had a good story line as well and tied all the characters together well and didn't focus too awful much on just one character. Unfortunately, I am unsure in what ways a sequel would measure up and how this effects other superhero productions that feature just one.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Works great.  A little pricey for what it is but most iPad accessories are. Glad I made this purchase for my iPad.

B0018QQQK8|5.0|This was an easy read and very entertaining.  Didn't require much thought, but thoroughly enjoyable.  Excited to see the movie made based on the book.  Would've liked a better ending, but still enjoyed it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Trust me this game is beast! you get to make you own town and much more awesome stuff. MUST buy this game!!!!!!!!!!!
B000FC1MM8|4.0|The saga of Harry continues with the somehat predictable set of plot twists, confrontations, deceptions and romantic incidents in this novel. Harry's character evloves somewhat, though not in any really unexpected fashion. Some of the twists were funny, others somewhat sad. Overall, a quick and plesant read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|These book keep you very interested in what is going to happen next. Also it is a very romanic love story. Can't wait to finish book two and start reading book three
1451629192|5.0|The book arrived on time in excellent condition.  A very sad book, but reading Jaycee Dugard's words was an amazing story.  How she could keep such a positive attitude during her captivity was up-lifting in a sense.  She could teach us a lot.  What a wonderful spirit she has.  I'm not sure I could keep my sanity as well as she did under those circumstance. It made for very good reading. I hope she can enjoy a normal life from here on in.  God Bless her and her girls.
B001NZ3DY6|5.0|Shania Twain is the real thing when it comes to true talent and this compilation reflects that. The song choices are are spot on and include offerings from country and pop genres. If you are a true Shania fan you can't go wrong with this compilation.
B001FBSMF8|5.0|This album is for those who listen to many genres of music; it is not for people who only like metal.<br /><br />Chris Cornell plus Timbaland together make an amazing team .  All of the songs are catchy; my 3 year old son loves it (note: I don't play the first song with my son present!  The lyrics repeat in the chorus \\"That B*tch ain't a part of me\\" because... well like I said the songs are catchy and I heard him singing along one day!).  Every song blends into the next and makes for a solid listening experience.  That is not to say that all of the songs sound the same.  There is a bridge from song to song that make the whole album easy to listen to.<br /><br />Don't listen to all these naysayers.  If you LOVE Chris Cornell and you have an open mind to music, you may well love this album as much as I do.  Give it a try.  You might find it on heavy rotation in your iPod.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this app, its challenging and fun, i recommend it. its very addictive and it rocks, the challenge it to unlock all the games and beat them, this app rocks
B00932H7FW|5.0|Homeland is a great series. Strong acting, great story line and very edgy - keeps you at the edge of your seats.
B009KUWWW0|5.0|Great Book - a little long but I am really enjoying it - especially on my kindle as it makes it easy for me to tote around!
0446547646|2.0|It took me a while to finish this one. I felt obligated since someone let me borrow it from them and now I'm probably going to have to discuss....It wasn't horrible but it definetly has been done before. Nicholas Sparks book are now boring and repetitive to me. I felt no emotional connection to any of the characters and I didn't feel like dawson and amanda were eachother true loves. Maybe I have just become cynical in my old age. I would say that I am never going to read another Sparks book again but unfortunatly that same someone gave me Safe Haven to read.
B0001I561E|4.0|it's got alot better quality image, but it has an annoying too clear of a menu. I press play right away so i dont have to hear that violin sound.  But my son enjoys watching this cartoon. I guess us 80's kids were just used of the VHS quality that the clear image now was kind of weird.But i recommend this to parents looking for a disney classic.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Best movie i've seen all year. I was a litte upset because I lost the stream during the movie, but overall it was worth renting
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Finally, I had the pleasure of spending 2-hours romping around India with 7 of my favorite Brits.  The film was over-the-top for me - fun, exhilarating and confirmed my belief that we can take-on with grace and courage any of life's challenge(s).  Whatever the age and stage they may befall us.<br />My favorite, all time, actor is always Bill Nighy - and he was superbly funny and touching and witty all wrapped up in his inimitable style.  Judi Dench and Maggie Smith are, as always, enchantingly divine to watch - and that's mainly because they always live the role - not act it.  The main messages: that of enduring friendships, zest for participating in life's adventures, along with just plain having fun - while in India, for, after all, India is India, not the United States.  Let's not forget that important element.  I have had the privilege and pleasure of moving many times during my life - most recently, 6 times since 2003, and always my first choices have unfolded.  So, the film gave me the inspiration that, perhaps, 6 months, or more, in India would be an adventure not-to-be-missed.  The India scenery is gorgeous as are the faces of India's people.  I knew I would love the film because I knew it was about taking chances - however, it's glowing and subtle messages are dazzlingly appropriate for the not so dazzlingly times we're living in today.  I'm sending copies as my Christmas presents.
B001414XLQ|5.0|I enjoy listening to this album whenever I want to rock!!! Ironic and thought provoking lyrics, sometimes witty. A fun listen.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|I've always wondered about the business side of a popular author who has the capacity to crank out book after book, year after year.  I know I'm jaded but at this stage in Grisham's career, I can't help but believe that John creates an outline, writes the most important dialog passages, then passes the rest of the writing to a group of minions who then \\"color\\" the pages with Grisham sounding prose.<br /><br />This book certainly has the feel of a book written by committee.  I've read several of the negative reviews of The Racketeer and many of them focus on the weak ending.  I say that the entire book is unbelievable and yes, the ending is very weak, abrupt and it left me saying out loud, \\"and that's it???\\"<br /><br />Mr. Grisham, this book stinks.  It could have gone somewhere but it needed another couple of rewrites to get it to your usual high standards.  I pre-purchased this turkey because I'm a devoted Grisham reader and up to this point could say that I've never been disappointed.<br />Well, I want my money back.  This book is short (read it in two days) ill-conceived, poorly executed and again, largely unbelievable.<br />Skip this one folks.  I won't be pre-purchasing another Grisham novel any time soon.  I'll wait for the reviews.<br />This reader feels like the victim of a racketeer.  His initials are J G.<br />Ron Davis, Long Beach CA
B006PHD0RW|5.0|its such a good game lots of levels challenging extremely fun and could be played with 2 people taking turns trust I graceless to Alaska in a car with 3 siblings and there were no fights over my kindle!!!!!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|well worth $0!  Don't have to spend money just be patient. I enjoy these types of games &amp; this is one of better ones. But then I love dragons!!!
B007BRJYF2|5.0|Very pleasant game.  Graphics are excellent and the tilt screens add a touch of originality to the HO areas.  Didn't make you work too hard and I enjoyed the way they incorporated pictures that followed the artwork of the original books.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book was recommended to me.  I was going on vacation and what a captive book!!  Could not put the book down.  From start to finish, you were pulled into this family.  Very great read.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Awesome film. Favorite lines - You may be a demi god but we have a Hulk and Puny god.  I received the Blu-ray/DVD on or before the promised date.  I bought 2 copies one for me and one for a gift.  I can't say enough good things about the sevice I consistenly receive from Amazon. I would highly recommend using them.
0812992784|4.0|A frightening window into what life is like when an entire country, and much of one of the world's religions, wants you dead. The grinding, day-in-day-out emotional toll of life under protection is hard to imagine.<br />It also excels at showing from the inside Rushdie's relentless defense of secularism in the face of religious extremists, and those who would appease them.<br />If the book also slides slowly into name-dropping and other afflictions of the celebrity jet set, that too may be seen as part of the price of surviving the fatwa: If Rushdie hadn't publicly tied his plight to the larger issue of freedom to question religion, he might never have been freed of the fatwa.<br />That effort has echoes today in other faiths besides Islam and other nations than Iran --  a battle far from won, as the U.S. election season has made clear -- and for that the world owes Rushdie a debt.
0756407125|5.0|Very original and entertaining. Slow in places but nevertheless incredibly engrossing. Cannot wait for the 3rd in the series. Rarely is such time (and words) devoted to the development of a character. Superb.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so amazing and fun! Super addicting and very much like Pc version. Buy now! Totally worth the money!
0307744434|3.0|I read this book in two days during Superstorm Sandy.<br /><br />I am not surprised that Erin Morgenstern is a visual artist. The descriptions of the circus were the best part of the book. It's all black and white with punctuations of red. Kind of steampunk with caramel, hot cider, popcorn, and trained kittens.<br /><br />While I loved the description of the circus, what the book lacked was solid follow through on the storyline. What was the great conflict between two magicians? I am still not sure. Why were the two central characters pitted against each other? I am still not sure? How did the book end? I am still not sure.<br /><br />I think Morgenstern wrote herself into a House of Mirrors that she just couldn't write herself out of...while the plot was somewhat disappointing, the idea of the magical circus is fabulous. Sadly though, the story has more style than substance.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is my favorite tv series. I rented the first season from the video store. I had never heard of it before. I was hooked instantly. I could hardly stand the wait for season 2.<br /><br />My husband has never been into zombies. I tried to get him to watch the series with me before without prevail; however, he listens to Bob & Tom every day. He came in last week and said, \\"I must be missing something...Bob & Tom said 10 million people tuned in to watch the first episode of season 3.\\" So we spent the whole weekend getting caught up on the past episodes. Guess who's hooked now?<br /><br />It keeps getting better and better!
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Admittedly, I really like the sound of Mumford & Sons.  Something about the mix of it all does \\"it\\" for me.  This new album delivers on more audible goodness to follow up on their prior release.  Well worth the purchase.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is my altimate favorite game now! I don't think I will be board any time soon. Just wish I could have more coins. Maybe unlimited! I so recommend this game for the board!
B00005QW5X|5.0|Great in every possible way.  It's one of the best movies ever and I highly recommend it.  Can't watch it enough.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Oh I could not put this book down. It captured me in the same way the first novel did.<br />The characters were bought to life exquisitely, and I felt I was with them every step of the way.<br />I cannot wait for round 3 :)
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The minute I started watching this, I was mesmerized.  I had not watched any of it on TV, but kept hearing about how wonderful it was, so I bit the bullet and bought both seasons at once.  WOW!  What a series, and now I can't wait to watch the next season!
B00003CXCD|3.0|Roman Holiday is a 1953 romantic comedy directed by William Wyler and starring Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck and Eddie Albert. It was filmed entirely in Italy and relates the story of a mischevious child-woman princess named Anne who runs away from home to have a blast with the 'common people.' It was the motion picture which kicked off Hepburn's career and gained her an oscar for Best Leading Actress.<br /> I haven't seen any of the other Best Leading Actress nominees that year but I wish Audrey Hepburn could have won an oscar for a more substantial role like Natasha in War and Peace or Sister Luke in The Nun's Story where she proved she was more than a mere movie star for romantic comedies anymore than John Wayne was a mere movie star for westerns. That being said, I still enjoyed her kooky antics and classy attire. Gregory Peck (Joe Bradley) does his best in what is obviously a Cary Grant role and the rest of the cast is not particulary memorable.<br /> Sometimes there is a little too much dialogue and the movie probably could have wrapped up when Joe drives Anne back to the palace but there are some charming scenes such as the Mouth of Truth and the motorcycle ride.<br /> When you have the flu or are stuck inside during a rainy saturday afternoon, sit back and watch Audrey Hepburn make mischief. You could do worse.<br />Three Stars.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|I saw most of this movie in the theater before my friends and I just had to walk out.  Poorly written/acted action films should at least have the decency not to take themselves too seriously, along with a high enough production value to make the film visually entertaining.  This film was on the very low end of all those categories.  (Again, I saw this in the theater, where the visual effects are supposed to be the most stunning, and I felt like I was watching a D level made for TV movie on a big screen).  The premise is supposed to be campy, but the director/writer/producer couldn't seem to agree on whether to commit to campy-ness or take the serious hero route.  It was too annoying even to laugh at.
0345803493|5.0|Fifty Shades Darker is a fantastic book to Fifty Shades of Grey.  I started this series and after I put it down I find myself still thinking of the story line. The books I bought are in fantastic shape considering I bought them used
B000JMKTLO|2.0|For people with mental illness, this book could possibly trigger self harm.<br /><br />Nothing special about this book. Its an average thriller with a predictable abrupt ending. Highly over-rated!
B007U4DB4G|5.0|Just love these movies.  Am an avid chihuahua lover so these are the best to watch.  Can get a little corny at times but still, just looking at all those adoreable dogs even the ones not chihuahuas, you love the show!!!!  Hope they keep on doing them.  My grandkids love them too.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Love this game it's simple and fun like the classic arcade game! It can be truly free if you are patient love that feature as well...fun for everyone!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is so cool! so cool! you should get this game because it's so cool! I love this game!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Alot of people complained about it being hard or boring. GET INTO IT THEY DONT GIVE YOU EVERYTHING RIGHT AWAY SO YOU CAN GET GOOD FIRST! also try to get all stars :)
B00913DPW2|3.0|graphics ok. finding puzzle pieces,  coins,  moths fun. the games are hard though..even if you know what you have to do,  its too detailed...not worth the effort.
B005XN31LY|5.0|Season 1 of this show was excellent.  The storytelling was great and the characters were all extremely interesting.  The dual-storytelling of the fairy tale characters and their real-world equivalents made the show seem much faster paced and intriguing.  The show also managed to surprise me with some twists that I did not see coming.<br /><br />All in all, a great show.
B0078XFYDA|4.0|Having read the previous two books by Richard Dawkins, I expected a more elaborate and detailed book. Nevertheless it is a good book, that sceptics will enjoy.

B008AITJ24|4.0|Seven seasons of \\"Bones\\" and it still manages to surprise and delight. I was afraid that it would become maudlin once the baby arrived, but it just got funnier. (Dr. Brennan's requirements for the child-care people are so in character and so droll that I eagerly await each new development.) If you enjoyed the first six seasons, you'll probably like this one just as much.
B007THA4FI|5.0|A dark tale is woven by this master storyteller this time round!  Rowling knows how to create colorful characters, an interwoven, complex plot, and a small town setting to keep the reader riveted until the unexpected end!  Brilliant!

B007SGLZP8|2.0|I can't blame anyone. I bought this book. I know that in recent years I have found discovered two things about Grisham's books: (1) they are very easy to read, which I like, and (2) at best the are mediocre, which I don't like.<br /><br />There is nothing believable about this book. There is really not much excitement. The characters are particularly likeable or realistic. But at least this isn't the typical \\"the legal system sucks and are lawyers are unhappy\\" theme of Grisham. It is more of a \\"the government is crooked, especially the FBI\\" theme.<br /><br />Is it bad? Not terrible bad. Is it good? No, not particularly good. Just somewhere in the middle. But it was easy to read.
B000007SIN|5.0|I recently purchased a very nice 5.1 speaker system and wanted a surround sound disc to try it out.<br />I purchased this used from Amazon and it came in perfect condition for 1/3 the new price.<br />This disc is well produced and sounds amazing and will test any system.<br />The songs are all very good and the studio musicians are the best out there.<br />The CD 'Gaucho' sounds great in stereo but the 5.1 DTS is incredable with the backing vocals coming from the rear speakers. The 5.1 mix is perfect and brings out all the instruments in surround sound.<br />If you want to impress someone with your surround sound system just put this on and enjoy.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Great game.  Really fun.  I only have the free version, but I'll probably get the full.  Start with the free.  You will love it.

B001FD5KJM|5.0|A very, very well rounded movie. Only one gripe and that is that we have a movie about Iron Man and they only play the Black Sabbath song for the credits . . . kids these days
B0054JZC6E|4.0|game is pretty good, with varying levels of difficulty. seems like it is too costly and time consuming to gain access to the later games, but enjoying it so far.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|This is a well-written, fast-paced novel that keeps the reader's attention.<br />It is what I term an \\"entertaining, fun read.\\"
0545140323|2.0|The Lonely Hearts Club is about girl power and being a die hard Beatles fan. That's pretty much it. The heroine Penny Lane has sworn off boys for the rest of her high school career (she's a junior) because Nate, a boy she loved and trusted broke her heart.<br /><br />So she decides to create The Lonely Hearts Club for girls who are sick of guys breaking their hearts. OK, what to the evs? (as Tracy would say but who talks like that?) You know right off the bat that swearing off boys is no easy task but Penny makes it sound like it's a simple walk in the park. And while I can see how some girls would join this club to get a break from dating it's totally unrealistic for pretty much all the girls in the high school to join a club that swears off boys. That I just cannot see happen.<br /><br />Also Penny Lane just annoyed me. She's a walking contradiction and doesn't make sense. She says she will never date again in high school but she secretly likes Ryan but denies this countless times when it's so freaking obvious that she likes him and he likes her from the get go.<br /><br />Penny and Ryan's friendship is also something that is contradicting and confusing to me. It's because of Ryan that Penny lost her best friend Diane and while Penny pretty much avoided Diane for the past four years, she would talk to Ryan and even flirt with him that does not even make sense when he's the reason she lost her best friend to begin with.<br /><br />Penny's talk of \\"all boys are the scum of the earth\\" got old really really fast. I just hated how she sounded all high and mighty when she acted just like the boys she claimed were scum. She's mad when Tracy's crushes won't give her a second look but Penny does this to Tyson a guy she thinks isn't worth a second glance but clearly he is. In all relationships the girls are innocent victims while the guys break the girls' hearts.<br /><br />This book just had too much girl power in it and the girls were abusing it. In addition, all the Beatles references were used way too much. I think all the readers get it, Penny and her family are die hard Beatles fans so the author could have gave the Beatles a rest once in a while instead of mentioning them every couple pages.<br /><br />So I'm sad to say that while a tiny part of me liked this, the rest of me just couldn't. I give this book two stars.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|So nice to have this movie on one disk now. Had it on VHS for a long time. Couldn't pass this up especially the digital copy that comes with it. Was worth it.

159514188X|4.0|This book was recommended to me from a close friend of mine. I did not fully understand the book the first time I read it. I don't mean that it was poorly written, I mean that it was filled with events at some parts and other parts were bland. I reread the book recently and I'm glad I did!  I love Jay's writing style. It's easy to follow and keeps you interested. I recommend this book to all readers 13 and up! :)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Kept me on my toes, easy to follow the story & characters. The twists in the story were unexpected. A very good read!
B009YG2ND8|2.0|SquareEnix's reputation in the mobile world is for the most part simple: ports of their most well known games (in this case ports of ports) with ramped up prices that are far more than desired in such a market in general, not to mention a market in which emulators exist for the device via sideloading.<br /><br />For those who have played the DS version this game will look familiar.  That would be because it is essentially a port of the iOS version of that.  The same bugs in the versions exist plus some new ones, and throw in possible added slowdown on top of that depending on your device.<br /><br />Unless you really want to experience the 3D version very much and don't have another way to play it this isn't very reccomended.  Even if you do, waiting for a sale is preferred.
B005LAIIDU|5.0|***A few mild spoilers***<br /><br />TOY STORY is perhaps the finest example of this swell premise, that, when the lights go out and the humans turn away, inanimate objects achieve a life of their own. And this is why puppets have always scared the crap out of me. WRECK-IT RALPH posits that when Litwak's Arcade shuts down for the day, then it's time for the characters that populate the various video games to let their hair down and mingle at Game Central Station, a communal site linked by interconnected power cables and nexus to all the video games in Litwak's.<br /><br />\\"Hey, you moved my stump. I'm gonna wreck it.\\" That's motivation and intent from our main man, Wreck-It Ralph, the villain of an old school game called Fix-It Felix, Jr. Ralph is a big, ungainly guy with massive hands and feet, ideal for demolition. He stands at 9 feet tall and weighs over 600 pounds. If you put a quarter in the slot, he'll wreck the crap out of the Niceland apartment building, except that then the handyman, Fix-It Felix, Jr., repairs everything with a mere touch of his magic hammer.<br /><br />Sometimes it's rough being the bad guy. When the work day's done, Ralph is still vilified while Felix is feted. While Felix is invited to parties at the Niceland penthouse, Ralph sleeps and sulks in the town's garbage dump. He attends a weekly support group for video game villains and confesses that, after 30 years on the job, he's tired of playing the bad guy, of being unappreciated. And if you've seen the trailer, then you've already grinned at the unsettled reaction from Clyde, the orange Pac-Man ghost. Determined to be a hero, Ralph sneaks into the recently plugged-in, first person shooter game, Hero's Duty. He's heard that Hero's Duty grants a gold medal to the winner. He believes that a medal will shake up the status quo back in Niceland. But things don't go as planned. Ralph isn't prepared for the grit and violence in Hero's Duty. Plus, it's hard to be the hero when all you know is to wreck things. Two other things he didn't think thru. If a character dies outside of the confines of his own game, he won't regenerate. Also, Ralph's absence is noted by the arcade owner who promptly puts the Fix-It Felix game out of order. This spells doom for the residents of Niceland. It's how folks like Q*bert became homeless.<br /><br />Omigosh, Root Beer Tapper!! WRECK-IT RALPH is the 52nd Disney animated feature film, and this one resurrects your sense of nostalgia, especially if you were a kid of the '80s who spent his or her weeknights and -ends at the local video arcade. A huge chunk of the fun is from trying to catch all the visual references and the gaming injokes. (The sequence with the therapy circle alone is worth the price of admission.) But the film would've gotten tiresome if that's all it was. Thankfully, John C. Reilly, with his likable big lug screen persona, lends a really sympathetic voice as Wreck-It Ralph. The film's emotional core hinges on the unexpected friendship he forms with a misfit child named Vanellope von Schweetz. In the realm of the Sugar Rush kart-racing game, Vanellope is shunned because she's a glitch, an accidental programming. Nevertheless, she yearns to be a racer. She thinks she'll be a good one. She doesn't know how to drive. And now here's Wreck-It Ralph crashlanding into Sugar Rush in an escape pod.<br /><br />Sarah Silverman, confounding my worst expectations, is endearing (and very sardonic) as Vanellope. Maybe it helped that she and John C. Reilly were now and then allowed to improv their dialogue. If you end up with a lump in your throat and maybe misting up, well, I was close to that. And two other noteworthy voice actors: Jane Lynch as the tough-as-nails Sergeant Calhoun who tracks a possible threat to Sugar Rush and who also drops some of the film's most colorful quotes and Jack McBrayer who is hilarious as the determinedly goody-two-shoes Fix-It Felix. And for the trivia-heads, that's Ed Wynn whom Alan Tudyk ischanneling as King Candy. Good casting.<br /><br />So, yeah, I'm pretty biased. This film dives straight into my wheelhouse, and I see no flaws. The animation is a seamless blending of the CG slickness found in the contemporary first person shooter game (like \\"Hero's Duty\\") and the more rudimentary rendered, pixel-obvious \\"classic\\" '80s game (like \\"Fix-It Felix, Jr.\\"). The humor amuses on two fronts. Kids will laugh at the gags. Grown-ups will also laugh, but for grown-up reasons. WRECK-IT RALPH is highly recommended for those who relish vivid adventure stories that don't stinge on heart or nostalgia. I think I saw Dig Dug, as well.<br /><br />Lastly, I loved the exquisitely animated lead-in short \\"Paperman.\\" It tells the story of an office drone who tries to catch the attention of a girl by sailing paper airplanes across the imposing gulf of a busy street in New York from his office highrise to hers.channeling as King Candy.

B008H6GH8I|1.0|the story line is very VERY!!!!! boring you will hate this movie bigtime im a fan and the only thing thats good is when the lickers fight the tyraunt
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Once you understand the many aspects and rules within the game, it's enjoyable. Meant for 3-6 players, but can take a toll on you energy-wise. Unique and customizable.
B00785P2QC|4.0|the only thing i would change would being able to build without all the goals.  i wish you could just build on your own<br /><br />this is a fun game
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is a beautiful period production!  The English do it best!  Fine actors, interesting story lines, good development of character and attention to detail!  The beautiful estates are beyond compare.
034580404X|5.0|I could not put the books down.  I have never read a series so fast.  Three books in two weeks.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Totally different direction from the first book  and not at all like fifty shades... Loved every minute of it! Can't wait for the next one? Will there be one?
B008VBYN80|4.0|its is not a bad game to pass time but I hate that it wants you to use money wheb it sais  its free
1574214276|5.0|Of all the Zen books I've purchased, this one is the best.  Lots of inspiration, great illustrations, black & white and color, great layout.  Thanks!
B006T3RM08|5.0|This product went way beyond my expectations! Good quality, good fit. Even better design! We, as consumers have gotten so jaded in recent years due to crappy manufacturing processes that when a true high quality product hits the market, we are astounded. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS to anyone considering buying it. You won't be disappointed!
0671027344|5.0|I had wanted to read this book since it came out, back when I was in high school. I finally got the chance and it was worth the wait. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of the most amazing and inspiring books that I've ever read. I can understand why it has amassed such a following.<br /><br />Through the letters by Charlie, Chbosky is able to express the excitement and pain of being a teenager. This book doesn't gloss over tough issues like rape, abuse, and suicide. It actually deals with them in a way that so many other books don't. Actually, it is more respectful of them than even some therapists are.<br /><br />I can honestly say that this book made me laugh and cry. It was so heart-breaking when a character would go through something painful, but it was also so wonderful because there was always a lesson learned from it. Chbosky gave insight and strength to the sufferers in a way that made them heroes, instead of just victims. And that was just beautiful.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this novel to young people and to adults. It is incredible and should be something that everyone tries to read at some point in his or her life.
B004APVI1G|4.0|LOTG is animated children's film with enough their to keep an adults interest as well.<br />This movie has quiet a few characters and I couldn't help but feel some of them just didn't get enough time to really make their mark the way the film makers where hoping they would. This film moves visciously,unapologetically fast and that's where lies the heart of the problem.<br />I was really surprised at how well the action sequences came across though and the 3D was exceptional. I think just about any child would love this movie.<br /><br />I think without 3D this movie still looks gorgeous and you could definently spend your hour and a half watching far worse,but the 3D certainly adds to the experience here.<br />The biggest problem with Legend of the Guardians is the story just seems too big for the scope of this movie and I really wish they had a directors cut with an additional half an hour or so. The movie seems too focused on moving the plot along as fast as it can when I feel their where some moments it should have slowed down and let the characters \\"breathe\\" a little.<br /><br />I would say this film is worthy of a weekend rental, and if your a 3D buff,worth keeping around in your collection.<br /><br />Another plus to the 3D version of this film is a Looney Tune short which features wile e coyote and the Road Runner. It runs around five minutes and packs a great punch in 3D.
0307887898|1.0|I've been reading Steve Blank's blogs on lean startups and product strategy since he started. Read his \\"[[ASIN:0976470705 The Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Products that Win]]\\" or his \\"[[ASIN:0984999302 The Startup Owner's Manual: The Step-By-Step Guide for Building a Great Company]]l\\" if you must read a book on this subject.<br /><br />His work and mentoring apparently inspired Eric Ries to write this book, which is fine but he does a really bad job of representing the original concepts. Makes me wonder how much of them he really understood.<br /><br />Apart from being overly verbal and having a lot of repetitive waste in the narrative he's also constantly promoting himself and/or his fantastic consultancy efforts for others. Up to the point of nausea for me. Entire book could probably be condensed in less than a 100 pages if his ego was removed.<br /><br />Read the original work, leave this alone.<br /><br />However the concepts Eric Ries tries to describe in this book are very valid and real! It is mostly Steve Blank that applied them to startups and the Toyota lean authors that originally created them. If you managed to finish this book and found the content interesting please, please, please read up on it. There is lots of material out there and this book is definitely not a sparkling gem of wisdom on this subject.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Great read and in depth look behind the life of a cookie. I have even more appreciation now for what goes into my meal when I venture out
B008OOYALE|5.0|I enjoy this game. I have to play it constantly at least twice a day. Its fun to watch the dragons grow and awesome when they add new dragons based on time of year and seasons.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is one of the best apps ever I love it ; it is one of my favorites now that I have this app I am on pintrest a lot more<br />I love pinterest it rocks
B009ESIGHI|5.0|If you haven't seen this film, you simply must! The story is wonderful, and the muppet crew adds a real barrel full of fun and flair. My personal favorite is Rizzo, the lovable and goofy rat that tags along with Gonzo as Gonzo takes on the role of narrator. This film is great for all ages, I love it just as much as I did as a young buck and it will always hold a place in my heart next to home alone as the perfect movies to get me in the Christmas spirit! This movie is basically Egg Nog, without the fat!!!<br /><br />And to address the 'cut' of the song 'The Love is Gone,' let me just say a heartfelt thank you to Disney, as that song is the worst part of the whole movie. I always either fast forward the song anyway, or make a fridge run if I am watching it with someone that insists on viewing the worst part of the movie. Actually the only person that seems to like that song is my sister, and she has a messy room anyway.<br /><br />In conclusion this is honestly a wonderful movie. It is a MUST in any; Christmas collection; Muppets collection; DVD collection! FIVE STARS without a doubt, and I cannot wait for the special features!
B009NF54ZE|4.0|can't get pass level six.  am stuck on the match game because there is only 1 bottle.  any suggestions????????<br />is very frustrating because I Sam enjoying the game.
B00913DPW2|1.0|I am usually pretty good at these games but I just found this one impossible all you do is spend your time tapping all over the screen hoping you will stumble upon some thing that has something to do with the game. I found it really frustrating and boring! I felt like a dog chasing it's tail. I did not even find worthy of a star.

0446580848|3.0|I too have read every Demille book and have enjoyed every one of them.  With previous books, I frequently found myself laughing out loud at the author's irreverant wit.  I truly could not wait for \\"The Panther\\" to be released - I love John Corey!  But once I started to read, I kept waiting for something - whether to find one of the numerous \\"witty\\" remarks to strike me as funny or even just to believe what I was reading.  Even with this opinion, I would still have read the book - that's how much I love this author.  I only hope that future books return to his usual excellence.
B008GVD6D8|4.0|Lovely story can not wait to read the rest of the books in this series. Fully entertaining and encompassing book
1594202842|3.0|I love how Amy Chua just takes one extreme view point to stir up controversy.  For me, I think the answer to being a good parent means not being one extreme or the other (tiger mom vs attachment parent).  Amy Chua's husband grew up with what sounds like more laid back, free-spirited parents and he still ended up in the same place, at Yale!
B0051OJG4Q|2.0|I love Julie London's voice, and can listen to her all day.  But not with these CDs.  The sound quality is terrible - you can hear clicks and pops as if you're listening to old scratched records.  I haven't listened to every song on every disc yet, but I just listened to a song with such poor audio quality that it actually sounded like a radio station with heavy static.  You know when you're listening to a distant radio station, and the music fades and there's almost as much static as there is music?  THAT is what it sounded like.  If you have decent speakers (I'm listening to these discs on B&W PM1 stand-mounted speakers), that are at all revealing, don't buy this set unless you're ok listening to static, clicks, pops, and all kinds of noise.  If you don't mind the noise, and you just want a large collection at a relatively small price, then this will work for you.
B008J34466|4.0|i bought this cd for my wife and she really likes it as much as the other Pink \\"Funhouse\\" she has. The girl can really rock.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|Harold Fry is a likeable soul who you yearn to fulfill his goal. His contemplations and explanations of how he has arrived at his current whereabouts are enlightening, occasionally expected, however written with a thorough understanding of emotional processes.<br /><br />There were occasions which appeared far fetched, but this novel was believable on the whole and offered a solace towards the end - good can evolve from situations which don't appear re solvable.
B0094KF4WG|4.0|I guess that in view of the subject matter that details have been omitted to protect those involved. Having said that, to hear it direct from \\"the horses mouth\\" makes it an excellent read, and I am amazed that it all seemed to go as well as it did.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love the second  book.  I can't wait for book three.  What a powerful love story.  I have other Slyvia Day book to read love her writing.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|We are so used to a Reacher who is ready for a fight around every corner, a Reacher whose mind is always busy figuring out details from small bits of information or conversation.  Well, is one does have the latter, and most of the action happens at the end.  I did enjoy it.  It didn't have the same power or intensity of some of Child's earlier novels, but is still better than most of the other books out there.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Really, really enjoyed this book. I cannot wait until Walking Disaster is finally complete. Huge fan of Jamie McGuire now.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I had read Pillars of the Earth, a truly great book and epic.  When I started this one, it seemed slow-ish in the beginning, but it picked up very nicely.  The last half is excellent at keeping you turning the pages and wondering what is going to happen to these well fleshed out characters.  You get completely drawn into their world.  I loved it! After reading something else for a short while, I'm going to start the second series Follett wrote.  These novels make you care.
B0077JK9QM|5.0|Each season gets better and better ! A must see for those who like vampires and suspense and great story lines
B009GENZKS|5.0|As someone who saw Resident Evil: Degeneration, this was a great continuation of the series.  The plot and characters were interesting, there was plenty of action, and the CGI was outstanding.  I highly recommend this movie to fans of anime and the Resident Evil franchise!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|another great book by Cornwell. I didn't see the ending coming. The main character has remained consistant through out all the Scarpeta novels.

B008O2T3O0|5.0|In a surprise departure from minimalistic \\"Eurotrash\\" productions, Zurich opera delivers one of the best Rigolettos in modern history, and perhaps the best Rigoletto ever recorded. All components of a blast performance came together: brilliant musical interpretation, phenomenal cast, and thoughtful, classical, and at the same time fresh directing. Peotr Beczala proves that he is not only the best Lensky ever but also one of the best Dukes. Elena Mosuc is a Beverly Sills' reincarnation. Laszlo Polgar's (Sparafucile) phenomenal base gave me chills. Despite of his age, a stage veteran Leo Nucci delivers vocally strong and dramatically wholesome and convincing performance that almost brought me to tears despite of the fact that I always disliked this opera with a mean \\"freak\\" as a central character. This is a recording one pulls from a shelf and watches again. Grab and run until the price goes up.
B003O86FMW|5.0|An intriguing follow-up to the hunger games.  Not a new storyline but delivered in a unique way.  Will definitely be finishing the story of Katniss Everdeen in the final novel.

B000002KAT|5.0|Van Morrison is responsible for 4 or 5 of the century's top 20 albums, and yet none even scratch the miraculous heights of Astral Weeks.<br /><br />You have to wonder whether the 31 studio albums that Van Morrison has produced since 1968 haven't been a vain attempt to reunite with whatever insane force had worked its way through his lungs and his fingers that summer.<br /><br />This is not the type of album that you judge based on syncopation or acoustic sonority or other academic nonsense. This isn't even the type of album that you evaluate on the basis of its tracks. Anyone who says \\"I like this track but not that one\\" hasn't listened to Astral Weeks carefully enough, because it is the album as a whole and not the collection of tracks where the miraculous heights are found.<br /><br />This is the type of album that people couldn't help but to play day after day, week after week, hour after hour, until their eardrums and soul were melting and until they were finally compelled to abandon their logical trajectory and take up a career in the service of music.<br /><br />I don't want to say more, because I'd be apt to drown this album in superlatives. You just need to listen to it.
B009NPM5Y2|5.0|A musical using rock music! Cool concept. Funny and entertaining. A nice movie that doesn't make you think to much but keeps you entertained.

0812984412|2.0|If you've read other reviews, then you know the way the book is constructed: six narratives in different times and places from the 19th century through a post-apocalyptic future spin out from the earliest to the latest and then back down again.  As author Mitchell explains it, the construct is an attempt to illustrate what it would look like if a mirror were placed at the end of a book and you continued into a second half that took you back to the beginning.<br /><br />So the question is, how do the individual stories stand up, and do the connections work and enhance the overall storyline?  For me, the individual stories were variable.  The first, featuring Adam Ewing, a San Francisco lawyer on a difficult 19th-century ocean journey that shows him the evils of slavery and oppression of native people by colonizers, is overly earnest and, in its second part, marred by an unbelievable plot twist.<br /><br />After the first part of the Ewing story, it's a pleasure to move on to the tart comedy of the 1930s tale of Robert Frobisher, a ne'er-do-well young musician with an omnivore's sexual tastes.  Then there's an unexpected jump to a crusading journalist in 1970s California named Luisa Rey.  This story is written in a thriller style, as Luisa attempts to uncover corporate wrongdoing at a nuclear power plant.<br /><br />Back to acerbic comedy, British style, as we move to the 1990s and Tim Cavendish, a struggling publisher whose life is transformed when one of his authors commits a spectacular public murder.  The fifth and sixth stories are completely different; one set in a 22nd-century authoritarian corporate-controlled state (apparently Korea) where people live to consume and all real and practical work is performed by replicants, and the other in a far future post-apocalyptic Hawaii, where the same evils of slavery and oppression from the Adam Ewing story seem to be beginning yet again.<br /><br />While there is some intriguing storytelling, the preachiness is often annoying and the messaging downright ham-fisted.  Corporations, materialism, racism: all bad; thanks, got it.  Is that all there is?  Well, no.  There is also a vague suggestion that the protagonist in each story is a transmuted soul from the previous tale(s).  But this theme isn't developed and its point is never made clear.  Is it that souls can change over time?  Well, maybe so, if you believe in reincarnation, but nothing is made of this.  So the connections between the stories end up being tenuous and not particularly compelling.  Each storyline just evaporates into the next.  The connection ends up being Mitchell's oft-repeated lesson that human beings' natural striving makes us civilized, but ultimately destroys us.  For me, that was a lukewarm proposition to float these stories on.<br /><br />I had a bigger problem with the bad guys in the book.  I'll try to talk about that without being spoiler-y.  In sum, the bad guys are just too over the top and do things that don't make any sense in their context.  A man is imprisoned and abused in a nursing home in a fashion that is inexplicable if the operators wanted to stay out of prison, let alone keep operating.  Executives in a corporation go on a killing spree to avoid a story coming out, but they go after their multiple targets in spectacularly sloppy and attention-getting ways.  Another bad buy decides to fleece a victim without knowing what assets the victim is carrying.  That would be fine if the fleecing was a quickie job, but this one requires a dangerous journey, a lengthy time period and risky methodology.  These aspects of the plot required way too much of a suspension of disbelief and made serious stories just seem silly.<br /><br />The expectations built in round one of each of the six stories were dashed by each story's round two, and the letdown feeling just increased with each successive resolution.nnoying and the messaging downright ham-fisted.

B000025D7S|5.0|I have looked for this CD for many years after viewing the recording of it on a TV documentary.  I cannot tell you the delight I have experienced at finally finding it & being able to listen to all the songs, recorded by artists such as Kate Bush, Peter Gabrielle, Sting, Cher & the likes of which you don't expect to sing Gershwin.  Each of the artists were truly \\"hand picked\\" for the song they sang & it is surprising & often breathtaking to hear them sing music that is not their genre & to do it so very very well.  I am truly in love with this album.
0385344333|3.0|I like the Jack Reacher series by Lee Child... a lot.  Unfortunately, the last few installments have been uneven in terms of quality.  Some of the episodes advanced the Reacher character and story, while others felt more like placeholders tossed out to keep up the \\"book per year\\" pace.  A Wanted Man started out in the placeholder category for me.  But by the end, it had picked up sufficiently to keep me turning pages past the point where I would have turned out the light.<br /><br />A Wanted Man starts out with Reacher in the middle of Nebraska at night, standing on the side of a freeway, hitchhiking his way to Virginia.  After 90 minutes, he finally gets picked up by a trio who are supposedly headed to Chicago.  But Reacher quickly figures out that the two guys in the car are not who they claim to be, and the woman is an unwilling passenger.  He also understands that he's now an additional hostage, and the wheels start turning in his mind... who are they, what did they do, where are they going, and most of all, how can he rescue the woman and escape?<br /><br />The story started out on the slow side, in my opinion.  The \\"action\\" shifts back and forth between Reacher's dilemma and the crime scene involving the two men who picked him up.  I know that Reacher is highly analytical, but the scene descriptions and Reacher's machinations are overly drawn out.  The detail didn't make up for the lack of pace.  But once Reacher makes his escape and hooks up with the authorities (on his terms, not theirs), things started to get somewhat more interesting.  Reacher's attitude begins to show up, and I enjoyed the tension between what the FBI agent knew she should do with Reacher vs. what she ended up doing.  The various twists were interesting, and took the story in a direction I didn't expect.  Having said that, I wasn't overly thrilled with the ending, as it seemed that there were still a large number of unknowns and loose ends that weren't resolved.<br /><br />I hate to say it, but the Reacher series might have hit the point of \\"so what\\"... Seventeen books in a series is a lot, and it's hard to keep the stories and plots fresh.  I still like Reacher as a character, and I have no doubt I'll read the next one that Child is working on, Never Go Back.  But it'll be a library book read, and I won't be overly concerned about where I'm at on the hold list.<br /><br />(P.S. - Casting Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher in the movie version of One Shot?  Really?  Did the movie execs or directors ever *read* a Jack Reacher novel? Worst casting decision ever...)<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Library<br />Payment: Freet, but the Reacher series might have hit the point of \\"so what\\"... Seventeen books in a series is a lot, and it's hard to keep the stories and plots fresh.  I still like Reacher as a character, and I have no doubt I'll read the next one that Child is working on, Never Go Back.  But it'll be a library book read, and I won't be overly concerned about where I'm at on the hold list.<br /><br />(P.S. - Casting Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher in the movie version of One Shot?

B009439HEY|3.0|While I am thrilled that S. Hackett has such love for this classic material, the final product is not special enough or different enough to be anything definitive.  Much time and care was obviously taken, to relearn these songs, and even recreate many of the keyboard and guitar tones, to match the originals.  These versions have consistently high sound quality, and the performances are all just about perfect (in tuning and timing.)  This is one place where I feel it detracts from the originals.  These new versions sound like a very tight cover band, performing these songs very well.  But to me, they are missing the emotion and dynamics which were just as important as the compositions themselves.  Also, these versions really give me renewed appreciation for how amazing Peter & Phil were as vocalists.  Lastly, while the original tones were closely approached, the instruments and care that Steve and Tony worked out on the originals shine and pop, compared to these re-dos.  You can't beat the acoustic pianos, and vintage synths, and weird xylophones that they used.<br /><br />This album has given me a new appreciation for classic Genesis - I'm gonna go listen to the real thing right now!
B00138Z97C|5.0|A voice for the ages! This set is wonderful. I am luckier than most who buy this set as I have the original Lps with the texts etc. Lack of texts is the only draw back but for this price you can't expect everything.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I reccomend downloading this app. it is very fun to play! however, you should download the original so you can learn how to play!<br /><br />Follow Aussenon on twitter!
B00005NQCB|5.0|This was a tape I had long ago, and then purchased on CD (since been rip'd to my computer). It's still as good as it was back then. Electric Blue and Crazy may be songs you remember if you were into pop music. Still one of my favorites.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|What a wonderful experience this movie is.  It's for anyone who was ever moved by any type of music.  it's beautifully done, you go thru so many emotions while watching it and tho I don't collect DVD's, I will get this one.  Its's an amazing story.....
0062127241|5.0|Truly one of the best bios I've ever read. Inspiring work from a gifted giant of a man. Great work Pete.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Great movie! It was entertaining, smart and funny. True to cannon enough to satisfy long time DS fans, yet new enough to enjoy a innovative take of the orginally brilliant yet now tired plot!<br />I highly recommend this movie to everyone who enjoyed those weekday afternoons, too young to notice campy actors, yet scared enough to enjoy it over and over again and hold the DS experience so deeply into our middle age years!
1401324649|5.0|An amusing and most interesting book relating ,in alternate chapters, the escape of a 100 year old man on his birthday from a nursing home, and his adventures with criminals, and episodes from his past, during which he comes into contact with various famous and infamous leaders.<br />Somewhat on the style of \\"Forrest Gump\\", but funnier and historically more interesting.<br />Altogether a super read.
B0031RS4UM|4.0|Action packed. usual jack reached novel .a little unbelievable in plot and spot the obvious error near the end. How did they get the dynamite out without anyone knowing?
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I'm a retired middle school teacher and still enjoy keeping up with young adult fiction. After reading The Hunger Games, I couldn't wait to read the sequels.  All three books are well written, and, I have to add, very well edited. (Too many books today, even ones from NY publishing houses, miss grammar errors and word misusage in the narrative.) Character development had excellent consistency; plot detail was in the realm of JK Rowling's creativity.  I appreciated that Collins used very little graphic violence in the Arena in the first book, and human compassion triumphed. The middle book was darker and more violent. The final book disappointed me because it was all about violence and the deaths of thousands of innocent people. The wrong people die.  Yes, war is like that, but the author was in control of this war.  The positive themes of love, loyalty, and compassion did not come through strongly enough.  Mockingjay was not as enjoyable or uplifting as the first book.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|At first I didn't know what all the hype was about. Now ...lol ... I can't put the game away
B0077ATSZE|4.0|This is a remarkable tour-de-force of dramatic acting by an equally remarkable cast. Anchoring the whole movie is the intense performance by Thomas Horn as Oskar Schell, a young boy thrown into a life-changing situation with which he must make the best. Supporting his performance is a stellar cast including Tom Hanks, as Thomas Schell, Oskar's father and Sandra Bullock as Linda Schell, Oskar's mother.<br /><br />This movie is heavy, emotional, and filled with angst; young Oskar is very intelligent and driven to resolve the challenge he believes has been left for him by the death of his dad on 9/11.<br /><br />The movie is rated PG-13 but I would suggest its heavy drama will require a very mature 13 year old. One thing I can say is the movie offers closure at the end and leaves the viewer with a feeling of completion.<br /><br />I would suggest one consider renting before buying.
B0086700CM|5.0|Its a great game because it entertains the whole family. The graphics are great and its very FUN!! Please trust this review. It is a true review.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|when I first started the game it was awesome so I bought the double coin thing and it wont work Im really frustrated I don't really want to play anymore
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I really loved this game.  I'm now waiting for Enigmatis 2 to come out.  I want to see if part 2 is just as fun and interesting as the first version.
B0027MJU00|3.0|This story is about a family living meal to meal in pretty desperate conditions. I enjoy reading books where the characters live outside my realm of experience but it's pretty depressing to read only of extreme anxiety.  In this book there was very little relief from the doom and gloom from start to finish.  Maybe I should have expected this from the title but if you are hoping for some comic relief best skip this novel.
B003719G40|4.0|I like learning more about my personality type as well as others' types.  I am not currently in a relationship so I couldn't test this book out \\"real-time\\".  However, the book contains a lot of thoughtful information that I will certainly keep in mind for future relationships.  (Note: this book is helpful for familial relationships and friendships, too.)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can't believe I waited so long to read this book...couldn't put it down :) Amazing, starting book two now.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|one of the first apps i got for my kindle fire. i play every chance i get. i've only had my fire for a month but i'm on level 44 already.<br />the most amazing part is that it was free!!
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|This is a good book but my favaret was the last straw<br /><br />I like the book because it is like a persanal story and it has fogeses on one thing the brother and that is a good thing to write about so write more books and good book thanks for signing it
B000YJ85BI|2.0|I like the characters a lot, but the story is basically about humans plotting around other humans. May as well not set the story in space. Very dull ending.
B001JI7WTO|5.0|This movie was great. I really enjoyed watching this on my laptop and to be able to watch it anytime I want.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am not much of a reader, let alone science fiction. This book caught my eye because of the simple title and how many 5 star reviews. From the very beginning I was sucked into this world of the silo. I couldn't put the books down. I had to read. I read everywhere. I told people they need to read this book. This book will stay in my thoughts for a long time. I am very sad I am finished with it. I wish it would have more. I think this book should be on everyone's 'bucket list' of books to read. WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008Q09K2U|5.0|Once again, Nelson Demille has written a book that is not only hard to put down, but the character of John Corey gives you a great laugh.<br /><br />Cannot wait for the next one.
B00992CF6W|1.0|This game is fun on the x-box but there is NO WAY I'm paying $7 for ONE GAME. Its WAY overpriced. For one app no one should pay $7. There are free games that are just as good as this one! Maybe if it was like $5 or less I would pay for it, but $7! I'm not wasting my money! LOWER THE PRICE AND I WILL LOVE IT
B009NQKPUW|3.0|While this movie does answer several questions that come from the original Alien movies it raises more questions than it answers.  It also builds too slowly and it is a little longer than necessary.  If you liked the Alien movies it is worth the watch, but it fails to deliver all the goods.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Good but predictable. It's like Twilight with sex minus the wolfpack. Anna is easily dominated even if It's not sexual,but Mr. Grays insecurity surface.
0307361012|2.0|After reading all the jo nesbo previous books was looking forward to the bat!  Sorry but I found it so hard to keep reading.  I cringed at the dreamtime lines.  Got to the stage I  was waiting for crocodile Dundee to pop up in kings cross and give a helping hand with his big knife to&#34;Andrew&#34; and holy..  Holy??  Thank heavens Harry hole returned to his homeland and gave readers some great detective stories.  Hope jussi and co don't feel the need to come to Aussie to solve some crimes!!  Yes I am an Aussie.
B001RNO7C6|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3RUHQIZ7WX42W]][watch the video]<br />I am a graduate student at Purdue and wanted a shoe that I can wear all the time on campus.<br />I was looking for a shoe that can endure cold climate and at the same time doesn't look very bulky like a winter boot.<br />I found this shoe to be wonderfully styled and it has VIBRAM sole which is the best for durability and grip.<br />The upper leather makes it look stylish and I wear it all day on campus with my jeans and other casual dress pants.<br /><br />I have used it for almost a week now and will update how this shoe holds this coming winter. If it holds its quality then I will be purchasing more of this and also update here.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />It has been almost 10 months since I bought it and they have held up really well. They still look great and the sole looks almost new even after extensive use. I use it for day hikes, every day use and they are water repellent.<br />I may have found my favorite shoe.
B0063GORYU|4.0|this is a well made app that I play daily no bugs no glitches .... an actually pause button would be nice though
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is awesome. People who's game's are crashing, its probably just your kindle. I have had no problem with the game. If you like strategy games and/or angry birds, you should get this app.
B0012UHSDO|5.0|Awesome series.  It competes very favorably with my other favorite show, Dexter.  I am totally hooked.  Well acted, well written and well presented!
B0088XQDD4|5.0|I had been waiting for years for Tony Richardson's 1969 production of Hamlet to become available on DVD. It was worth the wait.<br />In my experience Hamlet has fared very well on the big screen, perhaps the best entry of all being Kenneth Branagh's 1996 marvel, and this version is an excellent representative of a strong tradition. The outstanding Nicol Williamson, known also for among other things his performance as Sherlock Holmes in The Seven Percent Solution (1976), another movie that recently came out on DVD after a long period of anticipation, heads a truly fine cast in the leading role.<br />Beyond the novelty of Ophelia being played by Marianne Faithfull, a sweet-voiced pop singer who also happened to be Mick Jagger's love interest around the time of this movie, look for a quite young Anthony Hopkins as the murderous, incestuous King Claudius - perhaps already beginning to hone the eloquent malevolence that was so striking in his Oscar winning performance as Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs more than twenty years later. This is both a movie of substance and a real treat, all the way around.
B008GVD6D8|3.0|Cant help but compare to fifty almost a parallel i like the characters but something missing  can't help but compare the two but a good distraction from the real world nice to have a man in shining armour instead of a tin foil git
B004LWZWGK|3.0|This was not my favorite movie from Christopher Nolan, it was boring and predictable. I think the only good acting that I found on the movie was from Michael Caine(Alfred). It is a good movie, but, i did not liked it so i wont be spending my money on it. Now this is me, if you loved it at the theater then buy it and ignore this. I'm giving 3 stars because of the deal for the movie here, but on the movie itself I give it a 2 1/2.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game but they should just let you build build build without money limits. This Reminds me of the old game Sim City.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|I'm slightly bias as I saw these guys in concert but this is an excellent album with a nice variety of songs and has a slight hard rock bent which is great. Highly recommend
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I would play this game for hours on end, only stopping because my Kindle died. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a little action with their puzzles.
B0085YOD1A|1.0|This battery app lied!I would have very little power left, And it said I had a full battery!It was a waste on my kindle fire.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I feel obligated to read this series now that I've read the first one. This was definitely better than the first, but a little far fetched. Not thrilled.
0525958002|4.0|I know all the singles but own only a couple of albums. The book was an endearing trip through 80s music and the excesses. Taylor comes across as proud if his achievements and does a nice job of putting the DD achievements in perspective. It is surprisingly upbeat, optimistic and positive and a fun, full, fast read.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|What an exciting game. It is easy for the first round. But they do get harder. My Children who are 7 and ten enjoy it as well.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Nice movie. Very entertaining. Certainly worth watching in HD. Science fiction. Decent story. Somewhat long. Acceptable as a family entertainment.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|This movie makes you think about human life and human nature, plus it is about space travel so I think it's pretty cool. It integrates itself really well into the Alien series, but the special effects are wild and the story takes on new dimensions. Some of the stuff is a bit hard to watch, so if you are not into gore-like action be prepared to cover your eyes at least three times. But still, the story around the gore is really intriguing. Though character development is sort of lacking (I don't always feel like I understood character motivations), but again, the story around it sort of makes up for that.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was not interested  in the book, but several of the members of my book club had read the books so I got it on my Kindle and couldn't put it down. The author certainly has a vivid imagination and if you get get beyond the explicit sexual details, there is an interesting story line which develops as you read books 2+3. Would highly recommend.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Love watching no reservations with Anthony. Getting to know where he came from is the icing on the cake...read this book its a insightful and personal look into the life of a culinary lifer.
B0091REZMW|4.0|its a very entertaining game if you like hidden object games. it has many levels for free which makes it even more exciting. the only thing that Sucks is that the energy goes fast.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I have been astounding my Android friends with the ease and value of this app for a long time. I could NOT do without it. LOVE being able to just type<br />in address to ANY browser ;-)
B00913DPW2|5.0|This brings me back to the days of Myst.  I love games that really stretch your thinking & this one is hard!  I admit I did use the photos to find the last 2 puzzle pieces & the walkthrough was helpful when I was really stumped.  I think the game is do-able without either helps but I was so anxious to move on that I was compelled to use them.<br /><br />There were a few minor glitches, one specifically in the front room of the house where occasionally I could not leave the room but I found by clicking on the Menu & then back into the game that the problem was quickly & easily solved.<br /><br />I finished the game in about 2 days of fairly heavy play, then moved on to The Haunt 2 which I also loved!<br /><br />I love love love these types of games - PLEASE make more!!!!
0618918248|5.0|\\"The God Delusion\\" is, I think, more than anything else, a call to non-believers. It is not written to convert the religious masses, though there have been a few cases of which I know. Professor Dawkins asks for each of us to arm ourselves with knowledge, and fight for the rights of secular society against those pushing against us, it seems from all fronts.
0316228532|5.0|Not sure why no one else seems to like this book but I have enjoyed it immensely.  only problem with it was there were so many characters at first that I had a hard time keeping them straight but I figured it out soon enough.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|watched this with my husband who is British and we enjoyed it. it is about overcoming fear and prejudice and finding happiness. it is a bit subtle and quieter than I thought it would be and nothing vulgar. more for adults than for teens or young adults
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Excellent book, an eye opener, reading it makes you understand yourself and others. The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom (A Toltec Wisdom...  It is, like the title, a personal guide to freedom. Freedom from years of conditioning and the wrong perception of how to live our life. Easy to understand, it goes straight to the core of our emotions and continuous dialogue, allowing us to make changes and tweak our psyche to improve ourselves and enjoy life to the fullest. I recommend this book to everyone who wants to be better, to get satisfaction of living, and to fulfill past and present dreams. Thank you Don Miguel Ruiz.
0452273331|5.0|After reading through the comments (especially a lot of the \\"one stars\\"), it basically seems like the cult of personality surrounding Rand and her philosophies has led to the heated reviews of this book. It seems to me that a lot of people are raving about how brilliant her ideas are (because they agree with her) or how terrible she is (because they disagree with her). While this is fine, my comment will simply address THE CONTENTS OF THE BOOK as someone who picked it up without knowing anything about Ayn Rand and as someone writing a review strictly from what I read.<br /><br />While I do not agree with Rand's overall philosophies, I will simply say this: This is the best written novel I have ever read with an enchanting and complicated story. Yes, the characters are unrealistic caricatures of the philosophies they represent. The book is an allegory - it's supposed to be that way. All allegories from all philosophers I've ever read (as someone studying philosophy in university) are this way. The characters represent ideas in process of framing  the philosophy of Objectivism.<br /><br />The book is long, and with a full course load in college it took about four months to read. Even if you think the ideas are crazy, it is still a brilliant and tasteful story that is filled with insightful allegories. The writing flows beautifully.<br /><br />On a final note, I must include that I learned a lot about architecture from this book. It really helped me appreciate the design and effort that goes into the buildings I enter every week and helped me see beautiful art in everyday life. It also got me started in a rudimentary ability to recognize certain styles in architecture - which is in and of itself something priceless to walk away from a book with.
030759565X|5.0|I've been a fan of SK for a little while, so I was excited to see that the book is similar to her blog. Approachable recipes that aren't laden in butter, and don't require specialty ingredients. Since I received the book (4 days ago) I've made a few recipes, which makes this my second most used cookbook, next to the Joy of cooking
0141182865|4.0|Comic masterpiece that pokes fun at everyone you know and New Orleans culture. Unsung hero of satire. It's a shame the author killed himself, because this was such a great book of witty and tasteful humor.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I couldn't put this book down.  It was so good I went back and read some of the author's early works.  This is a page turner!
1451650728|5.0|Which was also written by David Mack.  Coincidence?  I think not.<br /><br />Mack is simply a fabulous writer.  He is that rare author who excels both at characterization and setting, making both come alive and seem as real as anything going on beyond the pages.  I've bought most of the TNG and Typhon Pact books since Destiny, and though I have found some of them to be fairly decent, I haven't sat down and read a Trek book cover-to-cover since I finished the last Destiny book - that's how absorbed I was in this novel.  It is a particularly rewarding journey if you like Data - and let's be honest, who doesn't?  I thought the way that situation was handled (I'm trying to avoid overly-obvious spoilers, even though I'm sure most people can figure out what happens at the end of this book) was both plausible and not cheesy, as many such storylines have a tendency to be.<br /><br />My one (minor) quibble is that I just really do not like the way Mack writes Picard.  The Enterprise scenes in the last third of the book were the weakest in the novel, chiefly because Mack writes Picard as a morose and overserious man who sits in a chair and gives orders (that are almost always suggested to him first by random junior officers).  There's so much more to his character, and especially given that TNG went out of its way to show him evolving from the humorless stiff he was in the early seasons, it seems regressive to see him so flat here.  I hope that was just a byproduct of the fact that Picard was really only in this book because he had to be, and that he is better written in the rest of this trilogy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love Pinterest! It's an awesome way to find new ideas and projects. My only complaint is that there isn't something that pops up telling you that you've spent waaaaaay too much time on the site.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|If you like Sherlock Holmes, you will like this book.  All of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Holmes stories in one nice package.  I can't read the stories without picturing Jeremy Brett as Holmes.  Every fan has her or his own special Sherlock.  The stories don't change so if you are new to Conan Doyle's stories, have fun and if you haven't read them in some time you may be surprised as to what they actually say.  Either way...Holmes, Watson and Mrs Hudson all await your attention their Baker Street residence.  Enjoy.
B009IKPOUO|4.0|I gave this 4 stars because of the chit chat on some of the tracks. Otherwise, Barbra is still the greatest voice in my opinion, and this album is a pleasure to listen to.
B008WCP2KG|1.0|other than to say this is the worst movie I have ever seen.  I wish I could get back the last two hours of my life.  WHAT A WASTE OF TIME. If I could have given this movie a minus sign I would have.  There was no plot and none of the characters had any redeemable qualities.  JUST HORRIBLE!!!!!
B008AX1HD8|4.0|The Bat, at first it seemed a bit like a travelogue for Australia, but as you get further in it give insights into Hole's character and motivation and why he is he way he is, having read all the other Harry Hole books it was a great way to finish (hope not) the series, more harry please
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love it<br />it is very fun to play use to play this game as a child and love being able to again
B008ALAHA4|5.0|My wife and I both have Mac Books but mine has the new charging port. This piece made it easier for me to share chargers.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Life can be complicated....This is a book about that. One day, you're just going about your business and then the world tilts. The writing is clean and concise. It will tug at your heart and make you think. You won't be able to put this book down until the very last page.
B002SQNM9A|5.0|Another masterpiece by Taylor Swift.  Very well done with good songs, but short with only 6 tracks. However those songs were very, very well done.  Hopefully next year Taylor will put out a Christmas Album with her normal 18 to 22 songs.  As short as it is, I still fully recommend it and rate it with 5 stars.  She has a wonderful ability to re-engineer classic songs and make them sound even greater; which is a talent I hope she uses in her next, and longer, Christmas Album. And that she stays away from duets.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this game was super fun. never froze or slowed down. can't wait for the next one!! well worth the wait I'm sure
B008XNZMOU|4.0|The World already knows what a geat album this is.  However, for the sake of doing a review, I'll add my voice to the thousands already loving it.  The band stays in the background for the most part allowing Taylor's beautiful voice to be itself.  Taylor's does not need to do duets, they only mediate her beautiful voice and those duets take a star off my original five-star rating for the album. I guess the optimal Taylor Album for me would be just Taylor and her guitar with maybe a violin in the background occasionally....
B005IQZB14|5.0|I heard about this book through an interview on PRI and purchased my Kendal edition from Amazon.  Since I live in the Northwest and have in my younger years enjoyed camping and hiking in the Northwest.  I have never tried to take such an exciting hike as the Picific Coast Trail although My wife and I talked about doing parts of it here in Washington.  Now that my age and health will not allow such activities I have enjoyed reading about this daring young person and her journey on the trail.  For her to try this on her own is excitement in itself and to be able to experience the trip through her writing is wonderful.  I have not finished the book yet, but look forward to the next time I can read more...
B008673ZAQ|5.0|amazing!!! This book in on fire! Couldn't stop reading until I read the last page!! I highly recommend, it is truly wonderful
B006QNDDHW|5.0|slide:ology  by Nancy Duarte<br /><br />slide:ology The Art and Science of Creating Great Presentations is an awesome book.  This books covers everything that you need to transform you from a boring presenter to one that people want to listen to. It covers what color schemes to use, how to structure each slide, the correct amount of data for each slide and the best fonts to use. Basically, this book taught me the way I was doing presentations was wrong. No wonder I preferred to white board instead! The presentations that I have created since are much better. I continue to use this as my reference guide for creating great presentations. I give this book 5 out of 5. Highly recommended!
0451169514|3.0|Okay so maybe I am like the very last person on earth to read this book, but what can I say? I hate clowns. It took some courage for me to finally read this book. Now that I have, I know why I didn't read it before. Don't get me wrong, this book is excellent and although it is long, it is possibly one of the most intriguing Stephen King novels I have ever read. The plot keeps twisting and as the story unfolds, the double story line becomes more and more interesting, drawing you in and refusing to let go.<br /><br />I have to say, even though clowns have never been my favorite, for one reason or the other, the general public seems to enjoy having the living crap scared out of them and I guess I am no exception. Although I couldn't sleep at all the night I finished reading this book and I will never look at a rain gutter the same way again, I appreciate that this book was powerful enough to scare me. Well played Mr. King, Well played.
1469984202|5.0|I realized early on in reading this that the concept of \\"what happens after the bottom drops out of the world\\" had been taken to new heights. Brilliantly told tale, excellent editing, and a ending just begging for more. Loved it!!!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|I have to say that I enjoy these books more to the 50 shades series. The stories are similar but with small differences that make this story better in my opinion. There is still a lot of sex, but not to the level of 50 shades. It is pretty unrealistic but its supposed to be entertainment not actual. I think the writing is very good and the story engaging. Cant wait for the third one!
B008GVD6D8|4.0|After bared to you, couldn't wait for book 2 as I needed to know the rest of Gideon & Eva's story, was a tad disappointed as the book was more emotional than story based, I hope there's a happy ending and we don't have to wait until may 2013 for the final book, still loved the characters though!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|While this book is not expertly written, its fun and puts you in the mood for romance! I am surprised the copy editor didn't catch all the British-isms, since the story takes place in Seattle. Seems like a ridiculous oversight, but its worth a read, and I plan to read the trilogy.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|have really enjoyed this game. colorful and easy but does require concentration. different from other games. hours of relaxing fun.  Update:  have just finished the entire puzzle and have started over.  Hundreds of puzzles from easy to very hard.  Best game I've played in a long time.  graphics are great, game works well on Kindle Fire.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|Monster life is epic!! son't listen to the bad reviews. You can train, clean, entertain etc. The monsters sometimes cost a lot of money but they're usually cute.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|[[ASIN:B0076DCT2G The Panther (John Corey)]]<br />This is Nelson DeMille at his best. John Corey is one of my favorite characters and the stories in the Corey series are really fun to read.
B005LAIHSG|2.0|Having had avoided the Twilight films like the plague after seeing the first to get what all the fuss was about, this was only my second time seeing Kristen Stewart at work. My opinion of her has not changed. This take on the Snow White story, mixed in with a liberal dose of fantasy battle, is profoundly flawed. Stewart is horribly cast in the lead, incapable of showing any more expression than her usual sullenness, and cannot act even if her life depended on it. The movie would have benefitted from a director who knew what he was doing, a better crafted story that wasn't trying to pander to the audience coming to see the leading lady, and a leading actress capable of emotional range. Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron, who are much better than the material deserves, should be in a better movie. If it weren't for these two actors, my opinion of the film would have been even lower.
1451650728|4.0|Persistence of Memory is the first of a new trilogy by David Mack. It takes place 4 years after the events of Star Trek: Nemesis. No, that's not Data on the cover, it's actually his father, Doctor Noonian Soong. We find out that like his mentor, Ira Graves, Soong had plans to subvert death. He moved his mind into his newest and most advanced android. The book is full of Soong type android appearances: Juliana O'Donnell, B-4, Lore, and Lal. If, like me, this hits your cybernetic trek sweet-spot, then I don't think you'll find it disappointing.<br /><br />I was a bit lost about some of the Memory Beta, non-cannon characters and events, but David Mack handles the transitions and exposition well. I felt that the weakest part of the book was the middle section which switches to the first person narrative of Dr. Soong.<br /><br />-----------------------<br /><br />It was a fun two hour read on a cold and rainy Saturday morning. There *is* a major spoiler in this book. It's been revealed in some online reviews. Don't read them. Go in unspoiled. As Adrian Monk would say, \\"You'll thank me later.\\"
B00005221M|5.0|In regards to the original film:<br /><br />Exceptional adaptation of the novel changes elements of the story, but still succeeds wildly. A brilliantly casted film, with outstanding production values and direction. Daniel Day-Lewis is the best actor alive today, and his take on Hawkeye is a fiercely passionate one. Madeleine Stowe as Cora gives a strong, tenacious performance. Russell Means and Eric Schweig as Hawkeye's adopted father and brother are ideally cast, giving their performances much depth. And Wes Studi, as the villainous Magua, is nonetheless compelling to watch, and the reasons for his anger completely understandable.<br /><br />As to the director's cut, it's unfortunate that Mann felt the need to meddle with the original film. Fortunately I still have the widescreen VHS version.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I laughed so hard and I cried tears of joy and love!  Steve Carell does an awesome job as the voice of Gru and the little yellow minions are adorable and so endearing!  One of my favorite phrases...It's sooooo fluuuffffffyyyyyy!
B004FRX0MY|1.0|It is unfortunate you cannot give zero stars.  There is NO REASON that this app should not allow the user to select where the songs and associated data are stored.  NO REASON. I have a 64GB SD card and cannot store any of my Amazon Music on it (unless I use root to mount the SD card folder on the internal storage.) KitKat allows an app to use an SD card, just not read folders created by other apps. Amazon, please allow your paying customers to select where they want to store THEIR music.<br /><br />Although it is nice to have the ability to download Prime Music, the decision to store the encrypted music in the Amazon Music app data directory (Android/data/com.amazon.mp3) not only means that it will be stored in internal storage, but will also get backed up by apps like Titanium Backup. If you keep a history of multiple backup files, you end up with multiple copies of the same Amazon Prime Music you have downloaded. Since the music is encrypted, why not allow the user to select where it is stored?<br /><br />Worst of all, if you need to reinstall the Amazon Music app, all of the encrypted Prime Music you have downloaded will no longer play and must be deleted and re-downloaded. I do not know how the Prime Music encryption key is created, but it would be appreciated if there was a way to re-authenticate Prime Music already downloaded.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|When I first heard that they were working on an Avengers movie, a crossover of several Marvel movie characters, I was skeptical.  I really didn't know what to think, but after having seen some of the Marvel movies, my expectations were low.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />This movie was awesome.  The actors fit their respective parts very well; the visuals are stunning, but are not a lame excuse to gloss over the story being told.<br /><br />What I liked about it was that the heroes all have their own agendas, their own reasons for being involved, and as a result, there is conflict in the group from the very beginning.  You believe that their battles and arguments with each other have real genuine weight as each of them is trying to follow their own path.  As Bruce Banner notes, in the beginning, they are not a team, but rather a volatile chemical mixture, a time bomb.<br /><br />And yet, when the earth really needs them, they don't merely set aside their differences for the sake of the greater good; they actually become a real team.<br /><br />I especially like that, when the Hulk first shows up, he is downright dangerous, a complete monster, not a good guy at all.<br /><br />I am amazed at how many scenes I saw in this movie that could have been very melodramatic, but were somewhat downplayed.  I liked this, because it made them all the more believable as characters, rather than comic book cliches.<br /><br />Were there some weaknesses to the movie?  Yes.  For one thing, I felt that there really needed to be more development for Captain America, at least in the beginning.  This is a man almost 3/4 of a century beyond his time, and yet we see very little of him trying to adjust to his new life.  There's some in the deleted scenes, and I realize some had to be cut for time, but still, I would have liked to have seen Cap having to deal with more future shock.<br /><br />Second, the story really isn't all that original.  It's the old cliche \\"bad guy trying to take over the world\\" (\\"OF COURSE!\\" - M. Bison), mixed with an alien invasion.  But, even so, it still works.  It's not The Lord of the Rings or The Odyssey, but it doesn't need to be.<br /><br />Third, I really felt Natasha needed a Russian accent.  Given that she was born in Russia, was a Russian spy for most of her early career, and still does a lot of her work in Russia, it would have helped to sell her past a bit better.<br /><br />Overall, this is one fun movie to watch.  I have to say, this is one of my favorite superhero movies of all times.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The book was good but not the best. It can be slow at times but they don't last long. If you don't like books that are set up journals then you might not like this book. But it is totally worth reading.
1423113462|5.0|It's hard to say, but this branch of the Greek demigod series is even better than the original Percy Jackson series! I didn't think it was possible to top Riordan's previous achievements, but \\"by golly,\\" he's done it! Bravo, Mr. Riordan!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I am certainly not a professional literary critic, but I can still spot a poorly written novel.  The way it is written would make this book a fine youth novel, but the content certainly makes it adult material.  It was almost painful to read.
0345803485|1.0|I'm sorry, but I really did try to like this novel. I've read better romance novels that I've bought for a nickel at a flea market. I swear that if that girl bit her lip, gasped, or spoke of her \\"inner goddess\\" one more time I was going to jump into the book myself and slap some sense into her! Ok, I'm done ranting. If you're on the fence, just keep moving.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I liked the game and it has kept my interest longer than most similar games. It is some what similar to Unblock Classic and Parking Cars, as these games are the same concept.
0756405890|5.0|The story is amazing! It reminds me of a rpg game with all of the side stories in one. However, each has its merit and adds to the whole of the main plot.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Greek mythology meets fantasy. Suspensful, incredibly well written and hilarious! You will not regret reading this series.<br />I loved it!
B0096PAA6E|5.0|I'm not sure why it's taken me so long to discover my fellow Austinite's wonderful music.  I absolutely love this album.  I'm really loving Bright Lights, Numb, and Travis County.  Buy this alubm!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to get to book three! Borrowing them on Prime, but not sure if I can wait until next month! Never thought Book Two could top the first! But, it did!

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|this app is great! simple to use. I especially like the easy to see buttons. I nerd glasses to see but with the large format glasses are optional.
B005HJAOLY|4.0|A great short story from king. Really gross in parts which I loved, he really knows how to make people squirm.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like it so far..... the graphics are nice and clear and I like that you an two finger zoom.
B0035JNRYY|5.0|This is one of those movie's that I can watch over and over without getting bored. Although a scandalous in theme in the end the high road is taken.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I have not yet finished, am about 60% thru.  I am somewhat disappointed, finding it difficult to stay focused.  Seems to lack continuity. I find myself bored and can only get thru 1 or 2 chapters at a setting.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Grissom's writing transported me to this time and place, and gave me new insight into the interwoven worlds of slave-holding families and their enslaved workers. Great character development and gripping plot! I initially was a bit disappointed with the conclusion, but in retrospect, any happily-ever-after-for-all ending would have been completely unrealistic.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it! it has so many different versions and it even reads to you. it has all different types of plans to read the Bible though and it has highlighting and note taking on there too!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|The only bad thing about this book is that it merely continues the story, without any strings tied up or stories finished.  It's simply a bridge from the previous book to the next, which is frustrating.  My whole family loves the series and enjoyed the story, but now have to wait a year for it to continue!
B008PQ8XZK|3.0|A very well-written book, in my opinion.  The plot line is good with just enough characters in the story so you can keep track of them.  You get a good impression of life in U.K. during and after WWII and the hardships and complicated lives people led.  It is also a well-written book with some challenging vocabulary.  The book is well organized and the characters very realistic.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is really easy to learn and a whole lot of fun! Although it is a little bit addictive...
B009DJB8I2|5.0|Definitely a must-have for any Portal collector or hardcore fan. It comes with a TF2 Promo code (Which gives you a box that is \\"sealed until a later date\\" along with a DOTA 2 Invite with it's own promo code. (3 Rare Weapons)<br /><br />I was also rather amused by the disc covers. Each disc is one of the four core's eyes. (Disc 1: Wheatley, Disc 2: Rick, etc.) I was expecting just a generic disc with \\"Portal 2: Disc X\\" on it.<br /><br />Others on here seem to be complaining about the casing, but mine seems fine. It came in perfect condition, and the only complaint I have is that it's a bit hard to open/close. Seems durable though.
B00913DPW2|3.0|fun game with astonishing graphics and very difficult, which I also like. the only thing that really upset me was the ridiculous doughnut. all the work that you went through making this great game, and all the work we, players went through deserved a lot more than that.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Great action and suspense. Loved the cast of the show. Am waiting and excited to see the next one as soon as I can.

B006GHA9QQ|1.0|Imagine Tim Burton or David Lynch getting the go ahead to do a sequal to Phantom, only with the sensibilities of Ed wood, and you get an idea of what this is like. Add production design inspired by Hieronymus Bosch and you have...oh, I don't know. Words escape me. Sitting there watching this, I must have looked like an audience member watching \\"Springtime for Hitler\\" in Mel Brook's The Producers. If thie hadn't been linked to Webber's THE PHANTOM, I might have enjoyed it as an incredibly tacky spectacle, like the Rocky Horror Picture Show. However,for me, it sullies the memories of the original, and it's going to take some time to forget this ever existed.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Let's begin with the good news: stunning special effects, great cinematography, decent cast.  That's the good.  The bad is a bizarre and far from plausible plot that leaves the viewer lost and frequently confused.  Fans of the original Alien movies even struggle to link the film to what we have seen in the past.  It is a bit more than frustrating.  Naturally we can excuse more advanced technology and cooler looking ships and so on (its been decades since Alien premiered, after all).  But come on.  The obvious dialog \\"when you spend a trillion dollars, then we can follow your agenda\\" (or words to the effect uttered by Charlie Theron's character) is hardly original or even interesting.  The rapidity of death to key characters in matters of moments is also a bit annoying.  And the fate of Theron's character?  Really?  That was a bit disappointing to say the least.<br /><br />I'd have to call this an average film by recent sci-fi standards.  Buy it for $15 or less and it is a sufficient guilty pleasure.
B004EPZ00M|3.0|For the first half hour or so Johnny English Reborn is a surprisingly funny spy spoof that's a huge improvement on the dire first big screen outing for Rowan Atkinson's hopeless yet supremely self-confident spy who was originally dreamt up for a series of credit card adverts and seemed ill-suited for anything longer than 30 seconds. Where that misfired more than it hit, the sequel begins rather well as the now disgraced spy is called out of his retreat in a Tibetan monastery (where he's learning, among other things, the martial art of dragging boulders with his testicles) by a reluctant MI7 to uncover an assassination plot aimed at the Chinese premier.<br /><br />Some of the jokes are out of date - his sparring with Gillian Anderson's unimpressed spymaster, all impeccable but monotonous pronunciation, is like a flat rewrite of Judi Dench's scenes in GoldenEye that's 16 years too late - but there's plenty that does raise a smile or the odd laugh, not least a particularly well-executed parkour chase scene across the rooftops and along the dockside of Hong Kong where the joke is that, despite obvious audience expectations, English's ineptitude constantly fails to materialise as he never puts a foot wrong and repeatedly outthinks a killer with a minimum of effort. But once the action leaves Hong Kong it obviously forgets to pack the jokes for the return trip and becomes a tired but watchable run-through of stale routines that weren't that funny when they were being done back in the 60s when people first started making mediocre Bond spoofs - the clumsy would-be knowing banter with a villain over a game of golf, the gadget filled chase scene (here in a motorised wheelchair), the assassination attempts by a ridiculous villain (here an elderly Chinese cleaning lady) survived through dumb luck rather than skill... you've seen it all before, and better done, and compared to the likes of [[ASIN:B0037FUCMQ OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies]] it seems stuck in the last century in the wrong way.<br /><br />There are some compensations, with the biggest surprise how much better Rosamund Pike is here than in her genuine Bond film, Die Another Day, giving a much more natural and appealing performance in a role that's not much more than reaction shots and exposition before turning into the romantic interest just because that's part of the formula. It's a shame that she doesn't get more to do, but that could apply to most of the cast in a comedy that seems to have been made by a director who doesn't really want to do a comedy in a classic case of trying to turn the film he's been hired to make into the different kind of film he'd rather be making instead.<br /><br />That problem is increasingly apparent from the deleted scenes on the Blu-ray and director Oliver Parker's rationale for cutting most of the funnier moments purely to keep the story moving while bizarrely leaving the now redundant and occasionally laborious moments setting them up in the final cut: in this kind of film the story is really nothing more than a near irrelevant coat rack to hang the jokes on, and it's the jokes that should take priority. As he rationalises his decisions as \\"small sacrifices worth making\\" to get to the next mundane plot point you can't help thinking he's the kind of director who'd cut the farting cowboys out of Blazing Saddles because it wasn't really moving the story forward. Not that there's much originality on display in them, but some - an extended walk-through the newly privatised MI7, English so preoccupied with trying out the gadgets in his car that he doesn't notice machine-gun firing killers are chasing him or a throwaway gag with some exploding chewing gum - are much better than what did make the final cut even if they did need a bit of tightening. The same could be said of the deleted scenes presentation as well since the disc doesn't offer the option to skip Parker's near-identical explanations for cutting the jokes out of a comedy.<br /><br />Aside from a decent 25-minute making of and a not particularly funny gag reel the rest of the extras are the usual puff pieces on how Atkinson is the comic Messiah, though his perfectionism is absent from what makes it to the screen in the last two thirds of the movie. Like so many movies shot digitally rather than on film the 2.35:1 widescreen picture quality tends to vary from sharpness (usually in studio scenes and the Hong Kong section) to a rather soft, pallid, undetailed and lifeless look (most of the exteriors) but is acceptable.
0385535147|4.0|John Grisham's THE RACKETEER is a good novel, certainly not great, and definitely not like the classics that made him famous. If I had to boil it down to one reason why, it would be because this novel isn't a legal thriller, its just a story of one man's journey from desperation to revenge to happiness. There aren't any bad guys, so there's never any fear of Malcom Bannister's plan not working.<br /><br />Malcom Bannister is a small time lawyer making a decent living supporting his wife and son. He agrees to broker a real estate deal for a Washington DC bigwig and soon gets swept up in a massive scandal. Malcom is sent to prison for money laundering. The minimum security prison gives Malcom the freedom to stay informed of life outside of jail, and he starts making plans for freedom. Finally, the time comes to execute his plan, and Malcom is given his freedom. Once on the outside, it looks like Malcom is just living day to day. But it soon becomes apparent that he has much bigger plans in mind.<br /><br />Grisham is a good writer, and this is a good novel, but there are problems. For instance, a little over halfway through the book, Grisham goes into a huge scheme launched by Malcom. He pretends to be a documentary filmmaker and goes after one person named Nathan Cooley. I had no idea who Cooley was, even though he'd spent time with Malcom in prison. Had I missed him earlier in the novel? This section goes on way to long before it comes clear what is happening. It's like a whole separate story.<br /><br />Another thing Grisham does that bothers me, and he's done it in a few novels before (I can't remember specifics). Malcom is thrown in jail and he has a wife and six year old child. The wife and child are kind of discarded as the novel goes on. I know as a parent, I would never just forget about my kids, regardless of circumstances.<br /><br />Grisham has earned all the respect and accolades he has received. But this novel tells a great story, but it isn't a thriller..

0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is an extraordinary book. I have no doubt that the book would hit home with painful sincerity for any terminally ill girls, but you don't have to fit these characteristics to love and cherish the story. You don't have to be female, have terminal cancer or be in love to relate to the characters in this novel; they were written with such personality and rich development that anyone could see themselves there, in the same situation, acting the same way. These characters aren't just stereotypes, used to represent an idea to further the plotline and the moral agenda of the author; they're real, rich characters- so much so that their impending loss carries with it the same weight as if you were losing a close friend. Don't think that means the book is a depressing traverse through tragedy, though. This is a book of hope, not despair; hope even when it seems like somebody has no reason for it. And for that, it's as beautiful as the stars- faulty though they may be.
B0040X46TE|5.0|CD is all I hoped for and more.  I work in welfare and support clients with complex needs, I have IZ cd playing in my work car and with his beautiful calming voice, IZ takes you on a journey.  One day while sitting outside a park, on the side of the road, with IZ playing on car cd I felt I was there with him in Hawai and the stress of the day no longer....truly fantastic...Many thanks

B008YZXYY2|4.0|I just got the CD today. I listened to it. I feel like it's a great CD. It reminds me of how good Stone Sour's last CD Audio Secrecy. House of Gold & Bones part 1 sounds just like the same old stone sour that people like. I can't wait for part 2 next year.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this CD was that I thought it felt short. The other three albums sounds seemed like they're were longer. I wonder if Stone sour is going to release a two CD set when part 2 comes out.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Super read!! Just as good as all the others. Can not wait for the next one!!!!! If you haven't started this series it's a must read!!
B000MV9026|5.0|Great movie for the entire family. The movie also was educational in that it showed that if you pull together, you can accomplish more than trying to be a hero. Sometimes you have to get help. I could have watched the whole movie even if it had been twice as long. I loved every minute of it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Much better than the first one ... and the first one was also excellent. The only problem is that I finished to soon and now I have to wait for the third one.
B005SH665S|5.0|Great movie for the entire family. I thought the shrimp like characters were very funny. The movie also was educational in that it showed that if you pull together, you can accomplish more than trying to be a hero. Sometimes you have to get help.
B005GY0Y8S|1.0|I grew up in Atlanta, Buckhead specifically, and spent many summers in France. I thought this would be a perfect book. However, the huge numbers of errors about Atlanta and France really spoiled it for me. And I wonder if anyone actually read this book before it was published....too many errors in the plot to count. I was very disappointed.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I wish I would have gotten this game a long time ago .I highly reccomend this to any one who likes rpg games. you should try it
B007OV9EYG|5.0|This is a beautiful movie! The story, the cast, the 3D, the CGI, it was all absolutely great. My children loved it, my wife and I loved it, it kept us entertained from the start all the way to the ending, well even after the ending cause it has 3 mini movies to watch, and the kids just couldn't stop talking about it and actually took it and watched it again for bed. The 3D did seem to darken the movie a bit, but it didn't take anything away from the movie. The kids were actually getting up off the couch to try to catch the stuff coming out of the screen. Recommend this to anyone and everyone.
0307473708|5.0|Very very good book. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the serial killer genre. It's a witty look inside the mind of a killer.
0553565915|3.0|Ok I thought this would be more informative but end up being more like a story about what happened to her. Still ok but was looking for a book more like Courageous souls

B000FCKGPC|5.0|There are quite a bit of negative reviews, but I am loving it more than the previous Storm of Swords. New characters are making this much more interesting.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Great backpack. I got this for my trip and wanted a easy way to store all my camera equipment. Comes with padded dividers that have velcro and can be rearranged. Has a lot of storage my bag at one point had all these things comfortably: nikon d90, 2 lenses, charger, 2 iPads, cables, ipad charger/cables.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|Loved this movie. If you liked any of his other films then you will like this one as well. Good ensemble, but the kids really are the stars of the show.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|I find myself switching to the browser version to get the detailed information summary of various products.  Maybe adding some tabbed extensions with more info would be helpful
B007THA4FI|2.0|After reading the sample, I elected not to buy the book because if I want to be depressed, I would watch the news.  It was very dark and even with a good imagination, I did not see it getting better.  PS- I did not expect a Harry Potter look-alike, so that was not the issue.
B0042P2VLU|5.0|My 2-year old daughter absolutely loves this movie. The story is told purely through music and despite zero dialogue, it holds her in rapt attention. It has saved us from a crabby toddler meltdown in public on more than one occasion. She has memorized the story so well that she can retell it while merely listening to music alone. This is a great respite from the usual trope that is geared towards children and it won't drive you insane even if they watch it over and over and over again. For the small price paid for digital copies, I bought this through Amazon and iTunes and it has been money well spent.
159514188X|1.0|I am a school counselor who was given 13 Reasons Why by Jay Asher by a colleague. I was disturbed by this book and would never recommend it for these reasons:<br />*poorly developed characters-superficial teens, clueless adults, not one was memorable<br />*unsympathetic main character-Hannah is just awful. Self involved, self pitying, self loathing and selfish<br />*format-the incessant switching between regular type and italics (Hannah's voice on the tape) was not just confusing...it was like being in a rowboat in very choppy water<br />*plot-laughable in parts (I kept thinking that Hannah had zero coping skills) and completely unbelievable (Hannah issuing orders re: the map and the tapes from the grave)<br />*a message that is so incredibly irresponsible that Mr. Asher and his publisher should reflect --it is NOT okay to in essence tell teens that one can teach any lessons by committing suicide. That is a complete and potentially devastating fantasy.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|this game ia great. when I got it I expected it to be just like temple run and though similar its also way different addicting and in my opinion better.... but a while after I got it I have problems opening the  part where u can upgrade the abilities and when I do it makes me leave the game.
B008OOYALE|1.0|Says working internet connection required. Tried both on wifi and mobile internet. Won't open either way. Uninstalled. T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S II.
B00785P2QC|4.0|nice gameplay.  I love the fact that we can build our own cityand manage it. I also like the part that it continues making money when you aren't there. I don't like the fact that the whole beginning you have to buy environment hostile buildings and only a couple environment friendly buildings. but overall it is an amazing game
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It grabbed me and held on tight. It only took two or three times sitting down for me to finish it. It was just a great book all around.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Ridley Scott's return to sci-fi was destined to be epic. However, it is not without controversy. Many people claimed the plot was confusing, or it lacked one, and that's to be expected from unintelligent movie goers. In fact, the reason I think so many people were baffled by the plot, or rather story, was because it wasn't a character driven plot but a concept driven one.<br /><br />This is a bold move for any film maker, but Ridley Scott's genius was able to pull it off.<br /><br />The concept this film wraps itself around is simply this: What are the origins of life on Earth? Where do we come from? Was it god? Or perhaps, aliens? There is a great line, edited out of the film but found on the special features, in which the lead scientist Charlie Holloway, played by Logan Marshall-Green, is asked what his scientific purpose is. He simply replies, \\"To find the origins of life and smash all man-made religions proving them wrong.\\"<br /><br />Needless to say, this is the focus of the plot, and the search for this answers is what drives the mission, the characters, and the story. The crew of the Prometheus find more than what they were looking for, and that makes the rest of this movie pleasantly surprising.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Good quality for a used item; arrived in a timely manner. As always, it is the funniest sit-com going. This was a used item but came in the original package. No defects and all cd's played. I use it on my MacBook with no problems.

B009AMAM9S|1.0|Mild Alert - Some general thematic spoilers to those who haven't seen the movie yet, but no specific plot spoilers.<br /><br />I and my wife saw this monstrosity in the theater yesterday. My wife liked it. I decided to sleep on it before writing this review to be as fair as possible and see if my negative feelings about it survived a good night's sleep.<br /><br />Until yesterday, the most disastrous mess of a movie I had ever seen was Heaven's Gate.  But I actually like Heaven's Gate because there are portions of it that approached and maybe even achieved movie greatness, and that at least mitigated the truly disastrous majority of that movie.  My dear wife's opposing opinion notwithstanding, I can see no such mitigation for Cloud Atlas. It is by far, in my opinion, the most presumptuous Hollywood mess of a disaster that I have ever seen.<br /><br />It is unintelligible from the very beginning, and you are well into it before realizing that it is a time-jumping morass. It just does not work as a movie. Granted, I saw on the ending credits that the movie is based on a book. I am perfectly willing to believe that it works as a novel. In fact, I am seriously considering reading the book now to satisfy my curiosity of how faithful the movie version is to the book.  But not having read the book, here is a compendium of what I was thinking as I sat through this utterly mind numbing event, fidgeting through the long minutes while waiting for it to mercifully end (apologies to other reviewers who obviously have a very different opinion, judging by the early 4 and 5 star reviews here):<br /><br />* \\"This monstrosity is unintelligible. Must be another Hollywood example of: `different' = `creative'. Look at how `brilliant' the director is!\\" - As I've already mentioned, unless you arrive knowing the basic premise of the story/plot, the first parts of the movie are utterly unintelligible. Speaking of the word \\"plot\\", there is none really, although I realized by the end of the movie that there is a \\"story\\" of sorts.<br /><br />* \\"Typical Hollywood liberalism on display.\\"-  The first love scene is of a gay couple and, by the time Cloud Atlas ends, the uber-enemy of all mankind is revealed to be Big Oil (by name!) and other profit-making corporations. And, of course, there are ample references to the rising sea levels, no doubt caused by global warming, which, in a giant loop of logic, is no doubt caused by the aforementioned Big Oil. Oh yes. To be fair, I don't know yet if the typical liberal propaganda is original to the book or if it was gratuitously inserted by Hollywood. If it's from the book, then it is certainly no fault of this movie's creators.<br /><br />* \\"Cartoonish. Yet one more example of Hollywood's over-reliance on CGI to hype interest when plot is weak or non-existent.\\" - I was thinking this especially during the parts that take place in Korea or Japan (not exactly sure which country the \\"fabricants\\" portions take place in). For me, the CGI car chases and shootouts were not only badly done, but were also particularly jarring in view of the fact that most of the rest of the movie takes place in the \\"real\\" world. The juxtaposition of cartoon and reality just didn't work for me. Sorry! (If I may be facetious for a moment, movies like \\"Who Killed Roger Rabbit\\" did that kind of thing much more successfully. ;-))<br /><br />* \\"There is no rhyme, reason or logic to the jumbled sequence of vignettes that this movie consists of.\\" - One normally expects that the order of scenes in a play, movie or novel is intentional and designed to clarify a story for the audience or move a story forward. Except for the opening and closing scenes with Tom Hanks as the movie's \\"narrator\\" for want of a better word, the entire rest of the movie's scenes could have been in any random order (and indeed, are). Even in retrospect, I see no overall logic for the movie's sequence of events or scenes.<br /><br />* \\"This movie's major themes have been done often and have ALWAYS been done better.\\" - Two majorly MAJOR themes of the movie are 1) every event and everyone are connected, ripples in time, that sort of thing and 2) Love transcends time through reincarnations. Each theme is so OVERLY done and so shoved down the audience's throat that it loses all effectiveness as a new \\"angle\\" or new way to look at it. My take, when a director or screenwriter has to make his/her point with a sledgehammer, it's as good as an admission that the storyline is weak.<br /><br />* \\"The whole ultimate point of this movie seems to be a lot of New Age platitudes and tripe.\\" - I'll leave it at that. This thought came to me towards the end of the movie and, depending on your personal belief system, that may be a plus or a minus for you.<br /><br />* Finally, \\"The bottom line message of this movie is an optimistic one, so I certainly wouldn't object to anyone of R-rated age seeing it. But neither would I recommend that they subject themselves to the torture.\\"<br /><br />Well, that's my take and, at least as of this date, I seem to be in the minority here. I will, however mention that we saw Cloud Atlas in a large Imax theater on a Saturday. I expected a full house, but we walked in 15 minutes before showtime to an almost empty theater! There were two people seated when we walked in, and by the time the movie started only a handful of others had joined the four of us. Cloud Atlas has been out for about a week. If this is indicative of its box office going into its second week, I am wondering if the \\"real world\\" is staying away from this \\"stinker\\" notwithstanding the 4-5 star reviews posted here.  Full disclosure, we went to an afternoon screening. Maybe the evening showings were better attended. Still...Imax...Saturday matinee...first run movie with science fiction and video game elements usually attractive to a male teen audience  - I wouldn't normally expect an empty theater under those circumstances. I don't know how much the studio spent on this clunker (judging from the A-list cast and significant CGI investment it probably wasn't cheap to make), but I think they may lose money on the deal. Having begun with Heaven's Gate, let me close the circle - I have read that Heaven's Gate bombed so badly it bankrupted its studio. Might Cloud Atlas similarly shake the foundations of its backers?
B000HAB4KS|5.0|I think that this might be the best film portrayal of existentialism. Whether you want to watch a film that gives you a primer on existential philosophy or you love existential film then this is the movie for you. It was pretty much life-changing for me. Never mind Jean Paul Sartre. As Neo (Keanu Reeves) is introduced to existentialism and begins to grasp its power, the viewer is brought along for the ride. His and our reactions are one in the same. The directors use Neo as a surrogate for the viewer, our reaction and his are identical and summed up in his powerful use of \\"...whoa\\" at multiple points.<br /><br />Carrie Anne Moss brings great depth to her character and her acting is positively superb. The range of emotion which she displays is absolutely phenomena. I'm really not sure why she didn't win any awards for her portrayal of Trinity. She definitely deserved it. The Oscars are just one big popularity contest and are in thrall to the politics of the Hollywood establishment. They just couldn't handle the questioning of authority which forms the basis of this film. The real issue is that they didn't dig deeper, it wasn't a film saying \\"screw the system\\" it was a film that challenges the viewer to question the reality (unreality) of the world around them.<br /><br />Overall an amazing movie. A must for people just getting into existentialism and a treat for people who are already having existential crises. And if you aren't having an existential crisis, this film will bring you to the point of unbridled terror that everything you have ever known is a lie.
B009DJB9HC|5.0|It only took two albums, but Afterglow finally shows BCC delivering a stellar album!  There are a lot of songs to like on the first couple of albums such as Black Country, Medusa, Save Me, Crossfire, and Song Of Yesterday, but Afterglow really shows the band hitting their stride.  Joe Bonamassa sounds really relaxed and loosened up and his playing is more rock than blues which is a good thing!  On the first two BCC albums, he sounded standoffish to rocking which I think held the band back making Jason Bonham, Glenn Hughes and Derek Sherinian work a lot harder at reminding the listeners that BBC is as much a hard rock band as it is a blues based rock band.  But Afterglow also shows the band taking more musical chances which has improved the songwriting a great deal.  The album reminds me of what Led Zeppelin was doing with Physical Graffiti and what Deep Purple was doing with Stormbringer and Come Taste The Band back in the mid 1970s.  I have listened to Afterglow quite a few times and I am about to start listening to it again.  Glenn Hughes has never sounded better and Jason Bonham has done his dad proud. Derek Sherinian is definitely carrying the torch started by the late Jon Lord and everyone is starting to gell.  I have read about the drama in the BCC camp recently and I hope that it all can be ironed out so that this band can be around for another 4 or 5 albums.  It is hard to pick a favorite song on the disc because each track is a killer!  There are a long list of classic rock artists who are currently making the best music of their careers, and Afterglow is an album worthy of that list.  Pick it up today!
0316228532|2.0|Does realistic equal bleak? Sometimes when reading this book I felt Rowling has something in common with her character Stuart Wall whose \\"slumming it\\" by seeking out \\"authentic\\" experiences-- such as unprotected sex with a junkie's daughter--is a reflection of his search for \\"true authenticity\\" - \\"this, he knew, was real life.\\" Rowling's determination to write about real life and move beyond her roots in fantasy makes me think of a child who consciously makes herself  the polar opposite of her parents and is therefore still under their influence. Sometimes Rowling's story seems to exist only to connect the dots between every disturbing issue imaginable, and I do wonder how much firsthand experience she has with some of these issues.<br /><br />For instance, I may not know much about injecting heroin but I know a bit about SQL injection because I work as a web programmer, and from the descriptions of hacks used to access the council website to make defamatory posts about various characters, I got the vibe that the author was fuzzy on how hacking into a website would work, but had read a Wikipedia article about it.<br /><br /> \\"It did not take very long for her to retrieve a site that gave explicit instructions for the simplest form of SQL injection. Then she brought up the Parish Council website.  It took her five minutes to hack the site, and then only because she had transcribed the code wrong the first time.\\" Fair enough, this character is not meant to be highly computer literate, or indeed highly intelligent, so maybe she wouldn't have thought to copy paste the code, but the \\"simplest form of SQL injection\\" would be something like \\"'x' or -\\", so not many characters to get wrong, even if she is meant to be dyslexic. And then \\"to her astonishment, she discovered that whoever was administering the site had not removed the user details of The_Ghost_of_Barry_Fairbrother from the database, but merely deleted the post. It would be child's play, therefore, to post in thesame name.\\" Um, ok I guess if the SQL injection allowed her to login she would probably end up signed in as the first person in the user table, and maybe that's likely to be the admin user, who apparently has the ability to post as any other user in the database... maybe, but pretty advanced functionality for what is supposed to be a very unsophisticated website.<br /><br />It may seem like I am nit-picking for the sake of it, but the description of something I know about made me wonder how realistic the other stuff was, which made Rowling's efforts to confront her audience with a barrage of bleak issues feel a bit contrived to me. Rowling is a good writer, but hopefully she can outgrow her idea that bleak equals mature, which was evident in the Harry Potter series as well as this new book for adults.
B008OTTSX4|5.0|Re-machined is the perfect tribute to a hard rock album that turns 40 this year and it makes the perfect companion to the 40th Anniversary Immersion boxset that came out recently to boot! Although I wasn't crazy about the Flaming Lips version of Smoke on The Water, every other name band and artist turns in an exceptional and killer performance! I like both the Chickenfoot and Glenn Hughes/Steve Vai versions of Highway Star and I really can't decide which one is better. Michael Anthony's bass playing and vocal screams are jaw dropping and I like that Steve Vai paid tribute to Jon Lord by playing a harmonized, Brian May-like version of Lord's Made In Japan organ introduction. And Glenn Hughes is a vocal dynamo on the song as well as on Maybe I'm A Leo. Metallica's version of When A Blind Man Cries is a real treat while BLS sound amazing on Pictures Of Home and Zakk Wylde's vocals have never sounded better. It is a great listen from start to finish, and I have to say it again that it makes a great companion set to the 40th Anniversary Machine Head remaster set. Re-machined is a tribute album that delivers and you won't be disappointed!
B008KE3960|5.0|It is a fun game. Enjoyed playing it on my kindle fire. Especially since I have not played tower defence in a while.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Purchased this watch to wear at work and waited over a week to review. It has been everything I expected. I work outside and had been looking for a reasonably priced automatic, that could stand up in the field. It functions flawlessly and has stood up to over a week of bumps and bruises. I have posted pictures as it appears today. This was an awesome deal for under $70. If you are not familiar with automatics you may notice some of the concerns in other reviews. The one I have has remained accurate. It did arrive in original packaging with warranty card. Look foward to not having to replace batteries or remembering to wind. Best little Seiko I look forward to having a long time.
067144901X|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moYUU6SWCOLJCX]]This was my daughter's favorite book from 13 months onward.  It's amazing that such a short book can be so much fun, so the best way to demonstrate that is through video.  Our daughter shocked us by saying the animal sounds before we could when she was younger, and even now still loves it at 19 months.<br /><br />This is a must for any child, both of our children liked this better than the \\"That's not my _______\\" series, Goodnight Moon, or any other book they had.<br /><br />p.s. she's in her brother's messy room!
B0013FSXT6|3.0|I've never seen a Kubrick movie I didn't like, and never seen a Tom Cruise movie that I did.  So when this movie first came out I was conflicted about whether or not to see it, and ultimately chose not to. Even now, having watched it all these years later, I wonder why Kubrick enlisted Cruise and Kidman. There were dozens of actors who could have pulled it off far better than they did. Any Tom Cruise movie is a Tom Cruise vehicle. Why get someone like that if you're seeking a nuanced and probing exploration of some deep recesses of the id?<br /><br />For the first hour or so we get a duet of Cruise and Kidman presenting a cardboard portrayal of marital/sexual tension.  Then Cruise attends the party at the mansion and things begin to get interesting: very mysterious, very surreal.  These enigmatic and dreamlike scenes, as well as the subsequent unwinding of what went on, made the film worth watching.<br /><br />But at this point Cruise seemed so far out of his element that it seemed Krubrick wasn't making a movie about the psyche, he was making a comment on Hollywood, or at least on hard-core Hollywood stars.  Like I say, a Cruise movie is all about Cruise.  Kubrick seems to be saying that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in Tom Cruise's philosophy. I found it interesting that the character who sets Cruise's character straight about things is played by a film producer and director, Sydney Pollack, who tells him \\"you're way out of your depth with this thing\\". Apparently he agrees, and he and Kidman, at the end of the film, reconcile with each other, then the film abruptly ends; not exactly a happy ending, more like a resignation to their humdrum existence.<br /><br />I've watched other Kubrick films a half-dozen times or more, but I think just one viewing of this number is enough.
0446580848|2.0|I have now added Nelson DeMille to my list of authors for whom I will not BUY the book.  Nelson - you are on my Library Only list with others such as James Patterson.<br /><br />This book reminds me of DeMille's The Gate House, another book full of wisecracks and no real story.  This writer is going downhill fast.  His best works were the early John Corey novels.
034580404X|1.0|These were great books !!! very entertaining, cant wait for the movie to come out.... I need more Mr. Grey
6305079811|5.0|I went to see this film against my will... After \\"Star Wars\\" everything out of the studios seemed to jump on the sci-fi bandwagon. From the obvious and amateurish \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" and \\"Buck Rogers\\". \\"Close Encounters, (surprisingly amazing) \\"Superman\\", (which was also amazing) to the 1st \\"Star Trek: The Mpotion Picture\\", (which I can understand was pretty much meant to be, and decent)... I could go on with other movies but you get the idea. I hated going to this film, but when it started, it was so much fun. I got it immediately, the music, the over-the-top camp, the special effects were a lot of fun and still feel they are mostly pretty well done for the time. Never mind the ladies in this film from Dale Arden to the evil princess... Wow... Worth the purchase alone. And the costumes and sets are crazy good. I watched it again years later and felt that this is classic stuff now and a lot of fun to watch with other people, great dialogue, at times cheesy, but great cheesy. Also, Max Von Sydow's (SP?) portrayal of Ming is not only almost a genetically reproduced version of the Ming from not only the comics, but also the original B&W serials. And he still scares me a bit because of his just insane, sick, twisted evil. So much to watch here and don't forget the phenomenal soundtrack by \\"Queen\\". Also worth the purchase.
B00338QENI|5.0|I could not put this down. It is a fascinating and inspiring story that is also a cautionary tale about modern medical history. I recommend this to all . Although it is nonfiction and includes science info, the core of the book is the very human story of how this remarkable scientific achievement affected the lives of Henrietta's family.
B004V98UKS|1.0|Nothing interesting. Not worth the time or space. Very disappointed.  Eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|For those of us not so lucky to own a Kindle Fire.  This app also works very well with android systems too. I love the big buttons AND the % key.  I use it balance my checkbook and simple math. Can't speak for higher math problems, since lucky I don't have any of those. It works exactly like my old stand alone calculator and that is what I was looking for.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book has been a tremendous help to me in my quest for personal growth and finding freedom from life's torments.<br />The author clearly shows the reader how we as human beings mistreat others and ourselves.  But more importantly, he shows us how we can save ourselves from the pain and heartache we cause ourselves by continuing to live in the filth of bad thinking , allowing other peoples' poor treatment of us to affect us.<br /><br />This book can be used by anyone wishing to improve the quality of their life.  The principles in the book are simple to understand, yet so profound.  This book could easily be the basis for a course called \\"How to live with others and yourself\\".<br />A great read for anyone who desires to free themselves of the pain and misery life can deal us all.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is one of the best books I've read. It was touching and really meant something to me. I am absolutely going to read it again. Buy it!!!:)

B001GCUNYO|4.0|I saw a preview of \\"Taken\\" on a movie I had previously purchased from Amazon...in fact I am a regular customer of Amazon for movies and Kindle books.<br />The preview looked good and I decided to order the movie, even though a friend thought I wouldn't like it.<br />It was an action-packed story, well acted, and despite the heavy action throughout, it still found time to touch on relationships and the human desire to be part of a meaningful relationship.  It showed that the true meaning of love will motivate endeavour and sacrifice.<br />When I saw that \\"Taken 2\\" was in the pipeline, I signed up to be notified when it became available.....but then, I have found that Liam Neeson is a wonderful actor and brings something special to his roles.
0062127241|5.0|I highly recommend Pete Townshend's new book Who I Am. It took him over 16 years to write it and he was meticulous with his detail and emotion throughout.<br /><br />What we need now is Roger Daltrey's book.
B006HGXGWU|4.0|As a drama, this movie was very compelling and highlights the difficulties that people and their families go through at the onset of mental disease. But at the heart of the matter, are Curtis' experiences real or are they the product of a mind that is slowly betraying him. While many may have issues with the ending, the movie does its job in highlighting those difficulties and the struggle to determine what is real and what is not. The twist at the end reveals what is real and make you question whether he was crazy or not.
B00448VST6|5.0|If you're a game geek or you love the comics then this is the movie you've always dreamed of ... with sub-space highways and all that. Their world is basically what we've always wished for with virtual weapons, defying gravity and pee bars. The plot is spot on with the comic books and the actors were will selected. I definitely enjoyed the virtual, game like action in this film and the humor is hilarious. All in all this is one of my favorite movies of all time.

B004VMUS9G|2.0|This used to be my primary alarm clock. I had an alarm that would go off, allow me 5 snoozes each one shorter by a minute for a total of 15 min snooze, then I would have to solve two math problems. The app even let me pick an mp3 from my device as my alarm tone, which is pretty awesome. But since the last update it hasn't been working right. I use this thing to get me up for college and work. One day it went off, I hit snooze, and I didn't hear anything more from it until two hours later. The alarm stopped going off because another application issued a pop-up reminder, so extreme alarm clock waited its turn. My alarm should have the highest priority, and it used to. I have since deleted this app from my phone. Even if the issue gets resolved I would not feel comfortable relying on this.

B009XY97VC|5.0|Before I start, please understand: SkyWorld is not Archangel; SkyWorld is not Invincible; SkyWorld is not Illusions.<br />SkyWorld is an entirely new album from Two Steps from Hell.  It has different feel.  Archangel was angelic and very choral; Invincible was darker, heavier, and had a \\"warrior\\" feel to it.  SkyWorld is an aggregate of  different sounds--some worked, some didn't.  Yes, the first track contains dubstep; listen to it for a few times, though, before you make your judgement.  El Dorado is absolutely amazing, as is SkyWorld, Big Sky, Sun & Moon (my favorite in this album, reminiscent of Illusions), For the Win, Winterspell, Ocean Kingdom, and Blackheart.  There are violins, Eastern-sounding wailing, electronic elements,and the classical strings and choirs; and yes, there are two songs with English lyrics.  Back to Earth is the only TSFH song that I actually find atrocious.  SkyWorld is less of a journey than TSFH's other albums, and I don't really like the sequence of the tracks.  However, this album still gets five stars because it is lightyears ahead of other trailer music albums.  SkyWorld crumples Trailerhead into a little tin-foil ball and throws it in the trash bin.  TSFH still has original melodies, a great value (utterly fantastic value!), and most importantly, the composers' rich emotion is present in every track.<br />I recommend you buy this album immediately.  You will not be disappointed.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I was super excited to see a cord at this price, so I decided I'd take the plunge and pay. I even went so far as to pay for 2nd day shipping. It's been over a week and I still have yet to receive it. I'm really irritated that its not here.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|I have played this game a few times at friends before I actually bought it for us. This game is a great game for all ages. We played it with a 6 and a 9 year old and even the 6 year old had lots of fun (played with an adult in a team). I can highly recommend it to anybody who likes strategic board games. This one is easy to understand and to play. No complicated strategic rules, but good enough to keep you entertained for hours and hours.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I like this game. I agree it should have more coins to posy with. It should have more opportunity to collect prides. There's not much opportunity for strategy.
B008PWUWLC|4.0|This Timbuk2 Gripster case is very comfortable to use. It fits the Kindle Fire perfectly and the Kindle can't slip out. The jacket protects it all around, while still leaving openings for the speakers, the cable earphone jacks, and the on button. It isn't overly padded, so it might not be the best protection you could have for a dropped Kindle. On the other hand, I haven't ever dropped my Kindle (yet), so I am less concerned with that than with the feel of the cover while I am reading. I like the cloth covered Gripster, and it is lighter in weight than my old plastic leather-like cover, also a plus. The \\"gripster\\" part of the cover is a rubber strip on the edges so that when you prop up the cover to watch a video (only in landscape mode), the cover stays where it is without slipping. And you can adjust it to any angle, unlike with the stands that only allow one or two angles.<br /><br />So far I like the TimBuk2 jacket better than my plastic jacket, but if it gets smudged I suspect it will not be as easy to clean as the plastic cover. I would expect to pay around twenty dollars for this jacket, not sure I would find it a good value at the current price of thirty-five.
B00884GR0W|3.0|good app but it keeps going back to my home screen. it won't let me play for over a few minutes. and it doesn't save my progress either.

1429252553|2.0|I know this review will be filed under the listing for the solutions manual, but I'm writing about both the text and the manual and, quite frankly, they share parallel flaws and errors.  So here goes...<br /><br />If there's anything enjoyable about Shriver and Atkins' \\"Inorganic Chemistry\\" (5th ed), it's the presentation.  Nice organization of material with broad scope and colorful figures.  The book itself is relatively lightweight too.  It certainly doesn't seem as though this text is a typical undergraduate chemistry book.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's a statement that applies as much to this book's flaws as it does its (few) strengths.  Atkins' explanations are terse and lean, and his definitions of terms lack the clarity that a first-time student of inorganic chemistry - like myself - so often desperately needs.  Examples are plentiful, but their 'solutions' vary between superfluous (and poorly - or even arrogantly - worded) and insufficient, and most end-of-chapter exercises and problems are either unclear in their desired solutions or only tangentially related to the 'skills' (whatever they're supposed to be - the text does very little to build up problem solving skills) presented in each chapter.<br /><br />Which also brings me to the solutions manual, where one unfortunately finds even more flaws: not just lean explanations, but also plenty of errors and mistaken assumptions that could easily have been resolved had the manual's authors bothered to re-read what they wrote one more time.  (For a glaring example, find a copy - don't buy one if you don't have to! - and consult the solution for Exercise 1.2.  (The good news: the book's website has a free PDF of solutions to the self-tests and exercises.)  Don't panic if you somehow find your arithmetic disagreeing with the authors'; it really should be 102.)  I'm starting to suspect that Shriver and/or Atkins deleted whatever this other team had to offer and wrote in the solutions themselves.<br /><br />Unlike many of the other reviewers who have posted their opinions here, I can't offer any alternative texts for Shriver and Atkins' version.  But if you're looking to learn from a good text, look elsewhere.ke many of the other reviewers who have posted their opinions here, I can't offer any alternative texts for Shriver and Atkins' version.

B0098VYCCE|2.0|What was meant to be epic misses it's mark shamefully.  Kristin Stewart as Snow White?  Really?  Wasn't she bad enough in the twilite movie?  Charlize Theron thinks that screaming her way through every scene captures the essence of the evil queen.  It's rumored that soon all actors will be computer generated as opposed to human.  Who would possibly know the difference?  Thank God celluoid has protected the magic and talent (and yes, beauty) of Hollywood at it's peak:  Greta Garbo, Cary Grant, Rita Hayworth, Gene Kelly, well.... you get the idea.

B005KR6OBM|3.0|This is great for the price of the 4 seasons, but sometimes you have to use the skip back button for the audio to kick in and start with the video. Also none of the audio works in the extras, but you can find all of those on the internet. So again, it's a great price for what you pay for!
B007UXSPK2|3.0|This was an 'okay' movie...nothing special about it.  The so-called 'Special Effects' weren't even that special.  Climbing (and almost slipping) while hanging from the outside of a tall building...so overdone. Watching Tom Cruise do it, didn't make it any better...no matter how tall the building was supposed to be.<br /><br />The characters were boring and the storyline contrived. I actually found myself rooting for the far more interesting Bad Girl. The ending was oh-so predictable. Again, nothing special here.<br /><br />So, if you have nothing better to do and have some time to kill...go ahead, watch this movie. Just don't expect anything special.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|This movie left me with a lot of questions, but all in all it was a great movie. Definitely need a hard copy.
0525953728|5.0|Well written and informative. This first hand account of what happened and how the operation went down provides  revealing insight about the Navy Seals.
B0068THAGY|2.0|The first hour of the movie is incredibly boring.<br /><br />This movie had elements of ET and the Goonies...<br />Why ET? because of the alien creature trying to return to his HOME. Why the Goonies? because of the kid bunch and the teen attraction between two characters.<br /><br />The entire movie is \\"in the dark\\". You cant see anything.<br /><br />(In-movie weirdness)<br />When the town is overrun by the military: Every tank and military officers are shouting everywhere. The shooting makes no sense at all. Its like they were shooting ghosts.<br /><br />Speilberg should lay off the 80s already. Shirts, old tv sets, radios.... boring. If the target market is KIDS then they should lay off old electronics.

0205313426|5.0|\\"Omit Needless Words! Omit Needless Words! Omit Needless Words!\\" {Introduction, XV] The New Yorker was right, \\"The book remains a nonpareil: direct, correct, and delightful.\\" In the Introduction, E.B. White relates an experience of being in Mr. Strunk's classroom. (see above)<br /><br />\\"Vigorous writing is concise.\\"<br /><br />This quote and exhortation - as seen in the book's inside flap - was well worth the price of the book. {Buy the book, and see the inside flap}.<br />:)<br /><br />I have noticed an improvement in my writing skills already. The story of how this book came to be republished and revised, coupled with Mr. White's impression of the author, makes an indelible impression on the reader, and sets the tone of the book as a whole.<br />...<br />Page 83 admits, \\"language is perpetually in flux: it is a living stream, shifting, changing... losing old forms in the backwaters of time.\\"<br /><br />So while \\"style\\" remains subjective and the \\"elements\\" are clearly explained throughout, this book remains a great start for those of us who wish to master the art of written communication.

B004V5A7K8|5.0|This is about as good of a Arkanoid knock off as you will ever find.  I miss playing the original at the laundromat next to my first job as a teenager.  this does a fine job of recreating on my phone.

B005LAIIDU|4.0|I've been planning on seeing \\"Wreck-It Ralph\\" since the first trailer came out featuring Talking Heads' \\"Once in a Lifetime.\\"  It was a clear message to Gen Xers that this was a movie for us.  The fact that it happened to be released shortly after my birthday made it a perfect opportunity to take my son to his first movie.  When we got there it was clear I wasn't the only one - there were several dads with their children in the theater.<br /><br />\\"Wreck-It Ralph\\" posits the question: does Donkey Kong like his job? When you make a living being a bad guy, does that make you a BAD guy? It's a timeworn plot that worked well for \\"The Incredibles\\" and \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" - the plight of modern men who are becoming increasingly dissatisfied with their lot in life.  In this case it's Ralph (John C. Reilly) who has a love/hate relationship with the people who live in the building he regularly wrecks and the hero who rebuilds it, Felix (Jack McBrayer).  Despondent over his unpopularity and low social status, Ralph decides to strive for a medal in another game with visions of returning home as a hero.<br /><br />That game is Hero's Duty, a cross between Call of Duty and Halo. It's there that Ralph gets mixed up with tough-but-vulnerable Calhoun (Jane Lynch).  Ralph only gradually begins to understand just how much he has unbalanced the natural order of the video game universe when he ends up contaminating a racing game called Sugar Rush.<br /><br />\\"Wreck-It Ralph\\" is a sly nod to the 80s heyday of coin-operated console video games, when characters had lovable quirks like speaking a nonsensical language (Q-bert), limited movement (Felix), or served beer as a form of entertainment (Tapper). At various points during the film, we see the action from a two-dimensional pixilated perspective.  This puts the film in the right frame - it's all just pixels for our entertainment, after all.<br /><br />\\"Wreck-It Ralph\\" is not without its flaws.  There's a tedious romance between Felix and Calhoun, complete with flashbacks, that could have easily been excised.  The majority of the movie actually focuses on the hyper-adorable Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) in Sugar Rush, a setting which is more Candy Kingdom (from Adventure Time) than a video game -- adults looking for a heady whirl through other gamescapes will be disappointed.  Mostly, it's just too long, and all the kids in the audience got fidgety whenever there was too much dialogue.<br /><br />The moral of the story seems to be that the job market is tough, your role is more important than you think, and you're better off being appreciated in your old job than going for glory in your new one.  Or maybe I'm simply reading too much into it.  My son thought the movie was \\"okay,\\" but then he's never played Pac-Man or Donkey Kong.Calhoun, complete with flashbacks, that could have easily been excised.
