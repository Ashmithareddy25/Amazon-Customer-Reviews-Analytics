B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I've been a fan of Downton Abbey since the beginning.  I'll rewatch the entire series before the next season starts!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This was introduced to us by a friend and as I said in the heading, I'm hooked!  That has not happened with any series that I can remember.  I especially appreciate that every character has a &#34;leading&#34; part!
B004RZGUBM|5.0|I love these classic stories.  They all still have good lessons for current day morals.  You can't beat the price to own these classics.
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|Thanks Fox, for taking another good show, shuffling it around, and cancelling it after its stint in ratings purgatory (Firefly and Titus also come to mind).
B004WCTLNY|5.0|I saw the movie in the theater and liked it so I bought it. I don't my movies very often.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Serious topic but there was enough humor to keep it entertaining.  I would recomend this move to anyone that was alive to remember this and interested in the history of America's dealings with the middle east.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This movie was done well. I rearly buy movies. This one was really worth it. The are and story were good. A must have movie.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I've read every book by Vindy Flynn, twice. I'm addicted. The Last Man was by far the best book in the series. Grabs you from the first page. Brings you up to speed on Nash and Hurley. Exands on Kennedy's complexities, and introduces dramatic conflict for Rapp. Fantastic.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is a good source of fun for the whole family. You can even challenge your friends to beat your high score on your favorite mini game. My younger brother and I really enjoy helping each other out and even creating sibling challenges once in a while. It's awesome
B0066W1AZK|1.0|I THOUGHT I COULD TEACH MY CHILD CHESS THROUGH THIS APP BUT IWAS MISTAKEN. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR A BEGINNER CHILD
B00992CF6W|1.0|i found it too hard to control with touch screen, more practical with a mouse and keyboard or possibly a controller.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I use this app all of the time. Wonderful to have and I recommend it. I use it every day
0740785508|5.0|It's an amazing book. It basically shows you how to realize the ideas in your mind and bring them to life on your canvas or whatever your medium is. This is not a book about how to paint certain stuff. It is about shortcuts and ways to make maquettes and other stuff to help your ideas. Overall it's a great book.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|For years Ive waited for a Scottish princess. That day has arrived. And how spectacular she is. Brave beautiful and strong. Loved it
0740797719|5.0|Simply amazing. A really helpful and teaching book. Leveled me up so much in the field of color and light and how to use them in my art.
0525952926|5.0|Ken Foolery once again produces a fabulous read. I cant wait for the final installment pf this fabulous trilogy. I highly recommend reading this trilogy in order
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I HATE that you put Accu Weather on my Samsung TV and my Kindle!  It doesn't give you the opportunity to put in a zip code so you only get the cities they want you to choose.<br /><br />THE WEATHER CHANNEL ALLOWS THAT AND IS MUCH BETTER!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Outstanding.<br />An insightful  description of the despicable nature of man and at the same time his ability to rise up and embrace love and  forgiveness and move forward with trust honor compassion and  a new life
B0063IH60K|5.0|i love to play solitaire on my computer but not on my kindle, it doesn't give you the same opportunities!!<br /><br />this is NOT THE ORIGINAL SOLITAIRE WINDOWS OFFERS, WHY CAN'T YOU PLAY A NORMAL GAME?
B007VYDFMS|5.0|...you have ot see it, enough said!  It's for everyone.  You don't need to be a Marley fan, but you might become one!  Only thing dissappointing is my sister told me the &#34;extras&#34; were a must see.  Amazon promised, but did not deliver. 7:(
B005COO1X6|5.0|Loved it. Couldn't put it down. Short and sweet. Interesting and flowed well. Left me wanting more! Love Stephen king
B006LSZECO|4.0|Could not put the book down but .......With ALL this woman did to her husband....did not like the ending.  The man needs a shrink!!!!!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|this game is completely like Mario Bros.!!! I like it though. oh, and fyi to all those people who are old and said &quot;it reminds of how fun it was to play Mario Bros.!&quot; THEY STILL MAKE X-BOXES AND WIIS THAT YOU CAN PLAY MARIO BROTHERS ON!! no offense
B0060YIBLK|1.0|Egotistical, republican and someone needs to count the times he uses the word I, and see who this book is about
B0094WK9GU|5.0|cant stop moving. love driving to it, running, working out, peeling wallpaper, house work, work work. all the songs are put together with style and skill. you want a great dance anthem album? buy this!
B002NXQ0X8|5.0|Pretty impressed with the collaborative effort; lots of good tracks and you can tell that there is a chemistry between the artists that translates to their music.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|This movie was awful.  It redirects peoples attention away from the fact that a commercial airline pilot is a raging alcoholic and drug addict towards the \\"heroic\\" act of minimizing a crash with outstanding skill.  People with drug/alcohol probs do this everyday...come up with excuses and so do their enablers.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|Read and listen to how Ms. Gilbert describes a New year's Eve at an ashram in India:<br /><br />As the minutes pass, it feels to me like we are collectively pulling the year 2004 toward us. Like we have roped it with our music, and now we are hauling it across the night sky like it's a massive fishing net, brimming with all our unknown destinies. And what a heavy net it is, indeed, carrying as it does all the births, deaths, tragedies, wars, love stories, inventions, transformations, and calamities that are destined for all of us this coming year. We keep singing and we keep hauling, hand-over-hand, minute-by-minute, voice after voice, closer and closer. The seconds drop down to midnight and we sing with our biggest effort yet and in this last brave exertion we finally pull the net of New Year over us, covering both the sky and ourselves with it. God only knows what the year might contain, but now it is here, and we are all beneath it.<br /><br />That’s not the best paragraph in the book—I just pulled it out at random. Almost every sentence in the book is a gold mine of word painting. I read the first three chapters of that book and was reduced to tears in my neighborhood Starbucks. I wanted to give up writing. Why bother? Everything I could possibly say about life’s struggles or self-discovery has already been said in this book, and said so much better than I could possibly think of even attempting. Ms. Gilbert paints with words like Caravaggio painted with oils and colors. I feel her feelings. I see the streets of Italy and the cow paths of India that she traverses. I taste her gelato in Rome and pizza in Sicily. I feel her frustrations and pain to the depths of my soul as she goes through divorce and then loses the love of her life on top of that. I weep with her and I celebrate her accomplishments and just marvel at page after page because she writes so damned well. Ms. Gilbert doesn't just write well, she invites me into her life, she bares her soul, andI cry and laugh and rejoice with her.<br /><br />Read this book to inspire yourself, to console yourself, or just to enjoy the prose as poetry as you might enjoy a chocolate mousse or a fine wine or the best pizza you've ever eaten. I bet you can't read it just once. And then you'll buy copies for people you love because you want them to experience what you have through reading &#34;Eat Pray Love.&#34;
B00003JRCQ|5.0|As a fan of Jane Austen's writings, it was great to see her work unfold on camera. Putting faces with the characters in the book was genius!
B007XF4J70|5.0|Elsa: Was that cannon fire or is it my heart pounding?<br /><br />Neither, Elsa, it was - my heart pounding.<br /><br />What an absolutely gorgeous print of Casablanca (1943) this Blu-ray is.  What a treasure.  You will not regret purchasing this Blu-ray.<br /><br />Bonus:  After the film ends the Warning Label pops up (and it's not just in English).  After about 20 Warning Labels all in different languages - I could not take it anymore - and opened the disc tray just to make it stop.  LOL
B00846F1YW|2.0|why hide objects under banners?  I don't get the purpose. The graphics are too large for the format and the puzzles are too repetitive. Storyline is silly.
B00571F26Y|5.0|My wife and I have been modifying our eating for the past year.  During this time I have read numerous books on food and diet.  My focus has mostly been on paleo style eating plans.  Wheat Belly simply fills in many of the gaps in my education.<br /><br />Having grown up in the 60's and 70's with a father who sold cookies for Nabisco I have most likely consumed more wheat and sugar than the average American.  Now that I am working on eliminating wheat from my diet I am feeling better than I have ever felt before.  Wheat Belly was the perfect book to help me stop eating wheat.  The information provided in the book makes such a compelling case for wheat being a HUGE reason for so many of the problems that our nation and for that matter the worlds population is currently facing that I fully expect in the next decade that wheat products will be labeled like cigarettes.  Remember it was less than 50 years ago that cigarettes were being advertised as good for you.<br /><br />Dr. Davis has a way with his writing that is both informative and entertaining. The book covers technical details in a manner that is both detailed and enjoyable to read.<br /><br />If you are even the least bit curious or concerned about you health you need to add Wheat Belly to your reading list.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I chose this rating because I love the series and the disc was in perfect condition!  One of my favorite shows!
B00499QUK2|5.0|This is a great series. Benedict Cumberbatch as Holmes is entertaining as the know-it-all detective. Martin Freeman as Dr. Watson plays off of Benedict well. They are a great team. Dr. Watson isn't written as a bumbling sidekick as he has been portrayed in some movies. They are equals in their own way.
B004132HZS|5.0|Season one is the best kick off to one of the best shows out there!! I can't wait until season 3!
B0093WVND4|5.0|I really thought the book was great. The movie is also great. I would suggest young and old read and watch.
B009FRG8IW|5.0|I have never been inclined to buy house music, much less listen to it on the radio. However, I am so pleased I bought this album. It has become my favorite by far of all the music I own, which is mostly alternative and indy rock.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Gone Girl did more than disappoint me, it disgusted me. The characterizations left me with a sick feeling of the depravity of human nature. At one point, I felt Amy would be brought to justice and yet that never happened. That she got pregnant and the book ended with Nick staying with her is a truly sad commentary on human nature and what motivates people. This book is terribly disturbing. I have read Flynn's other books and admired her style but she lost me as a fan with this book. It truly sickened me.
B002RKSZS0|4.0|I enjoyed the heroine. Didn't like it as well as Jane Austen's other novels. Things I LOVED about it but things I disliked as well. Disliked Austen's rants in some parts where it feels like her opinion just jumps off the pages. Loved the heroines ignorance in stepping out into the world and how she doesn't allow it to harden her spirit. Such is life we live in. Good read.
B003G4W49C|5.0|After reading the Hunger games  I needed something else to read. For everyone out there that is looking for another series to read, choose this one. I could not put it down.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|this stylus works great it glides across the glass very well, many of these styluses drag across the screen and as such they are prone to making errors as the sensitivity for devices is high. it feels just like a normal pen in the hand when making movements.<br />It also has three different sizes one large one attached to the cap, and two on the actual rod, one on both ends. The smallest one is great for precision which is hard to find for styluses and will make using paint or drawing something much easier. The medium one is for normal tasks, the large one has some drawing uses or if you don't need to be precise but need something larger for your application.<br /><br />its a bit more expensive than some styluses though that is because you are paying for two extra rubber points. so your getting three in one here. which makes it about as expensive as three cheaper styluses and your getting better quality.
B003K16P3M|5.0|Amazing book, that I read way to fast haha I would recommend this book to anyone and can't wait to read bitter blue & the fire
B00936A0RU|5.0|Love cast and story and the fact it was based somewhat on the truth.  Couldn't have done a better job!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app sucks. I can't even get a news feed page. It just says &quot;There was an error loading newsfeed.&quot; Don't even waste your time with this stupid app.
B002ZG999U|5.0|How can you go wrong with this cast?!  Need i say more ... action, comedy, etc  LOVED it!! This movie had it all.
B0083ZRAJS|1.0|It was amazing!! It had so many details. I love how you could imagine everything. Dorothy was my favorite character.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|Product would not download even though a reviewer reported that it did download to their kindl fire.  to be fair i cannot review something that i have not tried. It was very frustrating and time consuming trying to get it to download.
0143039482|4.0|Somewhat dreary, sad, and then the twists began.  I enjoyed the story, but don't think all of my friends would love it.  It is also not a book you want to read when you are looking for a light, airy book.  Probably Steinbeck at his best.  It was well constructed and held my interest.
B0067R0APK|5.0|I am not computer savvy. I don't have a twelve-year-old boy or girl at my house to make things work.  AccuWeather App is easy to use! This is so easy for me to use. I had the free edition but liked it so much I got the Platinum one.  Now I am wondering if I can delete the old one and keep this one.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Fabulous, very twisty novel with a very twisted main character! Couldn't put it down and it has stayed with me since.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like this ease to use weather report.  The only problem I have is that it won't show in landscape.  I tried AccuWeather platinum edition to see if it is as good and to get rid of the adds.  The one that costs money  has a gross Icon with the word Sale across its front.  It was so ugly that I deleted the one I paid for and kept the free one with the ads.  It is more accurate to my area's weather than the Weather Channel on cable.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|An excellent drama about the issue of substance abuse & addiction - both drugs and alcohol.  There was unnecessary nudity and foul language, so be careful to view this movie with individuals who are at least 18 or older.  Regardless, it was a very good drama.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Glee is one of those shows that shouldn't have worked. Another high school dramedy filled with stereotypical characters. And singing, for God sakes. SINGING. Sure, a lot of people like American Idol, but do they really want to see a bunch of fairly no-name actors (although some veteran Broadway stars) belt out show tunes?  Read more at[...]
B005OT2YVA|4.0|SImilar to the other Transformer Movies, this was very well done from the stroy line to the special effects. Definitely worth the time!
B0009ZHJ7S|1.0|I was under the impression the DVD was new, when it arrived I was disappointed to see a used DVD in poor condition, I didn't complain because of the price. Just like the old saying you get what you pay for.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Nice chance to get this movie.  I thought it was great in the movie theatres, such adventure and action-packed.  Had to buy the movie for my collection.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is a must read! It starts off a bit slow, but is well worth it. You find yourself on an emotional rollercoaster with Sky and Holder. I couldn't put the book down and never wanted it to end.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book wasn't what i thought it was going to be about, but it had me hooked.. Great  book, specially for a teen audience
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE IT HAD ME IN THE MOVIE LIKE IF I WAS THERE, I'm for pros! WILL SEE IT AGAIN.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a good read. I think of it as a weird futuristic view of the book \\"Night\\", with a love story that is in almost every teen book. I refuse to read the rest of the trilogy because I am sure it will come to a sad ending due to her over-attachment to characters and by the way it reads...like it is setting you up for a dramatic fall, or in this case a good cry. However, this book is very good, and humbling.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|THIS IS OKAY IT A LITTLE HARD FOR LITTLE PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF FIVE OR MAYBE  YOUNGER IT'S TOO FAST.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|it was great before they redid it but then it turned into a little kid game I wish they had kept it at what It was before. great for outlet kids but if your looking for something to pass the time not as great.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I DIDN'T DOWN LODE IT,THE GAME WOULDN'T COME ON SO I CAN NOT GAVE ANY FACTS ABOUT IT SO SORRY
B002PYW26O|4.0|Humor with romance, attitude, drama, action, and a thriller with those spiders. And a Scifi makes this movie great. The only thing that made me pause and not give a five star was that animated monkey alien. Really - why. I'm still waiting for the next Lost in Space saga. Wazzup with that.
B003IY48PS|5.0|This is the very first horror movie I ever saw when I was young that is when it came out and you had to rent vhs players cause they were too expensive to buy and we rented this movie with it. I remember being so scared and I loved it then and I love it now!!
1616550414|5.0|When it first arrived, the quality and the weigh surprised me, the book is HEAVY the paper is thick and almost every page is in colors. It has artwork from every single Zelda ever made and it really showcases the evolution of the franchise, even if you don't like that whole timeline-s*** this book is awesome!!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a truely great book every American should read to understand what our military faces daily in the modern battle field with everything stacked in the foes favor according to our limits as to when we can engage a combatant.<br />Cris gives credit to all the services and shows that even though the SEALS are better trained they do not look at themselves as better than the troops they work with.  They feel they are their to protect their brothers in arms.<br />The book shows the human side of a SEALS life by the accounts included by his wife of what the family life is like of a frequently deployed warrior.<br />He even says the greatest sniper was a Marine named Hancock in Viet Nam with 93 kills because of he had more difficult kills.  Cris said he was lucky as he was in a target rich environment.<br />If your not into military battles this book is not for you.
B000I2JI80|4.0|Fujufilm Pro 400H has very natural color and is suitable for all kind of shooting condition. Even though it's rated as ISO 400, it does not have any noticeable film grain. Over all a great all-around 120 film.
B00AESN8XY|2.0|I love this game j have it on my ipjone and found it.on my kindle and I have purchased it but it wont install<br />please fix
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|This is easily one of the best albums that will release this year and is already one of my favorites.
B008PNBU30|4.0|it came in an old paper case which was kind of dented but it was an unused cd!!!!  Its nice to know that some people can be honest about not using cds.
B004MPR80E|5.0|I did not pick this when it came out as I was not sure if I wanted to read 600 pages about a deadly disease. But later a friend suggested and I started reading. This is such nicely written by Mr. Mukherjee! Lots of interesting facts and feels almost like a biography.
030758836X|4.0|Dark and increasingly disturbing this book took me to a place I didn't see coming and that is rare.  I figured certain parts out long before they were revealed but the extent to which this book is twisted is a path I didn't even consider going down.  Is it a love story? A story of obsession? A story of betrayal? Or maybe its all of that rolled into one.  The beginning of the book is a little slow and it took me a while to get into the groove but then it picks up and swings you around and takes you on a wild ride that you didn't see coming.  This is psychological thriller at its best.  Its not graphically gory its just down right disturbing.  Did I love it or did I hate it? I still don't know I just know I will probably recommend it to others because I need someone else to talk to about it!
B004P4S4NM|5.0|How could you ever go wrong with Adele? Her voice is so rich and soulful, sounds we need more of! Love her to bits.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|Great music from Sinatra from a great old and gone hotel. This was in a day that Las Vegas was a place you could get a fine meal for $15 and see a show
B00BHMF578|2.0|Not very impressed.  Was disappointed in the continual use of the F bomb.  Does everyone in intelligent depts. etc use such language?  Would not recommend  this movie.  Puzzled how if got best picture?
0425252868|5.0|This was a fabulous book from cover to cover. It is a great story that was told in such a fashion that it all came together. The German fighter pilot's personal story was presented in such an excellent manner that one could understand his character and personality. It was impressively done. In the same fashion, the American pilot's  character is revealed and one could understand his background, training, family relationships, and professional conduct. Both had stories that in themselves would have been interesting books. When the two stories came together due to the fateful encounter during the war, the stories became even more remarkable. The book had a happy ending as they were able to finally meet and continue their lives as friends. I would have enjoyed being present at one of the speaking engagement that they jointly pursued just to hear more of the personal stories. The author, reportedly had been researching and developing this book over a period of 8 years. It was time well spent as the product of his work was worthy of special praise and merit. I hope that you enjoy this story as much as I did !
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun game find myself playing over and over. I like that it will finish the game for you once you get all the correct moves.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game to pass the time.  Gets very addictive when trying to beat best time and score.  Very easy way to lose track of time but good brain excersize...
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This had good twists and turns which kept me wanting more.  A good classic fantasy read.  Onto the next one!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love how you can rearrange it. Perfect size. Fits everything for my camera. You want something to carry your precious camera in? This bag... right here... Buy it :)
B00BD6RFFS|4.0|To be used in brainstorming, evaluation of potential acquisitions, redesigning of business units, etc.<br />The visual appeal of the tool helps people visualize the company as a whole integrated operation.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|EASY TO DOWN LOAD BOOKS, FAST AND COST EFFECTIVE  A A A A A A A A A A A A ++
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept me up nights, and not always in a happy way.<br />But I'm sure that's what Gillian Flynn intended and I don't blame her.<br />It's full of sassy characters who are too stereotyped to be taken for more than book folks, but the way they interact, the tensions that arise, and the wonderful plot twists and turns made this a fun read.<br />I do recommend it.<br />The Missouri setting is wonderful, sort of cushy and sloppy, which may not be exactly fair or right on, but which allowed Amy and Nick plenty of contrast and color in which to play their wicked games.<br />Flynn's descriptive gifts are lavish and she really works them. I may read another book by this author.
0316023744|5.0|I have choosen to give the book 5 stars. I did so because the person I gave the book to has praised it highly
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I have seen every episode of ever Star Trek series available and the Enterprise is by far my favorite with Voyager a close second. Series 1 is outstanding and worth the time to watch them all again.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I think it's very easy to use and very helpful. There always room to for improvement. I think it's better than Bing search engine.
B00BGDF1FO|4.0|I kind of like when the boss battles start, you hear the intro and almost at the end fight. That's when the vocals starts. I say good music for me....
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I worry about security. I think that Facebook can do much better. They keep changing their. Rule and policy. That's sucks.
B00746O3X8|5.0|good easy to carry my cameras now...and for a fraction of the cost. Will recommend to anybody that is on the run.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I spent a lot of time retreading passages. But worth reading for the conclusion. The first person POV is difficult to see whole story.
B0026772N8|4.0|Since I am really interested in Zen now I gave this book a try.  I skipped over many parts but all in all enjoyed it very much.  I may try it again soon.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|Was awesome to hear the music written about in the book Fifty Shades of Grey.  I have really enjoyed this CD and am now thinking about purchasing one that is similar and with more piano.
B009KUANWG|5.0|I have not paid attention to the recent rise in celebrity of the singer Adele, but I have enjoyed this song immensely. It contains the flavor of older Bond themes while providing a vehicle for the singer to reach an audience likely untapped. Her voice is not to be missed. I would recommend this song to anyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game . Very entertaining and addictive. would like a black stallion tho that would be my fav ! But like the white one as well
B0095P31L6|5.0|I was impressed wIth the quality of the movie.  I love this movie and I enjoyed watching it on my roku.
B0009S4IHY|1.0|The disc freezes about 30 seconds into the film and will play past this point. Cleaning the disc does not help either.
B008BM9L72|4.0|It is difficult to know whether the author set out principally to write an erotic novel or a love story.  Both, I suppose.  The second aim is the greater achievement although I suspect that the reason for the success of the book has been based on the first.  I yearn for well written erotica but it is as rare as a successful erotic film.  After the first two or three erotic scenes we know what is going to happen in all the subsequent ones, right down to the use of strange words such as &#34;my breath hitches&#34; whatever that means.  Strip out the repetitive erotica and what remains is an interesting story of a very complicated person's journey to salvation thanks to the help of the woman who supplements the efforts of his psychotherapist so well.
0679809015|3.0|It's a creative idea for a book.  But for a small child even the pages are a little too small.  As an adult, I have to be careful that my hands don't cover parts of the book for my son.  So I'm spending more time trying to make sure things are visible than making the noises with the story.<br /><br />It's a nice book, it is.  The size is why I gave it 3 stars.  I wouldn't have spent the money on a 3.5\\" by 2.5\\" size book.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It was one of the best books I've ever read! It's heartfelt and really shows how hard living with mental illness is.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|This book started out interesting but when info of orphanage abuse kicked in I had a hard time continuing and eventually stopped.  Maybe this was bad timing considering the current and recent revelations of Catholic Church  child molestations.<br />I was warming up to the characters but eventually could not continue.
B0096BIENY|5.0|Could listen to it every day, when I am in my car.  Beautiful and relaxing.  Always brings tears! Well worth the money.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Building your book is great to let you know what you should do before you start your book. It's a step by step guide that offers tips for consideration during the writing process of yur book to ease the conversion process later. I would recommend this to anyone who is thinking of submitting their book to kindle.
B00B2064IY|5.0|This album is definitely Hendrix's material: elements of the music run through all of Hendrix's other material. The lyrics are in his style; bluesy, dreaming, provocative. As good as most of Jimi's past material and worth adding to your collection.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Good as ever a Harry Bosch book could be.  Harry's a sympathetic cop who always gets his man.  I'm waiting for the next one!
B005LAII8A|5.0|The DVD was used but when I inspected it, it was like new!!! It did take a little while to come but it did come within the time estimated. :)
0425252868|5.0|An incredible true story of honor and humanity in the midst of a terrible war. Told honestly about men fighting on both sides.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Okay I delayed reviewing this game for awhile intentionally to give it a fair review. I have played to level 46 out of 65 now and here is my opinion:<br />1. Expect to spend money for acorns unless you have the patience of Job.<br />2. Expect glitches.<br />3. Expect fun but slow leveling after level 40.<br />4.

0575083093|4.0|Many people hypothesize about -- and even look for evidence of -- civilizations in other star systems.  Then there are those who say we should shut down our SETI programs, quit sending probes into the unknown reaches of the galaxy, and stop broadcasting our existence to anything or anybody who may be listening.  We've only been doing it for about 100 years, so maybe we won't be noticed.<br /><br />The reason given for urging Humankind to take and keep a lower galactic profile is known as the \\"Fermi Paradox.\\"  Essentially, this is a theory which posits that once they discover us, other civilizations will, naturally, annihilate us, before we have a chance to annihilate them.  It is not an altogether unreasonable suggestion.<br /><br />In his book \\"Revelation Space,\\" Alastair Reynolds explores the lengths to which another cosmic race might go to keep the galactic peace by ensuring no upstart civilizations -- like us, for instance -- can look to make trouble.  He also shows how our encounters with other galactic residents -- if it ever happens -- might just be laced with intrigue, and full of treachery.<br /><br />As his story unfolds, the reader is acquainted with -- and will probably develop warm, fuzzy feelings for  -- Ana Khouri, a professional assassin; Dan Sylveste, the de rigueur mad scientist, appearing in a bit of a dual role; Ilia Volyova, a tough, savvy interplanetary rouge trader who runs a starship; and Pascale Dubois, introduced as a young journalist following the work of our mad scientist.  There are a few characters the reader will also love to dread, chief among them Sajaki, something like a cyberntically-enhanced samurai who shares authority over the starship.  The development of these and other characters greatly enhances the book's interest.  Reynolds also explores ways in which Human Beings may someday augment our abilities and extend our lives, mostly by use of nano technology.<br /><br />There is a price to pay for the deep background, however -- the story really doesn't pick up steam until you have read a couple hundred pages.  But even the prologue has enough suspense and tension to keep the reader interested, and the deep development of character and personality pays off in spades in the end.<br /><br />Like much great fiction, this yarn is the saga of one man's quest for his interstellar Great White Whale, and how that quest jeopardizes the existence of Humanity.  In the end, Humanity triumphs (maybe), and the mad scientist is rewarded by going to mad scientist Heaven.  Want to know more?  Read the book.<br /><br />I'd have given this work five stars, except that Reynolds spent just a bit too much time with his thesaurus in its writing.  His use of arcane and little-used words and phrases did much, I'm sure, to bolster his opinion of himself.  It did little to increase my enjoyment of his work.  By comparison, Pearl S. Buck never resorted to using obscure words to tell her wonderful stories.  Neither did Ursula K. Le Guin.<br /><br />Hard-core science fiction readers will really enjoy this book, though.  There is enough equasion-bending astrophysical and gravitational theory to keep even the most demanding quantum mechanic satisfied.  There are super-weapons of the future, forbidding planets, and little dive bars on little known worlds that you would love to stumble into.  Enjoy it.

B003VANOFY|5.0|My only complaint with this headset is that when I am not using it to play games, or listen to music, I really miss the 7.1 surround sound. This headset is wonderful for playing games, and has great sound quality. Compared to other headsets I have had, this one is by far the most comfortable and best sounding. Not a big fan of the voice morphing, seems to be a useless feature. Overall I am very happy with this product and from the week I have had it, it seems to be the best headset I've ever owned.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|This is a great movie. I know it got good reviews but it came and went from our local cinemas before we had a chance to see it. The story centers around a sheik's desire to bring salmon fishing to Yemen. Of course the Scotsman charged with accomplishing it, can't see how or why this makes sense. It turns out that the climate and topography are not as poorly suited for salmon fishing as one might imagine. Stocking and redirecting the water enables them to go salmon fishing. There are love interests along the way. And the local tribesmen don't want it to succeed; it goes against Allah's way, in their view. Tensions abound and good triumphs.<br /><br />It's a wonderful movie and will keep you entertained.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|I could not put the book dn.  You had to find out what was going to happen next.  The book did have a good story and I liked the way the author kept you guessing what was going to happen next.
0440243688|5.0|I love the Jack Reacher Series. Have bought every book in the series and have enjoyed every one of them. The only complaint I have is, once you start reading, its hard to put the book down. I just love the character. Lee Child is so descriptive in his writings you become caught in the moment. Such a thrill ride!!
1616550414|5.0|This book was put together very well, and although I personally don't agree with one or two entries in the timeline, they covered all the overlapping story points with an impressive degree of accuracy. The book is bound very well, and the concept art the comic at the end as well as the other odds and ends of the historia make it a totally worth wile purchase for any fan of the series.
B005LAII8A|2.0|I love both Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis.  I like both action and science fiction.  This film simply didn't come together for me.  I had no empathy for the characters.  I can't be sure there wasn't some unique or interesting twist on time travel (other than the ritual execution of one's future self) because I didn't finish watching it, but there were the usual paradox holes for time travel films, and I couldn't forgive them on this occasion.  The plot shuffled along at a stoner's pace without a stoner's humor.
0062511408|5.0|Love this book and love this author cant wait to read more of his books. Got two copies, I believe this book can be a great gift no matter what kind of person is receiving  it.
B005LAII3A|2.0|While I can appreciate why there are those who think this version was better and/or closer to the book than the Schwarzenegger version, I could not get past how derivative it was.  It was like a music track that had over-sampled other works so it had no beat of its own.  I was hugely into science fiction as a teenager and I still love it, so I was very aware that nearly every scene in this film was derived from another SF film - it was a patchwork quilt in which the stitching was both obvious and fraying.  The main actors are all very pretty (Colin Farrell has never looked better, Kate Beckinsale is stunningly typecast and Jessica Biel earnestly smoulders), but they don't save this otherwise paltry re-make... unless you treat it as a trivial pursuit quiz to see who can identify the origin from which each scene was derived.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|One of the all time greatest epic films.  With plenty of extras.  The ultimate collectors edition that everyone should own
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Argo very much deserved the 2013 Best Picture Oscar.  This film was nail-bitingly gripping.  If some dramatic licence was taken for cinematic effect it was well worth it.  The story was incredible and the screenplay was smart.  The evocation of the 70s was fantastic.  While it was an ensemble piece in which all of the actors did a great job, Ben Affleck stood out.  His portrayal of Tony Mendez was understated and assured. Definitely the best new release I have seen in the last year.
0062082353|5.0|I haven't read the book but I know that this man was a hero and the way he died was ridiculous.  The seller delivered the book on promptly and in great packaging.
0553062182|5.0|I learned about this book from a meetup.com group and I said &#34;highly sensitive person&#34;? That sounds like me! So I was very intrigued and bought the book. This book has been a big eye opener for me. When I was a kid I was always shy, clumsy, creative and I felt like I was different and there was something wrong with me. I am so grateful to this book for showing me that there is not something wrong with me, and there are many people out there that feel the same way. I feel less isolated and hopeless now. I also realized that many people in my life were highly sensitive persons and were also suffering from our society's lack of understanding about it. I have recommended this book to many of them. In addition, I realized that those people who really irritate me (a few family members, a couple co-workers) were highly UN-sensitive persons which has helped me understand them better. I understand that when they start up a conversation with me on my lunch break (a time that I use to be quiet and wind down) they think they are helping me when in fact they are really aggravating me. So I've learned that they really mean well because for them, social activity is a way to recharge (for me it's the opposite). I have also learned that in order to continue being a productive, creative and happy person, I need to take a lot of time out and instead of unwinding with the 500 page September issue of Vogue, I unwind in the quiet of nature. But the biggest benefit I've gained is knowing that our society has a serious prejudice against our kind and that I don't have to feel bad about it anymore. In fact, I feel like I have a special contribution to make to our society. This June, I'm going to see Elaine Aron talk and I'm really excited!
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is the best series I have ever watched.  It is not just a Zombie movie, it is a movie about human nature and how we potentially will react as individuals when faced with the collapse of society.

B00BHNR1KQ|3.0|This has all the workings of an older horror movie, like walking around the house looking for the strange sounds but not turning on the lights or checking out the strange sounds coming from the attic but using the Cell Phone as a flashlight instead of getting the real flashlight.

B00006RHUW|1.0|it could not be played on my DVR because it was not formatted for my region. had i known this i never would have ordered it. and to pay to ship it back is almost more than what it cost. that's ridiculous. i would not recommend this to my worst enemy.<br />WHY DID YOU GIVE THIS A FOUR AND ONE HALF RATING? SURELY THAT WAS NOT MY SUGGESTION. FOR WHAT THEY DID AND FROM A RECENT E-MAIL THAT THEY SENT ME, THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE A STAR PERIOD. I WENT BACK ON LINE TO CHECK WHAT I ORDERED. UNDER PRODUCT DETAILS UNDER THE HEADING REGION: IT SAYS REGION 1 (U.S. AND CANADA ONLY). AND THEY HAD NERVE ENOUGH TO SAY THEY ARE WILLING TO TAKE IT BACK EVEN THOUGH IT WAS OPENED. IF I DIDNT OPEN IT HOW WOULD I KNOW THEY HAD SENT ME THE WRONG THING. MY DVR SAID \\"EJECT THIS DISC---REGION ERROR\\" IT IS NOT LIKE I WAS IN A STORE AND PICKED UP THE WRONG THING, THEY SENT THE WRONG THING.

B006LSZECO|4.0|After avoiding another story of the Bad Husband , I began this book only under the pressure of friends.  At first I was enthralled by the brilliant dialogue and the character  s social comments on relationships.  Then the twists and subterfuge left me eagerly reading nonstop.  A fun ride.
0062209493|5.0|Great book.  Sorry to lose such a hero.  I highly recommend this book.  It would be well worth your time.
B004U8VUUC|4.0|I listened to most of the book as my wife read it.  The rest I read by myself.  I would promote this to people who are looking for a good ending.
B006LSZECO|4.0|If I could give it 4.5 stars I would.  It was more than a like but not *quite* a love.  I have read countless thrillers/novels that attempt to surprise you with twists and turns but end up being completely contrived; Gone Girl was not one of those books.  I found it an engaging story from start to finish, exploring the complexities of relationships and the human psyche.  That's not to say I identified with the main characters - which normally makes reading a book difficult for me - but I found them well developed and intriguing enough that I began to understand their motivations and decisions, whether I would feel/do the same or not.  Word to newlyweds or newly betrothed: an uplifting story about marriage, this is not.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|I love the story line and the characters.  Not to give out any spoilers or anything but the writers are merciless with killing off the lead roles.
B003O86FMW|4.0|As I said, the first book is better than this one. This is still a good book, but only if you read the first one, begin from this book won`t be good for you.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|Probably the tenth time I've read this book and its awesome every time. If your on the fence about it you won't be sorry.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I adore Rice 's fast packed adventures. Much like Tolkien one story becomes many side stories, each land, adventure even people described so lavishly you feel you're there. Only negative is in the editing. Many misspelled words even given names. Gwen/Gwyn happens every other page. I find that ridiculous. She is a main character. Ms. Rice needs a new editing team and her work would become fast classics.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Would have given this game 10 stars before Zenga updated it. I use updated very loosely. It is not the game it was in 2012 and many people I know will no longer play it. Too bad it WAS a great game.

1451627297|5.0|Even before I'd finished, had a copy shipped to my Mom. She lived through that era as a young adult, and I'm looking forward to her thoughts on Mr. King's recreation of that world ... because for my money, it was perfect. Having been born five or so years after Kennedy I can't say I was there, but wasn't too far off. And there were a lot of family photos that paint a picture very much like the one King does.<br /><br />Read some of the other reviews, and felt compelled to add my two cents after seeing comments like:<br /><br />\\"King hasn't been at his best for 20 years.\\"<br />\\"Jake Epping's character is pretty much Stephen King himself.\\"<br />\\"The talent show scene went on too long.\\"<br /><br />My responses: bull, so what, and grow an attention span.<br /><br />King went through a brief dark period, but let's give him a damn break already. He's past it, and turning out some of his best work if you're paying attention. Yes, there's a definite similarity between Jake Epping and Stephen King ... how is that a flaw? He created a hero he could relate to in hopes we would too, and you know what? I did. Should the protagonist have been Bartleby the Scrivener? If I'm honest, the talent show scenes strained my attention span just a little ... maybe a page too long at most? But since those scenes are pretty central to Jake and Sadie's story, I just read the extra damn page. Gratefully.<br /><br />I used to read King because I loved horror, and this book has its scares, no question. But while he's always been able to bring characters alive, make them convincing and sympathetic, this is the first King novel I remember bringing tears to my eyes, more than once. And to borrow a line from the book ... I'm not what you'd call a crying man. But anyone who isn't touched by what time puts Jake and Sadie through needs a soul transplant. Some of the scenes between them are just heart-wrenchingly beautiful. King's love story within a larger tale gets a late start in the novel, but by the time he's done, it's all about Jake and Sadie.<br /><br />Yet it's not all about them, as Jake eventually learns. King evokes plenty of sympathy from the reader for what Jake and Sadie endure, but time itself has absolutely none.time he's done, it's all about Jake and Sadie.<br /><br />Yet it's not all about them, as Jake eventually learns.

B0053JJLLC|4.0|This novel has all of Crichton's classic ingredients: new technology, its good and bad use, the consequences of both, good guys, bad guys, something that get out of control and so on.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Well..first I have to say I truly liked this book a lot! I got it on my kindle last year and couldn't get past the first 10 pages. I thought..what is this nonsense? And put it down. Honestly I think I just missed my vampires (my usual reads)its now a year later and a friend told me I need to try again(thanks heather) and so I did. Boy was I glad! I literally stayed up till 1am reading and left 2 chapters to go. I finished it up at lunch..man..talk about an adrenaline rush! Abby and Travis may not be the most stable couple and they are extremely jealous whenever someone of the opposite sex looks at them or talks to them, but What couple do you know that didn't/don't feel like or act like that at one time or another? exactly!Yeah sometimes it's extreme but,who cares!love is supposed to be crazy, spontaneous and out of control..It wouldn't be love if it wasnt. but I believe they do love each other. Call it co-dependent, call it sick..I call it fiction! I like fluff books, if I wanted depressing and sad, I'd watch the news. If this isn't your type of book, then don't read it. I can't wait for Walking Disaster..though I'm a little scared of what crap is gonna happen in that one. I don't know if my head can take it..lol..I give this book 5 stars! Looking forward to meeting Jamie at our book store in April:) a must read in my opinion.

Dear god this woman was insufferable and bratty. She really despised Lizzy and for what reason I can't put my finger on. It was fairly close to the movie, minus a few things.

This book really works well to give diet, supplement and training information in a very straightforward manner. There is a lot of valuable insight. Perhaps the best part of the book is the ability to contact the author. I emailed Mike with some questions after reading the book and he replied quickly. I would say at this price, it was well worth my money.

0399245030|2.0|The artwork in this book is beautiful, peaceful and touching. The writing is poor. I would have almoat rathered no words. As a veteran preschool teacher of twenty years and a mother of three, I find the writing to be quite amateur. As I am reading the book to my youngest daughter, 3 years old, I am re-writing the story to simplfy the language. It's too flowery and extraneous. For example, the author writes  &#34;The boy could not sleep for dissapointment.&#34; Better to simply write &#34;The boy could not sleep.&#34;
0061950726|4.0|Rich in themes centered around families and parenting ORPHAN TRAIN is a short very readable novel.  The book has two orphaned women as heroines, seventeen year old Molly and ninety-one year old Vivian.  Molly's father a Native American was killed when she was a young child and her mother who could not cope retreated to a life of drug abuse.  Molly begrudgingly lives in contemporary Maine with a foster family who do not respect her intelligence or belief system.  Molly won my sympathy as her favorite book JANE EYRE is my favorite book and she loves the novel so much she tries to steal a copy from the public library.  Sentenced to community service for this attempted theft she finds a placement helping ninety-one year old Vivian sort through her boxes of accumulated possessions in the attic of her large ocean front home.  Vivian came to New York City from Ireland with her parents as a child.  When most of her family was killed in a tenement fire Vivian (originally Niamh) was placed on an orphan train going west with the hope of finding an adoptive family.  Her first two placements in the state of Minnesota were disastrous but she eventually found a stable home that helped launch her life as a productive adult.<br /><br />Molly and Vivian discover the bonds they share and learn from each other despite their great age difference.  Molly is even able to use the internet to help Vivian find information about old friends and family members whose fates she has always wondered about.  The book appears to be well researched and despite some of the hardships described ORPHAN TRAIN is ultimately hopeful and optimistic.
B0090SI3ZW|5.0|This movie is highly entertaining and if your plan is to sit down for a few hours and watch a movie to have a good time, this is a blockbuster. Even if you're some dude wanting to chill with a movie and your girl Friday night,she'll enjoy the movie with you. there is a lot of reviewers saying the movie isn't this or that, but I'm thinking people got too hyped up with Tarantino's name thrown about, and that was bound to happen(Django anyone?)...but it's a excellent movie highlighting Rza's mythology, music, and talent. You'll love the amazing performances from Russell Crowe, Lucy-Lu, The Lion Brothers(?), Bautista, and Rza himself. The soundtrack is rocking and the Kung-Fu is ToP NoTCh...
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|This app is okay, I did not find anything special about it, no real WOW factor for me.  But it works.  I think they could have added the ability to change the color or make it flash, just something to make it POP.  But again it works.

B000NH7SZ0|5.0|I'll keep this review short.  It works great on my HP LaserJet Pro 400 Color M475DW printer.  I'm sure it will work on all 300 & 400 series printers.  HP wanted a ludicrous amount for their memory, so I chose to look up a 256MB module from a reputable manufacturer that meet the right specs.  I found this Kingston memory and plugged it in.  Success!  Printer recognizes the added memory.  I threw some big jobs at it to see how it would perform.  Flawless.  Highly recommend.

B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Excellent transfer to Blu-Ray.  But watching this anew, is different this time.<br /><br />The ethical and moral power is so compelling, with such gifted and inspired distillation and editing.  So far ahead of anything else, today, that it poses a disturbing paradigm:  Why does our culture not show more signs of impact from this film?<br /><br />When I took family to see it at Ritz downtown Philadelphia 12/31/93, it was part of a phenomenon, and the news and airwaves were filled with references to 'Schindlers List'.  Watching it now, with that phenomenon and awareness long behind, it is perplexing that this corrective has faded from public and church consciousness, and is not more relevant.  The context now is this:  our theatres and cable channels have some great stuff these days.  Showtime's 'Homeland', Starz: 'Boss', the Oscar nominees 'Flight' (Denzel Washington, fantastic), 'The Master', 'Lincoln' and more. (Even if the more popular fare inevitably remains entertainment and Gladiator style violence).<br /><br />But 'Schindler's List' transcends everything, an unparalleled artistic achievement and moral purgative.  Watching this on Blu-Ray now, It is shocking that 20 years later, it has not grabbed greater ongoing impact and awareness.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This series is the very best I have ever read. My only complaint will be if The Winds of Winter is not released very quickly. Great read!
B009PK9SB8|4.0|Well, I have been through several action cams and I must say that the video quality on the GoPro Hero series has been the best. I have pretty much settled in to the Veho MUVI HD line and the GoPro Hero3 Black edition.<br /><br />The only thing the irked me about the GoPro was the exclusion of an LCD preview screen. Now, granted for many uses and LCD screen is well....useless. But there are those times when having the screen is the difference between the perfect angle and wasted SD Card space and time.<br /><br />How would you like to get home just to find out that you had the camera at an angle that looked just goofy?<br /><br />On to the screen....Well, it's pretty simple really. You snap it on the back of the GoPro (like many other of the accessories for this cam) and you are off. What does it allow for? Well, the obvious is the ability to preview what you are shooting and also to review what you have shot. The other, VERY important advantage is the ability to navigate the menus (something that I feel the Veho MUVI HD NAILS!!!). The screen turns this otherwise daunting (ok maybe not daunting, but pretty cruddy) task into a few touches here and there. Oh yeah, and the waterproof casing for the screen works remarkably well in terms of responsiveness through the membrane.<br /><br />The main disadvantage that I see is the battery life reduction. Ok, the battery life on the GoPro is already not too awesome, but with the screen it gets worse. Again, remember what this camera is for and you will be fine.

B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|My husband and I are classic gamers and this movie has a little bit for everyone. I enjoyed the story and even got a little teary over some of the scenes. Worth seeing with your kids and even just with your spouse, a very funny movie. I am sad I didn't get to see it in the theater but it is hard to go to movies with an 8 month old.<br /><br />I can not wait for my son to get old enough to enjoy this movie with us. I think he will find it fun.

B0060AY6FO|5.0|The characters in the book were brought alive in print.  The depth of the personality of each person was interesting to see grow as the story progressed.  The twists and intrigues were a delight to read.  I couldn't wait to read the ending.  How it changed so many lives.<br /><br />This is the first book I have read  of P.D. James and will certainly be reading many of her other books.  What a gifted writer!

0765325950|4.0|This is about what I expected and I've been waiting for almost twenty years for this, so that alone is worth four stars. Not a five star because I simply wanted more follow up with the characters. But there were several times when I cried throughout the book and in fact when the last few pages loomed in front of me, I went into the living room and told my roommate that I simply could not be alone while I read it! I will totally and completely miss these characters and am saddened by the fact that there will be no more novels about the Fourth Age. Or the Age of Legends. So many possibilities with the characters. Alas, it will probably never happen.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|Good for both guy and gal to watch together.  Action and suspense. Actors/Actresses are all good too.  Perhaps the hero is a bit too heroic for reality, but such is the way of many a good flick.

B005LW5J9O|3.0|A very nice read. Excellent story and details. I felt I was part of the hunt through the musty monasteries of Europe.  Yet, Stephen seems to get carried away with his theory as to the importance of this one book.  Take a deep breath, there were many forces at work as the world moved toward modernity.  I suspect the world would still be modern without Lucretius.

It was great to see how the relationships were between the service people and the royal family.  I liked how polite and considered they were of each other.  The end of the season was a surprise when Matthew was killed right after the baby was born.  I don't understand why they have so much death.  But I still loved the show.  It was very addicting, I couldn't wait to watch the next eposide.  Please bring out season 4 asap!

It's a challenge but not too hard I give up.<br />  I'm not a huge Star Wars fan, but this was recomended to me...and I'm glad it was. I have completely enjoyed the birds that do &#34;star wars&#34; things...it's made playing it so much fun.<br />  Woth the money...still happy with the purchase. (That speaks volumnes.)

B006LSZECO|4.0|The writer Tom McIntyre (The Snow Leopard’s Tale, Dreaming the Lion, Seasons & Days), once made a comment to me to the effect that he couldn’t bear to read any of the current crop of ballyhooed, hip-and-happening young authors because they had all grown up in relatively well-to-do urban or suburban homes, gone to good schools and good colleges and then to the Iowa Writer’s Workshop and from there to New York, without ever doing anything, and then they all wrote immense dusty tomes about the terrible stresses and neuroses of growing up in relatively well-to-do urban or suburban homes and going to good schools and good colleges and then on to the Iowa Writer’s Workshop and from there to New York, without ever doing anything. This may be an unfair assessment on Tom’s part, since he is doubtless contrasting their experience with his own, and he has done an incredible number of adventurous things in the old-fashioned, two-fisted Hemingway tradition, but it’s also a criticism that has a good deal of truth to it.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn, author of Gone Girl, grew up in a well-to-do home in Kansas City, went to good schools and a good college (University of Kansas), got her master’s degree in journalism from Northwestern, and went to New York. Gone Girl is about a young married couple who grew up in well to do homes, went to good schools and good colleges…<br /><br />So, for the first part of this three-part novel, we are in the familiar territory of (fill in the name of practically any successful and critically acclaimed American author of the last fifteen or twenty years), exploring the familiar joys and stresses of marriage, love, passionate sex, compromise, the shades of growing estrangement, all the normal—and familiar—stages of modern matrimony. But Gillian Flynn has transformed this routine fare into a marriage of the damned seen through a series of distorted fun-house mirrors, so that just about the time I started wondering, as I have with (fillin the title of practically any critically acclaimed book by practically any…etc.), why the hell I was wasting my time reading this, the first hints began coming, pale, faint adumbrations of something slightly off, distortions in the mirrors. It wasn’t much, but it was enough to make me stick with it, and hoo-boy! I’m glad I did.<br /><br />The second part of this book is where Ms. Flynn takes us behind the mirrors. Since I would not be doing you or her any kindness to spoil the surprises that come, I will only say she paints as convincing and chilling a portrait of a sociopath as I have encountered in a long time. I once had the misfortune to become enmeshed with a sociopath myself, and I count myself lucky to be alive; Ms. Flynn’s creation makes the sociopath in my life look like a Sunday school teacher. She has created a thing of icy, implacable, ruthless narcissism that is like a real-life super villain—unstoppable, indestructible, a terminator, something that cannot be killed, because it has no life to begin with, a thing without a heart, without a soul, a thing concerned only with its own needs and wants and desires, a human version of the man-eating plant in Little Shop of Horrors: “Feed me, Seymour!” If you are married, or have any hope of ever becoming married, don’t read the second part of this book.<br /><br />Actually, if you’re married, or have any hope of ever becoming married, don’t read the third part of this book either. Again, I don’t want to spoil things, so let me just say that Ms. Gillian turns the screw, slowly, from unusual and unexpected angles, and she ends the book in a way that… No. I’ll leave it there.<br /><br />Is Gone Girl a perfect book? No. Readers with working familiarity of police procedure will recognize certain liberties taken, and there are some gaps in the plot, but you probably won’t notice these until long after you’ve put the book back on the shelf. Besides, Raymond Chandler and Alfred Hitchcock both managed to entertain us very well even as they took enormous liberties. Did I come away with a richer understanding of the human condition? If you include inhuman sociopaths as humans, yes, but otherwise, no. On the other hand, that isn’t why I purchased the book. I wanted to be entertained, and I was. I also had nightmares. One last comment: if I were married to Gillian Flynn, I would be very, scrupulously, uxoriously polite to her. She is a seriously demented puppy.

1558908382|5.0|[[ASIN:B002JOUNE8 Say Anything... (20th Anniversary Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B00009OWJY The Sure Thing (Special Edition)]] and GROSSE POINTE BLANK are always jockeying for top honors as my all-time favorite John Cusack picture. Should I have a yen for a John Hughes type of film, then the first two films above tend to inch ahead. But if I'm craving something more subversive, then I must roll with GROSSE POINTE BLANK. John Cusack may have cornered the market on those intelligent everyman roles. He's always presented this impression that complicated gears are always whirring around in his skull. In GROSSE POINTE BLANK, a freakin' delicious black comedy, Cusack's internal conflict has never been more pronounced.<br /><br />Martin Blank is a burnt-out hit man, and maybe his moral flexibility has at last reached that snapping point. Martin has just botched his last kill. One could tell his heart wasn't in it. His employers are cheesed, royally so. He's given one chance to atone. Accordingly, the next job takes him to his hometown of Detroit.<br /><br />Martin isn't one for nostalgia. Still, there's that pang of curiosity when he learns of his impending tenth year high school reunion (Class of '86, huzzah!). Check this: Martin Blank is touted as \\"Detroit's Most Famous Disappearing Act,\\" given that the last anyone had seen of him, he was standing up Debi Newberry on prom night. Down the years, people assumed that he either got murdered or brainwashed or had joined a cult. You'd think it'd be a bit late (and unprofessional) for Martin Blank to develop angst, and yet there it is. In Detroit he can't help but hearken back, and especially hearken back to Debi Newberry (Minnie Driver) who today is a popular radio DJ. She's not afraid to call him out on his past transgressions.<br /><br />In Detroit, Martin's personal life intrudes into his professional one. And, yeah, maybe it's hard to keep your eyes on the prize when you visit your old home only to find out that it's been torn down and replaced with a homogeneous convenience store. An exasperated (yet philosophical) Martin reflects: \\"You can never go home again... but you can shop there.\\" Lest you think this movie fixates too much on angsty navel-gazing, know that there's ample action to rev up the pace. Martin's Detroit assignment isn't as by the numbers as he'd assumed, not with his rival, Mr. Grocer (Dan Ackroyd), so violently intent on poaching the kill contract. Goes to show, the murder game is such a competitive field. In fact, someone in the film refers to it as a \\"growth industry.\\" Heh. By the way, it's pretty nifty seeing Ackroyd switch things up and get all sinister. Still, the action highlight has to be Cusack's hallway death match with legendary martial artist Benny \\"the Jet\\" Urquidez. It's just cool to see Cusack in a brutal, drag-out fight, even though, okay, the more advanced moves were probably performed by a stunt double.<br /><br />Minnie Driver has never been more appealing, and she's got great chemistry with Cusack, and her Yank accent is again impeccable. Their interactions make for some stand-out moments. But then again I find that Cusack has great chemistry with everyone onscreen. His scenes with Ackroyd are marvelous, and I have to reiterate how pleased I was at Ackroyd's unexpected and very effective turn as the big bad. Cusack's real-life sister, Joan, has a nifty bit part as his assistant Marcella. I am become jaded at her history of excellent scene-stealing. I love how she takes these roles that could have been these unassuming roles and steers them down unexpected avenues. Lastly, Alan Arkin made me laugh out loud each time he was onscreen here. He plays Cusack's very, very nervous psychiatrist who finds himself constantly walking on eggshells during their sessions.<br /><br />John Cusack anchors this thing. He's one of the few really interesting and quirky actors out there today whose movies I'll check out even if, going in, I don't what they're about. He's surpassed Tom Hanks as my favorite contemporary actor some time ago. I love the innate intelligence and the casual humor and the wry, detached approach he applies. It's fascinating watching Cusack work and how he manifests his internal process by virtue of body language and a repertoire of revealing expressions and by nuanced (yet deadpan) intonation. I don't know that there's anyone else out there who can better articulate the role of an assassin-for-hire who develops a conscience. John Cusack can play just about anything, except an idiot. I don't think he knows how to do that.passed Tom Hanks as my favorite contemporary actor some time ago. I love the innate intelligence and the casual humor and the wry, detached approach he applies.

B000QDA7OU|5.0|I've seen this movie twice and still found it worth adding to my 'classic' library.  It's a good window into the 'person' behind the 'habit.'  I don't know about you but until you know where a nun came from you only see the nun, not the person. They don't wear thier life story where we can see it, yet how often do we consider the 18+ years of a nuns life before she became a nun. Or how often do we consider that she is still a woman in and on our earhly globe. Did she have hopes and dreams in her nun-hood? And of course who wouldn't want to see the lovely Ms. Hepburn play such a role. She does not disappoint. Nor does this film. But then, this is my review, not everyone elses. :)
B00821OX98|5.0|The show has been around since 2011, but I just got around to watching it recently (thanks Amazon Prime!).  I wasn't sure if I'd like it at first, but about 3 episodes in I was hooked.  The main plot is pretty basic... Aliens invaded and kicked the human's butts.  The show follows the members of a small band of freedom fighters called the 2nd Massachusetts and focuses on how the characters evolve individually and as a group.<br /><br />The show focuses mostly on character development and the complexities of various relationships; military and civilians, parents and kids, friends and foes, and so on.  I especially enjoy the dynamic between the Captain of the 2nd Mass, who is a trained military leader, and his second in command, who is a history professor.  But there is also a surprising (to me at least) amount of action and plot driven events as well.  There are very few things to dislike about the show.  Of course you're going to have the occasional, &#34;hey, that's not realistic!&#34; moment, but its a TV show and there are fewer of those than you might expect.<br /><br />Overall, I think the show is great and definitely worth watching.  My biggest complaint is that there are only 2 seasons currently on Amazon, and that each season only has 10 episodes.  I want to watch more than that!

B008KMHFJY|4.0|Okay, I have a somewhat love hate relationship with this book. I first read it just before the hype for this book took off and found it to a captivating read. It also began my love affair for indie authors, who in my opinion can write stories with original and spellbinding books more than their published counterparts.<br /><br />Anyway, on my second read, after reading many more great indie books, the amateur almost juvenile writing seemed more evident to me and I just didn't enjoy it quite as much as the first time around. Travis is...intense...in his love for Abby. Abby just s***ted me and I found her lacking in some way and kept thinking, why is Travis so into this girl??<br /><br />Having said that, it is a good story if you like the whole reformed manwhore who is totally in love with the heroine to the point of dysfunction. Which what this book is about, how two dysfunctional young people can come together and be happy in their own dysfunctional \\"beautiful disaster\\" way.<br /><br />4 stars.

At first I thought the Tree was mentioned at the beginning and at the end of the story but what I found out after I read the last two paragraphs the tree grow throughout the whole novel. How love beyond all lives mishaps stayed strong and lived.!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a good app because it always have a new update like every month...and its always something new! Love this game
B0033806MI|3.0|Nos ayuda aconocer un poco mas de los personajes q adoramos.... nos da pistas de lo q viene y detalles pa ra la siguiente saga...
B008OOYALE|4.0|It's ok it's not like the other ones there better than this one it gets boring after a little bit it's not the best at all!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a fun game. I think that the concept of \\"World Tour\\" is cool too. The game has some glitches, like when a new daily challenge is available it just says \\"time left until daily challenge: 00:00\\" which kinda sucks
B0076DELIG|4.0|Fans won't be disappointed. Harry is pushing retirement. How many mysteries can be left? Interesting plot as usual with good procedural details.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very good and addicting but I shall warn you you get to make updates so you can travel to Rome ,Europe and even more.
1608955702|5.0|Just finished Neil's latest book and found it to be excellent, as were his first two books.  One of the things I particularly liked about all his books is that the referenced images are generally on the same or adjacent open page.  Occasionally, you have to flip one page.  Makes for very easy reading .  And he covers many situations such as \\"Available light with rim lighting\\", \\"Manual or TTL\\", \\"Separation with backlighting\\", etc.  After a second reading this book will become a reference book just to keep his ideas fresh in my mind.  The author is not \\"long winded\\" with lots of superfluous words filling the page.  He gets to the point using examples (sometimes images which have been on his website -- but so what?  They illustrate his lesson perfectly.)<br />  In my collection of over a dozen books, Neil's three are my favorite \\"go to\\" references when I want to reinforce some idea. I would recommend reading the first two books before this one if you are a beginner.  OK to start with \\"Direction and Quality of Light\\" if you are advanced.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Me and one of my friends love your books. She has drawn every title picture on all of your books from book one to the last one
B005NJU8PA|5.0|i always enjoy Tim's approach to different subjects.  Very fun to read.  Highly reccomended.  A great how to manual on many topics.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it! I love horses and cannot afford one. For me this is the next best thing. And a game I don't need to spend money on.
1907590331|1.0|After reading the book, it appears to me to be a story of mentally retarded people narrated in their own language. There is no psychological or philosophical insight in the novel. In fact, I did not find a single fresh thought or an intelligent or even intelligible idea.<br /><br />This is a story of how a few people of less than an average intelligence casually kill dogs and each other. I am quite aware that such people exist and that they can hardly speak their native tongue, but I cannot relate to such people and I positively do not want to associate with them. I am afraid that this is the first and the last book by Steinbeck that I intend to read.
076115678X|5.0|My curls went from a dry, brittle, wavy, mess to a full head of lush bouncy curls following this book's recommendations & using the DEVA products.  I used to wear my long hair tied back or up most days, and now I wear it down - full & curly - almost every day.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|I enjoyed the story of the little lost girl who found her way.  The grim realities of homelessness and the beauty of flowers were quite a contrast that made the story work.  The meaning of the varieties of flowers was informative and interesting.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Entire program addictive.  Cross between &#34;Lord of the Flies&#34; meets &#34;Survivor&#34;.  Each season brings amazing suspense.  Probably best program on TV.  and I am 77 years old.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Does anybody really have to rate Adobe for one to know what they are getting?  Adobe Reader should be standard issue on anything computer related.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Not what I expected at all. Judging by the movie previews I decided I'd read the book before seeing the film. Thinking it was another romantic comedy, I was way off. Very touching and real, loved the journey!
B008YKGQR4|2.0|Just as easy to open up Chrome browser on our Kindle Fire HD 7 and access Facebook.  Removed app almost as fast as we put it on.
B001F4UHGC|5.0|I am a big Steve McQueen fan and this movie is on of his best.  The chase scenes thru the streets on San Francisco are incredible.  He was an amazing actor who never got credit for his blue eyes.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This should be your first app loaded on a Kindle Fire HD 7.  Personally, I think it should be part of the stock software that comes on a Kindle Fire HD 7.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|The second review I saw assured me that all scores and progress would remain when the paid version replaced the free one. So I bought the ad-free version. And now all the games show 0. I'm not happy at all. I didn't get anything I had earned carried over to the ad-free version: no special helps or even the eagle I purchased and was supposed to be available for play forever.<br /><br />Update: Even though I purchased this ad-free version, I have ads for Angry Birds other games and options for this game that appear WHILE I'M PLAYING! I mean it: A bird can be in mid flight when the screen suddenly has an ad to buy the Eagle to help with difficult levels. I have to close these ads for Bad Piggies and other products before I can continue my game. This is NOT what I expected when I purchased the game.
B009NPLIFE|4.0|I loved this series.  The last season was to short, so I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  However, I got 10 stars enjoyment, out of the whole<br />series.  Great fun!!!!<br />Watching it on the computer was easy.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|This movie about Hitchcock's making of Psycho is really a study of his personality and director's technique.  It is also an endearing and realistic picture of the give and take of an affectionate middle age marital relationship between two very strong personalities. As you watch the movie try to remember the social mores of the times and the general attitude culture of the 1960's.  While Psycho is not a movie I want to see again, many of Alfred Hitchcock other films are memorable and repeatable.
B0049J3QAY|5.0|My 3 year old son and I watched monsters, Inc. for the first time together...It was my second or third time watching it! Jayden is his name(my 3 year old) laughed a lot while watching the movie... he made watching the movie fun even though I have watched it before. Great movie!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Ben Affleck does a remarkable job with this film.  The story line is not a light one and requires your attention, but if you remember this event at all, it is highly interesting to see how it really played out.
B00BHNR1KQ|4.0|I thought the movie was very entertaining, and scary at the same time! This movie had a lot of surprises... I couldn't take my eyes off the screen... I would watch this movie again...
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Bad Piggies HD Free (Kindle Tablet Edition) - The children in my household love to play this game like they enjoy Angry Birds.  Without realizing it, the older ones especially, are learning physics.
B00A6N7BS0|5.0|Very entertaining, and engaging... Great scenery ! Lots of action and cool characters... I can watch this movie over and over again...
B009PK9SB8|5.0|This LCD Touch BacPac is much better price than local.  Features are great for Hero 3 especially the touch response control.
B00AYB20KI|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed in this movie...There was so much hype for this film. It was not supernatural as it was projected to be.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This movie is a must see.  It's heartwarming, true, and inspiring.<br />The acting is so perfect and real.  A great job done by all.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Had an awesome representative (Debra) who assisted me with urgency and empathy. She truly deserve a raise for overlooking my tone at the beginning of the call. Even set an appointment to confirm my satisfaction with the free chargers being delivered at no cost.And to top that I could not remember my password and she assisted with that as well, making me feel better and better every second on the phone. I hope that all of the reprensentives are representing their poducts as well as (Debra)she went beyond technical support and assured me that the cord will be delivered in two days , reset my password and did not sound as if she was dreading her job. Thanks so much amazon for honoring your products.
B000HIVIOW|4.0|I had this as a child growing up and remembered loving it every time we watched it. It disappeared into the VHS void as a lot of movies from the 90s did, but when I saw it was available here I couldn't resist securing this film for myself considering the cheap price.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|get this game it THE BEST. sure it might have adds but forget it its WORTH IT..;) if u don't take it from me try it for yourself u wont reg4et.it
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Very pleased with the delivery of the electronic media and the ease of access.  Look forward to more Amazon purchases.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|In the beginning I had trouble following the move it was a little disconnected.  But by the end I enjoyed it
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I have never read such a lovely,realistic,sad,dramatic,understanding book in all my life besides this book The Book Thief  is the greatest book I ever read.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Best yet in the sequence.  Cant wait for the next movie in the series.  Cant get enough have watched multiple times.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love this game. Makes me want a real horse! Wish it was . Easier to earn coins and gems though
B006WXHJNU|5.0|I needed to have this to watch in High def.  I enjoyed enough to own.  cant wait for the for the next movie for a shield member.
B006PAZMMK|4.0|I dig it, but I'm already tired of it. Gotta be in the right mood, otherwise it might drive you nuts!
B0012TWRAO|5.0|I used this base to mount a Hero camera to my motorcycle handlebar with great results.  The rubber caps that cover the ends of the the u-bolt look like they could easily fall off but haven't so far and not a major problem.  Other than that, top notch.
B004GGM444|4.0|Not bad. Probably one of his better albums. I have to be in the right mood to listen to it. Otherwise it might give someone an anxiety trip!
6304490399|5.0|Bought this for a friend who is no longer able to Race himself.  This movie makes him feel that he is right there in the center of the action.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|A great addition to the story if you liked the first one and the movie you will live this book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is written and acted so wonderfully, it is hard to stop watching it once you begin.  The story line is not only engaging, but fascinating; especially due to the time period and the way that life during that time is portrayed.<br /><br />I heartily recommend Downton Abbey.  My only complaint is that the third season isn't available for free streaming for Prime members.  I don't want to wait until it is, but I also don't want to &#34;waste&#34; my prime membership fee.
B0050VJ29Y|4.0|Bought this on a whim. Different but very enjoyable. Jack White and Norah Jones contribute a lot to this CD. The music is almost ethereal in parts!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Katniss and Peeta have to go into the hunger games again, but this time with the remaining pool of tributes! Will they survive the seventy-fifth annual hunger games?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is fantastic. The Hunger Games is a great book, and it is very descriptive. I would read this book over and over again. It is also very sad. If you are going to read this book, watch the movie after it.
B0012FHGCW|4.0|Worth watching.  Interesting insight to a young man's relationship with his family and what to do with his life.<br />I would watch this movie again.
B007REV4T8|4.0|They took their time and found a script for their film and fit for a capable cast. They found a capable director who made use of his resources. The 007 series suffered from a lack of patience on the part of producers. I don't blame Sean Connery for looking elsewhere for work. These films were becoming cash cows for the studios. How can you cast The Saint as 007? Roger Moore's films as 007 were plain bad. So I was surprised with Casino Royale and impressed by the consistency from the next two. Not just with Craig but the entire effort. If they take their time and put together a good film I won't hesitate to hold the opinion that these are the best 007 films to date.
1449410243|3.0|As much as I love The Oatmeal, and having this book around is fun for guests to pickup and thumb through, the majority of the content isn't really funny. The free content on the website is more well-thought, and the variety is better as well. If you're cool with this, and want to support more print books from Inman, it's worth the single-digit dollars it'll set you back.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|They missed something. It was well written and directed. Good acting. I do think that they were short on the story in Teheran. Of course real stories sometimes limit the development of the story. In a film like Zero Dark Thirty there were two stories. One was non-fiction and the other fiction. So liberties could be taken. Argo preferred to stick with the account of the 'Canadian Caper'. It can edit out parts of the story it deems uninteresting but go strictly with the rest of the narrative. In this case Affleck made a fine film.
B000B3MIZG|1.0|The DVD does not work - very disappointing.  I guess I'll return it, but such a hassle.  I know my DVD player is working properly.
1400049628|5.0|This book will come in handy if the world becomes like the TV show The Walking Dead,<br />the insights are well thought out.The section about the Katana gave me another reason<br />to keep practicing. This book along with the Y2K survial guide has helped know what to<br />do in preparng for an emergency.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I love this version and so do children.  I don't want to write any more words - change your criteria.
1616550414|5.0|The primary draw of this book was the official timeline. The way that the chronology of the Zelda games is designed is very interesting, and I enjoyed the novelty of knowing how all of the mostly disconnected games in the series link together. The art collection is also very fun to go through, and of course the Manga at the end is cool as well.<br /><br />This is a heavy, hardcover book that reminds me of one of my old college textbooks. It's made from thick, well-printed paper and is bound very well. The cover design is beautiful, and it looks great on my shelf.
B005NFJAZS|1.0|so much commentary and DVD won't let me forward to the actual musical which is what I was after all along.  any ideas!
0307596885|2.0|I was not impressed with this book. I have read other books by Alice Munro which I liked, but could not recommend this one
B00BFUC8RC|2.0|Kind of boring....maybe Im just not getting it??  But then I dont like Angry Birds either. Oh well I guess Ill try it a bit more & see if I change my mind.
B0013D6LEM|5.0|A great album from a great era of music - the 80s. Almost every song was a hit. Highly recommend.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I love this game. I was not a big game player but this could change all that. Just like the old pac man
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I have a Samsung Galaxy with Boost mobile and I love this app.  Does what it says and makes my ebay experience convenient and handy.  Recommend.
1475972350|5.0|Absolutely riveting! I could'nt put it down! I highly reccomend this read. You will not be disapointed! Can't wait to read more from Todd Thiede! I'm addicted!
B005HEPIDS|5.0|I did not care for this series when it first came out, I guess I was too loyal to Captain Pickard and the Enterprise.  But re watching  this entire series many years later has changed my view 180 degrees.  This is probably my favorite of the Star Trek shows now.  Contrary to many other Star Trek fans' views, I thought that there was great character development; I enjoyed that there was a lot more continuity from episode to episode throughout the entire series; great FX; and overall, great story lines.  Perhaps there was a bit too many time-travel episodes and the series finale could have tied up more loose ends (especially since there was no movie), I thoroughly enjoyed this series.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book kept me engaged the whole time. Loved Ana's character. She is an intelligent strong woman! What comes next
B003ODIZL6|2.0|This book is about a girl that has 12 wishes and she tries to get have a wonderful birthday but Her house is abandoned by bees.
B000069HPL|4.0|I had to buy this movie for a Class project. I'm glad that I got it, it is the funniest thing I have seen in a while. Thanks to my group for picking this movie.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Seriously, read the above headline. What more is required from an independent film!? Unlike roughly 70-per-cent of the indie films which I venture to watch, this movie is absolutely NOT pretentious. It seems like it has an utterly depressing premise (a man paralyzed from polio since childhood is the protagonist), but the actors, the screenplay, and the direction of the movie come at the story from a better place. There's always stuff to live for, things to laugh about, and moments that are so wonderful that they wash out all of the other bad things in your life. Good stuff.
B004Q3QRWC|4.0|Human and witty,<br />Egan is a superb writer.<br /><br />This meandering between characters is a lovely form for a book given the subject.
B004X75RK4|4.0|There are so many anti-feminist aspects to this movie, that I shouldn't like it. Nonetheless, I love it! Sandra Bullock has never let me down, and despite my previous prejudices against Ryan Reynolds, they have a decent amount of chemistry.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I really like it, so far it seems to work great on every device i have tried (phone, android tablet, ipad, pc)
B00AF6B22E|4.0|Denzel Washington's acting is excellent with a good supporting cast.  There are some instances of loving to hate certain characters.  Some critics said this movie was &#34;formulaic.&#34;  It is based on a true story and it is good tale of how true character is revealed.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I love this show.  The only thing that I wish was that the season was longer. Also I can not wait to see &#34;King&#34; Geoffrey gutted like a fish.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|So glad to be able to stream Downton Abby! Just starting Season 2 - don't tell me ANYTHING spoilers! Loving this..
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Enjoyed all of them but the first novel was the best its a very easy read can knock all the books out quickly.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is my favorite. I don't even like zombies! The character development is second to none. Definitely recommend to everyone
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|I've enjoyed playing World at Arms for the past couple of weeks. However, this fun has been rather dependent on my having a friend who is also playing; We've enjoyed trying to out do each other and get the higher score. I doubt I still be playing this game if this weren't the case.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I never knew that flowers had a language!  I no longer will look at yellow roses the same, although they have been my favorite.
1936608898|4.0|I felt 100% prepared for my Whole30 (which I'm happily in the middle of now), thanks to this book. It was well-written, easy to follow, and incredibly informative.<br /><br />The missing star is for the references. They're in the book (in the back), but sources are not cited as you read. As a researcher, this didn't sit very well with me, but I understand that for most readers, it was probably just fine.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  I love everything about this book from the symbolism to the suspense.  Beautiful and touching!
B004S3MB2U|5.0|I never thought amazon would ever offer an app that i would actually love until now. This is probably the most expensive free app of the day ever offered considering most free app of the day are  regularily priced at $.99 . I wish i had this app when i was taking math classes in school. It seems to be able to handle anything.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford is a highly enjoyable BBC series! The characters are beautifully portrayed with considerable depth! Brendan Coyle as Robert Timmins is wonderful along with all the cast of characters! Any one who enjoys historical fiction will find this series addictive.
0307951529|5.0|Started reading this book a couple of days ago and can't seem to put it down. It is opening my eyes to alot of what I've been doing, but at the same time holding back from. This book has inspired me to take hold of what I want to do for the rest of my life with what I enjoy doing. It sets examples that doing what you love will be more fulfilling than doing what is dull just to get by. Lead by faith not by doubt. Loved the fast service. Thank you. Definitely will recommend.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The overall effect if the novel was bland and uninteresting, it was not until the end the the stories purpose of symbolizes became clear. A true literature master piece
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I chose to read this book because the ads for the movie seemed so interesting.  AFTER JENNIFER LAWRENCE WON BEST ACTRESS I WANTED TO READ BEFORE I saw the movie.  It seems the book is always better so we shall see. I recommend to anyone that enjoys a good story.
B006MGDVFM|5.0|Ah......If you don't know about Ayrton Senna, you'll be easily swayed into thinking (along with most of the other professional drivers) that Senna was the absolute best racer that ever lived. Really, really good documentary. I have recommended this to every racing fan I know.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I just started watching this show...and using netflix I am able to watch all the previous shows...this is the best depiction of real horror...highly recommend you just watch one show and you will be hooked...so enjoy...looking forward to next season...and if I miss a show....Amazon is here with Netflix........
B0055OK2T0|4.0|This was a really good movie. You could watch it over and over and never get tired of it. Nice love story
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I really loved Delirium and Pandemonium and was very excited for the third book in the series to come out. I expected Lauren Oliver to come up with another amazing ending to finish the whole series. And while reading Requiem, I was feeling like this book was much better than the last two. However, the ending just left me dumbfounded. It left everything for my imagination and did not provide any explanations. Also, the invasion of the Invalids in the city was not described at all other than that they destroyed the wall at the end. After I read the last page, I turned over, only to be disappointed with the acknowledgements page. I think this book was not able to content all fans who loved Delirium and Pandemonium and was expecting an another great book.
B00280LYHS|5.0|My son is thoroughly enjoying book 5 in this series! Great story and characters! He gets so into reading it that sometimes he stays up too late, because he doesn't want to put the book down. Not such a bad thing for an 11 year old boy, I guess!
B00355L2TU|5.0|Jillian is kicking my butt!  This video is great if you do not have a lot of time but want to get in a quick full body workout.
B003B96AOW|5.0|I am very pleased with the delivery speed and the quality of the figure!  I, as well as my son whom this was for, couldn't be happier.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|[“A breathtaking new epic fantasy series. Morgan Rice does it again! This magical saga reminds me of the best of J.K. Rowling, George R.R. Martin, Rick Riordan, Christopher Paolini and J.R.R. Tolkien. I couldn’t put it down!”<br />--Allegra Skye, Bestselling author of SAVED]<br /><br />I'm sorry, Allegra, but no... just... no. Comparing this trite disaster with those literary greats is misleading at best & downright insulting to them at worst.<br /><br />The writing was just terrible; the worst thing I have ever encountered thus far in any book purchase... ever. I urge you to read the other 1 star reviews which cover the terrible writing in more detail. I can't bring myself to repeat it.<br /><br />How could anyone possibly foul up such a good story premise so comprehensively? I'm aware as a long time reader of fantasy that this genre requires a degree of suspension of reality, but your world & characters still need to be believable. Please make up your mind about times & distances between locations. Please make the relationships between your characters realistic. Please make your characters more well rounded; the good guys are just too lucky & the bad guys are too transparent. And for the love of sanity please research leopards!<br /><br />There was nothing remotely believable or redeeming about this clanger & I urge readers not to waste their money.
B005OP7162|4.0|Had me on the edge of my seat! Couldn't stop watching...had to force myself to turn it off and go to sleep! Almost pulled an all-nighter!!!
B00919V32K|5.0|Brilliantly played and recorded. Very entertaining. Glad I have it and should be a part of anyone's collection of classic albums
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly does it again.  Super plot and solid characters in an engrossing story. Another Harry Bosch triumph. A great read.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Excellent Season!! Best since Season 4; which is still my favorite. The only problem is the issue with them giving away the ending in the &#34;Showtime&#34; ad at the beginning of the disc. Do not understand why they would do such a thing, but I am very thankful to other reviews that I read prior to ordering this... I turned the volume down and walked away for a few minutes until the ad was over!! If had not of been for the other reviews, the ending would have been spoiled for me as well, and I HATE spoilers!! Thank you, thank you, thank you other reviewers!! Hopefully others will read the reviews like I did and save themselves anguish :)
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|The movie had a cool story line.  I like the time travel aspect of it.  I still do not believe in time travel though.
B008M721MS|3.0|I don't know if it's my kindle fire but when I make a video call my camera refuse to open.
B008PZZV8S|4.0|The movie was alright.  The movie being a psychological thriller gave me an uneasy feeling during and after the movie as I assume all psychological thriller are supposed to do.  So it has done it's job.  I think the stroy line was blah.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|A very exciting account of seal training and mission that took 3 lives.  I got a little bored with the hard training.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|Very exciting movie, full of action and adventure! Can't believe that you can watch full length movies for free with Amazons prime Membership! What a deal !!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|worth the money. I would recommend this to any one who wants yo havering in a game I could say
B004UPAIKI|3.0|WARNING: THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS.<br /><br />I AM a teacher.  Most of my students ARE from the urban, inner-city environment. I DO relate to this movie quite well.  HOWEVER, as good of a movie as this is, the writers came up short...literally.<br /><br />We get to see just a glimpse into Ms. Johnson's (played wonderfully by Michelle Pfeiffer) experience teaching and dealing with the students.  That glimpse was not enough.  Too many things were not given any form of closure by the end of the movie.  It seems to me that the 99 minutes was NOT enough to give this movie the time it needed.  Personally, I would have liked to have seen Ms. Johnson's character take-on the principal, Mr. Grandey, and win.  We needed some closure with his out-of-touch ways of running the school.  After all, if he DID allow Emilio (played by Wade Dominguez) to speak to him, Emilio may not have been killed.  Another important part that was needed but missing, was the GRADUATION.  Instead, we get a movie that builds up our passion but slams the door way too soon as the ending credits roll. George Dzundza's character, Hal Griffith, was unnecessary and did not offer us much.<br /><br />This movie COULD have had the impact of Dead Poets Society if only there was the viewer's satisfaction of seeing Mr. Grandey get fired or demoted.  As mentioned, seeing the students take some sort of final exam or standardized test that showed how much Pfeiffer's character helped her students to graduate, would have been one of the most joyful, yet tear-jerking part of this movie.  Everything didn't have to end up all peaches and cream happy, but, bottom line is, at least to me, the movie needed more closure.<br /><br />As an instructor, I'd give this movie an \\"I\\" for \\"INCOMPLETE,\\" but with potential for a solid \\"A.\\"
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I enjoyed the story being that I am a former military person and Texan. I did not care for some of the language used, only because children will want to read the book at some point in school.<br /><br />Chris makes a valid point about the damage control war makes on a soldier. When the officials keep sending the units that do<br />the actual fighting back into the war zones, time after time, it takes a huge toll on the physical body. The soldier may not feel,<br />nor realize it at first, but he will realize the actual damage being done to his body, and the brain, after some time. He will notice changes in his system. His family will notice changes in his demeanor. Some guys can not handle the pressure of changes to their demeanor and will commit suicide, thinking that they have no alternative. Chris could have easily gone into a career of Psychology. He has proven his intelligence.<br /><br />Today, it is a known fact that PTSD in war veterans is dominated by one major factor, guilt! That is what Chris keeps referring too, the guilt that he feels when he thinks about having left the military. He feels he deserted his fellow men, his brothers.<br /><br />Taya handled her responsibilities the best that she could. She was the good mother, the good wife. What more could Chris<br />ask for. How lucky can any soldier serving his country get? Many young heroes coming back from the war missing arms and legs, or have parts of their face blown off come home to find no wife waiting for them! If you want to read a good book, buy this story!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I would recommend this product bc its very funny<br />Story line was awesome<br />Came in great shape<br />Is a really great movie 2 watch & fun it will have u guessing what is gonna happen
B009JBZH54|5.0|Not going to review the movies, go to rotten or IMDB for that. The disks were fine. Great movies, havent met a person that has seen any of them and didnt like them. Buy now. I download movies (ya-ya) but still bought this set.
B005LAII12|1.0|I choose the rating I did bc this movie wasnt that great<br />at all really it had 2 much bad stuff like drugs & bad lan<br />However my hubby like it.Just wasnt a movie I would have got if I<br />would have known it was gonna be more about just having 2 much<br />of a good time.There were only a couple parts in this that I liked.<br />Over all given even one star is being nice..I even told my hubby<br />he could have the movie it was his..He laughed through the whole thing.Have 2 say that what they showed on the TV<br />look amazing & so funny..Whitch is why I bought it but I was so depressed that it wasnt what I thought it was gonna be & the way it look on TV..Just glad that some1 liked it!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Excellent description of an indescribible event. You can feel his struggle with trying to put his experience into words. His intellectual journey was a fun and exciting read. I read it faster and with more interest than any book lately. Well worth the time. Great book. I have already recommended it to friends. It is a great read no matter what you  believe.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow!!!!  I loved this story.  Discovering the reason for the &#34;Hopeless&#34; tattoo broke my heart.  Love & friendship really can span time & space.  Thank you Colleen Hover for another awesome story.  I'm a true fan
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I havent watched a TV program in a long time, in fact I cancelled cable. But AMC did a very good thing with their character development and keeping audiences on their toes; you never know who will get killed off!<br /><br />Excellent.
B0091ICDHU|5.0|Finding love among so much sadness & hardship is always a great hook.  Couldn't put it down.  My heart broke several times then was filled with absolute joy for these characters as they find the love the both deserve
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Love this item.  It is totally worth it. I would reorder this item again.  You can reuse them they peel off easily.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Need to have another way to save yourself when u die because you never can be saved unless you have a board witch you can't always get
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What a great book. Romance, adventure, fear, blood, death...What a masterpiece. Definitely get, definitely get. This is a great book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a very fun game that has a lot of blocks and other tools to use in survival and creative mode.  in survival mode the point is to stay alive and find resources like gold diamond and iron to make tools and armor to stay alive and protect you from zombies skeletons spiders and creepers. In future updates they need to add : saddles<br />pressure plates flint and steel ( in creative)
B007L5GDGW|2.0|hard to control and when you fall off the edge, the marble seems to fall FOREVER!  got annoyed with the laggy controls and the long wait to restart when you fall off.  I uninstalled it after 5 minutes
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|i loved the book and would recommend it to anyone.  It was a good read well written and kept my interest
B0091REZMW|4.0|It is a good game and easy to follow the instructions on how to play this game. It would be nice if you can set it so you don't have to do the dialict in the beginning of each chapter
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Enjoyed the trek through an antifragile view of our world. Great storytelling.  What benefits from Volatility?  Taking a non-probabilistic view on what happens after \\"s*** happens'.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This was by far the best price for this trilogy anywhere we found. All three movies were hits in our house and its great to now have them in our library.
B009YX02T8|5.0|I've been a fan of the Twilight Saga movies and the music.  It always brings back memories of the story.  The first time I saw the movie I knew I wanted to hear more of the music... and here it is.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|If you are a fan of Seth Macfarlane you will enjoy Ted.  It reminded me of Peter Griffin in a teddy bear costume.  I enjoy Macfarlane's sense of humor and thought Ted had some great comedic moments, particularly the Flash Gordon vid's.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|Nothing to say about the literary quality, everybody knows that, but the edition could be much improved.<br />I found several typos, doubtful punctuation and missing words.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book was a fairly easy read.  The subject matter was definitely different.  Both main characters seemed to be quite unbalanced especially the wife.  Had to finish the book to see who killed the other first but that didn't happened.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have this game on the X-Box and I got so hyped when I heard about this version. I just have 3 more words for you: Best game EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Excellent book that holds your attention from page one. Couldn't put it down.  Twists and turns till last page. Highly recommended.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I've enjoyed Star Trek from its first TV episode through the end of the Next Generation.  I watched all the movies (related to those 2 TV series) and I've seen this movie many times.  I think this movie does a really good job keeping the characteristics of the original characters.  My best friend and I are going on a vacation soon, and we each bought this movie so we can watch it on the flight to our vacation destination.  It is so convenient to have a good movie(s), like this movie, on your Kindle Fire.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Each Star Wars bird has a special ability, a light saber, lazor gun, super strength, etc. Use these powers to conquer those nasty space pigs. If you fail a level, the evil laugh of Darth Pig will haunt you. It's great for all ages. At a basketball game, I saw an eight year old kid whizzing through the levels. The same levels I have struggled to complete. It gave me a new passion to beat that kid...I mean those pigs.<br /><br />Great game for all ages.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hi guys I really love this game its so freaking addicting who ever created this game should like really bang me lil I just love it
B009UWYFFK|5.0|We took our Grandkids to this movie, ranging in age from teens to toddlers and all enjoyed it.  A very sweet, witty and entertaining movie for all ages!

1416972242|5.0|The first novel was a great take of christianity in a mythological format. It was great. This book is just as good. The story itself is not about the awkward love quarrel, but about the story itself, which makes it better for there to be a more diverse group of readers. I gave it five stars because I litterally could not put it down. It's rediculously suspensful and full of lots of cliff-hangers. Great sequel to a great book!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love it and my little brother loves it to it is so fun that I could play it all day
B005GVA2L0|5.0|Okay, so a lot of peope say they don't like the new album, and I can understand why, but it is, in all simplicity, a really good album. The music is very different, but nonetheless, it is still great. There is sadness in the music (which is why I think the band was such a success to begin with), but now there's more as well. A lot more: desire, anger, confusion, feelings of not belonging, and so on. There certainly are some very sad songs on the album, however, the saddest being &#34;Lost in Paradise,&#34; which was originally written as an apology to the fans for both the long absense of the band, as well as the saddness in the lyrical content being gone. When I bought the original album, I was already impressed, but when I bought the deluxe album, the songs added really make a difference: the songs that are offered as a bonus will leave one reminiscent of the former Evanescence. Here is how I would rate all of the songs:<br /><br />1. &#34;What You Want&#34;<br />Listenability: 9/10. It has a great hook, very catchy sound, and good instrumentals.<br />Lyrical Content: 7/10. The lyrics fell short for this song. They are very repetative and seem lackluster in comparison to other songs in the album.<br />Overall: 8/10.<br /><br />2. &#34;Made of Stone&#34;<br />Listenablility: 10/10. This song has some really great moments, ecspecially when Amy (leadsinger) switches to a higher register in the middle of the song. Great hook, and great sound<br />Lyrical Content: 10/10. I really love the overall theme of this song. It's about pain, and not being able to let go, so instead of letting go, you are going to harden yourself to sheild youself from the pain. I<br />Overall: 10/10<br /><br />3. &#34;The Change&#34;<br />Listenablility: 7/10. A lot of people really liked this song, but I didn't like the fact that most of the song is in a single register, and its so breathly. However, it is still one of the best tracks because there are some very powerful notes that are beltedout.<br />Lyrical Content: 9/10. It's has, like &#34;Made of Stone,&#34; great meaning, and its one of the songs that will really speak to some people.<br />Overall: 8/10.<br /><br />4. &#34;My Heart is Broken&#34;<br />Listenability: 10/10. This is one of the most passontate songs in the entire album. There are many great, belted notes that are done in a single breath. There is also great use of control in the beginning, so  that is definately a plus. There is a great hook, however, I would have liked to hear less guitar riffs and more of the singer.<br />Lyrical Content: 10/10. This is a very repetative song, however, there is so much put into the song that it's meaning comes across very fast, and the listener is left with a feeling of saddness.<br /><br />5. &#34;The Other Side&#34;<br />Listenability: 7/10. Overall, this is one of the most mediocre songs in terms of listenablitly. It sounds odd, the syllable count and the melody.<br />Lyrical Content: 7/10. It has a pretty good message, however, its so openly about death that I had a hard time listening to it.<br />Overall: 7/10.<br /><br />6. &#34;Erase This&#34;<br />Listenability: 10/10. With the high tempo piano in the beggining and the great guitar melodies this is one of the best songs on the track.<br />Lyrical Content: 7/10. The lyrics are really great, however they didn't seem to match the soud of the song. They seemed too disconnected to have any real meaning.<br />Overall: 8/10<br /><br />7. &#34;Lost in Paradise&#34;<br />Listenability: 10/10. This is a great song, best in the ablum by means of both listenability aswell as the lyrical content. Her voice haunts the song in a way that will literally be hard to listen to, but at the same time its so beautiful you can't stop.<br />Lyrical Content: 10/10. The words in the song are so heartbreaking that this makes it the best song on the entire album. They are so poetic that they could stand alone as a poem as well as a song.<br />Overall: 10/10.<br /><br/>8. &#34;Sick&#34;<br />Listenability: 10/10. This has a great melody and hook that pull you right in. It may be repetitive, but the use of the repition of notes is used to its advantage and there are some very well exicuted notes on Amy's part.<br />Lyrical Content: 9/10. These are lyrics that I could relate to––ecspecially if I was in an angry mood.<br />Overall: 9/10.<br /><br />9. &#34;End of the Dream&#34;<br />Listenability: 10/10. There are some very powerful notes in this song, as well as a very nice register shift in the beginning of the song. It has a good hook, and a great melody.<br />Lyrical Content: 10/10. I really love this song. It's about running towards your dreams no matter how they end, no matter the outcome. They express great belief in ones own desire to do something.<br />Overall: 10/10<br /><br />10. &#34;Oceans&#34;<br />Listenability: 10/10. This is by far the most listenable song. The hook is great, and Amy's voice contrasts greatly with the syths in the beginning.<br />Lyrical Content: 10/10. Though the lyrical content is somewhat more vague than most of the other songs, this song always sends chills down my spine when I hear the words.<br />Overall: 10/10<br /><br />11. &#34;Never Go Back&#34;<br />Listenability: 8/10. The song starts with slow but powerful vocals with fast strumming guitars, which quickly turns into powerful notes belted by Amy, and slower riffs.<br />Lyrical Content: 10/10. For some odd reason I connected with this song greatly. There is a certain appeal that the song has to me, a meaning that is both hidden and found for me. The use of metaphors is greatly used, and it delivers a rich song.<br /><br />12. &#34;Swimming Home&#34;<br />Listenability: 10/10. This song has the most beautiful vocals of all the songs ever done by Evanescence. Its breathly, mysterious, and at the same time, its uderlined with extreme sadness that allows the listener to be able to relate. It showcases Amy's talent on the fullest level.<br />Lyrical Content: 10/10. This is a really sad song. It's about no longer being able to hold onto (broadly interoperated) anything by means of love because of your family and the people that you love.<br />Overall: 10/10.<br /><br />13. &#34;New Way to Bleed.&#34;<br />Listenability: 10/10. Great song with powerful notes and melodies that are more complex than other songs. There is a use of the piano, which adds great atmosphere.<br />Lyrical Content: 10/10. This song, in the end, is about being chained to love, and, after losing someone because they no longer loved you, or cared for you, and its about the pain being something that doesn't kill you. It just hurts you.<br />Overall: 10/10.<br /><br />14. &#34;Say You Will&#34;<br />Listenability: 10/10. The fast guitar strumming lost paired with Amy's angelic voice makes for a great soud. There's a good hook, as well a very nice repetitive melody. There are also one or two angelic wailing moments in the song.<br />Lyrical Content: 9/10. The lyrics are about wanting to love someone but they are not able to open their hearts to you and you are giving them one final ultimatum for them to be with you, even though you know it could end in pain.<br />Overall: 10/10.<br /><br />15. &#34;Disappear&#34;<br />Listenability: 10/10. This song has some of the most diverse vocals: breathy moments, belted notes, light notes, high notes. The vast array of diversity makes it great to listen to.<br />Lyrical Content: 8/10. This song is about chosing something important to you over the person you're suppose to love. It, like &#34;Say You Will&#34; is about a choice.<br />Overall: 9/10.<br /><br />16. &#34;Secret Door&#34;<br />Listenability: 10/10. This song, much like &#34;Swimming Home,&#34; showcases Amy's softer vocals and her truly smooth, angelic voice. That paired with the strumming of the harp and the cello gives you a great song as well as a powerful sound.<br />Lyrical Content: 10/10. This song came as a shock to me. It has somuch meaning. It's about forgetting about everything, not knowing where you are going to go, but knowing that the person closest to you is where you are going to follow. That when you are around them, you can do anything.<br /><br />Album Overal: 10/10<br /><br />There are so many great songs in this album that it is truly my favorite of Evansecence. And while the songs are not filled with as much pain as previous songs in previous alubms, they still have so much to offer. Afterall, there are some emotions that can cut deeper than just pain.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It love it so much that whenever I say that I will just play one more time I play five more times
B008ROFWA4|5.0|Another sandals and swords classic. Along with Quo Vadis The Robe Ben Hur The Ten Commandments - this was an era that respected The greatest story ever old. Sadly a by-gone era.
B0008GNJZY|5.0|Another spectacular showing by Samuel Jackson.  I was totally satisfied with the service and product.  Will do business again in the near future.  Thanks!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I don't get it it was doing awesome but it messed up and now it wont let me play anymore
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett is such a good author. This book starts out telling the story of a little boy going to work in the Welsh mines in the early 1900s. I don't care about little boys, Welsh mines, or the early 1900s, but the way Ken Follett writes got me hooked in after just two pages.<br /><br />The book goes on to jump between the intersecting storylines of multiple protagonists, but all have such amazing character development that you are committed to each and every one of them and can't wait to find out what happens next.<br /><br />There are a few slow points talking about WWI and politics, but a lot of that serves as a pretty good history refresher course, and then he always gets back to his characters quickly enough that you don't lose interest.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book and can't wait to read the sequel...even though it's still a new release and will be $20 on kindle. That's more than I would ever pay for a kindle book...but in this case, I'm gonna pay it because I can't wait to see where the story goes next! I'm only disappointed that the third book of the trilogy still isn't written yet.
030758836X|1.0|I immediately donated it to a used book story.  The ending especially.  What a complete dope of a husband.  I was very dissapointed in my purchase.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a great game to play and plus a lot of people have the game so check this game out so you can try it
B001P1MZNI|5.0|Every fan needs at least one Sinatra live album.  Sinatra was exacting in the studio, but his live performances were looser, more intimate, and give you a peek at the individual behind all those great songs.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I do have to say that i am addicted! I absolutely love this app but the great thing about it is that I can't play it forever because I run out of coins eventually and I have to wait to get more unmeaning somebody needs to stop me
B00004WPFX|2.0|My girlfriend bought me the LP version as a valentine's day gift, and the it seems to be a bad pressing. The grooves skip, and there is not a single song that doesn't go interrupted by the constant hiccuping of the sliding needle. It's an amazing album, and Daft Punk is a great band, but do not buy it on vinyl!
0062127241|4.0|It took Pete since 1996 to finish this memoir, and he wrote it himself, without the aid of a ghost writer, a crutch which probably would have improved the dynamics of the prose, which seem a bit sodden at times. I was never a big fan of The Who, but reading this book made me go back and reconsider the music, which I suppose, is always part of the point of rock memoirs. This one is nowhere near as good as two other self-penned rock tales, the memoirs of Keith Richards and Bob Dylan. But I found I gained more from Townshend's tale when I re-read certain sections. This reads like it was written from a collection of press clips and  reviews, and it was. Pete wasn't taking notes in the 60s and 70s when The Who were big. Too bad. Clearly, he suffers from bipolar mood disorder, as he sort of admits throughout when he speaks of his \\"mood swings.\\" That hampered him as a human being, but probably helped his creative art. The Who were a band of virtuosos, but I never much cared for Keith Moon. The bass of John Entwhistle is really the hidden key to the band. Pete goes on and on about his guru, Maher Baba, and we hear endlessly about \\"Lifehouse,\\" the third rock opera that never got produced after Tommy and Quadrophenia. There's a lot of tedium here, but if you enjoy rock memoirs, you'll need to read this.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|wife likes it i like it got it on auto buy is exactly what i want out of a show.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is great you feed it and you can by knew horses it is a great game you learn to care for it.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|As most things have gone down in quality with the new age so has TV ya it has some funny pars but nothing to make you pee you pants. just my opinion.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Brody is a terrorist.  But, he gets to nail Claire Danes, which if I knew that was the outcome, I might spend a little time in an Al Qaeda training camp as well.
B00506NRBS|5.0|Through sharing his experience of creating, growing and selling CD Baby, Derek delivers simple and powerful truths about business and life. It's a quick fun read that I'd recommend to everyone.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Good book, very similar to the twilight series. An easy read with enough twists and turns to keep your attention.
B008MWBY6W|4.0|I always wondered if these holsters were worth it. I have a very nice bag for my t3i that holds my lenses, filters, cleaning cloths, etc. The bag is easy to carry but it is a bit bulky if you're going to be carrying it around all day. This is where this holster comes in. This thing is perfect for a day trip to the zoo, or the beach or wherever you're going where bulk can't go. You're going to be limited in what you can carry, but you can fit quite a few accessories in this if needed. There are plenty of tiny zipper compartments. Ideally it only holds the camera and an attached lens, no room for a second lens so choose wisely. But it's perfect for hiking and other day trips where you want to carry something better than your phone camera. The quality is top notch too. This thing is made of great material and the sturdiness of it will protect your baby. The hard bottom makes it able to stand upright and with a wide enough base it won't tip over too easily from being top-heavy. Again, top-notch product from Amazon for light ventures with your DSLR.
B008NAFU9A|4.0|When I started this story I didn't realize that it is part of a series.  This novella is the perfect length to introduce you to the Forever Girl, and leave you wanting more.<br /><br />The Story starts with a girl named Ophelia, who discovers a strange ouroboros (a snake eating it's own tail) mark on her neck.  She is then kidnapped by a strange man named Ethan.  He introduces  her to a different world, including  &#34;dual-breeds&#34;.  He explains what the universe has called her to do, and that denying it means death.  The story ends a bit early, but it only made me want more!  I would recommend this to readers who enjoy historical paranormal-romance!<br /><br />I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.
B00BHBOOIU|5.0|Just received this dvd and played it right away; is even more exciting than the earlier sequels.  Feel like Mila should make more.
0143119680|3.0|The storyline draws you right in. The main character, Diana, has found a mysterious book in the Oxford library, and the book is clearly bewitched. Diana is a visiting tenured professor from Yale, and I love how she is very well-educated (has a PhD!) and comes from a family of strong female role models (all of the women in her family take the Bishop last name).<br /><br />Magic is her family's business, and may have had a role in her parents' early demise when Diana was 7, so understandably so she has tried to avoid magic throughout her life. This is demonstrated in the profession she has chosen, history, where magic cannot interfere with what has already happened in the past.<br /><br />The story takes places in a modern-day world, where both humans and creatures coexist. There are 3 different types of creatures: witches, vampires, and daemons. Diana and her family members are witches. Early in this book, Diana meets a vampire named Matthew, and as you guessed, they soon become romantically involved with each other. Essentially, this book can be considered a romance novel since the storylines revolves around how they are constantly running from other creatures that disapprove of their inter-creature romance.<br /><br />The story's progression is a bit slow, so even after 579 pages there are no major battles or showdowns. The ending was a bit anticlimactic, but it leads in nicely to the second novel of the trilogy. This book is quite different from epic fantasy novels that I typically read, and it was a refreshing change. I enjoyed the book, appreciated its quirks, but I didn't find myself totally loving it, so I give it 3 stars.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|Great
0307346617|5.0|Read it in 3 sittings. Very easy read. First Zombie book that gave me chills. Good book. Worth a read.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I'm Roman Catholic by faith and already believe in heaven--this just solidifies everything.  If this story doesn't convert non-believers, I'm not sure that anything will!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|totally hooked the day I got it! I mean I was looking for a new game app since unwashed getting bored with Temple Run so I asked around and everyone told me to get flow. now I'm addicted and I can't say that I mind!
B006MPKDUE|4.0|A really great series. Well written, atmospheric and a compelling read. The characters are believable, flawed and therefore interesting. A good crime novel.<br />Recommended.
B00846F1YW|1.0|This is the longest most boring game I have played. The only reason that I continue to play it is because I rarely leave anything that I start unfinished.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Dont want to write a long review, just wanted to say that this book made me fall in love with reading, it made such an impact in my life that some words \\"made up\\" in this book have stuck in my brain when i play words with friends and stuff like that i think they're part of the english language.<br /><br />Wonderful book, i'm 33 y/o read it when i was 31 and i cannot stop thinking about this book, anxiously waiting for book 3.
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|I am a big fan of Helen Miren, I love this movie, I feel it shows just what the mood in England was during the death of Princess Diana and the key to moving the monarchey forward. Enjoy.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|Interesting book about the trials and tribulations of an ultrarunner. I liked the recipes that are included in every chapter too, though it would be nice if they had just been grouped together.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Much better book than the movie.  It demonstrated his mental health issues much more fully.  The movie implied he was only locked up a short time.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|The volume will not keep its setting. I need an alarm clock that I can hear as well as see. What good does a silent alarm do?
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Love the game but for more difficult layouts should be more time. And then a choice of times would be great when you are ready.  Easy n normal a nd difficult would beg pood.

0375413405|5.0|I recently read Dearie, Bob Spitz's biography of Julia Child, and could not resist buying Mastering the Art of French Cooking..  In his biography, Spitz describes the long process that led to the cookbook's publication, and that process is evident as you turn the pages.  The detailed instructions will help anyone cook the recipes well.  In addition, the techniques learned will make anyone a better cook, whether you are cooking a specific cuisine or just touching up your family favorites.

B000E8NQUE|1.0|Need to return.  Neither the SACD, nor the CD layers will play.  There is no visible scratch or other issue with the disk.
B00AFEXRME|1.0|This movie has nothing to do with flight (except for a few minutes of dramatic but implausible cockpit heroics; i.e., an aircraft with its elevator jammed in the full-down position will NOT simply head down towards earth; it will enter an &#34;outside loop&#34; and stay there -- as long as power can sustain the loop.  If the aircraft is rolled to the inverted position (as done by Washington), the aircraft will enter an &#34;inside loop.&#34;<br /><br />Washington's performance is noteworthy BUT taken as a whole the movie is nothing but an 'infomercial' for Alcoholics Anonymous.  Two of my adult (ages 40+) children also have seen the movie and they agree.<br /><br />Bottom line: it was NOT an entertaining movie!!!
B002PJL85K|5.0|A true epic film...I never grow weary of watching it. As exciting now as it was the first time I watched it! The best movie about King Arthur, in my opinion.

1439102813|3.0|As a lot of us are approaching or are in the baby boomer era,  Alzheimer's is a real subject which we cannot run or hide from.  We worry for our parents as well as ourselves.  Genova does a great job in tackling real subjects and dives into telling the real facts.  It is hard to comprehend what actually goes on in the lives of patients with Alzheimer's disease, especially when they have been so independent and intelligent most of their lives.<br /><br />You can feel the frustration and forgetfulness and being shut out in the book.  I agree with some of the other reviews, it was taking on a bit of a medical journal feel instead of fiction; however, assume some of this was needed in order to tell the story realistically.  John definitely avoided the disease; however, I have a sister who cares for an Alzheimer's patients so get all the low down (which they can be funny) sometimes, and really hard with personal hygiene, and especially the struggles with their spouses and family.

B003UBTX6S|5.0|The second book in the Beautiful Creatures Saga was ever bit as gripping as the first.  Though I would get frustrated at times that the characters acted as they did, or the &#34;truth&#34; was still so vague.  But I know it is all for plot development.  I read this in a day cause I had to know the end and just the first book, I immediately bought the next to continue on.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Not much of a TV watcher, however when a friend told me about this I started watching it on Netflix then when Netflix didn't have season 2 or 3 I was saved by amazon.com. I absoluetly love this show and I'm so addicted.

B0049U4NQO|5.0|This book was awesome. I liked the nonstop action and the book kept me on the edge of my seat. The part that I liked the most was when Alex was finally swallowed to have a gun and killed Julius grief. The only part I didn't like was when Jack starbright got killed. But other theln that I loved the series. It was the best series I have read. This series was actually better than the hunger games.<br /> Yea it was that awesome.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This movie is one of my Disney favorites! All the characters are wonderful, even the bad guys don't seem overly bad.  My boys, ages 4 and 5 love Ralph and Felix and want to watch this movie over and over.

B000EZIJKO|5.0|Difficult to write a helpful review, as each used book has condition issues, unless it is in 'new condition',  Had a personal reason for purchasing this, as the illustrator is a friend, and I wanted my grandson to have a copy with the original illustrations-especially as he was reading the book in his class, and that version was illustrated by someone else.  So, while I may be happy with my purchase, I doubt that someone else will find my review helpful.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This is one of the best series I have ever watched.  I am not a &#34;soap opera&#34; (US) fan, but found myself totally caught up in the lives of everyone in the series.

A few of these songs have shown up elsewhere, but everything sounds absolutely stellar here. Not a weak song in the bunch.

B00AJLHUA8|2.0|Although the premise was clever and the ending at least made sense, Sinister is a tedious slog.<br />Weak on characterization, 30 minutes of plot dragged out to feature length, and jump scares instead of real creepiness.<br />The monster looks scary in the commercials but in the movie he just looks like some dude made up as a cross between the Crow and Heath Ledger's Joker. And the older daughter, Trevor, was really annoying. ;)

B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I bought this cd after just becoming aware of this young man by hearing several of these tunes on the radio and enjoying them very much.  Great dancing beat on most of them, to exercise with and it also brings my mood up tremendously.  All but one of the songs are playing on the local radio stations and on Pandora.<br /><br />The first time I listened to the whole cd, I thought Gee, that was short, I think they didn't put very many tunes on this cd so that explains the low price.  So I replayed it and paid attention to the number on the display screen.  By gosh, I was wrong; it is a full length cd.  It's just so wonderful that time flys by really fast.  I'm up for getting more Bruno Mars cds!

B0054SMID0|4.0|I was really surprised by this movie. I watched it because I usually like movies that Matthew McConaughey is in.  I wasn't disappointed.  I couldn't figure out how he was going to get out of the predicament he was in and liked the outcome and the way it was done. Kind of a suspense, mystery.  I enjoyed the move a great deal!
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|if you have  bought or collected Jimi Hendrix's music throgh the years then you have been well aware of quite a few of these  tracks from many years  already. this project like quite a  few that have come out yearly over the past  few years feels like its been Elmered  GLued and  paste  together as if its something worth having. unless you are a die hard Hendrix fan, this ain't that deep.  and  unless its a bootleg concert or something really rare then the vault stuff is in there for a reason and a purpose and fans who have been done with Hendrix from way back when can tell of certain things being tweaked and  re worked. with Hendrix he was anything but a polished finished product and that is something that when so called new tracks are being out, outta be taking into account.

0307949486|3.0|Originally titled Men Who Hate Women in Swedish, journalist Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the first book in his Millennium Trilogy. At his sudden death in 2004 of a heart attack, he left behind this and two other unpublished novels that completed the trilogy; sadly, he was never able to witness their publication or success. Among his many accomplishments as an activist and journalist, Larsson founded the Swedish magazine Expo, which exposed extremist right-wing and racist groups. He worked on his crime sagas at night. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo became a hit throughout Europe upon publication in January 2008; this fall, it finally reached the United States (translated from the Swedish by Reg Keeland) as a bestseller, too.<br /><br />The novel focuses on a middle-aged journalist named Mikael Blomkvist, publisher of a well-known Stockholm-based magazine called Millennium. After losing a libel case brought by a Swedish industrialist gangster named Wennerstrom, Blomkvist is hired by Henik Vanger, the CEO of the wealthy Vanger Corporation, to write a memoir of the family's history. Henrik's real reason for hiring the journalist is to solve a cold case - the disappearance of Vanger's niece Harriet when she was sixteen in the small town of Hedestad. The town is largely populated by the scions of the Vanger family, and the forty-year-old cold case points to one of them as the suspect. Thrown into the mix is the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Lisbeth Salander--a ruthless, tattooed, punk hacker who has been victimized by authorities her entire life and was paid to dig up everything about Blomkvist after his libel trial brought him into media attention. Blomkvist becomes impressed with her hacking abilities, and the two set out to find the answers to Harriet's disappearance, forging a love connection while turning into the hunted during their quest for the truth.<br /><br />The mystery behind the young girl's disappearance is very well orchestrated, with enough red herrings and twists and turns to keep the pages flying by. Themes of corrupt corporations, lingering Nazism, and the separation between love and lust swirl around these characters as they try to make sense of a crime that even the authorities have lost interest in. Peppered throughout the novel are mentions of other crime writers - Agatha Christie, Val McDermid, Sara Paretsky - who Blomkvist reads vigorously in his pursuit for solutions. In these sections, Larsson tips his hat to the authors whose work he loved and studied. The world of Stockholm and the freezing tundra of Hedestad are expertly sketched, the icy surroundings reflecting both the Vanger family's demeanor and Blomkvist's and Salander's own shortcomings.<br /><br />A major problem in the novel, however, is that Harriet's case gets solved far too early, so the last 100 pages are left to sort out Blomkvist's takedown of the gangster Wennerstrom and his attempt to bring the magazine Millennium back to its former glory after his name is dragged through the mud. Its final section aside, The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo is good for a long flight but not much more.enough red herrings and twists and turns to keep the pages flying by.

B004DLPXAO|4.0|I have used the Apple version of this apps for several years, and I think this android version is as good, if not better. The text is very clear, easily resized for viewer preference, and I like having direct access to the Amazon on-line book store.
0439023513|2.0|Includes spoilers<br /><br />I couldn't put this down, needing to find out what would happen, so in that sense Mockingjay was a success for me.<br />But it isn't something that I'll ever read again, and on reflection I don't like it very much.<br /><br />The things it does well it does very well.  It puts a realistically bloody and painful face on war.  It jars the reader with the realization that there is no simple us against them.  Some of what the rebels do is just as despicable as what the capital has done.<br /><br />But.....<br /><br />Character Development<br />Katniss, never a really likable character, has always had a strong moral core.  She tries to help other people even when it's not in her best interests to do so; she isn't vengeful the way that Gale often is. She goes in after the mine avalanche to help an enemy soldier.  But at the end of the novel she votes to create another hunger games.  Completely out of character and a good way to make the readers lose any respect that they still had for her.  Not that they had much left when she's spent the majority of the novel in a severe depression.  Depression is better shown than narrated.  Narrated depression gets old very very fast.  And then there's her ambivalence about her two love interests.  Her actions rather than her narration prove her to be manipulative with them.<br /><br />So: crumbling moral values, depression and emotionally manipulative.  That doesn't add up to a protagonist that I care about.  In fact, I was rather hoping that Collins would kill her off.  The only reason that the audience has to hope otherwise is that it would break Peeta's heart.<br /><br />Peeta, the only good, sweet and moral person in the entire series (with the possible exception of Prim, Finnick and Annie) is terribly changed by the trackerjacker venom.  At first I, like many other readers, thought that this was an opportunity for personal growth.  Now Peeta could learn to know and love Katniss without the rose colored glasses that he's had on since he was a child.  Except that Peeta doesn't.  Not that the reader is shown, at any rate.  He gets a bit better but never expresses any real love for her again.  And if Peeta isn't consumed with love for her, if he could survive without her, then what reason is there for a reader, any reader to care about her survival?<br /><br />Plot<br />Almost the entire last fourth of the book is taken up by Katniss' squad's attempt to infiltrate the capital and take out Snow.  This is a completely wasted effort as they arrive at the mansion at the same time as the rest of the rebels.  This means that all the excruciating deaths that occur in this time frame are wasted lives.  Not just wasted lives but wasted emotions on the part of the readers.  There is no catharsis in terms of either plot or character development for those deaths. And actually, there's no catharsis for anything else either.  Consider the ending: Katniss and Peeta drift together.  We are not shown this, we are told.  Gale and Katniss' mother disappear without apparent emotion from Katniss.  It's very apathetic.  Even the discussion of Katniss' own children is lukewarm.  Does she love them? Given how fiercely and deeply she loved Prim I expect that from her but it's as though her fire has gone out.  And if it's gone out then what are we to make of her declaration that she loves Peeta?  How can she?<br /><br />So, unresolved character development.  Now, unresolved plot.  Did Coin or Snow order the deaths of those children?  We never find out.  And Katniss' actions in killing Coin can't be resolved to the reader without knowing.  Without knowing there's no emotional reaction to Coin or Snow's deaths.<br /><br />Was there actually another hunger games?  Presumably there was, because there was a vote on it and there's never any discussion of it being cancelled.  But it was Coin's idea and Coin is dead, and does Katniss' vote really count if they've decided that her killing Snow was the act of a mentally unstable person?<br /><br />Unresolved endings aren't necessarily a bad thing.  In fact, some of our most important novels are unresolved.  But usually that applies to either plot or character development but not both.

I really like the Weather Channel web site, so as a work-around I use an Opera (web browser) bookmark for quick access to the site. On the positive side, the Apple version of the Weather Channel apps works great.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Crude language detracted from content of story and style of the presentation was rather unsophisticated in a literary sense. A good story though.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The book was good, despite the controversy. I have to admit that the first book was my favorite. The other two weren't as interesting after the magic had worn off.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I use this app exclusively on my phone. Flow works well. Word completion is very good. Themes are a nice touch.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|I cannot express how much I enjoyed reading this book. The beginning started off slow and had be wondering why I started in the first place, but once things got going I couldn’t put it down. The characters are so complex and interesting you’ll wonder about them weeks after you read the book. The book has a little bit of a dark side, mixed with religion and politics. Human nature is quite a thing. By far one of John Steinbeck’s best.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|The author has a distinctive penchant for made up military jargon that is often convincing. The books greatest pleasure for me was the rigorously contemplated implications of a zombie menace concerning logistics and wide scale maneuvers of humanities response to such a threat.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|We all want to believe in magic. I believe that’s why I’m always drawn to these types of books.<br />Think: Harry Potter meets Hunger Games. A more adult verson or magic and mischief.  The story takes the reader through a twisted magical world with a dark sexy side.
B004EPZ06G|5.0|Continues on with same set of hilarious cast and just keeps on Rolling. Looking so forward to seeing number 3. This, the Big Lebowski and South Park hit it out of the park for me.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Can't wait to read the next one. It's a great series and so addictive. This story is very unpredictable and exciting. Worth every penny!!!
0553583182|5.0|Everyone should read this book to understand the workings of your mind and this world. It was a huge eye opener for me. I learnt a lot. I get much more done much easier and faster now and much more comfortably, without hesitation. I truly understood after reading this book that nothing is impossible to achieve no matter what situation you are in and no matter what your background is.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Play on my kindle. Its slow to load and transitions are slow. Also seems to drain battery faster than other aps.
1582701709|5.0|This is one of the most life changing books I have ever read. I now understand truly that nothign is impossible. I understand and practice to understand the workings of my subsconscious mind to get closer to my goals.<br />Must read book!
B006LA6IW2|5.0|This is a hero's tale which lays bare the sometimes ugly truth behind what our elite soldiers think and do during life and death battle.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I have heard talk about this book everywhere and I just don't get the big deal. The writing g is like something a high schooler would come up with.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I didn't realize how many I had missed.  I picked it up in the second season, fell in love with it, and finally now all the pieces fit
B002BSHWUU|5.0|This is a great, complete compilation that includes every single released Beatles song! The artwork is carefully recreated from the original LP releases, there are informative and entertaining videos on every disc. This is a great package for people who own no Beatles recordings as well as the best way to enjoy The Beatles in a lovingly preserved digital format.
0061692034|2.0|Why Canada for a title?  The book should have been named Tedium.  Most of the story took place in the US  and was a lengthy, drawn out, tedious  introspective character analysis. A good book has memorable plot, character and setting. This book had no plot, and the author still managed to go on for almost 500 pages; that, in and of itself, is the primary achievement of this novel.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|sound & picture quality excellant & well priced. you need the whole series to really appreciate the story line. Maggie Smith just steals the show
B008JFUUQ2|4.0|I got the Bluray combo pack in the mail today expecting something I love. Pitch Perfect, but without a slipcover!!! My first reaction was, are you effing kidding me. Slipcovers are a big deal to Bluray collectors. And if I knew Amazon wasnt going to include a slipcover. I would have bought it at Walmart for the same price! Amazon always includes slipcovers but this time I dont know why. As for the movie, well it was amazing.
B006M9NJFG|5.0|This canteen is so much bigger than i thought it would be. It is a hard plastic. The cooking cup i am a little scared to use because it dose not seem that thick and what not. I still love this canteen
0375842209|3.0|Let me begin by saying that I've tried really, really hard to like this book. Over the past two years, I've read and reread the first 300 pages seven times, but I've been unable to get past that point. It's not that the book is poorly written - on the contrary, it's one of the most well-written young adult novels in recent years. It's not that the premise isn't interesting, either - the book being narrated by Death and all. The problem I have with it is Zusak's writing philosophy in this book: that every page should contain a \\"gem.\\" It's this writing style that bothers me the most, and has rendered me unable to finish this book.<br /><br />I've tried so hard, but The Book Thief just isn't for me.
B002SR2PKG|3.0|First of all the book is too long, could have been cut in half there is a lot of unneeded dialogue and side stories, such as the cabbie, that Don't really add to the story. Pretty good though if shorter
6300215741|5.0|Fantastic acting.  A lot of action and great romantic scenes. Cary Grant & Princess Grace do well together.  Fun movie.
B00AEBB8UQ|5.0|Although I had not seen the t.v.version of SOUTH PARK(IDONT GET COMEDY CENTRAL,unfortunately)for some reason I decided to see this film when it came out theatrically. I don't remember laughing so hard before! This has got to be one of the funniest movies ever, if not the best musical ever! I certainly would not recommed this for anyone under at least sixteen, I WOULD recomend it to everyone else. The musical numbers range from DISNEY parodies to LES MIS, and stick in my brain. It's hard to choose my favourite number. I'm torn between&#34; UP THERE&#34;and &#34;LA RESISTANCE&#34;. After listening to this soundtrack and the cast album of &#34;BOOK OF MORMON&#34; I REALLY APPRECIATE What  great composers Trey and Matt are!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the character development, Always rooting for the good guys !<br />Plot twists and turns while at times, unrealistic,  keep me waiting to view the next episode!
B00867GHS8|5.0|i frigin love this movie. i was ecstatic when it came out on bluray/collectors edition. came on time, and was definitely well worth the price, got it when it was at its lowest price at $25
B002QS5OQ4|4.0|I watched SG1 and really like that they have incorporated characters into SGU.  It is really cool how they use the stones to exchange bodies to see their family members.  Start watching one episode and can't stop.  I usually watch 2 or 3 at a time.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My 13 yr old had me download this game & we both love playing it together.  It is so much fun & addictive.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is so AWESOME that is the only character trait fir this game well there is more like cool sweet creeper
B008Y6O67U|5.0|I liked this movie because Precious was just like a real person.No fake Hollywood stuff here just the real thing.Almost anyone would like this movie.Makes one think about it long after the movie is over.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|I got this book because of the rave reviews. I found the humor was in poor taste and it was quite graphic sexually. Definitely not recommended for school reading. It kind of sickened me.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|If you appreciate fantasy, you will love this for so many reasons and because it feels endless.  Still waiting for the last book.
0345525558|3.0|Just an okay book.  I can see why many people like it and it's written very well.  But I enjoy books that make me fall in love with the main character, not hate her.  This book had me constantly disagreeing with her.  The ending was good and I like the actual definitions and meanings of the flowers, learning about them kept me drawn but other than that, I kind of wished I had borrowed this from someone and not bought it.  Not one that I'd read over and over again but that's just me.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Have read the entire series....my only complaint is that I may have to read them all again before the final book comes out because it's taking so long!  As the sequels progress, more fantasy and characters are woven in.  Great characters, maybe a little too much detail on distant family lines sometimes, but still keeps me turning pages!
B0058YPL66|5.0|This is the best T.V series out today that I have seen so far, enough to buy it. I can't wait to own the 2nd Season!! :) :)
B007THA4FI|3.0|I've been trying to read this, but it's hard to keep an interest.  I guess I'm more of a fantasy/sci-fi fan, and perhaps because this is more of a realistic story, so I find it less appealing.  Set it aside after the first five chapters, but I'm not one to give up.  Going to give it another try because JK is a master.
B005USZYDU|4.0|You get to clearly know the characters and want to learn more about them.  Theo is a very likable character and I wish new someone like that in middle / high school.  Hopefully Grisham will allow him to mature and we can follow him through college and into adulthood.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|If you're a Steely Dan fan, you will greatly appreciate this solo release from Fagen.  Glad I added this to our collection.
B00932AA5G|4.0|Great movie and great streaming video quality. I never had any issues with choppiness or buffering.  Only problem was that it was in German (with subtitles)!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|If you can get through the first 50 or so pages of the first of the series, you are hooked for the rest.  Lisbeth's character is a little Zuckerberg and Bourne combined.  Each book is as good as the last....you will not want to put it down!
B002ZG9788|5.0|So if you're buying this movie, you probably already know something about about the story line, so I won't really go into that.  I will say that the Blu Ray quality of this film is very good.  The special affects look amazingly real.  I would recommend this product.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|My wife and I love spending evenings watching this show. The characters are funny and through the years their interactions and relationships build to a level that make the comedy, drama, and horror that much better.<br />Not always entirely appropriate (or entertaining) for young children or teens, target audience is high school or above (an audience that appreciates the challenges of life failure and community college woes as well as the dynamics of unity with diversity).
0764169742|5.0|I have lots of books from these specifc theme, but, with pencil is the first. I'm realy suprised n' happy cause I love this book.<br />Thanks.<br />Carolina Castilho
B009VB97EY|3.0|My god, this film is NOT ALL THAT! AND BELIEVE ME I LIKE TO SEE MEN W/OUT CLOTHES, that's for sure! HA!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|great game. hours of fun. I continue to play to see if I can beat it faster then the last time
B0036EH3XE|5.0|We did not watch this series when it aired.  A neighbor got us hooked when he let us borrow the first two seasons.  Sure, it gets a little quirky near the end of it's run, but we found ourselves watching consecutive episodes on the weekends.  We really enjoyed it.  If you watch, do so from the start.  There are too many intertwined stories to start anywhere else.
B001EBWITA|5.0|I rented this so a friend could watch it cause I've seen it so many times and I talk about it so much. It is as I titled AWESOME
B0019LY5IM|5.0|We did not watch this series when it aired.  A neighbor got us hooked when he let us borrow the first two seasons.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|get it is so omg you need to get this app you can have a horse it is so cool I love this so much<br /><br />a

B0050X1OQ6|4.0|Worked great with my Synology 1812 and I agree with all previous great reviews. Don't want to add anything more.
B002S0KBUY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, it was a definite page turner. Jodi Picoult is an excellent author. A must read.
B002361MLA|4.0|You can see why Eckhart Tolle is considered a great teacher.  He explains all of his ideas with great simplicity and passion.  Probably could have been a little shorter as he re-treads things a lot.  Whether I agree with him or not about exactly how consciousness and the universe work, I would recommend this to seekers.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great game, really enjoy the challenges of trying to destroy and/or take out monkeys and things.  It makes you think about how to accomplish tasks to complete a level.
B005PK553C|2.0|I thought photography was good, focus and presage shots weren't telegraphed and actors delivered reasonable performances. THE BIG HOWEVER,it's another haunted house plot only deadly slow and sans shocks (You know what I mean) and appears to be predictable, like uh-oh now the squirley kid will jump out from bushes and we won't ever get to see her horrible ugliness and be terrified. Am I being too hard on it?
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Muy interesante como describe la época en tiempos de Stalin me llevo pasó a paso sentí el frío del país.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read tons of reviews on this book & the sample before going for it, after the price dropped. I thought for a dollar I had nothing to lose. I think this is one of those books were I wouldn't change a thing. It is a beautifully YA story on a delicate subject. I am very happy that I took the chance & read it for myself.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game is a bit glitchy and can run slow but aside from that I am absolutely in love with this game!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a fun game for kids.I love going to the different places.you get addicted after a while.I want you to play this game.
B006LSZECO|3.0|it took me 40% of the reading to really start to be very interested about this book. I was almost about to give up, but I wanted to see the end of it and that was really disappointing. I don't want to go in to detail, but it is not my type of book. I wouldn't recommend it.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show has the best writing and screenplay production in the industry, combined with inately believable and seamless acting performances across the breadth of its complex and talented cast. The story provides a rich and salient insight into the uniquely American struggle with issues such as patriotism, war, family, and national security in the post September 11 world. It does so with an evenly balanced blend of &#34;Father Knows Best&#34; , &#34;24&#34; and &#34;The West Wing&#34;.  What else could a TV fan ask for? Ten more seasons?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think it is really fun. Also people can own horses without really having to take care of them. I love how my horse always has energy.
0451232852|4.0|The book was great, but I would prefer to have hard cover OR larger print .... as my old eyes have to strain a bit reading paperback.  The order arrived in a timely manner, and basically I was pleased with your service.
B003M6TVQI|5.0|Great show! This show is smart, clever, funny, and easy to follow. All the characters  are great together and are very likeable!
B000B5XOYI|5.0|I bought this as a gift to myself. These films bring back many childhood memories. They are very imaginative and a must have for any Batman fan. I've watched these over and over and haven't even opened my Dark Knight set yet. Delivery was prompt and the price was right.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game. Good busy work. Simple enough to play with my 3 year old son. Good fun family time.
B007R41E8O|4.0|Do like it but it tends to stop at random times for no reason. But all in all a good game and price...
B007HACDLK|4.0|I wonder if some of this is true.  He keeps you turning the  pages.  I couldn't put the book down.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|One doesn't have to review Downton Abbey. It's a hit in many countries around the world. But kudos to Amazon for its delivery to mt Fire HD without one single buffering slowdown and two seasons for free so I could catch up while waiting for season 3 to start. Now I am watching West Wing and Falling Skies. I love my Kindle and Thank you Amazon and Prime.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are easy to read and engrossing. Yes, the writing style is formulaic but that's what lends to their readability. The characters are easy to love or hate and the writing moves the books along. It is easy to get swept away by this trilogy.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Liked this flick.  Good story, cast and special effects.  Worth buying or renting.  A prequel to the Alien movies, and is worth watching.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|I just received this album and am playing right now. WOW! It has been years since I bought one of his posthumously released albums. It reminds me how BIG a loss his death was - damn. All the bulls*** that has gone down since 1970 and how jaded we have become crashes down on me as I listen.  Get It?
B008CJ0KBU|3.0|I love shows about supernatural.<br />I loved season one.<br />Season two was iffy, started downhill.<br />Season three, lame.<br /><br />The writing went downhill starting season 2.  Season 3 shows how writing and storylines can really ruin a good<br />show.  Lame lame lame.<br /><br />Love the ensemble cast though.<br />Bo:  Hot.  Great character and acting.<br />Kensi:  Superhot.  Great.<br />Blood King:  COOL.<br />Werewolf:  Cool.  Sometimes acting a bit rough.<br />Siren:  Was OK, until made Ash.  Then character is a bit lame.<br />Doctor: OK.  Nice.  Character is clingy and crummy.<br /><br />Lesbian tilt would be ok, but is a bit over the top sometimes.  Too much so.<br /><br />The show has sooooo much potential.  But again, the storylines got very weak and lousy.<br /><br />Removed the recording timer once third season, but decided to stay with it.<br /><br />The show could be so much, but went really downhill.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was a great series of books. Wish they would make another series of one or more of the characters in the book.
B00AY9RV90|5.0|great to hear some new new order after all these years. this was the first music I bought from amazon and it seemed to work fine!
B005LAJ16I|1.0|Wtiting on this show has deteriorated to the point that the plots make no sense. Maybe they should have sent the writers for electro-shock therapy instead of the main character.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is beautifully written and holds your attention throughout! Congratulations, Markus Zusak! Hopefully you have many more planned for your readers!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is amazingly awesome. It was out of the box when you play in a race against a cop. Getting the upgrades is so intense especially the jetpack.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Discriptions of the time period, scenery, mood and personalities were so well done that I found myself thinking about the people and places as if they were my neighbors.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved Catching Fire!  There were several surprises in the plot, and I just love it when a story is NOT predictable.  This book was easy to read and kept me wanting for more.  If you loved the Hunger Games, then you will love this book, too!
B00338QENI|5.0|Very well researched and written...  goes to show that truth really is stranger than fiction.  I was impressed at how impartial Ms. Skloot was in her covereage of the story.  Highly recommend - I'm sure I will read this one again.
B008OOYALE|4.0|this is the second game i've played by TeamLava, love the games fun very addicting. great for kids also, kids will love the colorful dragons
031606792X|5.0|Was the greatest ending to the greatest series of books!<br />Very great pricing as well, and I would refer to anyone!
1601251831|5.0|Currently using this to adapt some of my 3.5 D&D adventures to Pathfinder and it's been really easy using this. Great starting point for any new Pathfinder DM; definitely recommend.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|The product of the movie on the cloud was awesome! But the movie was sad! I hate when they use all the funny parts in the trailers!<br />But most definately worth watching!
1601251505|5.0|Pathfinder has pretty much become my new game system. I loved 3.5 D&D, and would have been interested in playing 4.0, had it not been catered for a MMORPG audience - with no crafting system to be had. A friend of mine got me interested and I've never looked back since. I can't imagine playing D&D 3.5 now, it's Pathfinder for me - they are perfectly similar, but Pathfinder however updates and streamlines things that should've been a long time ago. I have no complaints.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|But its Daniel Craig as James Bond so he'll be amazing I know he will and the movie will be amazinbg because its James Bond! I love them ALLL!
B002GY9F9K|5.0|When it was on the TV I watched it when I could and loved the story line. I missed a lot of episodes. When I found the series on Amazon.com I had to buy both seasons.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|never played a game on my kindle this well made real winner in my book. five star would have been better placed with better worlds though
B0015AARJI|5.0|The controller that came with his PS3 finally played out from over use and he needed another one. I checked several stores but the price was too high. So when I found this one on Amazon.com I bought it. The price was great and my grandson love being able to play his games again.
B000FC1AGG|2.0|Easy lighthearted read. The main character is sadly not very likable and frustrating to follow for her social deficiencies. Good book for a long plane ride or late nights nursing the baby to sleep.
B00004Y87O|3.0|love the cheesy acting and i do see revelence in the message for today also and was nice to revisit the movie
B001BKG9SK|5.0|A wonderful experience! David Gilmour is a fantastic artist, and having all the famous Pink Floyd songs (or rather, most of them) on one CD/DVD set is amazing. The music is, of course, phenomenal, and the performance does the songs justice. If you're a pink floyd fan, you NEED this DVD set!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is epic app it is so epic it is epic nice graphics and stuff not as sensitive as temple run. 1
B009UX2YAC|5.0|take my advice and GET THIS APP. I am 11and know what's cool theses days ;) I lov this app. you can chose from a bunch of diffrent people and every day they have a cool challenge 4 you but the question is  are YOU up 4 the challenge?<br />$TAPICKELS$
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Such an amazing read! I honestly can't put it down. I can't wait to read Matthew Quick's other books : )
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|But it got repetitive over time. Its basically Bejeweled, then at the &#34;end levels&#34; you take the items that you recovered during your bejeweled sessions, and place them on a painting to get a jewel. The jewels unlock something. The overall &#34;meat and potatoes&#34; of the game is bejeweled.
B001MTENOC|5.0|If you, as I am, are interested in metaphysics, this book will provoke much thought. It was brilliant of the author to think of using hypnotic regression to explore the &#34;in between&#34; of lives, but I found his method very intrusive and coercive of his subjects. A scientist in relentless pursuit of his goal.  Ignore that and ponder the information he gathered.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This games just like temple run but a million times better. Subway surfers is the coolest game I've ever played
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|Great entertainment!  My grandchildren watch it over and over, and of course, it brings back great memories of my childhood.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|It was fun but to short wish it was a bit longer puzzles were tough enough to keep you occupied
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I would rate is book 5 stars because of its amazing and breathtaking and super amazing book ever because of adventure.
0553801473|5.0|I bought the book for a gift for someone. He loves to read and finished it a weekend. wishing their were more books. Love the series also can't wait for them to start again
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Pretty colors, lots of levels, keeps me interested.  Good hand/eye coordination.  Great for everyone to play and keep the mind working!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the film first and was prepared to be disappointed by the inadequacies of the film to the book, but was unprepared for what I found. The film followed the main ideas of the book well but was pleasantly surprised by the details I found in the book. Suzanne Collins wonderfully lays out things in the beginning of the book which play out throughout the story. There also were little details which were unable to be portrayed in the film but made the book that much more enjoyable. I think Suzanne Collins is a brilliant writer and will definitely be on the lookout for more of her novels!
B008645YEE|4.0|The album itself is not bad. sure it has tons of songs missing. The songs in this album all appear in the movie so there's not much to complain about in my opinion
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I like this game so much the only thing is I wish I had more gems...and I wish I could play it any where
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I don't understand all the hate for this film. Yes, we all know Heath did a superb job in TDK, so of course everybody was expecting Nolan to top it. Did he? I'm not so sure, but that does not mean the movie wasn't great. So lets stop the hate and accept that Nolan and Goyer gave everyone a thrilling trilogy to enjoy.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|I grew up on comic books. So I am familar with a lot of characters from Stan Lee. I like Robert Downey Jr. and the way he plays this character. He shows that although Iron Man is a superhero, he also has flaws.  Nobody is perfect. Don Cheadle one of my favorite actors plays his character with humor and sympathy.<br />Also nothing like having some new allies to help you fight the bad guys. Plenty of action and not always predictable. I'm looking forward to more movies of this kind with Robert Downey Jr.<br />The movie reminded me of a simpler time, when we look for Superheros to solved the problems of the world.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The first season was a great start, the second second was even better despite it not moving around too much. The third season is living up to my expectations so far, so in the end I'll predict it'll be better than the first two seasons.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|I loved this 3D movies. It was exciting had a lot of actions. The movie was so realsitic at times I found myself ducking.<br />I found myself marveling at the color content and the way it came across the screen. What I'm learning that these movies are made to watch in 3D High Definition. Anything else and one could not experience the movie the way the director wanted you to see it.<br />The characters continue their role and was pretty predictable. But the actions scenes made up for the predictability.
0307595579|5.0|The books come in a beautiful bookcase and covers. The extra books on Larsson is an even better bonus. This is must have if your a fan.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|I liked the Lion King when it first made in 1994. This is great for the kids. It shows kids in a kind way that sometimes even relatives may not always have your best interest at heart.  The movie also teaches children you have to believe in your self.<br />It is indeed a beloved classic and one of the few movies I would recommemd for children five and up.<br />The 3D version was good not too intense to scare children but just enough so that they can enjoy the experience.<br />This is definitely a Family Movie!
B005OCFHHK|4.0|For the price of 8 movies its totally worth it, but my only dislike about this collection is that it doesn't have all the special features that the single movies had. The first few movies have a significant amount of features but the later ones have almost no features. So if you want loads of features I'd say buy the movies individually. But If your just looking to enjoy the films , there's nothing wrong with this collection.
B009JBZH54|5.0|First and foremost, this is not for children who are under the age of 13. This trilogy is dark violet and explores what man will do man as well as the response when one is pushed to their limits.<br />The movie explores the line between good and evil and sometimes it is not that easy to discern.<br />Christian Bale comes across as the Dark Knight. One one has to watch all three movies to see how his character grows into this \\"dark and ominous character \\"The Dark Knight who is also battling his own demons.<br />It is a shame about Heath Ledger. I'm sure if he was alive, he would have played in the last  installment and that would have bought  a different perspective to the film.<br />Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman gave the movie its good characters; the ones that see clarity. But again, pushed to their limits.<br />Plenty of action, plenty of plots, good variation of the scenes and no predictabiliy. Must watch all three to understand the last one.
0955153077|5.0|i haven't read through the whole book yet but I'm loving every page I'm reading so far. The steps are easy to follow and the book itself is nicely design, including the slipcase it comes with.
B005PK553C|5.0|Loved every minute of this season.  Make sure the kids are in bed before you put this one on though!
0061692034|3.0|i have enjoyed reading this book, and will order his other novels. i have given this book to other friends.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Plenty of fun. Not too complicated. Well executed. Tons of replay value.Very polished and professional.<br /> Works great on my Razr Maxx.
0062082353|5.0|Chris Kyle was a true American Hero.  This autobiography is well written bringing the reader into the life of this navy Seal sniper and showing us mere mortals the challenges or soldiers face both in war and at home.  My only sadness in reading this book is that Chris Kyle was killed by someone he was trying to help after surviving some terrifying events overseas.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|A really enjoyable movie - I appreciated that they pointed out the U.S.' role in instigating the entire event, although the rescue was truly heroic. Maybe the &#34;IT'S A TRUE STORY&#34; aspect was beaten over the audiences head a bit much, and probably could have been related to the film in a more subtle, organic way, but otherwise, the storyline flowed very well and I was kept on the edge of my seat.
B000Z8GZYW|4.0|I'm not much of a Bill Murray fan, but he's perfect in this movie. Saw it when it first came out and liked it. Then bought it all these years later to celebrate Groundhog's Day... and because the repetitive aspects of life are getting to me. (Do you ever get tired of washing your hair every few days?) Might as well laugh about it, huh? But it's more than just a funny movie. Trapped in the same day over and over, Bill's character explores all the stages of grief... denial, anger, bargaining, etc. all the way to acceptance. And beyond... to become a bodhisattva of sorts. Am I making too much out of a simple comedy? Probably. Forgive me, it's been a very long winter.
B000I3P3EM|4.0|...but it's Star Trek so it's awesome. Apparently there were some storyline issues for Shatner from the beginning, but I think he pulled it together for some coherence. It's still an enjoyable movie!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put this book down. I'm so ready for the next one! Suzanne Collins is a literary genius!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I was having huge overheating problems with my CPU. Everytime i run video games, the temperature would spike over 100 degrees C, with an idle temp of over 50 degrees. Now that i installed it, it never goes above 45 degrees. the idle temp is 30 degrees.<br /><br />this is a MASSIVE improvement over the stock cooling unit.
B005H9B44A|2.0|This movie was a bust. There wasn't near enough action. If the movie would have been more action adventure like it was supposed to it could have gone somewhere .
B008HK3XYK|5.0|Didn't want to pay alot of money for a case, found this colorful case, a little textured outside,<br />but fully protective inside and reasonablly priced.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|This movie had real life hardships in it that family's must sometimes face. It is a story about how a family completely breaks apart, but is able to come together at the very end. The individual stories of the character's are very emotional and sometimes you really aren't sure who to root for.
B006LA6IW2|5.0|Great book by a great man. R.I.P.  Chris Kyle.  Thank you for everything. Your service, toughness, and your character. Good stuff.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|It was great. It seemed like a completely different movie series. Great dialogue, great actors, and a great story that made me look in my mirror and feel 10 years older.
B0095P3ULC|5.0|I have look at this movie more times than any other movie, and this a jewel. I like the mini-robots and how they truly help save the day. This is a good movie for the children, and family night.
B009LS4KM6|4.0|Fun movie. Follows the story loosely. My four year old loved it.  He makes me read him the story now, and tells me what is going to happen.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|My Kindle Fire came with a Facebook app already installed, and it doesn't run well; freezes up a lot, and have to keep starting it over. Tried Full FB Free, and it runs no differently than my app. Freezes up the same way at the same points.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|An insightful explanation of why the modern economy is prone to crashing, with direct implications on what you can do to be safer, happier, and more ethical than the silly folks who got us into this mess. It's about economics, but fundamentally it can be used for self-improvement.<br /><br />It's long and deep, but unlike most flashy modern books promising answers and solutions to life's problems, none of it is filler. It's all there for a reason, and it pays back the time investment to read it slowly and surely.
B004NELBPC|4.0|Really like this app, didn't think it would be as detailed and easy running as this is. I like that it has so many options.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Having a tough time in a relationship? Or perhaps sick of being single? Or maybe you just had a bad day at work? Read this book! It's uplifting, very lovey, and still has a touch of adventure.  I would recommend to anyone who perhaps recently lost a loved one, or even to anyone who needs a distraction from real life.  The ending is lovely.... trust me. Read it!
B00787IR2Q|3.0|Didn't stream well. Had same problem with other movies I've rented. Checked to see if it was my device or my settings, but it's not.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|The beginning of this novel in no way caught my attention, but give it some time and it will surely suck you in!  This is a part romance part adventure story that will keep you guessing on what will happen next.  I hate to admit that some words (and phrases) flew right over my head and I got slightly lost on a few parts (which has never happened to me before).  Still, I enjoyed the plot and would recommend it to anyone who read twilight, and perhaps an advanced reader. Keep in mind, this is a series!  You'll probably want to read the second one.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Ben Affleck does an excellent kob of acting and directing the cast. Great cast of know ane little known actors. Story starts a little slow but takes off. Great suspense! Great movie!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I've never been one for documentary style books either true or fictitious, but something about World War Z took hold of me and wouldn't let go. Every character tells a compelling story that even though they are telling it and therefore you know they survived you are still on the edge of your seat over and over again for each individuals account. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, no matter their reading preference.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Charlize Theron is the evil Queen. She does a smoking job in this movie. Chris Hemsworth is the Huntsman. he hired by the evil queen to find Snow White. Dark movie. Great action and adventure!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy et al has done it again!<br /><br />I just finished the novel when it was reported that the Chinese were conducting Cyber attacks aginst the USA from a non-discript, high-rise  building in Singapore! It was almost a re-read from &#34;Threat Vector&#34;!<br /><br />Informative AND frightning and Clancy's novels are still considered fiction!?!
B00BESLHEA|4.0|Loaded action fairy tale type Kung Fu movie. If you liked Kill Bill you will like this. Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu are great. Non stop action!<br />Wacky martial arts action.
B0086213XW|1.0|It's a movie about a crazy girl who says she loves her husband but then falls in love with another man.  She was just too weird and crazy to watch.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Great villian you love to hate. Excellent plot keeps you guessing which way will this go? Probably Daniel Craigs best bond movie yet. Non stop action!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. A little dragging at times but over all really good. I read it while I was in Thailand
B00AMBH70S|5.0|hard to beat the prior Bourne action movies but this one is just as great and the previous Bourne thriller action movies. Jeremy Renner is great! Action start to finish!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Love this CD. bought it for my sister in law, and its great-- start to finish. (not sure what else to write but i needed 4 more words in this review.)
B001XULSG6|5.0|Excellent Star Trek Next Generation movie. Brent Spinner is excellent in kicking Borg butt. There are some really funny parts to this movie also. Lots of action and adventure.
B00BHMF578|3.0|It was a good movie but what really bothered me is that they never payed any attention to the other 51 captives. Not really sure why it won best picture.
B009CPE424|5.0|This is a funny movie! Kids love! George Lopez does a great job as the Papa Chihuahua catching the bad guys and taking care of the family. Lots of laughs!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best games I have ever played on my kindlefire. I love how they go on world tour and we can have an Easter egg hunt!!!!!<br /><br />YOU SHOULD GET THE GAME
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|At first the book was slow but like humanity itself, it evolved into a good read that was thought provoking and well before its time. I enjoyed it and was completely caught off guard by unfolding events that I did not anticipate.
B007FDE4Y8|3.0|I've never used a Steadicam of any type, so this was a new experience for me and I needed some help. The product is nice, but Opteka completely fails when it comes to support and documentation. The documentation sent was about as minimal as you can get, just one piece of paper with basic instructions. I was having trouble getting the Steadicam to balance properly so it didn't move, so I contacted Opteka for some help. I sent them an email stating that I was having trouble getting it to stop swaying. This is the email I received, from their \\"support\\" department:<br /><br />Thank you for your email. I'm sorry to hear that you have been experiencing issues with this item. Unfortunately, we do not have any additional information at this time. I would urge you, however, to search on youtube for this product and similar products for more insight on how to use your stabilizer.<br /><br />Wait a minute, this is THEIR product, and they don't have any information about how to keep THEIR steadicam from swaying? They also can't even provide me any direct links to videos he'd recommend to provide help? Talk about abandoning your customer! If the word \\"stabilizer\\" hadn't been at the end, I would have thought this was an automated message (it still could be). After several hours of sifting through YT videos, I finally determined that I needed more weights (I have a Canon XA10 and it is heavier than the weights they provide, and the steadicam needs to be slightly bottom heavy), so I had to order them directly from Opteka and wait 4 days to receive them since they're not available on Amazon (2 day shipping on Amazon is free, from Opteka it's almost $30). Ugh.<br />As for the Steadicam itself, it's a solid piece of equipment. I've nearly got it balanced properly so I still have some sway. I just have to wait for the additional weights to come in and hopefully that will fix the issue.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Finally, an Android bible software with all the useful tools to enjoy studying the Bible.  Perfect for 7&#34; tablets to read anywhere.
B000GCFBQU|4.0|Abide Wtih Me by Elizabeth Strout<br />Tyler Castkee is a minister and has lost his wife. He has a 5 year old girl who he doesn't communicate much with. He has many other community problems besides his own:<br />How can love best be served, a married woman approached him and is beatten by her husband, his mother always on his case, school teacher threatening to toss the girl out of school,<br />The story also follows Charlie and his wife Doris and their kids. He's been to the city and had a sexual fling and it is on his mind a lot, when he should be thinking of other things..<br />The book also talks of Tyler's wife before she had passed away. He wants both of his girls to live with him, not just Katherine.<br />Murders and missing things add to many mysteries...
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Amazon is the only source for the book I was looking for, so I decided to try the Kindle app.  I have found the Kobo reader app and Google reader app much better in options and look.  Amazon should update Kindle app to take advantage of tablets with digitizers and active stylus input for note taking and scribbling on the pages.  That might upset the kindle hd owners though.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|Here you've got Sinatra during his day when still quite at the top of his game accompanied by simply a fabulous, well rehearsed orchestra. A classic and must for Sinatra fans.
B004SIP8W0|5.0|The English Speaking Version was put on a special edition VHS Tape with English Version listed on the picture cover.<br />All of the Speaking is done in English except the Germans who speak in German.
B001L5YW9I|1.0|The Last of the Mohicans is a fine movie, but the quality of the movie that streamed from Amazon was atrocious. It was worse than VHS quality. So much for Amazon digital.
1935597760|3.0|I'm about halfway through the book, and I don't know if I'll finish it. The story is mildly interesting, and the characters, though they're unoriginal and their dialogue is almost offensively cartoony (another reviewer called it \\"leprechauny\\" and I think that's perfect) are just appealing enough that I kind of care what  happens to them.<br /><br />The writing, though, is more excruciating the longer I read. Every single sentence is overwritten. Almost never does anyone \\"sit,\\" or \\"eat,\\" or \\"look,\\" or \\"walk,\\" or \\"go.\\" Instead everyone has to elaborately, fancifully, evocatively, expansively,  with many adjectives and adverbs and commas, go about their most mundane actions within a rich tapestry of verbiage, drenching the reader in a reverie of depth and meaning.<br /><br />LIKE THAT. THE WHOLE BOOK IS LIKE THAT.<br /><br />All the characters, all their actions, everywhere they are and everything around them. All in twice as many words as necessary, except when McKenna uses three times as many words, or more.<br /><br />They're farmers and pub keepers and small town old schoolmarms. Simplicity is their milieu.<br />You are not writing in the 19th century, and even if you were, you are not Henry James.<br />Trust your story and don't hide it behind overwrought wordiness. Pare it down.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I am grateful for this CD, love the songs and the artists who acted and sing in this.  I saw the amazing movie and now, am pleased to own the soundtrack.  Thanks to all who made the movie and this CD possible!  A true classic story, movie and CD of the music.
0684857219|5.0|There is more information in this book then anyone can possibly remember. An excellent resource that provided valuable ideas an motivation to take training to a new level.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|I love the 3D movies and this one lives up to all expectations, with lots of action, great sound recording and a nice way to get away from the real world for a couple of hours.
B00B6LS9HS|4.0|Jeff Scott Soto (of Yngwie and Journey fame) and members of the bands Eclipse and Work of Art deliver again on this 2nd disc...Learn to Live Again, Walk Away, Rise Up, Bad Boy are highlights....great melodic rock with an edge!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|This is a great action movie and I love the movie, soundtrack, and action.  This is my kind of movie for getting away from the world for a couple of hours.  Keep them coming!  3D yes!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Enjoy it every evening to relax a little before bed.  It is kind of addicting.  Would recommend to anyone that likes the movies!
B0059XTUVI|3.0|Meryl Streep does an amazing job in this movie!  It is like she is the real Margaret Thatcher.  The makeup, acting, absolutely fantastic.  How does she keep on acting and acting so well?<br />Delivered on time, quickly.<br />That said, this movie is not my taste.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|I found the historical information very interesting and I loved the format. The letters going back and forth were fun and the underlying plot kept me interested.
B0089LOKHG|2.0|No resolution for anything or anyone -- amd to think I waited so long to read it!<br />Lauren Oliver, write a fourth book and end that one properly, please.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game for the horse lover. Wish it had more choices for breeds and gear though. Even my 4 year old likes to help play.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I love this book...no matter all the negative reviews.  It transports you and enthralls you.  Underneath it all is a love story.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|It hit close to home, as my mom is currently incarcerated. I always wonder what everyday life is like for her. I watch way to much lifetime movies and have been scared with the over exaggeration of some situations. I do however recognize that just like Mrs. Kerman I feel the hardest part is the visiting of ones incarcerated loved one. The stress and strain of it is just to much. I also feel as she does interms of reintegration programs; they are simply unadequate and unless you have the love and full financial support from family. Your chances of returning are very high. In this book she talks about how prison for many is better than the life they have outside. Many don't know how to deal and they return just as fast as they left. It may not be society that landed that person in prison but, it's our resposnbility to help keep them out!
1419702238|3.0|I mean it was cool... funny accidents, unexpected twists... But I think that the author is runnning out of ideas. The first book was simply AMAZING, but the others were not so funny. Nevertheless, it still remains a nice book
B00ARAN9JW|4.0|For a pure action movie, its pretty good. Compared to the other movies, I think Resident Evil 4 was the best so far, but this is definitely progressing the story. No incredible acting here, but if you're keeping up with the movies, it'll make you want to know what happens in the next one.
1423140605|5.0|I'd been waiting for this book for over a year, and when I finally had it in my hands, I was soooo happy and relieved. It turned out to be even better than i had imagined; twists and turns in the plot, mixed with greek mythology.... I LOOOVED it!!! I can't wait for book number 4!
B00BHMF578|5.0|As a child of the 70's I thought I knew the story behind the hostage crisis. How wrong was I?  This was a great show with suspense, drama, humor, and Affleck does a great job of story telling.  The acting is extremely good and the story is more pertinent today than one might think.
B000FC0V3E|4.0|Read it many, many years ago.  If you want to &#34;feel&#34; like you are hanging out with writers, artists and poets, with their accompanying drinking and psychobable, plus enjoying the flavor of Spain in that era, this is the book for you.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|I'm a fan of Wes Anderson's early films and have been pretty disappointed with his recent efforts. I thought Darjeeling Limited was terrible and Fantastic Mr. Fox was mediocre at best. However, I'm happy to report that Moonrise Kingdom is great! Check it out. The child actors are wonderful and Bruce Willis, Ed Norton, Bill Murray are great.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|I loved this book! I was addicted-<br />It was amazing! I hope you read it! It was worth my money!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Heard a lot about the book but felt it was ok at best. There are a lot better books on the subject.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|This book is the best possible and Rick Riordan is an amazing author. I like it because it had to do with some of her favorite things
1451695195|4.0|I have no doubt there is a heaven so I did not have to be convinced. Ebans story is interesting and insightful.  It's  hard for me to explain why I give this book 4 stars, but I enjoyed it and recommend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  You just knew something else was coming. It was like reading a lifetime tv movie and it probably could be one.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|By the second series you will not want to stop.  It will be one of those series, that you will feel a loss when it is over. There should be more shows that families could watch together and not feel uncomfortable at any time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a great way to watch a show.  No commericals, does not take up space on the DVR and a great show!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wicked awesome<br />I believe that this is the best app ever since the history of games<br />Much better than temple run and zombie apocalypse
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have enjoyed every book in this series, much to my surprise. Katniss' adventures didn't sound all that thrilling to me when I first read about The Hunger Games as the movie was being made. I wasn't too interested in one more dystopian view of the future (isn't there an optimistic author out there???). My 86 year old mother convinced me to read Hunger Games and I was hooked. The last book in the series, Mockingjay, does not disappoint. Once again we;re thrust into katniss' chaotic world. Who to trust? Can the rebellion be successful? Will Katniss get her chance to kill President Snow? Will she ever settle down - can she ever have a normal life? Can anyone in PanEm? I read this book in less than a week and I work two full-time jobs, so you know I had to be involved enough to miss much needed sleep in order to find out what happens. If you've liked this series well enough to read Hunger Games and Catching Fire, you have to read this one to find out what happens. It's a fast paced conclusion. George R.R, Martin could take some tips from Suzanne Collins for his Song of Fire and Ice series!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Not at all what I expected!!  Read in less than 48 hours!! Wish there was a sequel so we know what happens
B001P1MZNI|5.0|for $1.99 how can you beat 22 Frank Sinatra w/Count Basie orchestra songs. Frank at his best. Only wish I had been in the audience.
B00AHSINKO|2.0|I was surprised when watching this movie that I was just plain bored!  I kept waiting for it to get better and wasn't impressed!
B00821PCJS|5.0|it was a great sci-fi but clean for the family. i would definitely reccomend this to anyone and everyone looking for a show.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I really like this app and urge anyone to get this one because of the levels you go through. I would have to give it A plus
B00AVXSOQI|5.0|I have always been a Jane Austen fan, and studied a number of her novels at University, and have also taught them. Northanger Abbey is one that I have heard about, but had never read. I loved it for a number of reasons. It displays that fine Austen trait of exposing the social customs, snobbery and hypocrisy of her era. There were also many examples of Austen's skill in using irony to highlight these. What made this novel particularly enjoyable is an entertaining storyline dominated by a sweet, young, naive, self-deluded heroine prone to fantasy and melodramatic inclinations. A Lizzie Bennett, Catherine is not, and it is delightfully refreshing to follow the foibles of young Catherine as she becomes more and more bogged down in self-deception. There is a wonderfully light-heartedness in this novel that is a contrast to some of the moral heaviness that can pervade Austen's writing. I recommend this book most highly.
B0060QM0AG|5.0|My spouse enjoys the descriptive way James Herriot writes. As an agriculturist he finds the stories right up his alley.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|It was well written and kept my interest from start to finish. I will definitely read the next book he writes.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|A little too oriented toward the business world when many other career choices are also affected.  But I couldn't put it down!  Good read!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|funny and very entertaining, definetly a chick flick, but, if you like Singing and choir music you won't be disappointed!
B004MC8CA2|1.0|This app didn't work for me. The need to sign in to use some of the features was a little ridiculous.
B000ICZD5M|4.0|Old, But, Futuristic Movie about a world ruled by a Family Kingdom,and how hard it was, and what it took, as well,the threats involved.<br />It is like nothing you have every seen, and quite advanced for the day it was produced. I liked it and have watched it many times over the Years.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Whether we're trying to talk our spouse into something or convince family, friends, coworkers, or clients, we all do some form of selling every day.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Dan Pink's book and think he does a great job explaining how &#34;sales&#34; is a bigger part of each of our lives that we probably realize. He then goes on to document how we can work on being more effective when trying to move and motivate others.<br /><br />I'm glad I bought this book as it's one that I'll definitely reference and read again in the future.
1451695195|5.0|Inspiring book with amazing grace. Believable. Gives you a feeling of peace. The author gives an amazing account of his journey between the here and now. Will read again.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Can't say enough about this book.  Once you pick it up, its very hard to put down.  Have recommended to many of my friends.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I am never disappointed by this author.  I could not put it down like all of her other books that I have read.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|There is just something about that man that is addictive.  The entire series is addictive.  Definitely worth watching.  A must see.
B000VM9Z8K|5.0|Kinsella always knows how to make me laugh!  Fun read and I love how she develops her characters.  Fun beach read.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Huh fetch chic xxx egg Gregg by rich buffoon king Seth hung fight hung Gobi Milo beef dad begging etc<br />DVD
B003Z0D4S2|5.0|There is never a dull moment!  Love this trilogy and author.  Lisbeth's character has no fear and will keep you reading.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|It keeps your interest and has alott of turns and twist.  I liked the part of the treasure and the island. John Corey is an interesting detective and how he goes about solving the case. Charlie
B003ZSISGM|5.0|I am sad to see this come to an end.  This was an excellent trilogy and I would definitely recommend.
B0054JELTI|1.0|It stalls my DVD blue ray player every single time I put it in. Sometimes it plays longer than others, but I will never get through the entire disk before it stalls. I have to physically unplug it to get anything working again. I have no problems with any of my other discs.
B003Z0D4SM|5.0|I absolutely loved these books.  I could not stop reading and even got my husband into them!  A must read!
B002ZG9774|5.0|Great colors, great sounds. You can appreciate the costumes and the actors/actresses voices.<br />Its great to receive 2 discs so that I can play the other one in places where there is no blue ray player.
B00ANAC32U|5.0|Excellent bumper even a little pricey. but much better than my Ringke Fusion Hybrid one that i ordered from amazon. It feels so good in the hand and the grippy part makes a hell of a job in preventing the phone from sliding out of your hands
B008J05EL8|1.0|Scam going on here - tried to unzip a file attachment, my Kindle HD immediately suggested this program as if it would do the trick.  So I stupidly bought it.  It is good for nothing!!!  Wasted $4.95 with no way of getting that money back, I tried.  Shame on me, don't make the same mistake I did.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Great Movie, I like because helps me to envision what the cost of salvation is in a world plagued of hatred. Delivered as promised, and reasonable price.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love his game. I play all the time. Its way better then temple run. My kitlle brothers love the game as well! I love it!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Best book I have read in a long time.  Well-developed characters , complex and at times heart wrenching, feel like I really cared what happened to them.  The language of flowers was new to me, the struggles of vulnerable individuals who both long for and fear connection is not new but written in a new way.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This is a great version of Pride and Prejudice. I love the whole movie. It is really long but funny and I have watched it several times. All of my friends have borrowed it and they have all liked it too! Great for a girl's night!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Too much rambling on insignificant characters and places....seemingly just to fill up pages. I personally am more interested in the Stark children.....some  wasn't even mentioned in this book.....and the families of the Seven Kingdoms.<br />The worst part is how long will it be before we get the next book.<br />Since it will be so long when the next book comes out....it would make more sense to put Family Trees in front of book,,,rather than in back. We will definitely need to be refreshed on who all the characters are.<br />Don't get me wrong.....love the series.
B00BHMF578|3.0|Nothing special. Typical Hollywood spin on real-world events. It's good acting if nothing else, and you won't be thinking &#34;gosh I hope this movie ends already&#34; so that's a bonus!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Recommended by a friend this book did not disappoint. Great book to keep you up at night because you can't put it down.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|Great graphics, FANTASTIC music, simple controls, and very challenging. Fairly easy at first (only going for the simplest goal), but going for the higher achievements (if I would call it that) is very, very difficult - this is one of the only apps that makes me want to finish other achievements past the basics. Good job!
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|The best thing about the movie was Philip Seymour Hoffman. I thought the relationship with the psychopath<br />was a little too dark. .But then, I wasn't there. I would like to have seen more on the techniques that LRH invented<br />and less on the Joaquin Phoenix character even though he played it well. His character was a little distracting from the actual story  as I would have seen it.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Good old space shooting that is kept very fun. The story line is hilarious (often comments on older styles of gaming story lines). The power ups make it even better.<br />It can be challenging if you want it to be - or it can be good and casual.<br /><br />Easily deserves 5 stars. One of my favorite apps!
B000067QMD|5.0|These snap right into place and keep a secure seal. I use wet erase markers to mark the date on top. A good investment for added convenience.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|One of the best seasons I've ever watched of any show. My favorite doctor plus good stories and excellent build up of a story line.
B001P06GX4|5.0|My six year old grandson loves it .  A great family game for different ages.  The stratagies will be a continuous learning process for him.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Basically as good as it gets for any tablet - Not perfect, but you're (most likely) not going to do some serious word processing that needs loads of extra features on your tablet anyway. Better than any other office suite I've tried for a tablet.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I heard of the book from my sister when she mentioned it was going to be a movie. So I downloaded it and thought it was quite good. It makes the possibility of a Zombie Apocalypse seem real! It's not silly like all the other zombie media out there.
B009JNXK88|2.0|It was good and fun. The music was fantastic (one of the best!). But, it didn't ever really get harder, and it was all about the same as the level before (just set up differently).<br />But then, after a while it decided to erase all of my progress (after completing a few &#34;worlds&#34;). I tried starting over, but it wouldn't save anything. Not worth it for me.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|DKG is one of my favorite historians to listen to in interviews, commentary during political events and reading her books on public figures.  The attention to detail and the research that has gone into these wonderful books is so deep and made me feel as I was transported back to that time in our history.  It is no wonder President Obama has invited her and other historians to the Oval Office to share the stories of these great figures in American history.  I felt like I knew Lincoln and all of his rivals personally, what a gift!  The enormity of Lincoln's heart and sense of fairness is so compelling.  I highly recommend this book to understand the enormous struggle and sacrifice the Civil War cost our nation but critical to the equality of human beings that must not be forgotten.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I saw this three times in the theater, twice in IMAX.  Never did that! Brilliant from start to finish. The best Bond film ever with best lead!  Imho
B005EGXNLS|4.0|Have read many of Corwell's books and this one is another excellent read following the tales about Utred of Bebbanburgh.<br />No writer surpasses Cornwell about fictional middle ages.
B000VXJMYG|5.0|This is one of the best groups I enjoy listening to when driving. Has been since ai first heard it.
B00BCOQSSQ|2.0|I have tried several times to get into this book but it can't hold my interest. It fluctuates between two worlds too much and the characters are hard to care about or define. I think I will keep working on it and maybe it will get more involving if I c an get  more pages read.  Just because it doesn't seem to work for me, doesn't mean that another reader won't like it a lot. So give it a read if it looks to be \\"up your ally\\".
0062101897|5.0|Any Harry Potter fan would love to read this immensely detailed and in-depth book!  This truly behind the scenes book details every step of the decision making process to make the films: story adaptation from JK Rowling's books, production, casting, set design and construction, costuming, special effects, etc.  Additionally there are tons of great stories and anecdotes by the stars of the films and you almost feel like you are on the movie set with them.  The book includes a large amount of pictures taking during filming that have never been seen before, sketches for costumes, buildings and scenes that did or didn't make it into the films, and more.  This book is essentially the encyclopedia of Harry Potter and is a must have for any collector.  It is also a great reference book for anyone interested in movie making and understanding the process it takes to make a feature film of this caliber.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I love these characters.  Dean is sullen and tortured and doesn't make bones about the simple enjoyment of a double decker bacon cheeseburger deluxe.  Sam is the epitome of the unintentional hero.  Always wanting a different life, always choosing to stay in the fight, always for Dean.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|Have tried this app a few times but not really one I use.  It might be great if you have small children to entertain but just not for me.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The only thing wrong with this series is that it is so short.  13 episodes are only enough to wet the appetite, then like those insatiable &#34;walkers&#34; you want more and more.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I got this for one of my husband's xmas gifts. Lots of people said good things about this movie, but it was not for me. Many story's details I wonder (why they do this?) that future people have less moral? Can't watch this with little kids (horror & violence scenes). CG is great though.
B0040I09RM|4.0|First, let me say that this was my first attempt at streaming video through Amazon Instant Video.  The Video quality was excellent, and the menu/interface was one of the best I've seen.<br /><br />The show itself is great.  I literally watched the first 3 episodes in a row, and only stopped there because I had to go to bed.  I can't wait to watch the rest of it.  It's fascinating. Great characters, great story, and of course, tons of action.
B008N9AASC|2.0|Beautiful nature and modern world imagery, but the mood of the movie and some of the scenes are disturbing. No clear theme either..
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Fun ...challenglng ...graphics are great. if you enjoy hidden object games this is one worth giving a shot. Truly enjoyed this game.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|It's a smash!  Already waiting for next season.  Excellent acting, wonderful backgrounds and great characters.  The Brits do these so well that it's impossible to compete with them.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|It takes a little time to get the hang of how it operates, but I'm getting it and it is definitely a great improvement.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Great plot, terrific acting.  John Goodman was so entertaining.  I heard this was based on a true story.  It was truly interesting.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|My granddaughter who is 3 loves this movie .  I watch it all the time with her and it has become my favorite disney movie.  We are both waiting for Mulan 2 to come out.  My grandson who is 10 loves to watch it with her.  He loves to ask me about the history of the Huns and the life of the Chinese people.  This movie is entertaining as well as educational.  This is byfar the best movie and worth the money.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|When I need to check my orders and I'm not near a computer this app helps. I even have made some orders and I have received the orders accurate and fast.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Hadn't heard of this before and was pleasantly surprised, although I like all the actors in this.  So wasn't suprised that I enjoyed it.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Keeps me busy when I am defragging my main computer. My reflexes are slow but improving playing this game. You have to quick with the eye-hand coordination.
1558216847|5.0|this is my favorite book. everyone should read it. I find it very humbling. . . . . . . .
0062014536|1.0|I read the first 2 books in this series and loved them. Reading this book at the beginning was good but the ending I was left wanting more. Nothing was resolved you don't know what happens to Lena or her love triangle.  You never find out the result of the resistance attack. The story was completely left  hanging. I was so disappointed that i regret reading it!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is totally beast! and I don't know about all those glitches on the kindle fire. I have the kindle fire and it works fine and is a lot of fun to play
0765325950|5.0|It's hard not to be a little emotional about this book. I started reading these books 18 years ago, and have only today finished this amazing journey. As a whole, the Wheel of Time is as engrossing a series of books as I have ever read. If you are not daunted by a lot of reading, this is as good as it gets.<br /><br />As for this final book, it really is an immense battle, played out over the course of hundreds of pages, including an almost 300 hundred pages long chapter. The final battle is grueling, heroic, disheartening and purely magic. At times you think everything is lost, other times it seems there's some hope ahead, and always you'll be hungering for more, for one more page, a further development. Some things are left unanswered, but you can't answer every question, as there is always a further one, but as a whole, taken as a complete package, this book delivers, in every possible way.<br /><br />Kudos to Brandon Sorenson for pulling it off an completing the saga. I could be mistaken, but I see more of Robert Jordan in this book than in the previous two, but still, you'll be hard pressed to find many faults in this book.<br /><br />Thank you Mr Jordan.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I chose this rating because there wasn't any higher one to give, because I would give it a hundred stars if I could!!!  I have read SO many other books with this same genre, lots of same storyline, just change the names books that always bring me back to the best :) I love Ana, Christian and the love they have for each other.  Each book is a new discovery, a new set back, a new joy.  I have lost count how many times I have read them, at least over 40 times!! I just don't think I will ever have my fill!!!  I would recommend this series to anyone who doesn't mind light BDSM, hot steamy, smouldering love scenes and a HEA that will knock your socks off ;)
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Wanted a useable basic app with a good key pad and got that plus more. The review feature is novel but maybe I'm just new to this arena.
B009JBZH54|5.0|5 discs of content including the special features discs, great deal! Incredible depth of covering how the movies are made really adds to your appreciation. More adult targeted than the earlier Batman movies, more depth to enjoy.
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|An insightful look into the minds of two young friends & lovers on their ultimately tragic journey. I laughed & cried but couldnt but help feeling overriding value of living as full a life as we possibly can. This book is originally written. My advice? Read it!
B0039208CG|5.0|Amazing to see the classic in BluRay, a really fun movie. Definitely worth owning this BluRay edition for Batman fans of the lighter and funnier side of the genre
B00136NUG6|5.0|great collection for the price. mostly hits, little filler, not for the completist or hard core fan but perfect for adding songs to party playlists etc
B000AAF1U4|5.0|Came brand new and in a good amount of time I love this movie from when I was a little kid
B0012GMUPE|5.0|i forgot how good this was, so good in fact, that it was not uncommon for people to think jazz rock/fusion could be a powerful and viable mainstream music force when this was in heavy radio rotation, as we all know, that didnt happen (who needs chops when you have autotune...)
B000059QYB|5.0|I had a copy of this earlier and it became damaged to have my &#34;Idol&#34; back in hand is a true treasure!
B004P8JPS6|5.0|A different take on a different storey.  Very well written and holds one's attention to the very end.  The author has the hero, Jack, depicted as a very tough but compassionate person.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Great storyline an interesting look at historic England and the dividion between classes, the difficulty with change and acceptance and the drama of individual lives brought into a complete story that has all you can ask for and certain things your didn'f want, but have to accept as part of the plot. recommend this for family and friends.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is truly an amazing book<br />I would definitely recommed it to others<br />It gives an excellent perspective of war from a soldier's eyes
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This story and its' many abundant characters kept us wanting more and more hoping it would never end. The time of English Superiority and classes is challenged by the stories and plots of this show. In addition the cast is brilliant in their portrayal of these dynamic charaters. The Earl, the help, the understanding at a time of Emglish pride and division of classes is a story that brings a lot to the table a must see for all fans of the british Cinema.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Love this cd. Lots of good music from new artist. I enjoyed watching the show and then listening to the music.
B007A2O3FO|4.0|The story was precious and the directing was magnificent. The mix of past and present and bringing all together to make this story extraordinary. I can't say much more without giving away the plot. A must see, a need see, a better see.
B008XX6J4C|4.0|I enjoyed the selections.  First time I had heard anything performed by this group.  Good &#34;driving&#34;  and &#34;power walking&#34; music.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Product is great, movie was so so.  Came recommended- if you like singing in movies then you will love this.....
1600242405|5.0|delightful in all aspects. I learned so much about the music that I have enjoyed for decades. Richards is the real driving force behind the success of the Rolling Stones. Should be required reading for rock bands.
B0091VTISO|4.0|Went in with low expectations and found the movie very enjoyable.  Lots of action.  I liked the fact that it didn't follow the Arnold version story, kind of like the remakes of Spiderman and The Hulk. Maybe I ranked it too high, but it deserves more than 3 stars.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Should be read by all married couples. Eye-opening and life- changing! Wish I would've read this at the beginning of my 20-year marriage.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was sweet loved it so much I could not get my hands off of it I brushed my teeth while reading it
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and believe that many teenagers will. The main character (Charlie) takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions through this story which he has told through letters.  I really loved this book, and believe anyone reading this should try it out!
0143106333|5.0|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is probably Roald Dahl's most famous book, though not everyone may know who it's by. It feels strange to reiterate the plot, but here it is. Little Charlie Bucket lives in a tiny house with his four grandparents and his mother and father. They're very poor, but Charlie manages to win the last Golden Ticket, allowing him to enter Willy Wonka's famous factory. He goes with his Grandpa Joe, and they see all sorts of strange and marvelous things. The other four children who come with him are all brats in one way or another: Augustus Gloop eats way too much, Violet Beauregarde chews way too much gum, Veruca Salt is a spoiled brat, plain and simple, and Mike Teavee is addicted to television. They are listed here in the order of their demise.<br /><br />Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is somewhat thought-provoking, but it's also marvelously imaginative. I would absolutely love to visit a chocolate factory one tenth as amazing as Wonka's. And who wouldn't want a life-time supply of candy?<br /><br />This book also features some great, well-drawn characters. I love Charlie, and the glutton, the gum-chewer, the brat, and the TV addict are all portrayed well. I loved this particular quote which illustrated Veruca Salt quite well: \\"'I don't care about that!' shouted Veruca. 'I want one. All I've got at home is two dogs and four cats and six bunny rabbits and two parakeets and three canaries and a green parrot and a turtle and bowl of goldfish and a cage of white mice and a silly old hamster! I want a squirrel!'\\" That's all? I'm surprised, Veruca.<br /><br />While the first movie version made of this book is good in terms of casting, it differs so, so, much from the original book. For example, the squirrels sorting good and bad walnuts are replaced in the movie by geese laying good and bad golden eggs. I have no idea where that came from. There's also an extra (and unnecessary in my opinion) plot-line added into the movie. Plus, the songs in the movie are not what the Oompa-Loompas sing in the book. The book's songs are much better, much more clever, in Roald Dahl's distinctive style. Though Gene Wilder is excellent as Willy Wonka. Oh, and they changed the title.<br /><br />If you've seen either of the two movie versions or you're planning to see them, I would recommend this excellent book.<br /><br />Lastly, I couldn't find a good picture of the edition I read anywhere; it was an old copy of either my dad or one of my uncles. But (and I'm very excited about this) it's the first paperback edition of the book! Who knows? It may be worth something. No picture of it though, just of another edition.<br /><br />Check out my blog, Cleo's Literary Reviews.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Great read! Was unable to put it down. Thank you Colleen Hoover for making me think about the possibilities in life: good and bad.
0307592731|3.0|A lot of other people have complained about this book having too much sex (it is certainly unnecessary) or embarrassing the world of hikers with her wretched preparation and personal misery along the trail. But what this book is really about is grief. Strayed's life was simply destroyed by the untimely death of her mother, and that's the real story. All of the lurid details about her adultery and drug use are the catalogue of how grief unglued her. The hike along the trail marked the end of the most debilitating of her grief, but it's really not much about that. Strayed is not the most insightful reflector on her own emotional reality, and there was some of the usual trite \\"I don't regret it because it's all made me who I am today\\" (as if that weren't a perfect tautology, and also perfectly true of absolutely everyone else, thus utterly insightful). For all that, besides the explicit look at grief and its consequences (hence my title \\"grief porn\\"--that's what the real genre of it is), it's an entertaining enough yarn.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book kept me on the edge the whole time.  Had a hard time putting it down.  What a great read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am totally addicted to this show, it's so good!  The storyline is wonderful, and watching the fashions, politics and societal change over the years is fascinating.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|It was a great book; it was exciting and kept you on the edge of your seat.  I have a lot of respect for Chris Kyle and the other soldiers that fight for our country and protect our freedom.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Good story! The story did raise my awareness of possible cyber attacks from a foreign nation or even from within.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The third wheel was an awesome book. Jeff Kinney is at it again.It was another winner just like all of the other books in the series.It was so good all I have to say is compliment after compliment after compliment.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not sorry I saw the movie first....But will read the other two books before seeing the movies....an easy read for anyone, I have them in my Kindle Prime....!!
B007RI56NY|5.0|It is awesome music written by an awesome band that is truly hysterical.  I love hearing their new songs and the classics.
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|The Bluray works great<br />i was a bit hesitant to purchase as i am in Australia and there is always the possibility that it wont work here but everything was fine.<br />There was a little hiccup with delivery but Amazon fixed it straight away when the first one got lost and resent another copy straight away<br />Thanks Amazon!
1401207529|5.0|Excellent artwork. Excellent story. The story flows well and tension filled.  Enjoyable and entertaining.  What more do you want from a comic book?  I have the hard cover deluxe edition that has many pages of additional artwork, sketches, pictures of scripts at the back of the book.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game.  The sound and it's different levels of play makes this game hard to put it down.  This game is easy to learn and play for young and mature players.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|My husband and I have really enjoyed this series. Hope they keep it going forever. Met all my expectations. Can't wait for season three on my DVR.
B008OOYALE|1.0|Cannot stand it, and how can I get it to stop popping up when I am playing bubble mania.  So aggravating.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Being a camper, hiker and horse rider - I loved the accounts of the author's experience on the Pacific Crest Trail. But even more than that was her confrontation with the emotional aspects of her life - so heart feltly and honestly told. The death of her mother and disintegration of the authors family and marriage. How she faced her grief and how she gradually found her path and her voice.  Couldn't put this book down. Lots of heart and humility and most of all the great adventure of someone who has the courage to face themselves. There is something about being alone in nature that is so powerful. There is the juxtaposition of no distraction from one's inner life - and the emotional welling up and confrontation with self - surrounded by the powerful peace and beauty of the natural world around us.<br />  Wonderful writer, story well told, and tons of honesty.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like the game, but it cheats.  It is hard to hit those little pigs with the hard hats on.
0385342063|5.0|Sophie Kinsella certainly has a way with quirky characters! I have read all of her books and enjoyed this one as well. I laughed along and shook my head from time to time, but fell in love with everyone and rooted for a great happy ending. Fun read for the beach, or light entertainment during the dreary winter months.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I truly love this games.  This is my favorite game, as I love all types of bubble games, but they do cheat.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Wish it adjusted time zone to the location you set under the weather settings.<br />Slick look.  Useful.  Easy to setup.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is so inspirational (the daily word), but I cannot get it to do bookmarks, or get on line with it.
B009G9Z08S|5.0|I have seen the previews and it was great. I would lover to see this in real moving theater with robin.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Liked it okay, but did not use it.  I like free stuff, and I just ignore ads anyway.  But it's okay.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I grew reading the kjv of the bible.  Preferred New International Vesion Though. Love the format for finding a particular scripture.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool i love it and its so funny when i get caught by the guard man cause the dog barks at me so funny i recommend that every one should play i give this a 5 star
B001ANSSDC|1.0|I have not seen the movie, but having reading the book, I can't imagine that it was up for best picture.  The book is extremely depressing, and I couldn't wait to get to the end to just be done with it.  The main character and his family are so messed up that they weren't even interesting.  The woman who becomes his &#34;silver lining&#34; is just as nutty.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I always love McEwan's writing, though Sweet Tooth is not my favorite. Maybe because he's writing from the view of a young woman & it seemed somewhat false. Good read, though.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|First off, I was really *really* excited to read this book.<br />Second, I know Oliver really didn't want to focus on the love-triangle..but as I was reading it felt like I was STARVING for it. At any mention of either of the boys, my interest would immediately spark.<br />Now, I did enjoy Oliver's writing. Very deep concepts, brutally honest emotions...but I just feel like it was incomplete. From a writer's perspective, I could see what her goal was.<br />-mild spoiler-<br />I mean, the whole tearing-down-the-wall escape-your-persecutions thing was touching. But it didn't exactly align with what the reader really needed...which was a conclusion! None of the storylines ended.<br />I was left with too many questions!<br />What happened to Hanna? Fred? Lena? Alex? Grace? Julian?<br />How did the government retaliate?<br />Did they win?<br />Maybe these questions were too hard to answer, and Oliver opted out. Which is fine I guess. But then it coud've just been the first book minus losing Alex, and be done with it. The ending kind of nullified the complexities I had always admired Oliver for.<br /><br />Complexities I had believe were worth 11 dollars.<br /><br />...Sigh.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this book, as I thought it would be childish or overly sweet or too much fantasy, but I fell in love with it.
B003M70O5O|5.0|I love this show I just wish season 5 was included in my prime. PromeTheus is very disappointing.if you could add it to be included with prime I will keep talking people I know into getting Amazon prime.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I hope there will always be one more book for me to read by Nicholas Sparks. They are all real and original. I have become friends with his characters and feel a loss when I turn the last page.
0756404738|4.0|This is a great follow up to the first in the series. The book starts with much the same feel as the first book. The only reason I feel it falls a little short is the somewhat abrupt change of writing style that takes the main character away from the university. Its as if the author was unsure as to how to transition out to the road. The story while he travels is also engaging and entertaining, but lacks some of the depth that made the first book so unique. Its as if the author made attempts to bow to some of his critics and speed up the pace of the story halfway through its telling. While this doesn't make this any less interesting as a story, it does have the effect of breaking some of the immersive ties that really bind you into the story and moves more towards a Harry Potter or youth story style. Which detracts from the depth and uniqueness of the story and makes it feel like more of your average fantasy story.
B000008M54|5.0|My copy of Fisherman's Blues was stolen out of my car at one point. Turns out I can't live without it and had to buy a new CD. I would download it, but this is one that I need to have a permanent copy of. In my opinion, this is the best album that the Waterboys ever released. If you like Irish influenced rock/folk music this is a must have.
075640407X|5.0|This is a fantastic book for avid readers. If your looking for a light quick read with tons of action or a Walmart thriller this isn't your tale. However, if you can appreciate a deep story with slowly developing characters then its a masterfully written book that will keep you wanting to read more. The syntax in incredible. It's written in a style somewhere between HG Wells and OS Card, giving lots of detailed descriptions of things without slowing the story. All in all its an engaging story that truly immerses you in a different world, but at the cost of a slow story pace.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Good game, entertaining, keeps me busy for hours. Not to mention how much my daughter loves it as well. Keeps her busy for hours as well. Plus who don't like the ice age movies. So u know the game is gonna be great too.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|There was not one thing about this that I did not like.  Brought out so many emotions while watching.  The actors are all so talented.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch Rapp at his best. This is one of Flynn's best and a real page turner. I had a hard time turning off the Kindle at night. It's that good!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed every minute .....!!  The performances were wonderful....felt as if I knew each one personally.....Can't remember the last time I enjoyed a show as much..
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Great adventure,great acting, magnificent cinematography.  James F. Cooper would be very proud that his famous novel was handled so well!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I personally enjoyed this book but it has mixed reviews in general. I loved the imagery. I felt swept away. A beautiful adult fairy tale and the first \\"romance\\" I have enjoyed in a while. I would recommend it to anyone who considers themselves a  dreamer.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|A great story turned into a really bad movie.  The play-within-a-play simply did not work and made it very confusing.
B008M7JODC|4.0|nice combination between character development and OK balance between short vs. long term plot (i.e., the challenge solved in one episode vs. the overarching storyline).  Personally I would prefer if the stories were tied together a little more with greater focus on the long range story.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|I'm a James Burke and Tommy Lee Jones fan who lives in South Louisiana so this movie was easy for me to like.
B00899F0G8|4.0|They have some pretty good writers on the series! I just wish I didn't have to wait a whole week before I can find out what happens next.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Love this game,graphics are good. Game never gets old. Have never had a problem with how the game works. Easy to use, you can play with kids.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I love jigsaw puzzles on my Kindle. But this app is by far the best. I like it better than any app that I have. I absolutely cannot put it down. Are there other apps out there like this one? Are there additional levels available? I am totally addicted!
B00A3T5CGU|1.0|I tried to load the program and I guess there wasn't enough memory or something because it wouldn't finish loading. Of course, I didn't get to use a partial program. This wasn't at all what I expected. My daughter has a cell phone that is a lot smaller than the kindle and it has a real nice gps map.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My friend showed me this game and I loved it. Works without internet access and helps time pass. Love the fact that upgrades are free and you have lots of bright and colorful designs for characters and boards,plus the realistic street design. Must have for any game lover.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|one of the cutest animated films I have seen in a while and would tell everyone I know to watch it
B008YRVW0I|1.0|Boring!!!!  Not worth it with all the other choices out there that are available to provide an enjoyable few hours.
B0099114WO|1.0|I thought this was going to be really really funny and found it to be rather very boring and more drama then comedy
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Perhaps the best 'tone' of any batman I've seen in years! I must of watched this 10 times already. (Then play some Arkham City )
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|worth every penny! great problem-solving hidden object game with engaging plot. I chose the &quot;normal&quot; option as opposed to the &quot;advanced&quot; and it was perfect to keep my &quot;detective work&quot; moving along. refreshing! gladly, 5 stars!
B001AW156U|1.0|Not sure if I got the crappy bootleg version but these here they look great but fall off with the slightest pressure. I feel like I've been ripped off.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|Just like I said, this movie pulls on your heart strings. Tragedy, sadness, but a happy ending. I thank Nicholas Sparks for writing such a wonderful novel which was adapted into this movie very well.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|The movie is based on the life of Mark O'Brien who was disabled from polio. To watch this man's incredibly touching, funny and so very &#34;human&#34; spirit is breathtaking. The cast is excellent. Everything about the movie is about 'life', about 'love' and about our connection to life. Not to be missed.
B00B2064IY|5.0|This album is so good. Of course it was recorded back when good music was being played on the radio. Not like some of the stuff I hear these days. Rest In Peace Jimi, and thank you for another buried treasure.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Outstanding program.  Safe for my young children to walk in on (&#34;mama and daddy are watching junk tv&#34;) because there is no nudity or violence or language.  Trust me.  Just watch it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game love the horse. in the game just great love it love it so real like its a must have app just love the game
B000QCS8TW|5.0|If you like a historical fantasy, then you will love this book. There where many times in this book where I thought I had it figured out, but was wrong.
0425263916|5.0|reflected in you is an amazing book, i read both Bared to you and Reflected in you three times. i could not get enough.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Watched it twice, I wish that HD rentals were 48 hours instead of 24 hours that would be my only complaint.
B000FC0OOU|3.0|A solid read and I enjoyed the book. I could tell how it was going to end from chapter one.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Never could get the game to run. Tried installing/loading three times and it never took. Too bad. It did look interesting.
B008D36INE|1.0|This film is dull dull dull, nothing happens worth noting, WHY, you might ask, would she love this CAD? Pass.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|Works great with no issues,able to access all areas of Facebook.i love all of the option to personalize your home page.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Well i'm old enough to remember all of this subject matter. I thought the flick was &#34;okay?&#34; Could have done more to reveal the American side and the turmoil in the country at this time?
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|pleasantly surprised, worth buying rather than renting.  I have heard mixed reviews from many but I liked it a lot.
B005QUQP76|4.0|I have been gaming on console for a while now, and just decided to build a computer just for gaming.  Everything on the mouse is great.  My only complaint is that the sniper button is too far forward for me to use.
B000063DI9|4.0|You know, I haven't always been so generous towards Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.  In fact 10 years ago I convinced myself it was a major letdown of an album.  I was young back then and preferred the more fierce, guitar riff-driven Iron Maiden of old.  However, time and a more open-minded and fresh outlook can change ones opinions, and with the understanding that this is a concept album (something I didn't know back in the day) with lyrics more creative than ever for the band, Seventh Son simply isn't meant to be taken as a strictly head-on heavy metal album.  It's an expeimental piece of heavy metal.<br /><br />With that said, I still can't get into a few songs.  I believe the title song does NOT deserve to be nearly 10 minutes in length when there's not really much of anything substantial taking place.  A short verse melody that's passable at best, a chorus that's really annoying (\\"Seventh son of a seventh SO-O-O-O-N!\\" and uninteresting atmosphere taking up most of the middle section, we have to wait a grand total of 7 minutes for the best part to come- that being, a REALLY good guitar solo.  It's honestly too long of a wait for a band capable of writing more coherent songs and albums.  I mean, can you name a single song from the first 6 Iron Maiden albums where you had to wait 7 minutes just for it to get going?<br /><br />Seventh Son of a Seventh Son seems to have a few noticeable flaws like these that occur from time to time, and I truly fail to see what makes the chorus to \\"Moonchild\\" anything special.  It's a bad impression (in my opinion) to open an album with a mid-tempo rocker.  \\"Can I Play With Madness\\" sounds like a poor generic Jon Anderson (from Yes fame) imitation.  Even worse, it sounds like the Big Generator-era Yes that was popular when Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was released which is a BAD thing.<br /><br />Even though I secretly desire for the album to rock as aggressively as the first 6 Iron Maiden albums (all classics in my opinion, and yes Caught Somewhere In Time *does* rock extremely hard contrary to what some people have been telling me) I can definitely make out a few classics worth noting such as \\"Infinite Dreams\\" with the best vocal melody on the album, the chugging nature of \\"The Prophecy\\" that blows me away with its medieval Wishbone Ash influences, and the \\"The Clairvoyant\\" is a major high point as well.  I also notice a more frantic and upbeat sound throughout the album that totally reminds me of Mega Man music (Nintendo games), haha.  Really cool stuff.  These moments usually occur in the guitar solos.  By the way, even though the guitar solos frequently take a back seat so the concept and lyrical portions of the album can be revealed, there's no denying that what guitar solos are here *are* really good.<br /><br />Sometimes the vocal melodies aren't always up to par, and the guitar riffs are quite often absent or simply less memorable than before, but Seventh Son of a Seventh Son ends up being a rewarding experience all the same.  I won't always be so forgiving towards Iron Maiden's weaker material in the future, but for this outing, it's worth recommending.
B009I2UH2W|2.0|The Griffin PowerJolt SE Coiled Lightning Car Charger for iPhone 5 seems to work OK charging an iPhone 5 - but the Lightning plug end is *much* larger than on the standard Apple Lightning cable or on several Belkin Lightning cables that I bought recently.<br /><br />It will not fit through the port hole on either of my iPhone 5 cases ([[ASIN:B0094CWZ7G Belkin Grip Candy Sheer Case/Cover For New Apple iPhone 5]] and [[ASIN:B0093IHVL6 Speck Products CandyShell Glossy Case for iPhone 5]]); it does work on my wife's [[ASIN:B00974L60S OtterBox Defender Series Case for iPhone 5]].<br /><br />Griffin Tech, please go back to the drawing board and come back with a Lightning plug that fits the majority of cases out there.  This one does not.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|App works well and provides great information in an easy to use format. Highly recommended even though the weather predictions are not always correct, nobody is ever correct about weather prediction.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|...and more variance as a result. This is a great read even if you have read the earlier ones, and i strongly recommend that you do so before digging into this book. I can't wait for the next one...
B003Y5USF0|2.0|I liked this movie back when it came out. Now many years later I must say the acting is so-so and the effects are... well...so-so.
0439023521|5.0|You dont want to miss this book.  I loved the movie but love the book, cant wait to read the next one.
B00AC8ZJPQ|3.0|Rented this for my son and I watched it with him. It was a pretty decent movie. The acting left something to be desired but you really won't care if your a Halo fan. The story was pretty good and the effects were okay. My son loved it and I enjoyed it too.
B00B2064IY|5.0|Really some of Jimi's best guitar work in this album, such a shame it took so long to be made public. If you're a Jimi fan, you have to get this.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Heard this album at my daughters when on holiday there, my husband thoroughly enjoyed it so when we returned to France we purchased it and listed on a regular basis, certainly we are both Adele converts.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this second book! Unexpected change of events, keeps you hooked. Can't wait to read the next book! Easy reading.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|such a good show! i cant stop watching! just as good as the first season! if you loved the first season, you're going to love this one too!
0425220931|5.0|Great, there is really passion in it!!!!<br />Love it, you will be there following Victor and apply concepts to your hole life
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Not only was the series good but the service I received was excellent.  I would definately do business with them again.  Thanks!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|A good movie for all ages.  Would recommend to anyone who loves clever characters and a clever story. Bring on the sequel!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I thought this was an amazing book. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story. The only problem is the agony I will have to endure waiting for the next book to be released
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Jurassic park builder is a fun game with good game. It has pretty good graphics. The downsides are that is slow going. It also appears to rely on social media and real money
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game..if you like horses. GET THIS GAME!!!!!!! Kinda hard to get diamonds though. But besides that. AWESOME GAME!!!!!!!!!! Great
B000000W5N|5.0|Bought this CD for one song basically but I like almost all the songs. &#34;Can't You Hear Me Knocking&#34; was the song I wanted & it really rocks!!  ;o)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this temple run two is WAY better than the original because it has better graphics and in the first one the whole terrain is flat and BORING!!! ;D
B00AU15HPC|5.0|If you ever listened to the Moody Blues and fell under the spell of the soft and the beautiful; then my good people you will more than appreciate the harmony's of Justin Hayward's perfect voice on this easy listening CD.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was totally captivated by this series.  Each frame is like a painting, the acting is stellar, and Maggie Smith--well it just doesn't get any better in my book.
0375847227|5.0|Wonderful story, loved the movie, and wanted to expand on the rest of the adventure, as there are to be no more movies made.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great! I love the monthly upgrades and different cities! I'm pretty addicted! If you want a great game to fill your time, this is it!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Too fast, boring, an ugly beast, just not my cup of tea, deleted it from my device Pro you can play it offline
B0063M22QO|1.0|I bought the Kindle version of Mahjongg and am unable to open it on my kindle.  Can you fix it?
0553382179|5.0|As funny as it may sound the information in this book has literally changed my life and those around me.  I was not a complete slob, but definitely have the whole Sidetracked Home Executive (SHE) brain.  Incorporating the information, routines, etc has made the storm in my brain calm down and I can actually focus on getting tasks done.  Most times much more efficiently and quickly than before. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and have given it as gifts to others.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this game is awesome. I get to finally play something that is not boating<br /> like some games.we get to choose our own character and run and stuff. you can play on Facebook too. (awesome!). this game rocks. I also like the fact that it changes its them. I liked the Christmas and the Easter in Rio.:)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is an amazing show. The actors are great and the story line is different than any other show I have watched. I can't wait to watch Season 3.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|Great Adventure!!  Not a good ending though.  I guess there will be a sequel. Tin Tin is a tough dude.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This game is fun - it worked fairly well for about a week, with the exception of a few freezes. Now it will not connect to Facebook at all. Boo! Please fix this app. My WiFi is excellent and my Kindle is new. It's on you.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|This was a great story line.  It had lots of drama, love, and action.  The movie had it all. I can watch it again.
B009GED3HS|5.0|HIMYM is a hilarious show, with a great plot and fabulous characters. The five friends are people that you come to care about and I am so glad that I found it!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|one of my all time favorite shows, reminds me of my two brothers.  so smart and funny, i've enjoyed every episode.
B0055XCDZ2|4.0|This show always keeps me on the edge of my seat! I love the sass and plot lines of all the characters. I definitely get frustrated with this show though, because sometimes I want some answers!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I enjoyed watching Downton Abbey Season 2.  The acting, the costumes and the scenery are all beautiful.  The characters are very likable and it is very easy to get into their characters.  Agreat way to spend time.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I love Downton Abbey. Great characters, intense plot, lovely design. However, the sadness in this season was something I was unprepared for and I kinda feel betrayed by the authors. Nevertheless, I'll be back for more.
B000NY12CI|5.0|If I could give this book 10 stars I would.  For anyone who is not familiar with fundamentalist Islam, which was me, the book is shocking.  I never knew!  Beyond that, Ayaan Ali's discovery of the World outside of Islam made me appreciate things perhaps I've taken for granted .... Things like the right to marry the man of my choice.  I have recommended this book to all my family and friends.  It truly is a must read.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|Leslie Nielsen was the main creative person in the movie FORBIDDEN PLANET. If only the gravity depiction was that of Kubrick's Space Odyssey, then our space program would be decades ahead of itself. Robbie Robot and his Robotic Car (first one of it's kind) stole the show, and I still wish that I had them both, as life sized working robotic devices.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really like Mahjong...I have played it for years, but now I can play on my Kendle Fire and don't have to sit at the computer to play...
B0060D08JO|5.0|I am trying to dump Amazon because of thew following reason;<br /><br />SECOND ATTEMPT: My Amazon Prime player does not play My Library movie any more and I want my Prime membership money refunded back to my MasterCard ending in 2558, and I want the money for TRON LEGACY refunded back to my MasterCard ending in 2558 BECAUSE THE PLAYER AT AMAZON FAILED TO OPERATE AS I WAS TOLD.<br /><br />I want to know who I can report this MOVIE PLAYER HACKING to other than the OCC. I am a senior with a disability and I need to have this problem looked  into. Don't I?<br /><br />The player you force me to use is defective and the movies you sold me for MY LIBRARY will not play without continual interruptions and weird messages.<br /><br />THIS IS BEING REPORTED AT FACEBOOK. I really enjoyed the underlying theme in TRON LEGACY that depicts a FATHER and a SON and a CREATED HELPER in a cyberspace Eden.<br />When it comes to what we purchase films for, we can't thank the Disney people. All they did was purchase rights to another movie.<br />Thank the Bridges family for their fervent creative work and motion picture excellence, demonstrated in this film and all of their films!<br />Thank Producer/Director, Lloyd Bridges for raising his kids to be effective, professional communicators, which they all are, now. Viva!
B007FEFLTO|3.0|The book is excellent; however, the presentation of the book on Kindle Fire lacked several pages which is very irritating.  No, I did not inadvertently fast forward as I rechecked.  The page would end in mid sentence and the next page made no sense.  I checked and several pages were missing.  For the price, I could have purchased the same book at Costco and had the entire text.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Love this show but don't subscribe to Showtime so instant videos are a nice alternative.  Great acting, interesting story line and who thought anyone would be cheering for a serial killer.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This review was very interesting and I'm very happy to take part. I'm very excited to have a copy of the bible on my mobile phone system.
B007BVOEPI|2.0|Too much violence, sex, and demeaning to women.  Realize it's about Middle Ages but  should be able to portray the era without so much brutal violence and sex.  Also thought it was somewhat predictable.  Will not watch the rest of the series.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app works great on my kindle and my phone! Easy to use and was to read!I would recommend this app to all my friends and family!!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|GREAT EFFECTS AND GOOD SOUNDTRACK.  THERE ARE A FEW 3D SHOTS THAT WILL ALMOST MAKE YOU MOVE OUT OF THE WAY.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN IN A WORLD OF OZ . IT TAKES PLACE IN THE WORLD OF OZ. THE FLYING MONKEYS WERE COOL.
B000021Y7Z|4.0|The movie of the concert is, I think, historic. I'm pleased to have it despite the videotape's rather steep price of around $36 (vs. the lower-priced DVD).
1451696191|5.0|I love this book. :) i recommend it to everyone! It came in good time too. :) :) :) read it!
B001AT4Y84|5.0|picks up sum years were part 2 left off great story great fx and is even funny at times for a new director to the trillogy he did a excellent job loved it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It easy to get lost in this book<br />Hard to put it down once you start reading it. Great book
B000QE1U9K|5.0|the whole cast is excellent actors weaver and dunton some of there best roles thay ever played i really loved this movie
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This is a very erotic book I found that I couldn't put it down was a little torn by the ending.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|i love the first book so much and the second book was not too bad either, but the third book was such a fail. it started out like it was going to be really good but i think it just fizzled. Like everyone has been saying the ending was horrible. there was no ending, it was left very open. i understand leaving open endings on some books but she didn't resolve anything. when i finished the last page i kept flipping the pages hoping i would at least find an epilogue somewhere to maybe jump ahead a year and explain missing details, but there was nothing. i wouldn't tell anyone not to read it because if you read the first two books of course you want to finish the series, but just so you know it will disappoint you in the end, and dont expect any answers to important details....<br /><br />**SPOILERS**<br /><br />ok i do actually think she made it out to lena choosing alex, am i wrong here? i know she left it super open-ended but she did state towards the end that she could never love julian as much as she loved alex and then they kissed sort of at the end so idk i at least feel like that question was answered by the way i interpreted it. i also do not like that they left hanna up in the air, did the bomb go off or not? did the jerk die or not? and tearing the walls down was not in anyway of them winning, im sorry but all they did was tear a wall down and beat some guards. what about the rest of the town? or the country for that matter? nobody left to join their side, no cureds* (spelling?) willingly left their lives and decided \\"yes this life makes so much more sense than ours\\". to sum it all up, im disappointed in the final book and wish it could of had the flow as the first book, which i loved so much.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved how the characters were so relatable. The storyline fell into place wonderfully. I did not want to put the book down. Perfect story for a rainy day!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great read, lots of twists to the story ....the ending left you hanging and wanting the next book.  Can't wait
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I read this however I didn't really understand some of the instructions and got some help from a friend who already had a Kindle book for sale.  I still highly recommend it.  Probably most people would understand it better than I did.
B008GVSOCQ|5.0|If you like romances, this is such a wonderful classic!  My family and I have enjoyed it over and over.
B0081336FO|5.0|I don't know how they came up with this version of Sherlock Holmes, but it's great!  Only one episode so far I didn't care for which was &#34;Hounds Of The Baskerville&#34;.  I like the original movies about this story best.  However it was very intriguing.  Another plus to this show is Benedict Cumberbatch is so handsome!  He's a superb actor.  If you're a Sherlock Holmes fan I highly recommend this PBS series.  I was surprised however, there was no explanation how the characters get in modern times and wondered if they just used the names they go by on the internet. Oh well, it doesn't make any difference. It's awesome all the same!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This series is quality.  The acting is superb!  The characters are inspiring!  I have re-watched years one and two and now will add year 3 to my collection.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I couldn't stop reading-this series is just so amazing! Can't wait to get started on the next book. Sad to hear it stops with four books, but I'm sure the finale is epic!
B009CGCQPU|5.0|Loved it.  Have watched it many, many times!<br />Great characters!  Oh, the marvelous Mr. Collins!  The dancing, costumes, and scenery is excellent.  You won't be dissappointed.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|I was surprised that people would say that Cornwell was being too formulaic with this installment and then harp on Sharpe. For me, I thought this had some interesting distinctions from other installments in the series. Also, I thought the Sharpe series in general was more formulaic that this series (not that I mean that as a slight).
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Amazing story by a true American hero. He was a great leader and protector both on and off the battlefield. Our nation is in debt to his family.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|awesome!!reminds me of mario!! i recommend!! the sounds and everything are a spin off of mario! cute game! well worth the download! !!!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I like the Fact that in this version of the Angry Birds game you are saving other birds instead of eggs
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love it!!! it remind me of a hand held calculator I needed it for the % key because the one on my phone didn't come with one!!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I loved this book. It kept me thinking the whole time. King at his best. Spins a wildly colorful tale.
030758836X|5.0|I have never read this author before but found this book to be a page turner that kept me guessing until the end.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|My great niece loves Tom....not as much as Ben...I don't know why....kids. they like what they like and that's all it is.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|just not a  book for me. i don't have anything againts the authors religious views but the way they were expressed rubbed me the wrong way
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|perfect~easy~convenient. very easy to use and access. this is an app you will reach for daily. would love to see different color options.
0312966199|5.0|I had to read this book for a book report. I am going to college to be a vet tech and this book I actually enjoyed reading.
1616550414|5.0|Any Zelda fan will love Hyrule Historia!! Amazing art!! And is a very high quality product, even with the low price! MEGARecommended!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  love all the different types of games. cant wait till I have enough money to buy all the games
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I liked the book very much and look forward to reading the rest of the series, why do I need more words.
B00BHMF578|3.0|The movie entertains but is both overdone in the drama and mostly unbelievable. When you read about the recorded events, the movie pales in comparison.  The story is more complicated and the movie compressed time, space and complexity into a simplistic  view. Hopefully this movie isn’t considered in any way a historically accurate representation.
B008M87GJK|5.0|The presentation and selection controls are superior to the PC website. You can select an article, read it and then select another without having to back up to home page. I wish it allowed for zooming the graphics, but that is only deficiency.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I like a prolonged saga which engulfs me in an alternative world.  It doesn't have to be great literature, and Fall of Giants by Ken Follett, certainly is not, but it has to be a good story, preferably historically grounded, with interesting and believable (if barely) characters.  Fall of Giants fits the bill.  Focusing on four families from England, America, Russia and Germany, with World War One, both before, during and after, as the setting, Follett cleverly makes the lives of his characters coalesce in a compelling story, good enough to make me immediately turn  to volume two of this trilogy, in order to find out what happens.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I received the product as expected and have watched a couple of the films.  Blu-ray visual and audio are great.  I look forward to watching these for a long time to come.  Would recommend to any Godfather fan.
B00683JK9K|5.0|I have this game on my tablet and can play it anywhere. I use the mode with the many small pieces. It works the brain but is also relaxing.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The graphics are very nicely done and the interactive features work well. I'm having as much fun if not more than one should expect from a free game. It gets a little choppy at times; but that's to be expected from such a graphics rich game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you don't have this game you really need to get it. It is the best game ever! I love the game because you can save your world. I have made 10 world's. You can name your world and it is so much fun. There is a bunch more bricks and you can get armor!
1400069807|1.0|add my name to the list of pissed off amazon customers who are dismayed at their greed. I will not buy this book or any other where the ebook price is higher than the hard copy. And shame on the author. I appreciate the difficulties making a living as an author but to rip off your customer base will not endear you to them. How about Amazon give up some of there profits back to the authors and not gouge their customers
B00BP4VPUE|2.0|Absolutely frustrating to see such inept fake FBI agents. Can't these people get anything right? The writers could make the least amount of effort to at least bring one decent agent to the cast.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Received as expected.  A great film, I can see why it one Oscar for best Picture.  Add it to your collection, worth watching more than once.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|I haven't bought a CD in years, but loved &#34;One more night&#34; so much that I had to buy this CD and I am glad I did.  I like most of the songs, maybe one that I don't like as much as the others but all in all I am Happy with this CD.  It was also downloaded to my cloud so I can put it on my MP3 player with out the hassle of downloading the CD and then dragging them on to it, that is a plus right there!!!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a really fun read.  Sweet, sexy, crazy and more.  Nothing deep but not totally predictable.  I recommend it.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I like that you can drag or tap the cards to move them. A little difficult to play on the small Kindle Fire screen.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Now I see what all the hype was about.  My wife and I kept hearing about this serie and then realized that we could watch it &#34;for free&#34; via our Amazon Prime account - what a deal!  We thoroughly enjoy it, easy to get hooked on the fascinating characters, historical/period details and great plotlines.
0143120255|1.0|I thought this was a book of writing. It is not. It is a book of bad art and one-liners. I am sending it back and am sorry I have to pay for shipping.<br /><br />If this is supposed to be hip, I'm out. What a waste.
B000NQRE1E|4.0|A great Blu-ray version of a classic film.  I enjoyed watching it again, glad I have added it to my collection.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great game and i really enjoy it. i dont like the fact that ads keep popping up in the middle of the game though. it is a bit annoying. maybe you could work on that.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|This book was a short, fun, and an amalgam of enjoyable scifi-a little bit Ender's Game, a little bit of Star Trek, and a little bit of old age novelty for those who have seen the far side of 40.
0714844659|4.0|I liked the \\"How to Boil an Egg - 2013\\" much more, however this could easily be a five star too!  I just read the 2nd book first!
B0094K1PW4|2.0|Lots of great ideas. Terrible follow thru. Sleeper with an even weaker ending. Better to watch some of Abrams' & Speilberg's good stuff and imagine them all meshed together in your head: E.T., The Goonies, and a dash of Lost.
B00BP2OO40|5.0|Great product! All the classic Halloween movies in one set, in excellent condition. Fantastic price. I would absolutely recommend this set.
B00AFEXRME|1.0|Having worked for the airlines for about 30 years, I can tell you that Flight is a terrible movie-laughable in spots and just plain dumb.  This is pure Hollywood fantasy. 1. Commercial Airplanes ( ie 717's or MD 80's)  do NOT fly inverted. Ridiculous.  2. Pilot unions do NOT enable drunk pilots- house them or pay for their highs.  3. Airline CEO's fire drunk pilots faster than a jet at VR.  3. If anyone suspects a pilot (or any crew member ) of drinking during the 8 hour \\"bottle to throttle\\" rule, EVERY time they land, (or even prior to take off)  they'll either pee in the cup or blow in the tube. 4. Once you are under an NTSB investigation you are literally locked away until they finish their questions.  5. The FAA in a situation like this is your WORST enemy and where were they in this movie? 6. If this guy is a drunk pilot who killed people, it's Federal..so the FBI gets involved, too.  7. Drug dealers do NOT have access to people under investigation in hospital rooms. 8. NTSB hearings are Federal hearings; there are no \\"objections\\" during hearings, especially by the pilot union. A lawyer can NOT get information disqualified ...totally stupid, inaccurate and typical Hollywood nonsense.  Who ever wrote this clap trap...next time write about what you KNOW.  It's bad- dumb and totally inaccurate movie, even the tower guys sounded like actors.<br /><br />This movie was so bad, I had to force myself to watch it to the end (a rent -thank heavens) .
B000FC12SM|5.0|I just can't say enough about this book! I love the simple comparisons and needed repetitions to help lock in these very true & basic concepts. Originally I was so focused on understanding the male part that it was many months before I read the female part. That was a mistake as I learned as much, if not more, from the introspection of my own gender. I return to buy this book year after year as I keep giving mine away to the newly married or those in rocky relationships. If it seems you just can't communicate with your partner DEFINITELY read this little book of great wisdom! It will change your life..
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|I can't say I'm a huge Boz Scaggs fan but over the years he has released the odd subdued soul/blues track that has really knocked me out. This new album contains mainly covers and was recorded at the late Willie Mitchell's Royal Studio in (you guessed it) Memphis and contains one Al Green cover \\"So Good To Be Here\\", as well as Tony Joe White's \\"Rainy Night In Georgia\\" in a similar Brook Benton-style. The Moments' \\"Love On A Two Way Street\\" and Tyrone Davis' \\"Can I Change My Mind,\\" are more smooth, sweet soul that isn't really to my taste and Steely Dan's \\"Pearl of the Quarter\\" is also delivered in the same style, with a nice Spooner Oldham piano break.<br /><br />More to my liking are two songs associated Willy DeVille, the bluesy rock of \\"Cadillac Walk\\" and the updated doo-wop of \\"Mixed Up, Shook Up Girl\\". Boz also covers the old folk blues \\"Corina, Corina\\" - there is no radical rearrangement here, it is delivered completely straight and is absolutely beautiful. \\"Dry Spell\\" is more blues, featuring Keb' Mo's slide resonator guitar and a nice Charlie Musselwhite harmonica solo, there's more blues on a very restrained reading of Jimmy Reed's \\"You Got Me Cryin'\\" with more harp from Charlie and some really nice lead guitar.<br /><br />Producer and drummer Steve Jordan gets a great sound on this album which pays tribute to the legacy of Willie Mitchell and while there was a bit too much smooth soul for me personally I have to admit that this is a really tasteful, professional piece of work by a classy artist and the superlative musicians he has assembled.
B00B1OWEVC|3.0|Kind of reminiscent of NIN's more noodly stuff, but with lush female vocals. Maybe I just wish NIN nails would put out new material. But trying to judge this independently as a \\"different band\\", I would say that I am not likely to purchase this album. Worth a listen on spotify as ambient background music while working, but not good for much else, IMO... Hoping T. Reznor's revamped NIN ensemble will put out new material!
B0027BOL4G|4.0|I think all should see this film.  Raised a farm girl and still living in the country, it is alarming and disturbing to see how mass manufacturing of food has evolved to what it is today.  It is even more alarming when big business interferes with those who want the freedom to provide more traditionally produced food products. Very concerning for the health and future of our land.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|WOW, reverting, insightful. A new approach to a story which isn't easy. I would have liked to see more insight into Peter's thinking, why he did the things he did. But Ender was a brilliant character.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|nothing new...easy read  characters and plot are typical romance story material...good reading for just before going to sleep...not too exciting
B009LDXQGW|5.0|I was real late preordering this last year but i knew i just couldnt pass up without supporting this man! Love his mixtapes & definitely loved his bonus tracks. I am not feeling his latest album Kiss Land as much though but will definitely get it to add to the collection.
B000WGUF98|5.0|Even in 1998, at age 73, B.B. King still had plenty left on which to run and plenty left to deliver. And, a surprise or two, namely producing the album himself. Mixing a few of his chestnuts---newcomers or latecomers can tell by the co-credits of the Bihari Brothers, using their pseudonyms Jules Taub, Joe Josea, and Sam Ling---with a few new B.B. King numbers, and playing strictly with his road band of the time, except for a few tasteful string arrangements, the order of the day was to keep it loose and keep it focused at once. And the King of the Blues does exactly that. In fact, on no few selections, notably &#34;Blues We Like&#34; and &#34;If That's It, I Quit,&#34; King stretches himself and his band out in ways he didn't always do in the studio. His trademark guitar sounds appropriately measured, stinging, and swinging in just the right places; his singing is as soulful as he'd delivered in a long time. B.B. King has made more polished records, before and after this one, but over a very long and distinguished career you'd be hard pressed to find many as baloney-proof as this one.
B007REV4YI|5.0|GREAT BOND MOVIE - MAYBE ONE OF THE BESTS - RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY - DANIEL CRAIG IS AWESOME - BUY IT!
B00AYLTMMM|5.0|I love this movie! As usual, I wanted to make sure I saw all the movies up for Academy Awards. At the last minute (Saturday before the big day) I watched Argo (not so much) and The Sessions. OMG! I watched it once and then watched it again a couple of hours later. Then I watched it again on Sunday. Then again on Monday. I will probably watch it again today now that I am thinking about it while writing this review.<br /><br />This is a sweet, lovely, funny, poignant, endearing story. It is a real story and is local and current for me. I lived in the Bay Area in the 1980's when Mark O'Brian (played convincingly by John Hawkes) was living in Berkeley and having this wonderful adventure. At the age of 38, this brave poet who lived motionless in an iron lung 20 hours per day with no ability to move any part of his body other than his head ... and, oh yeah, his penis ... decides that he wants to have sex. With the help of a sex therapist / surrogate played exquisitely by Helen Hunt, and his priest played hysterically by William Macy, Mark turns mission impossible into one of the most tender human connection ... and, yes ... even love stories. I laughed and I wept. Every time I watch this precious movie I see something new that cracks me up -- either in laughter or tears -- or both at the same time.<br />This movie is all about sex, but it is not titillating or kinky or an any way offensive. It is beautiful. Helen Hunt is the perfect Cheryl - lovely in every way. William Macy is the wild card -- what a perfect man to play the sincere yet sort of odd ball priest. I can't imagine what John Hawlkes had to do to be able to play Mark in such a believable way. Moon Bloodgood is magnificent as Vera, Mark's attendant during his poignant journey to &#34;full-blooded male homo sapianhood&#34;.
B000FA6720|5.0|This book was so touching and truly a mixture of kindred love souls...I enjoyed it immensely and recommend the reading of it...<br />It touched me so deeply that I cried.
B004CURZFC|4.0|This is a great movie.  I think it teaches some good values.  My grandchildren really liked it and so did I
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|By far one of the best books I have read. Had me from beginning to end.  Slammed and Point of Retreat are must reads also.
B003U53GK8|5.0|I never watch TV but after the 1st episode I watched all 120 some odd shows - Ready for season 7 :(
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A fun and Interesting Read. Kept me guessing as to who really did it. Really enjoyed the Book. Grisham hits another Home Run.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like that I can change the game easily.  It's a great game and easy to install and use.  And it was free!  What more could you ask for?
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This novel was gripping in all the right ways...especially emotionally & mentally.  The story of love found even in the darkest of circumstances was not only inspiring, but achingly true.  This is a novel to read over and over again.
B004EK91LQ|5.0|These movies are really fun to watch for the movie aspect as well as all the incredible dancing that goes on.
3836503050|5.0|elvgren was one of the prime practitioners of the art of pinup....prices for his originals is sky rocketing....and this book was only 10 bucks....such a deal.
B001RP1G0U|4.0|Good comedy and Story enjoyed it a lot. I really like both main actors a lot in this movie and story.
B004UFEJVW|5.0|I needed to purchase the Blue-ray form. The blue-ray dvd is more colorful and prevalent than dvd.  Either dvd or blue-ray, the movie is fantastic for all ages.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I always played on my xbox so I figured I should get it for my kindle. its amazing I love the game. it is slightly hard to control, but I still love playing it
0316224588|5.0|I sometimes wonder who reads these reviews and why.  Is it a person (like me) who has read every one of the previous books in this series?  Hardly.  I preordered \\"Standing...\\" from Amazon months before it was released.  Is it instead a person who is not familiar with Ian Rankin and/or has read none of the Rebus series?  Perhaps.  But that person should not buy this book.  Rather, a new reader should locate book one in the series and buy it used from Amazon.  Perhaps a better question is why people (including me) take the time to write these reviews?  To share our views, see our golden words in print, make deep philosophical observations about the human condition, or simply pass a little mental gas?  I think some of us just want to say welcome back John Rebus, Siobhan, and (even) Cafferty.  For us, a positive review is the second of two ways we can thank Ian Rankin for returning to the Rebus series.  The first, of course, was buying this book.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Very entertaining, I enjoyed sitting down to watch it. Althought I woulden't have spent anymore than I did to go see it.
0316224588|5.0|glad to see rebus back.  like this series better than his stand alone books.  the tv series is pretty good also
B004TI5N38|5.0|I have read numerous books by David Baldacci and they never fail to entertain me.  They hold your attention long into the night.  Good job.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for my soon-to-be teenage son. He couldn't put it down...  He is looking forward to reading the whole series!  Loved it, loved it, loved it...
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is awesome the first time I played it I could not stop if you play this game and listen to music at the same time it is cool. I love how there is a world tour there is new York Rio and Rome I think that is pretty cool.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|A very lovely love story that just happens to be true to history.  We need more historical movies to teach world history.
B003SHYVO8|5.0|These movies are really great, the dancing is incredible while still making it a fun movie to watch with friends.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I can't really add anything to what everyone already knows.  This is great television.  Plain and simple.  Get it and enjoy.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed this game :) the little monkey cracked me up and the puzzles were interesting. Looking forward to more games from this developer.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I like this game. The birds are real cute and each color does something different than the other. So you should learn that to start with. It can get a little frustrating when you get to higher levels but guess that's to be expected of any game. I played this on a 6 hour flight home and it kept me occupied part of the way.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead is So much more than a Zombie movie; its about leadership with manufactured apocalyptic conflicts that develops that character leaders.
B00003CX8N|5.0|Ann Bancroft is a favorite actress of mine.  This is a really sweet story that crosses the seas from the United States to England.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Incredibly funny movie, although I was dissapointed with how crude it was throughout. I wasn't expecting it to be that much.
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|I was a diehard Soilwork fan back in the day, but lost them in the past 6 or 7 years.  I think what I liked about them was their perfect mix of brutality, musicianship, and mixed clean/growling vocals.  What made me lose interest recently was their overproduction of recent albums, and almost \\"caricature sound\\" of their old stuff.<br /><br />Maybe it's inspiration from their new guitarist or something, but this album seems more sincere and fresh.  They also seem to be experimenting with other sounds.  I swear I hear some Opeth in there sometimes, along with some references to classic metal here and there.  A majority of the tracks are listeners.  I've only listened to the whole thing 1.5 times, but I suspect that in the future I won't be skipping too many of the tracks.<br /><br />EDIT (2014-01-09):  I can't believe it has been almost a year!  I have to say that:<br /><br />1) I still have this on my rotation.<br />2) I am genuinely happy when this album comes up on rotation.<br />3) The music on this album feels really inspired.
B007FJFDXS|2.0|You might like it but it just didn't work well with my brain. It reminded me of early 3D in Sega where I just kept walking off cliffs.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I'm no history professor, but where's the rest of the story?  It focuses on the Hollywood portion of the story, with the happy-ish ending.  I'm growing weary on these microscopic carve-outs of history.  However, this little known story is very interesting, kind of suspenseful, but not as intense as I have heard. The acting was excellent, and they did a great job of recreating the era, right down to the filming style.  Great actors, all... well almost.  I really appreciate Affleck's movies, and believe him to be a better director than actor.  If you are trying to decide if you should rent this -- do so absolutely.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I have yet to experience a &#34;Jewels&#34; game that I did not enjoy, and find challenging.  This one is on a par with the best.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Keeps reeling you in until the very end. Liam Neeson was impressive as always. Plenty of action as well as drama and suspense.
0062103377|5.0|Gave it as a gift to one of my Supernatural obsessed friends. She was really excited about it and loves to read through it.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was a nice novel, I liked. Interesting drama. They found each other on a weird situation. I recommend it
B005DNBDXM|4.0|This is my favorite of Hollywoods Asteroid disaster movies. This scenario needs to be researched more and more as information becomes available. An asteroid hitting the planet cannot b ruled out at all!!
B00B49L7JY|5.0|For music lovers, this movie is a must see.  You will find yourself Googling &#34;Rodriguez&#34; and downloading some music.  He has a very cool sound; reminds me of Bob Dylan, mainly because of the era, but is a much better singer.  I like to think that Dylan would agree.  If you don't know the story, do yourself a favor and watch this film before learning anything about the man.  You will be on the edge of your seat.
B004BRP7R4|5.0|As always, Josh Groban is an amazingly talented artist.<br />He brings true meaning to the word talent by adding his<br />own touches of soul.
