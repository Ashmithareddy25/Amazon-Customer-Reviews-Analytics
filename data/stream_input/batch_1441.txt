B007KQ6XYY|4.0|ok so some of you are total winer's because 1. this game is very fun. 2. you can just delete it if you want to just go on the caricel and holds it down and you get the option to delete it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I can't believe it's finally here for my kindle fire! I love it! just like someone said earlier, for the next update, I wish there were notifications so I know when it's my turn to go. also, I wish there was a way to purchase color  packs in the store section in addition to buying bombs instead of just buying color packs when you are drawing for someone else.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Lots of fun, easy to use,  and it's free!  Like the option of having the cards automatically be removed if you know you have won. Gives you more time to play AGAIN!
B00125WAWS|5.0|What an inspiring story.  Enjoyed the acting and the story.  This was a story that I was not familiar with.
B007FH9GT2|3.0|I love that Fincher included MANY elements from the novel that the Swedish film left out - Mikael's relationship with his daughter, Lisbeth's crew of hackers in Great Britain, her disappointment with Mikael & Erika; but, I was surprised at the trite 'American' stereotyping slipped in - Burhman portrayed as boyishly fat and so 'merely' a lustful opportunist in his sexuality rather than an abusive sadist. Still, I appreciated Fincher making his point of view brilliantly clear, in chrome, and his use of sound particularly with the dinner scene in Martin Vanger's home.  Also loved Daniel Craig's humor. I rented to see the opening credits and the Hollywood gloss over of architectural eye candy. Also hoped the home viewing would help me appreciate Rooney Mara's portrayal enough to see the next Fincher installment for the price of a theater ticket. Much more satisfying with a remote control in hand.
B0017I1FP8|1.0|James Newton Howard is brilliant. Why he had to collaborate with Hanz Zimmer, the most overrated hack in history, is a bigger mystery to me than crib death.<br /><br />Let me summarize the entire score in the following way:  nuh nuh nuh nuh. nuh nuh nuh. nuh nuh nuh.<br /><br />If only we could sign on Danny Elfman, John Williams or resurrect Bernard Herrmann and Jerry Goldsmith for the next feature, we'd be fine.<br /><br />Let the hate mail begin.

B004MC0FO8|5.0|Shazam is a great app and can be really useful if you want to purchase a song you hear on the radio or on TV.  Just activate it will record about 10 seconds of the song and tell you what it is and how to get it.  You can go directly to purchasing the song from the app.  I have bought several songs after Shazaming them.
B000B589JI|3.0|The size of this is just big enough that I wouldn't want it permanently hanging on my keyring, so the issue of the split ring does not concern me personally. Most dedicated Zippo users make sure that they fuel their lighters regularly. It's something that becomes a habit. Newer users who get their first Zippo while putting the butane lighter in the drawer may find re-fuelling their lighter more often a relative pain, but they soon come around once they start to prefer a Zippo to a bit of cheap plastic. Now, that being said there are occasions where having a handy quick fill option might be needed, i.e. weekends away for whatever reason etc. That is where this canister comes into it's own. Not only will it refill your Zippo but will hold a couple of spare flints and has a handy tool to unscrew the flint screw in the bottom, (just in case you don't have a dime handy), and it also gives a little peace of mind, knowing that you won't have to use a pack of matches until you get home.<br /><br />OK, now the glitch. Far more serious than the split ring. It leaks. Uh Oh! Doesn't that kinda defeat the purpose? Well yes. Now I note that not everyone had this leaking problem so after a little investigation I think I managed to work out that it's simply a quality control problem. The nozzle that you expose to actually pour fuel into your Zippo, seals just fine. The leak comes from where the main body of the canister screws into the \\"head\\" section. Inside the head section is a flat rubber washer. The main body should seal against this as it is screwed in tightly but on the one that I got either the threads are fractionally too short, or the washer is fractionally too thin. Either way there isn't an effective seal even if you screw the body in as tight as it will go. I fixed this by taking a used sports ticket of thin card, (Predators hockey actually ;) ), and drew around the rubber washer and basically cut out 2 thin card washers the same size as the rubber one. I then just put those behind the rubber washer, refilled the canister, screwed it in and I immediately felt the difference as the body reached the rubber washer and I then gave that extra tweak to tighten, making the seal. I shook that thing violently, turning it upside down, throwing it up and letting it fall into my lap. No leak. I checked after a couple of days and saw that the level of fuel inside had not reduced so my \\"thin card mod\\" worked. I'll keep an eye out for a slightly thicker rubber washer to replace the original and my card, but in the meantime it now works as it should. Why they don't supply that thicker washer is beyond me. I mean, those 2 layers of card are still much less than 1mm thick and made a useless concept a great one. Just give us a thicker rubber washer please Zippo!<br /><br />So, even though I love the concept and I like my canister, and it now does what it is supposed to, the product supplied was effectively useless without some form of modification. Not everyone is going to want to do this. No-one SHOULD HAVE to do this. If the washer made a good seal this gets 5 stars, but because it leaks, (the worst fault a fuel canister can have), 2 stars got deducted. It kept the other 3 because the product can be made to work with the modification.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />I meant to do this months ago but forgot.<br />Regarding the \\"modification\\" of the washer, soon after writing the above review I happened to be replacing a bathroom tap set on the wash basin. I discovered that tap washers are the EXACT same diameter as the washer in the Zippo cannister. They are also a little bit thicker. So, Simply get yourself a tap washer and replace. No need for thin card cut outs.

B006KX3GXO|1.0|I downloades this for the kindle fire and it wouldn't open my pictures!!! I was truly dissapointed I need something to edit my photos in :-(
B0055SWM08|5.0|Beautiful game with beautiful music. I don't know what more you could ask for in a game. If you enjoy puzzle games, this is one for you.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is full of sex and s&m... but that's about it. I am sorry but the characters and story line are one dimentional and unfortunatly flat. The book ends oddly and it makes me believe the author just wanted to sell another book. Seen it all before... So if you like reading dont subject yourself to this. If you are new to reading... then enjoy.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|awesome app it is very addictive. need to fix update box it will tell u there is an update and there's not
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun game that involves a lot of busy work and interaction that keeps the little one occupied. had fun with hatching eggs and the collections
B005G5PPGS|5.0|I bought this book because it was the Kindle Deal of the Day.  I like sports, I like books, so I figured what the heck.  Wow, was I missing out on a great story for years and years... Moneyball was an excellent book.  As an engineer, there is a lot of information there that I could really relate to.  Michael Lewis does a great job of setting the stage with Billy Beane's career (or lack thereof) and then explaining how the standard baseball scouting could be wrong and continues to explain how statistics could be a great tool for a team's front office.  This is probably the most enjoyable book I have read in the past year (and I average a few a month).  Thank goodness I took a flyer on the Amazon deal of the day.
1466401885|5.0|This was one of the most amazing books I have ever read....I have read it multiple times! I recommend it to everyone. You will not regret it
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I cant believe its true!!! Now i can stop using my slow droid phone!<br />I will play with anyone!! search for me!!<br />Username: MyNameIsMonique
0802473156|5.0|Excellent and amazing book that help you understand your marriage. Very true all what Dr. Chapman explains, and the experiments he gave out to his patients. I really enjoyed it so much this book!! It was awsome!!! I really loved it!!!!!!!! It is 10 thousand times worth it!!!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is ok but there is a lot of adds which keep you from playing. also its actually very slow
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I really have no complaints about this bag, other than there's no where to put a hydration pack in it, and you can't fit anything extra, like a jacket, food, or other necessities you might need when out on a hike. I had to hook my jacket to the outside of the pack with the straps. I was wearing my raincoat and if I'd have needed to put the jacket back on, it would've been wet. So really, if you're looking for something that can hold your camera gear, and other non-camera gear as well, you might consider a more pricey bag.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty good games, some are sort of stupid though. overall very fun. There are a few games that I have not been able to beat but its worth trying.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I am a die hard fan of ERB and more specifically John Carter.  I have read and reread these books  so often that I should be able to recite them line by line.  I was naturally skeptical when I heard they were making a movie based on the John Carter series.  But there was nothing that was going to stop me from seeing it.  To my amazement the movie was awesome. I think I must have floated out of that theater.  Then I started reading the reviews.  I have to be honest I started thinking I must be on Mars.  What I was reading in the reviews had nothing to do with the movie I had seen.  The people who wrote the reviews had to have seen another movie, surely.  The only thing I can think of is those critics hate Disney and wanted the movie to fail, it is the only thing that makes sense.  This movie is great!  If you like SciFi you have to see this movie and try to see it the first time on a big screen.  We not only need a need a new government but new critics as well.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game so much!! very funny and easy to understand. everyone should give this a try! I guarantee you will find it fun! play against friends or random people. good stuff! :-)
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|The book is read as if you're having a discussion over a beer with a friend. Love the no-BS tone. These guys have built a legit company, and have done it using a few unconventional tactics. Might not work for all companies, but it's a great story. Easy read. Entertaining. Readily applicable. Unique. 5 stars and worth a read.
B0053KWDES|5.0|If you are in need of a sub $100 amp look no further!<br /><br />As I write this review, I am listening to my AKG Q701's at around 5/10 volume and they are at a fairly loud volume. Anyone familiar with these cans will know how difficult they are to drive and this little amp does it flawlessly. My sennheiser hd 650s and denon D2000s are easily powered as well. It is really surprising that this is all accomplished with a cell phone battery that costs 10 dollars to replace. Not only is the e11 powerful, but it is quite neutral which is very desirable. The bass boost is also a welcome and effective feature. To find something more powerful or more detailed would require the ray samuels sr71 or the pico slim and both are at least 4 to 5 times as expensive.<br /><br />Bottom line: Unless you plan on walking around with planar magnetic headphones, there is no other headphone amp that can match the value and performance of this little guy.
B000DZG3Y4|5.0|This is the unabridged 1945 Hardcover (cloth) Book Club edition - which means it's just as great as it should be, since it IS Pride & Prejudice, but also that the book club-iness makes it not as valuable as it looks.  This version has full page colored pictures of the characters through-out, and has that traditional deckled edge (uneven cut pages - makes it easier to turn pages imho).<br /><br />The book is a cute love-story about Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy set in that classic early 1800's English period where manners and one's dictated social existence means far more than independence and general happiness.  You HAVE to take into the account the current society of the time period / location to understand the predicaments.  The story is witty, albeit wordy but still very enjoyable even after ~200+ years.<br /><br />THIS is the version I was looking for, hard cover, ancient looking and good quality!  Perfect for my personal PHYSICAL library!  I have the Kindle version and yes, that comes with a huge amount of spelling errors and paragraphs broken up mid-sentence.  BUT the Kindle edition is FREE a good deal of the time so you end up getting what you paid for... ;)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I really wanted to like this one...but I was so disappointed! I enjoy erotic romance and Ive read some very good books in that genre.This was nowhere near good!I disliked all of the characters. I was constantly pulled out of the story by the words that that the characters used when speaking, noone talks like that! Overall the writing just seemed elementary. I struggled to finish it and basically feel it was just a waste money.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|takes me back in time but with new twists. I missed the old game so it is nice to see this.
B000XR4OC0|5.0|When I got my first pair as a gift, I thought they were too small.  My toe went straight to the end.  I called two different retailers, and they both immediately began to ask me a few questions, and I am glad they did!  These shoes are not made to fit like the shoes we are used to in the US.  Both retailers (who sell a LOT of these shoes) said that my toe should go to the end.  They said the shoe should fit snug, like a sock.  They both told me the shoes stretch and will mold to my feet, and if I go up a half size, I will be very disappointed, as the shoes will slip off in the heel.  I am GLAD I listened, as these are now my most favorite shoes.  I know several people that own them, and all of us agree they hold up very well, are very comfortable, and are well made.  They do stretch and they mold to your foot. I wear mine without socks, or with no-show socks.  I suggest trying them on however you plan to wear them, as socks do take a little room, and if you know you will ALWAYS wear them with socks, you may want to think about going up a half size. I will buy more, and what makes it even better is I am helping a better cause that puts these shoes on the feet of those that need them more than me.
0439023491|3.0|Second in series depends on reader being very familiar with first book. That was okay for me since I recently read The Hunger Games; however, from a purist's point of view, a book should be written to be a self-contained whole even when part of a series.  The action is solid and new characters interesting. Strong heroine. Final scene is literally deus ex machina. Not my favorite when to end a story.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Wow just wow! That was an amazing book. Incredibly well written. Intense, emotionally gripping story. Gideon and Eva and Cary too. Wow, it's going to be a tough wait for the next one Ms. Day.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Amazing story..was so glad I bought the Trilogy so the next book was there as soon as I finished the one before it. Couldn't stop reading this set!
B004SYP5WC|5.0|This app is very helpful, as well as extremely easy to use. I am glad I downloaded it. I usually am pretty good about paying my bills but sometimes one may get forgotten. Thanks to bills reminder I don't have to worry about forgetting to pay a bill.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i love this game! you start off with a few games and you have to &quot;complete&quot; the games to get more points and wih those points you can unlock new games
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game! it allows for hours of fun!! It is addictive and fun for long trips!! I reccomend this game for anyone looking to pass time and enjoy themselves
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great combination of challenging puzzles and relaxing music.  Quiet,  inspiring,  and fun. You will come back to it repeatedly to get perfect scores on all levels. Improves your creative thinking.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is Awsome it's like 100 games all in one it's toatlly wicked I really love it so much. I WANT TO WARSHIP IT.
0345803485|1.0|I'm sorry. I tried really hard but this book is BORING. The main characters are lifeless and have no tangible connection.  Beats me why this book made it into the top 100, but kudos to whoever made it happen: the story certainly didn't.  I paid good money for this novel but I can't be bothered reading further. In comparison, I just paid $2.99 for an indie novel, I couldn't wait to get back to every night. I have never written a review and given a 1 star rating before but this book deserves it. What makes this book so bad? Well, even though it is written in first person POV the reader just doesn't \\"connect\\" with the heroine. Yeah, Yeah, I know we are not all into BDSM. But I can appreciate a good sex scene as well as a good romance scene, and to quote a scene from another GREAT novel, \\"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.\\" The heroine really is \\"vanilla\\".
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|great app so glad its on kindle fire now :) yay u get to use it with ur facebook friends and it def. does not get boring
B0055SWM08|4.0|This is a relaxing game played in the restful mode.  I have not tried the timed mode, but I do think the game is a good value.  I am not a gamer, I enjoy thinking and logic games more than action games .  This is a good game for me.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|101 and one games in one is a fun game to play. it is also difficult at times but it is really great
B007JZGIMS|1.0|Purchased the unlocker and now the app force closes before you can select an artist!! Keep the free version its still good I believe.
0307719774|5.0|I just received my journal today and I think it's the perfect size for me. I am a woman with medium/average sized hands. While reading other reviews I had concerns that the book might be tightly bound but that wasn't the case. I cracked open the book and fanned through the pages. The binding looks solid and held up to my initial abuse. After fanning through the pages, the books will be as flat as possible for a hardcover book.<br /><br />I can't wait to get started. This was what I needed since I would start a new journal and stop writing after a few entries. I like the questions at the top of the page to get my thoughts and ideas going. Really great feature! I'll update this review if something happens to the book in the future. For now, I'll just keep smiling at my new purchase.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. It is so nice to be able to have access to the Bible anytime I need it.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I started running at 61 just to get back in shape. My cardiologist. (who ran in the Boston Marathon) prescribed this book at my two year followup to heart surgery. Born to Run is both interesting and motivational. I will never run an ultra marathon but I know I feel better about running knowing my body was made for it!
B007VGXS8M|1.0|The app ran okay, then it Massively crashed my Fire - I had to wait a day for the blackscreen of death to clear. I uninstalled right away.
B002ZG997C|4.0|I went to see this movie, not really knowing what it was about, and boy was I in for a surprise!!<br /><br />Denzel Washington is always great in whatever role he comes out, but playing the ultra-violent Eli, living in an ultra-violent world, well, you can just imagine what you will see if you watch this.<br /><br />This is one film I DON'T recommend you watch with your kids.  I know it has a religious message, but overall, the content should be restricted to adults.  There is no soft-core porn or anything, but some of the subject matter could traumatize a young kid, and why would you do that to them?<br /><br />Other than that, a great movie!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I liked to books and think they are accessible for audiences of all ages. There is also an interesting moral commentary on how societies are structured to exploit some at the benefit of others, with parallel commentary themes on media, message framing, and selling ones story in order to reach and influence others. There is a good amount of violence and the story gets gradually darker as it progresses through the trilogy, so reading it to younger children should be done with discretion and a good deal of preparation, or not done at all. Older kids and teens would enjoy it and could learn from the deep issues and themes that the trilogy addresses.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I'm so happy to have this game! I always wanted to play it and now I can thank you so much!!!!!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this is a fun game.  it is pretty fast paced so no waiting very long for things to grow etc.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|With this app. I can create a picures that my friends wow about. It's totally awesome :p I love it! you can make a picture look hand drawn or a perfestionals jobs. a lot of help with scrap books and cards
B005MYEPXC|5.0|This was my favorite movie of 2011.  The story is charming and the city looks even better in the movie than in real life (although it looks really nice in real life also).  Woody Allen filmed this flick with a \\"warm\\" tone to the cinematography and it does wonders to enhance the mood.  I rented this from Netflix, saw it twice then, and decided to buy it for the future.  Shows great on Blu-ray.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really like this game haven't been able to put it down. I just wish there were better way to earn energy. Always running out and have to wait for energy to recharge. Other then that I love this game.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I bought this app in the first week after getting my Kindle Fire.  I really enjoy it!  Mahjong is one of those games that can be played by young and not-so-young, and each of my family members enjoys sitting next to me hunting for matches.  This game is a great distraction when life gets hectic.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|Ive always enjoyed the PBS versions of these stories. It's good to read them and hear it from Watson's point of view.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies to watch, I wish Disney would do a sequel. The Blu-Ray version is incredible.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Wtf? I review draw something and it appears on angry birds rio¿?????!????!!!!!! Stupid! I don't even own this game on an android. Device!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|everybody this game is so awesome its 101 games in 1 for free this game is the best game on the store
B007Q476KU|5.0|I love movies like this. I mean it has a great story line. I reminded me of Black Beauty. Yes it is slow a bit, but its showing you what is happening. It was trying to make it feel somewhat realistic. And to people who think that the horse wouldnt have made it through with the wires then your just mean. Horses are strong and being an owner of horses it shows you that they are strong willed just like you and me.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is very good. its keeps me occupied in my down time although you run out of energy quick its still fun.

B006KX3GXO|3.0|GREAT APP FOR MY SAMSUNG PHONE. FOUND IT ON MY KINDLE FIRE DOWNLOADED THE APP AND COULD'NT UPLOAD PHOTOS TO BEGIN ENJOYING THIS COOL APPLICATION.....PLEASE FIX!)
B001QBC4AG|3.0|Boy, I have no complaints about the selection and abundance of material here. Who could ask for more? There is one rather big thing wrong with it: the sound on the mono edition. It was not mastered with the greatest of care as there is a considerable amount of `rumble' and bass thumping. However, I re-dubbed it using an equalizer (on to normal bias cassette for authenticity sake) and got all of that noise out. It sounded so authentic, it would get you flashbacks to an old record player. Perfect. It was the best thing I've heard in a while.....
B007SYWFRM|4.0|it is a very entertaining game to have and play when you are in that boring moment its a great game.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|Wow, it seems all cool, but you need Email or Facebook. If you don't have these, don't get it. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star, is because, really, I haven't played.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I had draw something side loaded onto my Kindle for a couple of months. I am so glad to now have the official app- it looks great.
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|I caught up with Gotye after watching the Glee episode that featured \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\". I don't watch that show, ever, but that night I did only because of that week's guest star appearance by Matt Bomer. Shortly after that episode I went on YouTube to find the original version. That song and its video are fantastic but I fell in love more so with ALL of his other work. Eyes Wide Open, In Your Light, Heart's a Mess, Easy Way Out, and Night Drive are on the top of my \\"love\\" list. His music is refreshingly original (try State of the Art). With all the layers of sound in each song it's amazing how your ear picks up on different parts each and every time you listen. Take a look at his \\"Making Making Mirrors\\" documentary as well as it showcases, in a very humble way, his extensive instrumental abilities, creative talent, and warm personality. He is an impressive artist that stands out in stark contrast to the auto tuned club beat driven lyrically lacking fluff that dominates the airwaves today. It's fantastic that \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\" is all over the radio, I just hope that his next song release is given as much air time to further expose the American masses to his high quality work. I am now and always will be in awe of the ever so talented Gotye (aka Wally De Backer)!
159562015X|4.0|By purchasing Strengths Finder 2.0, particularly purchasing a used copy, one can determine their type in a cost effective manner.  I was initially a skeptic, but after taking it have become a proponent of the instrument.  Based on a positive psychology perspective, taking and applying the Strengths Finder can help you understand where you shine, how to make the best of your areas of strength, and how to be most effective in a wide variety of work and life settings.  As one learns more about this instrument, one can learn how to function effectively with others in the workplace, and in a variety of interpersonal situations.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|this is by far one of the best books i have read in a while. i will admit that i was a bit hesitant to read due to bad reviews but i am glad i didnt listen. i was also a bi skeptical of their bdsm relationship but found the book very intriguing. i love the characters and cannot wait to begin the second book.  read and enjoy!!!!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|great and addictive game. my only complaint is that it lost some of my level ups for my soldiers when i logged on today. I'd give it five stars otherwise
B004EPZ07U|5.0|Idk why people gave this movie such bad reviews, It's your basic superhero movie and for sed Superhero it's a great movie
B00275EHJG|4.0|I enjoyed all 3 Toy Story movies!  They all remind me of being a kid & thinking my toys had feelings & a life of their own:)  This one didn't disappoint & I even teared up.  Looks like I still believe toys have feelings.
B004ZY0VHY|2.0|The review of the movie sounded so good I decided to purchase the book. What a disappointment. DULL!!!!! Too much meandering. Takes too long to get to the jist of the story. Wouldn't recommend it
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy is simply a wonderfully written, erotic, sexy, breath-taking event. Yes, there issome aspects of BDSM in the book. However, you will quickly find that people have reasons for doing what they do. It is a deep look into the reasoning on the human mind and the decisions made thereof. Christian is a deep, lovely, sexy beast with a heart that he doesn't even realize he possesses. Ana is strong-willed, fierce, and naive all at the same time. These books are wonderfully written, and as a result, you will find yourself reading in the wee hours of the morning, hurrying through tasks just to get to them and thinking about Christian Grey at many times during the day and night. If Christian were remotely possibly real, I would move to the ends of the earth to have a man that feels that way about me. Read and enjoy. You will not regret it!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|finally! somewhere I can store all my shopping and to-do lists in one place without all these random pieces of paper scattered everywhere. love the checklists feature.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Was great for almost 2 weeks until this glitch made all my buildings and animals take 300+ hours until I could collect! What happened?! Hoping for an update, but if there isn't, I'm uninstalling.
B001FB563E|5.0|Read the book a few days ago and just finished the movie. One of the best book to movie representations I've ever seen. I was so blown away I decided to leave my first ever amazon comment about it. Acting was brilliant. Movie was perfectly paced. Score fit the movie. Overall scenery was more bleak than I could've imagined reading the book (this is a good thing).<br /><br />Watch it.
B003L77GRO|1.0|I saw the REAL series on Showtime. I always get the DVD after the series has ended. I have never been disappointed in the Showtime releases of Dexter until now. They edited the original so badly that the continuity between shows has been lost. This is a SIN!!!! They have sacrificed one of their best shows in favor of mindless advertisement for other less popular programs. If you can acquire Amazon streaming episodes of Season 5 that have not been cut, then that is what you should do. Showtime should re-release an uncut version of this DVD and try to recover their reputation. I am saving my Season 6 on DVR because I do not trust Showtime to do a decent job any longer.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I had been playing the game for about a week when all of the timers were set to 284 hours, that's almost 12 days. So I left it alone and checked back in 13 days and the timers had been set to 350 hours. I'm giving up on it and uninstalling it.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this is the most fun game in the world ppl get this its worth the two bucks ok listing to me ok
B00005CDNF|2.0|Friends who love sound quality don't let friends buy this distorted mess.  If you care about sound quality, stick with the 1992-1993 Gold and More Gold versions of the hits.  I had the \\"Thank You for the Music\\" boxed set from 1994 and sold it thinking these remasters would be much better.  I didn't like the tinny sounds of the highs on that set.  I even disregarded other reviews saying the sound of these 2001 remasters was bad.  After I bought this, I read up on it which versions were best and went to the used shop to get Gold and More Gold, and these sounded so much better when I compared.  This remaster is distorted and the sparkle is gone from Agnetha's voice on my favorite song, SOS.  The version on Gold has dynamics, sparkle and just sounds good - I love that version.  I just regret that \\"Hey, Hey Helen\\" is only on this remastered CD because it's a good song that is hacked up on this remastering as are all the rest.  I imagine the other 2001 remasters are the same and I will stay away from them, which is too bad.  In this case, newer is definitely not better, as I mistakenly thought.  Stick with the old.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|First I thought thatcthis game was like every free game... Not very good....  But this game is totally AWESOME I mean like I play My Kindle Fire with this game and it is the most very very very AWESOME GAME. IT IS WORTH TO ME ABOUT 3.99 BUT IT IS FREEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!
B007JRU2UK|1.0|Rarely walk out of movies, but this one we couldn't finish.  None of the characters were likable in the slightest bit.  It wasn't funny, it wasn't that dramatic, not sure what else to say.<br /><br />Many of my friends did like this movie though, so judge for yourself but be prepared to love it or hate it.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|the game is awesome. wave 4 is kinda hard. I would like it more though if it had a story mode.
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|I honestly hate this product.<br /><br />The idea is fantastic. Never have to replace my batteries? Heck yeah!<br /><br />The execution SUCKS. I lose connection to my mouse once or twice an hour. It's the most frustrating thing ever. The battery pack is firmly seated in the magic mouse and yes the stupid clip is positioned correctly (I appreciate that Mobee things so lowly of its customers that they think we can't install a battery correctly. Thanks.)<br /><br />Furthermore, I'd love to just throw this junk away, but I can't even remove the battery pack from my mouse. It's suck in there. This stupid company owes me a new mouse.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is the best tablet game. I love it because it is based off of Mario and I love Mario.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|Ryan Gosling and Emma stone were Awesome in this movie. Hanna got the player Jacob to quit the game, I think its because he saw that she was different from all the others, and that all he's life he was searching for a connection. Also it was really cool to see Steve Carell in another role less comedy like but more romantic. Cal got his family back in the end with a bonus. This movie is an A+++ in books!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|good game for all ages really good to be a free game app. would recommend ... check it out and see for yourself
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its super addictive! been playing for hours! would be nice if you got bigger coin bonuses for finishing a levelthougjh
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|similar to civilization or Sims. good timewaster. I wish the character didn't have to walk to all the locations. just wastes time. the game froze on me once and I had to uninstall and start over.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This is a fun and engaging game.  Sometimes can't even get past the first level of each one, very good game
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I really like the game. It is User friendly and has great controls. It reminds me of Mario. Please keep up the good work and this was a great idea.
0345803485|5.0|For those who started this book and didn't like it, it is your loss.  These books are about<br />unconditional love.  Yes he was controlling and yes a little freaky but you have to read all 3 books<br />to learn why.  This man would do anything to keep his wife and family safe and she would do anything to show her love for him.
0439023521|3.0|The Hunger Games is simple and engaging, a quick and easy read for young and old.  The writer pulls the reader along gently, but with enough force that he or she must discover the outcome.  A very young reader will enjoy a great story without suffering from real, bloody violence, but with a slight scent of death and competition.  Also, the power that government can have should awaken them to the value of voting after studying candidates beyond media hype into real ideologies.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|I have played the previous versions of Angry Birds and while not amazingly challenging they did entertain for a period of time.  This version was way too easy.  I have a 15 minute commute by train each way and I completed this game in about 3 days, total time less than 2 hours.  Many of the initial levels were so easy it was one shot and done for 3 stars.  In fact the entire first level only took about 5 minutes.  I am happy it was free and probably won't bother with any more in the future unless they make this a little more challenging in the future.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this app every day. It's portability and seamless synchronous capabilities make it one of my most valuable tools' allowing me to track notes and couplings across PC, smartphone, and tablet devices.
B006UUK612|5.0|One of my 'walk down memory lane' movies.  It's just fun and entertaining every time I see it.  Great family/kid flick.
B0078XGEK2|5.0|Awsome book for those who are interested in human behavior.  Should be a must read for all new parents.  Easy to read and understand.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. I originally downloaded it for my kids but they never got a chance to play it!! LOL
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I thought it was so funnn:)AT FIRST.but then I got tapped in the game.Wow they must be desperate for players.lol.its an OK game;)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|nice game I like all that you have done with it. maby not have it take so long to build stuff.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|What's it about?<br /><br />A journalist is helped by a highly intelligent female computer hacker (who will do ANYTHING for a dollar), to find a girl, missing for 40 years.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />I saw the original Swedish version when it was first released in 2007 and remember coming away feeling it was very good film. But, having seen the American adaption or remake (which ever it is), I came away feeling what a great film. Why? The success of the film is a result of David Fincher. His style, using his signature darkness, matches the tone and subject of the film to the ground. The music by Trevor Reznor is fantastic, mixed with some inspired choices, such as the pulsating opening sequence. James Bond himself, Daniel Craig, is very good in the lead role, but it's Rooney Mara, in her Oscar nominated performance, who is undoubtedly one of the highlights, in a film full of them.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />Bond's capture and torture...set to the music of Enya, no less!<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />According to David Fincher the opening title sequence of the movie is a \\"sort of primordial sort of tar and ooze of the subconscious... sort of her nightmare.\\"
B007V2UGPE|4.0|this is a very good game in general. the game is less cash dependant than other glue game. I recommand samurai vs zombie defense.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|haven't ever heard of the game before... but come to fins out it is quite popular. Very well made! looks great on Kindle Fire, only problem is that it doesn't support push notifications and says it is because KF doesn't either, which is wrong... it does. Otherwise, it is perfect.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|if it had an attack button the dead would die quicker. maybe a jump button or a way to aim?
B001EAWMGA|5.0|What a great movie. This is story futuristic soldier who crash lands in the time of the Vikings. Unkown to him he is followed back time with dragon like monsters. The monsters will kill any human that they find. This is story of people that are brave and fighting to the death against monsters that can't be destroyed. This movie has story, great visual and is well acted by Jim Caviezel, Sophia Myles and John Hurt. See this movie and you will have a great adventure.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|OMG!!!!!! I'm so glad they finally came out with a version for Kindle Fire!!!!! WARNING!!!!! THIS IS AN ADDICTIVE APP!!!!

B001E45XT4|3.0|I bought these because I wanted a cheap gaming headset for my house so I could bring my studio quality Audiotechnica set to work for music during the work day.  I will describe my findings on these below:<br /><br />1)  Quality:  The BUILD quality appears to be where I figured it would be for around $20.  The plastic is pretty firm in most areas and the cord seems to be a bit better than most of the negative reviewers describe it.  The microphone latches into the headband which can be pretty nice when you don't want a huge mic sticking out in front of your face and it appears to be fully functional when inside as well (if not, just turn your mic volume up).<br /><br />2)  Comfort:  They're comfortable everywhere except where it really counts,  inside the ear cups.  The speaker is encased in a hard plastic sheet with a circle cut out in the middle for the sound to escape.  In my opinion (and keep in mind I have normal to small-sized ears) the plastic comes out too far and the pads around around the ears are not deep enough which causes your ears to come into contact with the plastic.  It became rather uncomfortable within about 10 minutes of use.  However, this is something I suppose you could get used to.  I think this could be attributed to the fact that they fit rather tightly around my head as well which a lot of reviewers seem to mention.<br /><br />3)  Sound:  The sound quality is also where I figured it would be for a $20 headset.  I am no audiophile but I know good sound quality where I hear it and these are merely O.K.  In comparison, I just bought a $10 pair of Sony PiiQ earbuds for the gym and the sound is MUCH better on those and strangely come close to the quality of my $160 Audiotechnica set.  The bass is certainly lacking and everything else is a bit bland.  For the average person who is content with the sound quality of the earbuds their Ipod came with, this would be acceptable but for an avid gamer I should think not.<br /><br />Conclusion?<br />While $20 is pretty cheap, I feel that for an extra $20 you should buy a slightly better headset if you actually care about enjoying the sound being produced by them.  Also, the comfort level as stated above is something to be considered.  Also keep in mind that I did not post about the durability because I have only had these for about 2 weeks now.<br /><br />4)  Conclusion:
B006X415GK|4.0|Okay I got this doll for $4.13 on amazon and its beautiful, but mattel should have made a set of 5 other monster high kids to go along with the this one doll. Now you can find this doll all over the internet even on some retail store sites as a package deal with out items for a low price.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I was so glad that kindles got this app I saw it on my sisters IPAD and looked on my kindle and it wasn't there now it is.LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
0062082353|5.0|I found out about the book from watching the interview with Chris on Fox News. Not really familiar with military autobiographies, this one seemed like a good one to start with. I admit that the cover of the book and the fact that he claims title to the most confirmed sniper kills in U.S. history was my main intrest point. I also thought it would be good to hear a true soliders side of the story instead of what the media feeds us. I thought the book was fantastic...It was hard for me to put it down. I read it in three days. He tells everything I could think about in relation to what it would be like including mission details, marriage strain, injuries, training, gear, bar fights, losing friends, kills, and the emotions behind it all.  He takes the politics out of the war and shows you why he was able to do what he did, and what should have been done.<br /><br />He explains the honor, regret, and passion that he felt throughout his four tours -  a far better picture than any war movie that I've seen about the middle east. My favorite thing about this book was the fact that it was written in a way that anyone can understand. You don't have to be in the military to get everything. He explains all the inside terms and abbreviations  to you and his wife even adds her input to show you what it was like from her perspective. Not too much detail as to bore you, but just enough to deepen your understanding.<br /><br />Overall, it was well worth the money and time I put into it. If you're  like me with no military knowledge and wanted to know what it would be like to be a Seal sniper who gave his all, then I'd say go for it.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|i see that if i dont want ads and iget coins and such but when i click the ad nothin happens i rlly like the game but if i buy the full version will my games still b there and will i get the free stuff?????

B007LPSLO4|1.0|I am no literary critic.  In fact I consider myself a bit of a literary Philistine.  But this has to be the worst written book I have ever read.  Even I can recognize that there is no real plot, the characters are shallow and irritating, especially the downtrodden little heroine, there is no climax (except for the obvious) and I think the author must have had an appointment or just given up when she reached the end because there is no conclusion (after repeating part of the introduction, the author simply trails off with a \\"That's all ... for now.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for reading.\\")  The sex and S&M descriptions are repetitive and boring (since our hero and heroine are at it like rabbits every three pages or so and how many ways can you describe an orgasm).  I am astonished that in 2012, this kind of formulaic, cliche romance can get so much hype and accolades(ordinary girl meets dashing multimillionaire who showers her with trinkets, regularly rips off her bodice, or at least multiple pairs of La Perla lacy panties, and they all lived happily ever after).  It's like an updated Barbara Cartland novel spiced up with endless descriptions of sex and S&M.  I give it one star because it was such a trainwreck, I was compelled to read it to the very end just to see whether anything exciting ever happens--trust me, it doesn't.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I am so happy to have draw ssomething on the big screen of a kindle fire! I love it and am so happy and it is better than on ur phone or ipod and it is just woo cool on your kindle fire!!
0143121006|3.0|I have read several nonfiction books recently and they really intrigued me into checking this genre out more. That is why I wanted to check out Midnight in Peking. I thought the unsolved murder of a young Pamela Werner sounded intriguing. I was not the only one as Mr. French was also intrigued by Pamela's story and felt that he wanted to research her story himself and see if he could once again give Pamela a voice.<br /><br />Pamela was the daughter of E.T.C. Werner, a former British consul at Foochow. Back in 1937, Pamela's body was found lying on the ground near the Fox Tower outside the Legation Quarter. Pamela was almost unrecognizable due to all the stab wounds. In addition, her abdomen was spilt open with her heart and other organs removed and her clothing ripped to shreds. British Chief Detective Dennis and Chinese Detective Han work to try and solve the murder of Pamela. Unfortunately, Pamela's body is laid to rest and her case is closed.<br /><br />While, I did find Pamela's murder interesting, especially how another country handles their protocol for solving murders. I must admit that I did struggle to get through this book. I started it and than had to put it down and read something else before going back to it. This book kind of felt like a non/fiction book versus just a non fiction book. What with the fox spirits and such that this culture believes in. Also, it felt like it was really important to inform the reader about China and the detectives and their lives. Not a lot was shared about Pamela. Her story was intertwined in bits and pieces through out this book.
B000IOMYFW|5.0|This is one of my favorite records and I am so happy to own it on vinyl now. In my opinion, this album might be the best Pogues record.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I am so happy I can finally play on a bigger screen. I am addicted to this game. Need more color choices!
0446585025|5.0|Ok, so I'm not a reader at all but after going through some stressful times and researching ways to relax I found reading is one and laughter is another. Hopped on here and found this book. Ive always liked Ellen and watch her show not as often as I'd like but this book is down right hilarious. Literally made me laugh out loud and had tears strolling down my face from laughing so hard. I will definitely be looking into her first two books! Again, not a reader but finished this in a couple days, which is beyond awesome! Everyone needs to read it, it just too funny not to!

B0061S073A|4.0|The updates over time have improved this app! My kids especially like the user names. I hope they add an option for a pin on those. My kids are years apart. My older child can use apps my little one shouldn't & my older child has to have parental controls. Happy with everything else!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|its a cute game and fun to play but has so serious game play glitches. i haven't  been able to access the other villages and to exit the game you have to go into the options menu to go back to the home menu on the kindle fire.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Great app i cant put it down! They r lucky I finally gave my opinion. Ive had this app for almost 6 months
B0000256KE|5.0|One of the most inspiring and original albums of all time. Lush, experimental, innovative, brilliant rock, lyrically & musically, in my top 10 albums of all times. The peak of a band that would set the trends for another 20 years. This album is far more powerful, and assured than the first Roxy Music album and literally the band does and can go in any musical direction from here. Which at the time & 1st listen I knew it was such a brilliant album something had to give before the next album & unfortunately it did, namely Eno left on Ferry's orders.<br />After this of course the next two albums were great but the almost wilful experimentation was also missing. I'm not saying that it wasn't for the best for Eno & i did love Standed & even Eno at the time said very nobly that it was a great album & worked better without him but by God i cried bitter tears as it wasn't best for Roxy Music & i can only ponder & wonder how brilliant Country Life might have been if Eno had returned. Sometimes musical friction & then synthesis easily creates the strongest works because both composers are pushing each other to their peaks of creative powers as they are trying to outdo each other, like when at the end of the song in 'For your Pleasure' Bryan Ferry intuitively threw his headphones into the strings of the piano making the most brilliant and sustained echo effect & hence coda for the whole album. Obviously Do the Strand is one of the greatest rock dance songs ever & an awesome opening song which is still one of their most favoured live songs 40 years later. Another two genius songs are In every dream home & the Bogus Man, both incredible electronic rock excursions with nihilistic lyrics that are probably the peak Of Roxy Music composional & musical ability.<br />This is also the last R.M. album to have released a single with 2 different songs from the contempraneous album so from here some of Bryan Ferry's ideas & idealism went out of window & a hell of a lot of spontaneity. I would dream that the 2 Brians would reunite & for the last 20 years B.F. has been calling in the cavalry namely Eno to add sonic emphasis or even cowrite a song or 2 Thank God, however it needs to go further namely release an entire album that was apparently recorded with a reunited Roxy early 2002 i believe. Even the cover is totally moody evocative and mysterious, a must have album & one that needs to be heard by every discerning rock music fan. 2 Brians/brains are always far better than 1. A brilliant album that really was created for our pleasure, an album that still sounds incredibly inspired. 10/10

B007SSEBCU|1.0|I lost interest when I realized this is just another propaganda film for Hollywood's obsession with Reagan and Thatcher as their enemies.  This movie is ALL about attacking through stealth and then dismissing Thatcher's reality in her prime.  Streep gets to act without compromising her biased, flawed, poorly educated, alliterate, and poorly experienced ethics.<br /><br />Here is an idea for your next hatchet job, uh, I mean film.  Call it \\"Lincoln a man with a problem.\\"  Then have Pee Wee Herman play him in the last half hour of his life.  No flashbacks and no prior scenes are needed.  You don't even have to provide context.<br /><br />The bed scenes will be riveting and the makeup will be tremendous.  Pee Wee's lack of interest in the character's true strengths will not show since he can play a man who is comatose.  You can have various people visit him and make negative racist comments about him to satisfy your need to attack someone.  Make it on a budget of about ten dollars.<br /><br />There you go, now you know all you need to know about this stinker of a movie.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|I love the second one better than the first.  The graphics are so much better and I love the quest structure to the game.  Now that there are ten more levels per area, I'm a very happy person
B005Y423ZC|5.0|This is an excellent DVD and CD set! Adele is magnificant and the closet way to see her perform live with all her great songs. The band is fantastic and I love how Adele interacts with her audience. For those who long to see Adele perform live before she tours in your area, this is a must have. Well worth it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game and ya its cool just like Mario bros I give u a 90% chance ull like it
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob is one of the best reads in a long time for me. If I recall correctly, this is the author's first novel.....congratulations to him, and I look forward to reading many more of his works. His descriptions of the characters and the settings are perfect. I am a visual person, so I 'see' books as if they are movies and this one was incredible since the author is very talented in this regard. Anyone who has children worries about the worst things that can happen to their kids. It is truly a real pageturner.
B004SBBDB2|3.0|It does the job and the audio and video signal come clean.<br />Four Issues though:<br />First and foremost: The USB power comes bundled with the rest of the AV cables and split from them like in the last feet, so is too short and you'll need an USB extension or a power cord extension to make it work. But the video and audio works without power.<br />Second: The jacks are made of a very slippery plastic so is hard to pull out these cables once they are connected. It needs some rugged surface for a better grip.<br />Third. There are two cables that are color coded exactly the same. Red for video and Red for audio. It is hard to tell which one is which, it needs labeling.<br />Forth: The 30 pin adapter doesn't has a push to release and insert button so the connection is looser to what it could be if it had one.<br />So it is a 3.5 to 4 star product.

0385344228|3.0|I thought this was a good story, but not a great story.  The anguish of the parents, Andy and Laurie Barber, over their son's accusation of murder was worth reading, but the trial and the reading of transcripts were drawn out.  Of course, the parents believe in their son's innocence even when evidence is found that could prove otherwise. Landay did a good job of putting doubt into my own mind, but that doubt came late in the book when the Barbers go on a family vacation. Their vacation was the most suspenseful and disturbing part of the book in my opinion.<br /><br />Andy's dedication and love for his son was interesting, but his inner thoughts regarding Laurie were most fascinating to me.  He reflects on how he met his wife in college and how deeply in love (and lust) they were in. Now things are very different. They are nearly thirty years older and he notices every physical and emotional change in her. I felt their love was deep and abiding, but his thoughts questioned their ability to survive their family ordeal. They attend counseling and their sessions bring out some interesting  fears and shocking accusations. One of many as mentioned in other reviews is the theory of a \\"murder gene\\".<br /><br />The ending was abrupt and unsettling.  It left me in complete dismay. If you liked this book (or not) check out [[ASIN:B001PO6AFY Red Leaves (Otto Penzler Book)]] by Thomas H. Cook. It's also a family drama surrounding parents and their accused son. It's much more dramatic and suspenseful without the courtroom drama and reading of transcripts.

B003H9MSPG|3.0|The package does say \\"up to 35 feet\\", but I took that to mean we'd get it somewhere near that range.  We usually get 10-12 feet.  The maximum distance achieved has been about 20 feet.  My son's little $4.99 hand-sized gun shoots well past this one.  It looks cool so he likes it for the looks, but I wouldn't ever buy this one again.
1118109791|5.0|I graduated college in 2008 and now, finally, plan to attend Business school and pursue my MBA.  I scoured the web and bookstores for the best GMAT prep material and settled on this book.<br /><br />The Official guide to the GMAT (henceforth referred to as 'OG') is made by the folks that produce, proctor and develop this coveted exam. It covers all areas of the test, provides countless practice questions and answers AND (my personal favorite) it walks you through the right and wrong answers and how you may have slipped up. (ie: why the wrong answer was put in there to throw you off).<br /><br />The math is pretty straight forward.  Question, answer, explanation, study suggestion... repeat.  I am the WORST at math, so I plan to supplement this material not because it's lacking... because IM lacking. :)<br /><br />The verbal is where this book really shines.  The thorough explanations and grammar walkthoughs really hone your understanding of the language you thought you knew how to read and write.<br /><br />Overall, give yourself plenty of study time (this book is HUGE) and don't be afraid to quiz yourself... more than once.  It's a great buy, a great guide and you can trust it'll prepare you correctly as it's from the makers themselves.  Five Stars!
B007EW9ISM|5.0|Great weight has worked perfectly so far. it just feels comfortable to hold. Definitely worth the price cute packaging. All the other styluses I tried were too thin, or the tip too small.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Its got nice graphics, and is very fun, but it won't let me visit other villages. The home bar is accessible through the options menu. Please people!!

This really needs to be fixed!!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I found this game to be a lot of fun.  It is not too easy or not too hard.  The adds are only between each game so they don't get in the way of the game.  If you are looking for a good solitaire game, I would recommend. this game.

B005S9EJZA|5.0|I love this movie! It's about fate, destiny and true love through many obstacles. The movie starts out with a 25 year old marine Logan Thibault, played perfectly by a now grown up, filled out and very handsome Zac Efron. The war scenes are all of 5 minutes long during the very beginning of the film. Logan has just survived a night raid in Iraq when he comes across a picture of a young woman in the rubble and decides that she is his \\"guardian angel\\" because he survives things he shouldn't have. He vows to find her if he gets out alive. His best friend Victor sadly dies in another raid 8 months later. After Logan's third term at war ends, he decides to find her and thank her for saving his life. We learn that Logan, who briefly stays with his sister and her kids, is suffering from post tramatic stress syndrome and he is lonely and depressed. He finds out the picture of the woman is from Hamden, Louisianna because there is also a lighthouse in the picture with the woman. He sets out to WALK with his dog from Colorado to Louisianna to find her. We don't learn why he doesn't hitchhike, drive or take a bus and would prefer to walk across many states. We don't know how long it takes him (I am assuming it took many, many months) but in a scene we see him \\"camping out\\" with his dog. He arrives in Louisianna looking very good for someone that has walked thousands of miles and was \\"roughing it\\" in the wilderness for months.<br />Logan asks around at a local bar and shows the picture and finds out her name is Beth Green and she runs a nearby dog kennel. We then meet Beth and find out she lives with her Grandmother, has a 8 year old son, Ben, and runs a dog kennel business. She also has a nasty, bully of a ex husband who is the town sheriff named Keith who wants Beth back. We also learn that Beth's brother was also a marine and was killed about a year ago in action and the family has still not gotten over their grief.<br />Her Grandmother gives Logan a job at the kennel and he moves into a run down house close by the kennel. He befriends the family quickly and helps them out with just about everything and eats meals with them and becomes fast friends with Beth's son.<br />The cinemetography is beautiful in this film with the play of light of the sunrises and sunsets of Louisianna, it was filmed during the fall season and the colors are gorgeous, but it's really Zac Efron that steals every scene with his beautiful, expressive, bright blue eyes with lush eyelashes. This man is beyond beautiful! He is breath takingly handsome, his eyes, his lips, his dark hair, and his body. You can't take your eyes off him. He is troubled, torn and so intense, Zac plays this perfectly. His expression does not change much during the entire film. I wish we could of seen him smile more, but that was the part he was playing.<br />Everything about Logan is the perfect man, he is a hardworker and can fix anything, he is kind, caring and sensitive, romantic, plays the piano, great with the dogs at the kennel, and extremely good looking. He is also excellent with Beth's son and they play chess together and a special bond forms between them. Logan restores her family's old boat and gets it running after many years of just sitting. He is a big help and great to have around. Logan has a heart of gold. Beth believes Logan is too good to be true, and resists him at first and then he wins her over. We watch Beth checking him out from a distance, noticing how handsome and muscular he is.<br />I felt that the actress they chose to play Beth (Taylor Schilling) wasn't quite right for the part. She seemed a little too old to play opposite Zac Effron and their chemistry is somewhat lacking, that being said, we watch the couple first become friends, go out on a date, then trust each other and then fall in love then become lovers.<br />The love scenes I think could of been done a little better, the couple starts kissing in a outdoor shower and the audience sees this through someshutters (which makes it kind of distracting). They are just kissing and early stage undressing at this point. They then proceed to a mosiquito netted canapy bed where the couple makes love for the first time. There is no nudity at all. Again, it's Zac's beautiful eyes and the way he looks at her when they are intimate that makes it seem so real. It's HIS beauty that is showcased. It's very tender and beautiful and you believe the couple is deeply in love like he can't believe this is really happening. Although, they never say \\"I Love You\\" to each other at any time during the film. I guess the words aren't really necessary. They don't show Zac from the front as much during these love scenes you only see his bare back and how muscular he has become.<br />The ex husband Keith finds out about their romance and becomes increasingly jealous and crazy and threatens to take Ben from Beth if she doesn't break up with Logan. Keith finds the picture of Beth that Logan had in his possesion, after he broke into his house and stole the picture. Keith shows Beth the picture. Beth confronts Logan and tries to break up with him and we see Logan packing during a wild, violent rain storm but he doesn't leave yet.<br />Keith turns up at Beth's during the storm and wants to take Ben for good, Ben flees to his tree house with rope stairs across a rapidly rising river from the flash flood. Keith tries to save Ben with Beth and Logan close behind him, and when Keith reaches Ben on the rising river he hands him to Logan and then the tree house falls and kills Keith. I felt the ending was too convienent and quick, the bad guy gets killed and then the others live happily ever after, now that's he's gone and out of the way.<br />After Keith's death, Logan is walking away preparing to leave for good, and Beth runs after him and says \\"please stay, you belong with us\\" (which I believe is his reward for all he's been through during the war) and then they hug & kiss. It's a very emotional scene.<br />The last scene is Beth, Ben & Logan out in the boat Logan restored playing happy family. Definately living happily ever after.<br />I would really recommend this movie, the acting is wonderful, it's a heart warming, beautiful love story. It makes you say: \\"I wish this would happen to me\\". I wish someone like Logan would walk into my life.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|This cpu was worth it, loading and speeds, no lag or any hickups, while multitasking.<br />This cpu runs cool, Although it just might be my h100 with four Excalibur's running, but my idle temps are 26c at 20c/70F room temp (Although I have not oc'ed this processor, really I have no reason too.)<br /><br />Those who want a low budget, cpu to throw on your 3.0 board, so you can wait to utilize the new GPU's and get that extra gaming margin percentage when available, This is a must buy.<br /><br />And remember if you buy this, There is no Cpu cooler.. well most of you who research this much know this Good Luck :D, if you get a bad egg, you can always replace or return :D!

B0031TZ9KS|5.0|Terrific book, but Random House has priced all of their ebooks so far out of reach that I will wait until their prices return to some semblance of sanity before I ever purchase another book of theirs!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I play this game on my Kindle Fire and it is an awesome game. Like any other &quot;energy driven&quot; game it is slow going at first. I am lvl 38 and have a ton of energy now. I like the quests tho sometimes you may have 5 at once. I also had the glitches and some of my buildings and animals froze in time....but it has been fixed and I am back to playing again. Awesome FREE game and reminds me of Frontierville on Facebook.
B007VPLNGW|1.0|the game would start but would never let me pick a level and freeze out alot. had to delete and reinstall tje game but still had the problem. ask for a refund. amazon return the money thanks

B000K4X5XA|5.0|My son is a huge superhero fan and loves the original Superman. Our old DVD was so dated but this Blu-Ray is a highly recommended upgrade. I can't remember this movie ever looking greater.
1401937519|5.0|I've tried to investigate this woman to find information that doesn't quite jive, but so far, at least her medical records seem to be coming from a place of truth.  She appears to be a normaland articulate person.  I do like her description of the afterlife, no judgement, no defined God.  I wish she went into more description of how her everyday thought process has changed.  She seems to be saying the same thing over and over again in the book in different ways and I'd love to have more specifics.  I'm sure trying to explain a place that is so different from our consciousness must be difficult.  I guess until someone comes up with something false about her backround, or story I will believe - and what a wonderful concept to ponder!
B001NXBRJG|5.0|The office shootout made my list of top 10 movie scenes to show off your sound system. The movie itself is the Matrix, a movie just good enough to help me forget those godawful sequels.

B004RE29PO|5.0|While this is a sequel is a complete disconnect from the original. The planet is the same, Ripley is the same but dear God is this a James Cameron movie. It is completely larger than life. I remember watching this as a kid, buying it on VHS while in college, on DVD when it was finally released there and was so anxious for the Blu Ray release. This is my favorite of all the Alien related flicks.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I like this game EXCEPT the option to use real money to buy things (especially energy) if you are just starting its frustrating you cant do much. Lets say you do purchase something well amazon has no problem charging you but seems to have an issue loading what you purchased.  Once you get several levels in the lack energy becomes less of a problem.
B0017HRCQU|5.0|Awesome transfer to a great movie. Definitely worth the DVD to Blu upgrade. The picture and sound has never looked so good.

Stephanie Meyer is the best writer EVER!I absolutely looovvveee how in the middle of the book she shows everything from Jacobs point of view! because i looovvveee Jacob. I'm just sad that theres no more books!:(
B002MQYOFW|1.0|Everything that's terrible about THG is in this sentence:<br /><br />\\"Hunger Games was written by a woman and stars a woman (much as we love JK Rowling, her series isn't named after Hermione) -- making it a true lady-centric blockbuster franchise.\\"<br /><br />Here's your first point of irony: this true lady-centric blockbuster franchise isn't named after Katniss, it's named after what happens to Katniss, which is why it is truly a lady-centric franchise.<br /><br />How would you classify this book/movie's genre?  Is it an action movie with a female twist?  Is it a love story?  A drama?  Sci-fi?<br /><br />No. It is a fairy tale.<br /><br />We can start with the obvious.  The book is about 24 kids thrown into an arena to fight to the death, only the toughest, the most resourceful, the strongest will survive, and it better be you because your whole village depends on it.  It is such a scary premise that there was some concern it was too violent for kids to watch.  Well, big surprise:  Katniss wins.<br /><br />Hmmm, here is a surprise: Katniss never kills anyone.  That's weird, what does she do to win?  Take as much time as you want on this, it's an open book test.  The answer is nothing.<br /><br />This is not a criticism about the entertainment value of the story, but about its popularity and the pretense that it has a strong female character. I like the story of Cinderella, but I doubt that anyone would consider Cinderella a strong female character, yet Katniss and Cinderella are identical.<br /><br />The traditional progressive complaint about fairy tales like Cinderella is that they supposedly teach girls to want to be princesses and want to live happily ever after.  But is that so bad?  The real problem with fairy tales is that the protagonist never actually does anything to become a princess.  Forget about gerrymandering or slaying a dragon or poisoning her rivals: does she even get a pretty dress, go to the ball and seduce the prince?  Those may be anti-feminist actions, but at least they are actions.  No.  She is given two dresses, carried to the ball, and the Prince comes and finds her. Twice.  Her only direct and volitional action is to leave the ball at midnight, and even that isn't so much a choice as because of a threat. The clear problem with this isn't that girls will want to hold out for a Prince, but that it might foster the illusion their value is so innately high that even without pretty clothes or a sense of agency a Prince will come find them.  Sleeping Beauty and Snow White are worse: they don't even have to bother to stay alive to get their Prince.<br /><br />The Hunger Games has this same feminist problem.  Other than the initial volunteering to replace her younger sister, Katniss never makes any decisions of her own, never acts with consequence-- but her life is constructed to appear that she makes important decisions.  She has free will, of course, like any five year old with terrible parents, but at every turn is prevented from acting on the world. She is protected by men-- enemies and allies alike; directed by others, blessed with lucky accidents and when things get impossible there are packages from the sky.  In philosophical terms, she is continuously robbed of agency.  She is deus ex machinaed all the way to the end.<br /><br />For example, though this is a story about kids killing kids, somehow Katniss never actually plans and executes any kids, she's never guilty of murder one.  She does kill Rue's murderer, but it was reflexive, a defensive act.  Importantly, she does not choose NOT to kill,  she does not choose a pacifist position, she explicitly states twice in the book how much she wants to kill.  But she never does it. She tries to kill big bad Cato at the end, twice, and fails.  Only after he is torn to shreds by mutants does she perform a mercy killing on him, at his request.  In other words, she doesn't choose to kill or not kill-- it doesn't come up.<br /><br />The story goes out of itsway to prevent her from having to make choices and especially from bearing their consequences.  Events unfold in such a way that it appears she made a choice, but decisions are actually made for her.  At the end she and Peeta, her kinda-boyfriend, are the last two contestants left.  Only one can live.  What should happen next?  Does she kill him?  Or let him kill her?  Think about it, what does she choose?  Remember, this is about a strong female character forced to play a killing game.  Wait-- never mind, they change the rules at the end: everyone's a winner!<br /><br />\\"But she chooses to commit suicide at the end!\\"  That would have been a choice, but the book robs her of that as well, this is the point.  The book does not allow her to make irreversible choices, it lets her believe she is making free choices and then negates them, again, just like a five year old girl with terrible parents.<br /><br />She does commit one consciously deliberate act, and it's quite revealing.  At the end of the book, she's ambivalent about whether she loves contestant Peeta.  But the Games allowed two winners only because they appeared to be in love; so all she has to do, for the cameras, is pretend to be in love with a boy she already likes a lot.  But after all she's been through in the arena, this-- what is coincidentally called ACTING-- is what is described, in the shocking last sentence of the chapter,  as \\"the most dangerous part of The Hunger Games.\\"<br /><br />This is not hyperbole.  This is literally correct: for someone who has not ever done it, acting with agency would indeed be dangerous.  But those stories aren't fairy tales, those stories are legends.<br /><br />That the book is successful or exciting is not the point here.  What's fascinating/horrifying is that this fairy tale has managed to convince everyone, especially people who consider themselves feminists, that it represents a form of female empowerment when it is exactly the opposite. What you should not underestimate is how deliberate this magic trick is.  This is society successfully pretending to change so that nothing changes.  The goal is making the other team contribute to their own oblivion.  The goal is status quo.<br /><br />The classic feminist example of \\"robbed of agency\\" is the woman who \\"chooses\\" to wear makeup, do her hair, display/hide the right amount of cleavage.  Is she choosing this, or is society imposing this false choice on her?  Because if she feels she has to do it in order to land the account, then it's not really her choice.  Hence a controversy about agency.<br /><br />What makes this such an impossible, lose-lose situation for a woman is that this choice isn't about \\"what to do\\" but about who she is, what society wants a woman to be: while she must make herself look pretty, if she is observed doing this she is immediately and simultaneously critiqued for being vain.  The decision about whether to be or not to doll herself up is thus somewhat up to her, but the judgment about whether she is vain is entirely out of her hands-- it is a judgment imposed on her for doing exactly what is expected of her.  Her only hope is that she is can make herself look pretty enough that it looks like it was not on purpose, i.e reveal the results but hide the process. This manipulation of her is all deliberate design-- what society actually wants is that it gets her to be pretty, demarcates her as an object to be gazed upon--  but not bear any of the guilt/responsibility for forcing her into this.  If it works and you are pretty I guess that's some consolation, but imagine if you're not pretty but still have to go through all this, suspecting but never admitting that everyone is going to think, \\"why'd she even bother?\\"  Being pretty is in many ways worse, because you're not only competing with other pretty women but with yourself (\\"you look tired today\\")  and, as the old saying goes, a beautiful woman dies two deaths.  But before you go try some of our Nivea skincare products.  That's the system, it wants you to participate in your own marginalization so you don't dare unplug.  It's exhausting being a chick.  I mean girl--  woman.  Jesus.<br /><br />Though this is an example of the feminist agency problem, you should note carefully that the \\"society\\" that forces this false choice on women is actually other women, not men, and it starts with the overly invested way mothers reproach their daughters to \\"dress like a lady.\\"  Certainly the original energy for this madness comes from men, from \\"the patriarchy\\", but if every man was executed tonight nothing would change tomorrow.  It's on autopilot.  Case in point: this story of a girl robbed of agency was written by a woman.<br /><br />So this is why we have a book about a post-apocalyptic killing game that spends zero pages describing how Katniss kills anyone but spends countless pages on how she is dressed, how everyone is dressed.  What will she wear?  What kind of jewelry?  Hair up?  Will the \\"sponsors\\" like her better this way or that?  Her chief weapon isn't a bow, it's her appearance.<br /><br />This is also a good place to observe that the real life, pre-and post movie release controversies about The Hunger Games have also been about physical appearances-- not just race, but is Jennifer Lawrence too tall?  Hair too blonde?<br /><br />That's why The Hunger Games is such a diabolical head fake.  Forget about it being entertaining, which I concede it is.  It has managed to convince everyone that a passive character whose main strength is that she thinks a lot of thoughts and feels a lot of feelings, but who ultimately lets every decision be made by someone else-- that is a female hero, a winner. You wouldn't allow yourself to like a story where the woman lacks agency, so it's clothed in a vampire story or a female Running Man so it sounds like she's making things happen.  Or, if you prefer, in order to allow you to like an anti-feminist story, it is necessary to brand it asa vampire story or a female Running Man.  Regardless of how you phrase it, the purpose is to get you to like this kind of a story. It wants you to think this is the next step in female protagonists.  But it's a trick: nothing has changed since the royal ball.<br /><br />That these \\"adolescent girl\\" stories-- Twilight and THG-- have women who are essentially lead by men, circumstance, and fate-- whose main executive decision is \\"do I love this guy or that guy\\"-- is a window on our culture worth discussing.  When you have a daughter, your first question should be, \\"how is the system going to try to crush her?\\"  and plan accordingly.  This story's answer is, \\"no matter what happens, just talk a lot and it'll sort itself out.\\"  That Jezebel is distracted by the racial angle here strikes me as an unconsciously deliberate avoidance of the larger issue.  Oh, the audience is racist, that's the problem.
B002ZG9846|5.0|I'll keep this short.  This movie is full of action, has some great laughs and kept me entertained throughout.  If you need to forget the crazy day you had at work and wind down, fix some popcorn and pop this title into your player.  You'll be in a much better mood when it's over.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love it!!! Very addicted indeed...I can't wait to reach the next level every time :) I reccomend it without hesitation.

I enjoyed the twilight series for what it was a cheesy teen love story.. but this is just horrible...  it's not a twist off of twilight it's the same damn characters with new names and with a slighty different life (but not much)  that being said and if you can truck through the horrible \\"Story\\" James actually does a pretty good job of describing the intense sexual scenes (personal experience maybe?? who knows)  and the way i see it.. if it helps spark some romance back in your life.. why not..

B002RSDWF8|4.0|If you are debating between the original version and this deluxe version, go for this one. It is well worth paying a little extra.<br /><br />For me, the ambient mixes on disc 2 in many cases are superior to the original tracks. It is not up-beat, and certainly it is not something one can just dance to-- and certainly Moby has created other music for those purposes-- but this is perfect for quiet introspection. It is a darker, perhaps more soulful collection of songs, and again, I highly recommend the ambient mixes for a different take on Moby.

B0078N2MTE|3.0|I read the reviews on amazon before renting it & several people called it \\"excellent, masterpiece \\" etc,  so I took a chance. The movie was good...but a little slow. However, this type of story has been done before & better. Michael Shannon was in another movie called \\"Bug\\"..same premise as this \\"is he crazy or is it real\\". See \\"Bug\\", its a better movie, fast paced & it keeps you guessing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Interesting, easy read for teens and adults.  Kept me on the edge of my seat.  I felt like I was right there with the characters.  Excellent descriptions of scenery and characters' emotions.
B000W07EKW|5.0|My brother bought this a while back and it wasn't JUST 3 separate DVDs it came with a Jason Bourne American passport an extra extras DVD along with 1 more thing I can't quite remember it was pretty cool and I don't know whats wrong with this version of the collectors edition that people seem to be complaining about
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The books are fast paced, an easy read and a thought provoking look into the future.  Having all three combined into one download is great, you don't miss or forget anything that has happened.
B007R41E8O|5.0|If you like hunt and find adventures you will like this.  I had no problem down loading, some said they did. It has fantastic graphics and story line.  I love games like this and have enjoyed playing this one, well worth the price.Alawar, please keep them coming!
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this app I play it every day and it never gets boring. it challenges u with different objectives and you get ranked when u complete each one.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I saw my parents playing it and I REALLY wanted it and it finally came out on kindle fire yea!!!!!
B006GECE9Y|5.0|After becoming totally fed up with the stock browser that came with my tablet (which continually closed itself every two seconds) and being unable to find a fix, I started searching for another browser.  I tried the Maxthon first but was aggravated by the way it automatically loaded the mobile version of a site instead of the web version.  I do not like or need the mobile version of most anything as I don't have data limitations nor a small screen like a phone would.  The Dolphin browser gave me the choice upon setup of choosing which way I want to view sites :-)  The bookmark import as well as adding favorites is very easy and intuative.  Opening new tabs is also easy and just like Explorer.  So far everything is great plus it is much faster than the stock browser which is wonderful.  Thanks for a great app!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|hi I think that everyone should get this app because you can play it all the time (if your aloud to)  I know I play this game as much as I can because I am only 12 years old and I have to help my parent's clean the house.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is the best game ever i can't  stop playing and i think everyone should get it! i love it.
B002WY65VU|2.0|If you enjoy watching a friend play the Sony Playstation for an hour and 20 minutes then you'll probably enjoy this movie.  Jessie Eisenberg should stick to films about computer geeks.  Harrelson proves yet again his natural born instinct for killing.. in this case, zombies.  This movie didn't try to take itself seriously obviously but was still a far cry from funny or anything even approaching clever.  But if you're looking for all the plot intricasies of a video game then you may have found your movie here.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I liked the simple concept and music. Being a puzzle game, the background story seemed to be a little mysterious and the water drop theme didn't pay off at the end. But for a puzzle game, the gameplay was there and it was well done.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I loved everything about this book!!  The manner in which she writes, made me feel like I was alongside with her!  It was inspiring and deeply thoughtful.  I immediately read her first book, after I finished this one, and reay enjoyed that as well!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I bought the book so I could watch the movie later (I hate to do it the other way around) and I found myself spending most of my time reading the book. For two days I did mostly anything else.
B000AM2L1O|4.0|Good quality doll (especially for the price) but does not come with the option to use a paci. The teeth aren't obvious but still bothered me a little.  I initially thought of returning it but it paired so well with the sky version that I ended up keeping it. My daughter likes her.
B007VGXS8M|5.0|I really like this app. there are lots of different searches and some other games thrown in. you can play quick games,  adventures,  or mini games.<br />I bought this to keep my 9 year old entertained and it does the job. I even like it too!
B004LROMQG|5.0|This is the third season of my newest favorite TV show ( after Sherlock). The casting and quailty of ensemble acting is first rate. The voice of John Hurt as Kilgara the Dragon evokes LOR and wonderful Fantasy memories for this Geek. The Evil Sorceress is a ravishing blond, and Katy McGrath's Morgana is sneakily mean and effective as dark side of magic. Merlin, skinny geek that he is, is the perfect foil for gorgeous but vacuous Arthur - who is ignorant of how Merlin saves him time & time again with the Dreaded Magic!! I look forward to this show and am glad that this quality of programming is available. Grade A+
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Sorry, but the third book is just a waist of money and good intentions.<br />Could have combined it with the second book and shorten it.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This was recommended by George RR Martin and is the only reason I purchased it on my Kindle Fire. It was magnificent! well-written, good character development, creation of an entire world that was believable but enticing. The main character, a Magician in training, is an orphan from what would be gypsies (on earth)and is stupid, emotional, foolish and endearing. I rushed to read the second Episode, and was pleased that it too was exciting, breathtaking and thankfully long. I can't wait until the Third Episode arrives!! Grade A++
0143039504|5.0|I do not have one complaint! If you're looking for a collection of all her novels in one book, this is the version to get. Obviously, with six novels (and also her other work, Lady Susan, included), this is a large book. But it's just the right size for what it is and lays open very nicely. And the rough, uneven edge of the pages is a really nice touch. People have left reviews complaining of the small text... it's not too small by any means. Unless you have bad eyesight. I've read several books that have had much smaller text than this. If you're the kind of person who delights in the feel of a nice quality paperback in your hands, this is for you. Definitely great, great quality. An essential for any true Austen fan. I absolutely love it and will be reading it for years and years to come.  Oh, and it is such a huge bargain compared to buying each novel separately (even just in paperback). Get one!
B007R41E8O|5.0|This game is wonderful. The storyline was very interesting and it flowed nicely. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone. Well worth the price.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this game is lots of fun and very addictive. every action requires a unit of energy though, so a lot of times you have to stop playing and come back after your energy builds up unless you buy more which can be inconvenient.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|After purchasing the original  splashtop months ago I truely enjoyed the app. However recently they released a prime edition for 5 dollars more with \\"enhanced\\" features while taking certain features away from the original. Bad business splashtop.
B0055SWM08|4.0|it passes the time well.  the music great.  very relaxing.  i don't love it, but I like it.  I have played a lot of types of games and this is a good game for killing a few minutes.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a great game set but the ads keep popping up after you finish one game. but overall its fun to waste time on
1612930727|5.0|This is a powerfully insightful book based on scientific research and studies of the workings of the conscious and subconscious mind.  Written in an easy to read and understandable format, the reader is fascinated by the power of how our subconscious mind can be used to change the course of events in our lives.  Using this technique has begun to change the once difficult ability to lose weight into an easy method of training my subconscious to redirect my intent on being at a healthy weight.  I use the simple method of setting the desire to be healthy, full of vitality, and mindful of eating healthy and exercising within the subconscious. Using this method for 3 months has resulted in the loss of 26lbs.  Great book, timely, and affordable.  It's a must have in any self-help library; it will probably be the only one that remains in your self-help library or the most read.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I think it is one of the best games I have ever played in my whole entire life It is the best nothing will beat it
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|HBO has made the best show in the world. The amazing Plot by Gorge RR Martin with the best directing around. With that some of the greatest actors known and unknown. I wish that it came out sooner. I would recommend this to anyone over the age of 18 it is very graphic in all parts.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will play it all night. 101games+23=awesome. best game in the world. my brother is playing right now.
0545265355|4.0|One star missing. First this book is a great easy read for young and old adults, it is truly a page turner. Great plot both in the political and emotional parts of the trilogy. The last book was rushed. In the end everything was way to fast. Their should have been a fourth book, just for the ending.
B004LWZW8I|5.0|have 300 was on the same path but this movie is just a bit DARK at times, the story old but up to date just a bit DARK.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book was overly tame by BDSM standards. The reviewers of this book must not read the genre regularly. I would say read it if you want to read an improbable love story but if you want BDSM it would suit your best interest to keep searching for the perfect book
B005HEW8S6|5.0|First off this isn't your typical \\"problems with the holodeck\\" episode.<br />It was caused by photonic beings that were inadvertently captured by Voyager's crew and studied, and in retaliation the photonic \\"being\\" transmitted into the holodeck and kidnapped the crew that came into contact with \\"grendel\\" the monster that was to be slayed by Beowulf aka Ensign Kim.<br /><br />This episode broke new ground with the transfer of the Hologram Doctor into the Holodeck to rescue his crew members, since he can choose to be energy or matter, the \\"grendel\\" can't harm him, or so he thought.  Looks like the Doctor got more than he bargained for!  Can he ultimately defeat this \\"being\\" himself? He'll need the help of his crew outside the holodeck if he wants to make it back alive...and fast!<br /><br />Gr8 Don't miss episode! Remember all these episodes are cumulative and like a cumulative finals you're gonna wish you've studied er watched all of 'em!  So don't listen to the reviewer above!
0345803485|1.0|Happy that the author is making millions but not certain why this book is getting so much attention.  It was so boring . . . nothing happened.<br /><br />Synopsis: Bridget Jones gone terribly wrong.  Incredibly irresistible, hot billionaire, into BDSM, meets American college virgin who, unwittingly, speaks and thinks she's British . . . 500 pages of: discussing a BDSM contract . . . he's so hot, he's so gorgeous . . . sex, orgasm, sex, orgasm . . . chit-chat, chit-chat . . .  sex, orgasm, sex, light bondage, spanking, orgasm . . .  he's so hot, he's so gorgeous . . . i melted when he touched me . . . more sex, multiple orgasms . . .  chit-chat, chit-chat . . . everyone turns scarlet, and is intimidated, when they meet Mr. Grey, and becomes a blithering, salivating idiot (believe me, not many women are intimidated by a hot guy) . . . he rolled his eyes, my mom rolled her eyes, Ray rolled his eyes, Kate/Katharine/Katharine Kavanaugh (pick one name, PLEASE) rolled her eyes, I rolled my eyes (but I got spanked, WAH!) . . . I pursed my lips, he pursed his lips . . . I pursed my lips again, he pursed his lips again . . . I bit my lip, Anastasia stop biting your lip (Seriously, with all the self-lip biting going on page after page after page, does Ana even have any of her own lip left to bite?) . . . I blinked, he blinked, she blinked . . . we all blinked . . . blink, blink, blink. Needles to say, there was NO character development and lots and lots and lots of repetition . . . and \\"muttering.\\"  Don't even get me started on the muttering.  It was like the author woke up each morning and forgot what she had written previously, so she just decided, what the heck, she'd just write the same thing again . . . and again . . . and again.<br /><br />It was truly like Ground Hog day with bad sex scenes. The book was pathetically written - you could easily decipher that the author was a 50-year old British woman.  I have never heard a college-aged American girl use the words, \\"pram,\\" \\"bloody\\" (oh bloody hell) or \\"cad,\\" or consistently use such bizarre terminology over and over and over again. You could play a drinking game with the words, \\"hitched,\\" \\"hooded,\\" \\"crap,\\" \\"my inner goddess,\\" \\"blink,\\" and \\"unbidden\\" and die of alcohol poisoning by the final chapter. And the fact that a working college student doesn't own her own personal computer or have a personal email account is inconceivable, especially given the fact that the majority of American toddlers, in this day and age, have both -- and an iPhone and an iPad and an iPod!<br /><br />Skip the book, instead, just use these buzzwords, which literally appear on every page, and everyone will believe you've actually read the book:<br /><br />My breath \\"hitched.\\" / His breath \\"hitched.\\" (who uses this word, in this context, anyone?)<br />He looked at me, his eyes \\"hooded.\\"<br />Crap! / Holy crap! / Double crap! / Triple Crap!<br />Unbidden . . . (Unbidden? Seriously? I've NEVER even heard this word used in the US and I'm 50! . . . and have three higher educational degrees!!)<br />I blinked / he blinked<br />My inner goddess, My subconscious, My inner sub (Okay, Sybil, how many crazies you got living inside that head of yours?)<br /><br />It was exhausting. Repetitive and exhausting. By the end of the book, I was so annoyed by the character that I wanted to spank the crap out of her myself. And then spank the crap out of the author for writing such drivel.<br /><br />Believe me, a true Dominant would have about 10 minutes of patience with Ms. Anastasia Steele. I really wanted to like this book but, sadly, it was just not meant to be.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|When they show first aired, I caught maybe the first 2 episodes and then I lost track of it. When season 2 aired, I was hooked! I bought this to catch up. In the set are 3 discs. Discs 1+2 have all 6 episodes of Season 1 on them. The rest of disc 2 and all of disc 3 has behind the scenes stuff, which I find interesting. There's even a short in there that shows you how you can do your own zombie makeup cheaply for Halloween costumes! I enjoyed this set and can't wait for season 2 to be released. I recommend it to all fans of The Walking Dead comics and the AMC series.
B007JUWM64|1.0|A total waste of my money, a really bad remake, and I hope it just goes away, and I would just like to forget it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game. I got it the first day it went on the market. I have been checking for this game forever... I luv this game a lot. the only thing I wish u could do on it os be able to logout and log back in under that name. at least I don't know how to do that.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. it is very fun and challenging. overall an awesome game! anyone who likes mini-games will love this.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|this app is driving me nuts cause when I log in it takes me back to home screen. waste of money and time
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book kept me on my toes.  Katniss is strong, brave, and loyal, and I loved the romance part intertwined in the action. Although it may seem a horrid thought to think of a society where kids kill kids all while being televised. The reality is that in our contemporary society we are exposed to images at such a rapid pace that we have become desensitized. In addition there are wars where kids are currently killing other kids.  Collins was able to creatively shed light on violence against kids, along with other social issues in this book.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I have fun but with how fast your evergy goes it gets boring fast... wish there was a way to buy energy with out real money... but I guess that's how the word goes round... Haha makes sense to me
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Can't get out of this game! Had to shut it down to get out and then removed it remotely from my<br />kindle. What a pain1
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game I hope everyone will come be my neighbor please keep the acorns coming thank you Johnnie!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|a few gliches ...but overall a wonderful game... very addicting... especially for my children!. love the short movies! have to find more friends to complete some missions.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|My wife has a simple Kindle that works just fine for her needs.  Now I can read Kindle files just as well from my little Android tablet, with no additional expense.  That is terrific!
B007549W62|1.0|Saying this movie is dark is an understatement. It's really just one depravity after the next, each one topping the last. You never find out why anything is occurring either. I like post apocalyptic movies, but this was a total disappointment. If you like this sort of thing, watch the first 5 minutes and then the last 5 minutes, just to get the feeling of the atmosphere. Everything in between really doesn't have much to do with it except for a bunch of people going nuts because they can't cope. Remember that guy from Terminator, the one who was sent back in time to be protect Sarah Connor? Yeah he's in it too. He must have needed to eat that week.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love draw something!!! fianlly I have been waiting for it to come out on my kindle first !!!! because I have had it on my ipod touch for so long!!! now I cant till they come out with temple run for kindle fire.

B0053O89JM|5.0|[[ASIN:B0053O89JM House, M.D.: Season Eight]]<br />What a sad farewell. this season was not as good as' Many, but still. Above and beyond most other tv shows. Laurie is a genius, and so are some of his ensemble... RSL (Wilson) especially.<br />I WILL MISS  the life that included this story.
B00536OCYG|1.0|Let me start by saying that this review reflects more the products description and Amazon's handling of this product.  The music is awesome and timeless and I will include a section reviewing the actual product that I received below.<br /><br />Ok, so as some other reviewers have pointed out, there seems to be some kind of mess up on Amazon's side and the \\"Product Description\\" section of the items page despite the version that you are actually looking at for purchase is for The Wall - Immersion Box Set.  This is a box set with all kinds of little goodies in it, the regular studio recording (remastered), a live recording, demo recordings, a DVD and just all kinds of fun stuff (currently $107.88 on Amazon).  I, however was looking to buy The Wall on vinyl and was under the impression from the description that I would be getting all of this great stuff, but in a vinyl format instead of on CD.  Simply opening the Amazon box proved me wrong.  What I received is exactly what is in the picture that I posted.  2 records and a code to download the mp3's.  This is still nice and great, but not what I was expecting.<br /><br />Once I saw this, I looked into it and found that ALL of The Wall items have the same description which really only describes ONE item.  Also, any review left for one item shows on all of the item pages.  I would not be surprised if someone reading this is looking at the regular CD, another at the vinyl and maybe even another considering buying a cassette tape.  So, as FAIR WARNING, look look look and make sure that you are buying what you think you are buying.<br /><br />Now, to review the actual item that I received.  Mmmmmm Nice!  180 gram vinyl of a classic.  It looks, feels and sounds amazing.  The only thing even slightly disappointing is that the album cover is just \\"the wall\\" bricks and the text \\"Pink Floyd The Wall\\" is a sticker stuck to the front.  It looks a little cheesy and you can even see the brick lines through the thin sticker.  It was a pretty lame choice by the manufacturer, but whatever.<br />After removing it from the plastic, there is a sticker that falls off of the back.  This sticker accurately describes exactly what is included in the package.  I am really not sure why it is a sticker, but I am glad that it was not stuck to the back of the album cover.<br />Opening the package reveals a large poster with The Wall bricks and the lyrics to every song between the folds of the cover.  Very nice.  :)<br />Each album is in it's own plastic bag, but also has a thin cardboard slip cover with the lyrics to each side of each disk, very similar to the poster.<br />Finally, there is another small piece of paper that includes a code for downloading the high quality mp3's.<br /><br />This is probably the eighth copy of The Wall that I have bought over my life, but the first vinyl copy.  Over all, I would say that it was $50 well spent.pretty lame choice by the manufacturer, but whatever.<br />After removing it from the plastic, there is a sticker that falls off of the back.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|If you are a Lonley, Bored housewife in an abusive and controlling relationship with \\"Daddy\\" Issues and haven't read a book since Highschool- then this is the book for you!<br /><br />I don't know what is more disturbing- the book- or it's popularity. Since when is  an abusive, controlling man Sexy?  I'm sorry but have we gone completely backwards when it comes to women's rights?  And most disturbing- a woman wrote it!<br />It is poorly written. Obviously it is written by a unaccomplished writer. Reading the first few pages tells me that book gained its popularity on being taboo and the shock value and not because it is written well.<br /><br />The fact that this book tries to make this disgusting controlling and submissive/ Domanearing behavior appear \\"Sexy\\" - is just wrong.<br />What kind of message is this? It's ok to give in to a man that controls every part of your life, dictates what you eat, wear and do, Beats you and punishes you for being disobedient - but as long as he is sexy, rich and occasionally is sweet - then it is ok.<br />WHAT?<br />Why is this book so popular among housewives? I do not get it. Are they so sexually starved and or bored that they find this trash exhilarating? Or is it Peer Pressure all over again? Everybody says its good- if I say I don't then I'm a prude. BS!  Last that I checked - S&M, Submissive and Domineering as a preferred sexual preference is not the \\"Norm\\" for suburban housewives. So why are they saying that they \\"Like\\" this book?<br />By \\"liking\\" this book- the reader is saying that they approve of the behavior and acts in the book.  I'm sorry- any man that likes to control any woman couldn't be further from being sexy.<br /><br />Its like they took twilight, changes the names, removed Vampires and replaced it with S&M and abuse!  This book has the same plot as Twilight-<br />a tall Rich intimidating man,<br />a younger, clumbsy, not-feminine girl<br />He can't control himself around her<br />She Finds him irresistible<br />North West<br />Divorced Parents<br />Quiet dad<br />Dark skinned guy friend that wants her but she thinks of as a \\"Brother\\"<br />Stalking<br />Danger in having sex<br />I could go on and on!<br />This book is a pornographic, version of Twilight.  Get a new plot!<br />At times it even hints of pedophilia!  (she is 21 and he thinks it is \\"HOT\\" when she wears pigtails because she looks YOUnG?)<br />I wanted this to be a good read. I wanted to find out what all the hype was. I was disgusted!  The fact that women all over the country find this book exciting and arousing is sick!  And I am not even speaking of the sexual acts- just the controlling mental and physical abuse is enough to make me vomit!<br />The whole premis of the book is the man is into S and M- he wants to dominate her and enjoys causing her PAIN. She endures it because she wants him.  If this is not the worst kind of relationship- I don't know what is. These types of controlling relationships are the main reason that foundations have built Women Shelters all over the country! To help women in this situation- and now the readers have just gone and glorified it!  If the character was real and a friend of mine- and confided in me- I would do everything in my power to get her away from him!<br />The writer (and all Readers that actually like this trash) should all be evaluated for  mental dysfunction. Seriously!
B0042J6VUS|1.0|This is just a waste of money. When I opened it and tried on my S2 the spring flew..So I wont recommend this item to any one.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|Invincible is an incredible experience.  It sweeps you off your feet and transforms your surroundings to a battlefield, a small Roman village, an anguished emperor wringing his hands as he watches troops swarm the battlements of his city, two lovers striding obliviously through a flower-strewn field...there is no end to the mental destinations that Invincible might take you.  It is not mere music: it is the soundtrack of a life wrought with danger and love.  I would easily pay three or four times as much for this album--and yet it is so inexpensive for over twenty tracks that there is absolutely no reason one shouldn't have this album! Please buy this album, and you will not be disappointed.  Note: if you are a creative sort, this and Archangel (Two Steps from Hell's other album) will inspire you beyond belief.  Also, Invincible is a good album to listen to while reading Vergil.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game u get to play with other people. u hav to draw and they hav to guess! u get to watch as they r drawing and u get to watch them guess at urs.! And the best thing about it.. is its completely free!  I hope everyone gets this app and i hope they enjoy it!
B007SSDS24|1.0|This movie starts out great - but falls apart within the first 15 minutes - what could have been a great plot turns into a spaghetti bowl cheesy lines, trumped up hero scenes, and you see actors flipping charactor attributes almost on a whim - I'd call it a bi-polar plot line - might have worked for the scene but you have to have charactor development - if I could get my $3.99 back I would - don't waste yours on this movie!  THis is the type of movie they out on SciFy channel - late at night to fill in white space  - wallpaper would be more enjoyable to watch!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This app is awesome! Its works great and is sooo fun! if you love to draw I recommend getting this app!

B004YF6MHW|5.0|This app is great! The camera on my Galaxy Attain did not have a zoom and I downloaded this app and it made it zoom. There are a lot of separate \\"packs\\" that you can can download to change your pics and enhance them. Overall, I can say that it is worth it.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I have had this app on both my tablet and Mp3 player for quite awhile now and never had an issue on either.  Some of the issues that people have stated on here have never happened to me.  The updates are few and far between and with both of my devices took less then a minute to download.  I would highly recommend this app.
B006Z7Z3R2|5.0|Ti West's film \\"The Innkeepers\\" is a slow burn from start to finish that grows more and more tense as the film continues. This isn't a horror movie for everyone, however, and I'm sure it will divide most people into \\"love it\\" and \\"hate it\\" camps. It does require a leap of faith and it does take its time, but I thought it was worth it.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray has impeccable sound - as expected from a Blu-Ray - but the audio mix on this film was specifically made to help make this movie a more immersive experience. The film relies heavily on sound and the format accommodates it very well.<br /><br />I got this movie at the pre-order price of $13 and I'm happy I own it. As a horror fan, I can honestly say it is a welcome addition to my collection.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|So effeicient. You only need a flicker of creativity to love this app. Its great for poets and on the go writers.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read all three books fairly quickly, as I couldn't put them down!  It was great reading them on my e-book during a half-hour lunchtime. Of course, I read every chance I could get! The scenario is fairly believable in a not so far from the futuristic world created.  Entertaining and Suspenseful!  I won't give anything away :)
B001HN690O|3.0|I think Jack Black's comical style and identifiable voice makes this movie more engaging than it would be without him.<br />Not one of my personal favorites, but the boys have liked the orig. Kung Fu Panda AND the TV show.<br />Got this for the long road trip to FL -- would have been just as happy to rent it.<br />Movies like Toy Story, Ice Age, and Incredibles have more well-developed story lines, filled with humor, sarcasm and witty dialogue that make it more widely appealing (kids to adults).<br />This movie is not of the same caliber...but, it is a decent show.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I love playing the games and the fact that you can unlock other games. Works very good on the kindle. The reason for me giving three stars is the controls are not very good and those ads are annoying.
075640407X|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me recently and I am very glad he did!<br /><br />I blew through this book in a matter of days (as my husband glared at me while I read till 4am with the light on... oops!)<br /><br />When I was half way through and knew I was hooked, I bought Book 2 so I would be able to jump right to it. (which I also blew through.. now i'm left waiting!)<br /><br />I love the characters and the attention to detail the author has. After finishing a Wise Man's Fear and realizing the depth of those details. I am probably going to read them both again. slower. :)<br /><br />So if you like fantasy, magic, interesting characters and stories, buy this book. You won't be sorry.
B0072NWJRK|5.0|The Peking of 1937 serves as a colorful character alongside the powerful and powerless in this fascinating account of murder, war, politics, depravities and lies, money, and sex.  Clues to the murder are deftly laid out amongst the characters and I found myself reading the book while trying to wash the dishes, intrigued to learn the truth.  What a great read!
B003Y2BMVC|5.0|I rented this on a whim and was shocked by how good it is. First, the steampunk-space-themed animation is gorgeous and original, worth watching even if the movie had no plot. Second, it's a very nice adaptation of Stevenson's story, obviously compressed and slightly Disneyfied, but with the basic psychological drama -- Jim's coming of age and Silver's moral ambiguity -- quite intact. Third, Silver's character is just so well done, dominating the screen visually and in voice acting, just as he does in the book. I have no idea what kids think of it, but for an imaginative adult this is a very fun film.
0345803485|4.0|I was pretty disgusted with this book until approx halfway through. It reminded me of a harder-core harlequin romance and I was merely existing until the next sex scene. However, by the middle, there was enough character development to hook me and take me through to the end. Good read.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I read it, because I wanted to improve communication with my grandaughter.  I found it enjoyable in its own right, even for a 70-year-old grandmother.
0345803493|3.0|I plan to finish the series because there is just enough character and plot development for me to want to see what happens. The sex scenes that were hot in the first book became very repetitive in the second, sometimes making me wonder if I was on an earlier page. I do enjoy the mental pictures of Ana's internal goddess, but I'm tired of \\"Holy F***\\", \\"biting my lip\\", \\"just-f****d hair\\", \\"oh my\\", and MANY others.  Ana's character is also super flaky and contradictory at times, which is understandable; but instead of sympathizing with her, she often just p****d me off. If this book is made into a movie, the screenwriter(s) is going to have to develop the characters and relationship much more---otherwise it'll just end up as a high-budget porno. Definitely not a literary masterpiece, but I still finished it!  Oh, and I have to mention the odd \\"big words\\" thrown into Ana and Christian's conversations here and there. They would just appear out of nowhere and are not typically used in day-to-day conversations. I had to use my \\"define\\" tab several times. I think this was the author's sad attempt to make the book appear as if it's more intellectual and valid as literature without actually having to know how to write.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book was spectacular.  It follows a romance between Wil and Layken who find each and begin to fall in love before life begins to \\"Slam\\" them from all directions.  Wil is not only sexy but is raising his young 9 year old brother every since his parents were killed in a car accident.  His job and responsibilities to his brother come first but this is just a part of what makes Wil so special.  He is kind, strong, and loves to write Slam poetry.  Layken has just moved in across the street when she meets Wil.  Having lost her Dad to a heartattack 6 months before,  the two immediately identify with each other.  Their little brothers are fast to become best friends which continues to have them running into each other.  Wil and Layken's first date is awesome.  Wil takes her to a poetry slam where he preforms a touching poem about his parents death.<br /><br />There are some many twists and turns in the plot that I really want you to experience so I won't write much more about the story.  This is story with real characters that get battered by life but continue on through strength of character.  Many things stand in the way of Wil and Lake's relationship but they continually push through. If you enjoy love stories that have real life characters, this is a book for you.  You will not find silly high school drama in this book but incredibly real life situations that will etch this story on your heart.  This is definitely one for the keeper shelf.<br /><br />The second book, Point Of Retreat, is out and is from Wil's point of view.  I was so relieved and excited that I could immediately read it.  It was so nice that this book was from Lake's POV and the next is from Wil's to give you a chance to get inside both their heads.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is an amazing fun game for all agez im 15 and im addicted lol i recommend  to get this  game
B007V2UGPE|5.0|addicting and free but after you level any thing up so much you have to start useing glu coins to level stuff up.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|most of these kind of games are a boring start becuase you feel so limited to what you want to do. but in this game there is always something happening and so.thing going on.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Finally this app came out! All of my friends have been bragging about playing this on their Apple products,  and finally it comes out on the kindle fire! It works great on the kindle fire,  I can play it for hours and never get bored. Most definitely download it!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I haven't gotten this all nor will I ever get this app because people are saying there's a glitch. come on gameloft!! you can do better than that!
0316044695|4.0|I heard about Luttrell's tale of survival on the web and I must say the story of how he escaped the mountains of Afghanistan is incredible. It goes to show that US SEALs are no joke and that the brutal training they endure equips them to survive perilous situations like this.<br /><br />I'm no expert when it comes to critiquing books so all I'll say is that the writing style was easy to read and to the point. If you're looking for an interesting view into the world of elite special forces this book is for you.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|great new cd by shinedown as good as sound of madness or maybe better really good mix on this cd[[ASIN:B007JCP8FE Amaryllis]]
B007PTJOV0|5.0|yup its just like Mario. lots of fun and easy to play! cant beat free either!the controls take a minute to get used to but they are simple so its no big deal.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Its identical to the play store version if you've sideloaded the game before only now it has a sharper icon
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Cool game. runs a bit slow on some devices but worth the download. make sure to block...it will save u when u fight harder enemies
0345803485|5.0|Well i loved this trilogy!! I love anything sexy and romantic I found Christian a disturb man, but who can blame him. But it's a true love story built on trust and honnesty and she is not taking his crap . I am not a college graduate so some things i had to look up.A lot. But i like that the characters are smart, and she is not this little weepy female. At times yes, but she is strong, capable and analized him so well. The bdsm was lite for me considering was i usualy read. But just enough and written and explained as not to be trashy.<br />I think men should read this and can learn how to treat a women. I know he is arrogant and a bit of a bully, but hey he ADORES her and his basics are good.<br />So heck ya i love these books and will probably reread them in few months. Witch is rare for me.<br />[[ASIN:B007SGM084 Fifty Shades Trilogy Bundle: Fifty Shades of Grey; Fifty Shades Darker; Fifty Shades Freed]]<br />Job well dome Mrs. James.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I have enjoyed re-reading these stories over and over again as well as seeing them on public television. But to have them in a portable format is the best.
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|Great product, fast shipment, great customer service.  This is a great used product no scratches with the art work and a really great price. Thanks for the quality
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|Best adaptation. I love the cast and the soundtrack. Michael Fassbender is the perfect Rochester. I don't know why all the other reviews condemn him.
0345803485|2.0|Seriously?!  I read this book after seeing a segment on the Today Show about the book and when I purchased it, there were less than 300 reviews... that's my excuse.  I can't believe all the buzz about this book, it is crazy that the media is influencing peoples opinions!  Don't buy into the hype... certainly not at this price!  If you wait awhile you can probably pick this book up in a bargin bin or a garage sale!
B006CA5NUY|3.0|This album is pretty good.  It does become a little monotonous after a while though.  The standout track to me is definitely Narcissistic Cannibal.  That song has the new sound but is reminiscent of older Korn as well.  You can tell that they're experimenting with their sound and for the most part it works.  I just wish they would have mixed things up a little more.  Overall, if you are a Korn fan you will probably already have this and if you aren't, I doubt this will change your mind.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Love it! Haven't played this game in years! glad to have it on my kindle! can't wait for more games and apps!
B007V5CF5K|5.0|The game took forever to load...and its a hidden puzzle game that has lots of puzzles to be solved.  A big h/o game for. 99 cents...well worth the money!
B00008G8LG|5.0|They just don't make them like this anymore, and this is a remake.  I can't think of another I like as much.  This one is even better than the original (gasp) The King and I, in my opinion, but only because I never thought they would find anyone as great as Yul Brynner...
B004ZISVWC|5.0|Surprisingly good! When the film started I thought it would be horrible. But overtime it got better and better. Trust me. This film is worth watching.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Oh my...the hunger games was an amazing book!  It was difficult to put it down.  Already bought the next in the series...
B005J4TLQG|4.0|A gritty, oftentimes hilarious UK sci-fi action comedy. It has all the youthful, punky energy of its main characters--a misfit band of wannabe gangsters who take it upon themselves to stop an alien invasion. Wonderful in its inventiveness and narrowed scope, it's the kind of cinematic jolt that you don't often see in the action genre.
0307120007|5.0|I purchased the book Pat the Bunny for my grand-daughters easter basket. She is only 7 months old but she really took to it quickly. Mom is reading it to her on a daily bases and absolutely loves it. Touch and feel books are great for his age group because they can be involved in the book reading too.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Flat out, the best action and stunt sequences of 2011. Anyone who's unconvinced that this type of movie making isn't its own art form needs to watch closer. I've never been a fan of the Fast & Furious franchise, but this movie won me over and then some. Sure, the dialogue's a bit hokey and the acting not exactly Oscar worthy, but that's not the point here. Those stunt sequences, especially the crazy chase that ends the film, are absolutely breathtaking.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Good product for Kindle Fire, works just like it does to view on PC. Easily view documents, very happy I downloaded.
B0051T47NQ|5.0|A jolt of crazy Norwegian filmmaking. This packed more creativity into its limited budget than most huge Hollywood tent poles. It's a simple, yet off-the-wall, story that shifts between talky, near-documentary style background info and deliriously entertaining troll sequences, for lack of a better description. And those troll sequences... well, I won't spoil anything for you, but they're something very, very special. I wish more American films were this creative!
0307463745|1.0|There is nothing in this book worth you time.  It is full of the most conventional \\"unconventional\\" wisdom you can find.  I got the book for free, and it wasn't worth the time it took me to walk across the office to pick it up.  A clear example of the author's idea to charge more for less, or in this case, charge more for nothing.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Both a love letter to and dissection of nostalgia, this little movie managed to be funny, smart and romantic at the same time. This wasn't the type of manufactured romance we see normally in most rom coms. Instead, it was a love for setting--namely, the Paris most of us romanticize (which doesn`t necessarily match up with reality!). More importantly, the film made an astute, and very true, observation about how we long for an imagined past in order to cope with the present.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|It's an alright game. It just takes a little too long to &quot;prepare&quot; the food. But I guess that just makes it more challenging. It was free that's why it got four stars instead of three.
B004LWZW42|5.0|Maybe not the best, but definitely the coolest, X-Men movie yet. Setting this in the 60's, with all its James Bond influences and borderline camp appeal, was a stroke of genius and instantly set this apart from all the other superhero movies clogging the market. A killer cast, a near operatic fall-from-grace storyline and some great action sequences made this the best super hero movie of 2011.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|if you download this be aware you cannot exit the game without doing a hard reset. i tried the shutdown feature on my kindle but when it powered  back up again the game just loaded. doesnt work on kindle. oh and the game is slow and boring and if this decribes you this is the game for you!!!
B0072GPQNG|5.0|A movie about the enduring humanity of those involved with the horrors of war, as evidenced best by a beautiful scene towards the end of the film (without giving anything away, let's just say it involves barbed wire). Sure, it's hardly a new theme, but it's an enduring one. The trick War Horse employs so well is using an animal to give us insight, via vignettes stretching over several years, into the minds and hearts of those on all sides of World War I. Joey the horse is wondrous to behold, but more than anything, he's a blank slate, allowing the audience to impart their own emotions into the story.
1455510319|5.0|This was another Lincoln Lawyer story and I was not disappointed. Great courtroom scenes and wonderful twists and turns. This book is the reason I had so many late nights in bed reading and so many tired morning meetings the next day. Can't say enough good things about it. Always a Michael Connelly fan !!
B007C3TVNA|5.0|Emotionally devastating, and featuring the female performance of 2011 in Tilda Swinton, who opens a side to her that I had never seen before. Working off a script that's largely dialogue sparse, heavy on dramatic symbolism and non-linear in its story, the movie becomes a fever dream of real-life, domestic horror. The dramatic arc is inevitable from the beginning, but still manages to pack a surprising punch. Not recommended for would-be or soon-to-be parents, though! Or maybe it should be?
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|FINALLY!!! :)) yeah! Been waiting for months for this app! I love it! Already bought the newer version.  Can't wait tip Templerun is on here!
B005C7SXMS|4.0|Little can top the first twenty minutes or so. Disarmingly clever, joltingly quick and riotously funny, the movie struggles (understandably) to keep this momentum up. The story's standard coming-of-age fair, though the setting (Wales) is new and the direction often inspired. It's affected, but in the best way, with a 15-year-old narrator that does dry and deadpan better than anyone else in recent memory.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I just wanted to see how it worked and I could not exit the game, I tried shutting it off several times and finally gave up.  I had to wait until I got back home and look up the instructions here.  The kindle was useless until I did that.  Frustrating
B007PTJOV0|5.0|just like Mario bros. great, no lag. love to play on my kindle! recommend to anyone looking to relax with a fun game on kindle or who just wants to kill time! controls are great too
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|588 hours for everything.  not cool.  probably going to uninstall.  waste of space.Aa Aa Aa Aa Aa Aa Aa Aa Aa Aa Aa
B0063IH60K|5.0|Tried several solitaire games recently on my KF and a new cellphone.  This one is tops.  Love the tap feature.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|a+ reminds me of my bills every month. very easy to navigate and east to check in on. ya ya ya
B007SYWFRM|4.0|not as pushy to buy items as other games are. Lets you do quite a bit and earn valuable items with making u feel obligated to actually purchase stuff in order to get more accomplisshed.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it's fun and easy to play I like the challenge of building a town. its fast paced and your energy refils pretty quickly
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|the wait is finally over iv been waiting for this app ever sconce I got ky kindle and now its here yay
B0055SWM08|5.0|It's beautifully crafted with great difficulty scaling, clever puzzles, smooth graphics, pleasant music, and a very satisfying core mechanic. I would recommend a purchase whole-heartedly.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|I appreciate the effort you put into this game. Get rid of the notifications and I'll actually download it. Ruined a good game.
B007M45PMU|4.0|I saw the Lumineers by chance a few years back. They were playing a club we were at in Denver. They play such an amazing live show that I was hooked and immediately started looking for their record! A first album wasn't released until this year though and it was worth the wait! The Lumineers have incredible stage presence and it shows through on the album. They perform with heart and the music plays that way. I loved this album, it reminds me of Mumford & Sons meet The Civil Wars meet their own brand of folk rock. I highly recommend this album but only gave it 4 stars (would have given it 3.5 but can't rate half stars I would however give the vinyl a solid 4 stars the Lumineers have great vinyl sounds) because there is room to grow. This is the kind of album that I find myself loving the more I'm listening to it. So much so that months after writing my original review I'm here to say, I wish I had marked them a 5 instead of a 4. I hope they follow up with an even more inspired sophomore album. I like that folk music is making these strides to modernize without throwing their roots to the wind (\\"country\\" I'm looking at you). This is a fun album and it's a regular during our dinnertime food prep/clean up. Everyone in my house likes it. I look forward to seeing The Lumineers live again and look forward to a sophomore album, hopefully sooner rather than later!
B006M4F67A|1.0|boughttiabut it wont work?????  cant get it tossss tart up ----  ugggg  this app really sucks...yhink i will see if i can get my money back
B0054JZC6E|2.0|it was ok, nothing special, could have been better, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
0385342063|5.0|I'm a huge Sophie Kinsella fan, and this book doesn't disappoint. I love the premise. When Poppy loses her engagement ring during a hotel fire and then her phone is stolen while she frantically tries to find it, it's a stroke of good luck when she finds an abandoned phone in a trash can...a phone that belongs to the former PA for Sam, a high-profile businessman who keeps everyone at arm's length.<br /><br />What follows is a fun, text-filled story. The characters are flawed and quirky, and the situations in which they find themselves are amusing. I love Poppy, who makes me laugh with her snooping and I enjoyed reading as grows into a confident yet still bumbling woman. The mystery of who is trying to sabotage Sam's company adds to the story and gives Poppy and Sam a reason to interact.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I never saw what Poppy saw in her fiance, Mangus. She didn't even seem to like him, and so the struggle with Poppy wanting/trying to forgive him or to choose him seemed far-stretched.<br /><br />The ending is satisfying and downright cute.<br /><br />Fans of chick lit will enjoy this great summer read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I hadn't heard of The Hunger Games before news of the movie started surfacing. At first I was simply going to watch the movie, thinking I had no time to read the books. I am so glad I changed my mind. I quickly read the first book before I went to see the movie. It was easy to read it quickly because I couldn't put it down. While the writing style is not on par with those that would be consider the great authors of our time, the story is never boring and it is easy to follow what is going on. While I enjoyed the second book very much, I would have to say that this is my favorite book of the series. Granted it is not without it's flaws, but those were easy to overlook. Plus, I'm pretty sure every books has \\"flaws\\" of some sort.
0679746323|1.0|864 pages of gossip, lies, slander, and distortions. Chang and Halliday are disgusting lying pigs. The chinese revolution was the most massive powerful people's revolution in human history. Pre maoist china was a literal hell on earth. Massive deaths due to starvation, desease, winter, natural desasters was common. Drug addiction and lack of basic education, patriarchy, female infanticide, bound feet, prostitution aswell.  Fascist government, oppressive warlords, landlords and thugs. The average chinese lifespan was 32 yrs. Mao Zedong led the chinese people to defeat the japanese capitalist imperialist invaders and occupiers and then chase the kuomindang out of the country. They crushed the warlords, landlords and their thugs. The red army fought and chased the u.s. and NATO forces out of north korea. The red army removed the feudal god king dahli llama out of tibet. Thanks to the land reforms and then the peoples communes and the cultural revolution, the lives of the vast majority of people improved. They got universal healthcare and education. Drugs and drug addiction was abolished quickly. The economy grew by 10% every yr. No inflation. A people's participatory socialist democracy/dictatorship created. Political power for workers, peasants, women, and ethnic minorities for the first time in china's history. The problem of feeding the entire population was eventually solved.  Average lifespan in maoist china became 62. Mao Zedong was the baddest mutha on the planet earth.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I love Plants vs Zombies for PC, so I got it for Android.  Plays great, it is so intuitive using the touch to pickup suns and place plants.<br /><br />But every update, and there has been at least 11 or 12 since I've had the game, has completely reset my saved game.  Unacceptable, at least have a very visible and very clear warning to people that an update may/will reset progress.
B0034G4P94|5.0|Great story, good acting, interesting characters. realistic fighting choreography. Two brothers, one a physics teacher and family man fighting to win the 5 million dollar prize to keep his family's home. The other, an atheistic ex marine gone awol due to his entire unit getting wiped out by friendly fire. Fighting to win the money and give it to the widow and children of one his fallen comrades and best friend. And their former abusive alcoholic father struggling to stay sober and change his ways and redeem himself to his sons. Very moving and uplifting film.
B00755646W|4.0|In 1991 I sat down in the movie theatre, very excited to watch truth or dare on the big screen.  Thiat moment in time some might say was a peek for Madonna. (It was the start of her cone bra) I can say it was a very good year. I was in the car with my mom when her first single came out. It made me feel something I had never felt before.(gay feelings?) When she came to Hollywood for her fist concert I was in 6th grade. (Was it the time of my first gay crush?) It was the very first time in ever saw gay teenagers and her cult of  latin boys all over the city of LA wearing belts that spelled boy toy. I guess I grew up with Madonna as my parents grew up with Elvis or the Beatles. I have been there with her and all of her releases since day one.<br />Watching Truth or Dare 20 years + later (now on blu ray) was a intense reflection back on my life and thoughts of what has happened to me  in the last 20 years have come to mind.<br />Madonna has been a time mark or book mark for my life she had been releasing singles and videos since I hit puberty.<br />This truth or dare blu ray might be a peak for Madonna but for me it was a rush of emotions.<br />Might I add it was remastered to look even better then I remember seeing it on the big screen day of release.<br />This was an excellent blu ray purchase!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game need another way to earn. energy<br />and coins and need away to make others visually work on the land
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Thank you for the great offer on The Hunger Games trilogy. While you can't really \\"mess-up\\" a digital book, there is room for improvement. The one thing I would that would have made this a perfect purchase is having the three books show up as separate instead of as chapters in one huge file. Still, thanks for a great price.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|This app is a life saver and I simply love it- no complaints! I would definately recommend it if you haven't tried it already. I'm glad I got it while it was free cuz I got to try it and I don't regret it.
0345803485|2.0|Not a bad story, but the premise is a bit absurd and the writing is awful. The endless use of several phrases and expressions is maddeningly repetitive, as if the author has Turret's syndrome and can't stop herself. Also, the character of Anastasia is a college student, who uses them: holy cow, holy crap, oh my, etc., on almost every page. I teach at three colleges and NONE of my female students would ever use these inane phrases. Also, Anastasia is 22, a virgin and has no computer or cell phone. Absurd, in this day and age. There was clearly no editor on this book, including the author. Any decent writer would have picked up on the redundancy in this book and tried to better it. It's almost as if the author wrote it and then never bothered to read it herself!<br /><br />Christian Grey is a character with almost unlimited wealth, which at 26 is a bit of a stretch. He also is a vain, control freak, ego maniac with severe psychological issues. Anastasia is obsessed with his physicality to the point of lunacy. She never stops commenting on his long fingers, his hair and how \\"hot\\" he looks. She sounds like a 12 year old with a crush on a rock star, not an intelligent woman with a high GPA.<br /><br />I'm not sure why all the housewives in the country have embraced this book. Clearly they must have a high tolerance for bad writing and a need to buy into an adolescent fantasy in lieu of reading good literature. It is a sad statement on the collective taste of the readers in this country.<br /><br />The sexual aspects of the book are very clumsily written, more as if the author did research on S&M, rather than actually knowing anything about it. The scenes that are depicted are mind-numbingly similar and not particularly provocative. Anastasia's use of the term \\"down there\\" sounds like the language of a child, not an adult. It was embarrassing to read such an amateurishly written book. The best part of reading it, was to finish it.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|As a former marine enlisted man and later as an officer, and also as an amateur military historian, I found the DVD series \\"The Pacific\\" to be very enlightening and excitingly entertaining.  It told the stories of men and military strategies and actions that I had only read about in books and magazines.  Watching this close to real portrayal was gut wrenchingly affective.  I marveled at how the ethos, spirit, and expert combat activity of the infantry marines in WWII is still the foundation of the marine corps' \\"fire and maneuver\\" doctrine today; only with far more modern and lethal capability in today's corps. The familiar connection that marines have with the navy is very evident in the movie as it is in real life today. I served in the 1970's in some of the same units revealed in the movie, the 7th marines in particular.  Knowing that my six year service in the corps was standing on their great sacrifices and history, affected me deeply and proudly.  I more than liked this portrayal of the marines that I read about and their units, I cherish it almost as much as I cherish my holy bible.

B000W4KT64|4.0|Last night's bargain-rack DVD was \\"Hairspray.\\" I found it at a Ross Store. Hairspray is a musical and I just don't watch many musicals. Okay, there was \\"Mama Mia\\" and I admit to enjoying it. Well, I'll admit to enjoying \\"Hairspray\\" too. It was a fun movie. Not much depth. So-so acting. Light on the story, but somehow everything seemed to hold  together and it was an enjoyable movie to watch. The actors seemed to be having fun too. It was probably the biggest role of John Travolta's career.<br /><br />Well, what can I say? It was a musical set in Baltimore at about the time that the integration movement was sweeping over the country. Old attitudes and new attitudes were thoroughly mixed and, of course, conflicts of ideas abounded. I'd say it was one of those looking-back things that was almost embarrassing to view. The movie had a sort of frivolous fun feeling and everybody gave the appearance of having a good time. Light, chuckling laughs were abundant. Seeing John Travolta cast as an overweight mother was worth the price of the disc. Where did they ever find a fat suit that large? Of course, it also looked as if he was wearing his own personal fat suit, in addition. Well, it was sing and dance, sing and dance, all with a comical light story to hold things together. It was a pleasant and enjoyable movie, but short of first rate.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I was impressed with the other reviews so went ahead and got this game. Love it!!! Great on my Kindle fire. Great graphics. Great story line.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is the film we knew was coming before they even started to make it. The frequent cameo appearances by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) in all the films hinted at the coming of this film. They goofed, and didn't introduce Fury in the first Iron Man (unless you watched post credits) and forced us to sit through a cliche filled second one so they could fit in Jackson and the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson).<br /><br />Loki, with \\"ancient knowledge and a new purpose\\" has returned (\\"the door opens from both sides\\") and absconds with the Tesseract, a device of unlimited power. Loki is bent upon world destruction/domination. Nick Fury and the Black Widow travel the world to assemble a crack team of superheroes to save the planet. It is during this time we get a brief re-introduction of the characters: The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner introduced in \\"Thor\\") and Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Thor comes in later. He sees the Loki issue as a family problem and doesn't want the Avengers butting in. This creates a brief three sided fight.<br /><br />The film also boasts some good dialouge and many decent one liners especially for those who relish a good chiamus:<br /><br />Captain America: \\"Wait. We have to plan our attack.\\"<br />Iron Man: \\"I have a plan. Attack.\\"<br /><br />The production recreates the quirky characterizations. Iron Man is an egomaniac. Hulk is the reluctant hero. Black Widow is ever confident. Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is sexy and intelligent. Captain America is the naive patriot. Lou Ferrigno (who else could it be?) is the voice of a larger Hulk than in the past. As expected, having a villain with the strength of the gods is not enough. There has to be some minor infighting due to personality differences.<br /><br />The film includes a good blend of action, comedy, great special effects, and has a fairly decent plot at that. It does help to have seen the other films, especially \\"Thor\\", but it is not a requirement if you have some inkling of the superheroes mentioned.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Minor profanity (SOB).\\", but it is not a requirement if you have some inkling of the superheroes mentioned.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Minor profanity (SOB).

B007549W62|1.0|I undestand the message of helplessnes, human depravity and nature, but the film carried it too far, too unrealistic to the point of beint very disgusting. I am throwing the video away. some of the actions taken by the actors was unrealistic, even considering human depravity. It had no social redeeming value whatsoever. I am a movie collector and have some sense of realism, social values and human nature, but this film ultimately has no value to be transmitted to the viewer.
0385523912|5.0|First, the things that were missing:<br /><br />1. An index would have been useful.<br />2. A family tree chart would have been nice. It was hard to keep track of who was related to whom, and a family tree (with the dates of deaths of the characters) would have been nice. The book is good, but it can't be read in one sitting and the relationships start to blur on successive pickings up.<br />3. The author only told us how she came to know these characters at the end of the book. I don't get the impression that she spoke to them in their language (she is the Beijing Bureau chief), and that does make a bit of a difference in how she saw/ heard/ perceived them.<br /><br />This book offers an alternative perspective to BR Myers ([[ASIN:1935554344 The Cleanest Race: How North Koreans See Themselves and Why It Matters (Melville House Publishing)]]). Namely, she seems to disagree with him on the points that: 1. Korea really *was* a nation before the Japanese came and made it one; 2. Communism and Juche are, in some way, taken seriously by the ruling dynasty. (I am not sure how well supported her arguments are, since I don't know how well she can read and how many primary sources she has read about it.) She also concurs that the government is an ethno-nationalist one and Kim Jong-Il just happened to get there by accident.<br /><br />Demick's descriptive ability is astonishing. She seems to do all of it without bombast and she goes more about the business of *showing* the evils of Communism than moralizing about them.<br /><br />After reading this, I can't believe that these things happened, or that a country exists in this way. Or that anyone anywhere is still trying to mount a defense of Communism.<br /><br />In terms of reading time, this book is about 3 afternoons' worth of reading. I bought the book secondhand, but I think it would be worth a new purchase and it is worth a reread.
B0034G4P1W|5.0|Synopsis: In a pirate haven, just as the pirate captain is putting in his application for the Pirate of the Year award, assured by his crew that he's a shoo-in, three other contenders arrive that put his \\"achievements\\" to shame. So he sets out to board more ships in order to gain more gold. No luck. After four failed attempts, he boards a scientific expedition ship, headed by Charles Darwin (yes, that Darwin). Just as Darwin is about to be executed, he notices that the pirate's \\"parrot\\" is actually an extinct dodo and he convinces the captain to take it to London and apply for the Scientist of the Year Award, hoping that it will lead to riches. They do so and they stay at Darwin's home, where a trained chimp wearing a tuxedo and using cards with which to write messages does Darwin's bidding. Queen Victoria takes an odd interest in the rare fowl and that's as far as I'll go with the plot.<br /><br />This animated film is by the same folks that brought you Wallace and Grommit. It is very amusing and well done. As is the case nowadays with most animated features, there are jokes and slapstick elements for the kids to enjoy and quite a few jokes for the adults (we get to see cameos by Jane Austen and the elephan man). Some of the sets have jokes of their own which you have to be on the lookout for because they unfortunately are so fleeting.
B007SSEBCU|4.0|Last week my husband and I watched this film.  As always Meryl Streep was wonderful as the \\"Iron Lady\\".<br /><br />Although the film was a little choppy in that it did not fully develop the relationship between daughter and mother in the absence of the obvious favorite \\"son\\", I found it to be very enlightening from a historical stand-point.<br /><br />I realize it took artistic license in some cases, but all in all I thought it was a very well written film and again, the acting was wonderful by Ms. Streep and the supporting cast as well!<br /><br />(We purchased the actual DVD. We did not use the instant video option.)

And I'm really glad I did. Now I just wish there was more.  I loved the characters evolution and growth, they are complex and from their shaky start comes a deep bond.

B005IQZB14|5.0|This is an incredibly well written book. Cheryls descriptions of pretty much everything left me breatheless. I have read several books since this one, all of them with 5 star, or close ratings. They all felt like high school english papers compared to this.<br /><br />I have spent a lot of time in the wilderness, hiking and rafting so I very much enjoyed the subject matter. However, even if you have no interest in the subject matter, read this book for the sheer beauty of the writing. Each sentence is a marvelous delight. I don't say that pretty much ever.... A must read. Thanks Cheryl, I can't wait to read more of you.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Several of my female friends were going on and on about how amazing this book was so I decided to find out what all the fuss was about.  I just finished reading it and I'm still wondering.  I think it had potential but it wasn't even close to being realized.  Other reviewers have mentioned the fact that certain phrases are very much overused but that's kind of an understatement.  After reading the first book in this trilogy the only thing I can say is I have an overwhelming urge to slap Ana's inner goddess while rolling my eyes and biting my lip.  Truly a waste of time and money which is sad because I really wanted to fall in love with this book.  Call me fifty shades of confused as to why people are raving about this drivel.

B007OUFESC|2.0|I could not wait for this movie to open. It sounded so good, with an excellent cast.<br />But it turned out to be more boring than anything else.

It was hard to believe<br />such an apparent nut case could turn out to be the professional she is later in the movie.

0439023521|3.0|After all of the hype, and with the upcoming movie, I decided to give this book a try.  It was a good story with an interesting premise, but I almost felt like I was reading the Cliff's Notes version.  There just wasn't enough detail or description in this story to satiate my curiosity.  Still, in spite of that, it was a very quick and engaging read.  Not sure if I will read book 2 and 3 of this trilogy.

B004RC8NUQ|3.0|The friend I was staying with this weekend, who I shall call R, encourages my worst pop culture impulses. Or perhaps I encourage hers. Either way, we decided we needed to view a double billing of No Strings Attached and [[ASIN:B00650SSDU Friends With Benefits]].<br /><br />All four lead actors (Natalie Portman, Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis, Justin Timberlake) were charming. Portman's Emma was my favorite character. She's brilliant, driven, and the movie doesn't make her sacrifice her career for true love. Justin Timberlake's Dylan was probably my least favorite, for reasons explained later. Therefore, No Strings Attached wins the leads.<br /><br />Both films have terrific supporting casts. I loved the side characters in No Strings Attached - Emma's neurotic med student roommates, Adam's friends with bad advice, coworker Lucy, and Kevin Kline as one of the worst parents ever. Then Friends with Benefits's came along with Woody Harrelson as a manly, openly gay coworker and Richard Jenkins as Dylan's father with Alzheimer's. Plus, there's tons of brilliant cameos. Friends with Benefits wins secondary characters.<br /><br />Final category: story. In No Strings Attached, Emma and Adam have been casual acquaintances for years. After beginning a casual sex relationship, Adam clearly wants something more while Emma isn't ready to make an emotional commitment. While both of them come close to screwing things up, neither makes a truly awful mistake. Friends with Benefits's Dylan and Jaime become friends first, then decide to sleep together. They obviously become something more, but Dylan isn't ready to admit it - which causes him to say some very hurtful things about Jaime. She, of course, overhears them. That scene felt cliche and made me dislike Dylan, but overall Friends with Benefits was funnier, more realistic, and had a truer emotional core. Thus, Friends with Benefits wins, by a hair, the better storyline.<br /><br />I slightly preferred No Strings Attached and R felt the same about Friends with Benefits. But both of us agree that if you're going to watch a 2011 romantic comedy, it should be [[ASIN:B0060V1WJ6 Crazy, Stupid, Love]]. Also, Thor had a terrific trailer.

B005J4TLQG|5.0|Attack the Block, like Drive, tops my list of best 2011 movies. The director, Joe Cornish, and most of his cast might be new to movies, but Attack the Block is brisk and assured. There's no padding to this socially-aware monster movie.<br /><br />The eponymous block is a council estate - think projects - in South London, where Moses (John Boyega) and his four friends live. Attack the Block opens when they mug Sam (Jodie Whittaker), a young nurse who recently moved into the block. Immediately after a dog-sized creature falls from the sky and the boys easily kill it. Both of these actions have repercussions that last throughout the movie.<br /><br />You see, that wasn't the only alien to come to Earth - and the others aren't so easy to kill. I love the monster design in Attack the Block. It's a low-budget movie, but being able to see nothing of the creature but a glowing mouth is extremely effective. If you're concerned about watching a horror film, Attack the Block is neither gory nor super scary. There are some effective shocks and a few violent kills, but that's not the true focus of the movie.<br /><br />Most of the attention is given to the humor and the setting. Attack the Block is produced by the same people as Shaun of the Dead, after all. Whenever things get too tense, there's a Brewis (Luke Treadaway) scene to lighten the atmosphere. (Brewis is a rich kid who went to buy weed for a party at the wrong time.) The girls who act as a counterpart to Moses's gang are also delightful. The dialogue, almost entirely in the chav vernacular, is pretty easy to pick up and helps the block feel fully realized.<br /><br />I think a council estate is a wonderful setting for a horror movie.  It's claustrophobic but still allows for movement.  (Chase scenes are essential.  Attack the Block has some great ones.)  The balance between the gang and Sam shifts throughout the movie but it never feels like the story is trying to have its cake and eat it too.  There's more to the gang than violence, but Sam doesn't have to forgive them just because they had their reasons.  What Moses, Pest, Biggz, Dennis, and Jerome did was wrong and Attack the Block never pretends it wasn't.  It just acknowledges people can do good things and bad things.  Thugs can care about and protect their home.<br /><br />Actions have consequences and those consequences can make for a terrific movie.g than violence, but Sam doesn't have to forgive them just because they had their reasons.

B0030U1TW0|5.0|Good packaging - Great CD that gets into the more progressive works of Gentle Giant. Love their style and quality of work. Where are they now?
B004EPZ07K|2.0|I may not be qualified to speak about Green Lantern since I feel asleep for half an hour in the middle of the movie. But that says quite a bit in itself, because I have a high tolerance for terrible movies. I'll give Green Lantern credit for having one of the best lines ever uttered in a superhero film:<br /><br />  What do you mean? I've known you my whole life! I've seen you naked! You don't think I would recognize you because I can't see your cheekbones?<br /><br />Of course, it is said by Blake Lively as Carol Ferris, ace fighter pilot and successful business woman. Blake tries her hardest, but she's not very convincing as the tough-as-nails Carol. She comes off as a bit of a marshmallow. As for the central character . . . Hal Jordan has never been my favorite Lantern. And the movie takes way too long to make Hal seem like a good candidate for the ring. As for the daddy issues everyone in the film is suffering from: Iron Man did it better.

B004LWZW42|5.0|X-Men: First Class is the fifth X-Men movie and serves as a mingled prequel/reboot. There are those who insist it's not a true prequel due to continuity snarls, but let's face it: superhero stories and continuity snarls go together like ice cream and cake. You either accept that the two things are meant to be or you have very odd taste. The movie has a very different line-up for the team than the comic it is based on, but I thought they picked a nice mix of personalities and powers and hired a great cast. The movie objectively had issues, however. Some of the character arcs happened too quickly. By the end, the white guys were the only people left on the \\"good\\" team.<br /><br />But all objective problems were obscured by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender's terrific performances as Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr. I grew up watching the (nineties) X-Men cartoon on Saturday mornings. I still have fond memories of Professor X and Magneto taking on dinosaurs together. McAvoy and Fassbender captured their intense friendship and underlying ideological differences perfectly.<br /><br />The rest of the cast does a good job, too.  Kevin Bacon is always a great villain, of course, and Jennifer Lawrence has a great career ahead of her.  I'm looking forward to the sequel!
B005RJ6DUK|4.0|I have never seen this movie, and a friend kept talking about it.....what a great story! And the cast is superb!
B0034G4P8A|4.0|Marvel's first and most successful release of 2011 was Thor, directed by noted-Shakespearean Kenneth Branagh and starring newcomer Chris Hemsworth. There was a lot to like about this movie. I thought the relationships were a strong point, as were the characters themselves. Tom Hiddleston had a tough role as Loki, but he managed to make the villain sympathetic and there was a nice mix of love and jealousy between him and Thor. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and Darcy (Kat Dennings) added a lot of humor and it was nice to see a female friendship showcased in a superhero film.<br /><br />Sometimes the scenes in New Mexico dragged a little, but not terribly. Thor was certainly fun, but there was nothing that made me love it.  It did, however, increase my excitement for The Avengers.
B001EYU1VO|5.0|I ordered one of these flight sticks in 2009 to use with rise of flight iorn cross.I used it 4 or 5 nights every week to play the sim and other flight sims like HAWX 1 and HAWX 2 it was perfect for these sims that do not use alot of buttons to controll the aircraft.Don't get me wrong you could play alot of other sims with it thats just my thing.I like flight sticks like the ch products fighter stick with pro throttle and pro rudder pedals to play sims like A10 warthog or wing over europe and sims like these that have much more aircraft controll to setup.For sims like rise of flight and HAWX it's perfect.You have the right amount of buttons for the sim and it's easy to setup and use.<br />For the sims like A10 warthog you will need more controlls than this flight stick offers.The saitek X52 and X52pro are very good also and I use the X52 all the time as well for sims like wings over vietnam and strike fighters 2 and I love it as well but you will not find a better flight stick or throttle and rudder pedals than what ch products have to offer.I like this brand the best overall but it is overkill for sims like rise of flight with WW I aircraft with limited controll needs.<br />Only time tells the truth about how well something will last and this cyborg f.l.y 5 has lasted from 2009 till now for me and thats why I ordered another one to replace it when it did finaly give out.I used it alot but I did take care of it the best I could.It has been a solid easy to use flight stick and I never had one issue with it.I was playing rise of flight one night and it just stopped working at that was that.I feel I did get good use out of it for what I paid for it as long as it lasted with as much use as it had.<br />If you need something easy to use this is plug and play.It dose last well and it fits your hand well.You can get to all the buttons easy and I love it for some sims but not all sims.

B004X6PRO6|3.0|The Orphan Master's Son is a well written, well composed novel. One can only suspect that it mirrors realitiscally the life that goes on \\"behind the wall\\" of North Korea. Although there are \\"flashes\\" of hope, often in simple domestic relationshipw, one is so overcome by the bruality, the starvation, the hopelessness of the people, that I unlike Erin Burnett of CNN who had wished it had gone on 100 pages longer, wished it had been 100 pages shorter. I think the point of the novel, which was short on plot and long on horrific descriptions, could have made its point with less ink.<br />If you want to envision what hell on earth is like... read the book.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Drive was one of my favorite movies of 2011. I didn't know much about the story when I went to see it, which is the way it should be. (The trailer gives away several of Drive's surprises.) I only knew my best friend begged me to see it so that she would have someone to discuss it with. I can never resist pop culture that I might be able to dissect with someone.<br /><br />Drive is obviously influenced by the 80's, from the neon pink credits to the synthpop soundtrack and score that brings to mind classic soundtracks like Thief done by Tangerine Dream. It is a shame that Cliff Martinez's score wasn't eligible for the Academy Awards, because the music in Drive works beautifully. (Apparently there was too much non-original material, which doesn't really make sense to me, since Ludovic Bource's score for The Artist was eligible. It contains music by Duke Ellington and others, as well as using the Vertigo score. Good music, but you can't say it was all written for the movie.)<br /><br />In addition to great music, the cinematography of Drive will knock your socks off. It's a beautiful movie. Well edited, too. Many have accused Nicolas Winding Refn's film of being too technical and cold. I find his precision appealing and enjoyed the characters, good and bad, too much to consider the film cold.<br /><br />Drive's cast includes Ryan Gosling, Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaacs, Ron Perlman, and Christina Hendricks. It's a long list of recognizable names used well. While Drive is set in Los Angeles, you'll never feel that anyone looks too Hollywood. You might not believe this if you've seen the trailer, but the acting is subtle. These are not people who wear their emotions on their sleeves, but that doesn't mean they aren't being driven by their passions.<br /><br />If you like movies with chase scenes, you might find Drive frustrating at first. Refn goes for something more real than constantly exploding cars. But if you like love stories or noir films and can handle a bit of creative violence, you'll love Drive.ms and can handle a bit of creative violence, you'll love Drive.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|This is a great game and I love to play it! But on three separate occasions I have open this game to play and all my data has been erased for not apparent reason. That Sucks Big Time :-(
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Captain America: The First Avenger was the third Marvel movie to hit theaters in 2011 and the last film leading up to The Avengers in May 2012. I did not know what to expect from this one at all. I vaguely knew Captain America's origins, but he's never been a superhero that caught my interest. I fell in love with the character over the course of the film. Steve Rogers is simply a good person who goes out and does the right thing, even if it means great risk to himself. It's hard not to rally around a character like that.<br /><br />Plus, it's a fun film.  The bad guy (Red Skull) is over the top.  Captain America's team, the Howling Commandos, are a diverse group of competent soldiers and wisecrackers.  You can see Tony Stark in Dominic Cooper's performance as Howard Stark.  Peggy is a brilliant character: focused, intelligent, and getting the job done.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite superhero movie.  And I love superhero movies.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|Book contains stories which many should find entertaining and interesting of simpler times when children could entertain themselves and each other without the necessity of political correctness now pervading modern society. Highly recommended for anyone from senior primary age up.
1572814349|5.0|I really love these cards.  The artist has used images from Medieval paintings together with digital collage to make a beautiful deck based on the Waite-Smith imagery but with an antique look.  The gilded edges are a lovely touch, and the color gold is everywhere.  And may I say that I love the packaging?  I've been disappointed recently when I've bought lovely decks with cheap packaging, but the very sturdy box with the removable lid that comes with this deck feels almost like a little treasure box and is a work of art in its own right.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a really great game. its been fun for me and the kids. we can not seem to quit playing it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|ive been waiting so long for this app to be available for the kindle fire! its so fun and fantastic!

1475071884|5.0|This review is  written by my daughter: Pollyanna is a great book about a girl named Pollyanna Whittier, whose parents are dead. Her mother,the daughter of a rich man,was asked to marry a rich man. But she did not like him. Jennie chose to marry the more kind minister who was kinder to her. But all her babies died  except her last child Pollyanna.Pollyanna's dad also dies, and the child goes to live with her Aunt Polly,and her maid Nancy. Towards the end of the book ,Pollyanna is hit by a car, and is paralyzed. This event causes strict Polly to get nicer, play Pollyanna's glad game. Pollyanna goes to a doctor instead of continuing with house doctors. Pollyanna's aunt gets married now in front of her bed. Pollyanna is able to walk again, and goes happily home, wanting to never ride and always walk. And guess what, Pollyanna is glad that she lost her legs because you don't know how lovely it is to have legs until you've lost them for a while.
B005TBQS0Q|5.0|One of Robin Williams greatest movie ever made. He had made many of our men who served in Vietnam laugh at very hard times.  Good Morning Vietnam will make you laugh and cry. Great movie!!!
B007VGXS8M|2.0|Have you read these reviews?  Some I think are real and helpful but all these 5 star ones that say nothing.  It makes the reviews and the game look bad.  The game keeps freezing.  Don't be fooled by the fake 5's and save you 99 cents.
B004EJUMT2|5.0|Saw the band for the first time in Oakland, CA. I've read all the reviews and all the labels applied to their music, but as an old rock and roller of the 60's, this was great music, regardless of how you label it. A unique, fun stage appearance that was captivating and, most of all, entertaining. They were the first band on the show followed by Mastadon and then Opeth, but for my money, I enjoyed the music of Ghost most of all, so much that I bought their CD at the show. After decades of rocking an rolling and countless concerts, I didn't think there was anything left to spark my interest and open new doors, but this band certainly that. Dig it, man, far out and stuff. As a God fearing Catholic, I was certainly not offended in any way, after all, it's only rock and roll! See them, feel them, touch them; they will heal you! (With apologies to The Who)
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|biggest problem with this game is if you ever get desprate and buy the credits to get the. &quot;cash&quot; if you don't use it immediately it seems to disappear .... I bought 10 either yesterday or the day before and now its already gone when I only used 5 of them.... very confused considering dumping the game completely due to my addiction and not wanting any lurs to spend money on a game that's just stealing it from you
B0079R8IYW|3.0|I operated a Kindle Fire satisfactorily for 4 months without a cover.  This is a major improvement in portability and viewing angles.<br /><br />This Marware Exchange is described as the \\"Stylish\\" model of their 5 Kindle Fire versions, and I agree, it is stylish.  Smooth imitation leather, fast magnetic close (instead of zipper or strap close), smooth interior.  Three viewing angles ---stand at 80 degrees, lie 20 degrees, and flat.  Three business card slots, and a cash size slot for cash and documents.  For a mobile person who wants a professional appearance at an excellent price, this is it.<br /><br />Would be a 5 star, except that the leather surrounding the screen is too close to the border and sometimes interferes with touchscreen on the borderline menus, which are frequent. If this product was made with 1 mm less leather on the sides, would be a 5 star.  Might be better for those with smaller fingers.  Other Marware models might not use this surrounding leather.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have read A LOT of books in my lifetime, some of them good, some not so good; but I don't have enough words to express how awful this truly was! I don't know what baffles me more, that there are actually people who gave this a good review, or the absolute lack of imagination and skill that went into writing this pathetic excuse for a book! Not only did I have flashbacks of the unpleasant memory of reading \\"Twilight\\", but I actually found myself wishing I were reading it instead (which, by the way, seems like a masterpiece compared with this)! The vapid character, 'Ana', has the vocabulary of a ninety year old British grandmother, who's only talent seems to be the ability to blush excessively and gasp a lot! She makes \\"Bella Swan\\" seem like Madonna! The plot is ridiculous and unbelievable! Christian Grey is supposed to be the millionare heartthrob who sweeps Anastasia off her feet. Instead, he's like a bipolar Jekyll and Hyde, who also does a lot of 'gasping' at absurdly placed moments! Do not waste your time!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I am so glad they finally made this game for the kindle fire! everything works well in this game:) u should totally get it

B003Z0D4SM|5.0|I may not have read this book had it not been recommended to me. I'm glad that I did. I agree with many people that claimed that the beginning was slow. However I must say that readers must be patient for it may not be what most North American readers are used to, especially since it has become a standard that a novel must have a hook near the beginning. But the story gets better and the pace picks up gradually.<br /><br />The characters are interesting, and although there was a bit too much narration in some areas, it did not distract me from the plot. Nor did it prevent me from enjoying the story. I'll be definitely checking out the other two novels in this series.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks.. when there isnt a sad ending. I like to finish reading the book in a happy mood and i definitely did. It kept me reading more and more until I couldnt keep my eyes open. I almost dont want to see the movie because the book is so detailed and great.
B001QWBM62|5.0|To be fair, with my rating, as above, I'm venting my frustrations, here, with the totally inadequate manual that comes with this device. This unit may be really great, but I can't tell, because of the almost indecipherable manual. That manual has 152 pages and, in its great verbosity, it explains, very poorly, how to operate this unit.  Yeah, this thing can do just about everything except cook you a gourmet meal, I guess, BUT, you need to slog through pages and pages of material to even begin to approach a rudimentary grasp of its mind-boggling features.  Going through the menus are incredibly tough and not exactly intuitive.  Some are counter-intuitive:  One button does one thing in one mode and something totally unrelated in another mode.  The manual just confuses you by slapping everything together. The \\"support\\" from the manufacturer is that in name only.  Going to their website you will find there basically is no support, save the horrible manual that you can download.  Have you ever been to Jamaica and tried to figure out what the locals are saying, right to your face, in Patois? Frustrating as hell.  You can make out many of the words but, to save your life, you cannot grasp the meaning of what's being said to you.  That is what the manual is like, in many cases.  There is hope, though.  Go to the main user group sites out there. They will help you, greatly.  Do go to them before you start tearing your hair out in frustration.  (I had the links in my original review, but Amazon pulled them.  Nice.) It is very telling that support groups exist for this line of recording devices.  What comes through in most postings is that scores of folks cannot use the manual to figure out much about the unit.  Once I have a good understanding of how to use this unit, I'll update, here. UPDATE: 5/10/12:  OK, I added another star.  While the manual is terrible, I am now figuring things out for myself and I'm starting to like this unit, more.  Expect another update once I teachmyself how to use the multitrack features. UPDATE: 8/16/12:  I have now given this unit 5 stars.  I am using it in multitrack mode to make excellent quality demos.  It does the job in very fine fashion.  It is worth repeating that the manual is very frustrating to use. After having it for a few months, though, you will learn, on your own, as I have, how to navigate the menus, and that will greatly increase your enjoyment of this unit.
B0071T4BVC|5.0|Paul McCartney continues to please.  If you haven't heard his music for a while, do it soon..he is still a true artist with his words and his music.
B005XOPEOU|5.0|I hadn't heard much about this CD prior to purchasing it, but I love all of Coldplay's other albums and since it was on sale I decided to splurge.  I ABSOLUTELY love it!  It definitely lived up to my expectations and was comparable to Coldplay's other music.
B006IDG2T6|1.0|The worse thing I can say is that I did not finish this book.<br /><br />The following quote from the book stopped me, when describing a specific set of individuals who had committed a heinous crime... \\"As sickening as I find their behavior, I have to admit that if I were to trade places with one of these men, atom for atom, I would BE him:  There is no extra part of me that could decide to see the world differently or to resist the impulse to victimize other people.\\"<br /><br />I decided this book offered no edification on my behalf, either I am too wise or too dumb.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great variety of games!  Also not too easy but not impossible to accomplish! Would recommend to anybody looking for something different to play, and my kids love it.
B00634GHJA|5.0|I transfer pics and videos from.my phone to my kindle fire and it works great! never had any problems with it
B007V2UGPE|5.0|It was a fun game I recommend it to every one because it has good graphics and it was just a straight up fun to play.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have never been able to keep ear buds in my ears, so I end up going with something like these. I have tried many other headphones over the years, some costing up to 200 dollars. I always end up putting these on. They are extremely comfortable, and sound better than many of the high priced headphones that I have used. I usually get about a year of regular use out of them before the plug starts going bad, though my current set is 3 years old and still going strong. At about 10 bucks, they are cheap enough that I can keep a spare stashed in my car in case I forget to grab a set on the way to the gym. Seriously, Sony has been making this model for years, and I hope they continue long into the future.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Now you can tend to an entire settlement! Fun if you don't feel the need to shell out real money for playing beyond when you virtual energy is depleted.
B00722ZHG6|5.0|I can't believe she's only 15! She has a great voice for her age and the album is pretty solid. I got to know her thanks to the Hunger Games soundtrack, and I immediately bought her album, and I don't regret.<br />Her self-titled album, \\"Birdy\\" consists of covers from singers and bands from the indie scene like The Naked and Famous, The XX, Phoenix, Fleet Foxes and others.<br />Even if the album is a \\"cover album\\", Birdy proves that she can make a song that was not released by her like she wrote it, the music is very relaxing, perfect for a Saturday night when you stay at home, and I play the album at least once a day. Addicted? I think so.<br /><br />Buy it, you won't regret :)

B006OOHYIC|5.0|new obstacles and kindred raindrops combine for an even better game than the first one - which is a rather difficult task to accomplish.  kudos to the developer.  can't wait for the next one.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this app is really fun!! it's kind of like words with friends but with drawings. you draw a picture then the other player guesses what it is. really good graphics too!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|wonderful game.  beautiful setting.  really makes you think.  one of the best games out there. the sequel is great also.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|well, they finally put it on kindle fire I thank you for doing that because I have be wanting this app for a very long time! it also runs very smooth everything is just great about this app &quot;draw something&quot;
B005HEU7PC|4.0|These are fun to watch again. I have vague memories from the late '80s when I first saw them, interrupted from time to time by family life. Our older kiddos enjoyed them, too.<br /><br />But watching this episode again put the name of a movie (?) in mind. With regard to Billy Campbell's character Okona and his interactions with some female Enterprise crewmembers, all I can think of is,<br />\\"Earth Girls Are Easy\\". I never saw this, but who hasn't heard of it? And I can't find fault with the Enterprise ladies. I mean, look at him! lol<br /><br />I also remember enjoying Data's search to understand humor. Quite poignant, really.<br />A nicely written, if somewhat cliché, episode. As always, great acting.
0783222149|1.0|This lamebrain stinker is pathetic, illogical, and ridiculous. Streep should be ashamed of this one but she probably needed a payday. Among the many laughable moments is near the climax when the husband miraculously manages to get miles and miles downstream on foot along a rough, cliff enclosed, wild river far ahead of a raft running the rapids. He must have flown, taking his dog with him.  Absurd. Then he sets an unlikely trap with barrels on the cliff that Streep rows the raft over to from mid river, then she fishes a gun out of the river with the little boy, a true Hercules, pulling a cable to bring the raft through the rapid water over to the gun. Whoever dreamed up this joke of a film must have been smoking a lot of dope, and made a dopey movie for dopes.
B0060ANY16|4.0|This is a typically good recording from an extremely tight band. Derek Trucks guitar playing is excellent. The only low note is that at times it gets a bit to self indulgent.

B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I have read many of the comments and it seems there are quite a few ppl who have the same problem I do. I was able to play this a few times before it kicked me out. At first it said I needed to free up some space on my kindle fire so I did and it just didn't work. Now its just a black screen when I open it and it takes me back home. I guess this also happened to my friend who has the iphone. PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM!! I love playing this game!
B005LLXB9K|5.0|This is a must have for any fan of Pearl Jam or any fan of music in general!!!! You can't go wrong with this movie and how it exemplifies true modern day musicians and artists!!! Being from Missoula, Montana, we understand what Pearl Jam means to us and how much they care for what is right and what is just!!!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|i like it its fun but it can be a little annoying. cuz it makes me die when im not even near an enemy and occasionaly it glitches please fix it will b 5 stars if yu fix it thank you!!!!!! :)
B004A9F9ZI|4.0|I barely watched the first episode for Season 1, and i gotta say simply magnificent. The story is good, there's a lot of suspense, keeps you thinking between \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\"<br /><br />I bought the season 1 HD (Amazon Instant Video), and i have to say some scenes are not so HD like. And yes, i do have a fast internet connection. I experience scuffs in a couple of scenes. My only explanation would be if by HD, this shows it in 720p, and not 1080. For the most part though, the show will grab your attention and those scuffy HD scenes may not bug you.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really fun and its great for preteens I like it.  but for anyone who likes playing games in the palm of your hands this is the game for you.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game!!! Super addicting, and works great on a kindle fire. If u don't know about this game and u don't play it ur missing out on a lot of fun!
B0050KEVO6|5.0|This game was a lot of fun to play with other people. It's cool how different people come up with random combinations that work. I do think the free version of this game would benefit from a &quot;list&quot; if the elements that we're trying to make. But hey, it's free so I really can't complain.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Great app I love it!!! My friends all love it as well. It is so much fun to play. My whole family loves it!!!!!!!!!!
B004T2QZL8|4.0|This was a fun game and the graphics were nice. However, I do wish there was a list that you could access at all times to show you all the elements that still needed to be made. The hints would often just show you the same item to create over and over again which got old after a while.
0307959856|2.0|Saw this at the bookstore and thought this might be a good read.  Mistake.  No plot. I was twitching as I read Darcy and Elizabeth dialogue---painful.  I wish modern authors would stay away from Jane.  They pale in comparison to her and other top mystery writers.  I've read other PD James and they are ok.  I just prefer Anne Perry.  Much more complex.  Sorry PD.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|this is a good weather app, but check out these outrageous permissions.  uninstalled until this app is no longer allowed to take over my device.
B0063GORYU|4.0|A very relaxing game. Requires some thought but not a big brain teaser. Good for sitting back and enjoying a quick card game. A nice pastime.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|hurray they finally got draw something for the kindle! I was kind of regretting not getting an ipad because of the kindle market's lack of games. Im feeling better now
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is so fun! there are so many games just in this one app I couldn't wait yo start playing I just hats all the adds
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|An excellent buy!  A good read, and it was great to purchase the trilogy for under $20 bucks for my Kindle.  I highly recommend the Hunger Games to all Amazon readers.  I'm more of a \\" mystery/thriller\\" reader but have to say that I really enjoyed this series.  Amazon.....you rock.  You make it so easy to purchase the coolest of things!
0345803493|1.0|This book is written pretty poorly.  The same dialogue occurs every 1-2 pages.  It  reminds me of the movie groundhog day.  Don't waste your time reading
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this is a cool app! some of the games are kinda hard though. I play it with my 6 year old and he loves it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|if u like Mario then u will love this game. definitely a time killer when you are bored. love it
B007V2UGPE|4.0|this game has become my latest addiction!!! it has great graphics and simple game play!  I would recommend this game!
0553801473|5.0|I liked this book. I thoroughly enjoyed the Theon chapters and the Cersei Chapters. I did not like the Dany  chapters too much, though I understand why her chapters seem to be moving slower compared to the rest. I think it has to deal with the timeline. Argument could be made that Dany chapters could have been completely omitted, but I feel the problem then would have been developing her character as a leader and introducing real struggles associated with it. I think what happened is GRRM still wanted to finish the series in 5 books when he finished the 3rd book. He packed too many events into that one book. So for people who have no interest about the world of Westeros and only want to know what happens to their favorite character, this book seems slow and uneventful. The standard set by Clash of Kings and Storm of Swords is pretty high, and people who expect the same amount \\"action\\" in the following books will be disappointed. From what I understand, in this series, things do not happen in random fashion or for no reason. Other (Often times a chain of) events normally leads into a particular event. A Dance with Dragons expands the World of Westeros, gives the reader an understanding of where Dorne stands in the Game of Thrones and builds the premise for book six which bears the promise of having two epic battles.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I don't really have anything to say except that I love this app and lets all try to get it up to five stars!!:)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is awesome! The games are hard @ first when you start&hellip;&hellip; but then once you know how to play them it's fun!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|:) this app is really cool and is definitely a great time killer!  download this app for sure!!  do it do it!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|so far its fun and full of games I enjoy. Pretty easy to use includes new games I've never played.
B007R41E8O|4.0|Great game but didn't get the ending. If u do tell me but u should get it it is challenging and fun.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|The people that put that they don't know where the hints are&hellip;then its your fault for bein lazy and not looking! The hints are in the journal and with its help I finished easily. Its so fun I could play it again and again!! (which I do btw)

B0039NAUZK|3.0|The whole sub-plot of Dana's ex blackmailing her has nothing to do with the main story. I *have* to find out what happens to Jack, but at this point, I am skipping through The Dana & Cole Show portions. I miss Ricky Schroeder, Freddie Prinze Jr is okay and all, but I juuust don't give a NYC rat's azz about his character.<br /><br />The President Hassan guy has THE BIGGEST HAIR IN THE WORLD! Like, distractingly big; when he's on screen, all I can do is stare at his GIANT HAIR, and think, \\"dafuk?\\" Hassan's Hair should have it's own billing.
B000LPS4BG|5.0|Greatest movie of all time... if you haven't already seen this movie, just buy it because you won't regret the purchase.<br /><br />Enough said.
B003BI97DY|3.0|The character of Hastings, director of CTU...ugh. Boring and...I dunno ...UNDER acted? He says every line in ~exactly~ the same way.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|This was the first of Jodi Picoult's books that I read.  This story stirred concerns on many levels.  In any serious situation in a family, if one person is ill or in trouble, the whole family is involved and suffers along with the victim.  The situation in this book is no different than in real life.  What makes this book a good read is how Jodi Picoult depicts each member of the family and how each one deals with a terminal illness.  I couldn't put it down -- I had to know how all of this turned out.  And the ending was totally unexpected!

B004J64QR4|3.0|As I was watching this I was really disappointed with Marius. Not just the singing, but the lack of affect in performance. The actor/singer doesn't respond to the others in any way.<br /><br />Then I read the other reviews that it was Nick Jonas. Clearly the producers went with flashy casting instead getting a solid anchor.<br /><br />Bummer. I wish I could insert a younger Michael Ball in the role. He was outstanding in the 10th anniversary version.<br /><br />However, this Cosette is miles better than the 10th anniversary one.<br /><br />In general, this cast is more age-appropriate than the 10th anniversary, though I think the vocal talent was generally better in the 10th.<br /><br />So, 3 stars. Good, but not great.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is one of those prophetic Novels in the vein of Atlas shrugged or 1984, that takes us through a progression out of tyranny, and the struggle to cast it off. The Characters are well defined and steeped in purpose. My kind of thriller.
1416968725|5.0|Great entertaining book for the 3-6 age group. Easy to follow and so engaging for kids. Story of an egg with a surprise ending.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have been waiting for this app to b on the appstore for my kindle fire n finally it is.... this app is great
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It's offensive because of the writing.  It was incredibly poorly written...  and sadly, this review is coming from someone who can't write herself.  Now THAT is saying something.  Unfortunately, each page read was predictable.  Repetitive.  And.  Just.  Simply.  Annoying.  In fact, I found the writing distracting and slightly laborious to read.<br /><br />However, good for the author.  We're talking about the book, spiking curiosity, and making her loads of money.  Who is laughing now?
B007M6P01O|5.0|Started watching season 1 by accident but got quickly hooked on the story and the characters.  Totally into it now, can wait for season 3..<br />I bought season two as soon as I was done with season 1.

1933633867|1.0|All the praise and 5 star reviews propelled me through about 30% of this book.  At that point I am giving up, mired in the incoherent and bizarre trajectory the author follows.  My interest in this book was sparked by the promise of it being a thought provoking work that could expand my understanding of the nature of debt, and possibly put some of the current economic events in some sort of interesting context.  Alas, it seems the debt i entered into in buying this book is unfulfilled.
0345803485|3.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is a piece based off of the Twilight characters. The siliartities between this novels characters and Twilights main characters lie largely in the descriptions, status and attributes of the Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. Christian is beautiful, rich, powerful, and mysterious, with a secret to hide. Ana is clumsy, insecure, stubborn, and uncontrollably drawn to Christian. Sound familiar?<br /><br />Don't expect any paranormal Fun with this book. The vampires vs. wolves plot line has been replaced with Dominant/Submissive plot line. Christian Grey draws Ana into his world of Dominant sexual escapades, while Ana reluctantly tries on the submissive role with her \\"inner goddess\\" cheering her on along the way. She is taken from naive virgin to submissive in training through the course of the book.<br /><br />I haven't really read erotica, but the intimate encounters in the book are graphic, in a juvenile way.  The descriptions of activities Come across as if they were written by a teenager. Juvenile descriptions of acts and body parts create steamy, awkward reading. This could be a device the author is using to express Ana's naieveity, but if that is the intent, it is not clear.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey isn't a challenging read. It's fluff with a little naughty sauce. If you prefer meaty reads, fifty shades is going to fall flat. If you're looking for a diversion, fifty shades should fit the bill nicely.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My daughter and I absolutely love this game! It's very engaging and keeps my daughter coming back. Good job! We look for more games by Gameloft.
1591844096|5.0|\\"linchpin\\" is an important reminder that work done well is the only work worth doing. Seth honors not only artists, but all types of workers who breathe artistry into their vocation and make themselves indespensable. If you're looking for a step-by-step for success this isn't the book, and that's the point. Value comes from the artistry, the things difficult to explain in a worker.
B005FISC52|5.0|This was by far the best season of One Tree Hill. It was dramatic, touching, hilarious, and the acting was nearly perfect.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|It's a great game. Very fun, very addictive, and nice for people who want something both social and with a creative outlet.
0312965788|5.0|I read this book many years ago and becane an instant fan of James Herriott. He had me laughing out loud at some of the antics. I have since then have read all his books. If you have never read All Creatures Great and Small do it. You will not be sorry. This is just one book I bought at Amazon.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|it was an ok game it could have been better. but overall I had a lot of fun playing it
B0034G4P94|5.0|I'm not going to go over the same ground all the other reviewers did, just say that if you can hear everything that's said the first time through, good for you. If, like me, half of it was illegible, you'll miss a lot of the things that make the plot work and hint that characters have made progress. The performances are spectacular to a man so the acting strength made me rewatch it and this time I turned on the subtitles and caught a lot more. Just a suggestion: it's definitely underwritten, and the characters stay somewhat stock but the acting blows it all away anyway. Karate Kid for adults, with a serious family drama interwoven. Somehow this odd chemistry works.<br />One more thing that really bothers me about nearly every review and plot description I've seen. This is NOT the Tom Hardy Show. Yes, he's brilliant. But it's Joel Edgerton's movie. His character is the lead, the main focus and the only sympathetic person in the thing. His story is the main storyline and the tale that holds the entire show together so don't go in thinking it's all about Hardy. It's not. Edgerton's Brandon is the focus and the follow-through and the heart. Hardy is the broken-to-the-point-of-psychotic mess he plays so well.<br />Speaking of which, I wish someone would let him play something without blood on his teeth....<br />Update: just have to add that this has turned out to be my favorite film of that year. I find I rewatch it all the time and it's never boring, never dull. It's melodramatic and very unsubtle, so this is a bit of a surprise to me but I think it's fabulous.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|ok I guess. simple little timewasters and a lot of variety. how many more words do I need? this should do it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't write many reviews, but when I read something really bad that makes we wish I hadn't spent the money on it, I want others to know about it.  I always read the reviews, but the reviews on this book, I don't get.  I don't understand all the hype this book is getting. I did finish it, but now I'm not sure why.  The story line is so weak, the writing is very average, the characters are so unreal.  Maybe it's the sex scenes that are getting everyone's attention, but they too getting boring after a while since the same dialog and scenes seem to keep repeating themselves.  Plus the book ends right in the middle of a scene - such a set up for book 2, that frustrates me!  Seriously, save your money.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game ! when I saw it I though it would cost money but this game is free! ROCK ON 101-IN-1 GAMES! I give this game 5 stars
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so so so addicting you cant just play one time. You just keep wanting to get the next game and the next
B0030DD9I4|2.0|I have been a pretty loyal Eminem fan since the days of \\"My Name Is\\". This is with my tastes changing and Hip-Hop as a whole leaving my listening repertoire almost completely. For quite a while I felt I could see eye to eye with Eminem.<br /><br />Not here.<br /><br />On this album he took the horrible half-Jamaican/half-Triumph the Insult Comic Dog accent and ran it through the majority of the tracks. If you can get over that, try getting over the fact that it sounds like it was mixed in someone's basement. Huge step backwards... Relapse is right.<br /><br />Personally, I wish Amazon sold time machines so I could go back in time and punch myself in the mouth for thinking about buying this in the first place.<br /><br />If you're missing this album from your Eminem discography - skip it.<br /><br />**In before the super hardcore Eminem fans attempt to verbally poop on me for this review... Consider the fact that he trashes this album himself in his next release, multiple times.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|way better than tap zoo and cheaper to Evan with your favorite ice age characters and more this game is way better than tap zoo tap zoo should be replaced by this
B005IF7TCE|4.0|I can say from the last three days of gaming from COD to RE this headset does it all. The fact that gunfire and other noise does not affect communication is amazing, would not use any other except for Turtle Beach. Now one drawback is you get no back ground sounds so anyone sneaking up on you is a disadvantage to this mic set. Over all this mic is boss its light and comfortable and has no wires to worry about so convenience is A+. I would recommend for gamers who love the free style headsets and love combat style communications to help the team win the game.
B006WPSQVC|5.0|Wonderful message for all fathers.  This movie was shown at our church, and it was a real inspiration to many fathers in our community.  I want to watch it again.
0345803485|3.0|I found myself skipping the boring, repetitive sex scenes to get back to the story line.  I never before heard a woman refer to her privates as \\"my sex\\" and can't you come up with some better or hotter than \\"down there?\\"  If Ana bit her lip one more time, or if I had to hear about how whatever pants Christian was wearing hung just so on his hips. I was hoping the inner goddess would fall off the face of the earth!!!  I'm reading the 2nd book because I'm curious to see where the relationship goes, and what is behind all of Christian's weird issues, but it's just more of the same boring, repetitive stuff as far as the sex goes. I think the author just copied and pasted the same thing over and over and changed a word or two here and there.
B00097E4A6|4.0|Was very pleased with this product although it appears to be very over-priced in the U.S., but the oversees vendor Protronic was really wonderful!! My granddaughter just loves it and it really adds to the length of the train.  Directions on how to fit it in the regular train track would really be helpful.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|even the it freeze its pretty cool i realy like th concept of this game it allows u to fight on the frontlines with ur army
B006TTC590|5.0|How can I say this simply. If you haven't seen this movie, or don't like this movie, your not a good American.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|i'm 45. i read all the twilight books. i consider books like these the twinkies of literature. all fluff and goo. fun to read, easy to forget, may give you a headache. yeah, it's fan lit, not well written but it takes all of 2 days to read three books, and-like twilight-i will probably read them again.  meh....couple of complaints-i just hope that no woman thinks they are seriously going to have a bajillion orgasms in 10 seconds flat, seriously? no woman i know can. lucky ana. also, what's with christian being able to get it up every 60 seconds? for being so damaged.<br />oh well, i still admit to reading the books. still had fun doing it, dumb as they are.
0545265355|5.0|A great set at a great price. This is a new set, in perfect condition. We have already started reading this set.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|so i cant even get on it. i press it then my screen goes black then it brings me back to my home screeen grrrrrrre
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Takes brains to play it, and I fail. The graphics are great though.  I hope you realize that this is with a sence of humor.  Now seriously great game to pass some time in the Dr.s office. or on a long trip.<br />  Stuff
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game rocks :) I love it so funny to pass the time lol :) :) :):) I think everyone should give this game 5stars its awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004ZJZQCE|4.0|I've never understood why The Jackal has been cursed with poor reviews from pretty much everybody. From the day I saw it as a 17-year-old in January 1998 I always found it entertaining and exciting. This might be down to the fact that I have never seen the 1973 original.<br /><br />Brucie plays a nameless assassin, cool as ice and utterly emotionless. Richard Gere is the only man to have seen him. He's let out of prison to assist the FBI in catching the Jackal before he takes out an uncertain high-ranking official. Willis and Gere are, for the most part, leading their own movies as they never meet until the climax. It's very interesting watching them both go about their business, Willis hatching a master plan and Gere methodically picking apart his trail and hunting him down. There is great support from Sidney Poitier and cutie-pie Diane Venora as a scarred Russian cop.<br /><br />With a wide variety of brilliantly photographed locations across the US and Canada, and plot with a medium-level of complexity it's not entirely brainless viewing but not too taxing as to alienate lazy viewers. I honestly do not get why so many people hate it. Willis has done far worse films (even seen Mercury Rising?) that get off scot-free somehow, but The Jackal doesn't get off so lightly. Aside from Gere's slightly dodgy Oirish accent I have no complaints about this film. Give it a chance and you might just be entertained.<br /><br />The Blu Ray features a nice-looking 2.40:1 1080p picture with DTS HD-MA sound. None of the extras from the DVD have been ported over.
B007H7XJD4|1.0|This movie really sucked. With such a cool title like \\"Immortals\\", how could the movie be bad?<br /><br />Well, for starters, the movie borrowed the names of Greek legends like Zeus, Athena, Theseus, Poseidon, but lost most (if not all) of the traditional Greek mythology that goes with the names. Namely, the movie makers took these famous names and made up their own stories completely, trying to give the movie modern appeal. What came out was a movie that kind of made sense but didn't have much meaning or depth. The battle scenes weren't interesting or intense. The story didn't draw me in. I felt no emotional connection/sympathy/empathy with the characters. Overall, it was a disappointment and predictably boring. The ending was a little confusing.<br /><br />While I was able to sit through and watch the whole movie, it was really lacking. I thought because it was made by the producers of 300 that the movie would have some interesting points...but overall it was a drag. I say, skip!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This app is right on the money for what I've been hearing about it. I also agree that we should have temple run and jetpack joyride for the kindle fire and in the amazon app store. Just sayin.
B005VQRPME|5.0|I've heard this recording on various CD formats, including the recent SHM-CD version. This edition, mastered by APO, is by far the best, and regardless of whether you listen to the SACD or CD layer. The bass is ridiculously resonant; warm but tight. Getz's horn sounds more natural than ever, and this recording has always sounded good. The voices are also right there, lively, but again, completely natural. If securing the best sound quality is a concern, this is hands down the toughest kid on the block. If you don't know the record, it's completely captivating and easily an essential recording. It's not *Kind of Blue,* *Love Supreme,* or \\"Ah Hum,* but I wouldn't take seriously any \\"top 25\\" that omitted it.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It is so fun to play. Catching Scrat is so cute. I don't like having to pay for some of the things.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Enjoyable read about trust and relationships for adults and make no mistake, there is strong adult content here. There are in life, some who are so damaged that they simply lack that abiltiy to trust enough to let go. This book is a journey about letting go. Read the first chapter and decide for yourself. Dont let the popular chatter guide you. Make your own decision. I'm glad I did. Oh, and for the worry worts that think this book will guide them into a life of secrets and darkness? Its a good job we dont let fantasy guide reality or I'd be hiking thru the Shire with Gandalf right now, or trying to figure out how to get out of the rabbit hole...
B007C7UZIG|5.0|I love the idea for steam on kindle fire but make all games in steam compatiable with kindle fire then it would be a amazing App.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|fun game. reminds me of my childhood....glad I found this game, I'll be able to use it for some down time
B007SYWFRM|5.0|ice age review... fantastic graphics.. smooth action.. for kids I guess but cute to play anyway... I enjoyed playing it....kid at heart!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|love this game- have not had any problems with it! its way fun, and I like how you don't have to have friends- you can just play with a random person.<br />the adds aren't too bad, all you have to do is go back. I would have gladly paid maybe $.99 to $1.99 for THIS version.<br />5 stars because it was free, and an excellent game!!! would totally recommend it!! :)
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I can play games with my family and friends this game is the best game I ever played lots of people play this game
159562015X|1.0|I did the test, I was quite surprised how much it was accurate. The sad part, it dose not give your much in term of what job you should do according to your score. They tell: pick something that look like this in that. Kinda blurry. Maybe there is more to it, but it's not a carrear guide book, from what I have read on the website after the test.<br /><br />The website take back what is in the book.<br /><br />It's just a way to make you pay for gathering your information into a giant database called gallup. Just rent it at your public library, read all the descriptions, find the 5 that look like you and you will have save money buying that book.
0321344758|5.0|This book is a classic and still relevant and thought-provoking after seven years--which is saying a lot since, after all, we're talking about the web. Krug offers a collection of simple yet powerful guidelines that sound deceptively easy but actually require a lot of thought. You may find your teams saying \\"We do this already!\\", but it's worth it to sit down and actually explore what's going on with your webpage or web app. I'll be returning to it regularly to regain a fresh perspective on web usability.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Conventional wisdom claims that omniscient narration creates a detachment to the characters, and I never agreed with that assessment. This book is one example why. Liesel, the book thief, is a great character and her interactions with her friend Rudy, her father and Max--the Jewish man they hide in their basement, all lead to a lot of emotional scenes that won't disappoint. While the characters may seem stereotypical--it's hard not to considering the setting--I found the Author's unique voice passionate. It's obvious he put his heart into this story.<br /><br />I would've given this book five stars if it weren't for all the short abrupt chapter endings and seemingly endless use of \\"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.\\" The third act seemed a little weighed down with narrative that pulled me away from Liesel and her relationships, but once the story got back on track, it stayed there. I'm planning on having my daughters read this book. There are great opportunities for philosophical discussions about the morality of war and how the most innocent among us are affected. It's something we usually don't think about.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is the most fun game I have played. it keeps me busy and occupied and never get bored with it
B007V2UGPE|4.0|must download its catchy and fun. could play for hours well so far its only begun we 'll see how it goes
B0041B785Y|2.0|The vocals for this album are honestly the worst I've heard from Meshuggah, and it's a huge step in the wrong direction. I couldn't even listen to the entire album because it was so awful. Slow rhythms and strained vocals are not Meshuggah's style, and that's exactly what this album is.<br /><br />Obzen, Nothing, and Contradictions Collapse still get my votes for their best work.
0807262013|4.0|The Amber Spyglass is the final book of the trilogy wrtiten by Philip Pullman. I experienced the first book, \\"The Golden Compass\\" as a video viewing. Compelling was it that I chose the complete the trilogy thru audio book. Each chapter of book 3 is preface with poetry that reveals the writers knowledge of biblical truths and vastly diversed types of writings. This third book spiraled too far out in it's imagination of the battle between GOOD and evil. Tying all the loose ends together at the end was disappointing, however, he managed to bring a few eyebrow raising suprises. I wish he would eliminated some details of little significance and had put more emphasis and detailing in the parting of the two main characters that ended the story. Depending of ones personal beliefs, readers are left having to decide for themself which side won this battle.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|Keeps me up to date on everything.  Love it. gives you a options of what you want to read. and live feeds as well.
B001HN6918|5.0|This is a remarkable story. There is an enormous amount of positive character building messages built in the story line that are good for children. Parents are enouraged to view this movie with their child to bring out the sound messages contained within that a child can overlook. It displays honor, respect,true friendship, team work, the love of a step father, and the admiration of a son responding to being raised with love. The bestest #2 of a series I have seen.  Highly recommended
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The good folks at LifeChurch.Tv have provided an amazing tool to help anyone get into the Bible. With dozens of different versions and plans to choose from, anyone wanting to grow in faith in the Word will be deeply satisfied.

B006R1T40I|5.0|I first heard Bonnie's version of \\"Right Down the Line\\" on the radio. The great Gerry Rafferty song, is featured here with an infectious, insistent reggae feel. It's the best thing I've heard for a while. I hoped the rest of Slipstream would be as infectious and it is --  but in different ways.<br />Introspective, reflective and so Bonnie-Raitt-musical that old fans of this American treasure will savor it all. Welcome back!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app is fun. I like how you can play games and then get points then with the points you earn you can get new minigames!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Seriously.  I read it for free (Kindle w/Prime) and actually bought it afterwards. I couldn't stand not giving something back to an author who gave me so much pleasure, and I'm a cheapskate lacking any sort of conscience.<br /><br />FYI, if you have one of those J-O-B things, you should probably start reading it on a Friday so you won't have to choose between Wool and gainful employment.
0143121006|5.0|The story of Pamela, the murder victim, is one of the most poignant stories I have ever read.  The author's narrative is clear and flows with a freshness that makes a story from 1937 become as vivid as if I were reading it in today's paper.  The narrative couples the mystery of a young girl's brutal murder with the depiction of the intersections of European and Asian communities on the eve of WW2, awaiting a destruction as brutal on a large scale as the murder of Pamela is as an individual.<br />I found myself saddened, moved, fascinated, angry but above all involved in this cruel story in brilliant narration.

B00004WIDR|4.0|There are always new generations who have never seen a particular film from the past. For those in that category, I give it a four rating. It does have good dinosaurs, a few thrilling moments, Good Guys and Bad Guys, menacing creatures who do mean things, and menacing creatures who are only so because some dumb vicious human beings want to invade their space. There is a child to identify with and, I suppose, there may be one or two adults who may be appealing. For me, aside from the child, who is not supposed to know danger, only the Jeff Goldblum character had any common sense (or uncommon common sense, I guess it is). The rest were all pretty much asking for trouble which they could not handle. I would advise against projecting into the film any moral dilemmas or concepts of a decent environment for the Earth. The intention here was simply to cash in on the success of the first film in what turned out to be a three-film series.<br />So, for those who are new to this particular trilogy of the mega-successful Spielberg, I would certainly recommend the DVD as a good way to spend a couple of hours.<br />For those who saw Jurassic Park or the film following this, Jurassic Park III, I would commend this one only to real Dinosaur fans and for those film-goers who have a need for completion. There are many of the latter, aside from film historians and critics, who might have to see it due to the demands of their jobs. For them I would only say, it is not in the same league as the original, but is an OK film to see only once.<br />A note on seeing the film a few years after the review was written and only a day after seeing the original Jurassic Park. I wouldn't change most of the remarks: however, I must say I found the film a good deal more entertaining than I did when I wrote the review. There are a sufficient number of action scenes to carry the film despite the inane chatter which make comprise the \\"moral\\" conflict between so-called environmentalists and pseudo-Capitalist pigs. The original two or three Tarzan films did it better.
B005K17RU0|5.0|excellent very acurate. also has things like how good it is for hair friziness and picnics and other stuff like that. luv this app
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I started reading and had a hard time putting out down. Nicholas Sparks has a way of keeping you interested in turning page after page. Another great book by this author.
B007Y360A0|3.0|I love TBBT, but this episode is an anomaly.  It seems like someone else wrote it other than the regular writers -- Sheldon's character especially seems off-kilter.  I know that was part of the point of the episode, but when Sheldon does out-of-character things, it usually is funnier (i.e. his relationship with Amy).  This episode just seemed stilted.  Still can't wait for the wedding episode, though.  Howard and Bernadette are hilarious together.
B004ZZS4CC|1.0|Although i understand this was not written by a professional writer it was hard to get through. Most of the book was repetition

B0067Q04AM|5.0|Every song on 'Black Radio' shines with smooth, jazzy instrumentation, emotive vocals, and catchy-as-$#!%  melodies. The stars here are unquestionably the vocalists who deliver songs by Sade, Nirvana, David Bowie, and Glasper himself with pure, non-AutoTuned SINGING (what a concept). If you like your music to be true and soulful lend Black Radio your ear and groove out!
B007R41E8O|4.0|I had similar problems with download and restarts as other users. The game was worth the money; kept me interested for hours. But a few times I had difficulty picking up items in the searches (goddamn pendant). The ending was a curiosity: I wonder if there were alternate endings because I know that there were certain tasks that I did not complete. I would let anyone interested that there is a lot of extraneous back and forth that can become tedious. But if you're stuck on a flight to New Zeland the game might kill the bulk of the flight.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This game is BEAST because now it got 2 more planets and to more planets = more levels!!! This is game is totally. worth the money! And it is great on kindle fire!!!

B005OP71GC|1.0|No way to overcome the poor acting.  Characters are annoying.  Totally unrealitic depiction of reality, which is far worse. Whatever sells
159102594X|4.0|Overview:<br />---------<br />I picked up this book at the recommendation of my local bookstore.  Otherwise, I would not have heard of Joe Abercrombie at all.<br /><br />The book is the story of several main characters from very different walks of life that all get pulled into a quest.  The quest is not really defined at all in the book other than one of the key character (very powerful) says that the quest must be done immediately.  The main characters, Logen Ninefingers, Sand Dan Glokta, Alee West, Major West (brother of Alee) and Bayez (elder mage and founder of one of the major countries) are very different.  Logen Ninefingers is a \\"Named Man\\" from the Northmen -- aka have to be a serious badass to earn a name.  He is tired of killing and being attacked; he just wants some peace but violence has a way of following him.  His special skill is staying alive...if you make him go to the unhappy place, you are not long for the world.  Sand Dan Glokta is a fencing master who was captured and extensively tortured for a long period of time.  Since his return home, he has become a master inquisitor (think Spanish Inquisition without the soft pillows).  He is a horrible, broken and morally backrupt person who still has a strange fascination with the truth.  Bayez is a very power mage;  Mages are very rare in the world.  Magic is slowly dying off in the world but Bayez can really bring it down when he wants to.  He is a bit of an elder statesman, a cowboy and a teller of truths.  The character development is fairly good in the book.  It makes you want to read more about the characters to see what happens to the characters.<br /><br />The writing style is effective and compact.  The author does a good job of detailed descriptions were it makes senses and cuts to the chase in other areas.  The writing style is adjust depending on which character(s) are involved at that point of the story.  The change in tone and style helps build out the world and the characters.<br /><br />The Mileu of the story is an alternate Europe before gunpowder became widely used.  Their is magic in world but very few can use it, let alone believe in it.<br /><br />The book is not \\"page turner\\" but rather something you read in sections.  I did find that sections with specific characters were more interesting than others. So, your reading experience will probably be similar but for your favority characters.<br /><br />I was a bit frustrated with lack of a description of what the big quest was actually for.  You just know that something needs to be done...well it does not really come up until near the end of the story.  So, the story arcs seem to wander a bit until the characters start to get near to each other and interact.<br /><br />So, if you are looking for a new author but not high fantasy, then you should give this book a try.
0345803485|5.0|I have to say I was curious when I bought the first book.  I had been reading a lot of reviews and finally I took a look inside and bought the Kindle edition.  That was five days ago, and I have now read the entire trilogy twice in that time! When I wasn't working or sleeping (I kept Christian hours), I was reading.  The plot, language, musical references, and erotica were masterfully woven together.  She has created and thirst for her next book, series, or what have you that won't be exstiguished easily.  I am not into spoilers so this is all I have to say-if you like to have a story the carries you from page to page and through each characters emotion and development you will not be disappointed by this triology.  Seriously, by the whole collection because once you finish the first you'll be clamouring for the next! Ms. James you are amazingly talented, and I look forward to the next!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|love this game.and you cant beat the free price. i love playing it.you can cook and come back at a later time.or cook something in five mins.wish i had friends to play this with though.
B005POK858|3.0|By that I mean the sprites and graphics and whole game possibly appear to have been created in RPG Maker PC with some additional scripting.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|Fun game that gives you something to do. Its an ok sidescrolling game that has potential but gets old Kinda fast.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|If I could give this no stars I would.  Been playing this game for a few weeks and it often freezes up my kindle fire and when I get the kindle started again everything goes to some outrageous amount of time.  Gameloft is unresponsive about this issue and frankly I'm sick to death of starting over and losing all my progress.  I'm uninstalling this game and would advise others not to even bother getting it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I think this app is great! This would be good for the student in school that's on the go, like me! If you're wondering if you should get this app, get it! Its great and you won't regret it!

B000WQWPKA|4.0|A massive alien spacecraft has fallen into orbit around the earth and communications channels are disrupted around the globe. David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) who is a communications expert sees a hidden transmission in the TV signals overriding the communication satellites. He tries to tell his ex-wife who works for the President of the United States but she blows him off thinking he doesn't really know what is going on. Suddenly dozens of large flying saucer shaped craft the size of a large city drop out of the mother ship and hover over the major cities of the world.<br /><br />Meanwhile Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) is a military pilot on leave and gets up out of bed to see a flying Saucer as large as downtown Los Angeles hovering over the city. He leaves his girlfriend to return to the military base as he is recalled for immediate action and security....<br /><br />What follows is a pretty good Sci-Fi movie with some laughs built in. You have to take some of the movie with a grain of salt as parts are really far stretched but what good Hollywood movie isn't these days. The special effects are pretty good and the story line is not bad if you take out the alcoholic crop duster that can fly an F 18 Hornet with no flight training since the Vietnam War.<br /><br />There is a lot of action, special effects and some decent plot lines within the movie. If you just look at it as 2 hours of entertainment you will enjoy it. It shows mankind rising up in the face of total destruction at the hands of aliens who want our planet. The collection of miscellaneous personalities overcomes a superior force and technology to win the day. It is worth watching and you will have fun enjoying it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this book trilogy is amazing even though im 19 years old i still had plenty fun and suspense reading this book. the author did a great job in writing this book, everything read is so vivid i can picture everything clearly. since i started reading the first book 4 days ago im half way through with the last one. the books are amazing i really cant stop reading, looking forward to what happens next in the book. i recommend this anyone looking to read an interesting book and keep them entertained, probably ages 13+ but really an amazing trilogy cant give enough praise, im not a person to read much but i went through the first 2 books in 3 days. !!SPECTACULAR!!

0812550706|5.0|This has to be, one of the best science fiction books I've read. I didn't want to put it down once I picked it up. Ender's Game is where earth is threatened by a hostile alien species with superior technology that seems determined to destroy the human race. It's an amazing read, It's one of those books that just get's you hooked, that you have to read it straight through without taking a break. I would also like to recommend another great sci-fi fantasy  [[ASIN:1475115849 Savior]]  simply incredible!!!!
0345803485|1.0|I bought this book after learning about it on the \\"Today\\" show.  The dominance/submission descriptions are arousing enough, I suppose, but I've read hotter erotica, and the plot is extremely preposterous: an unbelievably gorgeous and wealthy young male business executive falling somewhat helplessly for an awkward and completely innocent (or ignorant?) twenty-two year old girl...  What bothered me most, though, in reading the book, besides its having been written in the present tense when I prefer my fiction written in past tense, is that Anastasia is forever \\"peeking up\\" or \\"blinking up\\" at Christian; she is always \\"flushing\\"; they \\"smirk\\" with great frequency; the narration tends to become cliche.  The over-use of the those preceding terms distracts me from becoming totally involved with or engrossed in the story. The author is English while her characters live in the Seattle/Portland area; annoyingly, they are always saying, \\"Laters\\", when parting which term I've never heard Americans use.  Impulsively, I purchased the trilogy without first reading \\"Fifty Shades...\\", and now can not bear to read the sequels.  The author has become a zillionaire thanks to fools like me!
0345479092|4.0|As you read this book you may think to yourself \\"that totally makes sense!\\" Nothing in this book is rocket science but it is crucial to read as it's basically things you should be thinking and the way you should approach caring for a baby - but it is so simple and common sense that many people may overlook these points.<br /><br />In all, it's a great reminder that everyone struggles at first, but that caring for a small child can be a very positive experience. You are reminded to not get overwhelmed and that every parent struggles with these issues especially in the beginning. I thought it was very helpful and would recommend to anyone expecting a child.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|We were very happy using the cover until we noticed that the plastic casing on one of the corners was starting to peel and that there was a tear in the solid plastic cover on the same corner (after only @ 4 months of use).<br /><br />Marware's Customer Service Dept. was very helpful and they have offered to replace the cover for free, since it comes with a lifetime guarantee, and even to ship it overseas to me!  It is in the mail, and we are very happy with their help and quick response!<br /><br />I'm changing my rating to 4 stars overall because we had been happy with it until we noticed the tear and the peeling.  I assume this was just a fluke and look forward to using the new cover.
B0015XHP4K|2.0|The low rating isn't for the fun of these movies which, other than Sly's hairstyle, hold up well.  It isn't because of the interesting extras that are more than a 'making of' film but an exploration as to how the  movies were developed and came about with insights into the actor's motivations.  It is because, at least for the first two films, the blu ray transfers are barely passable as blu ray.  In First Blood, the contrast and resolution are very soft and details are left as mush.  The audio, especially important to me, makes so little use of the surrounds and subwoofer as to be almost laughable.<br /><br />In the 2nd film, First Blood Part 11, the video transfer was better than the first, but, again, very little  use of any of the surrounds, especially the rear channels.  Both of these movies should have made ample use of the entire sound stage and who ever was responsible for this audio transfer probably took it directly off a Standard audio track and transcoded it to the higher audio compression scheme without working on the audio's master track.  While there is some use of the front left and right channels, it is very little.  My sub actually turned off at one point as there was so little low frequency info being passed.  In the second film, in an early scene when Rambo is in the jet taking off, the jet comes to the viewer and passes overhead.  You'd think that the rear channels would have been used....Nope.<br /><br />Rambo 111, the last in this set does show a marked improvement in quality over the first two films.  Set in Afghanistan, Rambo continues to do his thing, fly helicopters, ignore painful wounds and save his friend and the world.  The important thing here is a considerably crisper video transfer and the DTSHD audio actually does make use of your home theater's entire speaker system.  Good use of all discreet channels and sub, FINALLY.  The video transfer is marked by very good contrast and details in the shadow areas.  This is clearly the best transfer of the 3 films.  The lone extra is more of a half hour documentary on Afghanistan and what the culture was like previously.  This, was how America abandoned it once the USSR left with their tails between their legs allowing  the Taliban came to power.  There are no deleted scenes, outtakes, making of or any other extras.<br /><br /> I had all of these on Standard Def DVDs and hoped for a rousing infusion of visual and audio detail from the Blu Ray versions.  This collection is my first major mistake in converting my DVDs to Blu Ray.  Not worth it at any price.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksnsfer of the 3 films.

B006VA4NJC|5.0|I love this series.  Set in World War I era England, Downton Abbey Chronicles the lives of The Earl and Lady of Grantham, their family and household staff.  Unlike Upstairs/Downstairs which took a more comedic look at manor life, Downton Abbey takes a more serious look at manor life during a time when the world is going through a major growth spurt.  The series began with news of the sinking of Titanic and goes on to show how the household is affected by the war, the introduction and growing popularity of the automobile, and the telephone along with the personal changes, losses, hopes, dreams and foibles of all members of the household.<br /><br />Like any truly great program, Downton shows the characters as true human beings.  No one is perfect.  Some characters are more protagonistic, some are antagonistic, but all are a little bit of both.  Like real people, none of the characters is perfect.  Every one has his or her flaws and weaknesses...a little good and bad in everyone.<br /><br />I love the fact that the manor seems as much a character as any of the people living in it.  In fact, the Earl of Grantham acknowledges that he does not own the house but is merely its custodian.  Just as the characters adapt to the circumstances they find themselves in, so must the house adapt.  It is put to use as a rehabilitation center for officers recovering from injuries sustained in the war while still being used as a residence by the Earl, his family and staff.<br /><br />The show is beautifully filmed and the picture quality on Amazon was wonderful.  The HD quality was crystal clear.  I highly recommend this program.
B003EYVXV4|5.0|I loved this movie. I went and saw it in the theaters two times in a row!  It is almost exactly like the book. There were even parts when the characters said sentences that were straight from the book. I know there are some of you out there who will disagree with me, but when the tributes were in the arena it wasn't extremely gruesome. There was some blood and you did see characters die, but the cameras never lingered on the dead tribute for more than a few seconds. There were two parts that were a little hard to watch. Like when Glimmer is killed by the wasps and when the muttons attacked Katniss, Peeta, and Cato. Really it is more intense than anything. Spoiler... Cato falls down to the mutts and they do attack and swam him but all you see is his eyes and then Katniss shoots him.<br />The actors were really good. The young girl who played Primrose was able to get such fear in her voice and sadness in her voice when Katniss volunteered for her, that it was really hard not to cry. And Rue. Perfectly casted. She made you realize that she was only twelve but life that the capital gave her and the game that she was made her grow up too quickly.<br />This movie was so good. If you read and like the books you will definitely like this movie. It was that good and that close to the book. I don't think that it is a good movie for kids under 13. They would probably get scared and the content of the story line is not appropriate, kids fighting and killing other kids. Not good mind set for kids under 13. But if you are over 13, I think you will love it.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|I liked this book better than the first book in the series. Moved at a good pace and really built on the relationships between the characters and the politics of the 1st book.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|I really looked forward to seeing this on Blu Ray and love the excellent video transfers and multiple versions of the film.<br />The audio is good to excellent with ample use of the home theater's surrounds and great detail in the low frequencies.<br /><br />The video transfer is crisp and clean, very detailed.  The entire film holds up just fine with the years and this film, like Aliens to its predecessor, Alien, actually raised the bar to a higher standard.  If I have any complaint it would be the ultra slow loading of the various extras,  you need patience with this disc, but your patience is rewarded in the end.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Can't put it down!  Written so well it envelopes you as if you are there in every scene.  It's riveting, happy, sad, terrifying all in one.
0316066524|4.0|My take: there are actually three novels here. One is an absolutely wonderful, conventionally realistic take on AA/rehab culture - surely the best work of fiction ever written about the subject. There's also a cleverly conceived and original, but more or less plotless futuristic dystopia, and an occasionally moving but ultimately rather hysterical family romance. By squeezing all three quite different novels between the same pair of covers Wallace made something that's a brilliant work of genius, but only in the same way that Frankenstein's monster was a brilliant work of genius - dropping slippery little pieces of itself all over the laboratory floor as it lurched up off its slab.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy keep you inmerse in the story since the beginning,very emotional,heartbreaking but love is the winner after all.Highly recommended.

B001JRB16U|5.0|This movie is a classic.  I grew up watching it as a child and I love it as an adult.  Perfect for all ages!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This game was fun until it began setting the collection times to unreasonable amounts (for collecting crops and money from businesses).  It happened once and I uninstalled the game and reinstalled it only to have it happen again.  Other than that it was a fun time-management type game.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|um one person was complaining that u have to make an account or link to fb.. why do you have a Kindle Fire but not a fb account just seems that since you're updated on technology that you'd also have what every person possible has, a fb. I love this game!
B006ON41FC|1.0|Could be a fun game, but once I saw it connect to OpenFeint, I uninstalled. Glad I got the app free.
B00634GHJA|5.0|I use it on a Samsung Stratosphere. I like not having to hunt down my cable and connect phone & PC. Not sure what the objection to being at your computer is... I have to plug into the PC or type an address into the browser. Either way I am at the PC. And the address I am provided whereas I have to recall what I did with the USB cable.<br /><br />I have used it 4 times at least. I got the same IP address to enter each time. If I had not, I suspect it would have only been a minor tweak to the stored IP address.<br /><br />It transfers pics just fine. I can't recall using it from PC to phone as yet.<br /><br />(Full Disclosure: I did get it as a free app which may color my opinion).
B002ZIAC4O|3.0|I hadn't listened to much four tet before this album. As an introduction, I would consider listening to some of the other albums, but a bit hesitant to purchase blindly.
0307949508|2.0|*sigh* So I know the rest of the world is simply beside itself with fanfare and glee over this series of books. Heck, that's what made me buckle and buy them. The 1st book was decent enough, if a bit overlong and in desperate need of an editor. Entering into the 2nd book, my hopes were that I'd at least get much of the same....Well, that didn't really happen.<br /><br />MINOR SPOILERS<br /><br />THE GOOD<br />1) The main mystery is interesting enough, with a pulpish, over-complicated story. There's numerous aspects to the mystery, and the book does a decent enough job of being cagey and revealing at the same time. There are times it gets a little too twist heavy, especially near the end, but all-in-all I found the main story very enjoyable (once we actually got to it)<br />2) The main characters maintain a certain amount of interest and manage to (sorta) propel the story along. As long as they're not out getting coffee,or shopping for lunch, tey do tend to get to the point of the matter.<br />3) The action sequences are pretty tightly written, with far less waste than the rest of the book (More on that). They have a nice amount of description and flow that allows you to kind of visualize how it's all going down. In fact, they're quite possibly the most enjoyable moments in the book.<br /><br />THE BAD<br />1) This book absolutely screams for an aggressive editor with industrial hedge sheers. At least 200 pages of this book are entirely unnecessary. I'd go so far as to say this is a 150-200 page story bloated up as much as possible. The first 50 pages on their own could easily have been boiled down into 10-20, or cut entirely. So much of the book doesn't add anything to the characters, story, plot, or feel. Did I really need an entire chapter devoted to a character's trip to IKEA, in full detail, including every single item the character looked at, what they thought, and how it looked in the apartment? Did I really need multiple chapters about a characters' jaunt about the city & having coffee? Did I really need multiple chapters about a character's Caribbean vacation, which adds absolutely nothing to the plot or characters? Do I really need to know the exact brands, specifications, and cost of every single appliance, computer, coffee machine, and car within the universe? This is not story or character development, this is just wasting time and space. It's almost likely the author is trying to bore the reader to death so that the action sequences pop more. Mission accomplished, I suppose.<br /><br />2) The book takes great pleasure in presenting endless fake-out Chekhov's Gun moments. Constantly will something be referenced or detailed endlessly, and you figure it must be something that will be deeply relevant later, only to have it never come up again.<br /><br />3) There are so many, what I can best describe as, Cameo Characters. Seriously, one character exists for no other reason than to set up how tough another character is. Another character exists for no other reason than to have a character need rescuing later, then fall into obscurity. At least 2 of the detectives serve no other purpose than to pop up with a whiny remark, then disappear. The seeming parade of these one-off characters just continues on and on.<br /><br />4) Deus Ex Machina as far as the eye can see. Every single time a character is in danger, or something bad is about to happen, or an event is about to go down, you can bet that some random incident, fact, item, or character will swoop in to remedy the situation. At times it's passable. Other times I basically had my jaw hang open in shock at the sheer gall of the Deus Ex Machina. It removes the teeth and danger out of almost every single scene.<br /><br />I really really wanted t like this book more, but there's something terribly wrong when I'm 40% through a book (Thanks kindle!) and only just beginning to get interested. It's even worse that it took till 75% in before I was really interested. That is dreadfully slopping editing and pacing. If you do decide to go ahead with this book, be prepared for a slog.readfully slopping editing and pacing. If you do decide to go ahead with this book, be prepared for a slog.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The good:<br />The story-line was suspensful, entertaining, with twists and turns, and made for a very fast read. It touched on some relevant and interesting subjects, such as the generation gap between parents and children, how so out of touch adults are in their kids world and vice-versa, how much belief we put in the justice system when really, it is as predictable and reliable as the people running it. The \\"murder gene\\" element (i.e., if someones genes can predetermine his/her capability of acting out violently in life) to me was actually not that interesting but it did thicken the plot. The story-line was engaging and I had a very enjoyable reading experience as soon as I realized that this is as deep as it gets.<br />The bad:<br />This is as deep as it gets. Neither the storyline nor the characters are in any way profound or deep, there are multiple plot-holes that werent clarified or if they were, they were explained away in an unreliable manner. All the kids in the book talked and acted the same, so did the adults, and you had the regular good DA/bad DA, sensative and emotional wife/not-in-touch-with-his-feelings-and-in-denial father, and other dichotomies that keep the plot at surface. That said, I must admit that I still manged to enjoy the book - but you do have to know what you're getting yourself into and not expect anything too profound from this novel.<br />The Ugly:<br />While it is an enjoyable read, I am pretty sure I will forget about this book in a week. It didnt leave any lasting impression on me or qualifies as a book that I will come back to or want to reread. It's okay to take out from the library or to borrow from a friend for a fun vacation read or for passing the time, but I wouldn't recommend spending your hard earned money for it.

B00005N6KG|5.0|My oldest son is disabled and not very coordinated. He loves his MP3 player and we keep 2 or 3 on hand because he's prone to dropping things, losing the MP3 player in the recliner or slamming it in the door. The same with his headphones. These headphones are very comfortable, good quality and excellent value for the price. We keep several of these on hand, too, because they are even more likely to be slammed or caught on a doorknob. He cannot tolerate ear buds or ear-covering headphones so these are just perfect. I use them, too, if I can't find my iPod earphones because the other kids are always 'borrowing' them. It's just that they don't always come back to me. I find them very comfortable and they seem weightless.<br /><br />One question for Amazon, though: Why can I order only three sets at a time? What's the rationale behind limiting the number we can order? In the past, I was able to order 5 at a time and I never asked for more than that per order. I'm just a little confused.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I absolutely loved this book..I was a little nervous about it, given a lot of the bad reviews, but I took a chance based on the good reviews...I'm so glad I did...Yes, the characters (especially Travis) have some issues and YES he is very volatile..However, having said that, It didn't bother me, and I found myself realy rooting for him. I read the book in about a day....It says Young adult..I disagree...The only thing young about it is that it takes place in college.....I recommend it this book to my over 35 yr old fellow readers..
B007X15GRQ|3.0|This movie wasn't much for drama and cinematography, but it did move right along with action and some suspense, and a couple of great twists! Forgettable, but fun while I was watching it! Better a $1.99 movie!
B003VDZWAQ|4.0|Personally there are 2 ways to view this show.<br /><br />You accept it for what it is, which is an average television show that isnt going to break any boundries and isnt going to come up with a completely original plot BUT it does keep you entertained and in some episodes wanting more.<br /><br />Or you switch it off.<br /><br />We have all learned from shows like LOST, that you can keep the audience in too much of a suspense. Although the premise of the show makes us want to know, were 2 seasons in and i dont feel any better for watching it.<br /><br />Most of the first several episodes are good and this is the reason for the higher rating. As the season grows the show grows tiresome and it isnt until the last episode that i was interested again, only for that to fade ep.3 season 2.<br /><br />I cant fault any of the actors, I just done like the overall pace of the show.<br /><br />However if you can hang in there its worth watching season 1.
B007BVOF8E|1.0|Very disappointing movie!  My husband had seen the original, so he was interested in seeing the new remake.  I found it dull and hard to follow.
B004TI5N38|5.0|This was my first novel by David Baldacci. It will not be my last. A finely woven plot, characters I cared about and explosive action. A good book will keep you turning pages....A great story will transport you into the plot, electrify your senses, and leave you wanting more...This is one of those stories...
B003Q7B78S|4.0|Watching this movie was an enlightening experience, having a great story line, fabulous photography, an extraordinary and stellar cast and a director that knows how to make magic.  Well done!
B005GHN2GG|4.0|4+ stars.  This was an overall very enjoyable read.  Good writing, good characterization, great interaction between the characters and interesting plot.  World building was okay, pretty vague, though there were aspects I particularly liked such as mage-finder hounds.<br /><br />I did find the the first few chapters a bit slow, although the beginning grabs you with the scene of the god Corruption trying to seduce Silhara to accept him.  Despite Silhara being a seclusive, all powerful mage and Martise a bondwoman, I found both characters to be fairly human/normal in their thoughts and actions.  I love the interactions between Silhara and Martise, their relationship progressed gradually and built from admiration of inner strength rather than outward appearance, particularly in the case of Silhara towards Martise.<br /><br />I tend to like one main character over the other, here I liked them both equally.  Silhara doesn't really fit a typical alpha male hero mold, he has a somewhat tortured past, has sorcery powers that is feared but lives as a recluse and a pauper who wants nothing more than to live as an orchard grower.  Unfortunately, Corruption has his eye set on him as his vessel to rule the world and this is a battle Silhara struggles harder with as time goes by.  Martise also does not fit any typical heroine role, hers is a more quiet strength, her defiance in the wrongs against her is rarely verbal but is manifested in her courage and perseverance, this is what draws Silhara to her.  Both of them are admirable in what they each sacrifice for the other to live, the latter parts of the book was very good in the depth of emotion it conveyed that will pull at your heart strings.
0345803485|1.0|WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK - A TAKE OFF ON AN OLD MOVIE 9 1/2 WEEKS ONLY WORSE.  SO DEGRADING TO WOMEN.<br />I REALLY COULD NOT FINISH THIS THREW IT IN THE TRASH - HOW BAD HAVE  NOVELS GOTTEN THAT THIS IS  A BEST SELLER.<br /><br />DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY - I GUESS IF YOU ARE A TEENAGER YOU MIGHT WANT TO READ THIS - ANYONE WITH A BRAIN SHOULD AVOID....
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|When I first got this game (cama) I thought that I was going to delete it right away.  I was wrong!!!  It is a great way to pass time and very fun!  There are only four colors to choose from though..... that's why I am rating it four stars instead of five.
B005KELW26|5.0|This is exactly what i was looking for! The actual product looks a lot better than the picture. Totally recommend this product to anyone with a Kindle Fire! The kindle fits perfectly inside the case. So totally worth my money!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|my mom had an iphone and all I would do before I got my kindle was play this app on her phone! it is so fun and addicting and really great for a free app. now all we need is temple run but really after getting an app like this on the kindle you cant complain.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game!  Its easy to stack up the coins and acorns. The baby animals are so cute!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love angry birds it's amazing!!!! I don't see why anyone wouldn't get this app. I have it on my phone, ipod, and now my kindle fire
140053271X|4.0|I got this as a Christmas present from my parents and when I opened the packaging, my expectations were high.<br /><br />It is light, which is nice when you're laying down and reading or is just nice when carrying it in your bag.<br /><br />Though, the whole flashes-when-you-turn-the-page thing is a bit annoying at first, you get used to it. The store, starting up and loading books and everything else is pretty fast and reliable.<br /><br />The option to either tap the page, use the buttons located on either sides or slide the page are all nice to be able to choose and the page isn't overly touchy or anything.<br /><br />The only thing I had a HUGE problem with - and maybe it's just mine, but - there is a problem when connecting to certain wifi connections and I've read about other people having the same problem. I don't know how to fix it and Customer Service has been little help. So that is really the only problem I have with this.<br /><br />Other than that, if you just want something simple --like the products suggest - you will love this little device. Plus, it's very affordable and made well! :)
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|its finally here! yay! I was so sad when I first discovered the game and they dint have it but they do now and its so much fun! thanks guys!:D
B0055SWM08|4.0|I love the music for this game. It is so peaceful.  The game itself is alright but a little easy.
B000TEPE12|5.0|There's not much to say Lenny is one of the best musician ever<br />With really good music<br />Great album buy it!
B000ZM7VVO|5.0|Being a lover of Irish music and of rock, I am thrilled with Flogging Molly's ability to incorporate both styles into their music.  They are truly an Irish Rock Band, not just a rock band who happens to be from Ireland.  Drunken Lullabies is their best album to date in that every song is worthy and not just filler to make a whole album.  I would recommend it to rock fans and Irish fans equally.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have been waiting to get this app on my kindle!!! I have not had any issues with this game so far. Now if they could get temple run I would be VERY happy.<br />Anyway I&lt;3 this game!!!(draw something)
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun little city Sim. Not really sure what else to say. Hate the word requirements. Lameness. Blar blar blar. Blar.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this is great on the kindle fire works perfectly and doesn't lag... so much fun... great app totalty work the download.
B005HSL626|5.0|you are an awesome person. with one review you have gained my respect for years to come. I wholeheartedly agree with everything (or most everything) you said. thank you.<br />I would like to add that this app is fantastic and it's FREE. if you don't like the ads then don't freaking play the game.
B001PPLIEG|1.0|The editing made this movie terrible to watch...so much it gave me a headache. Perhaps if I blinked in sequence it would not have been so bad. I hope the next Bond movie has less choppy action scenes and more of a story.
0439023491|5.0|I received all three of The Hunger Games books. They were amazing stories. I couldn't put them down. All my grandchildren are reading them too and really like them.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|people gate this game because they cant exit. well guess what just press stuff options and you can go back to your screen. And make sure your child knows that they spend money on buying nuts and coin.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|fun game; but hate the fact that 1 energy every 3 mins...  seriously ..... I'm not paying for energy. needs updated to Allow other ways to get more energy.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|I read a lot about these from fans up on Head-Fi.org and I am glad I ordered a pair.  They sound great for the price
B001N1DPDE|3.0|I had to write a review to counteract all the hype this knife has on Amazon. I've been using a cheap Gerber \\"Big Rock\\" for a couple years with no complaints. It's been used on camping trips, fishing trips, hikes, even in the kitchen I use it. I decided I wanted to upgrade my knife and chose the bk2 after watching some videos and reading some reviews.<br /><br />When it came in the mail today and I finally held it in my hand, I was instantly disappointed. It felt like a hammer! Clunky and top heavy. I didn't really like the handles either, they felt kind of slippery. Also it was so freaking hard to pull the knife out of the sheath. I'm sure it'll get better over time but it takes two hands to do right now. I feel like the knife was designed for a 6 foot 5 body builder.<br /><br />I instantly used it on some wood since I was cutting dead branches down in my yard. Did some batoning, shaving, and some chopping. It could chop and baton very well but didn't cut and slice that good. The blade length is great but its thickness and height is a little too much.  I would never even consider taking this knife on a fishing trip or a short hike because it's just too heavy and clunky. That being said I would consider taking it on a long trip because I feel like it's indestructible.<br /><br />So if you're looking to beat the **** out of your knife or use it like an axe then this is your choice. If you're looking to do some food prep and some delicate camp work along with some batoning then you need to find another knife. I can only suggest a Gerber Big Rock since it's never done me any wrong (The sheath kinda blows though).  I guess I'll see if this knife can prove useful over time but I don't see it happening. The hunt for an upgrade is still on.
B006VA3ZT6|2.0|Episode #2 is really slow. I wish I knew they were for free on PBS. Hopefully the rest of the episodes pick up.<br />Plus Lady Mary Crawley is tiring. Im tired of her character and Matthew for that matter.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|After trying to get me to spend money just to be able to enjoy the game, it glitched and erased all of my progress after several hours of play. I deleted it out of frustration. Granted it was free, but I still expected to get a quality product. I will never download a Gameloft game again.
0439023521|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is hard to believe it would be for young adults as I am much older and still loved it.  The book was quite entertaining and I will definitely be getting the second book in the series.  I probably should have just bought all three at once as they continue the story with the next two.  Very entertaining.
B000062X90|5.0|What a great listening pleasure.The early 70's rocked.The music was alive and actually meant something.What a great cover with the watchman protecting his own.Great music. Great lyrics. Great production.And now released with the super hard to find live 3 song Memphis sessions as bonus tracks. You cant go wrong here.10 songs,great price,and a classic.....support your favorite artists......
B007J4T2G8|4.0|i really dont know how i feel about this book. i dont know if it was good or bad.after hearing all the hype about it and how ppl were comparing it to twilight (which by the way i love the series) i decided to give it a try. after reading the first 3 chapters or so , i was thinking ok so when is he gonna say that he is a vampire? ummmm yeah it never happened! lol. but some of the book reminded me of twilight. like mr grey reminds me of edward with how he is so mysterious how ana is just as clumsy as bella . when Ana found out i was just as shocked as her! all in all it was an ok and long read..to me things just seemed long and drawned out at times..i have read other books that are like this in some form and sad to say that were a little bit better. but i will read the others and hope that they are better than this one which for some reason i think they will be.
0439023513|5.0|(Some spoilers, I suppose. Read at your own risk.)<br /><br />I thought Mockingjay wrapped things up beautifully and, most of all, realistically. This is the book where the most significant themes and ideas behind all three books--trust and community, power and corruption (lots of fun gray area here with the whole classic \\"good and evil\\" thing), morality vs. self-preservation, perception--really come to light and/or are questioned and challenged as we watch Katniss become reluctantly wedged right in the middle of the escalated struggle between the Capitol, District 13, and the rebels.<br /><br />Katniss matured a lot. When I reread the first HG book a couple weeks back, I found I was annoyed with how suspicious and guarded (and to be honest, a little bit thick) she was. I mean, yeah, I get it... she's had to fend for herself since childhood and had to be wary of everyone in a tough world, etc. Still, it was frustrating. So it was nice to see her slowly come to trust others over the span of Catching Fire and this book (especially this one--lots of emotional breakdown and growth... and breakdown). She finally learns what I think was the most important lesson in the trilogy, which is that trust and love mean possible betrayal and pain (the worst kind of pain), but they are risks worth taking because humans cannot survive alone.<br /><br />I also very much enjoyed how Collins managed to make an annoyingly devoted Peeta into an interesting character again. In the first book, it was like, \\"Well, is he or isn't he?\\" and then, \\"God, when the hell is Katniss going to realize?,\\" so that made him kind of interesting. And then in the second book, it was like, \\"Aw, poor guy, he's so in love\\" and, \\"Who's going to end up keeping who alive?,\\" so that made him kind of interesting there. But the same follow-Katniss-around-like-a-sad-puppy act wasn't going to be at all interesting if it kept up in the third book. I honestly thought the author would have no other choice but to kill himoff just to keep him likable (you know, a martyrdom strategy). The permanent \\"hijacking\\" was a cute alternative. Yes, they do end up together in the end anyway--with babies, even--but let's be real here, we all know that's what we really wanted in our heart of sappy hearts. At least, I did.<br /><br />One issue I did have with all three books: Suzanne Collins, have you ever heard of SENTENCE FRAGMENTS? I mean, I know the books aren't works of literary genius and they're geared toward a generation with goldfish attention spans, but it was just so glaringly excessive. It gives me nightmares imagining these books as Microsoft Word manuscripts, being blinded by green squiggly lines from all directions.

1451627289|5.0|In 2011 Jake Epping is just your average high school English and GED teacher is Stephen King's 11/22/63.  His life is changed the day he reads an essay from Harry Dunning, an older student, who tells the story of the day his father came home and murdered his entire family and then left Harry with a permanent limp.<br /><br />  Several days later his friend Al, who runs Al's diner, calls him to tell him an unbelieveable secret.  Inside his storage room is a portal to 1958.  Jake thinks Al is joking until he goes through the \\"rabbit hole\\" and finds himself back in 1958.  Returning back to 2011 he finds that Al has told him about the portal for a single reason; he wants Jake to go back and save the life of President John F. Kennedy.<br /><br />  After debating, Jake decides to go through the rabbit hole and live new his life in 1958 as George Amberson.  He has two priorities as he goes back to the Land of Ago; stop Harry Dunning's dad from murdering his family and stop Lee Harvey Oswald from killing Kennedy.  The only problem is the past is obdurate and it doesn't want to be changed.<br /><br />  The years between 1958 when Jake \\"George\\" Epping first goes into the past until 1963 when he must stop Oswald are described in detail.  His journey from Maine to Florida and finally to Texas are peppered with harmonies of where he's been and where he's going.  The side story of his journey, which turns out to be a main plot, is his meeting of Sadie, the new school librarian.  He and Sadie quickly fall in love but their relationship is far from blissful.<br /><br />  The story is historically accurate and I learned a lot about both Kennedy and Oswald.  It was also a fantastic look into what life was like in the late 50's and early 60's.  The world was a different place and Jake only hopes that by preventing Kennedy's assassination to make it a better place as well.<br /><br />  This book was unlike any other Stephen King book I've read.  The first few chapters build the case for going back into the past and once Jake gets there I was hooked.  The story of his life in the Land of Ago made me smile, it made me cry, and it left me on the edge of my seat wanting more.  The book is so descriptive that I felt like I was there in 1958 with him.<br /><br />  The last few chapters leading up to the ending were a total surprise for me.  I'm not sure anyone could predict what happens.  While this is a long book, I couldn't get through it fast enough.  I devoured every page and it left me thinking every time I put the book down.<br /><br />  The book leaves you with the final question; what would you do if you could change the future?  Would you make yourself happy or would you save the world?
B001NLKT60|5.0|This is the second book in the Millennium series by Stieg Larsson. It is about human and sex trafficking and the murder of three connected to Lisbeth Salander (from the first book). Enjoyed it every much.
B004024P0A|4.0|I bought these shoes for my 4-year-old.  She is able to run in them and they are easy for her to take on and off herself.  I like them  so much that she grew out of a pair and I bought her another in the same color!!  My 2-year-old has a pair and they don't fit her quite as well and they seem to fall off more.  My daughter likes them because there is still room for some Jibbitz too.
B004XKXI52|5.0|i love this show damon is my favorite and stephen ive been watching this since the beginning of when it started.
0061969656|4.0|If you haven't read any of the Saxon tales so far I recommend that you go back to \\"The Last Kingdom\\" and start there.  Uthred is one of Cornwell's best developed protagonists and you will want to follow him for six books as he grows from childhood to late middle age in this one.  Uthred is the perfect narrator and character, not wholly English and sympathetic to the Danes while fate and oaths have forced him to fight against them, Uthred fights for Alfred and his family dreaming of the day he can win back his family's fortress of Bebbanburg from his scheming uncle.  Uthred's band of warriors and rogues like Finan, Osferth, and Rypere are drawn well too, and it is always satisfying to see Uthred get the upper hand against the incompetent churchly beaurocrats that surround the royal family.<br /><br />The sixth installment of these books lived up to the first five.  The plot moves along well with elements of strategy and mystery.  There is plenty of swordplay and unique visions by the narrator into England in the late ninth century.  Spoiler alert - (but from the title you can probably guess) the death of Alfred is told with great attention to detail and pathos without slowing down the narrative.  Uhtred has now moved from a mere swordarm to a major political player in this novel and his ruminations on religion, life, warfare, and human nature are worth reading.  If you liked all the other books this one carries on the tradition well using recognized plot twists as the story culminates in a spectacular battle.  My only qualm with these is that they are beginning to be a big formulaic, but as Uthred is worth following and Cornwell is good at keeping the reader interested he probably has got me on the hook until the very end.  This whole series is worth reading because even if it does not manage to stay fresh in six books it remains highly readable and entertaining.<br /><br />Can't wait for book seven!
B00457WZEI|3.0|I had a long plane trip and needed something read during the flight.  So I got this book knowing a movie had just be made from it, but had yet to see it.  I found the book acceptably written. Acceptable because it was written for children and so I had to put that into consideration.<br /><br />The book was good because it was written in the horse's point of view.  Such creativity is always great to find.<br /><br />The book was not so good because the horse knew way too much about the things around it. It knew what guns were, roads, carts, people and their occupations. What's the point of having it in the horse's point of view if it sounds as though a person is actually speaking?  The reason this book gets three stars from me is how depressing and pointless over all it turned out.  Anyone who comes in contact with the horse ends up with terrible misfortune and bad things happen to the horse for no other purpose but to have bad things happen! It's like black beauty but despite the good conclusion at the end, leaves you with an over all gloomy feel and no real connections to the characters.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I'm a big fan of the point and click adventure games and this one is one of the best. it has beautiful scenery, an engaging plot, and will keep you entertained.
B007FH9GT2|5.0|When the movie first hit the theaters it looked interesting and the raves were positive. But I held out and didn't get to see it until now. Boy did I miss out on a great movie. Would have been awesome to see this on the big screen. I highly recommend this movie. its one of the best i have seen in a very long time. Im actually now going to go get the books and i never do that but the story is that good to make a non reader into going to borders and picking up the searies
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This was a great story. It had my heart from the start. It was a must read and the movie was a great<br />follow up to reading the book.
B007R41E8O|5.0|Yes, it is true you have to download an additional 350 mb before you can play but once that is done, and on wifi it took no more than 5 minutes for me, the game is simply put...Absolutely Amazing!<br /><br />The gameplay and graphics far exceed any I have seen in the hidden object/adventure for a tablet or mobile device. What is even more amazing is...all this for only 99 cents???  This plays JUST like the games you get on Big Fish Games for the PC not some stripped down nonsense. If you are a fan of the hidden object genre flavored with adventure, this is THE game for you hands down! You will not regret it. Besides, Alawar makes some of the best games in this genre. They have many excellent titles that are top notch and the best in the business.
1592537251|5.0|Really like the amount of illustrations, the quality of the content, and the artists statements about their work.  Especially enjoyed seeing where different artists discuss the materials they use.  Great book, especially for the outdoor sketchers , good inspiration.

B0056HTEC2|5.0|Hugh Laurie is absolutely wonderful and talented as an actor and now as a singer! To me it feels like his voice is made for the blues which makes this album perfect. The book in this special edition is also very nice, you could piece up some stories of the album's production in New Orleans from it; I had great fun reading it while listening to the CD.

B007V2UGPE|4.0|I like this game.  good for what it is.  graphics are good.  controls are simple enough.  keeps me occupied when I am waiting for something.
B001GLX6W6|4.0|I'm not sure what it is about this movie that attracted me.  Possibly the setting.  Possibly the presence of Patricia Clarkson--I like her as an actress.  Possibly the questions posed---and to some extent answered, either directly or indirectly.  What do we want, and why do we want it?  Who do we like, and why do we like them?  What are our goals, our dreams?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great when bored. it gets addicting when you want to unlock more games to play. you just can put it down.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I love the game but I don't like that the majority of the &quot;random&quot; opponents appear to be 8 years old....Also why do people write the puzzle instead of draw it? That takes away the fun and makes me want to uninstall the game!!!

B006W5JF9Y|5.0|As noted (most of the time) by previous reviewers, there are excellent reasons to purchase this 4-CD (plus on-line only bonus singles) collection of Dylan covers by artists ranging from Adele to Ziggy Marley, Michael Franti to DMB, QOTSA to Fistful of Mercy to Cash and Kristofferson.  There are also good reasons to look back on other cover collections too.  So there is \\"Nod to Bob 2\\" on his 70th birthday, a more consistently produced collection by Red House records that follows up their earlier \\"Nod to Bob\\" collection.  There is the widely acclaimed 30th anniversary concert, which includes Dylan himself on it, along with Neil Young, John Mellancamp et al.  And numerous collections more and less committed to Dylan's originating sensitivities, from the bluesy \\"Tangled up in Blues\\" (reissued MP3 as \\"This ain't no tribute series\\") to the subtle \\"Positively Pikes Peak.\\"
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put it down,well written,the words flowed right off the page. I ended up reading the trilogy in three days ! The concept of the book is one I haven't seen before, and you really get invested in the characters right away. I was concerned that it might be \\"a little too highschool\\" because it seems to be marketed towards teens, I was pleasantly surprised , it was a nice change of pace from the heavily information laden physics, biology, and theology genres that are my norm.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I Love this game no matter if I am bord or just annoyed by the people around me its a blast yo play
B003YUC2FE|5.0|This is such a great price for this product. It comes in a cute toy box with the DVD's inside. I am very pleased with this purchase.
B007BVOF8E|5.0|This was a great movie anybody that watches it should also watch the PBS original with Alec Guiness, this was created in 1979 and available in a four disc gift set
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Fun to play, Glu seems to get in right again.  Not the same as all the other games you see like this.  The upgrade ability is fun and the difficulty is challenging.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|I got this game last night and it is amazing. I cant stop playing it. it is amazing. good job NER brothers(;
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|SPOILER ALERT!! SPOILER ALERT!!!<br />The woman haunting the house is not the drowned child's mother. The haunting was going on, before the child ever drowned. The Woman In Black was in the photo taken of the family, while the child was still alive. She is in the background, in one of the windows. The drowned child is one of her victims! We do not know who the woman is or why she has cursed the village, as far as I can tell. The movie is different than the book. There has to be a reason why the children must die, when the woman has been seen. A taken and then drowned child makes absolutely no sense, as being the reason. The woman tried to let our hero know that the parents in the photo were not in any way involved, by scratching their faces off. The woman was enraged, when our hero left the boy's body on the bed, and did not solve the mystery. She, obviously, wanted his help. To do what, I just don't know, but there is something much more sinister behind this tale. She did not need or want the body of the child. Our hero missed the whole point.<br />The village has been cursed, for something that happened long before the boy drowned.<br />And, if not ... then why are they making a sequel. According to most of the reviews, the story has been told.<br />It has not!
0920668372|1.0|I reviewed and purchased children's books in a professional capacity for many years, and was actually shocked when I read this book. Other reviewers have mentioned the mother crawling in her grown-up son's bedroom window at night. Shudder. And yes! to the psychologist who mentioned this book models very poor relationships. It is also maudlin and sentimental, which could be forgiven. (In the biz we used to call guilty pleasures \\"a good read\\".) But I'm quite sure that many if not most children would find this frightening. I found it disturbing. But that's okay: I'm not 3 and likely to be scarred for life!
B004LWZW4W|5.0|Very good movie. It stands on its own.  I was surprised by the way the show pulled you into feeling for the  creature!

0439023521|4.0|I wanted to read this book before I went and saw the movie.  The book was very good and the whole trilogy is a must read!
193413712X|2.0|Nicely written for a first novel, but doesn't hit the mark as a Pulitzer winner for me. When I compare this book to past winners, it pales in quality by a long shot. The story seems to be a collage of the protagonist's (George) memories and the authors' attempt to thread them with the experiences of his father. Tinkers was certainly not plot-driven - the narrative moved forward slower than the proverbial snail.<br />I read this book on my Kindle and found that I could only take a few pages at a time with frequent glances at the marker line to see how much more was left to the story. I was repeatedly bored by the lack of movement and would stop - usually at one of the numerous jumps from George's dreams and visits to his past to his father's epilepsy attacks, the inner workings of a clock or how to build a bird's nest. I did a lot of paragraph scanning.<br />Perhaps the Pulitzer judges were so bored with that year's candidates that this is why they chose this very low key, depressing book as the winner.<br />It would be a great remedy for insomnia.
B0050QV0RQ|3.0|Not exactly what I would call 'knock down, drag out', but I wasn't exactly expecting Bay Blade either.<br /><br />The enemies going into the bosses are more than easy enough, but the end zone cronies are simply over kill harking back to to the dungeon master of yore that drank from the well of \\"Blood of ye enemy's\\" chug-a-lug...  I.e., there's simply no beating them without masses of experience & hit points accrued per putting your character's through a seemingly endless amount of re-visiting the same stomping grounds already visited time & again to horde enough loot to amass sufficient energy to survive the final protagonist's onslaught.<br /><br />Not exactly what I would call 'fun' if this is what it takes to advance to the next point in the game's plot line.  Otherwise, I missed something along the way in discovery during the quest...  I'm not 'that' clueless & the game isn't 'that' demeaning... so someone's vomited in the petunias here...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is fun but some of the games are hard. I would reccomend this app to e v e r y o n e !
0439023491|5.0|This is a good trilogy to read.  It has a good plot and you really find yourself caring about the outcomes of the characters.
0670023329|5.0|This book is not only riveting, it is a revelation.  It is testimony of man's cruelty to his fellow man.  It is almost unbelievable to think that there remain some \\"civilized\\" nations still dedicated to so aubsing its citizens.  Cruelty has taken on a new meaning.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I found out how to get out of the game. First you go to stuff then click settings. The menu bar should pop up. Its a good game I'm level nine.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I got the original Quell when it was the FAOTD and really enjoyed it.  When I finished that I paid for this one and I'm glad I did! It was mentally engaging and soothing I enjoyed reworking puzzles over and over until I got it perfect.  I hope they make a third one!

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|funtastic time in the old west... since I live near part of the Oregon trail this game draws me in further into its rich history.
038572179X|3.0|I was captivated by the first 80% of this book...but upon finishing Atonement? Was I the only one who was disappointed by the book's denoument? Quite not, it seems. I went back to read the one and two star Amazon reader reviews...most of them (excepting the single sentence jobs that describe the book as simply 'dull'or 'boring') are pretty spot on.<br /><br />This is the first McEwan book I've read but will probably be the last. So why three stars? Because: 1)the writing is elegant enough so that the reader is, at first, not bothered by plot inconsistancies  2)The lengthy chapters about Dunkirk and London's medical response to the evacuation are worth reading for the historical value alone. 3)Mr. McEwan's ability to get into the minds of his characters...particularly that of a conceited 13 year old girl(if my own memory serves me correctly)is impressive. For these reasons, I won't consider Atonement a waste of reading time.<br /><br />However, that last gimmicky chapter not only made me feel like I'd been had, but the final vignette was silly enough to practically nullify those previously stated positive qualities. It is interesting that the movie version (to the producer's credit) left that part out.<br /><br />Bottom line...Atonement starts out slowly as a leisurely piece of romantic fiction, revs up to a grimly accurate history lesson, swerves into a mediocre whodunnit, then screeches to a grinding halt, splashing the reader with pure sap.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|yay! !!! now they need temple run!!!!  I lpve this and am soooooooooo soooooooooo sooooooooooo sooooooooo glad they got it!!! This game is addicting
B007PTJOV0|4.0|If you are a big fan of platforming games that feature cartoon characters breaking bricks with their heads and stomping on animals, you will enjoy this. Its very reminiscent of that plumber dude, minus the power flower.
0385344228|2.0|**spoilers ahead**<br />A teenager stabs another teenager 3 times in a perfectly straight line? The victim never moved? Never fought back? No sign of any struggle? All the victim did was say \\"Stop, you're hurting me?\\"  I found this too unbelievable.<br />A man in prison for years gets another guy to commit a murder and stage it as a suicide? How did this come about? Why would a guy commit murder for a prison mate? No explanation offered. And if this guy's intention was to stage a suicide, why was he hanging around and parking in front of the Barber house?<br />I also found it hard to believe that the mother would hit a cement wall at 98mph and live to stand trial.<br />I found too many holes in this story.  And, IMHO, the idea of a \\"murder gene\\" is just plain silly.<br />Some of the writing in this book is good, but I found a lot of dialogue to be stilted.<br />I read this book because of glowing newspaper reviews. I gave it 2 stars because, while I didn't hate it, I think it is highly overrated.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game!  works awesome on my Kindle Fire!!! very smooth and lots of fun!  I also use on my HTC EVO 3D and runs great on that too!
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I was really upset to find that I could not use the amazon mp3 app on my samsung note. That was part of the reason I switched to the not from my iphone was so I could stream my music from amazon cloud player. Hopefully it gets fixed.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|She's got a grenade, said the chief, take a shot.Chris hesitates, then takes out his guitar,sings and plays Cumbaya.Well not exactly.He pulls the trigger of his rifle and blows away the savage witch, saving some Marines lives.Here begins the story of Chris Kyles awesome autobiography with help from Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice.A fast paced story of Chris's childhood, life as a cowboy,and then gets into his time as a Navy Seal.This is a brutal telling of what war really is and is not.I loved the honesty of Chris and Taya his beautiful and loving wife.She has more than a handful of heartache to deal with when Chris is away in combat.The sacrifice of family needs as well as her own are well told here.She is certainly a hero in her own right.I absolutely recommend this book if you are interested in Chris's work as a Navy Seal Sniper! Its a real brutal book,of war, death,morbid humor,love,betrayal look at what they (soldiers) face everyday.I couldnt imagine how horrible it is to be in war,the stench,the oppressive heat but with Chris's book you get a safe glimpse of what he does and how he feels about it.Great book Chris and thanks for your and Taya's wonderful service and sacrifice for our country. On CSPAN BOOK TV ,if you type in Chris Kyle in search, there is a hour long interview with Chris about his book and Chris gets quite a few callers questions to answer also.Chris is donating the proceeds from his book to the families of the 2 fallen Seals, Marc Lee and Ryan Job and charities that help veterans of war
B006W0QOF2|1.0|We had a lot of fun doing \\"pop video style\\" commentary. Minimal dialogue. Cliched characters. Awful d-list soundtrack. You could tell they were going for a certain style but it wasn't worth going for.
B00637TV1I|5.0|I was drawn in by the lure of the free 'Endless Summer' track. So many bands these days are very one-dimensional and lack depth, I was wondering whether this would be another 'almost' album- you know, the ones where it sounds good in the previews, only to later find out afterwards you wasted your money. Not so with this album. I am not a music junky, I don't follow all the latest bands and pop charts, but I believe I know how to appreciate good music. Well, this is not good music- it's great music. This band is wildly talented and within their songs I hear the remnants of so many great voices, so many favorite bands, all composed with such great beats to blend it all together. This is what music should be, and it's refreshing to see such unique and original talent in world where music has become far too commercialized, drowning out legitimate bands and artists. Those on the fence about this album can rest assured, this is genuinely great music. I have not listened to an album all the way through for years until this one came along.

B003UD7JEO|5.0|Nikita is fast-paced and action-packed and the characters are complicated.  The story line is excellent.  The characters are intriguing and well cast, especially Maggie Q as Nikita.  You feel like you're watching a movie, and you can't wait to see what's going to happen next.  There's also a lot of duplicity and just plain crazy situations that keep you at the edge of your seat, so I definitely recommend watching this series - it is super entertaining!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I like this game because you can play with your friends on facebook and I think everyone likes this game even old even young people
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read a good deal of books, mostly through Kindle now, and there are only a few authors whose books are required reading for me (Richard Phillips 'The Rho Agenda series', Stephenie Myer known for Twilight, but her 'The Host' book was her best piece of work, Suzanne Collins 'The Hunger Games', David W. Wright & Sean Platt 'Yesterday's Gone Series', and J.R. Rain 'Vampire for Hire Series'). Hugh Howey, creator of Wool 'Silo Series' & The Bern Saga (series), is another author I am adding to that list. I have read all the installments of the Silo Series and it is just amazing.<br /><br />Howey writes with just the right amount of scene & setting, and his ability to gradually build up character development is very impressive. The story is suspenseful, exciting, emotional, and even in the face of extreme hardships, and what seems a valid reason for just \\"giving up\\" it somehow becomes inspirational. There is psychological, social, & political drama, action, romantic tensions & loss, and so much more that make this story worth reading.<br /><br />The setting, and the story allow for this to be used as a long running story for any wise television network. Due to the location, it is a manageable set cost, and someone should at HBO or SciFi channel should be all over this Silo Series. It is destined to be as popular as the Hunger Games series.<br /><br />I am reading The Bern Saga now (just started) and I am already glad I started.<br /><br />Congratulations Mr. Howey - you are an incredible writer, and have written a believable, exciting, engaging, emotional, and thought-provoking apocalyptic drama that I believe most everyone could enjoy, even those who don't consider themselves sci-fi fans.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Yahoo! Mail works very well on the Kindle Fire. It's an easy way to view, read, and delete messages. A useful and worthwhile app for the Kindle Fire.
0345803485|1.0|I HATED this book! I made myself keep reading it thinking, \\"a lot of people like this so it must get better.\\" No, it didn't. I found this to be absolutely repulsive and I am no prude. Christian came off as a jerk to me and I wondered the whole time why she liked him. I can not understand why this book is popular. It was poorly written, didn't have a decent story line, and idolized an extremely dysfunctional relationship.
B006O5XYWG|3.0|The film was predictable.  Anyone who enjoys retribution for harming animals will appreciate this film.  When the bad guys get their pay back we all feel good inside.  When they get their pay back by non-humans we feel even better.  We all know they deserve everything they get and got.  Hurray for the apes!  But, that was about all there was.
0374203032|5.0|It's like another extension of \\"Justice\\" and \\"the Case Against Perfection\\", but simply better in a sense that all examples are real, not hypothetical. (The Case Against Perfection is also discussing real situations, but quite distant from me...)<br /><br />I remember once I told my affluent Tibetan friend in Lhasa that he could apply for the Platinum Account at a local bank and \\"cut the line\\", he insisted not simply \\"because there are so many old people waiting at the bank\\", he felt bad of cutting their lines.<br /><br />Thinking about this scenario, he was actually criticizing the moral rights of jumping queues.<br /><br />I may ask him to read this book as well.<br /><br />When discussing fines vs fees, Prof Sandel mentioned that video rentals should not be treated as public library, he thought it was acceptable to return the videos later and pay the \\"fee\\", and should not be treated as bad customers.<br /><br />I remember when I was young, there was a small shop renting out books and comics near my home. The owner kept a reservation list for some popular titles and told me the estimated time of return by other customers when I place a reservation. Sometimes I was disappointed if the books were returned late by other paid customers.<br /><br />Yes, you may say the book rental was a business and the purpose was to make money by renting books, but I did think the late returners were wrong because they disappointed me as they didn't fulfill their promise of returning the books on time and kept other customers waiting for longer than necessary. They also messed up the reservation list. In short, they treated the fines as fees.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love playing games. The games are the best! They are fun and very entertaining! You can play for hours!
B001TODCII|5.0|I watched this movie the other day at my friend's house and saw nothing that was extended on it other than maybe 2-3 seconds of the opening scene where they show a picture of his daughter on a pony and that was it, this is a joke to release a great movie such as this and call it extended cut, i gave the 5 stars for the film not the version. Save your money if you have the regular version then stick with it if not then i guess you can pick this one but once again there's nothing in there that you'll be missing.
B006Z7Z3R2|2.0|My friend posted on facebook how this is the best film of the year...wow i know good movies seem way to few and far between these days but this movie SUCKED. Thank god i spent only 4 bucks to rent it off amazon. Trust me guys this movie has like 2 scares MAYBE with little real plot and storytelling. PLEASE stay far away from this one, the acting is awful, the story (what story) is just awful, and the ending (cant even spoil it for you as there is no ending). It was a chore to get through and when you are finished you should expect mony to see it!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I really really wanted this app to be available on the kindle fire and I looked for months just hoping that it would come out!!!!!! and it finally has!!!!

B005OSUL9I|5.0|[[ASIN:B005OSUL9I Donizetti: Anna Bolena [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />I decided to buy this DVD when I saw the Metropolitan Production on PBS public television which I enjoyed very much, both are very good, but my interest now is to write about the one that I bought.<br />I knew some of the cast: Anna Netrebko ,Elena Garanca and Idelbrando D'Arcangelo from other productions, and I could see their transformations in each of the roles they had previously done.<br />The main character, Anna Bolena played by Anna Netrebko was outstanding; she had to show great stamina to maintain the power of her role singing for a very long time and acting at the same time to be able to perform the complexity of this character.<br />Enrico VIII and Giovanna Seymour played by D'Arcangelo and Elena Garanca respectively were in a similar level as the main character. The rest of the cast was very good.<br />At the beginning of the opera Enrico VIII has an affair with Giovanna Seymour and wants to annuli his marriage with Anna Bolena ,to do so he has to make a plan to probe that she is the one who is unfaithful ,to achieve this plan he looks for Lord Richard Percy  who is in love with Anna and after falls in the trap, Smeton, a page who also is in love with Anna is caught and tortured until he admitted that she is unfaithful. Enrico  tried to press her to admit that she has an affair ,she denies even though she later admit that she is in love with Percy and they were married before she met and marry the king.<br />Enrico VIII is a very cruel man an condemns all the people who are in the plot: Lord Richard Percy, Anna's brother, Smeton and of course Anna who later is executed which was very dramatically shown at the end of the opera.<br />The direction of this performance was perfect as well as the costumes and scenery which showed the era of Enrico VIII as well as England at that time.<br />The performers were very powerful .The music is very beautiful like all Donizetti's compositions.<br />Thequality of the DVD is outstanding I gave it 5 stars.
0312576463|5.0|I was considering giving this book 4 stars because of the way it started to make me feel: depressed. It has a tendency to get a little political and apocalyptic about the world. But then I decided if a book can have this great of effect on me then it deserves 5 stars. The writing is breathtaking. I have never read a book before than breathes such life into its characters. I found the characters to be truly likeable because they were amazingly real. Completely hypocritical, exhaustively complex, and completely emotional. Mr. Franzen explores the human psyche in such a revealing and complete way it is seriously haunting. There are no black or white characters in this book. And after finishing it I feel like I deeply know these people because they are true examples of the baffling complexity of humanity.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote to make chapter outlines for school and other notes to help me study; my learning process has gone virtually paperless. The best thing is: I can read my notes from my Kindle or my phone! Awesome!

0375842209|5.0|This is by far the most hauntingly beautiful book I have ever read in my life and quickly became my favorite.  The characters are well developed and the story is beautifully written.  The author clearly did his research and does a wonderful job bringing the reader into Liesel Meminger's world.  This story elicits so much emotion from the reader that I felt as though I personally knew each and every character.<br />I recommend this book to everyone who asks me for recommendations.  This was truly one of those very rare books that I wished would not come to an end.
0345803485|2.0|I gave this two stars because I did in fact finish it. It's pretty much like Twilight except minus any mediocre creativity or plot. The writing is just as bad if not much worse and the characters are so two dimensional and unlikable that by the end of the exhaustively repetitive dialogue between them (IE: STOP BITING YOUR LIP, HOLY MOSES, and EAT ANA) I couldn't care less about what happens to them.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|The final instalment of the hunger games, truly is a masterpiece. i wasn't sure how the series would end  but again the plot and the character development is again just WOW. I don't want to give much away but there are a few BIG twists which add to a book that is already a master piece!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is fun and addicting.  Have not stopped playing it since I downloaded it.  Only complaint is that if you don't spend real money it takes a long time to get things done.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this book because I wanted to see what all of the hype was about and, frankly, I am completely baffled.  While the general story was decent, I just could not get past the writing.  The author is repetitive and unbelievably juvenile.  Every other paragraph, someone is gasping, rolling, their eyes, biting their lip, or going on about her \\"inner goddess\\".  I just cannot bring myself to read through three books where nothing happens except what I have just listed.<br />The main character, Ana, is ridiculously childish and insecure.  This proved to be incredibly frustrating for me because I could not help but view her character as downright pathetic.  This story should have remained what it started out as, because it truly is worthy enough to only be Twilight fanfiction  and NOT a stand alone novel.  If you want to feed into the hype, go ahead and give this book a try.  If you are actually looking for a GOOD book to read, don't waste your money on this one.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|is fun and easy to get out of for those people that cant figure out how to get out of it. you just go in to options and then settings. it brings up the arrow across the bottom.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|WOW! please read this book and the following two. The three part series is so much more mature then the harry potter series, which makes its i believe a better book series. the author has really come up with an awesome idea which she has delivered on, unbelievable read!

630542845X|5.0|Truly under-appreciated. I would not describe the film as \\"well-intentioned\\"; it's thoughtful rather than preachy and it succeeded in inspiring and uplifting me. I would recommend it to film lovers and young people of all ages, though not children - there are some painful scenes. The only thing I don't like about Powder is that there isn't enough Jeff Goldblum, but the wide-eyed, passionate Jeff Gaoldblum you do get is well worth 9 bucks.

B0019N94X6|5.0|WARNING: If you attempt to approach Brian De Palma's incredibly over-blown, bloated \\"epic crime drama\\" as a drama, you will be horrifically disappointed. However... if you look at this film (scripted very seriously by Oliver Stone) as an epic comedy filled with eminently quotable lines, ridiculous Cuban accents where everyone sounds like Chico Marx, faux-Hispanic spray-tans of white actors that would make the cast of JERSEY SHORE look on in disgust, and an utter waste of talent, this is the film for you.<br /><br />Pacino's scenery-chewing is on par with his other deliciously awe-inspiring but truly terrible performances as SCENT OF A WOMAN and DEVIL'S ADVOCATE. The rest of the characters, with the exception of Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio giving a strong performace, are not actually fleshed-out characters: They're cliches. Steven Bauer is the loyal lieutenant with an eye for the ladies; Michelle Pfieffer is the bleach-blonde coke-whore trophy wife; Robert Loggia as the old mentor/boss who's on the way out; the great F. Murray Abraham as a duplicitous scumbag... and that's really it to speak of. The rest of the characters are just scenery.<br /><br />The people who say that they love this film because of its sprawling \\"epic\\" quality and put it on par with films like truly great films such as GOODFELLAS and THE GODFATHER films... I don't know what to say to you. I won't insult you by telling you you're not intelligent or that you have no taste, but I won't agree with you either. I allow for there to be a sort of purgatory of opinions about this film. Everyone is able to get along better that way.<br /><br />Seriously, this is a comedy. It has to be, because NOTHING about it works as a drama. Hollywood, after years of hearing his laughter echoing their production offices after he cashed their paychecks, has finally seen that Brian De Palma was the worst working director in Hollywood. He thankfully hasn't made a major film since the 100% dreadful THE BLACK DAHLIA (which is on my list of one of the five worst films ever made and is a film so horrifically bad, it makes me dizzy to even think about it), but built his reputation from films like BLOW-OUT, DRESSED TO KILL and this film here before he actually made the one great film in his career, THE UNTOUCHABLES, which is more thanks to the script of David Mamet and performances by Robert De Niro, Kevin Costner and Sean Connery and uncharacteristically inspired camerawork. I could go on and on about how utterly pathetic De Palma is as a filmmaker, but I won't. The vein in my forehead is starting to bulge.<br /><br />Pacino, whose performances swing between somewhat nuanced and powerful to flamboyantly (and mostly comically) loud and obnoxious, is DEFINITELY using the latter here. The magic and power we've seen come before from Pacino in films like PANIC IN NEEDLE PARK, the first two GODFATHER films, DOG DAY AFTERNOON, ...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL and SERPICO is all gone here and with SCARFACE, we officially enter the second part of his career: Pacino the Loud. Sadly, loud should not be confused with power. Yes, I understand that Tony Montana is volatile. He's not shrewd though and he's entirely with guile; he's a stupid, violent, greedy thug and there's no way he should have made it past the food stand near the beginning let alone become the most powerful drug kingpin in Miami. The film makes insane leaps in logic at times (, and of course, has the standard montage sequence required by every film in the early 80's.<br /><br />It could be argued that the film's story and its style are reflective of that era and that could somehow explain why this \\"drama\\" might feel dated and not as powerful. That is an excuse I've never bought into and never will. Films that are supposed to be great are timeless. Which is why this film will always be funny to me. It is powerfully hilarious, and once you start looking at this film as a comically cliched and somewhat offensively-stereotyped moronic thug who, regarless of any sensible or explicable reason, becomes the most powerful drug lord on the East Coast... you've got comic gold. It's kind of like the drug version of THE HUDSUCKER PROXY.<br /><br />So say good night to the bad guy.egarless of any sensible or explicable reason, becomes the most powerful drug lord on the East Coast... you've got comic gold.

B004FHCH96|5.0|MEMENTO: Christopher Nolan's groundbreaking film that revealed to the world that he was one of the most unique new voices in cinema; a man that would prove to be one of the best filmmakers of the last two decades.<br /><br />I saw this film when it first came out in theaters, and I haven't seen it since. So why the 5-star rating? I was so totally compelled and profoundly disturbed by the film that it falls into the category of \\"Brilliant Films I'll Never See Again\\" (Another recent example of that is MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE). Guy Pearce is the kind of actor who never seems to get the acclaim he so richly deserves, and he's astonishing as Leonard. Joey Pants (Pantoliano) is chewing up a good deal of scenery in this film and certainly appears to steal some scenes, but Pearce's self-effacing charm and quiet intensity make you unable to take your eyes off him. Carrie-Anne Moss doesn't amount to as much as I would have preferred, although that may be more to do with her rather uninteresting performance.<br /><br />When you get right down to it, the film ultimately belongs to Nolan. By using the reverse-order single-scene narrative, he makes a film that is very uncomfortable to watch since the film essentially is taking place inside Leonard's fractured mind. Being inside of a mind like that is such a disturbing place to be, and I think that's what keeps me from watching the film again, but I can still say without a doubt, I still realize what a powerful, suspenseful and great film MEMENTO is, and I am doubly glad that Chris Nolan continues to make films that not only defy Hollywood convention, but they also push you and challenge your ideas. In another life, Nolan designed great mazes and created great riddles. In this life, you get to see them unfold on-screen, even if you don't get the answer or find the exit.<br /><br />With the exception of INSOMNIA, which is a film I respect but don't like, Nolan has made some of the very best films of the last decade. From THE PRESTIGE to BATMAN BEGINS to THE DARK KNIGHT to INCEPTION and MEMENTO, Nolan is now a name on par with the very best cinema has to offer.IGE to BATMAN BEGINS to THE DARK KNIGHT to INCEPTION and MEMENTO, Nolan is now a name on par with the very best cinema has to offer.

B001BEG2LK|5.0|There have only been a few moments in my music-listening history where I have been absolutely floored, just knocked backward, by a band.  Those moments are what keeps me picking through all the garbage metal that keeps piling up; just the chance that I might stumble upon something as good as Powerslave.  It was my first Iron Maiden album.  I remember being at the record store to buy the new Kiss album (I think it was Animalize).  Right next to it on the display sat Powerslave.  I knew of Maiden, but had never listened to them.  Derek Riggs' cover art was so insanely cool, and there was so much going on there, it demanded closer inspection.  I put Animalize back on the shelf and bought Powerslave, purely because of the cover, without having ever heard Maiden play a note.<br />At home, the living room stereo (which had seen nothing heavier than Queen's News of the World) suddenly delivered the ferocious intro to Aces High, and that was all it took.  That was the moment.  The world was changed, and there was no going back.  Kiss?  What Kiss?  Who cares about Kiss; would you listen to what's coming from the stereo?  Do you hear the twin guitar leads? Can you feel that bass rumbling down through your feet?  And, for the love of God, the singer!  Do you hear what he's doing with his voice?  Who can sing like that?<br />Every song on this album is a powerhouse.  You've got metal classics like Aces High, 2 Minutes to Midnight, Powerslave - and at the tail end, where most bands stick their throwaway songs, Rime of the Ancient Mariner, arguably one of Maiden's best songs.  That's one of my favorite things about Iron Maiden - they shatter the metal stereotype, and at the same time, define what is metal.  They can pull off an intelligent song taken from a poem written in 1798, and make it head-shakingly heavy.  This album is the quintessential Maiden album.  It's got the Maiden \\"gallop\\".  It's got some of the best bass lines you will ever hear. It's got the twin harmony leads.It's got Bruce taking his voice places no human voice should ever see.  It's got the 14-minute epic closer.  And, of course, it's got plenty of Eddie all over the album art.<br />Like I said, there have only been a few times my jaw has hit the floor upon hearing something new.  One was the first time I heard Metallica (it was Metal Militia, on a late-night metal radio show).  Another was Faith No More's The Real Thing.  And Powerslave, the first time I heard Iron Maiden.  I cannot overstate how good this album is.  It's damn near the perfect metal album.  It's the reason I still rifle through the new metal releases every Tuesday (though it's online now, and not a record bin).  Because there's still a chance that someday, somewhere, someone will make an album as good as Powerslave.
0062119044|4.0|\\"We Need To Talk About Kevin\\" manages to be a enthralling, provocative, melancholic, beautiful and incredibly annoying read.<br />The story revolves around the mother of a high school massacre perpetrator, and they way she deals, or doesn't with having a child she never really loved and a child who became a killer.<br />Now a motion picture with Tilda Swinton, the main character of the story, the mother, is a hard to love kind of character. She tries to come to terms with her emotions for a child she never connected with, and who turned out to be just as awful as she always feared.<br /><br />Throughout \\"Kevin's\\" childhood he is a stubborn, unlovable and mean child. He wore diapers until he was six and refuses to see the joy in any of the activities usually adored by children. Eva, the mother, struggles to convince her husband of Kevins \\"off-ness\\" or unsettling persona, but the father, tragically, refuses to acknowledge this, and Eva is alone to deal with the stranger in their pram. Kevin is rude, arrogant, aggressive, antisocial and difficult. Kevin destroys everything Eva loves, bit by bit. The only thing Kevin really likes is to destroy what her mother loves.<br /><br />The novel is written in the form of letters to her husband, letters written after the school massacre, and retells the story of their marriage, pregnancy, raising of Kevin, and their daughter Celia, and eventually the massacre and Kevin's imprisonment.<br /><br />But however annoying the Eva character can be, Kevin is presented as evil incarnate. From the first fifty pages you'll hate Kevin with a vengeance; And each deprived prank he performs, each utterance, each word, each movement, serves to make you loath and despise this Kevin.<br /><br />However, one thing gives this book four stars instead of five. The story is written in Eva narration, now, she is a classic example of unreliable narrator, but that is not the problem. The entire story is written in the most annoying stuck-up, arrogant language I have ever read. \\"Eva\\" peppers the narration with constant alliterations, unnecessary interjections and all in all a very pseudo-intellectual language. At first you might assume that this is how Shriver writes. But it isn't. It is a part of the character of Eva. And though it might serve as a good way of sketching the character, it eventually becomes frustrating and annoying.<br />The character is unlovable enough: She is arrogant and stuck-up because of her travels around the world and has a strong case of 'holier than thou' syndrome; She verbally attacks anyone she considers less smart than her, which is everyone. Page after page, Eva insists on throwing her vocabulary around to impress the reader.<br />I think Shriver is trying to play Nabokov in Lolita, but the result is not pleasant, poetic or has any of the aspects that makes the language is Lolita beyond sublime.<br />The story would survive fine without this use of language.<br /><br />An example:<br />\\"I admit, I tried to make him mad today. I was determined to make him feel small, not the deep dark impenetrable conundrum of Our Contemporary Society, but the butt of a joke, hoisted on his own retard. Because every time Kevin takes another bow as Evil Incarnate, he swells a little larger. Each slander slewed in his direction - nihilistic, morally destitute, depraved, degenerate or debased - bulks his scrawny frame better than my cheese sandwiches ever did.\\" p.245<br /><br />But, it is still a good read, and a riveting and alluring tale of parenthood, marriage and evil nature.

0345803485|1.0|Reading this book I wondered what we women burnt our bras for!  It is so demeaning to imply that women need to be dominated, not just sexually, but in where we go, who we see, even what we eat?  And we worry about the Taliban's treatment of women. I can imagine this book being written by a fantasising man, and hopefully all women would laugh at him, but the saddest part is that 50 Shades of Grey is written by a woman. EL James is pandering to the attitude that when a woman says NO she really means YES.  That is very dangerous.

B004XDYJRU|5.0|As a radio-listening nut for more than 50 years, I have never come across a product -- software or hardware (i.e, radio receiver) -- as amazing as this. It has turned my Android phone, my iPod Touch, and my Kindle Fire into an incredible radio, capable of listening to virtually every station in North America and most in the world, AM, FM or shortwave -- plus a ton of wonderful internet-only outlets. Even more amazing, it will let millions of Americans listen to their local fire and, often, police departments. It is user-friendly, multifunctional, and fun to use. Whether you want to listen to music, news, talk, comedy, or drama -- they are all there in great numbers -- this app will open the world of internet radio to anyone who loves to listen.<br />PS: While the free app is all most people would ever need, I would recommend the \\"professional\\" version for a measly buck, if for no other reason than to support the creative minds who created this wonderful software. Plus, you can record and save programs with the pro -- amazing in itself, compared to the \\"old days\\" of over-the-air radio.
B0034G4ORC|1.0|The movie starts with Staff sergeant Nance retiring after a 20 year career in the military before being brought back to deal with an alien invasion. We learn that some of his men had died on his last mission and he feels guilty. Knowledge of his failed mission makes the other marines he encounters question whether or not he values the lives of his men. Since it is not that unusual for marines to die in battle, I wrongly assumed that later in the movie they would reveal that Nance had made a big blunder in leadership for the marines to treat him like a pariah. Nope, all that is ever revealed is that people died. After making a long winded, uninspired speech about how much it haunts him that his men died, he wins over the softest group of marines in movie history, and they discover the secret for defeating the enemy; shooting at their communications ship.<br /><br />Every time someone dies they stop the action to play the sad music and show the pained expressions of every character in the film. There is plenty of time to do this while a battle that has destroyed most of Los Angeles is being waged.<br /><br />For those who watch the behind the scene footage, the cast does it's best to convince us this is a ground-breaking movie because never before have we seen a military movie with aliens (Yep, Independence Day, Starship troopers, etc do not exist in their world). They also try to convince viewers that a hand-held camera style movie with big effect shots is revolutionary. It borrows so much from movies like Cloverfield, Saving Private Ryan, and the 2004-2009 Battlestar Galactica that it is difficult to find something new in this movie.<br /><br />The characters are so poorly developed that it is difficult to care when one dies. I didn't realize I was supposed to care about the death of a character until the hokey soundtrack started pleading with me to be moved. I doubt I'll remember anything about this movie in a year.

As each housewife deals with becoming parents and the story now benefiting from the five year advance, I felt that creator Marc Cherry did what he can to help jumpstart the series.<br /><br />The sixth season was similar to the second season in some ways as a secretivefamily moves to Wisteria Lane and a strangler was on the loose.  But for this seventh season, \\"Desperate Housewives\\" goes back to the basics by retaining similar storylines of another creepy person moving into Wisteria Lane (but this time, a familiar face), bringing a new character to the mix as part of the housewives group and last, focusing on the lives of each character.<br /><br />While I did find the seventh season to be entertaining, I do feel that the writers are really trying hard to find ways to put a damper on the life of these housewives.<br /><br />Susan and Mike continue to be a couple who face challenges but this time financial and also a health scare that hits the family hard.<br /><br />But this time around, I feel that the writers wanted to make sure the wives and their families get full coverage and thus we have ex-housewife, Bree involved in two relationships throughout the course of the season.  But the ones that face the most emotional damage is Gabrielle, who finds out that Juanita is not her true blood daughter and when she meets her real daughter, she has a hard time coping.  But to make matters worse is part of her past comes back to haunt her.<br /><br />The character I feel that the writers tried to zero in on is Lynette.  Part of me feels so bad for this character because she had to go through cancer, going back to work and so many other problems that she and her family are constantly have to face.  I was hoping that the writers would at least take it easy with Lynette in the seventh season but I get a feeling that because she is strong-willed and opinionated, she is the character that will be facing extreme difficulties in her marriage.  In some ways, with every character being divorced, you would have hoped Marc Cherry and fellow writers to have at least one person have a good marriage (yes, not perfect but still have a marriage intact).<br /><br />I do feel the addition of Vanessa Williams to the cast is pretty cool.  But in some ways, her character is almost like her diva character on \\"Ugly Betty\\".  Snooty, uptight and judgmental.  But it's great to see her on the shoe but it's obvious that her character being the newcomer of the group, is not yet being welcomed with open arms.<br /><br />We do know that the next season of \\"Desperate Housewives\\" will be the final season and I just hope Marc Cherry can at least give closure to fans as many of us have invested into the show for so many years.  And while the series tends to have its good seasons and OK seasons, I have to say that the seventh season was very good.  Hilarious, emotional, entertaining and so many things were introduced this season but with that being said, it's a bit farfetched this time around, especially seeing a riot hit Wisteria Lane.  It's one thing for a tornado or a an airplane but a riot?  I don't know about that.<br /><br />But the riot scene episode was still very entertaining but I do feel that the shocking storylines that the series is known for, wasn't so shocking by the second half of the season.  In fact, the way the series ended made me think of another ABC series, ABC Family's \\"Pretty Little Liars\\".  It's almost cliche to see something like this happen but at the same time, these women are very good friends and they would always back each other up.<br /><br />I don't know if I agree with the series finale but I can only hope that things work itself out by the final eighth season.<br /><br />As for \\"Desperate Housewives: The Complete Seventh Season - Wild, Wild Wisteria Edition\\", the DVD set is good, but considering that the last season set and even previous releases had audio commentary, this time around, we only get a few featurettes and that was a bit of a surprise.  I was expecting a bit more in terms of special features.<br /><br />Overall, If you are a fan of \\"Desperate Housewives\\", then \\"Desperate Housewives: The Complete Seventh Season - Wild, Wild Wisteria Edition\\" is a good season, just not their best.  Still, if you invested so much time in watching this comedy/drama series, then this seventh season is definitely recommended!family moves to Wisteria Lane and a strangler was on the loose.

I don't know about that.<br /><br />But the riot scene episode was still very entertaining but I do feel that the shocking storylines that the series is known for, wasn't so shocking by the second half of the season.  In fact, the way the series ended made me think of another ABC series, ABC Family's \\"Pretty Little Liars\\".  It's almost cliche to see something like this happen but at the same time, these women are very good friends and they would always back each other up.<br /><br />I don't know if I agree with the series finale but I can only hope that things work itself out by the final eighth season.<br /><br />As for \\"Desperate Housewives: The Complete Seventh Season - Wild, Wild Wisteria Edition\\", the DVD set is good, but considering that the last season set and even previous releases had audio commentary, this time around, we only get a few featurettes and that was a bit of a surprise.  I was expecting a bit more in terms of special features.<br /><br />Overall, If you are a fan of \\"Desperate Housewives\\", then \\"Desperate Housewives: The Complete Seventh Season - Wild, Wild Wisteria Edition\\" is a good season, just not their best.  Still, if you invested so much time in watching this comedy/drama series, then this seventh season is definitely recommended!

B006HGXGWU|4.0|When a family begins to have nightmares that begin to change his life and affect his family and job, many wonder if he is going crazy.<br /><br />Receiving rave reviews from critics nationwide is the 2011 film \\"Take Shelter\\" written and directed by Jeff Nichols (\\"Shotgun Stories\\").  The film stars Michael Shannon (\\"Vanilla Sky\\", \\"Pearl Harbor\\", \\"Bad Boys II\\") and Jessica Chastain (\\"The Help\\", \\"The Tree of Life\\").<br /><br />\\"Take Shelter\\" screened at the Cannes Film Festival in 2011 and won the 50th Critics' Week Grand Prix and won various film awards internationally.<br /><br />And now the film will be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Take Shelter\\" is presented in 2:35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen and presented in English 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH and French.  First, I just want to add that  if anyone wants to experience the best picture and audio quality for \\"Take Shelter\\", you will definitely want to watch this movie on Blu-ray!<br /><br />With that being said, \\"Take Shelter\\" looks very good on DVD.  There are a lot of scenes that are shot outdoors, scenes with blue skies are vibrant. While I was watching this film on DVD, I kept telling myself of how beautiful those scenes would look in HD!  I didn't notice any problems with the overall picture quality, the film looks very good on DVD.<br /><br />As for audio, the soundtrack features certain dream sequences that utilize the surround channels.  From Curtis' dog attacking him, getting into an accident, hearing the sounds of the crackling storm to the reality sequences such as ambiance during one crowd scene during a fight.  Overall, dialogue is clear, action sequences sound good on DVD.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Take Shelter\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Commentary with Jeff Nichols & Michael Shannon - Featuring in-depth commentary by director Jeff Nichols and actor Michael Shannon.<br />  Behind the Scenes of Take Shelter - (10:35) Writer and director Jeff Nichols talks about how he came up with \\"Take Shelter\\", the actors talk about their character and the film.<br />  Q&A with Michael Shannon & Shea Whigham - (19:51) Featuring a Q&A session with actors Michael Shannon and Shea Wigham discussing how the film came about and their characters.<br />  Deleted Scenes - (6:00) Featuring two deleted scenes: Second Counselor Session and Picnic Table<br />  Theatrical Trailer  - (2:12) The original theatrical trailer for \\"Take Shelter\\".<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />A unique story with a twist ending, writer/director Jeff Nichols' \\"Take Shelter\\" is a film that will surprise you but also captivate you with the wonderful performances by Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain!<br /><br />I have to admit that when I first watched the trailer for \\"Take Shelter\\", the first thing that came into my mind was the Russell Crowe 2001 film, \\"A Beautiful Mind\\".<br /><br />Is this another film about schizophrenia?  But there is no denying that when this film started to win one award after another, perhaps there was more to this film than what we are given in the trailer.  And there is also no denying that the director of 2007 \\"Shotgun Stories\\", Jeff Nichols is a person that has creative ideas and suffice to say, his name is being mentioned quite often.  The same can also be said for the film's talents, Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain.  And so far, Chastain has literally made me a fan with her performances on \\"The Tree of Life\\", \\"The Help\\" and her bit part in the \\"Texas Killing Fields\\".<br /><br />But it's Nichols story that starts to unnerve viewers. Here is a normal family that will probably be destroyed by the actions of the protagonist Curtis.  He's a hardworking family man, but when he starts having these dark nightmares of being attacked and getting in accidents with his daughter and needless to say, he starts to act on them.  You know that things are not going to look good for Curtis.<br /><br />And as for the apocalyptic dream of a major storm coming his way, its the big part of the storyline as Curtis dedicates his life into building this storm shelter.  He wants to protect his family and be prepared, but of course, with his mother being mentally ill, many wonder if Curtis is also ill.<br /><br />But it's the way that \\"Take Shelter\\" ends that makes this film so satisfying and unforgettable.<br /><br />As for the DVD release, you do get a pretty in-depth audio commentary by Jeff Nichols and Michael Shannon and also a few features such as deleted scenes, a featurette featuring behind-the-scenes interviews with the writer/director and cast members plus a Q&A between Michael Shannon & Shea Whigham.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Take Shelter\\" is an impressive film from Jeff Nichols and I would not be surprised if we start to see and hear more from this talented writer and filmmaker.  Unfortunately, the film was snubbed for any Academy Award nominations considering the number of awards it had won internationally, but still, \\"Take Shelter\\" is a fantastic film with a engrossing story with powerful performances.<br /><br />\\"Take Shelter\\" is recommended!is daughter and needless to say, he starts to act on them.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|YYYYYYEEEESSSSSS!!!!! I have been waiting 4 them to make one FOREVER!!! Its cool, fun and awesome! What's even better.... there's a free version. You should really get it!
B002BWP49C|5.0|This is an excellent movie. A must have for any vampire finatic. Very good for the money. You should really read the books first.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The only thing I dislike about this product is at the start of every new game an advertisement pops up that I need to tap \\"skip\\" to return to the game.  While it's not enough for me to remove the game, in my opinion it's annoying.
B005PR2FD8|4.0|Ah, those days in college, playing \\"Tekken\\" on the PSX until my thumbs would be in pain and thinking that the game was the best fighting game on the planet!<br /><br />But I know I'm not alone when it comes to being one of the many fans who grew up playing and still are playing \\"Tekken\\".<br /><br />The Bandai video game series which began in 1994 has always pushed the limit in fighting video games and we have seen six incarnation of the game for the major consoles, a Sony PSP version of the game as well as a \\"Tekken Tag\\" version.<br /><br />And one thing that \\"Tekken\\" had always done so well was seeing Namco trying to make an awesome looking 3D game, giving its characters their own fighting style and gameplay that rivaled other fighting game competitors, including CAPCOM's \\"Street Fighter\\" fighting game series (a rivalry that will lead to the upcoming \\"Tekken x Street Fighter\\"/\\"Street Fighter vs. Tekken\\" videogames).<br /><br />But you have to give credit to Bandai for crafting a continuing storyline that revolved around the ruthlessness of the Mishima family which include the evil and dead (but manages to always come back alive) patriarch Heihachi; Kazuya, Heihachi's evil son with the devil gene who will do anything to destroy his father and Kazuya's son Jin, who also has the devil gene (but chooses to use his power to destroy his grandfather and his father).<br /><br />Sure it sounds and reads quite wickedly and if you played the game, you can't deny of how this family is the ultimate in dysfunctional relationships.  Who can ever forget Kazuya Misushima grabbing his father and dropping him down a cliff?  Wicked, I tell you.<br /><br />But if there was one thing that \\"Tekken\\" has not lived up to its video game series is its video releases.<br /><br />The video games had cool stories but with each game, each character had a CG-storyline that lasted for a few minutes and fans wanted more!  Especially with \\"Street Fighter\\", \\"Virtua Fighter\\" and \\"Final Fight\\" receiving some anime love, \\"Tekken\\" would receive some love in 1998 as anime fans were treated with a lackluster animated film titled \\"Tekken: The Motion Picture\\", followed by a 2010 live-action film titled \\"Tekken\\" which even \\"Tekken\\" video game director Katsuhiro Harada had panned.  With a poorly done animated and live-action film, fans can only wish these two never existed.<br /><br />Fortunately, Bandai Entertainment had always wanted to create a CG-based animated film since the release of \\"Tekken 6' (for the PS3 and XBOX 360) and what they created was the CG animated-film titled \\"Tekken: Blood Vengeance\\", a storyline that actually will appeal to those who are familiar with the video game series.<br /><br />The film was supervised by Youichi Mori (\\"Appleseed\\") and written by Dai Sato (\\"Eureka Seven\\", \\"Cowboy Bebop\\", \\"Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex\\").  In charge of animation production is Digital Frontier who created the sequences for \\"Tekken\\" 5 and 6.<br /><br />And possibly the smartest decision made by Dai Sato was to not include every character in the \\"Tekken\\" universe but to focus on the characters that relate to the Mishima storyline: Heihachi, Kazuya, Jin  and Lin Xiaoyu.  And characters with storylines that have continued since the first video game: Spy Nina Williams and her enemy and sister, Anna but also the addition of the latest character, Alisa Bosconovitch (a robot created by Dr. Bosconovitch who has played a big part in the series storyline and his relation to other characters in the videogame).<br /><br />\\"Tekken: Blood Vengeance\\" will be released in the U.S. on DVD on November 22nd.  For those who want the Blu-ray release, will want to purchase \\"Tekken Hybrid\\" which contains the 3D Blu-ray version of the film, plus \\"Tekken Tag Tournament HD\\" and \\"Tekken Tag Tournament 2: Prequel\\" and was released on December 27, 2011.<br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Tekken: Blood Vengeance\\" is presented in 16:9 and is in Japanese and English Dolby Digital 5.1.  For an action film, as expected with this explosive storyline, you can expect a good round of explosions and destruction galore with the soundtrack.  And the picture quality is what one can expect on DVD.<br /><br />While the CG looks fantastic and in par with the graphics of the \\"Tekken 6' cut scenes, for those who are wanting to watch this in HD will have to purchase the PS3 \\"Tekken Hybrid\\" which contains the upcoming game \\"Tekken Tag Tournament 2: Prologue\\", \\"Tekken Tag Tournament HD\\" and \\"Tekken: Blood Vengeance 3D\\".<br /><br />In fact, this film looks amazing enough that I would prefer to watch it in HD versus on DVD, especially since you get both \\"Tekken Tag Tournaments\\" for the PS3.<br /><br />But for the DVD release, picture quality is good and as for the Japanese and English dub, I prefer the Japanese soundtrack as it syncs much better with the characters mouths.  But for those who prefer English, you do have the English dub as an option.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Tekken Blood Vengeance\\" comes with the film trailer and the trailer for the \\"Tekken Hybrid\\" PS3 release.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"Tekken: Blood Vengeance\\" is a film that definitely brings the storyline to the video game fans who have grown up with this series.  As the anime movie and the live-action film were made to be more accessible to those not familiar with the video games, I would imagine that \\"Tekken: Blood Vengeance\\" can be watched by someone not familiar with the series but at the same time, not feeling the impact compared to those who are familiar with the Mizushima families dysfunctional relationship.<br /><br />As a fan of \\"Tekken\\", I can easily recommend this to fans because the storyline literally relates to the video games.  You can't help but be excited when you see Nina vs. Anna, Lin Xiaoyu vs. Alisa and of course, seeing Kazuya and Jin going against each other.  And there are also a few other short cameo appearances by a few other characters as well.<br /><br />So, in terms of watching a film based on a video game, graphic-wise, I enjoyed this film as much as I enjoyed \\"Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children\\".  Mainly because I invested so much time in playing those games, you can't help but be excited.<br /><br />The storyline is easy to follow when it comes to Lin Xiaoyu but when it comes to the Mishima family, I know there are viewers not familiar with the video games who will feel they are missing a chunk of storyline because they don't know the hatred between Jin and his father Kazuya and both towards their grandfather Heihachi.<br /><br />And this is possibly one part of the release that  can be problematic for some.  For the release of \\"Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children\\", to help viewers understand what had taken place beforehand, many of the CG animatics from the video game were included as a special feature and served as a wonderful primer to help people understand the film.<br /><br />It would have been nice of Namco to include those CG clips as special features from the previously released video games, especially the cut-scenes regarding Heihachi, Kazuya and Jin.  So, I felt that was one missed opportunity for this DVD release (Note: I am not sure if the Blu-ray release will contain extra features not included on the DVD version), as it would definitely help non-fans or new fans understand what is going on and possibly get them interested in the video game series.<br /><br />But for those who are fans of the video game series, I can personally say that the film was exciting and fun to watch.  Granted, if you are not fans of the Mishima clan, Nina Williams or Lin Xiaoyu, I can understand how those fans would be a bit bummed that there favorite characters were not fully featured.<br /><br />But considering how I wished the video game cut-scenes were longer, to have 92 minutes of all story featuring these cool characters from \\"Tekken\\", I can't help but having this grin on my face because I enjoyed watching it.<br /><br />And while the PQ and AQ were good for DVD,  I wish there were more special features on the DVD but who knows?  Perhaps the Blu-ray release may have extra features.  And the fact that the PS3 \\"Tekken Hybrid\\" release comes with the 3D version of the film and two \\"Tekken Tag Tournament\\" video games in HD, I wouldn't be surprised if the hardcore fans go for the Blu-ray release.  I definitely would!<br /><br />Overall, \\"Tekken: Blood Vengeance\\" may not be for everyone as it is truly geared towards fans of the \\"Tekken\\" video game series, but if you are a fan, I definitely recommend watching the film!/><br />So, in terms of watching a film based on a video game, graphic-wise, I enjoyed this film as much as I enjoyed \\"Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children\\".

B003Y5H5AG|4.0|Back in the late '50s, Belgian cartoonist Peyo created the comic strips featuring small blue fictional characters known as the Smurfs.  A big success in France, the Smurfs would receive various adaptations.<br /><br />The first were in Belgium via TV animated shorts that were  created in 1961-1967, a few of the shorts would be featured in the 1965 in the black-and-white animation \\"Les Adventures des Schtroumpfs\\" and then followed by a 1976 animation titled \\"La Flûte &agrave; six schtroumpfs\\" (The Smurfs and the Magic Flute) which would receive an English version that would inspire more full-length Smurf animated films.<br /><br />But in America, where the Smurfs gained its popularity is through the 1981 animated TV series which was nominated many times for a Daytime Emmy Award and won the \\"Outstanding Children's Entertainment Series\\" for 1982-1983.  The animated series would broadcast on television through 1989.<br /><br />In 1997, producer Jordan Kerner has been trying to get a \\"Smurfs\\" film created but it wasn't until 2002 when Peyo's heirs accepted Kerner's offer and people were able to get their first look at the film via leaked footage on the Internet in 2008.<br /><br />And in 2011, the first live-action/CG Smurf film of a planned trilogy was released in theaters in 2011.  The film which was budgeted for $110 million received lackadaisical reviews from film critics but the film was popular among the younger viewers and earned over $559 million in the box office ensuring the film as a success for Columbia Pictures. It also helps that the film features all-star talent for the live-action scenes and the voice acting scenes including Neil Patrick Harris (\\"How I Met Your Mother\\"), Jayma Mays (\\"Glee), Hank Azaria (\\"The Simpsons\\"), Sofia Vergara (\\"Modern Family\\") and Tim Gunn (\\"Project Runaway\\").  For the voices of the Smurfs, a few of the talent featured are George Lopez, Katy Perry, Alan Cummings, Kenan Thompson, Fred Armisen, Paul Reubens to name a few.  And the film is directed by Raja Gosnell (\\"Big Momma's Hosue\\", \\"Scooby-Doo\\", \\"Never Been Kissed\\") and a screenplay by J. David Stern (\\"Shrek 2', \\"The Rugrats Movie\\"), David N. Weiss (\\"Shrek 2', \\"All Dogs Go to Heaven\\") and writing duo Jay Scherick and David Ronn (both wrote \\"Zookeeper\\", \\"Guess Who\\", \\"Norbit\\").<br /><br />And now, \\"The Smurfs\\" will be released on Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray and DVD on December 2nd.<br /><br />VIDEO AND AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"The Smurfs\\" is presented in 1:78:1 Anamorphic widescreen and English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital (and English-Audio Description Track).  If you want the best presentation of \\"The Smurfs\\", you definitely want to go for the Blu-ray release, especially the Blu-ray 3D release if you have a Blu-ray player and television set capable of 3D playback.  But for the DVD version, you can still see quite a bit of detail from the threaded caps that the Smurfs wear, the strands of hair on Smurfette's head to the pigmentation on the blue skin of the Smurfs.  Possibly not as detailed as the Blu-ray version but still visible on DVD.  For the most part, on DVD, the picture quality is very good.<br /><br />As for audio, the audio features a lot of dialogue, music and also special effects for the action sequences.  On Blu-ray, the lossless audio will definitely take advantage of the surround channels but on DVD, the 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack is also pretty good as there is good amount of LFE during the bass-driven sequences, the music - may it be the Smurfs singing or even Neil and the Smurfs playing \\"Guitar Hero Aerosmith\\".  The Dolby Digital soundtrack sounds very good but on Blu-ray, you definitely want to go for that version if you want a more immersive soundtrack and to hear the ambiance much more clearly.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"The Smurfs\\" come with the following special features:<br /><br />  Find the Smurfs Game - Featuring a hide-and-seek remotecontrol game in which you are shown a Smurf and with other Smurfs in the village, you need to find out where a certain smurf is hiding.<br />  Audio Commentary 1 - The first audio commentary features director Raja Gosnell who talks about the challenges of bringing the Smurfs to CG, the shooting process, scouting and shooting on location.<br />  Audio Commentary 2 - The second audio commentary features producer Jordan Kerner, writer J. David Stern, David N. Weiss , Jay Scherek, David Ronn and VFX Supervisor Richard Hoover.<br />  The Smurfs: Comic Book to the Big Screen - (8:16) Featuring the challenges in taking the Smurfs for a CG film, creating different personalities for each Smurf and more.<br />  Going Gargamel - (10:01) Hank Azaria talks about playing Gargamel and we see how much time it took to make the actor into Gargamel and behind-the-scenes footage and also the challenges of playing the role.<br />  Blu-Pers - (:26) Two very short bloopers.<br />  Happy Music Montage - (1:51) Short music montage of clips from the movie.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I was a bit skeptical when I first saw the trailer for \\"The Smurfs\\" in the theater.  It's been a long time since I have watched the cartoon on television but I was a big fan of the animated series and owned several of the toys when I was younger.<br /><br />And while the animated series is dear to me because I watched it from grade school and even when I was in high school, here we are decades later and now I have a child in grade school, who has become interested in \\"The Smurfs\\" not so much because of the animated series (which he has never seen) but primarily because he enjoys the iPad video game.<br /><br />So, it's quite interesting how the younger generation have found about the Smurfs, may it be the video game or through the Happy Meal toys but needless to say, despite the big names attached to this live-action/CG film, my main interest is how much they writers strayed from the original storyline or in this case, from the cartoon.<br /><br />And when it was all done, I can say that as a family film and a film for the children, it was a fun film!  My eight-year-old enjoyed it a lot and for me and the wife, I'm a bit more easy on family films especially \\"The Smurfs\\" because they are targeted for a younger demographic.  With that being said, my wife was turned off by the \\"Guitar Hero\\" scene and I admit, that was possibly the cheesiest part of the entire film.<br /><br />But for me, there was a lot to love about the film.  First, I think it worked in the favor of producer Jordan Kerner that this film was made in 2011 versus 1997 or in the early 2000's because CG has developed a lot in the last decade and for the most part, I found the computer graphics to be very well-done.  Loved the detail on the skin of the Smurfs, loved the detail on the knit caps to the thorough planning on the color of the Smurfs to creating living beings via CG on the film (the special feature goes into details about how much the crew wanted the characters to come alive).<br /><br />It helps to have popular TV talent such as Neil Patrick Harris, Sofia Vergara and Jayma Mays also involved with the film, especially the talent of Hank Azaria who is spectacular as voice talent for \\"The Simpsons\\" (and also the '90s \\"Spider-Man\\" animated series) but even before then, he was fun to watch on \\"Mad About You\\" and \\"Friends\\".  He did a fantastic job as Gargamel.  And of course, you have a lot of voice talent involved in this film from singer Katy Perry to a long list of talent which include Jonathan Winters, Alan Cummings, Fred Armisen, George Lopez, Kenan Thompson, Jeff Foxworthy, Wolfgang Puck to name a few.  And heck, you have voice acting legend Frank Welker (who also did the voice dub in the earlier Smurf's animated films and TV series as \\"Hefty Smurf\\") doing the voice of Azrael.<br /><br />So, I appreciate the dedication of the crew honoring the original animated series and comic books but also giving new life to the characters for this live action/CG film.<br /><br />With that being said, I know a major criticism by reviewers was that this film was \\"too kiddy\\" especially since it's a rated PG film, not rated G.  But for me, \\"The Smurfs\\" was originally conceived for children back in the late '50s, was targeted towards kids in the '80s and I never expected anything dark or low-beat for this film.  I was not expecting the writers to stray far off from the original storyline and expected a family film that would feature a lot of laughs and also cheesy moments (I sort of liken it to the live-action/CG animated \\"Alvin and the Chipmunks\\" films).<br /><br />Sure, Neil Patrick Harris and the Smurfs rockin' it to Aerosmith via \\"Guitar Hero\\" was possibly the lowest point of this film for me, but aside from those scenes...everything else was pretty fun and hilarious and for the most part, my son and I had fun watching it (although my wife wasn't into the film all that much).<br /><br />As for the DVD release, the DVD release features a good amount of special features and commentary and the DVD does look good.  But if you want the best presentation in sound and audio, you want to go for the Blu-ray release, especially since it contains more special features than the DVD release.<br /><br />Overall, for those who grew up watching \\"The Smurfs\\", the good news is that the writers did fans a service by not straying to far from the original concept.  Sure, there are some cheesy scenes but as a family film, I'm not going to be overly critical as this film was created for the kids.  And as a fan of the original animated TV series, I had a fun time watching it as well.<br /><br />With the holidays coming up, if you are looking for a fun family film to keep the kids busy during Winter vacation or even during those long traveling commutes, I recommend give \\"The Smurfs\\" a try!this case, from the cartoon.<br /><br />And when it was all done, I can say that as a family film and a film for the children, it was a fun film!  My eight-year-old enjoyed it a lot and for me and the wife, I'm a bit more easy on family films especially \\"The Smurfs\\" because they are targeted for a younger demographic.

And heck, you have voice acting legend Frank Welker (who also did the voice dub in the earlier Smurf's animated films and TV series as \\"Hefty Smurf\\") doing the voice of Azrael.<br /><br />So, I appreciate the dedication of the crew honoring the original animated series and comic books but also giving new life to the characters for this live action/CG film.<br /><br />With that being said, I know a major criticism by reviewers was that this film was \\"too kiddy\\" especially since it's a rated PG film, not rated G.  But for me, \\"The Smurfs\\" was originally conceived for children back in the late '50s, was targeted towards kids in the '80s and I never expected anything dark or low-beat for this film.  I was not expecting the writers to stray far off from the original storyline and expected a family film that would feature a lot of laughs and also cheesy moments (I sort of liken it to the live-action/CG animated \\"Alvin and the Chipmunks\\" films).<br /><br />Sure, Neil Patrick Harris and the Smurfs rockin' it to Aerosmith via \\"Guitar Hero\\" was possibly the lowest point of this film for me, but aside from those scenes...everything else was pretty fun and hilarious and for the most part, my son and I had fun watching it (although my wife wasn't into the film all that much).<br /><br />As for the DVD release, the DVD release features a good amount of special features and commentary and the DVD does look good.  But if you want the best presentation in sound and audio, you want to go for the Blu-ray release, especially since it contains more special features than the DVD release.<br /><br />Overall, for those who grew up watching \\"The Smurfs\\", the good news is that the writers did fans a service by not straying to far from the original concept.  Sure, there are some cheesy scenes but as a family film, I'm not going to be overly critical as this film was created for the kids.  And as a fan of the original animated TV series, I had a fun time watching it as well.<br /><br />With the holidays coming up, if you are looking for a fun family film to keep the kids busy during Winter vacation or even during those long traveling commutes, I recommend give \\"The Smurfs\\" a try!

The drama series is quite slick as it gives you the feel of New York and like many abc studios related DVD releases, Disney has always done a good job with their TV show transfers. A show that balances outdoor and indoor shots with good lighting, the picture quality for \\"CASTLE\\" is pretty solid. I didn't see any major artifacting issues or low level noise that was distracting.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />As for the audio, \\"Castle - The Complete Third Season\\" is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The series is front and center channel driven with a few episodes (that involve gun fights) utilizing the surround channels. The series does utilize quite a bit of music and for the most, the series is clear and understandable.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Castle - The Complete Third Season\\" includes the following special features:<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />  Audio Commentary - Episode 301 'A Deadly Affair' With Creator/Executive Producer/Writer Andrew W.

And I don't blame them.<br /><br />Back in the 1980's, when ABC had the hit investigative series \\"Moonlighting\\" with Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd.  The writers kept these two apart for so long despite the chemistry and sexual tension of the characters and once they got together, it was the final nail in the coffin for the series and from that moment on, the two as a pair brought the downfall of the series.<br /><br />So, sometimes its not a good thing to push relationships but the writers have done a great job of holding things off and building that chemistry.

Or to continue this built-up sexual tension for between these characters for another season.<br /><br />But the season finale makes you wonder how things will be in season four between these two.<br /><br />Now, possibly the best thing going for season three is the fact that we learn that the murder of Detective Beckett's mother is much bigger than she can ever realize.  In fact, as a viewer, I was even surprised to see how deep this storyline has gotten and I do like how things have gotten progressively bigger each season with this storyline and in this case, possibly quite tragic.  OK, probably not as there is no way Castle is going to die but...Beckett?  Would the writers go that far?  All I can say is that the season finale left me speechless.  Wow!<br /><br />And last, if there is one thing that \\"Castle\\" writers have been great, that is giving viewers one hell of a season finale.  And to find out one of the characters of the series has a major secret, suffice to say, I never saw that one coming.  And definitely will have ramifications going into season four.<br /><br />As for the DVD, \\"Castle - The Complete Third Season\\" is once again, another solid release.  Like the previous two DVD box sets, this third season also has a good number of special features including an intriguing roundtable discussion, two audio commentary, a featurette about shooting in Hollywood, outtakes, deleted scenes and a music video.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Castle - The Complete Third Season\\" features another fun humorous, exciting and explosive season and the writers really stepped up their game with a good balance of plot twists, sexual tension and drama.<br /><br />Definitely recommended!ason of \\"Castle\\".<br />  Deleted Scenes - Featuring three deleted scenes: Message from Royce, Honorary Badge and Out of Line.<br />  Murder Boards - (3:23) Rob Schow talks about the dry erase boards shown on the series  and how much planning goes into the boards and how they are utilized in the series.<br />  Get on the Floor - Music Video -  (2:15) The music video feat. \\"Get on the Floor\\" (Note: The song does have some mature lyrics that you may not want to play around children).<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Castle - The Complete Third Season\\" comes with a slip cover case.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Finally, after watching three seasons of wondering if Castle and Beckett will ever get together, perhaps longtime viewers have a glimmer of hope for the fourth season.<br /><br />For so long, after seeing Beckett and Castle together and having this chemistry but none of them willing to cross the line beyond their professional working relationship, season three of \\"Castle\\" really takes things up a notch by showing the viewers that perhaps these two would be good together.<br /><br />Granted, like the previous two seasons, the writers are not going to easily make that happen.

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|In 2011, Woody Allen would write and direct the film \\"Midnight in Paris\\", a romantic comedy/fantasy which has been praised as Woody Allen's best film in the last decade.<br /><br />In fact, \\"Midnight in Paris\\" is Woody Allen's highest grossing film which has earned over $135 million in the box office.<br /><br />The film features an all-star cast starring Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Carla Bruni, Kathy Bates, Marion Cotillard, Adrien Brody, Michael Sheen to name a few.<br /><br />For Allen, the film is a return to fantasy such as his 1985 film \\"The Purple Rose of Cairo\\" and the screenplay was written around the title of the film \\"Midnight in Paris\\" and his goal was to capture Paris, focus on the romantic elements of the film and its warm ambience.  The film would mark Allen's first film to go through a digital intermediate and literally an experiment to find out if he would like to use the process in his next films.<br /><br />\\"Midnight in Paris\\" is a film that focuses on Gil (played by Owen Wilson, \\"Wedding Crashers\\", \\"The Darjeeling Limited\\", \\"Bottle Rocket\\"), a Hollywood screenwriter who has traveled with his fiancee, Inez (played by Rachel McAdams, \\"Wedding Crashers\\", \\"Mean Girls\\", \\"Sherlock Holmes\\") and her wealthy and conservative parents to Paris.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Midnight in Paris\\" is presented in 1:85:1 Anamorphic Widescreen and presented in English and French 3.0 LCR (Discrete Surround). Woody Allen's goal to capture the beauty of Paris was successful!  Darius Khondji and Johanne Debas did a fantastic job in capturing these breathtaking scenes of the Parisian streets, various locations and for the most part, everything looks good on DVD.<br /><br />But if anyone wants to experience the best picture and audio quality, you definitely want to watch this movie on Blu-ray!  In fact, while I was watching this film on DVD, I kept telling myself of how beautiful those scenes would look in HD!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Midnight in Paris\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Midnight in Cannes - (4:57) Featuring excerpts of the Cannes Film Festival press conference as Woody Allen and cast talk about filming in Paris and working on the film.<br />  Theatrical Trailer - (2:05) The original theatrical trailer for \\"Midnight in Paris\\".<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Delightful, clever and witty... Woody Allen serves up a wonderful romantic comedy with \\"Midnight in Paris\\" and yet another fantastic  film to add to his amazing oeuvre.<br /><br />When it comes to Woody Allen, you just never know what you're going to get with his films, especially within the last 20-years.  Many film critics have wondered if the filmmaker has lost his magic that he exhibited earlier in his career but I have always watched his films, past and present and have enjoyed them.  Sure, the older films have a style, an allure, to them that emits \\"classic\\" Woody Allen filmmaking and one that many have hoped to see again.<br /><br />With \\"Midnight in Paris\\", although Allen doesn't star in the film, fortunately Owen Wilson manages to tap into a Woody persona and are able to achieve an efficacy of Woody Allen magic.  Romantic, witty and absolute charming, \\"Midnight in Paris\\" is a film that captivated me from beginning to end and it was a film that I enjoyed tremendously.<br /><br />When it comes to capturing romance in the city, may it be bleak or happy, may it be in New York, London or Barcelona, how perfect would it be for Allen to capture a romantic comedy in Paris?<br /><br />And he does it with \\"Midnight in Paris\\".  From its opening breathtaking scenes of the famous areas of the city, I was captivated from the start.<br /><br />But its the characters that made me love this movie and it's also the clever insight to those characters that I found delightful.  Owen Wilson does a remarkable job of playing Gil, the writer seeking inspiration but its that creative desire that he gets from Paris that gives him vitality.  Vitality that runs counter to the lost energy he gets when he's around his fiance Inez.<br /><br />Inez plays the soul sucking fiance.  Not so supportive of her fiance, despite having knowledge of art, poetry and literary work, she would rather listen to her friend Paul, a wannabe verite that is pompous and your typical Mr. Know-it-All, or more like he thinks he knows it all.<br /><br />But it's when we see the fantasy element of Woody Allen's film start to take shape, of how we see the creative Gil finding inspiration by returning to what he thinks is the Golden Year of creativity, the 1920's.  The time of the Lost Generation and for anyone who are avid readers, those who follow poetry, art and cinema...one can easily ask themselves, how would it have been to have an association, friendship with the talents of Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Luis Bunuel, Cole Porter, Gertrude Stein, etc.<br /><br />To use the words of Ernest Hemingway from his memoir \\"A Moveable Feast\\", \\"If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast\\".<br /><br />What would one do if you had the chance to go back in time, France ala 1920's and to associate with these individuals?<br /><br />This is where \\"Midnight in Paris\\" becomes charming and fun, and as I watched, I watched with a big grin because we see the character of Gil, the classic Woody Allen character, getting that opportunity. There is no focus on how Gil is able to go back in time, all that matters is that he is with people that understand him, people from a Lost Generation which he has looked at as \\"The Golden Years\\" for those individuals he had respected.<br /><br />And because of this,  the use of these famous figures and Gil's interaction with them may be pleasing to an audience or may go over their heads of why one would find certain situations funny or hilarious.<br /><br />While \\"Midnight in Paris\\" by no means does one have to be an erudite of their work to enjoy the film, it does make things a bit more intriguing if you do.  From the relationships between Hemingway and Gertrude Stein or Hemingway with the Fitzgerald's or Picasso's many mistresses, I loved how the film touched upon those little things.  But its not necessary to understand them.  For example, the woman that Gil starts to fall for...Adriana, is a fictional character.  A mistress of Picasso who loves couture, who is interested in Gil (as Gil has interest in her) but because he is engaged to Inez, how will his time with Adriana change him?<br /><br />As for little details that I found intriguing, you see Gil visiting the bookstore \\"Shakespeare & Company\\". The significance is that its a bookstore that Hemingway would visit and read various books that inspired him.<br /><br />One of the most hilarious parts of the film, which fans of filmmaker Luis Bunuel would be interested in, is a scene where Gil is offering a filmmaking idea.<br /><br />Gil:  Mr. Bunuel, I have a nice idea for a movie for you?<br /><br />Luis: Yes?<br /><br />Gil: A group of people attend a formal dinner party and at the dinner, when they try to leave the room, they can't.<br /><br />Luis: Why not?<br /><br />Gil: They just can't just seem to exit the door?<br /><br />Luis: But...But why?<br /><br />Gil: Well...Momento.  When they are forced to stay together, the veneer of civilization quickly fades away and what you are left with is... who they real are...animals.<br /><br />Luis: But I don't get it, why don't they just walk out of the room?<br /><br />Gil: All I am asking is for you to think about it.  Who knows, when you are shaving one day, it may tickle your fancy.<br /><br />Luis: I don't understand...what is holding them in the room?<br /><br />While possibly this discussion may go over the heads of most audiences, for cinema fans, one can only grin as Gil is talking about Bunuel's Academy Award winning surrealist film from 1972, \\"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\\".<br /><br />So, there are small details that I just found delightful and fun, and with the whole film shot in Paris and having that touristy but yet enchanting flair, I couldn't help but enjoy the beauty of the film and enjoy the film and see the journey of Gil and how Paris changes him.<br /><br />As for the DVD, I think \\"Midnight in Paris\\" actually breaks new ground.  I believe this is the first Woody Allen film to include a special feature.  It's generally known and mentioned in many other reviews that Woody Allen is not a big fan of special features and with each release, all you are getting is a trailer.  But with this DVD (and possibly for the Blu-ray release), you get a four minute special feature from the Cannes press conference for \\"Midnight in Paris\\".  Sure, it's short but take what you can get Woody Allen fans, the fact that there is a special feature aside from the trailer is actually surprising.<br /><br />While the DVD is a very solid release, if you have a Blu-ray player, this is one of those films that features beautiful scenery that you want to watch it on HD.  This is a very entertaining film that is worth watching on Blu-ray but otherwise, if you don't have a Blu-ray player and don't plan to get one, then the DVD is very good!<br /><br />Overall, \\"Midnight in Paris\\" is a fantastic Woody Allen film, especially those familiar with the famous figures presented in the film.

0307956350|2.0|I \\"read\\" the Audio version and do not recommend doing so - the way the author jumps from place to place and back and forth in time means confusion aplenty. Perhaps if I had been reading a printed version I could have paged back and forth to clarify. Maybe he (the author) thought he was using some sort of modern plotting technique, but to present future scenes and then drop back to the past and then to \\"today\\" left one's head whirling.<br /><br />The idea is interesting - a married, loving couple each with BIG secrets to hide. But the characters were flat and I didn't feel \\"engaged\\" with the woman, Kate, at all. She seemed unreal emotionally with her two boys as well. Perhaps it's a problem of a man writing \\"as a woman\\" for the novel?<br /><br />I love spy novels, the reviews made it seem as if it was right up my alley, but it simply fell off, I DID finish listening to it, thus the 2 stars.But, the ending came as a shock, I thought I was missing some of the audio recording. In fact, I'm going to find the book in a library in print and really look at the last 2 pages and make sure they weren't missing from my audio book!<br /><br />I know this is Pavone's first book, a big endeavor. But I am, as many of the other reviewers here are, confused about the high flying positive reviews for it.<br /><br />I think it needed a firm editor to organize it and reduce the volume of minute description by 1/4 at least, and improve the dialog as well.<br />He does do a better job describing food than people, I think.<br /><br />SusanD
B007CKNX28|5.0|This cd did not hit me like his others. First thing I noticed off this listen is jack's not doing what he did on other cd's but diving deeper into his music catalogue. The catchy choruses of \\"Many shades of black\\" or infectious bass of seven nation was not there.  What is there are the lyrics and storytelling for your ass and a musician weaving in old I mean old country time blues then current rock n' roll and folk songs done perfectly. Most of the songs on this cd somehow put me in the same mindframe of that song about the Milk man and the boy killing on Carolina Drama. Songs like Poor boy are catchy but some of the songs I actually love best are the ones without the catchy choruses (hypocritical kiss, i'm shakin).  Basically this is how he cd hit me.  1Missing pieces caught my ear as an uptempo rock n'roll song with a beat that seems a little bit off from catching itself but completely works the beat is very catchy but he's telling a great story that doesn't lend you to be able to sing with the chorus, but listen greatfully. Great song, liked it first listen and it had me thinking the whole album would move in this direction.  2Sixteen saltines is that hard fast garage rock (tone similar to fell in love with a girl). This song gives the album that punch and fast pace. 3Freedom at 21 is him singing in a rap-like tone that works because of the style of singing voice he uses. It helps to add diversity to the album since he uses a choppy singing voice for most of the cd. 4I'm sure everyone's heard love interruption. Great song. 5Blunderbuss is somewhat reminiscent of a Led Zepellin song that never was. Jack sings on this song and sings in a talking voice over a grand piano and violin. The melody is hypnotic and folksy. \\"doing what two people need is never on my menu,\\" that line is awkard but describes his attitude to me.  6Hypocritical kiss starts off like it's gonna be symphonic the way the piano introduces itself with a flushing of the keys it leads up to the epicness of a guy having an argument with his girl about why he's right and she's wrong. This is a song that is needed during a time when so many men want to sing apology songs about how men are wrong and stupid.  Love this song, it reminds me i'm a man and have the right to be right (haha). 7Weep themselves starts off with guitars, piano and drums that somehow make me feel like I'm in a western showdown.  Jack speaks of beating his girl up in the first line and talks bad about the guys who are suckers for love.  He's not really singing in this song, but like announcing in a singing tone things that are about men's feelings of the world and relationships. It's a song that takes a stand about the choice of how men decide to be a specific type of man and what they can expect for consequences. 8I'm shakin makes me feel like I'm trapped in rag time song in the 20's and 70's somehow as he describes how a woman makes him feel great and he's shakin from bad nerves. He likens his nervous wreck to leaves on a tree shaking but he's jumping from insecurity and likes it. This is an old time style of song and works for where the rest of the album goes. 9trash tongue is like a Little Richard song. God only knows when I heard someone sound like little richard (maybe Awol Nation) on that one song.  He's telling a song about some monkeys, he breaks into old time piano playing and tamborines. I think i even hear a banjo. This is like some old time Chuck Berry Rock n'roll stuff with Jack growling out blues singing on an rock song. I wanted to hear him scream on this one or have some more fun with it, but it seemed like he was trying to focus on making the song authentic.  10 this song starts off like i'm on a carousel but then leads it's way into being a ballad and then reveals itself to be a definite folk song with a banjo or very old guitar a simple piano playing and a catchy as hell chorus.  Jack sings and tells the story of a poor boy.  This song is an easy going, uptempo, fun song to me.  Some of the greatest love songs are the ones that don't praise love or speak of the good side. 11 this song is like an old gospel 1910 song with folk song lyrics. I hate to put it that far back but I listen to a lot of music and this is definitely Jack showing he can take a song from 1910 and somehow bring Queen remnants out then the original jack white somehow turning this into a lullabye. This song works on so many levels. I wish I was smoking, but that past is gone for me. I would like to know what he was smokin to go there with it though. 12on and on \\"sun and the moon never change, they just rearrange,\\" parables, philosophies sung in a tenor, a duet partially in harmony, a soft song crooning then changes to somewhat a mix of a jazz, psychadelic rock song. This song just starts to cement the continuity of listenability of the cd that lets you know that no song is going to make it so you don't feel the album. 13 is probably my favorite because of the very weird harmony he uses.  It's jazzy and psychadelic, sorry to say that again but it uses jazz keys and I don't even listen to jazz. it just is.  The only thing rock and roll about the song is Jack's singing in the end.This song is a sing-a-long song and makes you want to be on the road looking at cornfields and blue skies.  The end of the song breaks into a zepellin type rockin out to end the song of with probably one of the most pleasant unique falsettos and harmonies i've heard in a while. Perfect way to end of the cd. To summarize it all I wanted to hear Jack really showcase his vocal range and sing steady long notes and harmonies (like many shades of black) instead he used a choppy singing voice most of the time. I wanted to hear choruses from White Stripes Elephants that make you incapable of getting the song out your head. Instead he introduced me to what seems to be a very natural place for him musically, but new to my ear.  It took a lot of listening until I could hear and love what he was doing. He somehow updated the oldest blues, before Muddy Waters, and brought in himself Jack and 1960's 70's psycadelic era. He left out the 80's vibe completely that some of his other cd's gave to.  Eclectic cd that shows Jack is a musician that has influences but is so educated in music that he is creating, recreating and making style of completely his own.  So many of his songs do this that I just have to give him the credit for being one of the greatest musicians out there today. Great masterpiece classic.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|Stieg Larsson is known in Sweden for his contribution to sci-fi fandom but to the outside world, he is known posthumously for his \\"Millennium\\" trilogy especially with the novel \\"M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor (Men who hate women)\\" aka \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\", the first novel of the trilogy and a novel based on manuscripts by Larsson written  but unpublished until after his death in 2004.<br /><br />In 2008, Larsson became the second best-selling author in the world and the trilogy had sold 27 million copies in more than 40 countries.<br /><br />In 2009, the film received its Swedish adaptation and the film which was created for $13 million would go on to earn $102 million worldwide and with the success of the novels and the Swedish film, it was no surprise that Hollywood would come knocking and create an English version of the popular storyline.<br /><br />The 2011 version of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" was directed by award-winning director David Fincher (\\"Fight Club\\", \\"Se7en\\", \\"The Social Network\\", \\"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\\") with a screenplay by veteran writer Steven Zaillian (\\"Schindler's List\\", \\"American Gangster\\", \\"Gangs of New York\\").<br /><br />The film would feature the cinematography of Jeff Cronenweth (\\"Fight Club\\", \\"The Social Network\\", \\"One Hour Photo\\") and music by Trent Reznor (\\"The Social Network, \\"Se7en\\", \\"Lost Highway\\") and Atticus Ross (\\"The Social Network, \\"Twilight\\", \\"Limitless\\").<br /><br />Starring in the film are Daniel Craig (\\"Casino Royale\\", \\"Quantum of Solace\\", \\"Cowboys & Aliens\\"), Rooney Mara (\\"The Social Network\\", \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\", \\"Youth in Revolt\\"), Christopher Plumber (\\"A Beautiful Mind\\", \\"The Sound of Music\\", \\"Beginners\\"), Stellan Skarsgard (\\"Good Will Hunting\\", \\"Thor\\", \\"Mamma Mia\\") and Robin Wright (\\"Beowulf\\", \\"Unbreakable\\", \\"Moneyball\\").<br /><br />The film was quite successful in the box office earning over $229 million and also winning and being nominated for a plethora of awards worldwide.  Including an Academy Award for \\"Best Film Editing\\" (Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter).<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is presented in 2:40:1 anamorphic widescreen and presented in English and French 5.1 Dolby Digital and English Dolby Surround plus an English audio descriptive track.  It's important to note that \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" will be released on Blu-ray and this is one of those films that are shot in a variety of locations, beautiful cinematography that would look absolutely fantastic on Blu!<br /><br />I didn't notice any compression artifacts or any major PQ problems.  Personally, I was impressed by the cinematography that I actually am looking forward in picking this film up on Blu-ray and watching it via HD.  It's a stunning film that the David Fincher and David Cronenweth really did a wonderful job in bringing Stieg Larsson's novel to life.<br /><br />As for audio, once again, this is where audiophiles would opt for Blu-ray for its lossless soundtrack.  On DVD, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's music sounds clear and there are moments of action scenes such as a rifle shot and explosion, but it's a film where ambiance plays a big role in the film and what you hear the most through the surround channels.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" comes with the following special feature:<br /><br />  Commentary by Director David Fincher - Featuring an in-depth audio commentary by director David Fincher.  From discussions of the cast, the characters, locations, stunts and overall making of the film.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />My first foray into \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" came from my wife.  Her family members have loved the novels and my wife was going crazy reading all three novels and then watching the film.  She has told me many times to read the novels in the trilogy but with so many books in myreading queue, I figured, why not see what the hype is all about and watch this film for myself.<br /><br />When I watched the Swedish version of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\", I was drawn in by the performances of Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace.  Their performance was magnificent, as was the cinematography by Jens Fishcer and Eric Kress.  Just the amount of footage shot in various weather conditions and locations was quite impressive but most of all, bringing the novel to life (as my wife would say).<br /><br />I also knew there would be a David Fincher version of the film but I was skeptical at first because I enjoyed the Swedish version so much.  When it was revealed that veteran Steven Zaillian would be writing the screenplay version and that Daniel Craig was hired to play Mikael Blomkvist, I figured, let's see how things go.<br /><br />Similar to the Swedish version of the film, I absolutely enjoyed Fincher's version of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\".<br /><br />This film was not only suspenseful but it literally sent chills down my spine.  The film is not for the weak at heart when it comes to violence and torture.  The film has many graphic moments of people who have been murdered, people who have been raped and I'm not going to sugarcoat things... this film is violent.<br /><br />But the film is also a suspenseful, haunting thriller that not only grabs your attention, you literally root for these characters that are completely opposite but they take you on an amazing ride with quite a bit of twists and turns along the way.  I have no problems saying that \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is one of the best modern suspense films that I have watched in long while.  And I'm talking about overall acting, cinematography, pacing and how well the story is conceived.  It's a fantastic film!<br /><br />Personally, these characters are what I loved about the film.  The character of Mikael Blomkvist is an experienced writer who is taking on a billionaire and now having to face a serious libel charge that he libeled him due to false information he was given.  While I was skeptical of Daniel Craig at first, he managed to do a fantastic job playing the character. But the character I was the most skeptical is Lisbeth.  Noomi Rapace was fantastic and when I saw pictures of Rooney Mara prior to her playing Lisbeth, I was not sure how this would play out, but she instantly transformed herself into a new breed of Lisbeth.  Different from Rapace's version but still effective.  As for the character of Lisbeth Salander,  to see her as an anti-social, goth-like computer hacker brought another dimension to this film.<br /><br />But what works is the slight changes that were made to this 2011 American version of the film from the original Swedish version of the film.  The American version actually incorporates more of the book to its storyline than the Swedish version.  For one, Blomkvist is not a character that has to be worried of going to prison.  This impacts Blomkvist in the Swedish version of the film, in the American version, he does not have to worry about prison time at all.<br /><br />Another major difference is that the book focused more on the relationship between Mikael's Millennium Magazine partner Erika Berger and this is more evident in the American version.  Also, in the book, Mikael's daughter had importance and in the Swedish version, she was barely mentioned. In the U.S. version, Mikael's daughter is a major key to the discovery of deciphering the code made by Harriet.<br /><br />There are also quite a bit of differences involving Lisbeth Salander, such as the Swedish version has her mugged by a gang of men, not the case of the US version.  Also, the introduction between Mikael and Lisbeth are very different between the two films.  But most importantly, the relationship of both Mikael having to work with Lisbeth and how it affects the characters to the final scene of the film.  Which I actually enjoyed from the American version over the Swedish version of the film.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the Swedish version a lot, in many ways I also enjoyed the American version even more.  Mainly for its attention to details from the book that was incorporated into the film, although I enjoyed Noomi Rapace's version of Lisbeth Salander even more, Rooney Mara's version actually works much better.  But I do enjoy both films a lot, it's just that the 2011 version, they were able to incorporate more of the book and tweak the storyline a bit more.<br /><br />I suppose it's a bit more subjective to the viewer familiar with the Swedish film and the book but if I wished there was two things that weren't changed in the American version, it would revolve around Blomkvist's problems with prison time and a scene revolving Lisbeth and the assailant, which I enjoyed from the Swedish version even more.<br /><br />If there was one subject that I feel may touch a nerve with viewers is a rape scene (well, actually there are others who have been raped and tortured) but there is one graphic scene that may turn people off.  I for one, dislike disturbing scenes like this in a film especially if was done for shock value.  In the case of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\", although a film that contains a lot of violence, I felt that the violence was not gratuitous and was appropriate to the story but again, this is subjective as I've read those who felt it was appropriate and others who felt it was bit too much for their taste.<br /><br />As for the DVD, the DVD doesn't come with a lot of special features but an audio commentary by David Fincher.  As mentioned, if you want the best version of the films, go for the HD release as I'm sure the film will look and sound incredible on Blu-ray.  A movie this good, demands to be seen on Blu!<br /><br />\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is a fantastic film featuring an awesome performance by the talent, a chilling screenplay adaptation and wonderful cinematography and music.  It's a film that will no doubt send shivers towards your spine but you will feel that you are captured by the film by the solid performances courtesy of Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara.  These two were absolutely wonderful and felt that Steven Zaillian and David Fincher did a magnificent job in including more of the book to this adaptation of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\".  And I can only hope the two work together again for the second film and see if they can fix some of the problems that the Swedish version of the film was criticized for.<br /><br />Overall, I absolutely loved this film and if you have not watched this film yet, I absolutely recommend one putting this on their must-buy list for 2012.<br /><br />\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is highly recommended!aving to face a serious libel charge that he libeled him due to false information he was given.

B006QVRVJK|4.0|Roman Polanski's \\"Carnage\\" is hilarious, comedic chaos at its very best!  A wonderful performance by Jodie Foster, Kate Winslet, Christoph Waltz and John C. Reilly.<br /><br />In France, Yasmina Reza's 2006 successful play \\"Le Dieu du carnage\\" (God of Carnage) is widely acclaimed.  Having received multiple awards and productions all over the world, the play received its film adaptation in 2011 courtesy of Roman Polanski (\\"The Pianist\\", \\"Rosemary's Baby\\", \\"Chinatown\\").<br /><br />The film stars  Jodie Foster (\\"The Silence of the Lambs\\", \\"Panic Room\\", \\"Contact\\"), Kate Winslet (\\"Titanic\\", \\"Revolutionary Road\\", \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\"), Christoph Waltz (\\"Inglorious Basterds\\", \\"The Green Hornet\\", \\"Water for Elephants\\") and  John C. Reilly (\\"Magnolia\\", \\"Boogie Nights\\", \\"The Aviator\\", \\"Step Brothers\\").<br /><br />The film would earn a Golden Globe nomination for \\"Best Actress\\" for Jodie Foster and Kate Winslet, including a Cesar Award nomination for \\"Best Writing - Adaptation\\" for Roman Polanski and Yasmina Reza.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Carnage\\" is presented in 2:35:1 anamorphic widescreen and audio in English, French 5.0 Dolby Digital.  Before I go on, it's important to note that this film will be released on Blu-ray, so if you want the best picture and audio quality, I recommend watching it on HD.<br /><br />With that being said, \\"Carnage\\" is a film that takes place entirely in a set featuring a living room, bathroom, hallway and computer room.  Most of the scenes of the film are in the living room.  So for those expecting a variety of scenes taking place in multiple locations, this is not one of those films.  \\"Carnage\\" is a film that focuses on characters, emotion and full-on verbal assaults.<br /><br />On DVD, picture quality is good but of course, I'm sure you will see much more clarity and detail from the Blu-ray version.  As for the audio, dialogue is clear and heard no hiss or any problems at all.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Carnage\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Actor's Notes - (10:38) The cast of \\"Carnage\\" talk about the storyline and the characters they play.<br />  An Evening with John C. Reilly and Christoph Waltz - (38:01) Featuring an interview Q&A with \\"Carnage\\" actors John C. Reilly and Christoph Waltz who talk about working on \\"Carnage\\", working with Roman Polanski and more.<br />  On the Red Carpet - (3:31) Interviews with the cast on the red carpet premiere.<br />  Theatrical Trailer - (2:04) The original theatrical trailer for \\"Carnage\\".<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Roman Polanski's \\"Carnage\\" film adaptation of the popular Yasmina Reza play is hilarious, chaotic and features magnificent performances by Jodie Foster, Kate Winslet, Christoph Waltz and John C. Reilly.<br /><br />I absolutely enjoyed this film to see how a simple conversation became complex and the intensity of the verbal assaults was hilarious and the performances, so powerful!  I have watched many films of conversations between individuals and there are some films such as \\"My Dinner with Andre\\" that focuses on a conversation but yet, becomes so witty and hilarious that you can't help but appreciate the film.<br /><br />The same goes for \\"Carnage\\".  While I have not seen the play, what I enjoyed about this film is how these four talents were able to transform their characters from civilized parents discussing their children to this breakdown of their characters as all gloves are off and the worst comes out of their mouths not just against the other parents, but couples start to fight each other.  It becomes wife vs. husband, wife vs. wife, husband vs. husband, wives against the husbands, it's just amazing how these adults lose control and I found the whole exchange quite hysterical.<br /><br />While a short film compared to other Roman Polanski films, as always with Polanski, it's attention to detail and subtlety and the way he was able to showcase the talent is amazing.  And you can't go wrong when you have Academy Award winning talent cast in your film.  I enjoyed the performances by Jodie Foster, Kate Winslet, Christoph Waltz and John C. Reilly but I just have to say that Jodie Foster in this film was absolutely fantastic!<br /><br />When you literally can see and feel the anger coming off Foster's character, it feels real, it looks real.  Her performance was amazing and I have no doubt that the other talents fed from that.  Not only did Foster deliver, you can see the anger in her face, the tension in her skin, the veins literally about to pop out, her performance was absolutely amazing!<br /><br />If anything, I was more curious about John C. Reilly as he was cast opposite of Foster. At first I thought that the chemistry was good, but then when you find out that the two traveled through Africa, the credibility of the two as a couple felt a bit off.  Nevertheless, the actor also held his own and also brought a more calming effect towards the beginning of this film.  Also, his role required a little bit more action of having to clean up the vomit and having to use the hairdryer quite a bit.<br /><br />And speaking of vomit, for those with a low-tolerance to films that showcase vomit, I just want to warn you right now that you're going to see some vomit chunks in this film.<br /><br />As for the DVD release, you get a hilarious Q&A segment with John C. Reilly and Christoph Waltz, plus the talent talking about their characters and also seeing them on the red carpet.  As mentioned, for those who want better PQ and AQ, definitely go for the Blu-ray release but as for the DVD is concerned, the film looks and sounds very good on DVD and because most of the entire film is shot inside a living room and the film relies on character performance, some may feel that the DVD will be good enough.<br /><br />As for the film's title, \\"Carnage\\", it has to do with the incident involving the children.  Jodie Foster as Penelope Longstreet rejects violence and wants civility, while Alan Cowan believes that his son and the use of physical force is part of humanity.  To see this mental breakdown among civilized people.<br /><br />For example, Penelope is the writer who has covered Africa.  In the beginning, she is civil but once her beloved books have vomit all over them, we start to see her change.  We also see her change and side with Nancy Cowan on Michael's treatment of the hamster.  We saw Michael being the calm one of the bunch but when his wife starts to unleash her anger towards him, we realize this conversation between these four adults is going nowhere.  But for the audience, it's the intensity of their exchange, the escalation of the verbal assaults that become quite hysterical and amusing.<br /><br />\\"Carnage\\" is a film that captivates you through escalating verbal assaults that lead to a chaotic disintegrating meeting between four adults who discuss their children's incident.  While I have heard that the play has much more than the film adaptation, on its own, you can't help but be amused by the wonderful performances by the talents.  Was it perfect?  Not at all, but the film does work and you can't help but laugh at what you see happening before your eyes.  I found it absolutely amusing.<br /><br />But of course, for some cinema fans, Roman Polanski taking on a dark comedy such as this, may seem like a step backwards or not in par compared to other films in his oeuvre.  It may not be one of his more memorable films but I do applause Roman Polanski trying something different.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Carnage\\" is a film that is full of intense emotion and yet, I found this film to be quite captivating and enjoyable.

But I have to admit that within the past few years, films coming out from Affirm Films have been pretty good and with the release of \\"Courageous\\", not only did I find this film to be inspiring and uplifting, but I found it to be a fantastic film overall.<br /><br />But most importantly, although it does have a preaching message, it's a message that I feel is quite relevant... Fathers, no matter how busy you are...be there for your children.  Be there for your family.  No matter how busy your job is, no matter if you come home late...find a way!<br /><br />The film was produced by Sherwood Pictures (the company behind \\"Flywheel\\", \\"Facing the Giants\\" and \\"Fireproof\\") and \\"Courageous\\" is their fourth film and is directed by Alex Kendrick, who co-wrote the story along with his brother Stephen Kendrick.  The film was produced with a budget for $2 million and grossed $9 million on its opening weekend.<br /><br />\\"Courageous\\" is a film that focuses on the lives of five men but the storyline centers on the character of Adam Mitchell.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Courageous\\" is presented in 2:35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen and presented in English, French and Portuguese 5.1 Dolby Digital and Spanish and Thai Dolby Surround.  If you want the best video and audio quality for this film, it's important to note that this film is available on Blu-ray.  But for the most part, the film looks very good on DVD, considering a lot of the shots are outdoors for this film.  Audio quality is very good, especially towards the end where there is a good amount of action and a heavy exchange of gunfire that utilizes the surround channels.  But for the most part, this film is dialogue driven through the center and front channels.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Chinese, Korean and Thai.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Courageous\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by Alex and Stephen Kendrick.<br />  Deleted Scenes - (11:45) A total of 12 deleted scenes.<br />  Outrageous: Outtakes and Bloopers - (7:17) The outtakes from \\"Courageous\\".<br />  Courageous in 60 Seconds - A quick run-through of \\"Courageous\\" in 60 seconds.<br />  The Making of Courageous - (23:20) Filming in Albany, Georgia and behind-the-scenes in the making of \\"Courageous\\".  Alex and Stephen Kendrick talks about how God has influenced them to make this film.  The Kendrick's talk about the message to family's about the importance of having a father figure.  And also the many volunteers who have come together in wanting to get God's message out through this film.<br />  The Heart of Courageous - (3:18) The producers and filmmakers talk about how having a father is important in a children's life.<br />  The Story of My Father - (8:51) Susan Sanders and Ray Woo) who took part in various roles for Sherwood Pictures talk about their role in film.  Susan talks about her father was not too attached to the family when she was younger and how belief in God changed their lives and brought daughter and father closer together.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />There have been many Christian films that have inspired me but \\"Courageous\\" was a film that probably had the most affect on me while watching it.<br /><br />As a father and unfortunately a workaholic, like many other father's similar to me who have a hard time of finding an end to work and spending time with the family, it hasn't been easy.  And to see this story that focuses on a man's duty to their family, and their duty to be there for them... I often wondered if many other men/fathers was also affected by the message of this film.<br /><br />As mentioned, Affirm Films, especially a film coming from Sherwood Pictures, these are Christian films and not every reviewer and not everyone who watches (especially those unaware that \\"Courageous\\" is a Christian film) will like the fact that this film does feature people who are spiritual, people who believe in God and yes, the message is preachy, not for religion but for fathers to be with their families and the importance of a child's development of having that father figure.<br /><br />The Kendrick brothers really know how to bring God's message out to a larger audience using them to communicate to their viewers.  And there was this feeling of an impact that I really can't describe but deep down in my heart, this film made perfect sense.  It made feel that in times of constant divorces, children separated from a parent...no one really talks about the children and how they are affected by it.<br /><br />I personally have seen family affected by divorce and especially the difficulties that children have faced when their father had left them.  Granted, none of the people I know have committed a crime but it affected their life and watched them fight frustrations during their younger years and then later as a parent because of it.  Granted, I do know of divorced fathers who make an effort to be with their children every weekend or everyday, even if its to talk to them, see them, have dinner or just a quick hello...they want to be in their children's life.<br /><br />So, the families depicted in this film, it's great to see how these friends evolved after their moment in crisis and to see those who were able to meet their resolution and unfortunately to see those who weren't able to.  The Mitchell families grief after the death of their daughter is rather emotional and the Kendrick brothers did a good job on focusing on their darker times but also their ability to move on and do something about their grief.  For Adam Mitchell, he may have lost a daughter but he still has a wife and son and he has to do all he can to provide for them but also be their for them.  And also to see how his friends were inspired by his dedication to his resolution.<br /><br />The character of Javier is an example of the average American suffering through the bad economy and trying to find work and take care of his family.  He knows that his family are in tough times and sure, his belief in God has made him positive and not a man in despair.  Most movies tend to showcase one's spiraling down until they crash hard during tough times but fortunately for this film, it doesn't happen that way.  Javier gets a job accidentally but its by people who are God believing people and are dedicated to their family.  They know he is a kind man,  a good man and let him become part of their circle but also extend their kindness in helping find a job.<br /><br />While the character of David represents the man who got a woman pregnant and has never seen their child.  Sure, the message is quite preaching towards fathers to take a responsibility and while some viewers may not like it, I for one am happy that the film does.  Not just for David but for all fathers...take responsibility for your family, be there for your children.  Some way, some how.<br /><br />\\"Courageous\\" is a film that any father can watch, feel proud if they have been able to be there for their family but for many others, the message is powerful enough to make them think, inspire and hopefully change their lives for the better.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Courageous\\" was an eye-opener and it's message really got through to me loud and clear.<br /><br />Inspiring, uplifting and a story with a message that is powerful and full of hope!  \\"Courageous\\" is wonderful film that I hope that many people, especially fathers...will watch and for some some, feel inspired to want to be there for their families and children!<br /><br />Definitely recommended!Mitchell families grief after the death of their daughter is rather emotional and the Kendrick brothers did a good job on focusing on their darker times but also their ability to move on and do something about their grief.

B006PTL1QM|3.0|From filmmaker David Cronenberg  (\\"The Fly\\", \\"Eastern Promises\\", \\"A History of Violence\\") comes his latest film \\"A Dangerous Method\\" based on the 1993 non-fiction book by John Kerr and a screenplay by Christopher Hampton, who wrote the original 2002 play \\"The Talking Cure\\" which was based on the book.<br /><br />The film has been in development for nearly a decade.  The film adaptation was to feature Julia Roberts but as time went on, Chris Hampton's play would be the first to be done but as time had passed and scheduling conflicts came in the way, by 2010, a film would be made and would star Viggo Mortensen (\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" films, \\"The Road\\", \\"A History of Violence\\"), Michael Fassbender (\\"Inglorious Basterds\\", \\"300', \\"X-Men: First Class\\"), Keira Knightley (\\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" films, \\"Pride & Prejudice\\") and Vincent Cassel (\\"Black Swan\\", \\"Shrek\\", \\"La Haine\\").<br /><br />And now, \\"A Dangerous Mind\\" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD in March 2012 courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"A Dangerous Method\\" is presented in 1:85:1 anamorphic widescreen and audio in English 5.1 Dolby Digital. Before I continue, it's important to note that this film will be released on Blu-ray, so if you want the best picture and audio quality, I recommend watching it on HD.<br /><br />With that being said, \\"A Dangerous Method\\" is a film that utilizes a lot of outdoor scenes and locations.  So, there are time that we see vibrant colors and overall lighting was good and while watching the film, I admit that in my mind, I was thinking how awesome a lot of these scenes would look in HD.  And along with the wonderful location shots and cinematography, the film features beautiful costume design and also set design as well.  As for the picture quality of DVD, overall picture quality is good but once again, if you want the detail and clarity, go for the Blu-ray version.<br /><br />As for audio, dialogue is clear and there are moments where ambiance such as Sabina being taken to the mental hospital, you can hear the sounds of her kicking things around inside the carriage through the surround channels.  But the film is primarily a center and front-channel driven film.<br /><br />The music from Howard Shore is quite impressive and Richard Wagner's \\"Sigfried Idyll\\" performed by Lang Lang and arranged by Howard Shore is absolutely beautiful.  One again, this is a beautiful soundtrack that would probably sound much better via lossless on Blu-ray but on DVD, overall dialogue and audio is clear with no problems that I can see or hear.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"A Dangerous Method\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Commentary with Director David Cronenberg - Featuring an in-depth audio commentary from Director David Cronenberg.<br />  The Making of A Dangerous Method - (7:41) Director David Cronenberg and the cast talk about working on the film.<br />  AFI's Harold Lloyd Master Seminar with David Cronenberg - (31:21) AFI interviews director David Cronenberg about how he came to direct \\"A Dangerous Method\\", how the film came to be and the making of the film.<br />  Theatrical Trailer - (1:56) The theatrical trailer for \\"A Dangerous Method\\".<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"A Dangerous Method\\" is an intriguing form of fiction based on the lives of Carl Jung, Sigmund Freud and Sabina Spielrein.<br /><br />For anyone who has studied psychiatry or are familiar with the people featured in the film, reading into the lives of Carl Jung and Sabina Spielrein seems like an emotional and intellectual drama.  And it doesn't surprise me that a film was made on them.<br /><br />For Carl Jung, so far it has been a few who have asserted that Jung and Spielrein have had a sexual relationship.  Afterall, it is known that Carl Jung had a long-time affair with Toni Wolff, a Swiss analyst who was also a patient of Carl Jung and had a relationship with his wife and Wolff simultaneously.  While withSabina Spielrein, there have been books since 1980 written about the relationship between Jung and Spielrein from 1904-1910 and that he did constitute an ethical breach of doctor-patient boundary while treating Spielrein.<br /><br />In 1994, letters and diaries were found in the Claparede archive in Geneva and these letters show that their relationship was non-sexual but more of a therapeutic nature.<br /><br />Needless to say, no one will ever know the truth if these two individuals did have a sexual relationship but we do know that Carl Jung did have an impact in the life of Sabina Spielrein.  We do know that Carl Jung contacted Sigmund Freud for advice in treating Sabina and that moment of time, both Jung and Freud became intellectual confidants.<br /><br />As for the rift that drove them apart, we know that Sabina had nothing to do with it, but it was two men with two different theories and both men being well-known in their field and doing all they can to have supporters of their ideas, the clash between both men were inevitable.<br /><br />So, while watching \\"A Dangerous Method\\", I did find Christopher Hampton's screenplay based on John Kerr's novel to be an intriguing take on this long-rumored interaction but also what caused the rift between Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud.<br /><br />The more you research Carl Jung, especially with the release of \\"The Red Book\\" in 2009 (a manuscript that he written right after his falling out with Jeung and was forbidden for public viewing by his family until a family heir decided to publish it a few years ago) which you realize that Jung was man who had dreams, an active imagination one would say and these were further explored in his book.<br /><br />And as for his relationships with his patients, while Tony Wolff was known to be his mistress, Sabina to be rumored as a woman he had an affair with for years, I did find it quite intriguing of how the storyline incorporated Otto Gross, who was a disciple of Sigmund Freud but treated by Carl Jung and is known as the founding grandfather of 20th Century Counterculture.  A free spirited manic depressive who was an extrovert addicted to sex.  Was it Otto Gross that helped lead Jung astray?  I found that intriguing.<br /><br />I'm not a Freud or Jung erudite, but I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed the performances by Viggo Mortensen, Michael Fassbender and Keira Knightley are fantastic.  How exact it is to their original counterparts, I don't know.  But Keira Knightley did a wonderful job in portraying a hysterical woman.  It's a performance that I have never seen by Knightley and in fact, whenever she did go into hysterics, I was freaked out a little as she would do this elongating of her jaw.  Needless to say, it was visually affective in portraying the character.<br /><br />Mortensen's Sigmund Freud was rather well-done.  Very stoic and serious, while Fassbender's performance of Carl Jung was very good, but it made me wonder if an intellectual like Jung was also a suave ladies man?  I felt that maybe he looked too cool, but then again, maybe Carl Jung was a classy, cool, suave intellectual.<br /><br />The cinematography by Peter Suschitzky (\\"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back\\", \\"Eastern Promises\\", \\"A History of Violence\\") was absolutely beautiful and vibrant and it helps to have a talented crew providing wonderful costume and set design as well. Also, I give credit to Howard Shore for providing beautiful, emotional, chaotic music to support what we see onscreen.<br /><br />As for the DVD, fans of David Cronenberg will enjoy his AFI interview but also his audio commentary which he really delves into the characters and his interested in doing a film about Freud.<br /><br />But as I did enjoy the performances, the cinematography and music, I do have a problem with the film's storyline overall.<br /><br />Once again, this film is fiction based on assertions that Sabina Spielrein and Carl Jung had a sexual relationship.  But if letters were found to show that it was factual, I wouldn't be surprised because we know that Jung had an affair and a relationship with Tony Wolff, a former patient of his and a future analyst.<br /><br />But I enjoyed the film for giving attention to Sabina Speilrein, as she was the first person to introduce the idea of death instincts (best known for her published work \\"Destruction as the Cause of Coming into Being\\"), a concept that Sigmund Freud would incorporate into his own theory.  She was also known to introduce psychoanalysis to Russia and was an inspiration to future psychoanalysts, including Swiss developmental psychologist Jean Piaget.<br /><br />Always known as a footnote in Sigmund Freud's book and considered as a \\"forgotten pioneer of psychoanalysis\\", unfortunately Sabina Speilrein's life in reality was cut short and her two children were killed by a German SS Death Squad.  But her contributions as a psychoanalysis should have been shown.  This woman's work have been forgotten and now that she has been brought back to the masses, she is not seen for her accomplishments but her sadistic needs.<br /><br />It is known that Spielrein had wrote about masochism and the sadistic component of sexual drive as a \\"destructive drive\\" but does it mean she was a woman who loved to be spanked by Carl Jung?  Those scenes I found a bit worrisome as people will see her more as Carl Jung's sexual exploit rather than her contributions as a psychoanalyst.<br /><br />Overall, \\"A Dangerous Method\\" is an exploitative, sensational and intriguing take on Carl-Gustav Jung and Sabina Spielrein, and Jung's his split with his intellectual confidant Sigmund Freud, but I do admit that I found the treatment of Sabina Speilrein's life to be troubling and misleading. It's bad enough that her career as a psychoanalysis was never recognized (possibly because in that era she was a woman in man's world and not taken seriously by her peers) but to summarize her life as a character that is always craving for attention and wanting to be spanked, I found it the most unfortunate.  And like Freud's footnote to credit her career, Cronenberg also ends with a title of Spielrein's accomplishments and tragic death.<br /><br />For so long, many have hoped for Speilrein to be known for her work and no longer be \\"forgotten\\".  Unfortunately, \\"A Dangerous Method\\" is a film that no only hurts her reputation and paints nothing more but a hysterical love toy but also is a film that is possibly quite damaging to the legacy of Carl Jung.<br /><br />While \\"A Dangerous Method\\" does make for intriguing cinema. I do hope that viewers know to discern that this is not a film based on fact, but a fictional tale.eated by Carl Jung and is known as the founding grandfather of 20th Century Counterculture.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  Once I began reading this book, I had a deep need to keep reading to try to figure out this complicated and disturbing relationship that is unfolding on the pages in front of me.<br /><br />Anastasia Steele, a young and inexperienced woman, who by all rights seems to be in a bubble, untouched by this world, naive is putting it mildly.  When her roommate and best friend comes down with the flu, it is Ana who must conduct an interview with the ever illusive Christian Grey.  It is like sending a lamb to the slaughter.  Christian is damaged goods and that is putting it mildly. He has had a rough start in this life and although he was rescued and raised in a loving family he still carries guilt, shame and self loathing to such an extent he doesn't feel he will ever be able to be \\"normal\\".  When they meet the sparks will fly.  They are drawn to each other, the chemistry is palpable.<br /><br />Ana is loving and giving, but confused by Christian's needs and desires.  She doesn't think she could ever be what he needs her to be.  Christian is controlling and dark, he only desires Ana as his submissive, he does not do \\"more\\"  yet as the story unfolds he strives to be her \\"more\\" but his dark desires and controlling methods are just too much for the inexperienced Ana. Their best method of communication is through email, it seems to be the only place they can really communicate and be honest and open with each other and I must say the banter at times would have me laughing out loud.<br /><br />The relationship is fifty shades of messed up.  But, you can't help but keep turning the pages to see what twists and turns will be in store for this couple. The BDSM and sex scenes are not over the top.  Their desire for each other leaps off the pages.<br /><br />This is a love story.  The love story of Christian and Ana, and their struggles to make their relationship work.  To be what the other needs them to be. I was sucked in from the begging to the end.And what a cliff hanger at the end it was. I immediately had to download the second book to see what was to happen next.  A must read to be sure!

B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I bought this DVD when it just came out.  I watched it and did not like it.  I just finished reading the book - again - and watching all the DVD's I own.  I give top rank to the 1995 BBC version with the 1980 BBC version a close second.  I have to say that the Hollywood version with Olivier was not that good and had several big flaws- I would not even rank it.  Unfortunately,  I watched this 2006 version  from beginning to end and, again, I did not find much to like.  The scenery and music were wonderful; however, the characters are not developed well with Lizzie being  a big disappointment - she did not behave ladylike, she seemed to just giggle and had no wit.  Mr Bingley  appears as a foolish young man without much going for him - can he be Mr Darcy's closest friend?  Can Jane fall madly in love with him?  Mr Bennet does not strike me as gentleman like - he was a landed gentleman with an adequate income, but a spendthrift wife.  I like Mr. Darcy, but he is still in third place.  I would have liked to see more of Mr Wickham - but we don't get to know him, and consequently cannot dislike him as we should.<br /><br />How improper to have Mr. Bingley go into the room where Jane is in bed with a cold - they seem to have copied the scene from the Hollywood version.  Did Mr. Darcy sneak into the Collinses house to give Lizzie the letter or I got that wrong?  If so, it would have been unthinkable behavior for Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />If this movie would have been presented with a different title and in a modern setting, I may have given it at least four stars.  I will keep the DVD and maybe I will watch it again in a few years - I may change my mind, but I doubt it.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|As an avid reader of science fiction from a young age, it takes a great story with well defined characters to impress me. This book has just that and more, a gripping story that pulls you along always wanting more. Fortunately this author delivers.  Howey delves into the silo and its wonderfully developed cast of characters, going deeper and deeper into the story. Smoothly transitioning from one character to the next, you begin to feel like you are part of the story.<br /><br />Normally I don't bring my kindle with me but I found myself addicted to this book, taking any spare moment to read it. Once I finished, I was delighted to find that there is a sixth book in the series and can't wait to begin reading more about how the world outside the silo was ravaged and how it all began.<br /><br />This is a tale not about the end of society as we know it, but about what goes on after, Our Legacy. Trapped inside the silo deep in the earth, the outside air unbreathable, how does one keep order and happiness in a society of people living within a building with no chance of expansion?

B0060V1WJ6|2.0|What a waste. My husband and I rarely get enough time to sit down and enjoy a movie, and we wasted time trying. We kept watching thinking, maybe this will get better. It didn't, so we decided to make fun of it, at least that got us laughing.<br /><br />My husband thinks he has a paper from his creative writing class in 10th grade that would make a better script.<br /><br />Don't watch this movie unless you are 12 or high.
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|The movie was so funny I could not breathe for half of it! It's my new favorite comedy. I wasn't sure about it going in and the first laugh was kind of a shock where people didn't know if they should laugh, but I could hold back. Soon the entire room was filled with laughter and it didn't stop until the end! Not for kids or teens though unless you have low moral standards.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|I was a bit disappointed.  This book was written really poorly; but, it was quite a story.  After seeing interviews with this girl, I must say its a bit unbelievable all around.  I do believe it all happened to her.  Her reactions or lack thereof are hard to swallow.

Good girl!!  Am disappointed there are no lyrics with it. That would have been perfect.  Am looking forward to more from Adele.  God bless her...
B005AFB69E|5.0|As fan of this movie, I am so pleased I can finally add it to my Blu-ray collection.  This is well worth the wait for the import and it played beautifully on my home theater.  Count me in as another pleased customer of David Ho (boyoyo).  Buy from him with confidence!
B007FH9GT2|5.0|Really enjoyed the film, so well done. The acting, directing and filming were wonderful. Didn't enjoy the opening credit images or music, thought it was really out of touch with the story, having seen the original before this. I will watch this again. I hope they are going to make the other films in the trilogy as well. Looking forward to them.

0345803485|4.0|I loved this book, which was a huge surprise to me. I've never read anything quite so... um, kinky! I fell in love with Christian and Anastasia, and the story stuck in my head non-stop as I attempted to go about my day. Minor editing issues distracted me, but overall didn't bother me too much. Upon completion of the book, I immediately downloaded Fifty Shades Darker!

B0071XO8RA|4.0|I was surprised how good this was considering the low cost. I had never heard of it. I purchased all 5 books in the Omnibus edition. I like the post apocalyptic/dystopian genre but haven't really read that much of it. I really enjoyed \\"The Hunger Games\\" I read all three books and while this wasn't quite as good, in my opinion it was better than \\"The Knife of Never Letting Go\\". I'm looking forward to more from this author.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Well designed and executed game that requires thought, but is also relaxing. Puzzle game designed around touch screen, rather than so many games that try to adapt old concepts to touch screen. I don't understand complaints about Facebook, it doesn't keep asking me to rate on Facebook or connect to Facebook, its just an option on the main menu. No popup for Facebook or other social media crap that I could see.
B0042816YK|3.0|I preferred the novel to the movie. At times, the movie felt shallow, and self-absorbed.<br /><br />There are a few problems with this story (love it or hate it); but at the end of the day, it's a one woman's journey. Everyone is different.<br /><br />Javier was fun to watch (and sexy, as always) but I'm not sure Julia Roberts was the rights cast for this character. She seemed too cold and distant; I didn't really see the chemistry between them.<br /><br />But, I enjoyed the locations, the cinematography was superb, and it inspired me to travel more (and that's good) . . . I'm going to Italy this summer.<br /><br />I think the story is about taking a stand for you own life. Do the things you need to do. This, to me is an important message women need to hear more often.<br /><br />A movie to watch with your girlfriend, a glass of wine; if . . . you're preparing for a trip to Bali or Italy.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Alright, first off I want to admit that I'm a bit affected by what I'm going to call the \\"Inception\\" effect. I started off reading this book expecting it to be basically the best book ever. 554 reviews, and only 10 are less than 3 stars? I guess its fair to say my expectations were higher that they should have been. So when I set off to write this review, I wanted to give the book a lower rating just to offset the huge amount of overly positive reviews. I convinced myself that 2 stars was too mean, but maybe it does deserve a 4 instead of a 3. Maybe.<br /><br />Anyway, off to the real content of the review: I'm really a story and character guy. I can't really tell you much about the quality of writing, just the story and characters. The main problem I had with this book was maintaining my suspension of disbelief. I like my stories to be plausible, even if they are impossible. There were several very unbelievable things in this book that I could not shake.<br /><br />---Begin minor (but I think inconsequential) spoilers--<br /><br />The stairs:<br />There is NO WAY that it takes 2 days to descend 148 flights of stairs. Lets say you spend 8 hours of the day climbing. That's not too much, plenty of time for food and breaks on the way. That's (16*60)/148 minutes per flight. Almost 6.5 minutes. The stairs in my building have 17 steps per flight. Now the silo is a big building with lots of stuff in it. Let's give Mr. Howey the benefit of the doubt and say there are 30 steps per flight. That's probably 18 foot ceilings. That still means it takes you on average 13 seconds PER STEP. Count that out. That's painfully slow.<br />EDIT: As a commenter below pointed out, I severely underestimated the height of each level. It's nice to know the story is realistic, but I shouldn't have to do research on this sort of thing. Having floors separated by such a distance is big detail that could have informed my view of the world pretty significantly.<br /><br />Anyway, that may seem really trivial to you, but these are the sort of thing that ripped me out of the context of the book. They really have no elevator, even for big machines and objects? You can't have cleaners who come back inside after some decontamination? People only get upset at point X, and not before? I ran into other problems as the story progressed particularly with how Mr. Howey asserted particular people or groups of people would act, but I don't want to include any big spoilers here. If you can get past little inconsistencies like that, you'll probably enjoy the book much more than I did. Me? I like SF for descriptions of interesting, believable worlds. I didn't find that here.

B005S9EJZA|5.0|As a writer and philosopher, this movie in particular just blew me away. The first time I saw the previews for it, I remember thinking that it seemed to have an interesting quality to it which appealed to both my intellectual trades mentioned above. The first time I saw it, I was just blown away, as have I been in the three other times I've gone to see it.<br /><br />Logan Thibault (Zac Efron) comes off as being the kind of character who you can really learn a lot from in terms of lust plain old life experiences in general. What other people brand as being 'mushy' or 'cheesy' I see as being the truth towards understanding how no matter what hand of cards you're dealt in your life, there is always hope. All you got to to is go and find it. Logan finds himself in this situation while on deployment in the Middle East, where a single, split second decision to pick up a photo amidst a pile of rubble undoubtedly comes to change the course of his entire life. After coming to the realization that finding that photo truly spared his life, along with knowing so many others were not so lucky, he finds himself obliged and determined to find the girl in the photo and thank her.<br /><br />After a brief stay with his sister in Colorado, he sets off on foot to find this girl. His search takes him to a small town in Louisiana where once meeting her, his initial goal of thanking her is derailed as he suddenly finds himself falling in love with her, as well as growing to be very fond of both her eight-year-old son and her feisty grandmother. One thing in particular that I admired greatly about Logan's character is that he never once detered or swayed when it came to helping someone else in need, or standing beside them when they needed support. This is shown in the film when he rises to support Beth when she is grieving over the loss of her brother as well as amidst the conflict with her abusive ex-husband. At the same time, his imperfections are conveyed through his struggle to comeclean with the true reason for which he intended to find Beth.<br /><br />Out of everything, the most prominent element of Logan's character which resonated in my mind is the level of humility present in his character. He's not afraid to see things as they really are in his life, and tries his best to change what he can. Even when confronting Beth over the matter of Derek's picture, he makes his best effort to address the situation as honestly as he can, even when it could mean losing Beth and her family forever. Probably the most shining moment of the movie comes at the end, after Logan explains to Beth the details of her brother's death which she has wanted to know since his death, when the sum of all of Logan's actions come together to reward him in the form of Beth saying to him, \\"You belong here.\\"<br /><br />I know this as a fact, from personal experience, to be one of life's greatest lessons, and some people's inability to understand it is to be expected, as people are not perfect. That just makes the experiences of those who do even more culturally prominent, because passing that lesson on to another person is undoubtedly the most remarkable gift one person can give to another. Therefore, I raise my glass to Sparks, Efron and all those involved and say,<br />\\"Well done, my friends. Well done.\\"
1468179993|5.0|This book was a godsend. I was nervously preparing for a TEDx talk on April 14 when a business colleague tipped me off about this book. I devoured it, read it cover to cover three times and marked and highlighted it to excess.<br /><br />It is short, well organized, breezy, and full of good examples of TED talks that you can access on the Internet. This book was an immense help in preparing my talk. I didn't deliver one of the world's most inspiring presentations but it was far better with Mr. Donovan's tutelage than it would have been otherwise.<br /><br />I recommend this book for anyone having to give a short public speech. It will help you deliver an audience worthy presentation.
B007SGM084|2.0|I am excited to read this book, but don't know why the three books together cost more than if I buy them individually. Isn't the whole point of a bundle to get a deal? Doesn't make sense to me. It costs $0.02 more to buy this than to buy the three separately. I know it's splitting hairs, but I think it's crazy.<br /><br />I doubt the price is going to go down at all with the sudden popularity, which is disappointing. Hoping to see it added to the Prime Library soon.

B0070BG10U|5.0|Rock/Pop artists have tried producing classical works in the past with competent to mediocre results. Sir Paul McCartney comes to mind, being one of the most melodic songwriters of all time. His \\"Liverpool Oratorio Suite\\" and \\"Ecce Cor Meum\\" received modest reviews. So when former Bee Gees member Robin Gibb and his son RJ stepped up to the plate to honor the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic, the skeptics were waiting.<br /><br />The work is not a rock opera, an Andrew Lloyd Weber production, nor even a purely classical piece. It takes the strengths of all these elements and produces one unique experience. Its actually an ingenious idea that Robin Gibb would take his fascination of the Titanic and use it to emote an interweaving composition of absolute drama. Using the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, forty-two strong chorus members bursting forth in Latin ('Latin Mass for the Dead') and three unique soloists, 'The Titanic Requiem\\" comes very close to nailing a perfect movement that easily pulls emotion from the listener. The layered mixture of vocals and orchestration can be startling given that this is the first work of this kind from Robin Gibb.<br /><br />Most of the pieces are somber and heartfelt without much levity. In fact, only \\"Farewell (The Immigrant Song)\\" and \\"Maiden Voyage\\" contain glimmers of happiness and hope. Soon, pieces like, \\"Kyrie\\" and \\"Sos (Tract)\\" give way to a more serious and foreboding sense. A listener may find a few of the pieces ponderous or even too grave, but perhaps that was the point; to give the listener no chance for composure given the severity in the wake of this most famous disaster. The three solo vocalist songs are truly beautiful, and the lyrics (particularly \\"Daybreak\\" and \\"Don't Cry Alone\\") suck sorrow from the gut with surprising ease. In fact, Robin Gibb's trembling \\"Don't Cry Alone\\" is one of his most startlingly aching vocals to date.<br /><br />To compare the \\"The Titanic Requiem\\" to anything other than itself would be a disservice as it truly does not easily fall into any one category. It is a work from a father and son who let out all emotional stops, in severe illness and health, to deliver a truly unique and satisfying hybrid of musical compositions. \\"The Titanic Requiem\\" begs numerous listening.elf would be a disservice as it truly does not easily fall into any one category.

B007N8RULO|5.0|I love this game! it is challenging but fun. I don't think I will be able to go back to regular solitaire. if your a big solitaire fan this is a must get. plus its free so its like a added bonus. again I say this is a must buy!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If you are hesitant to read this book, I may be able to help. I was there too.<br /><br />I first heard about this book on a blog where a reader was posting their favorite books.  I looked it up, read a couple pages into the sample and then kept it on my kindle for a few months.  I read the top Kindle books list often and suddently I see not the first book, but all 3, hogging up the top 10.<br /><br />I read the description again.  I read the reviews.  Neither the good, nor the bad enticed me to make a decision.  A couple weeks later, I do the same thing. For the record, I also did this with Twilight and the Hunger Games.  Both of which I ended up loving.<br /><br />Finally I make the purchase and dive in.  And I find I was just like the character.  Overthinking it.<br /><br />It really is a good book.  It's so intense, and different.<br /><br />The first person view really gets you into the story. I thought this is what Twilight did so well. It puts you IN the story. Many times I felt as aprehensive as Ana, wondering whether or not forward is the way to go.  You feel her reservations and fear as well as her excitement.  Also, there is constant action, and it't not just the storyline. ;-)  I know this book is fanfiction and that is one of the things that put me off but I didn't feel I was reading a Twilight knockoff at all.  Only one line was blatant and other than the intense draw these two people have to one aother, the other things weren't obvious or in the way.  I probably wouldn't have even known it was fan fiction if I had read it in the comments.<br /><br />Now to address the things I read in the reviews:<br /><br />1) This is NOT some story about a creepy manipulator.  He's intense for sure.  But he never forces her into anything. He doesn't try to persuade her.  He's very honest about his way of relationships.  And she's just as curious as she is scared.  She s NOT some poor victim.  I couldn't disagree more with any comments than those making him to be this \\"bad guy\\".  He even concedes his thinking to adapt to her.  He struggles just as much as she does to meet her on her needs. It IS a little creepy he followed her, but he's an intense person, not evil.<br /><br />2) The writing being poor?  I honestly don't get these book snobs that say crap like this.  The writing is FINE if not excellent.  I don't read books to assess the writers ability or techniques.  I read for the enjoyment of the story. If I'm following the story and enjoying it, it' good enough writing for me.  The only times I will ever complain about writing is with certain authors who go into such detail over the leaves on the trees, etc to set up a scene.  Or if the writing is god awful/unbelievable in dialogue.  This book is none of those things.  The author gets down to business of telling the story and the characters are written in a believable way.<br /><br />3) The fans of the book are right.  The emails are awesome!  They really bring realism to the book.  This book doesn't have that fluffy over the top romance writing.  It's genuine.  She's torn, he's torn. And the emails really show the characters in a real scenario and it makes the story that much better.<br /><br />4) One criticism I did agree with was the overuse of the \\"inner Goddess\\" she reffered to (her sexuality/subconscious).  Although I don't know how she would else refer to it if using a \\"name\\", but it got a little old always reading what the \\"inner Goddess\\" was telling her.  This is where the writing failed a tad, but not so much to ruin the journey.<br /><br />A word of caution...in case you didn't figure it out by the storyline.  This book has some pretty intense adult scenes. When it gets into the nitty gritty of his world, it's written like erotica. So if you are timid you may not care for those parts.<br /><br />As popular as these books are right now, I wouldn't be suprised if some couples start \\"experimenting\\".  You may want to buy stock in companies that provide such items....An adult version of Twilight mania.<br /><br />Yesterday, I came up on 2 friends and one was talking about how she was in this book and her husband was trying to talk to her and she was in this big part.  I asked her what she was reading and she was not only reading this book but we were at the same part the night before.  We both agreed, this book is intense and you can't stop reading it.  It's like a peek into a world other than our own.<br /><br />I just finished the book today, and will be reading 2 by tonight.<br /><br />NOTE:<br />For a good laugh go to you tube and watch the video Ellen did as \\"reading for the audiobook\\".  It's awesome!

1449305172|4.0|I found this book to be very thought provoking. Several years ago I worked as an independent consultant and really enjoyed it. But I always only sold my time. I think most people who do have a entrepreneurial spirit understand that to really succeed you must leverage this and sell something more.<br /><br />This book focuses on how to approach the creation of a product with constraints placed on you and your team. It is pretty common to have minimal resources when starting a business. This includes money, people and the `right ideas'. Below are some of my thoughts about each of these limited resources and some of what I took away from my reading of the book:<br /><br />1) Limited Money: The author talks about how it can be difficult to raise money to fund your startup - but follows up with this actually being an advantage. Here is a quote that I particularly liked:<br /><br />\\"Constraints drive innovation, but more important, they force action. With less money, you are forced to build less, get it out faster, and learn faster.\\"<br /><br />Having \\"too\\" much money could actually keep you from the hard driving and tight focus that is required to actually get a product out the door.<br /><br />2) Limited People: Another issue the author talks about is the limited people that are typically available to a startup. This often means that you (and others) will need to fill multiple roles on the team - often with each role being something that would be a full time job. This again helps to keep a focus on doing the most important tasks, and knowing that some things simply will not get done. Be sure that understanding your customer (#3 below) is not one of the things that you let slip!<br /><br />This is where you will call up any and all learning from your past about prioritization, organization and effectiveness. You will need to decide how best to schedule your days, weeks and months to maximize the efficiency of the work you do. The author calls out that he has found scheduling customer interviews on Mondays and Fridays to less effective than doing this midweek. Also, if you are actively building the product you will want to be sure to have some blocks of time that you can get in \\"the flow\\". Here is another section out of the book:<br /><br />\\"Activities that flow typically have the following attributes:<br />They have a clear objective.<br />- The need your full concentration.<br />- They lack interruptions and distractions.<br />- They provide clear and immediate feedback on progress toward the objective<br />- They offer a sense of challenge.\\"<br /><br />The author has found that early mornings are often best for him to achieve this flow - I find that late nights currently work better for me.<br /><br />3) The `Right Ideas': The author brings out the point that it is very easy to focus only on your desires and experiences when working to create a product - but cautions against this and talks strongly about the need to work very closely with your targeted customers. Be sure that you have an understanding of the pain points of your target customers and that you are not too focused on only your experiences or your desire to implement some fancy technology! Again a few quotes from the book should help illustrate the authors thinking:<br /><br />\\"Given the right context, customers can clearly articulate their problems, but it's your job to come up with the solution\\"<br /><br />\\"Customer Discovery is about exploring what you don't know you don't know\\"<br /><br />In this section of the book the author also quotes Henry Ford \\"If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.\\")<br /><br />A large portion of the book really lays out a plan to be sure that you have a very open conversation with your users (or potential users) and to ensure that you learn from them what their `real problem' is and validate your solution to that problem.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this book and highly recommend it if you haveany thoughts of starting a company or building a product. But even beyond that, I think that it can open your mind to some new ways of thinking and delivering whatever product or service you deliver - even to your employer.<br /><br />A final quote from the book that sums things up pretty well (in my opinion):<br /><br />\\"Running Lean is a systematic process for iterating from Plan A to a plan that works, before running out of resources.\\"<br /><br />Disclosure: I was given a copy of this book to review by theO'Reilly Blogger Review Program

0439023513|1.0|Have you every started a book and it just wasn't good but you read through it because eventually it did or because the rest of the series was good, well that's not the case here.  This was awful from start to finish.  Katniss is simply an \\"unlikeable\\" character from the get go, sure she has some redeeming qualities in the first book, but she slowly starts to lose them and before I even got mid-point in this book I totally stopped liking the character and everything and anything to do with her made me cringe, which was pretty much the whole book.<br /><br />She spends most of her time hiding, being whinny, and the fact that not until past half way through the book did she even consider trying to save Peeta, she was to wrapped up in her own world.  Especially since Peeta sacrificed so much for her.  Hell she didn't think of anyone else but herself and Gale really, and it wasn't about love or him knowing her, it was about sheer selfishness on her part.  And Gale was never a likable character for me at all, he was always to full of hate and destruction from the beginning.  I think Peeta would have been better off without her.<br /><br />The book just went on and on about descriptions of rooms living, sleeping, bathrooms, hallways, outside, inside, hiding places, it was just awful.  I think Collins ran out of ideas before getting to the end, didn't have enough material for the last book slow she dragged everyone through a painful death to have to read it.<br /><br />The first book was fairly good, different, book 2 was a little less likeable, book 3 should never have happened.  This could have been a 2 book deal and it would have been a lot better.<br /><br />Last time I go with the hype and read something just to see what all the fuss is.  I've had these books since they first came out and could not get past the first 3 or so chapters of the first book and decided not to read them... I should have gone with my gut and stayed away.<br /><br />I've never given a book 1 star, I always try and find something redeemable about it, but this one has too much wrong with it to use that to help boost the star rating.  Nope 1 star it is.
1594744769|2.0|This book is ok, but it's really fiction for (very) young adults. Every plot point is heavily foreshadowed by the protagonist, and boy oh boy is he dumb. The concept is intriguing, but poorly executed became the main character it an imbecile. Skip it, the Hunger Games books are 1000x more complex than this boring tome.

It wouldn't collect it. disappointing. to get that far and have the game mess up.<br />Also skip the sick pioneer side missions. so much work for very little reward. I deleted app since it messed up. no way I'm starting over.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I first bought these when I again had to replace the 12 pacifiers that had gone missing. My daughter had grown accustom to the feel of the hospital brand pacifiers since she spent a couple of months there after birth. I came across these and bought them because they were super cute but was unsure if my daughter would like them. Previously I had bought pacifiers that looked like the ones the hospital provided but were not. The plastic used to make them were shiny and for whatever reason my daughter had no interest in them. I later discovered that the Gum Drop pacifiers were identical to the ones provided by hospitals. They have a vast variety of styles and colors like [[ASIN:B000ZEXKJE GumDrop Pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Orange 5 Pack]] and [[ASIN:B007VSM3CM Gum Drop Preemie Pacifier Vanilla Scent (Green)]] for preemies. These wubbanubs were in fact made of the same material and perfect for my little one. I only wished I had found them sooner since my other two children are grown. I could have saved myself from trips to the crib in the middle of the night to give baby back her pacifier. These pacifiers are perfect for little hands to find and grab in the middle of the night. My daughter just puts her own pacifier back in her mouth. I have yet to lose these unlike the gazillion other pacifiers I have purchased over the years. They make a great toy for baby as well. While the pacifier is in her mouth she tends to play with the plush and tag. It is a somewhat meditative motion that helps to sooth her and/or occupy her in her carseat/stroller/crib. So not only is it a pacifier and toy but it helps build motor skills. There are a number of different colors, animals and even textures like this one [[ASIN:B0031W38YO Wubbanub Plush Pacifier Toy, Mango Monkey]]. The [[ASIN:B0028H3ACS WubbaNub Tabby Kitten]] is my favorite.  I have noticed that it is slightly smaller than the other ones I've purchased but my daughter loves it just the same.  The pacifier itself is sewn very well to the plush, however, I usually cut the pacifier out after its seen some wear. Just as a caution. Once you stitch the the hole back you have another little toy for baby to play with unlike the plain pacifiers that you have to dump. They make great gifts and additions to a shower basket. I have bought many for my friends. When you think of the must haves in baby gear, I personally would add this to my list.<br /><br />Update: To wash or sterilize, I place a small plastic sandwich bag around the plush to prevent it from getting wet. I can then wash the pacifier with warm water and anti-bacterial soap or clean with a baby safe sterilizer.  Then I just take a sterile wipe or even a baby wipe to gently rub the plush doll.  It has worked well for me and keeps baby's gear germ free.
B005K17RU0|5.0|love it! great way to plan my day! I have it on my phone too!!!! wouldn't know what to do without it!
B007NYODBS|1.0|This movie was not entertaining.  It was not thought provoking and the acting was bad.  In a nutshell the movie was boring.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|WOW I Loved this one better than the first one. Book Two goes more into understanding Christian. With the added benefit of watching the whole LOVE story unfold. If you are looking for a great romance novel.....this ones for you. If you are looking for a Pulitizer Prize winning novel...not so much. If you can get behind the sex....and yes theres a lot of it....underneath is a great story. However unlike some sequels you really need to read Book One before this one.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|it is an interesting story line and each book steers you in a different direction. unforunately the next book i bought i didnt need because its the second book i already bought with the trilogy.<br />other then that its great.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I play with my daughter and she calls it her house. something fun to keep her occupied. pretty easy and guides you throughout the game.
B007R41E8O|5.0|I loved this game nice and long well worth the price.!<br /><br />must have your wick on to play.<br /><br /> after I finished I came back and bought their other games.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is the Kindle version of Mario Bros ...this is soon to be a classic. !! ! ! ! !!!! ! ! ! ! ! !
B0069P0DU2|5.0|This silicone mold is awesome! It is called an ice tray, but I used it to make candies for my son's birthday party.  When we unmolded Darth Vader we were very impressed.  The likeness is perfect and I know the kids will love them!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this game it iz really cool and it allows me 2 play a lot of games with this one app... :)
0756404738|5.0|I was told to purchase \\"The Name of the Wind\\" shortly after it came out. I absolutely loved and couldn't wait for the second day to come out. \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" has been well worth the purchase. Yes it is a longer book, but Patrick really knows how to write. I love how he uses the first person way of writing to portray the story vs the third person. This gets you right into the main characters mind and I feel I understand the choices Kvothe (main character) makes because of it. I usually have a hard time getting into books, but Patrick know how to capture your attention and hold it. Highly recommend this book to anyone even if you don't usually get into fantasy type books. The fantasy part isn't over bearing but does play a big role in this boys life. Great Read!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really love this game. It is different than the eInk game I loved so much on my original Kindle. That's ok though because this one is just as much fun! Now having said that I do have a BIG favor to ask&hellip;would you please&hellip;pretty please create a ThreadWords game app??? I truly miss that wonderfully game and spent many hours playing it. My son and I used it as a way to improve our vocabulary. You would not believe how many four letter words neither one of us have ever even heard of!!  Of course there are many amalgam games out there. However we are looking for the one where the words are already there. It is available for the regular Kindle.  It is the ONLY game that gets my youngest son away from Call of Duty or Mine Craft!!! Please help us out here!!! Thanx for Solitaire though!! Tamye
B007V2UGPE|5.0|like I said its awesome. fun and addictive with a hint of challenge. and come on its freewho could beat that!
B007V2UGPE|3.0|I find the game enjoyable but the notifications are a bit over the top. I have issues with glitch's in the ad's
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love having access to God's word on my phone. I can read any time of the day no matter where I'm at!
B005LAIGPU|2.0|Although the characters start off quite likable and interesting, the super power element ends up forcing the plot down a very cliche super hero route.  The film is quite reminiscent of The Craft only with a male cast.  In other words a group of teenage friends who are bonded by their sudden introduction to the supernatural.<br /><br />Dane DeHaan stars with a mopey vulnerability that's quite authentic, but unfortunately the film drives that single emotional note to the extreme.  His character becomes implausible, difficult to sympathize with, and down right annoying.  Generally I found especially the final act of this film (Spoiler: Andrew's major breakdown to a super villain) to be a huge failure, simply because it relied too heavily on multiple implausibilities.<br /><br />The film probably would have worked better if it stuck to its more basic human elements.
B007C4ZJ3K|1.0|Please don't watch this.  You will get to the end and ask, why.  It is a waste of time.  Horribly boring.  Please, just save yourself the time and watch something else.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I love this game! But after a few times playing it said it was the other persons turn when it was actually my turn. I couldn't play them back! Am I the only one with this problem?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book I could not put it down. Its a good read and also great of u want something quick. I saw the movie after I finished the book and while the movie was good the book is a million times better.
B000002LFZ|4.0|This CD catches most of the big US hits.  Missing hit singles include \\"Think About Me\\" (peaked at #20 on the Billboard 100), \\"Love in Store\\" (#22), and \\"Seven Wonders\\" (#19).  Although not a US singles hit, \\"Diane\\" could have been included based on being a top 10 UK hit.  And some important album tracks could have been included like \\"Landslide\\", \\"The Chain\\", \\"Gold Dust Woman\\", and \\"Never Going Back Again\\".<br /><br />\\"No Questions Asked\\",which is included on this CD, may be a good tune, but it was not a singles hit in the US.<br /><br />I did take the studio version of \\"Big Love\\" from this CD for my sometimes-deejay activity.<br /><br />A better compilation choice might be \\"The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac\\". That two-CD set includes all of the above-mentioned tunes except for \\"Diane\\".
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book!!! Could not put it down, this is a must read book! Great for all ages and all types of readers.
B00006JL1Z|4.0|For my sometimes-deejay library, I took all but two of my Fleetwood Mac tunes from this CD.  One of those two tunes was a studio version of \\"Big Love\\" rather than the live version on this CD. I took the studio version from the Fleetwood Mac Greatest Hits CD.  The other tune was \\"Diane\\", a fifties-sounding tune that didn't chart in the US but went to No. 9 in the UK.  I downloaded that from iTunes.<br /><br />The tracks on this CD seemed to be generally compressed, something that doesn't always make me happy.  There also could have been better volume balancing within some tracks, and some of the fade outs seemed a bit long.<br /><br />My impression of Fleetwood Mac was definitely increased after reviewing their tunes.  They displayed a lot of creative effort.
B00542UOEG|5.0|We live in Beverly Hills, and found this documentary (it's not?) wholly realistic except that they confused Chihuahuas with the poodles that actually are native to the ivy and Ponderosa pines, the hills (why do you think they named it Beverly Hills?) and the flats of Beverly Hills. Seriously, it's a very original and funny movie begging for a sequel. A sassy comedy!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Coolest app on your devise.  DOWNLOAD IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Samurai vs Zombies Defence rocks!!!!!!!!!!! 5star game.  This could be the coolest game ever.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I'm glad this is FINALLY available. Amazon needs to stay on top of popular apps! Much easier to play this on a tablet.
B005LAIGPU|4.0|If you have seen other Found Video like Cloverfield, Blair Witch Project, or Paranormal Activity, I think this one is the best one yet.<br /><br />The story is pretty interest 3 teen boys get super powers by being exposed to an alien rock. The 3 boys now can make things move, build up force field and even fly! The best part I liked about the movie is when they are flying around the sky and playing football with each other. I thought to myself, wow, I never seen that before in a movie. It would be so cool, if I could fly like that!<br /><br />This movie is awesome because it is so much better than the before Found Video movies. The story is great, the filming is better, and the character development made sense. I definitely recommend this movie!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|really good! i reccomend this to everyone. well i have nothing else to say so im gonna type in rsdnom stuff now like this
B00701QVVY|5.0|From the first song to the last, this cd is easily the best Overkill...ever!  Understand I love Overkill, since I first heard \\"Years of Decay\\" back in the 80's, I have followed them and anxiously awaited each new effort they have released.  Although every cd has been quality, after \\"From the Underground...\\", I felt each cd had a few imperfections.  For instance, I, myself, can listen to their earlier efforts through and through and get into each and every track. With the latter having a song or two I might skip while listening.  Nothing too serious obviously, just had a different vibe or something...like maybe they were stretching it, in terms of creativity.  \\"Ironbound\\" was a decent cd, but in my opinion, still didnt capture the glory days \\"feel\\".  \\"The Electric Age\\" returns Overkill to rare form indeed.  If any of the first 4-6 albums are sentimental favs...you'll find what youve been looking for right here.  my only fault with \\"The Electric Age\\" is...the last song, without changing any of the lyrics or anything, shouldve been titled \\"Knocked the F Out!!!\\"  Cuz thats what I was after I listened to it.  Now if you\\"ll excuse me.  I have to go \\"Drop the Hammer Down\\"
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have never read a book about bondage or submission, but oh my god this book had me up all night wondering what Christian was going to do. And what Ana was going to do. oh my god, E. L. James, you have a follower for life. Starting book 2 after this review.. xoxox
B002S395DK|5.0|I was more than blown away by this album, this band is amazing. Hearing this on vinyl gives me the chills that i got the first time i heard these songs.....AMAZING!!!! DONT THINK BUUUUUUY!!!!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Yes.  Finally...now let's see what all the hyper is about.  Can't wait to start playing on my Kindle Fire.  Nice.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Love this game &amp; glad that it finally came out on Android. Easy to play for all ages. Downloading is simple &amp; you can play right away.
0345803485|2.0|This book was not what i was expecting. I heard all this ranting and raving about it. I was excited to read it! But it totally fell flat. I agree with the people who said that it seems like it was written by a 15 year old. She uses all the same adjectives, and i even found some mistakes, like the classic \\"you and me\\" its \\"you and I\\", another 15 year old aspect of the writing was how she couldn't even say a word like penis? It was all he touched me \\"down there\\".. ooo how erotic.. not? I also was not expecting the whole dom sub thing either. overall it was an OK story line for a book, but she did not execute it right at all.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this is like the best app ever. i can never stop playing it and i was really happy when it came out for the kindle fire! whoo hoo!! :) :) :) :)
0345803493|3.0|I read the first book and i did not like it. But i decided to give the second one a chance, because honestly she got my attention at the end. I think the second book is still not written well at all, too many of the same phrases used over and over. BUT the story line of this book is so much better i couldn't even believe it. It cough my attention, it kept me reading. I thought that there was WAYYYY TO MUCH SEX, AND IT WAS ALL THE SAME, BORING, REDUNDANT. The sex scene are also not realistic at all. Id like to me any women that can climax as much as Ana Steele can. I'm an experienced young women, and this book does not even come close to what it's really like. The sex scenes also seem a little fast, Mr. Grey obviously does not have any stamina. Overall this book had a better story line, I liked all the twists and turns. The book actually would be much better without all the sex. One other thing, the ending of this book was done very well, it cough my attention again. But for some reason I have not bought the third book yet, I do not think I can take anymore of the bad writing.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I really like how the game will take your time and X2&times;170230000+6 ON THE TIME YOU CAN HARVEST.  I stoped playing for 3 days cud 117 hrs is quite a wait..  disappointing ........

B00012QM8G|5.0|I've had teh VHS of this film for ages. Glad that I finally ahve the DVD. It's not one to watch over and over frequently - too disturbing. This is not for the faint of heart - not those who wish to bury their heads in teh sand over what has happened nad is still happening in the world.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The best part of this app is it is accessabile from my android phone, my iPod, my Kindle Fire, and via the Web.
B0055S348W|3.0|So I thought I would finally try this app for my Kindle Fire. The test page printed fine using the generic driver, so I purchased the pro key. If I use the Google cloud print, I can print anything I choose, then I wondered why in the world I paid full price for this app. and got the pro key. If I choose to print to a near-by wi-fi printer, a message pops up telling me I need to purchase the pro-key. What is going here? I purchase the pro key but can find no place to enter this information. On every desktop/laptop I own, I can enter the userid and P/W. Since I can print anything I want to the cloud and have it printed out by the time I reach my wi-fi printer, I'm still trying to understand why I paid for the pro version. I'm using the same printer except I'm directing the flow to the cloud first then to my wi-fi printer. Love to hear from others who have purchased this for their Kindle Fire and how you've gotten the required usedid & p/w into the KF. I gave this app 3 stars because it works but not as advertised. I see the quantity page limit on the desktop/laptop installations but I haven't even come close to needing to print a job with that many pages. Besides if I split a job that had 30 pages and printed it in two separate instances, what's the point of limitation?
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This series is amazing! Once you meet Christian Grey, you will lose sleep and it will be well worth it. This story further captivates you with the wonderful development of the characters both individually and together. I would definitely recommend this book..
B004FOA84A|5.0|I really like this game but I'm stuck at the part with the weight in the fire I don't know how to get it out!! Any ideas??
B0015XHP4K|4.0|Good picture quality for an 80's movies on blu ray while audio is somewhat good too. A nice box set to own if you are a fan.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|it wouldn't load looked fun but never got a chance to play. been 2 days still hasn't loaded. that's why its a 3
B000FC1HBY|4.0|If you liked the first you will like the second.  I have never read a story where the next book picks up as if it is just a continuation of the first.  There are no recaps or any type of synopsis of the first. The story grows larger with each chapter with more characters and more places.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|finally this app is on here. i love this app and hopefully there will soon be a color uptate(more packages). great app!
B004X80QNG|1.0|No sync with Google and no widget make android version crap. Fix these issues and it would be awesome. Really, just fix it.
1608191664|4.0|Ha-Joon Chang does a good job, in this book, debunking some of the standard myths about capitalism (23 of them to be exact). The downside to Ha-Joon Chang's book is that he relies mostly on anecdotal evidence and arguments. The book is clearly geared towards as wide an audience as possible, and is meant to be accessible to anyone, even those with no formal training in economics (which is a good thing), but this limits Ha-Joon Chang to fairly informal arguments.<br /><br />That does not necessarily limit the value of the book for those who, like me, are sympathetic to Ha-Joon Chang's arguments and his positions, but this book is unlikely to convince very many people who are hostile to Ha-Joon Chang's general position. I want to stress that the informality of Ha-Joon Chang's arguments does not mean, as some of the negative reviewers seem to think, that his arguments are wrong. It simply means that they need to be supplemented with models and statistical evidence, something that the motivated reader can pursue on their own. Ha-Joon Chang does cite a number of articles and books for the reader who wants to dive a bit more deeply into Ha-Joon Chang's arguments.<br /><br />If you are simply looking for a book that critiques some of the central dogmas of free-market capitalism, and are not necessarily interested in delving deeply into economic theory, then I think Ha-Joon Chang's book is excellent. In the rest of my review I will summarize a few of the the \\"Things\\" that I found most interesting, for anyone who wants a taste of what they will get from Ha-Joon Chang's book.<br /><br />Thing 1: There is no such thing as a free market<br /><br />Ha-Joon Chang makes a number of interesting points in this \\"Thing\\". First, he notes that, \\"Every market has some rules and boundaries that restrict freedom of choice\\" (1). Examples, are restrictions on what kinds of things can be traded (we cannot trade in votes or internal organs, etc.), as well as who can participate in markets (child labor laws, licensing for doctors, etc.). Markets are, as Ha-Joon Chang argues, \\"propped up\\" by such rules. There is no such thing as a totally free-market that would be nothing but the free interactions between individuals (except, perhaps, the black market). Every market requires restrictions, institutions, rules, etc. in order to function at all.  Most of these regulations are invisible because we accept the regulations, and endorse the moral values they imply, without even thinking about it.<br /><br />Regulations become conspicuous when we do not endorse the moral values they imply (for example, when the government attempts to redistribute wealth by raising taxes on higher income brackets, or when they attempt to place restrictions on banking activities, etc.). The important point here is that these arguments (about what restrictions are justified) are moral arguments. They involve questions of values and cannot, therefore, be determined scientifically. Whether we consider banking regulations legitimate depends on moral arguments (the value we place on the freedom to engage in trade, versus the value we place on people's rights to be protected from negative externalities, etc.).<br /><br />Ha-Joon Chang also rightly points out the relativity of rights. For example, in Korea, apparently, the customer is not allowed to return merchandise simply because they decided they did not like it. This is seen as a protection of the rights of the seller. In Britain, the customer is allowed to return merchandise for whatever reason they want, and this is seen as a protection of the rights of the buyer. Rights always imply a duty. If someone has a right not to be murdered, this implies a duty, on the part of other people, not to murder them. So whenever one protects someone's \\"right\\" to something, one is also enforcing a \\"duty\\" on someone else, and it is always possible to adopt the other perspective and claim that rights are being infringed by the imposition of such duties.<br /><br />To use another analogy, speeding laws restrict people's freedom to drive whatever speed they want, and one could argue, that such laws are infringements on the rights of drivers. But drivers also have a right to be protected from the negative consequences of the actions of others (what in economics are known as externalities). When people speed they are more likely to get into car accidents. One could argue, therefore, that the speeding laws are a way of protecting rights, rather than infringing on them, and whether you view such a policy as a protection, or an infringement, of rights will always depend on the perspective you adopt. The same argument could be made in regard to banking regulations, or, virtually any attempt at government regulation of the market, including the health care mandate, that is currently raising such a fuss. The government is capable of infringing on individual rights through regulations, but it is also capable of protecting individual rights through regulations, and those who turn the government into the perennial \\"bad guy\\" are viewing the world in a very simplistic way, or, from a very limited perspective.<br /><br />Thing 2: Companies should not be run in the interest of their owners<br /><br />Thing 2 can be summarized more briefly. Basically, the notion that companies should be run in the interests of their shareholders is a mistake. Shareholders, due to their mobility (they can sell their shares at any time) have the least stake in the long-term future of the company. As Ha-Joon Chang points out, \\"shareholders...prefer corporate strategies that maximize short-term profits, usually at the cost of long-term investments, and maximize the dividends from those profits, which even further weakens the long-term prospects of the company by reducing the amount of retained profit that can be used for re-investment\\" (12).<br /><br />The problem of the disconnect between ownership and management has been a problem for awhile. This problem was supposedly solved in the 1980s with the principle of shareholder value maximization. Managers would be rewarded \\"according to the amount they can give to shareholders\\" (17). But as Ha-Joon Chang argues, this \\"solution\\", was financed \\"by squeezing the other stakeholders in the company...Jobs were ruthlessly cut, many workers were fired and re-hired as non-unionized labour with lower wages and fewer benefits...The suppliers, and their workers, were also squeezed by continued cuts in procurement prices, while the government was pressured into lowering corporate income tax rates and/or providing more subsidies\\" (18). This all wound up redistributing income from wages towards profits. Standard theory argues that such a redistribution should lead to increased investment but, in reality, investment as a share of national output actually fell. That means that running the company in the interests of the shareholders does not benefit the company itself, nor does it benefit the economy as a whole.<br /><br />Thing 6: Greater macroeconomic stability has not made the world economy more stable<br /><br />What Ha-Joon Chang means by \\"greater macroeconomic stability\\" is price stability (i.e. low inflation). Since the 1970s policies have been adopted to keep inflation in check, and they have been largely successful, but, contrary to the claims made by the advocates of such policies, this has not produced greater economic stability (or performance) overall. Quite the opposite, and for fairly logical reasons.<br /><br />Financial instability (in the form of more frequent and deeper financial crises) has increased partly due to the fact that higher interest rates (which are meant to control inflation) shift investment from non-financial investments (which have lower risk, but also lower return) to higher risk, higher return financial investments. This imbalance increases financial instability. Job insecurity has also increased, which, Ha-Joon Chang argues, \\"was the result ofstringent anti-inflationary macroeconomic policies\\" (60).<br /><br />Ha-Joon Chang points out that there is little to no evidence that low levels of inflation are bad for an economy. Ha-Joon Chang cites two studies, carried out by economists at the University of Chicago, and the IMF (institutions that are associated with free-market economics), which suggest that levels of inflation between 10-20 percent have low negative effects on growth, and below 8 percent inflation actually has a positive effect on growth (267 fn. 2).<br /><br />Thing 13: Making rich people richer doesn't make the rest of us richer<br /><br />In this Thing Ha-Joon Chang attempts to debunk the trickle down view of economics. Ha-Joon Chang argues that there has been a growth in pro-rich (neoliberal) policies since the 1980s. These policies have been effective at redistributing wealth up the ladder but they have not, as their advocates claimed they would, led to higher investment or higher growth, \\"despite rising inequality since the 1980s, investment as a ratio of national output has fallen in all G7 economies...and in most developing countries\\" (145).<br /><br />The political debate in the United States has often been premised on the assumption that we have to choose between efficiency and equality. We can adopt policies that reduce income inequality but these will inevitably reduce efficiency (i.e. the lower income brackets will get a bigger share of the pie but the pie will be smaller). As Ha-Joon Chang points out, this is a false dilemma. We do not need to choose between equality and efficiency since, \\"there are many reasons to believe that downward income redistribution can help growth, if done in the right way at the right time\\" (146).<br /><br />Thing 16: We are not smart enough to leave things to the market<br /><br />There is a common argument that you hear among free-market economists that goes something like this: sure, markets are prone to failure, but, government failures are worse, therefore, it is better to leave markets alone, and allow them to solve their own problems.<br /><br />It has long been admitted, for example, that contrary to Adam Smith's invisible hand, individually rational actions often lead to collectively irrational results. A bank run is an example that is easy to understand. If you think the bank that is holding your money might fail it is rational for you to withdraw your money. If, however, everyone acts \\"rationally\\" in such a situation it produces a collectively irrational result (i.e. it causes the bank failure). The example of bank runs is a clear example of an instance in which government regulation was able to reduce collectively irrational results (by insuring banks through the FDIC).<br /><br />It is often argued that in order to effectively regulate these collectively irrational results the government must have more information than individuals. But, Ha-Joon Chang, points out, this is not necessarily the case. Government regulations often work by restricting choices and, thereby, reducing the complexity of problems. Since human beings have \\"bounded rationality\\" (we have a limited grasp of our situation) this restriction actually improves our ability to act rationally.<br /><br />Ha-Joon Chang writes, \\"many regulations work not because the government necessarily knows better than the regulated...but because they limit the complexity of the activities, which enables the regulated to make better decisions\\" (176). Ha-Joon Chang proposes that the government place restrictions on the use of new financial instruments, until their safety can be tested, similar to the restrictions placed on new drugs. The government does not limit the use of new drugs because it believes it knows more about them than the chemists who invented them. It is in recognition of the fact that humans are limited in their ability to grasp complex situations, and unintended consequences, that the government places regulations on the use of new drugs. The same applies to new financial instruments.<br /><br />Thing 22: Financial markets need to become less, not more efficient<br /><br />The basic argument here is that \\"given the liquidity of their assets, the holders of financial assets are too quick to respond to change, which makes it difficult for real-sector companies to secure the 'patient capital' that they need for long-term development. The speed gap between the financial sector and the real sector needs to be reduced, which means that the financial market needs to be deliberately made less efficient\\" (232).<br /><br />The ability of finance to derive new assets from existing assets (like mortgages) led to \\"an increasingly tall structure of financial assets teetering on the same foundation of real assets\\" (239). This is, as we learned recently, a very unstable situation to be in, since this whole structure depends on the original assets retaining their value. The financial system obviously performs necessary functions, but the asymmetry between the real and financial sectors has led to a very unstable economy. Reducing the efficiency of the financial sector, to some degree, will reduce this asymmetry.<br /><br />This is merely a taste of some of the \\"myths\\" that Ha-Joon Chang addresses in this book, to whet the appetite of the prospective reader. If you find these things interesting I recommend picking up a copy of Ha-Joon Chang's book.stringent anti-inflationary macroeconomic policies\\" (60).<br /><br />Ha-Joon Chang points out that there is little to no evidence that low levels of inflation are bad for an economy. Ha-Joon Chang cites two studies, carried out by economists at the University of Chicago, and the IMF (institutions that are associated with free-market economics), which suggest that levels of inflation between 10-20 percent have low negative effects on growth, and below 8 percent inflation actually has a positive effect on growth (267 fn. 2).<br /><br />Thing 13: Making rich people richer doesn't make the rest of us richer<br /><br />In this Thing Ha-Joon Chang attempts to debunk the trickle down view of economics. Ha-Joon Chang argues that there has been a growth in pro-rich (neoliberal) policies since the 1980s. These policies have been effective at redistributing wealth up the ladder but they have not, as their advocates claimed they would, led to higher investment or higher growth, \\"despite rising inequality since the 1980s, investment as a ratio of national output has fallen in all G7 economies...and in most developing countries\\" (145).<br /><br />The political debate in the United States has often been premised on the assumption that we have to choose between efficiency and equality. We can adopt policies that reduce income inequality but these will inevitably reduce efficiency (i.e. the lower income brackets will get a bigger share of the pie but the pie will be smaller). As Ha-Joon Chang points out, this is a false dilemma. We do not need to choose between equality and efficiency since, \\"there are many reasons to believe that downward income redistribution can help growth, if done in the right way at the right time\\" (146).<br /><br />Thing 16: We are not smart enough to leave things to the market<br /><br />There is a common argument that you hear among free-market economists that goes something like this: sure, markets are prone to failure, but, government failures are worse,therefore, it is better to leave markets alone, and allow them to solve their own problems.<br /><br />It has long been admitted, for example, that contrary to Adam Smith's invisible hand, individually rational actions often lead to collectively irrational results. A bank run is an example that is easy to understand. If you think the bank that is holding your money might fail it is rational for you to withdraw your money. If, however, everyone acts \\"rationally\\" in such a situation it produces a collectively irrational result (i.e. it causes the bank failure). The example of bank runs is a clear example of an instance in which government regulation was able to reduce collectively irrational results (by insuring banks through the FDIC).<br /><br />It is often argued that in order to effectively regulate these collectively irrational results the government must have more information than individuals. But, Ha-Joon Chang, points out, this is not necessarily the case. Government regulations often work by restricting choices and, thereby, reducing the complexity of problems.

B0036ULAXW|5.0|This set would be a steal at twice the price. Austrian-born Otmar Suitner was a pupil of the great Clemens Krauss, and a lot of that esteemed maestro's genius for idiomatically inflected, songful performance is present here. These are not hard-core, high-drama performances where every climax is rushed and dynamic contrasts are pushed out to Wagnerian extremes.  Instead, Suitner reveals Dvorak's linkages to Schubert: the gorgeous melodies positively dance out of your speakers!  Not that Suitner doesn't understand the drama of Dvorak's darker moments: the performance of the Seventh Symphony reminds anyone with ears to hear that Dvorak was a structurally disciplined Great Composer of tremendous range and depth, not just a charming peddler of folk tunes haphazardly thrown together.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite performance is that of the still-neglected Sixth Symphony. Erich Leinsdorf -- another Austrian! -- virtually \\"owned\\" this symphony, producing magnificent recordings with the Cleveland Orchestra (1940s) and later with the Boston Symphony (1960s). Neither Leinsdorf recording is available today and I seriously regretted their absence until I heard Suitner. Like Leinsdorf, Suitner strikes the perfect balance between the requirements of song and structure in the first and last movements, unerringly shaping their stunningly dramatic climaxes. But Suitner never leaves you in doubt that the spiritual core of this symphony is its magnificent slow movement which he and the orchestra play in a way that can only be described as heart-stopping.  True, the Berlin Staatskapelle (ca. 1985) is not as great an orchestra as Leinsdorf's BSO, Szell's Cleveland Orchestra or Kertesz's London Symphony.  But they exhibit a wonderfully idiomatic sound that's just right for this music: lovely strings whose warm glow never overwhelms orchestral textures, and pert and tangy woodwinds that provide just the right amount of localized, rustic charm.<br /><br />The five discs are uniformly well-recorded, projecting a slightly diffuse but impactful orchestral sound that is transparent enough that individual instruments can be heard without unnatural spotlighting.  Packaging is very attractive, if a bit austere: the five CDs are housed in a compact box with minimal liner notes. But what really matters here is that Suitner has produced a Dvorak cycle of character and charm which, in its present incarnation, you can buy for about the price of one premium CD ....<br /><br />NOTE:  This same set was previously available with different cover art.

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I wish I had read some of the reviews before I got hooked on this game.  Mine did the same as many people's in that I played one afternoon, got back on an hour later, and everything had glitched to where I had to wait >65 hours to collect!  Is this some kind of way for the company to make more money?  You get mad, uninstall, reinstall and start over (i.e. spend more money), then hope it doesn't glitch again?  I would have given it 5 stars if I had reviewed it on day 1, but just wait 5 or 6 days and see what you'd give it then.  It's just a dirty shame, or should I say sham?

B005Y423ZC|5.0|This young woman deserves all her fame, acclaim and stardom. Adele's musical sophistication, instincts and individuality in one so young is extraordinary. And that voice. It's of a full, deep hue, with amazing resonance and ethereal overtones; she uses it consummately, and phrases with a great deal of maturity and skill.<br /><br />\\"21\\" is by now an international phenomenon, and it's likely to be recognized as one of the seminal, must-have recordings for vocal buffs. This album has crossed over to many varying cultures, and it's not hard to understand why.<br /><br />It's real. Adele is real, and she sings about real feelings, emotions and nuances. Her lyrics are arrestingly original, of her own vernacular and manner of expressions. Adele is like no one else: and *that* is the mark of a true, individual artist.<br /><br />What's remarkable about this concert, recorded at London's Royal Albert Hall in September of 2011, is that it is in many ways better than the studio recordings that preceded it. I have one major complaint about the \\"21\\" album, and that is the dry, digital acoustic. There is no warmth of space around Adele's voice, and she sounds very closely microphoned. Too, the engineering put the recording level way too high so that it causes a serious overload, with the result of distortion. However, on the vinyl incarnation (which I also bought), the levels are somehow much more even and natural.<br /><br />This DVD, then, appears to put Adele's huge voice, in the space of a large theater, in its proper venue.<br /><br />What I was not prepared for is how much more mellow, full and sweeter Adele's voice sounds here: it is at times an elemental force of nature.<br /><br />But what this concert captures is the *compleat* persona of Adele, and you see why she's certifiably, a genuine star artist. Her new, slimmer, blonde look here is quite becoming: she's breathtakingly gorgeous, and the radiance that emanates from her is unmistakeable. Her whole being is out there, larger than life; it jumps out to the audience, her rapport with them sealed, and they're smitten. On the one hand, she's everyone's chatty girlfriend, and friend girl; on the other, she's a song goddess.<br /><br />Adele is just as captivating speaking as singing: she could easily be a stand-up comic (and is far funnier than some of the ones out there). She's adorably refreshing, spontaneous, and vastly entertaining. Delightfully,laugh-out-loud funny, Adele is as real as real gets, and there's not a phony, pretentious bone in her body. She plays around with her accent, using it with great comic skill to relate her stories.  What also comes through is an absolutely genuine sincerity, and really shows heartfelt appreciation and generosity of spirit to her audiences. Adele has a singular commodity that cannot be bought or faked, and that is charm.<br /><br />When it comes to the music, however, Adele gets serious, and she delivers, and, as they say, then some. She offers a generous selection from both her \\"19\\" and \\"21\\" albums, with a few others included, \\"Lovesong,\\" \\"I Can't Make You Love Me,\\" \\"If It Hadn't Been For Love,\\" and \\"Make YOu Feel My Love.\\"<br /><br />But the heart of this concert are Adele's own compositions, and in this live setting, they gain an extra excitement and dimension. By the way, there are no thrashing dancers, cheap staging/lighting/special effects to be found here: Adele doesn't need them.<br /><br />Personally speaking, my favorite number, and her performance of it in this set, is \\"Set Fire To The Rain.\\"  Adele far outdoes her studio rendition here, singing with an inflamed fervor and white-heat passion; her voice soars with amazing abandon and it expands into the hall with overwhelming impact. The phrase \\"And it threw us into the flames\\" is simply magical; the ending, repeated runs to \\"Let it burn\\" indeed do burn with refulgent intensity (watch her face as she ends the song: she's living the emotion).<br /><br />Adele wisely ends the concert with her monster-mega hit \\"Rolling In The Deep,\\" which rouses the audience, as she often turns the microphone to them to sing along - which they do, perfectly in tune and on the beat. There is such a sense of occasion here, of pure, exalting joy, of glowing warmth and high spirits, you may find yourself clapping and singing along. The good time and happiness evinced by all signals Adele's heart-capture of her public; her legend is sealed.<br /><br />Thank you, Adele, for bringing great music to us all.cert with her monster-mega hit \\"Rolling In The Deep,\\" which rouses the audience, as she often turns the microphone to them to sing along - which they do, perfectly in tune and on the beat.

B000FC0SIM|5.0|The key to understanding \\"On Writing\\" is that SK offers no magical solution. He lays out his perspective and links it with his past experiences.<br /><br />King makes it clear that one of the oldest ways to master a craft is through lots of reading and lots of writing. He does offer a few tips, but by the end of the book (memoir of his craft?), an aspiring writer realizes no successful author has all of the answers nor has the golden nugget. It's humbling to hear it come from this distinguished native of Maine.<br /><br />For those unaware of his past, the book does connect his primitive beginnings and struggles with his successes and ultimately the accident that nearly killed him.<br /><br />My take, after spending two weeks slowly reading \\"On Writing,\\" is that King is a normal person. He provides us with stories through his perspective and his understanding of conveying words clearly and concisely.<br /><br />The only disappointment I have is that I did not read the book sooner.

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I was having a blast with this game until it started glitching out. The way it works is you have different buildings with different times until they reach maturity and you can collect money to buy more buildings and animals. Some buildings take a few minutes, others take a few hours depending on what it is. When I reached Level 19, all of the buildings suddenly changed from the normal times to 100 hours to reach maturity. I noticed this yesterday but figured it would be fixed by today. When I opened up my game today, everything was still at 100 hours, so the timer isn't even progressing. Additionally, your energy is supposed to renew itself (1 energy point every 3 minutes) but I'm still at 0 energy which is where I was last night when this occurred. I went onto several forums for this game and see that this has been happening for a very long time with no resolution. I'm sad to say I'll probably have to delete this game from my Kindle and find something else to do.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|Bought the series after seeing it splashed all over by the media. I can only assume the author is paying them a nickel for every time they say the title of the book. Also, the story seems copied from a fanfiction story based off the Twilight series. Story reads like the Authors wishlist from Amazon: Laptop, iPod, nice clothes, sexy underwear, blackberry, new house, first edition books, iPad. Plus, the dialogue between two main characters makes me throw up in my mouth . Then, Ana has no common sense at all and I felt like taking over on her beatings before the first book was even halfway read.  I am starting on the third novel and wishing I would have gotten a pedicure instead of these poorly written books. I am the kind of person that has to sit through a horrible movie or book because I have to know how the story ends so I should get back to the torture. If only I could get some pleasure out of this torture. I was reading it in bed and actually fell asleep and hit myself in the face with my Kindle.

B00479SVBU|1.0|It could be a great idea if it actually worked.  First off, the signal is absolutely horrible.  I don't know what some of these other people are talking about with \\"crystal clear sound\\".  No matter what frequency or settings it was on, at best it was half music, half static.  Not even close to being tolerable sound quality.  Secondly, the thing wouldn't put out any sound at all when I tried to use a flash drive.  I made sure it was the right format and everything.  It would read the folder and file names just fine and display it on the screen, and the timer would tick away saying it was playing the song....  but there was no music at all.  Then I tried using the 3.5mm jack it comes with and hook up my ipod.  THAT would play the music, but the signal is so weak it's a joke.  I'm just going to get a new damn deck in the car that has an AUX input like I did in my last car.  So, if you DON\\"T care about sound quality, this is the product for you!
B003H4I4JU|1.0|I started this book with high hopes of it being equal or better than Enders Game...boy was I mistaken. I started the book and at first i just gave it some time to see if it would get any better...NOPE. This book has little to no action and Ender doesnt even come in until like 75 pages in. Do not buy this book. I advise you to just stop at Enders Game if you dont want disapointment.

I loved the characters and I didn't want it to end. It is a fascinating book and I really really recommend it to all that just enjoy a good book.

0345803507|5.0|This book was everything you could want in a great novel.  It was heartbreaking, suspensful, every emotion you can think of is in this 3rd book in the trilogy! You wont want it to end, i know i wanted to go to book 4! which i sure hope she does someday.<br /><br />Christain Grey is as another reader puts it the alpha male, omg everything you could want in a man but he has baggage and the only woman to understand him in 27 yrs is Anastashia! She takes him thru every emotion he has repressed in his life and helps him get farther along that dr flynn.  What an amazing woman she has turned out to be from that shy 20 yr old college student.  He would give her the world and she is slowly learning how to be rich as it is hard for her.  They are good for each other in every sense and this book brings all of that around and makes this the love story of the century! It stinking blows Titanic away and good grief i cannot wait to see the movie.  After book 1 there isnt much of the bdsm in their lives even thou lil ole Ana likes her sex that is for sure and there is only one man for her and one woman for him! EL James takes you to that and makes you believe it the description of places they go and the love they have for each other and their families!!! That also gets deeper in this book and you see how much both of their fams mean to them.<br /><br />Ana and Christian together are the epitomy of a great couple, opposites attract! And there are lots of twists and turns in book 3 but please read it you will love it to death as I did all 3 books but esp. this one. The ending was fabulous. Always believe never give up!If i could giv it 6 stars i would but can so it got a hi 5.
B0071R43MG|5.0|Why? Because of the attention deficit disorder many film editors have these days when creating concert DVDs, with their seizure-inducing camera angle switching every 1.3 seconds. This has been somewhat of a disappointment for me on past Joe concerts (until this disc, Live in San Francisco was my favorite). Satchurated will have NONE of that!<br /><br />It's great to see Joe in Blu-Ray. I confess I have NOT watched the 3D part of the film, just the 2D. Regardless, the high definition really lends itself to what is going on with Joe's hands. There's a bit of digital grain here and there, most likely due to the low-lighting of the venue, which is forgivable. There's also some very mild camera shake on the mounted cameras when the bass drum kicks, but I've seen that on so many other concert DVDs that I'm willing to let that pass. Regardless, the venue looks great and Joe looks great. Joe is in his fifties now, and isn't slowing down at all in my opinion.<br /><br />The audio is superb in its mix and presentation. The bass guitar could have been a little higher in the mix, but that's not to say it isn't present. The keyboards - oh, the keyboards! I love that Joe brought in Mike Keneally for this project. The keyboards (more below) sit just perfectly in the mix for me - not too high or too low. Campitelli's drums were especially notable - the cymbal decay is crisp and tight, the bass drum is punchy but not overbearing, and the toms are miced perfectly. I was actually surprised when I flipped the disc over and saw that it was only recorded at 24-bit/48kHz (which is the DVD standard - I've seen Blu-Rays up to 24/192). I thought I was hearing something in the 88kHz+ range. So I congratulate the sound engineers for their recording, mixing, and mastering on this album (which is probably 100 times harder to get right than studio recordings). I haven't ripped the album to FLAC yet for a dynamic range test, but I don't think I need to. I'm guessing it probably scores around 8 or9 on the JusticeforAudio Dynamic Range meter, which I consider to the be the \\"sweet spot\\" for rock music. The CD might yield a different dynamic range measurement, however.<br /><br />The setlist: Wow, where to begin? Joe's latest album was a real pleasure to me. He out-did himself with songwriting, and even created some songs which are a bit unusual for JS album. He picked what I consider the high-points of the latest album and included them here. Joe also played a lot of his back catalog that is in usual rotation, with the addition of a couple of rare gems, like \\"Why\\", probably one of my most favorite JS tunes, and one which is grossly overlooked. He did, however, gloss over the middle of his discography in creating this setlist. There's practically nothing from his albums of the mid 90s through the mid 2000s. We do get a scorching performance on \\"Crystal Planet,\\" however. But I was hoping for some of his more well-recognized tracks from that era like \\"Until We Say Goodbye\\" (which wouldn't have been much of a problem, since Mike Keneally was standing right there for synth accompaniment), \\"Starry Night\\" would have been great, the once controversial \\"If I Could Fly,\\" \\"Time Machine,\\" or \\"Cool #9.\\" Regardless, I'm not knocking off a star because in my opinion Wormhole Wizards trumps pretty much Joe's last three albums by a mile, and it is still the centerpiece of the show.<br /><br />The crew: Wow, hearing JS songs with synth/keyboard accompaniment is spectacular. Keneally's presence isn't annoying, he plays well, (there's even some back-and-forth musical banter between Joe and Mike that displays their mutual improvisational talents - both of them even playing their instruments with their mouths!), and lends some texture to many of Joe's songs (even those with no original keyboards extant) which gives this concert disc a \\"fuller\\" production feel and flavor. Allen Whitman is a capable bassist (still no Stu Hamm, but Stu is a rarity), just don't pay attention to his picking technique, which is all wrong (but who cares? he gets the job done, and does it well). Galen Henson's rhythm guitar is pretty low in the sound mix, sometimes to the point that I can't pick it out (and I'm listening with audiophile grade equipment). Campitelli is... the usual Campitelli. He's having fun the whole time, and playing JS songs isn't something that requires world-class drumming anyway.<br /><br />Lastly, I probably would have bought this Blu-Ray if all I saw of it was \\"Andalusia.\\" It was the ONLY song I enjoyed on the \\"Satchifunkulous\\" album. The reason for this is because Joe does ALL of his signature guitar sounds all packed into about a 7 minute window - whammy dives, harmonics, pick scrapes, tremolo picking, sweep picking, etc. etc. and more etc. I don't even know all the names of the techniques he employs, but \\"Andalusia\\" is the quintessential JS track for me. If anybody were ever to ask me to demonstrate Joe's abilities, I could condense it down into one song for them, and this one is it. I mention it aside from the rest of the setlist of the concert because - and I didn't even think it was possible - Joe actually puts EVEN MORE technique into Andalusia than he did in the studio, and it gives me chills watching it.<br /><br />If you're a casual fan, big-time fan, or just getting to know Joe, pick up the Blu-Ray.

B0049P1N3K|5.0|I read this book during hurricane Irene by the light of a lantern. Enjoyed and loved it so much that I downloaded it on my kindle fire. There are times when I've had a stressful day at work that I'll read passages from it while I'm on my lunch hour.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is so addicting. if you like killing zombies on xbox then I think you will like this game too. I can not seem to stop playing.
1401937519|4.0|As a Wayne Dyer fan I read of the experiences of the Author and about her book. I was intrigued so I read it.<br /><br />I thank the Author for sharing her incredible story. I loved learning about her upbringing among many cultures and the challenges it brought to her as she came of age. I loved the detail she gives of her life and when she first found out about the cancer. Her incredible journey is a lesson to us all regarding how we live our lives and whether or not there is a life after this one. If you're a doubter I would say you might just want to read this incredible book.<br /><br />I couldnt put the book down through the first three quarters. Her experience with the 'next life' is well told, in incredible detail and brilliance. I found truth in her writings. The fact that her experiences with coming back to life and knowing her Doctors who she had not met and recovering clearly from lymphoma are both fascinating and enlightening. The fact they were later researched and documented by another Doctor make her credibility very high.<br /><br />I personally struggled with her last three chapters of what I guess were conclusions and recommendations left me wanting a bit. It seemed redundant to me but I can say the first three quarters of the book are well worth the price. An incredible true story from a wonderful young lady and it brings so many lessons for all of us.<br /><br />I categorize my books and this goes under my Life Changers!<br /><br />I might end with this is not a religious book but a powerful spiritual one. There is a lesson in there too!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I figured out why it's a real Page Turner - because you're always waiting for SOMETHING exciting to happen.... But it never does!<br />SEE UPDATE AT THE END OF REVIEW:<br /><br />First, about me:<br />I read mostly non-fiction books like biographies, books political or ecological in nature, or about meditation, Paganism, Buddhism, etc.  But I decided to try some light, fun, sexy reading, again. Everywhere I looked I saw Fifty Shades of Grey mentioned. OK, so I give it a try.<br /><br />Well, I will admit this; I don't know WHY, but there's something about these books that keeps me turning the pages. (I'm just a few chapters into book Three - Fifty Shades Freed).<br />What it is, I can't figure it out because the writing really is pretty sub-par, as many have already mentioned.<br />If I read \\"... his breath hitches...\\" one more time, I was going to put an ice pick in my eye.<br />Same thing with the phrases \\"...I felt his erection against my hip...\\" and \\"...I glanced at him through my lashes...\\" \\"...she glanced up through her lashes...\\" \\"...he glanced at me through dark lashes...\\"<br />Well, you get the idea. Verrrry repetitive.<br /><br />Here's a hint for the author: If you're going to use an unusual phrase or word - do NOT use it more than once or twice in the entire book! Another hint: If you describe a simple repetitive action or quirk a character has, do it somewhat differently each time.<br />Better yet, don't give your characters annoying and cloying repetitive actions or catch phrases AT ALL.<br /><br />I'd also like to mention that there is a long, highly detailed sex scene every 3-5 pages,(literally!)- in both the first two books. It's as predictable as sunshine in the Caribbean. About the sex scenes; Pretty standard; a bit more racy and unique than the usual romance novels because of the Dom/Sub genre, but nothing too shocking or uncomfortably explicit.<br /><br />I have to agree with others about the absolutely ridiculous character premise in these books. A 26-27 yr old suave, debonaire, worldly billionaire? Who was adopted out of a horrifying, abusive childhood around 6 or 7? Really?? I could not wrap my mind around that notion - at all!<br />I mean he had to go to college, right? So, how could he possibly accumulate BILLIONS of dollars, tons of real estate, and own businesses all over the country in 5 years? Seriously stupid.<br />In MY mind's eye, Grey was at least 38-40 yrs old. And Ana, in MY mind, was about 30-32, and certainly NOT a virgin, although having limited experience I could believe. But her personality / insecurities were absolutely at high school senior level. I began to find her self-doubt and gasping to herself \\"What does he mean by that?\\" over and over again quite tedious. True I was trying to picture her as a 30+ yr old and not merely 21 like in the book, but still, she was exceptionally immature and childish.<br /><br />The more I review this book (books) the more I'm realizing it is nothing more than a \\"trashy, light-reading beach book\\" and well, there's a place for those kinds of books I guess. Summer is around the corner!<br /><br />UPDATE: Finished all three books. Well, sort of finished. I began somewhere in the first half of the third book to skim through the repetitive sex scenes (still every 3-5 pages like clock-work). The third book contained SOME brief non-sexual \\"action\\" concerning Ana and other characters; a slight taste of intrigue, but it was not nearly enough to 'Save\\" the trilogy from being BAD, BAD, BAD. I also see that the last book has 2 or 3 \\"false endings\\".  If you read it, you'll see what I mean.  I couldn't be bothered reading the last (?) one.  I'd had enough!<br />At $9.99 a pop on Kindle for each book, this was absolutely the crappiest trilogy for the money! There is no reason these three books could not be combined into ONE big (crappy) book.<br /><br />*** And by the way, is this the future for eReading?? High priced downloads on even the trashiest books?? A downloaded book should cost MUCH LESS than a real paperback! The production costs are minimal compared to publishing and distributing a real paperback! ***aded book should cost MUCH LESS than a real paperback! The production costs are minimal compared to publishing and distributing a real paperback! ***
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game isn't terribly difficult but it has enough challenge to keep u playing. the in game hints are very well done when u get stuck
B003D0ZNWY|5.0|The combination of value and quality in this comprehensive collection is unbeatable.  For those of us who do not own a number of multiple versions of classical pieces, this is a great way to own some of these pieces and compare differing interpretations without breaking your bank.<br /><br />I've gotten through half of the cds so far and, although I have a modestly comprehensive collection of Mahler, I own only one of the 16 included in the collection.<br /><br />I think this is a great gift idea for a young musician interested in trying new venues or for anyone interested in Mahler's music.  Sure there are a few pieces that may not be the best ever, but all are good and worth a listen.  Just a great value and collection.

B000JMKQX0|3.0|Not a bad read at all.  Very realistic in its portrayal of subject matter that's been addressed in so very many ways.  It wasn't spell-binding reading, but almost like a Discovery Channel documentary.  I enjoyed it.

B003P2WO5E|5.0|I've always liked Brandon Sanderson, but this book was above and beyond.  It's a huge book that I couldn't put down until it was over.  My family missed me, and I'm already ready for the next installment.  =D
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Loved this book!  I have already read The Secret and The Power but this book is both of those rolled into one and even more.  The 28 day challenge is easy to follow and worth every effort to stick to it. It will make a difference in your life!
B0054YH8DY|2.0|I just purchased this cd, loaded it, and then proceded to fast forward through most of the songs.  People, and the album jacket, claim this is their 'best' album???????<br />I must be living on a different plain.....this cd was a waste of money, I doubt I'll play it again.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|OMG I love this app soooooo........ much it is a lot of fun!!!!!!  its my favorite game on my kindle fire I love it!!!!! I would highly recomind getting this app
B004WJRFYE|5.0|I guess I'm not as captious as some, but I found these vinyl recordings to be superior to the original LP.  Aye, getting the records out of the sleeves was a bit more difficult than usual but nothing that ruin my day or affect the rating I gave these LPs.  Being a drummer, I listen for different sounds than others.<br /><br />LP1: I found the brush work in \\"Singalong Junk\\" (and \\"Junk\\" itself) cutting through beautifully--as were the cymbals.  The acoustic guitar was more apparent on the high end.  Bass drum and bass guitar were more evident.  Anytime Paul used the snare with the high, crisp sound always sounded better to me than the garbage-can snare sound.  the standout songs here are still \\"Every Night,\\" \\"Teddy Boy,\\" and \\"Maybe I'm Amazed.\\"<br /><br />LP2:  [Side A] Love the new harmonies on \\"Every Night.\\" (Think I heard the same version on an Unplugged concert.] Hearing the whole version (even though an outtake) of \\"Suicide\\" was interesting.  Glad to know there was more to the song than that little snippet at the end of \\"Valentine Day.\\" I also enjoyed the vocal--and the reverb on the vocal--live version of \\"Maybe I'm Amazed.\\"<br />[Side B] Still another version of \\"Maybe I'm Amazed.\\"  I don't know of a version of this song that doesn't sound excellent.\\"  Hot as Sun sure sounded different, but I guess McCartney can't play all the instruments during a live concert.  \\"Oo You\\" becomes the outtake called Don't Cry Baby\\" (complete with the admonition of Paul to one of the children).  It's also become an effective instrumental.  Then there's Women Kind.  Very funny but I can see the wisdom in leaving it off the original McCartney LP.

B005VPRETE|5.0|Lego has long retreated into a land where only boys are allowed. A few gender neutral toys existed, but not many. I was a Tom Boy and happily played with Star Wars Legos, but my daughter is not, and was having a Lego-free childhood, due to the lack of appeal to her. That *goodness* Lego has turned this trend around! I'm all for gender equality, but there's nothing wrong with a girl getting to enjoy play that she would enjoy in real life, and who doesn't love the idea of having one's own fancy tree-house. My 7 year old daughter, with no previous Lego set experience, picked it up and with only a few minutes of guidance spent an hour or more assembling the set with focus and enjoyment. The result was a detailed and adorable play set. It's small (look at the dimensions to make sure you have a good expectation) but the biggest plus is, it has not only provided the initial play value of assembly, but she has come back to it, in combination with other sets to enjoy pretend play and imaginative play. This set is wonderful and very popular with all the girls in her first grade class. Thank you Lego!
B003AQBYUG|5.0|Great packaging, works on all blu ray players, movies are so so but entertaining. Cheaper than American release. No reason not to save.
B004LWZW7E|3.0|Disappointing. An interesting idea, but something went wrong. Director Andrew Niccol few years ago made Gattaca, a provoking movie about genetic engineering. This time, however, Niccol wasn't so successful. The concept is fine; a future when time is literally money. But there are too many clichés. The whole class struggle thing is a bit old-fashioned and existential aspects of immortality were set aside. A final note about the actors: Justin Timberlake is a fine actor as well as Cillian Murphy.
B0030CBCDY|3.0|I have heard about this book for a long time and finally<br />sat down to read it. It caused alot of scandal when it was<br />first written in 1928 due to it's descriptions of sex in the book..<br />and my opinion is...(ahem) when compared to the paperback<br />romance novels of today,it is rather tame,probably a &#34;PG 13&#34;<br />or maybe rated &#34;R&#34;.<br />I thought the story itself was a bit bland and that is not to say<br />it is badly written,it is quite good but, I just din't get too involved<br />with it. For people who have not read it,it is the story of Constance<br />who is married to Clifford (who is in a wheelchair). Constance has<br />an affair with named Mellors(a groundskeeper). D.H.Lawrence the<br />author also injected some social commentary regarding rich versus<br />iddleclass,such as a &#34;middleclass&#34; man should watch out fooling around<br />with a wife of a rich man.<br />Oh,there was never any threats towards Mellors, i just think the author<br />included it because it had to do with HIS world at that time. Overall, I<br />thought the story was just-&#34;eh&#34;,just ok not,over the top spectacular. I<br />just read it to find out what the fuss was about.
B0041B785Y|5.0|Koloss has an otherworldly bleakness about it, like a deserted planet, with ragged mountain ranges that stretch as far as the eye can see, endless terrains of black brown rock and dust storms that turn the sun to a hovering, ghostly coin. Some people seem to view this feeling of bleakness as a 'boring' element that runs through the album, but I love that. I like the minimalism, the feeling of emptiness; it creates a sensation of space within and around the songs. Demiurge is a good example of this, with its eerie, ambient soundscapes (it grows into something quite sinister for me, cold and chilling towards the climax, which of course I adore) and the multi-layered, slow burning beauty of Behind The Sun. Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave It Motion sounds barren and dry until it floods into colour at 3:48 with those long, disquieting tunnels of guitar sound that seem to take us slowly, creeping into points of space. The Last Vigil takes this feeling of space into another dimension, an ethereal, haunting place full of forbidden geometry and strange, bleeding light.<br /><br />Koloss is intricate, dense and heavy. I love the drumming patterns on Marrow and Swarm and the way the twin guitar riffs slide away from each other like magnets on Marrow. The way the guitar notes on The Demon's Name Is Surveillance build and bend into something high, wild and intense, penetrating and peering into your mind like snaking, living cameras, and how Do Not Look Down seems to flow into a completely different song at exactly the 3:00 minute mark. The way the guitar (it sounds like a weird sliding backwards chord with bending strings) seems to pull my stomach muscles down at 0:18 (there are two more during the song, deliciously heavy, they occur at 1:06 and 3:46) on I Am Colossus, it feels exquisite, like falling through a trapdoor. I love the ascending chromatic riff during the chorus and the lead solo towards the end is beautifully-placed, having a 'siren-esque' quality to it, a little like the melody (or rather the atmosphere) you hear during Corridor Of Chameleons (at 2:02 and 3:55) from Chaosphere. The Demon's Name Is Surveillance has this siren-esque quality as well towards the end section at 3:30. You can hear elements of Chaosphere and Obzen throughout the album and for that matter, elements of Nothing and Catch 33.<br /><br />Koloss is an alien landscape. Beams of sunlight flicker in broken shafts on that black-brown surface. At certain angles, the light glints like gold upon those great stones. It is full of twists and turns like some leviathan puzzle box. What you find inside depends on how deeply you want to go into that box.<br /><br />Koloss. Bleak. Barren.

B0050QV0RQ|5.0|RPG buffs will definitely enjoy this game. The battle system is simple, as is the dialogue. Lots of cute, hokey dialogue. A good time all around.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I grew up playing the original OT. This version is a little different; it's an updated version. The game is just as entertaining, just more involved and with more rules. Fun game with lots of upgrades and advancements.
B006YTTVHO|1.0|A little bit disappointing... I thought it would be something else. Way too small (I read it in half an hour?). On the other side, it was free so...

B003Y5H5HO|5.0|'The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo', is one of the most talked about book seires these past few years and after reading the first instalment I understand why. It is a captivating white knuckle thriller that really breaks all the rules with bold and sometimes disturbing moments that just keep reading. So when they announced that an American version of the already made Sweedish film was on the way of course I was ready to go.<br /><br />The director David Fincher already was one of my favorite directors and I love his work and of course this time he directed another winner. While there were some differences from the transition of book to film it was a movie that was just as gripping and bold as the pages. The cast was great and I knew that Rooney Mara would do a great job portraying Lisbeth, even getting an academy award nomination. Daniel Craig can do no wrong and even Robin Wright supprised me a little in the role she played as well.<br /><br />I am a bit upset that this film didn't get the box office notice that it truly deserves, but at the same time a film that deals with some very debated topics is not one that the collective film going public would agree upon. I was happy that certain moments as graphic as the pages mentioned did show up on the film. I really hope that the universal concensious will not prevent the next two chapters from hitting the big screen and I hope that Fincher stays on to direct along with the cast and hopefully Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for the soundtrack.
